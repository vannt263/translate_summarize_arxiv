    ". the scale parameter @xmath20 ( expressed here in  ) is weakly wavelength dependent as : @xmath21 the errors on the equivalent widths that we list are simply the statistical errors on the best - fit line normalisation .",
    "table  [ tab : ovii ] also shows the systematic uncertainties expected for each line due to the uncertainty in the continuum level ; these systematic uncertainties were determined by shifting the continuum up and down by the 1@xmath9 statistical uncertainty in the average continuum flux for each local 0.5     bin and re - determing the equivalent width .",
    "uncertainties in the shape of the lsf also may affect the derived values of @xmath16 .",
    "we estimated this by modifying the lsf and determining how the equivalent width of the 21.60    line changes .",
    "for the letgs , a change of @xmath0 from 2 ( our preferred value ) to 2.5 ( the value used by the official ciao software ) but keeping the same fwhm by adjusting @xmath20 leads to a decrease of 0.4  m  ( 3.5  % ) in @xmath16 ; a decrease of @xmath20 by 10  % leads to a decrease of 0.5  m  ( 4.5  % ) in @xmath16 .",
    "if for the rgs instead of the true lsf a gaussian approximation would be used , the equivalent widths would be 2030  % too small . as shown by rasmussen et al .",
    "@xcite the uncertainty in the lsf gives slightly different results ( @xmath22  % ) as two different parameterisations of the lsf are used .",
    "for example , decreasing the fwhm of the lsf of the rgs by 10  % leads to a @xmath16 decrease of 2.3  m  ( 15  % ) .",
    "although the precise systematic uncertainty on @xmath16 due to the lsf shape is hard to establish accurately , it is most likely in the 515  % range for both letgs and rgs . taking this into account in addition to the statistical uncertainty on @xmath16 and the systematic uncertainty related to the continuum level ( table  [ tab : ovii ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that there is not a large discrepancy between the equivalent widths of the @xmath5 line measured by both instruments .",
    "the evidence for the two absorption components at @xmath8 ( 5.8@xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( 8.9@xmath9 ) as presented by nme looks at a first glance convincing . however , there are good reasons to put question marks to these significances .",
    "we follow here two routes : first we discuss the significance by looking into detail to the individual features identified by nme , and next we analyse the significance of the absorption components in a coherent way .",
    "nme found 28 or 24 absorption features with a significance of more than 3@xmath9 in their analysis of the combined letg / hrc - s and letg / acis spectrum .",
    "the precise number is somewhat unclear from their paper but is not important here . of these 24 lines ,",
    "14 have an origin at @xmath5 and there is no doubt about the significance of that component , so we focus on the 10 features with a tentative identification with @xmath6 absorption lines . in total 3 of",
    "these belong to the @xmath8 system , and 6 to the @xmath10 system .",
    "one feature at 24.97    was unidentified by nme .",
    "we will discuss these features here individually as we point out that not all of these detections can be regarded as unambiguous .",
    "the absorption component at @xmath8 had three features :    1 .",
    "1s2p at 19.18   : fig .",
    "[ fig : linecomp ] shows that there is only evidence for an absorption feature from the letg / acis spectrum , not from the letg / hrc - s or rgs spectra .",
    "the feature coincides exactly with a @xmath23 0.05    wide dip of 3  % depth in the effective area of the letg / acis , associated with an acis node boundary ( as was also pointed out by nme ) ; therefore this feature is most likely of instrumental origin .",
    "1s2p at 21.85   : there is no clear feature in the rgs spectrum , but there is a feature in both letgs spectra .",
    "however , the centroid in the letg / acis spectrum seems to occur at slightly longer wavelength , by @xmath23  0.01   .",
    "there are no known instrumental features in the letgs at this wavelength , so this may be real provided it has sufficient significance . but see sect .  [ sect : selfcons ] .",
    "1s2p at 25.04   : no feature present in the rgs deeper than 1  % ; the letg / hrc - s spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : linecomp ] ) shows a @xmath24  % negative deviation at a slightly smaller wavelength , and the ( here noisy ) letg / acis spectrum may be consistent with this .",
    "the smaller wavelength is consistent with the findings of nme , who give here a redshift of 0.010 instead of 0.011 .    in summary",
    ", the x - ray evidence for the 0.011 component rests solely upon the detection of two lines with different redshift and only seen in the letgs . as we will argue later",
    ", even the statistical significance of the combined features is insufficient to designate it as a robust detection .",
    "the component at @xmath10 had six features :    1 .",
    "1s2p at 13.80   : this feature coincides with a narrow dip in the effective area of the letg / acis associated with a node boundary , similar to the @xmath8 1s2p line .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that it is only seen in the letg / acis spectrum , with perhaps a little but not very significant strengthening from the letg / hrc - s spectrum .",
    "it is not visible in the rgs spectrum .",
    "more importantly , its best - fit redshift as reported by nme of 0.026 is off from the redshift of this component at @xmath10 .",
    "we conclude that this feature has an instrumental origin .",
    "1s3p at 19.11   : there is only a weak signal visible in the letg / hrc - s spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linecomp ] ) ; this looks a little less pronounced than in the plot given by nme but this may be due to different binning ; more importantly , given the weakness of the 1s2p transition in the same ion ( see below ) and the expected 5 times smaller equivalent width of the 1s3p line as compared to the 1s2p line makes any detection of the 1s3p line impossible .",
    "1s2p at 22.20   : only clearly seen in the letg / acis spectrum .",
    "no evident instrumental features are present . however , the redshift of 0.028 is slightly off from the redshift of this component at @xmath10 .",
    "1s2p at 25.44   : a weak feature is present mainly in the letg / hrc - s spectrum ; rgs1 may be consistent with this . given the weakness of the oxygen lines , a clear detection of would be surprising unless the absorber has an anomalously high nitrogen abundance . 5 .",
    "1s2p at 29.54   : here the letg / hrc - s spectrum has the best statistics and it shows indeed a shallow dip with four adjacent bins approximately 1@xmath9 below the reference level . the same remark as above about the nitrogen abundance can be made .",
    "moreover , there is nothing there in the rgs spectra .",
    "1s2p at 34.69   : as above the feature is mainly evident from the letg / hrc - s line .",
    "as the cosmic carbon abundance is significantly higher than the nitrogen abundance , this line is more likely to be detectable .",
    "again , the redshift of 0.028 is on the high side .    in summary",
    ", the detection of the @xmath10 component rests upon , seen only in the letg / acis spectrum , and the 1s2p lines of , and as well as the 1s3p lines of , seen only in the letg / hrc - s spectrum .",
    "none of these features is visible in both letgs configurations , not all of these lines have exactly the same redshift and some of the lines ( 1s3p and the nitrogen lines ) are problematic from a physical point of view .      in the previous section we have put several question marks to the significance and reliability of the nine @xmath8 and @xmath10 line identifications as derived from the letgs spectra by nme .",
    "nevertheless , some of the features identified by these authors indeed show negative residuals at the predicted wavelengths for these components , with a nominal statistical significance as determined correctly by nme .    however , the actual significance of these detections is much smaller , and actually as we show below the redshift components are not significant at all .",
    "this is due to two reasons .",
    "first , nme fitted line centroids for each component separately , and then determined the significance for each line individually . however , for all lines belonging to the same redshift component , the wavelengths are not free parameters but are linked through the value of the redshift .",
    "although nme later assess the significance of the components by fixing the wavelengths of the relevant lines , they first have established the presence of redshifted components and their redshift values by ignoring this coupling .",
    "their argument for `` noise '' in the wavelength solution of in particular the letg / hrc - s detector is not relevant here ; first , our improved treatment of the letgs gives smaller noise , but more importantly , if there is noise , then for each potential line the amplitude and direction of the noise are unknown , and therefore there is no justification for adjusting the line centroids by eye or by chi - square : the true wavelength alinearity might just have the opposite sign . the only way to do this unbiased is to couple the lines from different ions even before having found the redshifted components .",
    "the most important problem is however the number of trial redshifts that have been considered .",
    "nme started by looking to @xmath25 excesses in the data in order to identify the two redshift systems .",
    "however , a @xmath25 excess has only meaning for a line with a well - known wavelength based on _ a priori _ knowledge .",
    "for example , knowing that there is a highly ionised system with a given redshift in the line of sight makes it justified to look for or absorption lines at precisely that redshift . here",
    "this a priori knowledge is lacking ( only _ a posteriori _ circumstantial evidence based on galaxy association or association ly@xmath0 absorption is presented ) . in a long enough stretch of data from any featureless spectrum",
    "there will always be several statistical fluctuations that will surpass the @xmath26 significance level .",
    "the significance of any feature with unknown wavelength is therefore not determined by the cumulative distribution @xmath27 of the excess @xmath28 ( with @xmath27 usually a gaussian ) at a given wavelength .",
    "instead it is given by the distribution @xmath29 of the maximum of @xmath30 for @xmath31 independent trials , which is @xmath32 .",
    "for a large number of trials , @xmath30 has to be very high to get a significant value of @xmath33 .",
    "the number of independent trials @xmath31 is of order of magnitude @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the length of the wavelength stretch that is being searched , and @xmath19 the instrumental full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "however , this is only an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "the precise value depends on the shape of the instrumental line spread function and the bin size of the data .    by using a monte carlo simulation",
    "we have assessed the significance of line detections for the present context .",
    "we start from a simple featureless model photon spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is binned with a bin size @xmath36 of 0.015   . for each spectral bin @xmath37 ,",
    "the deviations @xmath38 of the observed spectrum from this model spectrum are normalised to their nominal standard deviations @xmath39 such that @xmath40 has a standard normal distribution with mean @xmath41 and variance @xmath42 .",
    "given the high count rate of the spectrum , the approximation of the poissonian distribution for each bin with a gaussian as we do here is justified .",
    "all @xmath43 are statistically independent random variates .",
    "we consider 7 spectral lines , centred on @xmath44 equal to 12.1 , 13.4 , 21.6 , 22.0 , 24.8 , 28.8 and 33.7   , and generate the @xmath43 for the wavelength range between @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath46 the redshift of mrk  421 which we approximate here by 0.03 .",
    "then we do a grid search over redshift ( step size 0.0003 in @xmath47 ) and for each redshift we determine the best fit absorption line fluxes . the fluxes are simply determined from a least squares fit taking account of the exact line profile @xmath48 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : letgslsf ] ) .",
    "as we are looking for absorption lines , we put the normalisation of the line to zero whenever it becomes positive .",
    "we then calculate the difference @xmath49 in @xmath50 between the model including any absorption lines found , to the model without absorption lines . as the fit always improves by adding lines",
    ", @xmath51 is always negative . for each run",
    ", we determine the redshift with the most negative value of @xmath51 , i.e. the most significant signal for any redshift .",
    "we repeat this process @xmath52 times and determine the statistical distribution of @xmath51 by this way ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigplot ] ) .",
    "our results are almost independent of the chosen bin size @xmath36 for the spectrum ( we verified that by numerical experiments ) . in the context of ,",
    "the median and peak of the distribution are close to 10 .",
    "this corresponds to a `` @xmath53 '' detection if no account is taken of the number of trials .",
    "components with apparent significances stronger than 5.8 or 8.9@xmath9 as obtained by nme for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 systems , respectively , have probabilities of 40 and 6  % to occur by chance .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 component is not significant at all .",
    "furthermore , as we show below in the next section , the @xmath10 is not as significant as reported by nme .",
    "the two peaks at @xmath8 and @xmath10 are indeed reproduced by our new analysis of the letgs spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltachi ] ; sect .",
    "[ sect : letgsanalysis ] ) .",
    "while the peak at @xmath8 has a significance similar to the value quoted by nme , the @xmath10 component is less significant .",
    "this is mainly because we omitted the wavelength range because of the reasons mentioned earlier .",
    "note that both troughs are not very narrow ; this corresponds to the slightly different redshifts found for the lines of nme .",
    "we also took the same continuum spectrum and used it to make a simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltachi ] ) .",
    "the simulated spectrum shows three peaks of similar strength , at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . in both the fitted true spectrum of and the simulated spectrum ,",
    "the strongest peak in terms of @xmath51 is in excellent agreement with the predictions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigplot ] .",
    "we conclude that based on the chandra data alone there is not sufficient evidence for a significant detection of the whim towards mrk  421 .",
    "this does of course also imply that a true whim signal must be much stronger or more significant than the detections of nme before it can be regarded as evidence for the existence of the whim .",
    "a strong argument in favour of the existence of the @xmath8 whim component is its association with a ly@xmath0 absorption system .",
    "penton et al .",
    "@xcite found an absorption line with an equivalent width of @xmath57  m  at 1227.98   , identified as ly@xmath0 at a redshift of @xmath58 .",
    "savage et al .",
    "@xcite have studied extensively uv spectra of mrk  421 obtained by fuse and hst but they could not find any other lines neither any associated metal lines . however , savage et al . argue that this line could be hardly anything else than ly@xmath0 . at the given redshift , the system should be a cloud in a galactic void .    from our analysis of the apparent @xmath8 system ( sect .",
    "[ sect : letgsanalysis ] ) , we found as a best fit redshift @xmath59 . this is higher than the value quoted by nme because of our improved wavelength solution of the letgs .",
    "the difference of @xmath60  kms@xmath61 between this x - ray redshift and the ly@xmath0 redshift corresponds to 0.036    at the wavelength of the resonance line .",
    "this is almost equal to the spectral resolution of the letgs at that wavelength and definitely inconsistent with our current understanding of the letgs wavelength scale .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for a direct physical connection between the putative @xmath8 x - ray absorption component and the ly@xmath0 absorber .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached by savage et al .",
    "@xcite , based on the narrowness of the ly@xmath0 line which implies a low temperature and the absence of any absorption in the fuse spectra .",
    "even the evidence for a more loose association of both systems , for example in different parts of a larger filamentary structure , is not convincing : over the redshift range of @xmath62 , the probability that the most significant statistical x - ray fluctuation would occur within @xmath63 from the only known intervening ly@xmath0 system is 11.2  % .",
    "we have shown above that based on the chandra data alone there is insufficient proof for the existence of the @xmath8 and @xmath10 absorption components reported by nme . the lack of evidence does not imply automatically that these components are not present , but just that their presence can not be demonstrated using letgs data .",
    "however , if these components really would exist at the levels as reported by nme , then adding more data like our combined rgs data set should enhance the significance , but the opposite is true : the rgs spectra show no evidence at all for both absorption components .",
    "taking the weighted average of the equivalent widths of the lines obtained by all instruments , we find for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 components equivalent widths of @xmath64 and @xmath65  m , respectively ( see table  [ tab : ovii ] ) , to be compared to @xmath66 and @xmath67 as reported by nme .",
    "hence , the column densities of any component are at least two times smaller than reported by nme .",
    "the lack of evidence for both components in rgs spectra was also reported by ravasio et al .",
    "@xcite , based on a smaller subset of only 177  ks .",
    "our analysis uses 4 times more exposure time .    finally , while we were writing our paper , a preprint by williams et al .",
    "@xcite appeared .",
    "these authors use 437  ks rgs data , only half of our exposure time .",
    "they also do not find evidence for the two absorption systems , but attribute this to `` narrow instrumental features , inferior spectral resolution and fixed pattern noise in the rgs '' . as we have shown in the accompanying paper ( rasmussen et al .",
    "@xcite ) these statements lack justification when a careful analysis is done .",
    "both the rgs and the letgs spectra seem to indicate the presence of an absorption line at 22.02   , with combined equivalent width of @xmath68  m  ( table  [ tab : ovii ] ) .",
    "this feature was identified as @xmath5 absorption from , based upon the almost exact coincidence with the predicted wavelength of that line ( williams et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , as williams et al .",
    "point out , the equivalent width is about 3 times higher than the value predicted from the 2s2p doublet at 1032 and 1038   .",
    "williams et al .",
    "then offer three possible explanations for the discrepancy .",
    "the first explanation , wrong oscillator strengths of the k - shell transitions by a factor of 24 , can be simply ruled out .",
    "these strong transitions can be calculated with much higher precision .",
    "the second explanation invokes a large fraction of in an excited state .",
    "this would suppress the 2s2p uv lines relative to the 1s2p x - ray lines .",
    "apart from the fact that this situation is hard to achieve in a low density plasma ( one needs almost lte population ratio s ) , there is another important argument against this .",
    "the x - ray absorption lines from the 1s@xmath692p configuration are shifted by 0.030.05    towards longer wavelength as compared to lines from the ground state 1s@xmath692s ( a.j.j .",
    "raassen , private communication ) .",
    "thus , in this scenario the x - ray line should shift by a measurable amount towards longer wavelengths , which is not observed .",
    "the third explanation offered by williams et al . invokes intervening at @xmath70 .",
    "given the lack of other absorption lines from the same system , williams et al .",
    "argue that this is unlikely .",
    "our strongest argument against a real line is however its significance . using the known column density derived from the fuse spectra , @xmath71  m@xmath72 , savage et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we estimate that the corresponding @xmath5 1s2p line of should have an equivalent width of 0.64  m . subtracting this from the observed equivalent width ,",
    "the `` unexplained '' part has an equivalent width of @xmath73  m , i.e. a 2.5@xmath9 result .",
    "however , similar to our analysis of the chandra data , it is easy to argue that given the number of redshift trials this significance is insufficient to be evidence for redshifted .",
    "we have re - analysed carefully the chandra letgs spectra of mrk  421 , the first source for which the detection of the x - ray absorption forest has been claimed .",
    "we have supplemented this with an analysis of additional letgs observations as well as with a large sample of xmm - newton rgs observations , amounting to a total of @xmath74  ks observation time .",

    "<S> recently the first detections of highly ionised gas associated with two warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) filaments have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence is based on x - ray absorption lines due to and other ions observed by chandra towards the bright blazar mrk  421 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the robustness of this detection by a re - analysis of the original chandra letgs spectra , the analysis of a large set of xmm - newton rgs spectra of mrk  421 , and additional chandra observations . </S>",
    "<S> we address the reliability of individual spectral features belonging to the absorption components , and assess the significance of the detection of these components . </S>",
    "<S> we also use monte carlo simulations of spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the apparent strength of several features in the chandra spectra , but demonstrate that they are statistically not significant . </S>",
    "<S> this decreased significance is due to the number of redshift trials that are made and that are not taken into account in the original discovery paper . </S>",
    "<S> therefore these features must be attributed to statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by the rgs spectra , which have a higher signal to noise ratio than the chandra spectra , but do not show features at the same wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the possible association with a ly@xmath0 absorption system also lacks sufficient statistical evidence . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there is insufficient observational proof for the existence of the two proposed whim filaments towards mrk  421 , the brightest x - ray blazar on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the highly ionised component of the whim still remains to be discovered . </S>"
