    "it has recently come to light that the growth of galaxies may be less erratic than previously thought .",
    "the existence of a tight relation between the stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) of star - forming galaxies , termed the ` main sequence ' ( ms , @xcite ) is indicative of a quasi - equilibrium being maintained between gas supply , sfr , and gas expulsion from galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this sfr - m@xmath7 relation evolves strongly with look - back time , paralleling the global evolution of the cosmic sfr density from the present to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is becoming clear that such a decline in sfr is in response to diminishing gas reservoirs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency of star formation ( @xmath9 ) , i.e. , the efficiency at which gas is being converted to stars , is remarkably similar across a wide range of cosmic time within the global star - forming population , usually with gas mass @xmath10 inferred from the co molecular line luminosity @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , outliers from the ms are known to exist , with very high specific sfr ( ssfr ) compared to normal ms galaxies , such as local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg , @xcite ) . at @xmath12 ,",
    "these ms outliers represent @xmath13 of the star - forming population and contribute only a moderate fraction ( @xmath14 ) of the global co - moving sfr - density @xcite .",
    "yet , they are still likely to play an important role in galaxy evolution , as a high fraction of galaxies may experience such a star - bursting event .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the physical conditions that can lead to such a surge in sfr .",
    "local starbursts have a higher sfe compared to ms galaxies .",
    "estimates of their molecular gas content from their co luminosity indicate that a given gas mass is capable of producing higher sfrs @xcite , and a bi - modal distribution of sfes has been proposed for the general ms and outlier population @xcite . while there are uncertainties with respect to the appropriate conversion of @xmath11 to h@xmath15 gas mass ( @xmath16 ) , an offset with respect to ms galaxies is already apparent when considering the observed quantities @xmath11 and total infrared luminosity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for this enhanced sfe is not entirely clear and one can not exclude that sample selection may be responsible for the lack of galaxies with intermediate sfes . while co detections have been obtained for high - redshift submm - selected galaxies ( smgs",
    "; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and star - forming radio galaxies ( sfrg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these samples do not cleanly distinguish starburst outliers from the ms population and submm selected samples could be biased towards galaxies with lower dust temperatures @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to study the co emission of starbursts securely elevated above the ms at their respective stellar mass and near the peak epoch of star formation ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xcite achieve such a clear distinction between ms and ms - outlier galaxies using large photometric samples with multi - wavelength coverage , including the bulk of the fir emission .",
    "our targets then result in a homogenous sample that does not have contaminants such as those inherent with other selections .",
    "to address this issue , we report on interferometric observations of the molecular transition @xmath18co 2 - 1 and @xmath18co 3 - 2 for a sample of seven ms outliers using both the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and iram plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "our sample is extracted from the 246 ms outliers ( with ssfrs @xmath5 above the mean of the ms ; figure  [ fig : sample ] ) at @xmath19 identified with herschel observations over the cosmos field @xcite that effectively cover the peak fir emission . among these herschel - detected galaxies , those with photometric redshifts between 1.4 and 1.7",
    "are observed through our subaru intensive project @xcite with the fmos near - ir multi - object spectrograph .",
    "these spectra provide a detection of key diagnostic emission lines ( i.e. , h@xmath20 , h@xmath21 , [ nii]@xmath22 , [ oiii]@xmath235008 ) used to measure accurate spectroscopic redshifts , sfrs , and metallicities .",
    "six targets , labeled in figure  [ fig : sample ] , are extracted from this sample with an additional galaxy at a slightly higher redshift ( pacs-282 ; @xmath24 ) where the redshift comes from the zcosmos - deep program @xcite .",
    "our confidence in these galaxies being ` outliers ' in the sfr@xmath25 plane is based on the exquisite multi - wavelength coverage of the cosmos field .",
    "stellar masses are derived from sed - fitting using hyperz with stellar population synthesis models @xcite at the respective spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the de - blending of detections in herschel ( or 70@xmath26 _ spitzer _ ) images relies upon @xmath27 mips 24@xmath26 priors .",
    "sfrs are derived from l@xmath28 , an integral of the best - fit model sed @xcite from 8 - 1000",

    "moreover , four of the seven galaxies have 1.4 ghz radio detections at @xmath30 level @xcite and radio - based sfrs are consistent with being above the ms .",
    "the presence of strong agn within our sample is ruled out by the lack of individual x - ray detections by @xmath31 .",

    "<S> local starbursts have a higher efficiency of converting gas into stars , as compared to typical star - forming galaxies at a given stellar mass , possibly indicative of different modes of star formation . with the peak epoch of galaxy formation occurring at @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be established whether such an efficient mode of star formation is occurring at high - redshift . to address this issue </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the molecular gas content of seven high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) starburst galaxies with the atacama large ( sub-)millimeter array and iram / plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> our targets are selected from the sample of herschel far - infrared detected galaxies having star formation rates ( @xmath2300 - 800 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) elevated ( @xmath5 ) above the star - forming ` main sequence ' , and included in the fmos - cosmos near - infrared spectroscopic survey of star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 with subaru . </S>",
    "<S> we detect co emission in all cases at high levels of significance , indicative of high gas fractions ( @xmath230 - 50% ) . </S>",
    "<S> even more compelling , we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection that starbursts , identified as main - sequence outliers , at high redshift generally have a lower ratio of co to total infrared luminosity as compared to typical main - sequence star - forming galaxies , although with a smaller offset than expected based on past studies of local starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> we put forward a hypothesis that there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency with elevation from the main sequence with galaxy mergers as a possible physical driver . </S>",
    "<S> along with a heightened star formation efficiency , our high - redshift sample is similar in other respects to local starbursts such as being metal rich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium . </S>"
