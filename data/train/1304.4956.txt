    "compelling evidence has been cumulated that individual shell - type supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks accelerate charged particles , i.e. , electrons and probably ions , up to energies at least of the order of @xmath1 ev ( see e.g. cassiopeia a @xcite , rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , tycho s snr @xcite ) .",
    "charged particles are likely to be accelerated by two simultaneous mechanisms : the so - called fermi first - order , i.e. , repeated shock crossing of the particle @xcite , and drift along the shock surface @xcite . from detection of non - thermal @xmath0-ray rims",
    "@xcite , rapid time - scale variability of @xmath0-ray hot spots @xcite and @xmath2-ray emission in extended regions @xcite , a magnetic field at the shock far exceeding the theoretically predicted shock - compressed field has been inferred .",
    "the @xmath0-ray rims could be due to damping of the magnetic field @xcite rather than to synchrotron emission , although corresponding narrow filaments in the radio emission have not been observed @xcite ( see however high - resolution radio images in @xcite )",
    ". magnetic field amplification might be also relevant to _ in situ _ measurements of the plasma downstream of the solar - wind termination shock @xcite , where fluctuations have been measured of the same order as the mean , or to radio observations of mpc scale shocks at the edge of galaxy clusters @xcite . whether or not such a magnetic field amplification in snr is to be associated with energetic particles at the shock is still subject of controversy .    so far , snr observations could not rule out either of the two following mechanisms of field amplification : a ) microscopic plasma instabilities generated by cosmic - rays current flowing upstream of the shock and therein exciting non - resonant magnetic modes @xcite ; b ) macroscopic turbulent fluid motion downstream of the shock seeded by inhomogeneities of the upstream medium triggering vortical eddies and tangling the magnetic field lines hence amplifying the turbulent component @xcite ( cosmic - rays pressure gradient has also been proposed as driver of the amplification in @xcite ) .",
    "the former mechanism was also discussed in the kinetic theory approach @xcite ; however , numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) could find only a moderate amplification ( @xmath3 ) , and the unfolding of its non - linear extension and observational implications is currently active .",
    "collisionless shocks propagate in turbulent and inhomogeneous media undergoing rapid corrugation of their ideal planar surface .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the picture of a planar shock is inappropriate to describe secular evolution of downstream medium .",
    "the unshocked medium might be strongly inhomogeneous at several scales and the cold interstellar clumps strongly deform the shock surface .",
    "the passage of an oblique non - relativistic shock through inhomogeneous medium has been known for longtime to generate vorticity in the downstream flow @xcite ; in a conducting fluid the turbulent motion at scale @xmath4 with fluid velocity @xmath5 and local density @xmath6 leads to an exponentially amplified magnetic field @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "such a dynamo action amounts to a systematic conversion of the fluid kinetic energy into magnetic energy at each scale separately , possibly until equipartition is reached @xcite .",
    "recent numerical 2d - mhd simulations have shown that such an amplification can be very efficient @xcite .",
    "further numerical studies using the thermal instability of the interstellar medium ( ism ) turbulence , i.e. , condensation of the interstellar gas due to catastrophic radiative cooling @xcite , confirmed the efficient magnetic field growth ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "two - dimensional simulations of relativistic shocks @xcite show that small - scale dynamo can operate also downstream of the shocks of gamma - ray bursts outflows , suggesting that the dynamo action downstream of shocks might shed light on the energy equipartition at magnetized shocks .",
    "in this paper we provide an analytic derivation of the vorticity generated by clumpy unshocked medium , hence of the magnetic field amplification , downstream of a non - relativistic rippled collisionless shock .",
    "we apply the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions locally downstream of an mhd shock to compute the vorticity generated downstream . for the sake of simplicity , a two - dimensional shock is considered , i.e. , observables depend only upon two space coordinates .",
    "the downstream vorticity depends on the magnitude of the tangential component of the velocity ( shear ) , although a different interpretation is given here in terms of density gradient at clumps boudary , and the curvature of the shock surface as previously found for purely hydrodynamic shocks @xcite .",
    "we also compute the back - reaction to vortical motion of the seed magnetic field advected downstream , so far accounted for only numerically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the small - scale dynamo theory we determine the time - evolution of the turbulent magnetic field in the downstream fluid until saturation epoch .",
    "the encounter of a shock surface with a density clump , also called richtmyer - meshkov ( rm ) instability @xcite , has been extensively investigated in plasma laboratory experiments ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical simulations of magnetic shocks proved that rm instability drives transient events in several regions of the earth magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "recent plasma laboratory experiments @xcite made use of laser to test the magnetic field amplification by density inhomogeneities at shocks of supernova remnant ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the small - scale fluid vortices close behind the shock grow on time - scale smaller than the particle acceleration time - scale , which depends on the seed magnetic field orientation , the isotropy of the turbulent component of magnetic field and the dependence of the spatial diffusion coefficients , parallel and perpendicular , on the particle energy .",
    "therefore , the vortical field growth is unaffected by the presence of cosmic - rays at the shock . magnetic field",
    "may also be enhanced by field line stretching due to rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability @xcite at the interface between the ejecta and the interstellar medium , i.e. , far downstream of the shock .",
    "in contrast with the vortical turbulence , late - time rt turbulence might be affected by the highest energy particle gyrating in the downstream fluid far from the shock @xcite . however , rt structures are unlikely to reach out the blast wave ( @xcite and references therein ) and therefore to interact with vortical turbulence .",
    "thus the dynamo amplification local behind the shock can be temporally and spatially disentangled from the field line stretching due to rt instability .",

    "we consider the propagation of a 2d non - relativistic shock front in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "the time evolution of the two driving independent observables in ideal mhd approximation , i.e. , the fluid velocity @xmath8 and the magnetic field @xmath9 , is given , with no viscosity or heat conduction and for infinitely conductive fluid , by @xmath10   = 0 \\label{euler}\\ ] ] @xmath11 where @xmath6 , @xmath12 , are respectively density and hydrodynamic pressure of the fluid ( here @xmath13 ) . equation ( [ induction ] ) does not include any field - generating term , such as biermann battery @xcite , as the fluid on both sides of the shock is embedded in a pre - existing magnetic field .",
    "note that the current density carried by cosmic - rays is here neglected : we aim to identify the growth of the magnetic energy as generated by the vortical motion of the background fluid only .",
    "thermal dissipation reduces the energy deposited in the magnetic turbulence and will be considered in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the shock is a dynamic surface due to the interaction with the upstream clumps .",
    "the kinematics of a 2d hydrodynamic rippled shock propagating in inhomogeneous medium @xcite comprises of a sequence of unstable configurations of the shock surface .",
    "the conservation of energy requires that sections of the corrugated shock surface being ahead or lagging behind readjust to smooth - out growing corrugations .",
    "the time - evolution of the shock surface is accounted for by the rate change along the moving surface @xcite of @xmath14 , i.e. , the local angle between the average direction of the shock motion and the local normal to the shock surface ( see fig.[fig ] ) .",
    "we assume here that such a self - deformation process of the shock surface occurs on a time - scale much greater than the turn - over time of the smallest eddies in the downstream flow of the shock .",
    "thus the shock profile is `` frozen '' during the exponentially fast amplification which proceeds as the field is advected downstream .",
    "in the inviscid approximation used here the conservation of the vorticity flux applies : the vorticity shock - generated is transported along the flow `` frozen '' into the fluid , as a consequence of helmholtz - kelvin theorem .",
    "the medium upstream of the shock has zero vorticity .",
    "the vorticity is calculated downstream at a distance from the shock large enough that the shock is infinitely thin , i.e. , the thickness of the shock is much smaller than the local curvature radius at every point of the shock surface .    at a rippled shock",
    "the mhd rankine - hugoniot jump conditions can not be applied globally as the directions normal and tangential vary along the shock surface . in a 2d shock propagating at average in the direction @xmath15 ( fig.[fig ] ) , from the velocity field of the flow @xmath16 , the vorticity is given by @xmath17 and the component in the direction @xmath18 , outgoing from the paper , * by * @xmath19 ( all quantities are independent on @xmath18 and we used @xmath20 ) .",

    ", we deal with the hypothesis that the turbulent magnetic component is only generated in the downstream flow through dynamo mechanism , i.e. , the turbulence is not required on both sides of the shock as in the diffusive shock acceleration . the contribution to strong dynamo amplification in the downstream flow from far - upstream fluctuations of magnetic and flow velocity fields on several scales",
    "will be included in a forthcoming work .",
    "if the magnetic field is quasi - perpendicular to the average direction of shock motion , charged particles can be still efficiently accelerated to high - energy by the motional electric field through drifting along the shock , until they are advected in the downstream flow or escape upstream , provided they are not scattered back to the shock to further acceleration . in an oblique or quasi - parallel configuration ,",
    "if the field is amplified only in the downstream flow as described here , other upstream turbulence or pre - existing magnetic instabilities are needed to scatter energetic particles back across the shock , increase the residence time in the upstream region and release larger energy accelerated particles . since no upstream magnetic turbulence is included here , at the present stage this model reconciles dynamo amplification with particle acceleration occurring in the same region of the shock only for quasi - perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "turbulence of upstream medium allows an extension to oblique and quasi - parallel cases .",
    "we consider a seed - magnetic field upstream uniform and normal to the average direction of motion ( @xmath41 , or @xmath42 and @xmath43 , see fig.[fig ] ) .",
    "for the first term in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ deltaomega2 ] ) , we can write @xmath44 , as @xmath45 . the last term in eq.([deltaomega2 ] ) vanishes : @xmath46 = 0 $ ] and @xmath47 .    assuming that amplification is efficient at the smallest scales ( see sect .",
    "[ sect_amplif_field ] ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are drowned out by the turbulent components : @xmath50 and @xmath51 for a perpendicular field ( see also last paragraph in the present section ) .",
    "therefore the factors @xmath52 and @xmath48 in eq.([deltaomega2 ] ) include both the impulsive shock compression and the turbulence amplification .",
    "we can conclude that the vorticity produced downstream of a 2d shock propagating in an inhomogeneous medium with a uniform perpendicular upstream magnetic field ( same as for parallel shock as shown later ) can be recast , neglecting obliqueness , in a simple form : @xmath53   -   \\frac{b_n \\delta b_s}{4\\pi \\rho c_r } \\partial_s \\vartheta , \\label{dom_perp}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the jump across the shock of the magnetic field in the direction locally tangential to the shock surface including the rankine - hugoniot compressed seed field and the turbulently amplified field and @xmath48 is the component in the direction locally normal to the shock surface including the unchanged rankine - hugoniot and the turbulent component .",
    "the factor @xmath54 shows the dependence of @xmath55 on the shock compression . the first term in eq.([dom_perp ] )",
    "contains the density gradient ( @xmath56 ) , hence having the role of the baroclinic generation of vorticity , i.e. , the term @xmath57 appearing in the equation for @xmath58 time - evolution : when an upstream clump ( clump size is assumed greater than shock thickness ) crosses the shock the clump is locally heated with a maximum compression at the front of the cloud and smaller along the side of the cloud , whereas the density gradient is directed across the fluid - clump interface @xcite : thus , the gradients of density and pressure are no longer parallel and vorticity is generated in the transition layer ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the thermal instability model for ism predicts a broad range @xcite for the transition layer between the cloud and the ism shocked gas as a function of the thermal conduction ( see sect .",
    "[ sect_discuss ] ) .",
    "the second , or corrugation , term in eq.([dom_perp ] ) results from the finite curvature radius of the shock , i.e. , for a planar shock @xmath60 at every point of the shock surface . as shown in the following section , the purely hydrodynamic terms ( baroclinic and corrugation ) drive the small - scale magnetic field growth .",
    "the back - reaction of the small - scale turbulent field is represented by the last term : vortical eddies shear and whirl field lines around enhancing the turbulent field as long as the entailed magnetic tension grows to strength large enough to halt such a growth .",
    "similar dependence of the field back - reaction on the turbulent - field alfvn speed can also be reasonably derived by dimensional arguments @xcite but it follows here from the application of local rankine - hugoniot jump conditions at rippled shocks .",
    "note that in the absence of shock ripples , i.e. , for infinitely large local curvature radius , the term @xmath61 and back - reaction of the amplified field on the vorticity becomes negligible . also , the vorticity downstream of a shock wave in eq.([dom_perp ] ) holds regardless the speed of the shock wave ( alfvn , fast or slow magnetosonic speed ) .",
    "we recall that in contrast with 3d turbulence , the shear of the fluid velocity along the vorticity , i.e. , @xmath62 , vanishes in a 2d flow and the vorticity generation in a 2d fluid might be under - estimated .",
    "note that if the magnetic field upstream is uniform and parallel to the average direction of motion ( @xmath63 , or @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , the magnetic term in eq.([dom_perp ] ) is unchanged . therefore , assuming efficient turbulent field amplification , a difference in the growth of @xmath66 , i.e. , in the saturated turbulent field , is not expected between the perpendicular and parallel field upstream cases , confirming previous numerical findings @xcite ( see also sect .",
    "[ sect_amplif_field ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the turbulent field isotropically becomes much greater than @xmath67 , regardless the orientation of the seed - field upstream .",
    "as a result of dynamo action @xcite , the growth of a turbulent magnetic field is known to be governed by the fluid vorticity at each scale .",
    "the unperturbed field is initially too weak to affect the fluid velocity field and the turbulent field grows exponentially fast , i.e. , on the time scale of the smallest eddies turnover time @xcite , until the magnetic energy produces non - negligible effects on the velocity field and then saturates .",
    "the time - evolution of the total magnetic field ( eq.[induction ] ) , i.e. , both ordered and turbulent components , is determined here by using the small - scale dynamo theory @xcite .",
    "the vortical swirling exponentially amplifies also the mean field .",
    "however , since the amplification time - scale is of the order of the smallest eddies turnover time , the saturation occurs much faster at small - scale .",
    "no statistical assumption is made on the magnetic field , in contrast with the usual numerical approach .",
    "this is a relevant simplification as the spatial diffusion of charged particles in a turbulence depends on the magnetic power spectrum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the small - scale dynamo theory predicts that the turbulent field obeys an unbounded exponential amplification at a rate @xmath68 @xcite : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the total magnetic energy per unit of mass , including seed and turbulent fields .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the isotropy and homogeneity of the velocity correlation entails the following simple relation between the amplification rate of @xmath71 and the vorticity generated downstream of the shock : @xmath72 .",
    "however , such a version of the dynamo theory can not resolve the dilemma posed by the unlimited magnetic growth and several non - linear versions have been elaborated @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper the back - reaction of the field to the vorticity growth and the saturation of @xmath73 at realistic rippled shocks .",
    "we argue that eq.([dom_perp ] ) for @xmath74 allows to explore the regime of self - controlled growth wherein the turbulent field becomes so strong to affect the velocity field . the time - evolution of the turbulence amplification until the saturation epoch can be determined : if we recast eq.([dom_perp ] ) as @xmath75 , then @xmath71 satisfies @xmath76 where @xmath77 $ ] is the local growth rate of @xmath71 and @xmath78 is the local back - reaction ; the initial condition for eq .",

    "we note that the ism clump size is much larger than the shock thickness and the shock crossing is not impulsive on the vorticity generation time - scale ; thus , @xmath71 in the bracket of eq.([epsiloneq ] ) is continuously generated during the shock crossing and is not constant in time .    neglecting the time dependence of @xmath82 ( the magnetic modes grow slowly for initially weak field @xcite ) ,",
    "the solution is readily found : @xmath83 for a uniform average interstellar matter density .",
    "equation ( [ exact ] ) provides the first analytic time - evolution of a self - controlled amplification of magnetic energy through fluid vortical motion generated downstream of a 2d rippled shock .",
    "for @xmath84 the term proportional to @xmath85 in the denominator is negligible and @xmath73 grows exponentially ( @xmath86 ) . for times",
    "@xmath87 the term proportional to @xmath85 dominates over the first term and the saturation is attained : @xmath88 corresponding to an increase @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the seed - field alfvn mach number ( see sect .",

    "the measured downstream turbulence is rarely amplified to values much greater than the mean field @xcite , and the term @xmath94 is no longer negligible with respect to @xmath91 and a different analysis is needed .",
    "whether the magnetic field is amplified by waves excitation in the shock precursor or downstream through the coupling of the eddies motion with the magnetic field lines , or a synergy of the two mechanisms , or other processes , is not observationally settled yet .",
    "only the former has been largely explored in recent years .",
    "this paper presents for the first time an analytic approach to the latter mechanism .    in what follows we estimate @xmath82 and @xmath95 showing that eq.([exact ] )",
    "applies to the time - evolution of magnetic energy in young and middle - aged snrs .",
    "we do not aim here at predicting a typical length - scale of the @xmath0-ray rims due to the large variety of snrs taxonomy , but rather we show that reasonable values of the clump / fluid transition layer , shock curvature radius and shock speed are capable to produce the inferred efficient magnetic field amplification .",

    "thermal instability model of two - phase fluid suggests that such a thickness is given by the field length @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath115 depends on the heat conduction @xcite and is thus uncertain as the thermal conductivity might be sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "the previous history of formation and evolution of the supernova progenitor might also affect the properties of the surrounding medium , i.e. , uniform or stellar wind density profile .",

    "thus , the field amplification saturates faster in a region of smaller @xmath115 providing a constraint testable by multiwavelength observations .",
    "this justifies the description in sect.[sect_vorticity ] that the vorticity , and the strong turbulent field , are generated in the transition layer separating the cold clump from warm ism and does not depend on the clump size .",

    "as the magnetic field strengthens , it reacts to field lines whirling halting the turbulence growth . in more general terms , as the field increases by dynamo effect it also releases its tension by unwinding at a rate of order of alfvn speed : the backreaction grows with the turbulent field alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "the local back - reaction of the field @xmath131 can be estimated by @xmath132 clearly @xmath95 is enhanced by small curvature radius ( @xmath133 ) as the more corrugated is the shock , the shorter the eddies turnover time , the more efficiently the turbulent field is created downstream and back - reacts to fluid motion . from eq.([epsiloneq ] ) , it is clear that as @xmath71 increases , the back - reaction term grows faster than the driving term , eventually becoming dominant : the strongest field has the smallest growth ( cfr .",

    "the field growth is clearly more efficient at the small scale @xmath115 , as also shown in fig.[lf ] . in fig.[rc ] an increase in @xmath118 reduces the field back - reaction ( @xmath133 ) resulting in a larger saturation value .",

    "if the turbulent fluid velocity downstream of the shock follows a 1d kolmogorov power spectrum at a certain scale @xmath168 as numerical simulations seem to suggest @xcite ( @xmath169 ) , the vorticity spectrum at scale @xmath170 is given by @xmath171 : in the inertial range the vortical energy at small - scale is greater than at large scale . also , since the field at small - scale grows and saturates faster , at that scale the magnetic energy coincides with the turbulent energy @xcite .",
    "we indicate here such a scale to be @xmath172 pc",
    ". however , as a result of the uncertainties on the field length @xmath115 @xcite , within the scenario presented here a unique length - scale of magnetic growth can not be identified .",
    "a range of scales consistent with the ism fluctuations is shown here to account for optical and @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "the confirmation will be sought through kinetic analysis or 3d numerical simulations in forthcoming publications .",
    "an attractive feature of the microinstabilities mechanism in @xcite is that magnetic field growth is associated with energetic particles at the shock and the field saturation is driven by the cosmic - rays of highest energy , possibly @xmath173 ev protons .",
    "in contrast , the lack of direct association between particle acceleration and field amplification in the dynamo mechanism here does not disfavor it as an interpretation of the @xmath0-ray rims in snrs : the particle acceleration might proceed through the motional electric field @xmath174 along the rippled shock surface ( such an acceleration is known to be faster than in the parallel field case @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the scale of the smallest eddies , or highest turbulent field , inferred here ( @xmath175 cm ) is comparable to the gyroscale @xmath176 of energetic protons with energy @xmath177 ev in a field @xmath178 g ( @xmath179 cm ) ; hence , the mean free path @xmath180 of the highest energy particles , except the bohm scattering case , i.e. , @xmath181 , is typically greater than @xmath115 .",

    ", we have derived the temporal evolution and the saturation of the turbulent magnetic field downstream of the shock , including the non - linear field back - reaction .",
    "we conclude that the saturation of @xmath73 by small - scale dynamo action depends on the shock speed , on the thickness of the layer of the ism clumps and on the shock curvature radius .",
    "the saturation value is found counter - intuitively not to depend on the size of the ism clumps , as also found for purely hydrodynamic shocks @xcite .",
    "perpendicular and parallel field upstream cases lead to the same saturation values , if amplification is very strong , due to fast isotropization of the downstream turbulence .",
    "our finding shows that small - scale dynamo might explain non - thermal @xmath0-ray and optical observations of young / middle - aged supernova remnant shocks .",
