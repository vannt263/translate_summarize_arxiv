    "it is now several decades since the ground - breaking work by werner and his co - workers showed that gravitational @xcite and rotational @xcite effects were to be found in neutron interference experiments performed on the earth s",
    "surface @xcite .",
    "the predicted and experimentally confirmed gravitational phase shift is the only expression in physics to feature both newton s constant of gravitation @xmath0 and planck s quantum of action @xmath1 , which surely makes these experiments particularly noteworthy .",
    "the two experiments are referred to hereafter as the cow experiment and the neutron sagnac effect .",
    "straightforward , semi - classical derivations of these effects have already appeared in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) and in abbreviated form are summarized in sections [ sec : simplecow ] and [ sec : simplesagnac ] below .",
    "what is very clear , however , is that a proper account of this topic should really be sought in general relativity ( gr )  which is , after all , a theory of gravity !  and indeed numerous papers have been written using this approach ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "some of these explore rather sophisticated notions , for example a possible parallel between the cow experiment and the aharonov - bohm effect , based on the integrated curvature of an enclosed path , on the one hand in parameter space and on the other hand in field space @xcite . we do not aim to explore these higher - flown topics , but rather to present a simple demonstration of how gr can account for the findings in neutron interferometry , and , at an introductory level suitable for instance for inclusion in an introductory course , demonstrate that general relativity has an application in quantum physics @xcite",
    " a notion which might still cause some surprise !",
    "we use the kerr solution of gr @xcite , since this includes the rotation of the earth through the angular momentum parameter @xmath2 , as well as @xmath3 , the angular velocity of the earth , and @xmath4 its schwarzschild radius .",
    "these are all small parameters , and we calculate the relevant effects to second order in all these quantities ( mixed and unmixed ) .",
    "the general method of procedure is the weak field approximation , adopted by stodolsky @xcite .",
    "the next section describes a standard , elementary derivation of the cow effect , and in section [ sec : simplesagnac ] is a similarly elementary derivation of the sagnac effect for neutrons . in section",
    "[ sec : kerr_metric ] the general relativistic setting for more realistic derivations of these effects is presented .",
    "the kerr metric is displayed as well as a coordinate transformation to a cartesian system relevant to our problem . in the final section",
    "our results are derived .",
    "use is made of the weak field approximation in conjunction with a specific assumption which allows the calculations to be preformed .",
    "it is found that the resulting phase shifts are , in both cases , those predicted by the simple models in sections [ sec : simplecow ] and [ sec : simplesagnac ] , with correction factors of @xmath5 , and additional small terms involving @xmath3 , the angular velocity of the earth .",
    "the setup described in reference @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is based on the splitting of the neutron beam by bragg diffraction from perfect crystals , as first implemented for x rays by bonse and hart @xcite .",
    "rauch and werner @xcite point out that when the desired degree of crystal cutting is achieved , the resulting interferometry `` exhibits the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in a very direct and obvious way '' .",
    "the interference involved is `` topologically equivalent to a ring '' , which we represent as a rectangle , of macroscopic dimensions ( centimetres ) .",
    "the neutrons enter at the bottom left corner where the beam splits into two , and the beams recombine at the top right corner , where the interference takes place .",
    "the spatial part of a plane matter wave describing a neutron beam is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wave vector and @xmath8 is the wave number , with @xmath9 being the de broglie wavelength , so the phase accumulated over a path from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is @xmath12 or , since @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is particle s momentum , @xmath15 this refers to a particular _ path _ , so the phase difference between neutron beams along two distinct paths is @xmath16 in our case the path i is the lower route and path ii the upper route .",
    "the contributions to @xmath17 from the vertical parts of these two routes cancel , since the relevant momenta are equal and opposite ; and putting @xmath18 and @xmath19 along the horizontal lower and upper routes respectively ( with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the corresponding particle speeds ) , we find @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the length of the interferometer .",
    "conservation of energy now gives us @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath26 the height of the interferometer .",
    "since @xmath27 is of the order of @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 for thermal neutrons , then @xmath32 , and @xmath33 giving finally @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the area of the interferometer .",
    "this phase shift was first predicted and observed in 1975 by colella , overhauser and werner @xcite .",
    "it is pertinent to note that the above expression for the phase shift may alternatively be obtained by starting from a lagrangian @xmath36 given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) then yields the expected result ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the experiment , first performed by werner , staudenmann and colella @xcite , measured the effect of the earth s rotation on the neutron phase . to take account of a rotating frame the lagrangian ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    "should be modified to @xmath41 where @xmath3 is the angular velocity of the frame and @xmath42 the angular momentum of the particle .",
    "then the momentum ( [ eq:7 ] ) becomes @xmath43 the phase coming from the term in @xmath3 is @xmath44\\cdot d{{\\bf r } }   = \\frac{2 m \\bm{\\omega \\cdot { a}}}{\\hbar},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is again the area of the interferometer .",
    "this sagnac phase is typically of the order of @xmath46 of the gravitational cow phase , so to detect it means setting up the apparatus in such a way that the cow contribution to the phase is zero .",
    "this is achieved by having the interferometer in a vertical plane  say in the @xmath47 or @xmath48 plane  and then rotating it about a vertical axis .",
    "the observations of the phase shift of the neutron due to the earth s rotation were found to be in good agreement with the theory @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a general relativistic derivation of the cow and neutron sagnac effects . to describe the gravitational field of the rotating earth , we first write down the kerr metric @xcite in its standard boyer - lindquist form @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angular momentum parameter , @xmath51 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath52 is the mass , and @xmath53 is the radius of the earth .",
    "this metric describes the rotating earth as seen from an inertial frame .",
    "the experiments we are considering , however , take place on the earth , and therefore in a rotating frame , so to find the appropriate metric we must replace @xmath54 by @xmath55 given by = ",
