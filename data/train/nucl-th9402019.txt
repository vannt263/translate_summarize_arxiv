    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to be the correct theory of the strong interactions .",
    "still , the description of hadrons in terms of the underlying degrees of freedom of the theory , namely , quarks and gluons , remains a daunting task .",
    "although fundamental approaches such as lattice gauge theory continue to improve , it is unrealistic to forsee lattice calculations of the hadronic spectrum in the immediate future .",
    "yet , it may still be fruitful to use lattice qcd to determine properties and parameters of a phenomenological model .",
    "nonrelativistic quark models have been quite successful in this regard .",
    "for example , quarkonium , the bound - state spectrum of a quark - antiquark system , is well reproduced by a phenomenological potential consisting of the sum of a one - gluon exchange component and a confinement contribution .",
    "the quantitative description of meson masses , their static properties and decay rates count among the many successes of the model .",
    "lattice simulations have provided conclusive evidence that qcd is a confining theory . for large quark - antiquark @xmath0 separations ,",
    "lattice qcd predicts a linearly rising potential between heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "however , heavy - quark systems place the strongest constraints on the short - distance part of the @xmath1 interaction and , thus , remain fairly insensitive to the details of the confinement potential .",
    "thus , it is safe to conclude that the nonrelativistic quark model reveals little about the nature of quark confinement in the region where the model is expected to be valid .",
    "the light - quark spectrum is sensitive to the long - range part of the potential but the assumptions of the model are questionable in this case .",
    "many attempts have been made to incorporate relativistic corrections into the nonrelativistic quark model  @xcite . for the most part these",
    "have consisted of a relativistic dispersion relation together with relativistic ( @xmath2 ) corrections to the nonrelativistic potential .",
    "it is essential to stress , however , that these dynamical corrections can only be effected after the lorentz structure of the potential has been established . at present , very little is known about the dynamical origin of the confinement potential and even less about its lorentz transformation properties .",
    "understanding the lorentz character of the confinement potential  by means of a stability analysis of the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation  is the main focus of the present work .    the starting point for most relativistic studies of the meson spectrum",
    "is the covariant bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are difficulties associated with using the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for bound states .",
    "chief among these is the appearance of a relative - time variable due to retardation effects .",
    "three - dimensional reductions of the full bse , which eliminate the relative - time variable , abound .",
    "while most of these reductions attempt to preserve fundamental physical principles , there is still no method of choice . here , we work within the framework of salpeter s instantaneous approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the use of an instantaneous approximation is an appealing choice for the study of the lorentz structure of the confinement potential .",
    "we recognize that , because very little is known about the dynamical origin of the confinement potential , introducing non - instantaneous corrections into the formalism is highly model dependent .",
    "we do not pretend to make any contribution to this subject .",
    "instead , we simply adopt the position that if an ad - hoc modelling of retardation must be done , ignoring it altogether is probably the best choice .",
    "still , we recognize that a choice for the lorentz structure of the potential must be made before it can be incorporated into a relativistic equation .",
    "we should also mention that because the long - range part of the potential is the main focus of the present work , the short - range , one - gluon exchange ( oge ) component will be ignored .",
    "if , instead , the goal becomes the realistic description of the meson spectrum , one would be forced to include the oge piece .",
    "note that since the oge contribution has a clear dynamical origin , incorporating retardation effects now becomes important and largely model independent . in this case",
    ", the use of an instantaneous approximation might be harder to justify .",
    "the lorentz structure of the confinement potential is usually assumed to be scalar  @xcite . yet",
    ", several authors have suggested that the hypothesis of scalar confinement is not correct .",
    "lage  @xcite , and independently , gara , durand , and durand  @xcite examined several models within the framework of the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation and concluded that the confining potential was not a scalar .",
    "archvadze , chachkhunashvili , and kopaleishvili examined the light - mass spectrum and concluded that no stable solutions exist for scalar confinement  @xcite .",
    "more recently , mnz , resag , metsch , and petry found that reliable solutions of salpeter s equation for scalar confinement exist only for large quark masses and weak confinement strength  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a stability analysis of salpeter s equation in the pseudoscalar channel assuming , both , scalar and timelike lorentz structures for the confinement potential .",
    "the stability analysis stems from the recognition that salpeter s equation is identical in structure to a random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) equation familiar from the study of nuclear collective excitations .",
    "this stability analysis reveals the existence of imaginary eigenvalues for the case of scalar confinement .",
    "moreover , an analytic study suggests that the instability should persist even in the case of a very large constituent mass .",
    "in contrast , no instability is observed for timelike confinement .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secformal ] we review some general properties of the instantaneous approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "special emphasis is placed on the rpa structure of the equation .",
    "it is in this context that we make contact with previous stability analyses of the nuclear many - body problem . in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] we discuss our method of solution and present results for the mass spectrum of pseudoscalar states for a variety of quark masses .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ secconcl ] contains our conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "here , we briefly outline a derivation of salpeter s equation , using greens s function methods , for a fermion - antifermion pair of equal mass ( the extension to different masses is straightforward ) .",
    "in addition , we show the equivalence of salpeter s equation to an rpa equation .",
    "the starting point for our derivation is the four - point green s function , or two - body propagator , defined by @xmath3    | { \\psi_0 } \\rangle \\ ; , \\label{prop}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are fermion fields in the heisenberg representation , @xmath5 are dirac spinor indices , and @xmath6 represents the exact vacuum wave function .",
    "the four point function describes the propagation of two fermions @xmath7 , or a fermion - antifermion ( @xmath8 ) pair , and contains all scattering and bound - state information . restricting the relative time variables in the green s function ,",
    "enables one to select out , either , @xmath9 or @xmath8 modes from the propagator .",
    "the two - body propagator , and ultimately the bound - state spectrum , will be generated as a solution to the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation .",
    "this is the central assumption of the model .",
    "thus , in this approximation the irreducible kernel is given by @xmath10 in salpeter s instantaneous approximation there are two remaining time variables ( and , thus , one remaining relative time variable ) . by selecting them according to @xmath11 one isolates the propagation of the @xmath8 , as opposed to the @xmath9 , mode . in this limit ,",
    "salpeter s equation for the two - body propagator becomes , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the free two - body propagator and @xmath14 is the energy variable conjugate to @xmath15 .",
    "a study of the analytic structure of @xmath16 , by means of a lehmann representation , reveals that the propagator contains singularities at the position of the bound - state poles .",
    "salpeter s equation can then be obtained by picking up the residue at the bound - state pole @xmath17 where the salpeter amplitude has been defined by @xmath18 to interpret @xmath19 , we expand the fermion fields in terms of a free single - particle basis : @xmath20}_\\alpha      b_{s}({\\bf k } ) +      { \\left[v_{{\\bf k}s}({\\bf x})\\right]}_\\alpha      { d}^{\\dagger}_{s}({\\bf k } )    \\big)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are second - quantized operators , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are free single - particle dirac spinors ( see appendix  [ singpart ] ) . in this representation ,",

    "we have indicated with `` pluses '' the results obtained by assuming a confinement potential having a timelike lorentz structure . in this case",
    ", the development of a well - defined plateau signals the stability of the solution .",
    "in contrast , the presence of an instability in the scalar case ( shown with `` diamonds '' ) is manifested by the appearance of imaginary eigenvalues ( @xmath97 )  even after including only five basis states .",
    "the presence of imaginary eigenvalues is only one of many possible manifestations of an instability . in particular , at the onset of the instability ( i.e. , for @xmath98 ) the solution is also characterized by having @xmath99 and , thus , zero norm . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have plotted the two ( reduced ) pseudoscalar amplitudes @xmath100 and @xmath101 as a function of the relative separation between the quarks using @xmath102  gev . this represents a value of the oscillator parameter for which the energy is about to become imaginary . the approximate validity of the @xmath103 relation is evident . in addition , the behavior of both amplitudes , as well as the relative importance of the different basis states , suggests that the solution is , indeed , mixing in basis states having large momentum components .",
    "this result is in striking contrast with the one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for timelike confinement . not only do both amplitudes display a very smooth behavior with @xmath104 , but , from the relative size of the amplitudes we can conclude that the relativistic corrections are small down to values of the quark mass of @xmath95  mev .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6],[fig7 ] , and [ fig8 ] we have carried out the same analysis as above but for a larger value of the constituent mass , i.e. , @xmath105  mev . the main purpose of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is to indicate how easily one can be mislead into believing that the solution for scalar confinement is stable . limiting the calculation to 5 or 15 basis states results in a smooth and stable behavior for the energy . yet , as soon as basis states having large - enough momentum components are mixed in , the instability becomes manifest .",
    "the striking difference displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the behavior of the amplitudes as a function of the number of basis states , serves to further reinforce our conclusion .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the stability of the timelike solution against an increase in the number of basis states .",
    "we have investigated the lorentz structure of the confinement potential by means of a stability analysis of the meson spectra using salpeter s instantaneous approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation . because the algebraic structure of salpeter s equation is identical in form to an rpa equation",
    ", we benefited from the techniques developed by thouless in his study of nuclear collective excitations .",
    "the analysis revealed an instability , manifested by the appearance of imaginary eigenvalues , for a confinement potential assumed to transform as a lorentz scalar .",
    "moreover , an analytic study suggests that this instability will persist even for large values of the constituent mass  provided one can mix in large - enough momentum components .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that if , instead , the calculation is limited to a small number of basis states , one can conclude  erroneously  that the stability will get restored for large - enough values of the quark mass .",
    "in essence , we have shown that for momentum components larger than the constituent mass , relativistic effects modify the singularity structure of the potential and give rise , effectively , to a negative string tension .",
    "in contrast to the scalar case , we have found no instability for timelike confinement .",
    "furthermore , a study of the lowest mass pseudoscalar state suggests small relativistic corrections down to values of the quark mass of @xmath95  mev .",
    "many issues remain to be addressed .",
    "for example , how sensitive are our results to the choice of an instantaneous approximation .",
    "the answer to this question is difficult because very little , if at all , is known about the dynamical origin of the confinement potential .",
    "thus , throughout this work we have adopted the same static form for the confining potential revealed to us from lattice gauge studies .",
    "still , the role of non - instantaneous contributions , such as retardation , remains an important open problem .",
    "a natural extension of this work could consist of a detailed study of the meson spectra using a two - body interaction having a timelike confining piece plus a one - gluon - exchange contribution .",
    "this lorentz choice for the confinement is dictated , not only by the previous stability analysis , but , also , by the correct reproduction of the linear regge trajectories  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a timelike confinement potential leads to a relativistic spin - orbit contribution of the `` wrong '' sign  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sign of the spin - orbit splitting seems to constitute our best evidence in support of scalar confinement  @xcite .",
    "one could attempt to remedy this deficiency by introducing a mixture of scalar plus timelike confinement  @xcite or some other imaginative solution  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the final outcome , it should be evident that the long - range part of the @xmath106 interaction will remain at the center of many future investigations .",
