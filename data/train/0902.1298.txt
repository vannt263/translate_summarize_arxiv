    ", the explanation of the dhva oscillation can be given with the help of the filling factor @xmath138=@xmath139 , which measures the number of occupied ll s and is an integer when all the available states in the @xmath138 lowest landau levels are filled . at",
    "these integer values the 2deg is incompressible and the chemical potential jumps discontinuously between two adjacent ll s by an amount of @xmath140=@xmath141=@xmath142 ( @xmath8=@xmath143 ) , which defines the incompressibility gap .",
    "note that the abrupt jump in the dhva oscillation is on the high magnetic field side of the sawtooth , which is special for our present choice of the thermodynamic system .",
    "if the system is constrained to have constant chemical potential , then the jump in the dhva oscillation will move to the low magnetic field side of the sawtooth , which has been confirmed by meinel _",
    "et al_. @xcite in an experiment with the electron density @xmath144  modulated by applying a gate voltage to the sample .",
    "the zero - temperature behavior of the magnetization curve can be seen by eq .",
    "( [ e2e ] ) , which in the absence of edge states is@xmath145 from above equation , one can easily derive a simplified maxwell relation @xmath146=@xmath147 .",
    "thus the discontinuous jump @xmath148 is related to the discontinuity in the chemical potential @xmath149 , i.e. , the landau energy gap at even and the zeeman gap at odd filling factors , according to @xmath150 . when the magnetic field increases within an odd filling factor @xmath138 , the fermi energy @xmath129 and ll s also increase with @xmath2 . as a result , the magnetization also increases rapidly as a function of @xmath2 , then evolves a maximum at adjacent filling factor @xmath151 and suddenly jumps to a negative value .",
    "the zero - temperature magnetization jump at these even filling factors are given by the above maxwell relation , @xmath148=@xmath152 , independent of the magnetic field and spin - splitting .",
    "at finite temperature as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( @xmath109=@xmath153 k ) , the oscillation amplitude of the magnetization increases with increasing the magnetic field .",
    "this fact is due to that the influence of finite temperature in this case ( i.e. , no soi and no edge states in the 2deg ) is merely to reduce the oscillation amplitude and the discontinuities in @xmath1 and @xmath110 via the smearing of the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "another fact revealed in fig .",
    "2 is that the inclusion of the zeeman splitting in the ll s does not change the dhva oscillation modes of the physical quantities .",
    "it is due to this fact that the ll s are usually treated to be spin degenerate in previous work .     in units of @xmath8 in the sample with edges as a function of the external magnetic field @xmath2 .",

    "( b ) the ratio of edge states contribution of magnetization to the total magnetization . @xmath105 nm . ]    now let us see the edge - state effects on the magnetization .",
    "3 shows the influence of the edge states on the oscillations of chemical potential and magnetization ( dhva oscillations ) with magnetic field .",
    "the most prominent feature brought by the edge states is that the center of the dhva oscillations is now dependent on the magnetic field . in particular , for the field less than @xmath7 tesla , the oscillatory magnetization is always positive in sign .",
    "another feature shown in fig .",
    "4 is that the oscillation amplitude decreases with decreasing the sample size .",
    "as is known , the origin of dhva oscillations is the degeneracy of landau levels .",
    "the edge states with dispersion lead to edge current which not only is crucial for the quantum hall effects , but also very important for the magnetization @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the edge states partially lift the degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "thus the edge states tend to destroy the dhva oscillations .",
    "therefore it leads to the decreasing of oscillation amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "4 . the upshift of the center of dhva oscillations may be understood in the following way .",
    "for the effects from the edge states , what really matters is the ratio of two important length scales : the magnetic length @xmath32 and the system size @xmath17 .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath17 is equivalent to the increasing of @xmath32 , i.e. , decreasing of @xmath2 or @xmath38 . as seen in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , in the case with smaller @xmath17 or weaker @xmath2 , the second term becomes less important and the eigenenergy is less sensitive to the magnetic field for states with @xmath62 near the edges . from eq .",
    "( [ e2e ] ) , one sees that the second term overcomes the first term and leads to the upshift of the center of dhva oscillations .",
    "the smaller the system size is , the more profound effects the edge states lead to , as seen in fig . 4 for both the center and amplitude of the dhva oscillations .",
    "5(a ) shows quantitatively the system size dependence of the shift of the oscillation center .",
    "it has the dependence @xmath156 . roughly , the contribution of the edge states is proportional to the number of edge states ( as also seen from eq.([e2e ] ) ) , which is proportional to @xmath157 , where the cyclotron radius @xmath158 @xcite , with the number of the occupied landau levels @xmath159 .",
    "thus the center of dhva oscillations is proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath17 dependence is clearly seen in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "to see more explicitly the contribution from edge states and bulk states , we plot the total magnetization and the contribution from bulk states in fig .",
    "the contribution from the edge states is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e2d ] ) by summing over terms from edge states , with @xmath161 or @xmath162 .",
    "the rest contribution is from bulk states .",
    "there is no upshift of the magnetization oscillation center for the part from bulk states .",
    "it shows explicitly that the upshift of the center of dhva oscillations is due to the existence of edge states .",
    "6(b ) shows the dependence of edge states contribution on the magnetic field .",
    "the contribution from edge states increases as decreasing the magnetic field , or equivalently decreasing the sample size as one expects .    when the rashba soi is introduced , the filling factor @xmath138 is not linearly proportional to the inverse of the external field @xmath2 , and there is a energy competition between the zeeman coupling and the rashba coupling . also , due to the entanglement between the orbital and spin degrees of freedom , it is difficult to distinguish their separate contributions to the total magnetization .",
    "these factors make the physical picture of the dhva oscillations to change fundamentally , as shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) for chemical potential @xmath1 and fig .",
    "7(b ) for magnetization @xmath110 as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "one can see from these two figures that the rashba soi has no visible influence on the magnetic oscillations of the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath110 at large values of @xmath2 , where the zeeman and spin - orbit coupling splitting are small compared to the landau level splitting . at low magnetic field , however , the soi modulation of the magnetic oscillations becomes obvious , which can be clearly seen by the enlarged plots of @xmath1 and @xmath110 in fig .",
    "7(c ) and 7(d ) respectively for @xmath2 less than @xmath163 t. for comparison , we also re - plot in figs .",
    "7(c)-(d ) the cases without rashba soi .",
    "one can see from these two figures that the soi brings about two new features at low magnetic field : ( i ) the sawtooth structure is inversed , i.e. , the location of peaks in @xmath1 and @xmath110 with soi correspond to the valleys without soi .",
    "this inversion is due to the different ll s in the two cases .",
    "( ii ) the oscillation mode is prominently modulated by soi and a beating pattern appears .",
    "this beating behavior in the oscillations are due to the fact that the ll s @xmath84 and @xmath164 are now unequally spaced due to the presence of soi .     and ( b ) the magnetization @xmath92 ( per electron ) for the 2deg under different temperatures @xmath165k and @xmath7k with rasha spin - orbit interaction in the absence of edge states .",
    "the rashba coupling is taken to be @xmath26=@xmath166 mev nm .",
    "the other parameters are same as those in fig .",
    "the detailed oscillations of @xmath1 and @xmath92 at low magnetic fields are illustrated in ( c ) and ( d ) respectively ( solid lines ) , in comparison with the case of @xmath26=@xmath16 ( dotted lines ) . ]",

    "the sample size @xmath105 nm . the temperature @xmath165 k. ]    another effect caused by the rashba spin - orbit coupling is that there are weak peaks appearing in the chemical potential and the magnetization oscillation at low magnetic field , as shown with the arrows in fig .",
    "7 . in the 2deg sample without edges , the weak peaks will appear in the magnetization once the temperature is sufficient low , for example , @xmath109=@xmath7k .",
    "these weak peaks have been observed recently by schaapman et al.@xcite when they measured the magnetization of a dual - subband 2deg , confined in a gaas / algaas heterojection , and by zhu et al.@xcite when they measured the magnetization of high - mobility 2deg .",
    "these peaks is so weak that they will disappear when the temperature is much higher .",
    "now let us see the soi effect superposed on the edge - state effect .",
    "figures 8(a)-(b ) show the chemical potential @xmath1 and magnetization @xmath110 respectively in the presence of both soi  and edge states .",
    "one can see from these two figures that at large values of @xmath2 , where the zeeman and spin - orbit coupling splitting are small compared to the landau level splitting , and thus the rashba soi has no big influence on the magnetic oscillations of the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath110 .",
    "neither do the edge states , since the cyclotron radius is much smaller than the system size . at low magnetic field , however , both edge states and rashba soi change the pattern of dhva oscillations , as clearly seen in figs .",

    "8(c)-(d ) the cases without rashba soi .",
    "one can see that the total effects are the superposition of effects from both the edge states and rashba soi .",
    "now we turn to study the magnetic susceptibility @xmath168 for the 2deg . from eq .",

    "( [ e3a ] ) is zero due to the fact that both the landau and the zeeman splittings of the energy spectrum are linear in @xmath2 .",
    "thus in this case ( zero temperature and no edge states ) the magnetic susceptibility is simply written as @xmath171 furthermore , if the soi is disregarded , the derivative @xmath172 in quantizing magnetic fields ( except at even integer filling factors ) is equal to @xmath173   .\\label{e3c}%\\ ] ] then eq .",

    "let us first see the soi effect on the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "figure 9(a ) shows @xmath176 as a function of @xmath177 for the edgeless 2deg .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "9(a ) that there are a series of equal - distance resonance peaks appearing in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath178 with the magnetic field with / without the rashba coupling @xmath26 . with the magnetic filed increasing , the magnitude of the resonance susceptibility increases . similar to that of the magnetization , the explanation of the resonance peaks of the magnetic susceptibility without rashha coupling also needs the help of the filling factor @xmath179 .",
    "when @xmath138 increases to an integer value , the 2deg is incompressible . at this time , all the available states in the @xmath138 lowest landau levels are filled . upon increasing the inverse magnetic field @xmath177 , the electrons are transferred to the next landau level .",
    "thus the chemical potential changes discontinuously ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and the magnetization jumps ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . therefore there is a corresponding resonance peak appearing in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath178 .",
    "when the rashba spin - orbit coupling is introduced , it will destroy the simply linear relation between the filling factor @xmath138 and the inverse magnetic field @xmath177 . when the value of @xmath177 is larger , the soi effect is more evident ( see the red line in the fig .",

    "9(a ) and 9(b ) , which corresponding to the case without rashba spin - orbit coupling , one can find that the resonant ( for magnetic susceptibility ) magnetic field shifts to larger values for the case with edges .",
    "we have obtained the conclusion that the edges not only affect the center of the dhva oscillation , but also the values of the magnetic field when the magnetization has the discontinuous change . as a consequence ,",
    "the conditions of the susceptibility ( defined as @xmath178=@xmath181 ) having resonance are the same with those of the magnetization .",
    "when the rashba spin - orbit coupling is introduced , similar to the case in the sample without edges , the rashba coupling changes the resonance condition .",

    "in summary , we have systematically studied the dhva oscillations of the magnetization and its susceptibility for the 2deg with the edges states and soi included in the system .",
    "we find that the edge states and rashba soi play important roles when the external magnetic field is small .",
    "the edge effect prominently changes the oscillation center and oscillation amplitude .",
