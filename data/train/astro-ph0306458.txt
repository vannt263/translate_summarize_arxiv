    "2000 ) . furthermore , most planets known to date orbit around solar - mass stars with spectral types of late - f , g and early - k with the exception of a planet around the m4-dwarf gl876 , which has an estimated mass of 0.30.4m@xmath4 ( delfosse et al . 1998 , marcy et al .",

    "the search for planets around very young as well as around very low - mass stars ( and even down to the substellar regime ) is particularly interesting since the detection of _ young _ planets as well as a census of planets around stars of all spectral types , and maybe even around brown dwarfs , is an important step towards the understanding of planet formation",
    ". it would provide empirical constraints for planet formation time scales .",
    "furthermore , it would show if planets can exist around objects which are of considerably lower mass and surface temperature than our sun .",
    "we have therefore carried out a rv survey for ( planetary and brown dwarf ) companions to young brown dwarfs and very low - mass stars in the chai star forming region .",
    "it is aimed at the finding of young planets and brown dwarf companions with an age of a few million years around mid- to late - m dwarfs close or below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the detection of planets around brown dwarfs as well as the detection of young spectroscopic brown dwarf binaries ( brown dwarf  brown dwarf pairs ) would , on the other hand , be an important clue towards the formation of brown dwarfs .",
    "so far , no planet is known orbiting a brown dwarf .",
    "there have been detected several brown dwarf binaries , among them there are three spectroscopic , and hence close , brown dwarf binaries ( basri & martn 1999 , guenther & wuchterl 2003 ) .",
    "however , all known brown dwarf binaries are fairly old and it is not yet established if the typical outcome of the brown dwarf formation process is a binary or multiple brown dwarf system or a single brown dwarf .",
    "furthermore it is not known , if brown dwarfs can have planets .",
    "the targets of our rv survey are a population of 12 young bona fide and candidate brown dwarfs ( spectral type m6m8 ) in the center of the chai star forming cloud ( distance @xmath5160pc ) with ages of 15myr .",
    "they have been detected by comern et al .",

    "furthermore , our sample includes several young ( @xmath7 10myr ) , very low - mass t  tauri stars in the region , b34 , chxr74 and sz23 , which have spectral types of m2.5m5 and masses of about 0.10.3m@xmath4 ( comern et al .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath8 = 40000 ) spectroscopy has been performed of the objects in the red region of the optical wavelength range ( 67001@xmath9 m ) with the echelle spectrograph uves at the 8.2 m vlt kuyen telescope at eso paranal , chile .",
    "we took several spectra , at least two , of each of the objects in 2000 and 2002 .",
    "we have measured rvs with a precision of down to 40 m/s by means of cross - correlating plenty of stellar lines of the object spectra with a template spectrum using telluric lines as wavelength reference ( joergens & guenther 2001 ; joergens 2003 ) .",
    "the rv precision of the relative rvs ranges between 40 m/s and 600 m/s depending on the s / n of the individual spectra .",
    "the rv errors have been estimated by the deviations of two consecutive rv measurements based on two single consecutive spectra .",
    "we have found that the radial velocities for the bona fide and candidate brown dwarfs chah@xmath61 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 12 are constant within the measurements uncertainties ( fig.[bds ] ) .",

    "that means , that no planet around a young brown dwarf has been found and , furthermore , also the multiplicity fraction for close binary brown dwarfs among the sample is apparently rather low .",
    "there is , of course , the possibility that present companions have not been detected due to non - observations at the critical orbital phases .",
    "furthermore , long - period companions may have been missed .",
    "however , the found small multiplicity fraction of the bona fide and candidate brown dwarfs in chai at small separations , is also supported by the result of a direct imaging search for wide ( planetary or brown dwarf ) companions to the same targets , chah@xmath6112 , by neuhuser et al .",

    "middle and bottom panel of fig.[tts ] .",
    "the nature of these rv variations is still unclear .",
    "they could be caused by surface activity since prominent surface spots can cause rv variability due to the shifting of the photocenter while the star rotates .",
    "the other possibility is that they are caused by an orbiting mass pulling on the primary and causing a doppler wobble .",
    "if caused by orbiting companions , the detected rv variations correspond to planets of a few jupiter masses in close orbits around chxr74 and sz23 . as an example",
    ", a hypothetical orbit has been found for chxr74 , which matches the recorded rv data ( fig.[orbit ] ) .",
    "it shows that the rvs are consistent with a companion mass m@xmath0 of 2.6m@xmath13 orbiting in a circular orbit with a period of 28d .",
    "the upper limits for the rotational periods of chxr74 and sz23 are of the order of a few days based on projected rotational velocities @xmath14 ( joergens & guenther 2001 ) , i.e. a 28d periodicity , for example , can not be caused by rotational modulation due to surface features .",

    "the first data point is off by less than 1.5@xmath10 .",
    "however , follow - up observations have to explore the nature of the detected rv variatons . ]    in order to explore the nature of the detected rv variations and , if caused by companions , to solve the spectroscopic orbit , follow - up observations of chxr74 and sz23 are planned .",
    "if confirmed as planetary systems , they would be unique because they would contain not only the lowest mass primaries but with an age of a few million years also the by far youngest extrasolar planets found to date giving first empirical constraints for planet formation time scales .",
    "brown dwarfs are an important link between the two distinct populations of planets and stars .",
    "we still do not know by which mechanism brown dwarfs form .",
    "however , we expect that the exploration of the formation mechanism producing brown dwarfs may shed light also on some details of the planet formation .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that brown dwarfs are formed due to the ejection of protostars in the early accretion phase , which are thenceforward cut off from the gas reservoir and can not accrete to stellar masses ( reipurth & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "based on mean rvs derived within the presented rv survey , we have carried out a precise kinematic study of the bona fide and candidate brown dwarfs in chai .",
    "it showed that the rv dispersion of the brown dwarfs is relatively small , 2.2kms@xmath2 , and that the rvs cover a total range of only 2.6kms@xmath2 , indicating that none of the studied brown dwarfs has been ejected with higher velocity out of their birth place ( joergens & guenther 2001 ) .",
    "the rv dispersion of the brown dwarfs is significantly smaller than that of the t  tauri stars in the same field ( 3.6kms@xmath2 ) and slightly larger than that of the surrounding molecular gas ( 1.2kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "very recent dynamical calculations ( sterzik & durisen 2002 ; bate et al .",
    "2003 ) yield rather small ejection velocities for brown dwarfs , suggesting the possibility that the imprint of the ejection in the kinematics might not be an observable effect . however , these theoretical values for ejection velocities of brown dwarfs rely on certain model assumptions and are still a matter of debate . on the other side ,",
    "the kinematic study presented by us contributes a first observational constraint for the velocity distribution of a homogenous group of closely confined very young brown dwarfs and therefore an _ empirical _ upper limit for possible ejection velocities .",
    "we are very grateful to eike guenther for significant help with the spectroscopic observations and data analysis .",
