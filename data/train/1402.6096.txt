    "the problem of computing an @xmath0-mst is similar in flavor to the problem of computing a euclidean minimum weight degree-@xmath21 spanning tree , which has been studied extensively ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a minimum weight degree-@xmath21 spanning tree is a minimum weight spanning tree , such that the degree of each point is at most @xmath21 , where the interesting values of @xmath21 are 2,3 , and 4 .",
    "notice that for @xmath22 we get the euclidean traveling salesman path problem .",
    "the problem of computing an @xmath0-st is closely related to problems in which one needs to compute a hamiltonian path or cycle , with some restrictions on the angles .",

    ", directional antennas have received considerable attention ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , as they have some noticeable advantages over omni - directional antennas . in particular , they require less energy to reach a receiver at a given distance , and when broadcasting to this receiver the affected region is much smaller , reducing the probability of causing interference at friendly receivers or being subject to eves dropping by hostile receivers . with each point @xmath3",
    ", we associate a wedge @xmath7 of angle @xmath0 and apex @xmath4 .",

    "an interesting related problem is the _ antenna conversion _ problem .",
    "the _ unit disk graph _ of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath31 , is the graph in which there is an edge between @xmath4 and @xmath9 if @xmath32 .",

    "we then prove a surprising theorem , which , besides being interesting from a geometric point of view , has far - reaching applications , such as the one mentioned in the abstract .",
    "informally , the theorem states that any two such gadgets are connected .",
    "that is , let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be two triplets of points in the plane , and assume that the wedges ( associated with the points ) of @xmath40 and , independently , of @xmath41 are oriented according to the gadget construction instructions , then the graph induced by @xmath42 is connected .",
    "proving this theorem turned out to be a very challenging task , due to the huge number of possible configurations that must be considered , and only after arriving at the current three - stage proof structure ( see section  [ sec : main_theorem ] ) , were we able to complete the proof .",
    "in section  [ sec : tsp_apx ] , we present constant - factor approximation algorithms for computing an @xmath0-mst .",
    "in particular , we compute a @xmath43-approximation for a @xmath44-mst , a @xmath45-approximation for a @xmath25-mst , and a @xmath46-approximation for a @xmath23-mst .",
    "these approximations are actually with respect to a euclidean mst , which is a lower bound for an @xmath0-mst , for any @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : boundedrange ] , we present a solution to the antenna conversion problem for @xmath14 , based on the theorem above .",
