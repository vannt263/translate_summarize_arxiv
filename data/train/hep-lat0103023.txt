    "the @xmath5 parameter sets the scale in qcd . in the chiral limit it is the only parameter of the theory , and",
    "hence it is a quantity of fundamental interest .",
    "it is defined by the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath6  @xcite at high energies where non - perturbative effects are supposed to become small . lattice gauge theory provides a means of determining @xmath6 directly from low - energy quantities . in this letter",
    "we shall compute @xmath5 on the lattice in the quenched approximation as well as for @xmath1 species of degenerate dynamical quarks .",
    "previous lattice calculations have employed a variety of methods to compute the strong coupling constant , in quenched and unquenched simulations . for reviews",
    "see  @xcite . the scale parameter @xmath5 has been extracted from the heavy - quark potential  @xcite , the quark - gluon vertex  @xcite , the three - gluon vertex  @xcite , from the spectrum of heavy quarkonia  @xcite , and by means of finite - size - scaling methods  @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath5 from the average plaquette and the force parameter @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "both quantities are widely computed in lattice simulations . in the quenched case",
    "we have many data points over a wide range of couplings at our disposal already , and in the dynamical case we expect to accumulate more points in the near future . at present",
    "@xmath7 is the best known lattice quantity , at least in full qcd .",
    "it can easily be replaced with more physical scale parameters like hadron masses or @xmath8 when the respective data become more accurate .",
    "the calculations are done with the standard gauge field action @xmath9 and , in the dynamical case , with non - perturbatively @xmath2 improved wilson fermions  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the original wilson action and @xmath12 .",
    "if the improvement coefficient @xmath13 is appropriately chosen , this action removes all @xmath2 errors from on - shell quantities .",
    "a non - perturbative evaluation of this function leads to the parameterization  @xcite @xmath14 for @xmath1 flavors , which is valid for @xmath15 .",

    "1 supports this belief , as even for low orders the new series has oscillating coefficients .",

    "given the fact that our action has discretization errors of @xmath74 only , at least as @xmath85 , we expect the following small-@xmath87 behavior : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is not supposed to depend on @xmath38 anymore . similarly , we expect to find @xmath90 , with the difference that @xmath91 may still depend on @xmath38 : @xmath92 .",

    "the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 are strongly correlated though , indicating that it does not matter whether we are using @xmath39 or @xmath96 as the chiral extrapolation variable .",

    ", we subtract the mass dependence from the measured values of @xmath5 to obtain @xmath105 . a plot of @xmath106 against @xmath73 should then collapse all data points onto the single line @xmath107 . in the presence of significant higher - order terms not covered by our ansatz we would",

    "similarly , a plot of @xmath108 against @xmath96 should collapse the data onto the line @xmath109 .",
    "this is what we have plotted in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "we see that it does indeed bring all data points onto one line .",
    "we also see that the deviations from the line are probably not statistically significant , so adding any extra term to the fit , like @xmath110 , the deviation from the line is just going to give a fit to the noise .",
    "in fact , we have experimented with higher - order polynomials in @xmath87 and @xmath38 . in all cases",
    "we found the same result in the chiral and continuum limit within the statistical error .",
    "note that the slope of the line in fig .",
    "4 is very similar to the slope of the corresponding quenched line in fig .  2 .",
    "in the chiral and continuum limit our fit gives @xmath111 the first error is purely statistical , while the second one is an estimate of the systematic error , where we again have assumed that the higher - order contributions in eq .",
    "( [ convert ] ) are about 20% of the @xmath76 term . using @xmath77 , this gives @xmath112 a preliminary computation of the mass spectrum yields @xmath113 fm , if we take the @xmath79 mass to set the scale , in agreement with the phenomenological value used .",
    "how can our results be compared with the phenomenological numbers ?",
    "a fit to the world data of @xmath6 gives the average value at the @xmath114 mass  @xcite @xmath115 , which corresponds to @xmath116 .",
    "the latter value refers to an idealized world of five massless quarks and thus can not be compared immediately to our numbers .",
    "we may extrapolate @xmath72 to three flavors ( remember that @xmath7 is extracted from the phenomenological heavy quark potential ) and then evolve the corresponding @xmath117 to the @xmath114 mass , using the three - loop matching formulae  @xcite .",
    "we do this by extrapolating @xmath118 linearly in @xmath119 to @xmath120 , ignoring the fact that the strange quark mass is already relatively heavy and therefore less effective . for @xmath77",
    "this gives @xmath121 .",
    "( allowing for a 5% uncertainty of the physical scale parameter @xmath7 would increase the systematic error only slightly to @xmath122 . ) with the help of eq .",
    "( [ soln ] ) we now compute @xmath123 at the scale @xmath124 and obtain @xmath125 . taking the charm and bottom thresholds to be at 1.5 gev and 4.5 gev , respectively , we then find @xmath126 , a number which is somewhat lower than the phenomenological value .",
    "if , on the other hand , we evolve the phenomenological value down to @xmath127 and @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . a logarithmic extrapolation to @xmath1 , similar to our extrapolation of the lattice data but in reverse order , would give @xmath130 .    in fig .",
    "6 we compare the @xmath5 values obtained by the various methods . at energy scales below the charm mass threshold the physics should be determined by @xmath131 .",
    "so one would expect that the lattice numbers extrapolate smoothly to the corresponding phenomenological value .",
    "we see , however , that this is not the case .",
    "the reason for this mismatch remains to be found .",
    "our quenched result agrees very well with results of other calculations using different methods .",
    "we find significant @xmath74 corrections .",
    "for example at @xmath132 , corresponding to a lattice spacing @xmath133 , they amount to @xmath134 , which makes an extrapolation of the results to the continuum limit indispensible . in the dynamical case",
    "the data cover a much smaller range of @xmath87 , which makes the extrapolation to the continuum limit less reliable .",
    "but it is reassuring to see that the continuum limit is approached at a similar rate as in the quenched case .",
    "our dynamical calculation is similar in spirit to previous unquenched computations of @xmath6  @xcite ( albeit not exactly the same ) .",
    "the main differences are that we are using a non - perturbatively @xmath2 improved fermion action , which reduces cut - off effects , the conversion to @xmath48 is done consistently in two - loop perturbation theory , and an extrapolation of @xmath5 to the chiral and continuum limit is performed .",
    "we follow the argument in  @xcite calculating the relation between the @xmath5 parameters from the potential .",
    "we require that the potential ( or force ) between two static charges should be the same , whether computed as a series in @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "all we have to do to calculate the fermionic piece of the relation is to compute the fermionic contribution to the gluon propagator . in the scheme @xmath18",
    "we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the one - loop gluon contribution to the potential , and @xmath139 is the one - loop quark vacuum polarization . if two schemes , @xmath18 and @xmath140 , are to give the same answer for @xmath141 , their couplings have to be related by @xmath142 to find the fermionic part of the conversion from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , we have to calculate the vacuum polarization in both schemes and take the difference . in the @xmath22 scheme we find @xmath143 on the lattice we obtain @xmath144",
    "we see that there is an unwanted @xmath145 term in eq .",
    "( [ pi_lat ] ) unless @xmath146 . combining our calculation of @xmath147 with the calculation of the purely gluonic part in the literature  @xcite",
