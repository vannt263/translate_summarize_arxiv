    "in view of the possible creation of a quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) in high - energy heavy ion reactions at the sps , rhic and lhc accelerators , descriptions of the space - time evolution of the deconfined phase and its transition into the hadronic phase are very much called for .",
    "ideally , the transport equations should be directly derived from the qcd - lagrangian , a goal which is not yet achieved . instead a number of approximate formulations have been proposed .",
    "they are either derived from effective lagrangians ( like those by friedberg lee @xcite or nambu jona - lasinio @xcite ( njl ) ) or they are of monte - carlo cascade type @xcite with experimental input like string - fragmentation functions and/or cross sections .",
    "both approaches have their merits .",
    "while the ones based on effective lagrangians permit to study certain aspects of qcd ( e.g. chiral symmetry ) and their manifestation in the space - time evolution of a highly excited strongly interacting system , the phenomenological approaches are very helpful in the interpretation of the data .",
    "the approach presented in this paper is closer in spirit to the transport theories based on effective lagrangians .",
    "we propose a vlasov equation for the evolution of partons , where the medium dependent mass is directly obtained from qcd , more precisely from the results of lattice calculations .",
    "we concentrate on the transport properties of the qgp close to the phase transition , but do not describe hadron dynamics .",
    "the lattice calculations for qcd at finite temperature show a phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath0 which separates the regime of the qgp from the one of the hadrons .",
    "two aspects are related to the phase transition : restoration of chiral symmetry and confinement .",
    "they manifest themselves in rapid temperature variations around @xmath0 of the chiral condensate and the poliakov loop , respectively .",
    "both aspect are contained in the results ( often called `` data '' ) of lattice calculations .",
    "the basic assumption of our approach is the quasi - particle picture , with an effective mass @xmath1 , which in thermal equilibrium depends on the temperature @xmath2 , and on space time ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , in the non - equilibrium situation .",
