    "the term _ duality _ , in the meaning we use it here , was introduced in @xcite in the studies of the lam system . there , potentials with different values of the elliptic parameter @xmath0 were named dual if their spectra ( i.e. , the band - gap edges ) interchange under the switch @xmath1 . in the self - dual case ( the one corresponding to @xmath2 ) , the spectrum of the potential maps onto itself under the said switch .",
    "one way to understand this phenomenon lies through algebraisation of the lam potential , i.e. , through writing the hamiltonian in a matrix form .",
    "the property of the spectrum to transform into itself under the change @xmath3 was originally established in the studies of a sextic quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) potential .",
    "this property was termed as the @xmath4_energy reflection ( er ) symmetry_@xmath4 . @xmath4 in our article , we shall refer to it as the @xmath4_energy spectrum reflection ( esr ) property_@xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 in contrast to the lam model , wherein _ all _ the band - gap edges can be found by the matrix means , the qes problems normally permit only for partial algebraisation of the , generally infinite , spectrum . consequently , the esr symmetry refers only to its algebraic part . in this ,",
    "restricted sense , the sextic potential can be regarded self - dual .",
    "therefore , it is natural to hypothesise that there also exist _ dual _ sextic potentials whose algebraic parts of the spectra interchange under @xmath5 .",
    "such potentials were found in @xcite , and their duality was proven both by matrix methods and by the quantum - mechanical means ( with the schrdinger equation employed ) . here",
    "we study in a great detail the latter of these two approaches . in  @xcite , it was spelled out for the first time , that the symmetry of the quantum energy levels of a qes system stems from a symmetry of the corresponding classical system . in _ ibid .",
    "_ , the symmetry of the classical system was discussed in the canonical language of phase space . in the present work ,",
    "we shall show that classical and quantum symmetries can be uniformly described in the language of the action , for which , as we shall demonstrate , the term _ duality _ can be applied as well .",
    "this formalism allows one to explore at a deeper level the connection between the symmetries of the classical and quantum systems .",
    "specifically , it turns out that the symmetries of both kinds of systems can be understood from studying the global properties of the riemannian surfaces of classical and quantum momenta , correspondingly .",
    "this section addresses the esr symmetry of two classical systems governed by sextic potentials . to explore the behaviour of such systems",
    ", we shall employ some tools from the complex analysis , with elements of topology involved . aside from theoretical yield for classical mechanics , this study will lay the basis for the subsequent research on symmetry between the quantised counterparts of the classical systems considered .",

    "the integral along the closed contour @xmath20 is nonzero due to the presence of a branch cut of the momentum inside it , between the turning points.@xmath4 this singularity makes the contour non - contractible or , in the parlance of topology , homotopically non - trivial .",

    "the second sheet corresponds to the negative sign in front of the square root in  .",
    "however , it turns out that all the calculations needed in this section can be performed on one sheet only . ]",
    "now we shall express the action of the potential @xmath45 in terms of the integration cycles of the potential @xmath46 .",

    "so one obtains :    @xmath51    @xmath52    [ primeq ]    these integration cycles are linked to the actions as    @xmath53    hereafter primes will be omitted , because the equalities   make them redundant .",

    "so evaluation of this integral can be carried out with the aid of the residue at infinity : @xmath56 the key property of this result is that @xmath57 does @xmath4_not_@xmath4 depend on the energy . in other words , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as functions of energy , turn out to be linearly dependent .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath62 an equality to be referred to as _ duality of the action_. for the sum @xmath63 to come out energy - independent , not only the duality property was essential but also a simple analytic structure of the potential .",
    "had we started with potentials of a higher order , we would have encountered more branching points in the complex plane .",
    "so the sum of the cycles responsible for the classical actions would no longer be proportional to the residue at infinity , because other nontrivial cycles ( enclosing additional branching points ) would have emerged :    @xmath64    the latter is equivalent to @xmath65 [ 26 ]    with the right - hand side ( and , therefore , also the left - hand side ) being energy - dependent .",
    "this section was largely motivated by @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the method developed above for a polynomial potential can be easily applied to a periodic one . before demonstrating this ,",
    "let us recall the major differences between polynomial potentials and periodic potentials ( the latter assumed continuous along the real direction ) .",
    "first of all , if a potential ( as a function of a complex variable ) has a single period , then , instead of the entire complex plane , it can be defined on a strip . in this case",
    ", one of the coordinates can be compactified , and the function can be treated as if it were defined on a cylinder . if the potential is doubly - periodic , the situation is even better , in that the function can be naturally defined on a parallelogram compactifiable into a torus deprived of , at least , one point .",
    "this point corresponds to the pole which the periodic potential does necessarily have .",
    "indeed , while the polynomial potential has its only pole at infinity , the doubly - periodic function , in order not to be constant , must have poles inside the fundamental parallelogram , according to the liouville theorem .",
    "the riemannian surface of the corresponding momentum function can , generally , be of a different genus .",
    "another fundamental difference between the polynomial and periodic potentials comes from the fact that , while the former only allow for the bounded motion , the latter permit for both bounded and unbounded motion , see table  [ tab : motcla ] .",
    "unbounded motion corresponds to the energy set above the absolute maximum of the potential . in this case",
    ", there are no turning points , and the momentum behaves quite differently for the energies below and above the absolute maximum of the potential . for the bounded motion , the integration contour in the action integral is non - contractible due to the presence of the branch cut inside it . for the unbounded motion ,",
    "it is homotopically non - trivial due to the global properties of the riemannian surface .     below absolute maximum &    .types of motion in classical mechanics [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     & +    to solve the schrdinger equation  , it is often convenient to change variables : @xmath66 then the function @xmath67 satisfies the ricatti equation : @xmath68 in the limit @xmath69 , the function @xmath70 becomes the classical momentum  .",
    "so we shall call it the quantum momentum function ( qmf ) and introduce the notation : @xmath71 so the equation   takes the form : @xmath72    the quantisation condition , whence the @xmath73-th energy level is determined , is normally obtained from the requirement of single - valuedness of the function @xmath74",
    ". however , in @xcite a more interesting option was proposed .",
    "it was based on the fact that the wave function corresponding to the @xmath73-th energy level has @xmath73 zeros on the real axis , between the classical turning points ( the latter points being the zeros of the classical momentum ) @xcite .    in these zeroes ,",
    "the qmf has poles .",
    "indeed , it trivially follows from ( [ ch ] ) and ( [ 290 ] ) that @xmath75 for analytic potentials , the pole of the function @xmath76 is of the first order , and the residue at this pole is @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the integral of the qmf along the contour @xmath20 enclosing classical turning points is : @xmath78 where the contour @xmath20 should be close enough to the real axis , in order to avoid containing the poles and branch cuts of @xmath76 , that are off the real axis . in the classical limit ( @xmath69 ) , the series of poles inside @xmath20 coalesces into a branch cut of the classical momentum @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath79 is sometimes referred to as the quantum action function ( qaf ) @xcite , and the equality   itself    as the generalised bohr - sommereld quantisation condition ( gbs ) .",
    "the gbs is often employed as a starting point in studies of the spectra of quantum systems . the two common approaches to extract information from the ricatti equation are :    1 .   to employ the expansion of the qmf in the powers of @xmath80 ( the wkb method ) :",
    "@xmath81 a strong side of this approach lies in its clear physical meaning , in that the first two terms give the ordinary bohr - sommerfeld quantisation condition .",
    "a disadvantage of this method is that the form of   implies the neglect of exponentially small non - perturbative terms .",
    "hence all the results are valid only when tunneling is unimportant ( i.e. , at a distance from the relative maxima of the potential ) .",
    "this drawback can , however , be overcome , if one begins looking for the quantum action ( and , thereby , the energy ) in a form of trans - series in @xmath80 rather then of a polynomial .",
    "moreover , until recently , the usage of the gbs was the only systematic way of finding the multi - instanton corrections to the energy in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "+ substituting   into the ricatti equation   gives a recursive relation @xmath82 which allows to express all the higher terms   through the classical momentum : @xmath83 + next , we substitute the expansion   into   and get : . ]",
    "@xmath84 + the zeroth and first terms in   render : @xmath85 + the constant arising from the first term is often referred to as maslov index and can be calculated in various ways @xcite .",
    "importantly , it does not depend on the form of the potential well . after moving it to the rhs of",
    ", we arrive to the famous bohr - sommerfeld quantisation condition : @xmath86 + one may also proceed with calculating the higher - order terms in the lhs of  .",
    "this will , for example , provide a way to generate the perturbative expansion in the cases where it exists . to this end",
    ", one will have to solve   for the energy , inverting the series term by term .",
    "when taking the integrals , one should take into account then all the odd terms in the expansion of the qmf starting from @xmath87 are total derivatives and , so , the corresponding integrals in   vanish .",
    "2 .   to employ the laurent expansion of the qmf :",
    "@xmath88 this approach has not been studied in depth so far . in @xcite and @xcite an approximate method of finding the energies was suggested based on this idea . in this paper , we use the laurent expansion to find the residue of the qmf at infinity , in order to prove the esr property in the language of the qaf .",
    "these results rely on those obtained in @xcite .",
    "we also correct some overlooks made in _",
    "ibid_.      in this section we introduce the sextic qes potentials and discuss how the energy spectrum reflection property follows from the matrix form of the hamiltonians",
    ". then we learn how the esr can be formulated and proved on the language of the quantum action .",

    "since the subsequent discussion applies to both potentials shown in ( [ v ] ) , we shall concentrate on the even one , eqn .",

    "the latter can be obtained from the classical potential   by setting @xmath99 \\quad,\\qquad      c = \\dfrac{\\mu\\,\\nu}{4 } \\quad,\\qquad      d = \\dfrac{\\nu^2}{8 } \\quad.\\label{abc}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the change of sign @xmath100 leads to @xmath101 , whence the potentials with opposite values of @xmath102 are dual . in the notation    @xmath103",
    "the duality and self - duality conditions assume the form of    @xmath104    in @xcite , a theorem was proven stating that the eigenvalues of a tridiagonal matrix change their signs , when one changes the signs of the diagonal elements .",
    "the matrix   is exactly the case .",
    "thus , in accordance with the said theorem , the energies from the algebraic parts of the spectra of the even and odd potentials change their signs under the switch @xmath105 :    @xmath106    [ symmy ]    here @xmath107 and @xmath108 denote the highest energy levels in the algebraic sectors of the potentials :    @xmath109      for different values of the parameters , both qes sextic potentials fall either into the category   or into  .",
    "this means that the corresponding classical systems are dual to each other .",
    "let us discuss these two cases using our new notations .",
    "here we shall limit our discussion to the even potential .    1 .   in the case @xmath110",
    "both potentials , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are of the double - well shape , see figure  [ f1 ] , ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the duality takes place in the following range of energies : @xmath113 2 .   in the case @xmath114",
    "one of the potentials has a single minimum , while another one has three of them , see figure  [ f1 ] , ( c ) and ( d ) . for definiteness ,",
    "assume @xmath115 .",
    "then the energy ranges wherein the duality occurs look as follows : @xmath116    in both cases , @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote the values of the corresponding potentials at the minima , and the following equality takes place : @xmath119 from the formul   and   it ensues that , without loss of generality , we can assume that the equation @xmath120 has four solutions .",

    ", one has to replace @xmath122 with @xmath123 in both   and  .      a different way to prove the esr property   of the energy levels of dual potentials follows from relating their quantum actions .",
    "this implies derivation of a quantum analogue to  .",
    "despite the fact that we do not know the expression for the qmf ( obtaining whereof would be equivalent to solving the schrdinger equation ) , we can calculate its residue at infinity by substituting the laurent expansion into the ricatti equation  , as was proposed in @xcite .",

    "here we discuss a general method applicable to arbitrary potentials . ]    for the time being , we shall perform our calculations for the even potential .",

    "indeed , as was demonstrated in @xcite , the poles of the qmf emerge only on the branch lines of the classical momentum , which in our case are the segments of the real and imaginary axes , enclosed by @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "this remarkable property allows us to employ the same integration contours for the qmf , as those employed for the classical momentum .",
    "we also assume the point @xmath134 to be an isolated singularity , which is indeed the case for the considered qes potential , as was demonstrated in @xcite .",

    "in other words , for an even @xmath73 , the @xmath73-th energy level is symmetric to the @xmath168-th energy level : @xmath169    it is worth noting that the energies @xmath170 and @xmath171 share a perturbative part and differ only due to the non - perturbative splitting called into being by the tunneling effects .",
    "these effects get smaller near the bottom of the wells , and become strong closer to the maximum . at the perturbative level ( in neglect of the splitting ) , one can say that the level @xmath172 is symmetric to two levels : @xmath159 and @xmath173 .",

    "the summation reads as : + @xmath220      as we have already mentioned , our studies of the qes systems in the language of the qaf formalism were largely inspired by the results obtained in @xcite by geojo , ranjani and kapoor .",

    "_ on the following items :    * for the sextic potential , the assumption of the qmf to have an isolated pole at infinity leads to the condition of quasi - exact solvability for this potential .",
    "* the residue of the qmf can be calculated explicitly by substituting the laurent expansion of the qmf into the ricatti equation .",
    "however , in @xcite an oversight was made when the authors implicitly assumed the contour enclosing the real poles of the qfm to enclose _ all _ the poles of the qmf . in our notation",
    "( see figure  [ roots6 ] ) , this oversight reads as : @xmath221 in reality , however , the singularities which are off the real axis should also be taken into account , in order to obtain the correct expression  .",
    "due to the said omission , the authors got a wrong result for the residue of the qmf at infinity , which in their case turned out to be dependent on the number of the energy level.@xmath4 from the equation ( 6 ) in @xcite had to be different from the meaning of @xmath73 from the equation ( 20 ) in _ ibid_. in the former equation , @xmath222 is related to the number of the energy level , while in the latter it is the number of the highest energy level from the algebraic sector ( @xmath107 in our notation ) . ]",
    "now we would like to trace the connection between the duality property of the classical action   and its quantum analogue  . to do so",
    ", we shall employ the wkb method and show that the equations   and   can be obtained in the bohr - sommerfeld approximation ( i.e. , by taking into account the leading - order and next - to - leading - order terms in the expansion of the qmf in powers of @xmath223 ) .",
    "this however is not a general rule . in the next section",
    ", we shall perform an analogous calculation for a periodic potential .",
    "as we shall see , in that case it will be necessary to take into account _ all _ the perturbative orders of the wkb expansion , in order to reconstruct the exact esr property .",

    "we arrive at : @xmath224 which virtually coincides with  .",
    "it is only the extra term @xmath225 in the brackets , that makes   different from  .",

    "@xmath227 thus , due to the unique feature of the considered qes potential , @xmath228 the quantum esr symmetry can be explained in the bohr - sommerfeld approximation .",
    "had we carried out our proof starting from the usual bohr - sommerfeld quantisation condition   instead of  , we would have been able to prove the esr symmetry at the perturbative level only . in other words",
    ", we would have proved that the two levels below in the double - well energy region of one of two dual potentials are symmetric to some level in the single - well region of another one .",
    "we now offer a couple of comments on non - perturbative corrections which never showed up in our developments . as one calculates the energy in potentials with degenerate minima",
    ", such corrections typically arise : ( a ) below the absolute maximum of the potentials , due to the tunneling between the two wells ; ( b ) above the absolute maximum ( in the single - well region ) , owing to the over - the - barrier reflection . in the case of deep wells ,",
    "these corrections become exponentially small for the energy levels far from the maximum of the potential . in the double - well ( single - well ) region of the sextic potential ,",
    "the corrections are negative ( positive ) for even levels , and are positive ( negative ) for the odd ones",
    ".    it would be important to undescore the following two circumstances :    1 .",
    "up to the equation , no non - perturbative corrections have been omitted , since we had made no assumption on the specific form of the qmf .",
    "for this reason , the equations   and   are _ exact _    a fact already known from the algebraic considerations , see section  [ algappr ] ) .",
    "2 .   as we already stated",
    ", the form of the series in   implies the neglect of the non - perturbative terms .",
    "the more remarkable it is that we have nevertheless arrived at the exact result  .",
    "the reason for this is easy to guess .",
    "the instanton action ( a cycle enclosing @xmath229 in figure  [ roots6 ] ) and the action emerging due to the over - the - barrier reflection ( a cycle enclosing @xmath230 in figure  [ roots62 ] ) have opposite signs and cancel in  . accordingly , the corrections to the symmetric energy levels have opposite signs .",
    "the exponentially small leading - order corrections are easy to obtain , and they indeed do match . from the duality property of the potential",
    ", it ensues that @xmath231      in this section , we consider a qes periodic potential and perform calculations analogous to those done in section  [ sexticqes ] for the sextic potentials .",
    "first , we find an exact expression interrelating the qmf s of dual potentials .",
    "then we study its wkb expansion .    through section  [ ellqes ]",
    ", we shall be using the units in which @xmath232 .",
    "the potential   turns out to be quasi - exactly solvable if one sets @xmath233 for convenience , we also set @xmath234 thus we arrive at the potential of the lam model : @xmath235 the corresponding shrdinger equation @xmath236 \\psi\\,(x ) = e \\psi\\,(x)\\ ] ] has a continuous spectrum consisting of @xmath237 finite bands and an upper band extending to infinity .",

    "the duality property has the same shape as  : @xmath249 now , taking into account that @xmath250 and changing @xmath251 we finally arrive at : @xmath252 the latter equality looks very much like the equation   for the sextic potential , and leads us to analogous results .    in terms of the quantum actions , the esr property   reads as :    @xmath253    [ dudu ]    starting from  , we shall demonstrate that condition   has to be fulfilled .",
    "the integration contours for the qmf stay the same as in the classical case , see figure  [ pxnuriem ] .",

    "the classical part of   is given by  : @xmath259 which in the limit @xmath260 differs from   by maslov index @xmath261 .",

    "the reason for this is the same as was in the case of the double - well potential .",
