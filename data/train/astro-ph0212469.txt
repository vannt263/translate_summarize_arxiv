    "the fate of a massive star is governed chiefly by its mass and composition at birth and by the history of its mass loss .",
    "for single stars , mass loss occurs as a result of stellar winds for which there exist semi - empirical estimates .",
    "thus , within currently existing paradigms for the explosion , the fate of a star of given initial mass and composition is determined ( the russell - vogt theorem ) .",
    "if so , one can calculate realization frequencies for stellar explosions and remnants of various kinds and estimate how these might have evolved with time .",
    "such estimates are fraught with uncertainty .",
    "the litany of complications is long and requires discussion (   [ sec : uncer ] ) .",
    "no two groups presently agree , in detail , on the final evolution of _ any _ massive star ( including its explosion energy , remnant mass , and rotation rate ) and the scaling of mass loss with metallicity during different evolutionary stages is widely debated .",
    "still it is worthwhile to attempt an approximate table of histories .",
    "we would like to know , within the comparatively well understood domain of stars that do not experience mass exchange with a companion and for a particular set of assumptions regarding mass loss and explosion , what sort of supernova each star produces and what sort of bound remnant , if any , it leaves . if possible , we would also like some indication of which massive stars might make gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in this paper we construct such a table of stellar fates and remnants . in   [ sec : assump ] we describe our assumptions regarding mass loss , explosion mechanism(s ) , and remnant properties , and in   [ sec : uncer ] discuss the uncertainties .",
    "section 4 delineates the sorts of stellar explosions and collapses we want to distinguish , and in   [ sec : pop ] we discuss the resulting realizations of different outcomes as a function of metallicity in the galaxy .",

    "these papers treat the evolution of massive stars in the range 9 to 300 @xmath0calculated without rotation from birth on the main sequence to death , either as iron - core collapse supernovae ( helium core masses at death less than about 65 @xmath0 ) or pair instability supernovae ( helium core masses at death greater than 65 @xmath0and up to about 135 @xmath0 ) .",
    "the effects of mass loss were included in those studies as discussed in   [ sec : mdot ] .",
    "we shall presume here that the explosion mechanism , however it may operate , and the remnant properties are determined by the mass of the helium core when the star dies .",
    "( perhaps the carbon oxygen core mass is a better discriminant , but systematics of the two are very similar ) .",
    "as the mass of the helium core increases , so does its binding energy and entropy .",
    "because of its higher entropy , a larger helium core also has , on the average , a larger iron core mass , and a shallower density gradient around that core @xcite .",
    "consequently such stars are harder to explode @xcite . even in `` successful '' explosions where",
    "a strong outward shock is born , mass may later fall back onto a neutron star remnant turning it , within one day , into a black hole .",

    "@xcite has estimated that the helium core mass where black hole formation by fall back ensues is about @xmath1 ( a @xmath225 @xmath0main sequence star ) and that direct black hole formation occurs for helium cores over @xmath3 ( @xmath4 main sequence star with no mass loss ) .",
    "these numbers are uncertain (   [ sec : uexp ] ) , but are representative choices .",
    "it is assumed that a baryonic remnant mass of over 2.0 @xmath0will produce a black hole .    while the helium core mass governs the explosion mechanism , the hydrogen envelope is largely responsible for determining the spectrum ( at peak ) and light curve of common type ii supernovae .",

    "low metallicity stars form black holes directly , while at higher metallicities black holes of smaller mass are produced by fall back until , ultimately , only neutron stars are made .",
    "winds are assumed to be stronger in higher mass stars , so the metallicity at which these transitions occur decreases with mass . but",
    "beyond @xmath11 , this limit may rise again due to high enough initial mass or the significant role of evolution phases with lower mass loss rates ( e.g. , a wnl phases ; see @xcite ) .    at low metallicities ,",

    "[ fig : remnant ] _ _  [ fig : jetsn]__.    though there is general consensus that reducing the initial metallicity of a massive star will increase its mass when it dies , the scaling of mass loss with @xmath82 during different stages of the evolution is controversial .",

    "this is almost certainly naive .",
    "@xcite argue for a scaling z@xmath83 for stars with @xmath84 and @xmath85 for b - supergiants with @xmath86 .",
    "@xcite argued for a @xmath87 scaling in wn and wc stars , but for wc stars at least they had in mind the abundance of carbon in the atmosphere of the star , not the initial metallicity . on theoretical grounds",
    ", @xcite discusses a universal scaling for mass loss in hot stars that goes at @xmath87 but which has a threshold below which the mass loss declines more sharply .    for red supergiants ,",
    "even the mass loss at solar metallicity is not well determined . at higher stellar masses",
    "the mass loss from luminous blue variables and wr stars also constitutes a major source of uncertainty as do pulsationally - induced and rotationally - induced outflows ( see above ) .",
    "[ sec : uexp ]    the mechanism whereby the collapse of the iron core in a massive star results in a strong explosion has been debated for decades .",
    "the current paradigm is based on a neutrino powered `` hot bubble '' formed just outside the young proto - neutron star , but even the validity of this paradigm is debated along with its specific predictions @xcite .",
    "the role of rotation and magnetic fields is also contentious ( @xcite ; ",
    "[ sec : urot ] ) .",
    "our intuition here has been guided by parametric surveys in which the explosion is simulated using a piston .",
    "the numerous uncertainties are thus mapped into choices of the piston s location and motion .",
    "these parameters are constrained by the requirement that the explosion not eject too much neutron - rich material ( hence a minimum mass interior to the piston ) and that the kinetic energy of the explosion measured at infinity be @xmath88 .",
    "though a single event , sn 1987a occurred for a representative helium core mass ( @xmath89 ) and had a measured kinetic energy at infinity of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the requirement that supernovae typically make @xmath70.1 @xmath0of @xmath5ni also means that the piston can not be situated too far out or produce too weak an explosion .",
    "there are also more subtle conditions - that the mass cut frequently occur in a location where past ( successful ) calculations of the explosion have found it , that the distribution of remnant masses resemble what is observed for neutron stars , that the integrated ensemble of abundances resemble population i in our galaxy , and so on .",
    "[ fig : z0rem ] _ _ shows the remnant masses for a survey of explosions in solar metallicity stars that neglects mass loss . the progenitor stars described in @xcite were exploded using a piston located at the edge of the `` iron core '' .",
    "the iron core was defined by the location of an abrupt jump in the neutron excess ( electron mole number = @xmath91 ) . a constant kinetic energy at infinity ( @xmath92 )",
    "was assumed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the explosion energy will probably vary with mass .",
    "@xcite calculates that the explosion energy will actually weaken as the mass of the helium core increases .",
    "thus fall back could have an even earlier onset and more dramatic effects than fig .",
    "[ fig : z0rem ] _ _ would suggest .    the apparent non - monotonic behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : z0rem ] _ _ is largely a consequence of the choice of where the piston was sited .",
    "the neutronized iron core may have a variable mass that depends on details of oxygen and silicon shell burning @xcite .",
    "the density gradient around that core can also be highly variable .",
    "thus enforcing a constant kinetic energy at infinity does not always lead to a predictable variation of remnant mass with initial mass .",
    "more recent unpublished calculations by @xcite , also of zero metallicity stars , place the piston at an entropy jump ( dimensionless entropy s/@xmath93 ) rather than a @xmath94jump .",
    "this choice , which is more consistent with explosion models , assumes that an explosion develops when the accretion rate declines rapidly .",
    "the rapid decline is associated with the density ( and entropy ) discontinuity near the base of the oxygen burning shell .",
    "such a prescription gives more nearly monotonic results and , in particular the bump around @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig : z0rem ] _ _ is absent .    nevertheless fig .",
    "[ fig : z0rem ] _ _ does suggest that the lines separating black hole formation by fall back from neutron stars in figs . 1 - 4 should be interpreted only as indicating trends",
    ". they may not be as smooth or as monotonic as indicated .",
    "[ sec : urot ]    rotation can enhance the mass loss in stars and a spread in initial rotation can smear out the transitions between the different mass and metallicity regimes .",
    "we have not considered cases where rotationally enhanced mass loss might be important . in such cases the limiting mass for loss of the hydrogen envelope could be lowered and , at the same time , the mass of the helium core increased @xcite .",
    "the higher mass loss would tend to lower the metallicity for divisions between type ii and type ib / c supernovae as well is the divisions between strong , weak and no supernova explosions .",
    "the higher helium core masses with increase the metallicity divisions between strong , weak , and no supernova explosions .",
    "the total change will depend on the competition of the larger helium core masses and enhanced mass loss rate .",
    "if the core is rotating rapidly at collapse , rotation may also influence the explosion mechanism and especially the possibility of making a grb .",
    "also pair - creation supernovae could be significantly affected by rotation , in particular the lower mass limit for direct black hole formation @xcite .",
    "early calculations that followed angular momentum in massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) all found sufficient angular momentum retained in the core to reach critical rotation ( `` break - up velocity '' ) before the final central burning phases .",
    "more recent calculations by @xcite find presupernova core rotation rates in massive stars that would lead to sub - millisecond neutrons stars just around break - up if angular momentum were conserved perfectly during the collapse .",
    "calculations by @xcite ; maeder & meynet , priv .  com .",
    "( 2000 ) indicate core rotation rates after central helium burning similar to those found by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite has discussed a `` dynamo '' mechanism based on the interchange instability that allows the estimation of magnetic torques to be included in models for stellar evolution .",
    "preliminary calculations by @xcite that include these torques find a presupernova angular momentum equivalent to 5 - 10 milliseconds  still somewhat faster than observed young pulsars , but too slow for collapsars .",
    "if the estimates of magnetic torques by @xcite are valid then single stars are unlikely to produce collapsars and rotation is probably not a factor in the explosion of common supernovae . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapsar ] _",
    "_ we indicate the regimes where the structure of the star , excluding the question of sufficient rotation , is favorable for collapsars and grbs .",
    "[ sec : con ]    we have described , qualitatively , the likely fates of single massive stars as a function of metallicity .",
    "our results suggest various trends in the observations of these objects which may be subject to observational tests .    *",
    "normal type ib / c sne are not produced by single stars until the metallicity is well above solar .",
    "otherwise the helium core mass at death is too large .",
    "this implies that most type ib / c sne are produced in binary systems where the binary companion aids in removing the hydrogen envelope of the collapsing star . *",
    "although less extreme than type ib / c sne , single stars also do not produce type iil sne at low metallicities .",
    "similar to type ib / c sne , type iil sne from single stars are probably `` weak '' sne until the metallicity exceeds solar , also implying that type iil sne are produced in binaries . *",
    "if grbs are produced by single star collapse ( perhaps unlikely given the constraints on angular momentum ) , single stars only make up a small subset of grb progenitors at higher metallicities .",
    "it is more likely that binary systems form grbs .",
    "such systems will occur more frequently at low metallicities @xcite .",
    "* jet - driven supernovae from single stars are likely to be much more common than grbs from single stars .",
    "it is difficult to make direct comparisons to observations without including binary stars in our analysis , but there are a number of constraints that should be considered .",
    "first , an increasing number of jetsne and weak supernovae explosions are being discovered @xcite .",
    "although there is an observational bias against the discovery of weak supernovae and they are much dimmer than jetsne , they may still dominate the sample of stars more massive than 25@xmath0 .",
    "clearly , good statistics ( and correct analysis of the systematics ) are necessary to determine the relative ratio of jet - driven and weak sne . with such statistics , we may be able to place constraints on the rotation of massive stellar cores .",
    "if the imf becomes more top - heavy at low metallicity ( @xmath2@xmath96 ; @xcite ) the number of core collapse supernovae ( mostly type iip ) and grbs ( if occurring in single stars ) should significantly increase at high redshift . if the current estimates of a characteristic mass of @xmath11 for primordial stars @xcite is correct we should expect a large fraction of pair sne and very massive black holes ( or type iii collapsars ) at zero metallicity , as well as an increase of massive black holes from stars in the 60140@xmath0region .",
