    "it is well known that during the fabrication process of superconductor materials , a variety of point defects , such as substitution and interstitial impurities , vacancies , and cation - disorder are involved .",

    "high critical current densities can be achieved by the presence of high - density defects which will provide suitable pinning centers for the magnetic flux lines .",
    "the ideal size of defects for flux line pinning should be comparable to the superconducting coherence length . for cuprates such as yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( y-123 ) ,",
    "the coherence lengths are in the order of tens of angstroms while the conventional superconductors have a coherence length of several thousand angstroms .",
    "thus atomic - scale structural inhomogeneities such as point defects and columnar defects can play an important role in flux - line pinning @xcite .",
    "an increasing number of applications of the 123-type high-@xmath5 superconductors use materials other than y-123 .",
    "for example , in many bulk forms and multilayer applications , y is replaced by nd , sm , or other rare - earth elements ( re ) .",
    "doping yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 with ca , sr , or other alkaline earth elements ( ae ) has also been shown to improve bulk and grain boundary transport and other properties @xcite .",
    "since it is well - known that strain effects are important in the studies of point defects , it is expected that studies of strain effects on point defects for series of reba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( re-123 ) compounds will be important for practical applications of superconductivity . in particular , the concentration and ordering of oxygen vacancies have significant effects on the superconducting properties . for y-123 , the superconducting temperature , @xmath5 , depends on the oxygen stoichiometry . as an example of a generic doping curve in cuprates @xcite , when @xmath6 is larger than around 0.7 , the crystal loses superconductivity .",
    "however , if @xmath6 is smaller than 0.7 , the compound is superconducting .",
    "it is generally believed that higher oxygen content can create more holes in the structure .",
    "when @xmath6 is between 0.1 and 0.7 , the crystal is in the underdoped region , and @xmath5 increases with increasing hole concentration .",
    "when the oxygen content is in the proper range , @xmath5 is above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen .",
    "however , if more holes are created , the @xmath5 value decreases instead , and the crystal is in an overdoped region .",
    "oxygen ordering in the cu - o chains of the 123 structure gives rise to further complex structures @xcite .",
    "even when the average occupancies of oxygen sites remain constant , the occupation at chain and anti - chain sites can vary .",
    "jorgensen et al .",
    "@xcite observed that the superconducting transition temperature in y-123 changes as a function of time following the quenching experiment while the oxygen content is fixed .",
    "this demonstrates that the specific ordering of the oxygen atoms in the basal plane is another important parameter that controls @xmath5 in the y-123 system @xcite .",
    "the ordering process in the cu - o chain is the origin of the structural transition between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases in the 123 structure , which has been extensively studied since the discovery of y-123 @xcite .",
    "structural transition of y-123 is strongly affected by external pressure as well @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are systematic results reported by wong - ng et al .",

    "the above experimental observations indicate that lattice strain may play an important role in phase transition , which has not been investigated theoretically and systematically so far .    in this paper , we plan to study the effects of homo - valent substitutions at y and ba sites , and hydrostatic pressure on the order - disorder transition theoretically .",
    "considering large stress fields due to dislocations around grain boundaries , this study will also provide valuable information for understanding the transport properties in the vicinity of grain boundaries .",
    "first we briefly explain methods used in atomistic simulations .",
    "secondly , we focus on the effects of strain on schottky defects and related phenomena for a series of homovalent substitutions at y and ba sites of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "although the 123 structure is not stable in the ca- and sr - analogs under ambient pressure @xcite , partial substitution of sr on the ba site has been reported @xcite .",
    "finally , strain effects on chain - oxygen order - disorder transition of reba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 will be investigated .",
    "since the parent compounds of high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors can be considered as charge - transfer insulators , ionic bonding can be assumed to have a large contribution to the lattice energy .",
    "methods used to study atomistic phenonmena in conventional oxides can therefore be applied to study cuprates .",
    "the cuprates become superconductors at a proper doping level and temperature .",
    "however , the charge carrier density is very low compared with that of conventional metals . in addition , the charge carriers are confined within copper - oxygen planes .",
    "consequently , the screening effect is not as strong as that of conventional metals .",
    "the lattice energy calculated from ionic models is somewhat over - estimated .",
    "the point defect s energy is also slightly overestimated due to the omission of screening effect in metallic region of the phase diagram , which can be improved by including polarization effects in the shell model @xcite .",

    "it allows the incorporation of compositional changes at the atomic level , but ignores explicit effects of disorder .",
    "for instance , when ba@xmath10 is partially replaced by sr@xmath10 in experiments , the composition - weighted average value of the two ions radii is taken to approximate that of each virtual divalent ion .",
    "after constructing a consistent interatomic pair potential set @xcite , we used the  general utility lattice program \" ( gulp ) @xcite , which integrates the above modeling methods at an atomistic scale , to study lattice energy , elastic constants , and lattice dynamic properties . in summary ,",

    "any deviation in a crystal from a perfect structure is an imperfection .",
    "the simplest imperfection is a lattice vacancy , which is a missing atom or ion , known as a schottky defect .",
    "schottky defects involve  multiple \" vacancies while preserving electrical neutrality .",
    "regardless of how a schottky defect is created , it is necessary to expend a certain amount of work per atom to take it to the surface .",

    "some vacancies are at anionic sites and others at the cationic sites . for y-213 ,",
    "the defect reaction is given as follows :    @xmath14    where v represents a vacancy . according to mass action law",
    ", the equilibrium constant ( k ) at a finite temperature can be written as    @xmath15    where c is the equilibrium concentration of vacancies ; @xmath16 is the average concentration of vacancies .",
    "the equilibrium concentration of the vacancy j , @xmath17 , can be computed from boltzmann statistics as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the number of atom j per unit volume , and @xmath20 is the energy required to take atom j from its lattice site inside the crystal to a site on the surface . substituting the equilibrium concentraions of vacancies into equation ( [ eq : mass ] )",

    "usually , the change of short - range repulsion is less significant than that of the madelung site potential . in general",
    ", the smaller absolute site potential value is favorable for lowering vacancy energy , and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , an increase of the total volume leads to the expansion of effective relaxation space so that the vacancy energy can further decrease due to the relaxation of the atoms . in the shell model",
    ", the electronic polarization due to the electronic relaxation also lowers the defect energy . in @xmath1 ( ae-123 ) , as the radius of the ion at ae - sites becomes larger , a similar phenomenon is observed . in both @xmath26 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the lower schottky defects formation energies are always associated with the larger volume .",
    "this indicates that the volume of formation of schottky defects is positive , or the volume of the entire crystal expands during the formation of schottky defects .    as shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , the complex structure of 123 compounds can be roughly divided into six layers along c - axis direction : re - cuo@xmath2(cu2)-bao - cuo(cu1)-bao - cuo@xmath2-re . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the distances between planes are represented by the separations of cations projected along c - axis .",
    "the external and internal strains are computed with y-123 as a reference .",
    "replacing y@xmath7 by larger re@xmath7 ions leads to positive external strains , indicating the dimensions of the cell expand as increasing re size .",
    "the more interesting observations are the changes of internal parameters within the unit cell .",
    "the variance of internal strains provide direct information of the changes of layers separations in re - series .",
    "the interatomic distances vary quite differently with ionic radius in the re-123 and ae-123 series @xcite .",
    "for instance , the distance of re - cuo@xmath2 becomes larger with increasing re size , which is expected from the change of short - range repulsion of re - o .",
    "however , even when the entire cell volume increases as re ion becomes larger , some parts of unit cell contract such as interlayer separations between cuo@xmath2(cu2)-bao and bao - cuo(cu1 ) ( or , bond lengths of cu2-o4 and cu1-o4 ) .",
    "consequently , the average energy of the point defect only decreases slightly because of the existing compressive blocks within the structure as plotted in fig .",
    "( 1 ) . in the ae-123 series ,",
    "when ba@xmath10 is ( partially ) replaced by smaller ae@xmath10 , the variances of external and internal strains are of the same sign , reflecting a somewhat  even \" expansion of the entire structure . the difference between re-123 and ae-123 is reflected by the changes of ae - ae and cu1-cu2 distances . unlike those in re-123 , for ae-123",
    "both distances become larger with increasing ae size .",
    "the different changes of internal strains due to doping at either y or ba sites governs the absolute value of slope of schottky defects of re-123 and ae-123 ( see fig .",

    "the reason is that the parent structure is fixed for former case , so that the trivalent ion larger than yttrium leads to more energy of solution .",
    "one the other hand , the schottky defect has to consider all the atoms in the unit cell . unless the structures change more or less  homogeneously \" , the energy of solution at one specific site may evolve differently from the schottky defect energy .",
    "recall that the relation between cell volume , bulk modulus of re-123 , and the trend of thermal expansion coefficients are also the manifestation of the complexity of the 123 structure @xcite .",
    "there is an  unusual \" relation between schottky defects formation energy and @xmath27 ( where b is bulk modulus and @xmath13 is the mean volume per atom ) of re-123 in figure ( [ fig : varotsos ] ) .",
    "as reported by varotsos @xcite , the schottky defects formation energy is proportional to @xmath27 for elemental and binary crystals . while this relation appears to be obeyed by the ae-123 series ,",
    "it is violated by the re-123 series .",
    "the possible reason is still the non - uniform changes of the interatomic distances within the unit cell for re-123 .",
