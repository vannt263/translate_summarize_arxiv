    "galactic nuclei with massive black holes ( mbhs ) are stellar systems with relaxation times that are often shorter than the age of the universe . in that case",
    "the distribution function ( df ) of the system may approach a steady state .",
    "this steady state is determined by the boundary conditions ( an inner sink , such as the tidal radius of the mbh , and an outer source at the interface with the host galaxy ) and by the mutual interactions between the stars themselves .",
    "the nature of the `` microscopic '' interactions between the stars determines the rate at which the system relaxes to its steady state .    with the notable exception of @xmath1-body simulations ( e.g. baumgardt , makino & ebisuzaki @xcite , @xcite ;",
    "preto , merritt & spurzem @xcite ; merritt & szell @xcite ) , analyses of the evolution of the df near a mbh have almost exclusively relied on the assumption that the mechanism through which stars exchange angular momentum and energy is dominated by _ uncorrelated two - body interactions _ ( chandrasekhar @xcite ; see binney & tremaine @xcite for a more recent discussion ) .",
    "this assumption is made in fokker - planck models ( e.g. bahcall & wolf @xcite [ hereafter bw76 ] ; bahcall & wolf @xcite [ hereafter bw77 ] ; cohn & kulsrud @xcite ; murphy , cohn & durisen @xcite ) , where the microscopic interactions are expressed by the diffusion coefficients , and in monte carlo simulations ( e.g. shapiro & marchant @xcite ; marchant & shapiro @xcite , @xcite ; freitag & benz @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "stars around mbhs are described as moving in the smooth average potential of the mbh and the stars , and the scattering by the fluctuating part of the potential is modeled as a hyperbolic keplerian interaction between a passing star and a test star .",
    "the scattering effects accumulate non - coherently in a random - walk fashion .",
    "the ( non - resonant ) relaxation time @xmath2 can be defined as the time @xmath3 it takes for the negative specific energy @xmath4 of a typical star ( hereafter `` energy '' ) to change by order unity .",
    "this is also the time @xmath5 it takes for its specific angular momentum @xmath6 ( hereafter `` angular momentum '' ) to change by an amount of order @xmath7 , the maximal ( circular orbit ) angular momentum for that energythroughout this paper , `` angular momentum relaxation time '' means the time it takes until @xmath6 is changed by order @xmath8 , rather than by order @xmath6 .",
    "the time - scale for changes by order @xmath9 is shorter than the angular momentum relaxation time by a factor @xmath10 . ] . in a spherical potential @xmath11/\\sqrt{2{\\mathcal{e}}}$ ] , where @xmath12 is the mbh mass , @xmath13 is the stellar mass and @xmath14 is the number of stars with orbital energies above @xmath15 ( more bound than @xmath15 ) .",
    "on keplerian orbits @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the semi - major axis .",
    "when relaxation is dominated by uncorrelated two - body interactions , the `` non - resonant '' relaxation time @xmath18 of stars of mass @xmath13 can be written in the keplerian regime as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the orbital period and @xmath21 is a dimensionless constant which includes the coulomb logarithm .",
    "we assume throughout a single mass stellar population ; for numerical estimates we assume @xmath22 .",
    "the assumption of uncorrelated two - body interactions is well - justified in many systems , such as globular clusters . however , rauch & tremaine ( @xcite , hereafter rt96 ) showed that this does not hold for motion in potentials with certain symmetries , in particular for keplerian motion in the potential of a point mass where the orbits do not precess because of the @xmath23 resonance between the radial and azimuthal frequencies .",
    "this is to a good approximation the case for stars orbiting close , but not too close to a mbh , since wider orbits precess due to the potential of the enclosed stellar mass , while tighter orbits precess due to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "as long as the precession timescale @xmath24 ( the time to change the argument of the periapse @xmath25 by @xmath26 ) is much longer than the orbital period , the orbits effectively remain fixed in space over times @xmath27 and the interactions are correlated .",
    "the orbiting stars can then be represented by one - dimensional elliptical `` wires '' whose mass density varies along the wire in proportion to the time spent there ( rt96 ) . in this picture the interaction between two stars can be described as the torque between two wires .",
    "this results in mutual changes in _ both _ the direction and the magnitude of the angular momenta .",
    "following rt96 , we denote such rr , which also changes the magnitude of @xmath28 _ _ , scalar rr__. the change grows coherently ( @xmath29 ) on timescales @xmath30 and non - coherently ( @xmath31 ) on longer timescales @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the `` resonant relaxation '' ( rr ) timescale for the angular momentum ( eq .",
    "[ e : trr ] ) . generally , @xmath34 when @xmath35 ( see eq .",
    "[ e : trrm ] ) .",
    "since the potential of the wires is stationary on time - scales @xmath36 , they do not exchange energy , and the energy relaxation timescale remains long , @xmath37 , even in the resonant regime .",
    "the mechanism of rr is reminiscent of the kozai mechanism in triple stars ( kozai @xcite ) .",
    "a more restricted type of rr occurs in any spherical potential , where the vector @xmath28 is conserved , but @xmath25 precesses . in that case",
    "the orbital rosette can be represented by a mass disk extending between the orbital periapse and apo - apse .",
    "the mutual torques exerted by such azimuthally symmetric disks change _ only _ the direction of @xmath28 , but not its magnitude .",
    "this type of rr persists even in the presence of gr precession .",
    "following rt96 , we denote such rr , which changes only the direction of @xmath28 , _",
    "vector rr_. the significance of the distinction between scalar and vector rr is that scalar rr can deflect stars into `` loss - cone '' orbits ( @xmath38 ) where they fall into the mbh , either directly ( `` infall '' ) or gradually ( `` inspiral '' ) , whereas vector rr can only randomize the orbital orientation , but can not affect the loss rate .    in this paper",

    "the resonant relaxation time @xmath39 is estimated by evaluating @xmath40 , the coherent change in the magnitude of the specific angular momentum up to a time @xmath24 .",

    "a test star fluctuates away from zero as @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath41 the torques on a particular star - wire become random , and the change in angular momentum grows in a random walk fashion with a timescale @xmath45 , defined here as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is a numerical factor of order unity , to be determined by simulations , and the last approximate equality holds in the keplerian regime .",
    "the @xmath1-body simulations of rt96 indicate that @xmath49 for scalar rr (  [ ss : trrs ] ) and @xmath50 for vector rr (  [ ss : trrv ] ) ( see their eqs .",

    "we adopt these values here .",
    "we verified these result , to within an order of unity , by carrying a few full small scale @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "our simulations exhibited a substantial scatter in the value of @xmath48 , as already noted by rt96 .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in quantitative estimates of the efficiency of rr .",
    "further detailed analysis and simulations , outside the scope of this study , are needed to refine these numerical estimates .      over most of the relevant phase space ,",
    "the precession is due to the deviations from pure keplerian motion caused by the potential of the extended stellar cluster ( `` mass precession '' ) .",
    "this occurs on a timescale @xmath54 , which assuming @xmath55 and after averaging on @xmath6 , can be expressed as    @xmath56    and where @xmath57 is a dimensionless constant . for simplicity",
    "we adopt here @xmath58 , the value for circular orbits .",
    "the @xmath6-averaged rr timescale can then be written as    @xmath59    since @xmath60 for small @xmath17 where @xmath55 , the rr rate of angular momentum relaxation is much higher than the rate of energy relaxation in the resonant regime .",
    "this qualitative analysis has been verified by detailed numerical @xmath1-body simulations by rt96 and by rauch & ingalls ( @xcite , hereafter ri98 ) .    for most of @xmath6-space ,",
    "orbital precession is dominated by the mass of the stellar cluster and the rr relaxation timescale is well approximated by @xmath61 , which is a function of energy only .",
    "however , when the orbital periapse is very close to the mbh , precession is dominated by gr effects ( `` gr precession '' ) .",
    "this is important for our analysis of the inspiral rate of gw sources (  [ sss : gw ] ) . in this case",
    "the timescale for precession is given by @xmath62 , which is a strong function of @xmath6 ,    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    is the angular momentum of the last stable orbit ( lso ) for an orbit of specific kinetic energy @xmath65 .",
    "generally , both precession mechanisms operate , and the scalar rr timescale @xmath66 is given by substituting @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ e : trr ] ) , where the opposite signs reflect the fact that mass precession is retrograde whereas gr precession is prograde .",
    "thus , the scalar rr timescale is@xmath68    when @xmath69 and gr precession dominates , the rr timescale is ( eq . [ e : trrm ] ) @xmath70    the fact that scalar rr becomes much less efficient due to gr precession is crucial for the viability of gw emission from inspiraling stellar objects ( `` extreme mass - ratio inspiral sources '' , emris ) , since it allows compact remnants to be very rapidly deflected to strongly relativistic orbits , but then stall `` on the brink '' and instead of falling directly into the mbh , inspiral into it gradually by the emission of gw .",
    "we return to this issue in  [ sss : gw ] .",
    "we analyze below the dynamics of scalar rr and its effects on the stellar df , both numerically (  [ s : dens ] ) and by monte - carlo simulations (  [ s : implications ] ) .",
    "these two approaches require different formulations of the rr timescale .",
    "the numerical analysis is carried out in the 1d @xmath15-space , where the @xmath6-dependences are absorbed in the @xmath6-averaged terms .",
    "for this purpose we use the relation @xmath71 ( eqs . [",

    "in this section we state our assumptions , approximations and definitions , many of which are commonly used in the analysis of stellar systems with mbhs .",

    "<S> resonant relaxation ( rr ) of orbital angular momenta occurs near massive black holes ( mbhs ) where the potential is spherical and stellar orbits are nearly keplerian and so do not precess significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting _ coherent _ torques efficiently change the magnitude of the angular momenta and rotate the orbital inclination in all directions . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> many of the tightly bound stars very near the mbh are rapidly destroyed by falling into the mbh on low - angular momentum orbits , while the orbits of the remaining stars are efficiently randomized . </S>",
    "<S> we solve numerically the fokker - planck equation in energy for the steady state distribution of a single mass population with a rr sink term . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the steady state current of stars , which sustains the accelerated drainage close to the mbh , can be @xmath0 larger than that due to _ non - coherent _ </S>",
    "<S> 2-body relaxation alone . </S>",
    "<S> rr mostly affects tightly bound stars , and so it increases only moderately the total tidal disruption rate , which is dominated by stars originating from less bound orbits farther away . we show that the event rate of gravitational wave ( gw ) emission from inspiraling stars , originating much closer to the mbh , is dominated by rr dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the gw event rate depends on the uncertain efficiency of rr . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency indicated by the few available simulations implies rates @xmath0 times higher than those predicted by 2-body relaxation , which would improve the prospects of detecting such events by future gw detectors , such as _ lisa . </S>",
    "<S> _ however , a higher , but still plausible rr efficiency can lead to the drainage of all tightly bound stars and strong suppression of gw events from inspiraling stars . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our results to the galactic mbh , and show that the observed dynamical properties of stars there are consistent with rr . </S>"
