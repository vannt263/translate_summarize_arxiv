    "the phase space factors for beta decay and electron capture were calculated since long time @xcite and were considered to be evaluated with sufficient accuracy . however , in those works the distortion of the electron wave functions ( w.f . ) by the coulomb field of the nucleus was taken into account through fermi functions which were expressed in terms of approximate radial solutions of the dirac equation at the nuclear surface .",
    "also , other corrections were introduced in the calculations in approximate ways .",
    "thus , the screening effect on the @xmath0 spectrum was included by various recipes , for example by replacing the v(z ) potential with a momentum dependent screening ( for low energy positrons ) @xcite , by modifying the electron radial w.f .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , etc .",
    "also , the finite size of the nucleus ( fns ) was taken into account by adding to the fermi functions obtained in the `` point - nucleus '' approximation , corrections that depend on the @xmath0 particle energy and nuclear charge z @xcite .",
    "also , for the nuclear radius , older formula has been used @xcite . for the ec process the electron bound - state radial w.f .",
    "were also obtained as approximate solution of the dirac equation evaluated at the nuclear surface .",
    "they were improved by including exchange and overlap corrections , which were obtained within a relativistic hf approach .    in this work",
    "we revisit the computation of the psf involved in the positron decay and electron capture ( ec ) processes for light and heavy nuclei of experimental interest .",
    "the dirac equation is solved numerically with a coulomb potential derived from a realistic proton distribution in the nucleus which includes the fns correction .",
    "the numerical procedure follows the power series method described in ref .",
    "@xcite and is similar to that described in refs .",
    "the screening effect was introduced by using a screened coulomb potential , obtained by multiplying the coulomb potential by a function @xmath1 , solution of the thomas - fermi equation obtained by the majorana method @xcite .",
    "the accuracy imposed in our numerical algorithms used to solve the dirac equation always exceeds the convergence criteria given in those references .",
    "also , a more efficient procedure to identify the electron bound states without ambiguity was developed .    in order to make a comparison between the actual psf values found in literature and ours ,",
    "the same psf are also computed with the approach described in refs . @xcite and using the same q - values . for positron",
    "decays our results are in close agreement with the other previous results , while for the ec process we found significant differences .",
    "for these processes we also find that the screening effect has a notable influence on the computed psf values for light nuclei .",
    "further , we re - computed the same psf values using up - dated q values , reported recently in literature @xcite , which for several light nuclei differ significantly from the older ones .",
    "as an example we cite the maximum @xmath0-particle energy ( referred to as @xmath2 throughout this paper ) stated in table  2 of ref .",
    "these @xmath2 values differ considerably from those given in ref .",
    "one reason for this big difference could be that wilkinson @xmath3 macefield , in order to compare their calculation with those performed earlier by towner @xmath3 hardy @xcite , restricted their phase space to only pure fermi transitions . in other words the gamow - teller window was not accessed in phase space calculation of @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper we propose new psf values computed with a more accurate method and using up - dated q - values , for a large number of nuclei of experimental interest .",
    "our calculations can be useful for more reliable computation of the beta decay rates of nuclei far from the stability line , as well as for better understanding of the stellar evolution .",
    "our work is further motivated by similar calculations done for the double - beta decay ( dbd ) process .",
    "the psf for dbd were also considered for a long time to be computed with enough accuracy and were used as such for predicting dbd lifetimes . however , recently , they were recalculated with improved methods , especially for positron and ec decay modes @xcite and several differences were found as compared to previous calculations where approximate electron / positron w.f . were used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present briefly the two approaches used to compute our psf values .",
    "our results are reported in section iii .",
    "here we compare them with experimental data and previous results and discuss the differences .",
    "finally , we summarize the main points and present our conclusions in section iv .",
    "following essentially the formalism from ref .",
    "@xcite , we give here the necessary equations which we use to calculate the psf .",
    "the probability per unit time that a nucleus with atomic mass a and charge z decays for an allowed @xmath0-branch is given by :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the weak interaction coupling constant , @xmath7 is the momentum of @xmath0-particle , @xmath8 = @xmath9 is the total energy of @xmath0-particle and @xmath10 is the maximum @xmath0-particle energy .",
    "@xmath10 = @xmath11 , in @xmath12decay ( @xmath13 is the mass difference between initial and final states of neutral atoms ) .",
    "( [ pro ] ) is written in natural units ( @xmath14 ) so that the unit of momentum is @xmath15 , the unit of energy is @xmath16 , and the unit of time is @xmath17 /@xmath16 .",
    "the shape factors @xmath18 for allowed transitions which appear in eq .",
    "( [ pro ] ) are defined as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the nuclear matrix elements and the fermi functions @xmath21 .",
    "thus , for calculating the @xmath4 decay rates one needs to calculate the nuclear matrix elements and the psf , that can be defined as : @xmath22    for the allowed @xmath0 decays the fermi functions are expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the large and the small radial components of the positron radial wave functions evaluated at the nuclear radius @xmath26 which can be obtained by solving the dirac equation :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the central potential for the positron and @xmath29 is the relativistic quantum number .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) is also written in natural units .",
    "an important step in the psf calculation for @xmath4 decay is the method of obtaining the positron continuum radial functions . for this",
    "we develop a new method ( code ) of solving the dirac equation , which is adapted from the method used previously for the computation of psf for dbd process @xcite .",
    "we solved eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) in a nuclear potential @xmath30 derived from a realistic proton density distribution in the nucleus .",
    "this is done by solving the schrodinger equation with a woods - saxon potential . in this case :    @xmath31    where the charge density is    @xmath32    @xmath33 is the proton ( woods - saxon ) w.f .",
    "of the spherical single particle state @xmath34 and @xmath35 is its occupation amplitude .",
    "the factor @xmath36 reflects the spin degeneracy .",
    "the screening effect is taken into account by multiplying the expression of @xmath30 with a function @xmath37 , which is the solution of the thomas fermi equation : @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 = bohr radius .",
    "it is calculated within the majorana method @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "as mentioned above the screening effect is taken into account by a method developed in ref .",
    "the possible ways in which the screening function modifies the coulomb potential depends on the specific mechanism and its boundary conditions .    for the case of the @xmath4-decay process ,",
    "the potential used to obtain the electron w.f .",
    "is    @xmath44    to take into account the fact that @xmath0 decay releases a final negative ion with charge -1 .",
    "@xmath45 is positive . in our approach",
    ", we considered the solution of the thomas - fermi equation as a universal function , giving an effective screening . here , the product @xmath46 = 1 , for atomic units .",
    "the asymptotic potential between an positron and an ionized atom is @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", the charge number @xmath48 corresponds to the daughter nucleus , @xmath49 being the charge number of the parent nucleus .",
    "asymptotically @xmath37 tends to zero .    in this case",
    "the radial solutions of the dirac equations should be normalized in order to have the following asymptotic behavior    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the speed of the light , @xmath52 are the electron mass / energy , @xmath53 is the electron wave number , @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 for @xmath56 decays ) , is the sommerfeld parameter , @xmath57 is the phase shift and @xmath28 is the coulomb interaction energy between the electron and the daughter nucleus .    on the other side we also calculated",
    "the psf for positron decays with the method described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 functions were calculated by solving the dirac equation for a point - nucleus unscreened coulomb potential , for which the equation has analytical solutions . the finite nuclear size and screening effects were introduced as corrections , after the recipe described in @xcite .",
    "the finite size correction was introduced by means of an empirical deviation that depended on the atomic mass @xmath60 and the energy @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the screening correction was given by the following replacement @xcite : @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 was taken as a @xmath7-dependent screening potential .",
    "for further details of this formalism we refer to @xcite .",
    "no electromagnetic corrections were undertaken in this calculation of psf .",
    "electron capture is always an alternate decay mode for radioactive isotopes that do not have sufficient energy to decay by positron emission .",
    "this is a process which competes with positron decay . in order for electron",
    "capture leading to a vacancy in , say , the k - shell , the atomic mass difference between initial and final states , @xmath13 , must be greater than the binding energy of a k - shell electron in the daughter atom , @xmath66 .",
    "the energy carried off by the neutrino is then given by    @xmath67    if the energy requirement @xmath13 @xmath68 @xmath66 is satisfied , electron capture from the k - shell is more probable than that from any other shell because of the greater density at the nucleus of the k - shell electrons .",
    "the total k - shell capture rate can be expressed as    @xmath69    where @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant ( with dimensions of @xmath72 ) , the m s are specific combinations of nuclear matrix elements , @xmath73 is the large component of the bound - state radial w.f . of the captured k - shell electron ( evaluated at the nuclear surface @xmath74 ) ,",
    "@xmath75 is the neutrino energy in units of @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the `` exchange '' correction factor for the k - shell . in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) , the l - shell total capture rate will be    @xmath78    where @xmath79 denotes a particular l - subshell .",
    "the contribution of @xmath80 pertaining to the 2s@xmath81 orbital is the most important , so we keep in our calculations only the contribution of this subshell to the calculated our psf .",
    "the expressions for @xmath82 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ acr ] ) by the replacement of @xmath75 , @xmath83 by @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "electron capture from the m- , n- and higher shells may be defined in a similar fashion , but they have negligible contributions in comparison with the k- and l- ones .",
    "hence , for an allowed transition , the psf expression of electron capture within the approximation stated above , can be written as    @xmath86    for the @xmath87 quantities we used the expression    @xmath88    were , @xmath89 is the q value of the @xmath4 decay in @xmath90 units , @xmath91 are the binding energies of the 1s@xmath81 and 2s@xmath81 electron orbitals of the parent nucleus , @xmath92 their radial densities on the nuclear surface .",
    "@xmath93 represent the values of the exchange correction .",
    "these are due to an imperfect overlap of the initial and final atomic states caused by the one unit charge difference @xcite . in our method we consider these exchange corrections to be unity , for the nuclei considered , the estimated error in doing that being under 1% .",
    "the relation @xmath94 holds .",

    "we provide a grid with values of the potential for different radial distances .",

    "the w.f . is calculated step by step in the mesh points .",
    "the increment and the number of terms in the series expansion determine the accuracy of the solutions .",
    "in our calculations , the increment interval is 10@xmath117 fm and at lest 100 terms are taken into account in the series expansion .",
    "these values exceed the convergence criteria of ref .",
    "@xcite . to renormalize the numerical solutions",
    ", we made use of the fact that at very large distances , the behavior of the w.f .",

    "therefore , the the amplitudes and the the phase shifts can be extracted by comparing the numerical solution and the analytical ones . for discrete states , the asymptotic behavior of the w.f . gives a guess for the inverse solutions .",
    "the eigenvalue is obtained when the direct solutions and the inverse ones match each other .",
    "we constructed an adequate procedure to find the bound states of the electron up to an accuracy of 0.3 kev , or lower , by searching solutions up to 130 kev binding energies . in this range of energies ,",
    "all the possible bound state energies are found .",
    "we calculated the solutions starting outward from @xmath118 and inward from a very large value of the radius @xmath103 .",
    "the bound states should be obtained when both solutions are equal in an intermediate point , for the two components of the wave function .",
    "we found these energies by interpolation .",
    "we selected the radial wave functions @xmath102 and @xmath101 that have same number of nodes @xmath1190 or 1 .",
    "for the psf computation , all integrals in eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) were performed accurately with gauss - legendre quadrature in 32 points .",
    "we calculated up to 49 values of the radial functions in the q value energy interval , that were interpolated with spline functions .",
    "we also calculated the psf for ec process using eq .",
    "( [ eckl ] ) but employing essentially the formalism adopted by ref .",
    "here we used the electron radial density ( and density ratios ) as given in table  2 of @xcite .",

    "all calculations were done with the @xmath2 value indicated in @xcite .",
    "one can see that the agreement between tw results and the other results are in general under 1% , except the last two ( heaviey ) nuclei where the differences reach @xmath120 3% .    in table",
    "ii we display our psf computed with the new method for few heavy nuclei , but for which we did not find previous results . for comparison we computed the same psf values with the recipe adopted from ref .",

    "we found a rather good agreement between the two sets of result , with differences within , generally , a few percent .",
    "there was one exception , @xmath121ag , where the difference was large ( @xmath120 a factor 10 ) .",
    "this is a case where the @xmath2-value is very small ( 0.325 mev ) , and might make our numerical routine to be inaccurate at such small values .",
    "however , this discrepancy may not be so significant , as long as the calculated psf value is small enough to have little contribution to the corresponding beta decay rates    in table  iii we preset our results for ec for the same set of nuclei .",
    "the q - values for positron decay were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite for nuclei marked with @xmath122 .",

    "we compare the results performed with the new method ( tw ) with those calculated using the recipe of ref .",
    "for these transitions the differences between the two sets of results are significantly larger than for the positron decays , ranging from a few percent to about a mammoth 35% .",
    "we attribute these differences in the calculated psf values mainly due to electron densities , @xmath73 , whose values , calculated with the `` old'' and `` new'' methods , differ significantly from each other .",
    "we also checked the influence of the screening effect on the psf values .",
    "we found that while for the positron decays this effect is very small , for the ec transitions there is some differences between the `` screened '' and \" ` un - screened \" psf values .",
    "1 shows this effect on the electron density , @xmath73 and on the final psf values . for small values of @xmath60 the results without screening give psf values that are 10 - 15% larger than those listed in table iii . for heavier nuclei , these differences are only up to 2 - 3% .",
    "the screening effect in psf calculation is more important for light nuclei and lead to a decrease in the psf values up to 15% . finally , in table iv we present psf values for ec transitions , re - computed with up - dated q - values taken from ref .",
    "we propose to use these new computed values of psf for calculation of @xmath0 decay rates .",
    "in summary , we constructed a new code for computing psf values for positron decays and ec processes . in our approach",
    "we get positron free and electron bound w.f . by solving a dirac equation with a coulomb - type potential , obtained from a realistic distribution of protons in the daughter nuclei .",
    "the fns and screening effects are addressed as well by our new recipe . using the same q - values",
    ", we compare our results with previous calculations where electron / positron w.f .",
    "were obtained in an approximate way . for positron",
    "decays the agreement with older results is quite good , while for ec processes the differences between `` new '' and `` old '' psf values is as big as 35% .",
    "we further found that the screening effect is important for ec processes , specially for light nuclei , having an impact up to 10 - 15% on the calculated psf values .",
    "finally , using our new method , we re - computed the psf for all nuclei using up - dated q - values .",
    "we hope , these computed psf values will prove useful in more accurate estimations of the beta decay rates .",
    "we are currently working on the impact of newly computed psf values on @xmath0-decay half - lives and hope to report our findings in near future .",
