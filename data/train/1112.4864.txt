    "the nature of the transition from one phase to another is one of the most important problems in statistical physics and in various areas of materials science not limited to physics . since the introduction of the renormalization group @xcite with new concepts based on the system symmetry and scale , the understanding of the nature of the phase transition in many systems becomes clear . however , there are complicated systems where that method encounters much of difficulties in application",
    ". one can mention frustrated systems where competing interactions cause highly degenerate ground states with instabilities @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the phase transition in molecular crystals which has been a subject of intensive investigations since 40 years .",
    "this spectacular development was due to numerous applications of liquid crystals in daily life @xcite .",
    "liquid crystals are somewhere between solid and liquid states where molecules have some spatial orientations which , under some conditions , can order themselves into some structures such as nematic and smectic phases .",
    "liquid crystal display uses properties of these ordered phases @xcite . in spite of the large number of applications using experimental findings , theoretical understanding in many points is still desirable .",
    "one of the most important aspects of the problem is the origin of layered structures observed in smectic ordering : in smectic phases the molecules are ordered layer by layer with periodicity .",
    "experiments have discovered , for example , smectic phases of 3-layer , 4-layer , or 6-layer periodicity @xcite .",
    "different theories have been suggested to interpret these observations @xcite .",
    "one of the unanswered questions is what is the origin of the long - period layered structure in observed smectic phases ?",
    "hamaneh et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the effective long - range interaction is due to bend fluctuations of the smectic layers which may stabilize commensurate structures in particular the six - layer phase .",
    "this suggestion is too qualitative to allow a clear understanding of the long - period layered structure in smectic phases . to our opinion",
    ", we should distinguish long - range correlation and long - range interaction .",
    "we know that long - range correlation can be a consequence of short - range interactions , not necessarily of long - range ones , as it is well known in theory of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "however , a long - range correlation does not imply a particular long - period configuration .    to look for a physical origin of long - period structures ,",
    "we concentrate ourselves in the present paper to the effect of a dipolar interaction in a potts model , in addition to an exchange interaction between nearest neighbors ( nn ) .",
    "we suppose that each molecule has a molecular axis which can lie on one of the three principal directions .",
    "an example of such a molecule is the ammoniac molecule nh@xmath8 . without the dipolar interaction ,",
    "the interaction between neighboring molecules gives rise to an orientational order of molecular axes at low temperature .",
    "in this situation , the system can be described by a 3-state potts model in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "the potts model is very important in statistical physics .",
    "it is in fact a class of models each of which is defined by the number of states @xmath9 that an individual particle or molecule can have .",
    "the interaction between two neighboring molecules is negative if they are in the same state , it is zero otherwise .",
    "exact solutions are found for many potts models in two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite . in 2d ,",
    "the phase transition is of second order for @xmath10 and of first order for higher @xmath9 . in 3d , a number of points are well understood .",
    "for example , the phase transition is of first order for @xmath11 .",
    "the molecular crystal described above undergoes therefore a first - order transition in the absence of a dipolar interaction .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the dipolar interaction on the ground state ( gs ) structure and on the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the dipolar interaction is a long - range interaction which yields different gs structures depending on the shape of the sample as will be discussed in the next section . to carry out our purpose",
    ", we use a steepest descent method for the gs determination and the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation combined with the histogram technique to distinguish first- and second - order characters .    in section [ model ] , we show our model and analyze the gs . results of mc simulations are shown and discussed in section [ result ] . concluding remarks are given in section [ conclu ]",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice where each site is occupied by an axial molecule . the molecular axis can be in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 direction .",
    "let us denote the orientation of the molecule at the lattice site @xmath12 by a unit segment , not a vector , which can lie in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 direction .",
    "we attribute the potts variable @xmath13=1 , 2 or 3 when it lies in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 axes , respectively , in the calculation . by the very nature of the model shown below",
    ", the results do not depend on these numbers as in the standard @xmath9-state potts model .",
    "we suppose that the interaction energy between two nearest molecules is -@xmath0 ( @xmath14 ) if their axes are parallel , zero otherwise . with this hypothesis ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the following 3-state potts model :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the 3-state potts variable at the lattice site @xmath12 and @xmath17 is made over the nearest sites @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "the dipolar interaction between potts variables is written as @xmath19[\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma_j)\\cdot \\mathbf u_{ij}]}{r_{ij}^3}\\}\\delta ( \\sigma_i,\\sigma_j ) \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the vector of unit length connecting sites @xmath12 and @xmath21 , @xmath1 a positive constant depending on the material , @xmath22 is defined as the unit vector lying on the axis corresponding to the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the sum is limited at some cutoff distance @xmath2 . without the kronecker condition and in the case of classical xy or heisenberg",
    "spins , the dipolar interaction gives rise to spin configurations which depend on the sample shape . for example , in 2d or in rectangular slabs spins lie in the plane to minimize the system energy .",
    "let us first discuss about the gs in the potts model introduced above .",
    "when @xmath6 the gs is uniform with one orientation value , namely it is 3-fold degenerate .",
    "however , for a nonzero @xmath1 , the ground state changes with varying @xmath2 . to determine the gs",
    ", we use the steepest descent method which works very well in systems with uniformly distributed interactions .",
    "this method is very simple @xcite ( i ) we generate an initial configuration at random ( ii ) we calculate the local field created at a site by its neighbors using ( [ hl ] ) and ( [ dip ] ) ( iii ) we take the potts variable to minimize its energy ( i. e. align the `` potts spin '' in its local field ) ( iv ) we go to another site and repeat until all sites are visited : we say we make one sweep ( v ) we do a large number of sweeps per site until a good convergence is reached .",
    "we show some examples in fig .",
    "for very small @xmath1 , the gs is uniform for any @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ gs]a . for increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "the gs has layered structures with period @xmath23 ( alternate single layers ) , @xmath24 ( double layers ) , @xmath25 ( triple layers ) , ... depending on @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we note that in fig .",
    "[ gs ] there are only two kinds of molecular orientations represented by two colors ( on line ) in spite of the fact that we have three possible orientations .",
    "let us discuss about the single - layer structure shown in fig .",
    "it is very important to note that each layer has no coupling with two nearest layers whose molecules lie on another axis .",
    "however , it is coupled to two next - nearest layers of the same color , namely the same molecular axis , lying within @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the gs is composed of two interpenetrating `` independent '' subsystems .",
    "the same is true for other layered structures : in a double - layer structure molecules of the same orientation ( same color on line ) interact with each other but they are separated by a double layer of molecules of another orientation . to our knowledge , this kind of gs has never been found before .",
    "it may have important applications at macroscopic levels .",
    "note also that if the molecules of the single - layer structure are successively in @xmath3-oriented and @xmath4-oriented planes , then the stacking direction of these planes is the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the molecules can choose the @xmath3 and @xmath5 orientations or the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "in those cases the stacking directions are respectively the @xmath4 and @xmath3 directions .",
    "these three possibilities are equivalent if the sample is cubic . in rectangular shapes ,",
    "the stacking direction is along the smallest thickness .    in order to understand how such gs configurations found by the steepest descent method depend on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we have considered the structures 121212 ... (single - layer structure ) , 11221122 ...",
