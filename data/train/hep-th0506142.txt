    "<S> this short  certainly controversial  communication tries to shed some light on the historical and formalistic context of symanzik s theory in order to sharpen our ( quantum ) intuition about non - perturbative theoretical physics between ( non)triviality and asymptotic freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental laws of physics seem to follow a principle of beautiful simplicity , which challenges human imagination and intuition to the extreme . </S>",
    "<S> one example is the theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which describes nature to an extreme of accuracy , yet virtually had to be declared dead by outstanding theoreticians due to its inherent problem of `` triviality '' , i.e. the absence of interaction for infinite cut - off :    l.d .  </S>",
    "<S> landau states in 1959 @xcite : _ `` @xmath1 it was demonstrated by pomeranchuk in a series of papers that , as the cut - off limit is increased , the physical interaction tends to zero , no matter how large the bare coupling constant is . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 by now , the ` nullification ' of the theory is tacitly accepted even by theoretical physicists who profess to dispute it . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 it therefore seems to me inopportune to attempt an improvement in the rigour of pomeranchuk s proofs , especially as the brevity of life does not allow us the luxury of spending time on problems which will lead to no new results . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath1 it is very demoralizing to be a research student working on a theory which will probably lead to a trivial theory , if it leads to anything . </S>",
    "<S> this is not to say that the techniques of constructive quantum field theory should not be studied . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1''_.    </S>",
    "<S> another example is the seemingly only @xcite candidate quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite for the `` non - trivial '' theory of strong interactions , which is yet lacking conclusive experimental evidence in what concerns the reality of gluons and its interface to experimentally verifiable asymptotic states , besides theoretical accumulating arguments in favour of scalar confinement ( see for example refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and well founded , yet unsettled concerns by a distinguished lattice qcd expert  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly it has been shown for example by bender and jones @xcite using the example of @xmath0-theory that triviality ( @xmath2 ) and non - triviality ( @xmath3 ) coexist in the infinitesimal vincinity of @xmath4 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore it has been argued by for example consoli @xcite that @xmath5-theories , undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking , are aymptotically free ( see also huang @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , consoli and stevenson provide a beautiful and unexpected outline of how the non - trivial phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was as early as 1970 , when symanzik @xcite proposed an asymptotic free @xmath5-theory in the context of the restless and painful struggle towards a theory of strong interactions involving great scientists like for example  among several others  nambu and gell - mann , which is beautifully described in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and which led finally in 2004 to the well deserved nobel prize in physics honoring the contribution of gross , politzer and wilczek ( obviously performed under the strong influence of e.g.  coleman , and in the presence of complementary or foregoing related research work by scientists like e.g.  t hooft and symanzik ) _ `` @xmath1 for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction @xmath1''_. to use the words of the `` the nobel prize in physics 2004  advanced information '' @xcite :    _ `` @xmath1 experimentally verified scaling had a great impact on the physics community . </S>",
    "<S> the idea now was to understand how a physical theory could include scaling , and in 1970 kurt symanzik ( d. 1983 ) argued that only a theory with a negative so - called @xmath6-function can imply scaling ; the term ` asymptotic freedom ' was coined for this kind of theory . @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> symanzik himself discovered a quantum field theory with a negative @xmath6-function , namely one with a scalar field with a four - point interaction with a negative coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> however a theory of this kind is not well - defined , since it does not have a stable particle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1''_.    yet symanzik himself states @xcite in 1970 about his theory , which presumably stevenson called `` precarious '' @xcite , that _ </S>",
    "<S> `` @xmath1 we know of no reason why ( the renormalized ) @xmath7 should e.g. take positive rather than negative values @xmath1''_. then he writes in a manuscript _ `` a field theory with computable large - momenta behaviour '' _ received at 12.12.1972 and published at 13.1.1973 in lettere al nuovo cimento @xcite :    _  @xmath1 in the current extensive discussion of @xmath8 theory it is usually taken for granted that the renormalized coupling constant @xmath7 must be positive . as emphasized previously _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite _ there is no known reason , axiomatic or otherwise , for @xmath9 to be required for a physically acceptable theory . </S>",
    "<S> the feeling that otherwise the theory can not have a vacuum and particles of discrete mass is not rigorously founded as discussed near the end of this letter @xmath1 one must not consider , however , the @xmath10 mode as an attempt to continue the @xmath9 one to negative @xmath7 , which is certainly impossible analytically , but as an entirely different mode of @xmath8 theory @xmath1_.    in the last sentence symanzik displays a very deep understanding of the underlying formalism required to construct correctly  as done just most recently by bender @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",

    "<S> in addition to the sizable amount of `` traditional '' literature on symanzik s precarious theory ( see for example refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , there has recently developed a renewed highly topical interest in symanzik s precarious theory in the context of the relatively new research field of pt - symmetric quantum theory @xcite ( see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this field makes strong use of ideas developed in the context of quantum theories with indefinite metric ( see for example ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) and is some special case of a more general non - hermitian quantum theory , a formulation of which by the author is in progress ( see for example refs . @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we want to briefly mention here only the following important results concerning pt - symmetric quantum theory : the claim of bender and boettcher @xcite in 1998 that the class of non - hermitian , yet pt - symmetric hamilton operators @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) has  _ due to its pt - symmetry _  a _ real _ spectrum _ bound _ from below , was rigorously proven for a more general class of pt - symmetric hamilton operators in 2001 mainly on the basis of bethe - ansatz techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore it became clear that the construction of a meaningful scalar product for such hamilton operators yielding a probability interpretation and being defined on contours in the complex @xmath13-plane yields essentially a non - hermitian problem also for seemingly `` hermitian  looking '' pt - symmetric hamilton operators like the quantum - mechanical analogue of symanzik s precarious @xmath14-theory , i.e.  a @xmath15-theory ( see e.g.  refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . as a final step pt - symmetric quantum mechanics has been extended most recently @xcite to pt - symmetric quantum field theory . </S>",
