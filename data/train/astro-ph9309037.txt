    "x - ray searches in regions of recent star formation have proven efficacious not only in recovering previously known solar - type pms objects ( the classical t tauri stars or ctts ) , but in locating a class of objects of which few were previously identified , the weak line t tauri stars ( wtts ) which lack the emission phenomena ( h@xmath2 emission ; metallic line emission ; optical excess ( veiling ) and infrared excess emission ) which characterize ctts .",
    "we report in this contribution the results of a deep search for x - ray sources in the vicinity of an actively star forming cloud within the taurus - auriga cloud complex : l1495 e(ast ) .",
    "our rosat pspc image is the result of a total integration time of @xmath5s and is centered on v410 tau .",
    "we had originally hoped to use these data to search for periodic variations in x - ray flux from v410 tau .",
    "however the exposure did not span a large enough fraction of the 1.88 day rotation period to provide a definite result .",
    "the long effective integration time did permit a search for sources with x - ray luminosities as faint as @xmath6 ergs / s ( unreddened ) , @xmath7 times deeper than any previous x - ray exposure in this region . as a result we located a number of additional candidate pms stars ( 8 in number , compared to a previously identified pms population of 12 objects in the same area ) .",
    "the goals of this study are ( 1 ) to locate optical counterparts for the newly identified sources ; ( 2 ) to locate these objects in the hr diagram using red spectra and optical and near infrared photometry ; ( 3 ) to determine masses , ages and disk frequency for these objects ; and ( 4 ) to construct an imf for this population .",
    "large scale studies of the l1495 molecular cloud have been published by duvert , cernicharo & baudry ( 1986 ) and fukui et al .",
    "these maps were made with radio telescopes of 2.5 m and 4 m diameter and therefore of relatively low spatial resolution ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however both maps show that the greatest concentration of molecular material is centered on the region containing v410 tau , v892 tau , dd tau and cz tau , the region upon which our rosat pspc image is centered .",
    "unfortunately , the region has not yet been studied either at high spatial resolution or in molecules sensitive to high densities ( e.g. nh@xmath9 ) .",
    "most molecular studies have been concentrated in the less dense western part of this cloud . in view of the youth of this region and the degree of star forming activity",
    ", it would be of great interest to pursue such studies .",
    "recent observations with the nagoya university radio telescope , centered on known pms objects show that the velocity dispersion as measured by line widths in this part of l1495 is larger than that seen in any other part of the taurus - auriga clouds , @xmath103 km / s .",
    "the velocity dispersion drops considerably ( to 1 - 1.5 km / s ) in the outer parts of the cloud . in the western star forming center of l1495 ( centered on v773 tau )",
    "the velocity dispersion is @xmath11 km / s .",
    "duvert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) attributed the measured velocity dispersion to multiple components with a cloud collision possibly underway",
    ". however , while some of the line profiles appear to have weak additional components , the line profiles at cloud center appear to be smooth gaussians with fwhm of @xmath12 km / s .",
    "the mass of l1495e , within the region covered by the rosat pspc image , lies between 180 @xmath13 as determined from the nagoya c@xmath14o map and 230 @xmath13 as determined from the @xmath15co map ( ohnishi & mizuno 1993 )    within a circle of 1@xmath16 radius surrounding v410 tau there are 19 known pms objects ; 12 of these lie within a circle of 25@xmath16 radius centered in the rosat field .",
    "there is one herbig ae / be star , v892 tau ( elias 1 ) , centrally located in the cloud ; also located in the central region are 5 wtts , 3 ctts and 3 heavily embedded class i sources ( lada 1987 ) , one of which is known to drive a jet seen in h@xmath2 and [ ] ( strom et al.1986 , goodrich 1993 ) . in the outer region , 30  @xmath17  r  @xmath17  55 , there are 4 ctts and 3 wtts . while m type stars are known among this population , they are all _ early _ m stars ( spectral types m2 or earlier ) .",
    "this region of the taurus clouds thus exhibits the spectral type distribution characteristic of the rest of the taurus clouds which show an apparent deficiency of late m stars , spectral types later than m2 ( cohen & kuhi 1979 ) , and therefore an apparent deficiency of stars with masses @xmath18 .",
    "the x - ray observation of the l1495e cloud was obtained in pointing mode with the rosat telescope using the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , between @xmath19 on 1991 mar . 4 ut and @xmath20 on 1991 aug .",
    "2 ut . the total observation time over this period was 32986s . a description of the satellite , the telescope and the detector are given by trmper ( 1983 ) and pfeffermann et al .  ( 1986 ) .",
    "because a portion of the data included in the standard analysis ( sass , version 5 - 6 ) contained observations taken during a period when the satellite was rolling ( as indicated by the `` housekeeping '' data ) the observation was rereduced excluding data taken during this period ; the effective observation time is 25757s .",
    "the data were rereduced , excluding the portion affected by satellite roll , and analyzed using the pros package ( versions 2.1 and 2.2 ) under iraf .    the optical photometry at r and",
    "i was obtained on the night of 1992 dec 11 ut with a tektronix 2048x2048 ccd mounted in a universal ccd dewar on the kitt peak national observatory 0.9 m telescope by patrick hartigan .",
    "the plate scale for the camera / telescope combination used for this observation was 0775/px .",
    "a series of exposure times ranging from 10s through 300s was used for observations at i in order to obtain unsaturated images of the bright stars .",
    "a single exposure at r of 30s duration was made .",
    "only 2 stars suffered from saturated images in this exposure . since the field was not crowded , the photometry was reduced using the digiphot package in iraf using the new landolt standard fields ( landolt 1992 ) and the photcal routine ( davis 1993 ) .",
    "the near infrared photometry was obtained during 4 different runs due to the convolved effects of the small size of infrared arrays and the terrible weather in arizona during the winter of 1993 .",
    "the largest batch of near infrared observations was taken by ronald probst on the night of 1993 jan 12 ut using the sqiid photometer on the 1.3 m telescope at kpno .",
    "simultaneous images in j , h , and k were obtained using 256 x 256 ptsi arrays over a field of dimension @xmath21 x @xmath21 ; the size of each pixel is 136 .",
    "each image is the sum of 2 `` dithered '' images , offset by @xmath22 with an integration time of 180s apiece .",
    "one additional field was obtained by lynne hillenbrand and the authors on 1992 dec 27 ut , again with sqiid on the 1.3 m telescope at kpno . the field centered on v892 tau ( elias 1 )",
    "was observed on 1992 jan 27 ut with this same instrumentation by the authors .",
    "these data were all reduced using the sqiid package under iraf .",
    "a few additional single channel photometer measurements collected for other programs at san pedro martir are also included .",
    "one additional field , as well as 2 previously observed fields , were observed by michael meyer and patricia knesek on 1993 march 11 ut at the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at the mdm observatory on kitt peak using the nicmass camera , equipped with a 256 x 256 hgcdte nicmos array having a field of dimension @xmath23 x @xmath23 , and a plate scale of @xmath24/px .",
    "a series of four 3s integrations in each filter was followed by a series of four 10s integrations .",
    "these data were also reduced using the sqiid package under iraf .",
    "spectra were obtained with hydra , the fiber optic coupled spectrograph on the 4 m telescope at kpno .",
    "we used the red fiber cable in conjunction with the bl181 grating ( 316 l / mm ) set at a central wavelength of 7600 , and a tektronix 2048x2048 ccd to obtain spectra with a usable range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ; the effective resolution was @xmath273 pixels or 6 .",
    "the spectra were then reduced using the dohydra package within iraf .",
    "further analysis was done using the onedspec package .",
    "spectral standards were established using the main sequence proper motion members of praesepe ( jones & stauffer 1991 ) for spectral types between f6 and m4 .",
    "these standards were supplemented by the spectra of kirkpatrick , henry & mccarthy ( 1991 ) for the late m stars .",
    "our deep rosat pspc exposure centered on v410  tau allows us to assess the completeness of the known pre - main sequence stellar population in this nearby active star formation region , of which only the periphery was observed with the _ einstein _ satellite .",
    "the pre - rosat surveys do not provide the basis for evaluating the number of very low mass stars ( @xmath28 ) in this region , leaving the question of the population of the low mass end of the imf unaddressed . some information is provided by extant h@xmath2 surveys and the lkca survey .",
    "this part of the taurus clouds was covered by the herbig , vrba & rydgren ( 1986 ) survey for stars exhibiting ca  ii h & k emission and three such stars ( lkca 4 , 5 , & 7 ) were found within the field of this rosat observation .",
    "these stars exhibit h@xmath2 emission and strong @xmath29 absorption ( strom et al .",
    "1989a , walter et al . 1988 ) and are clearly pre - main sequence objects .",
    "however their h@xmath2 emission equivalent widths are too small to allow detection by h@xmath2 objective prism surveys .",
    "unfortunately , both the h@xmath2 and emission line surveys reach only the brighter stars in the taurus clouds ( r @xmath30 13 ) , and are incomplete for fainter stars , usually locating only those faint stars with unusually strong h@xmath2 emission .    our deep rosat pspc image of the v410 tau region should enable a deep search for faint pre - main sequence stars based on the elevated x - ray luminosity characteristic of pms stars .",
    "relative to main sequence stars of the same spectral type , the x - ray luminosities of pms stars may be @xmath31 times greater ( feigelson 1986 , strom et al .",
    "both ctts and wtts are strong x - ray emitters , with no significant difference in the x - ray properties of the two groups ( feigelson & kriss , strom et al .",
    "1990 , gauvin & strom 1992 ) .",
    "our observation should allow us to detect lightly obscured stars at the distance of the taurus clouds ( 160 pc ) having x - ray luminosities a factor of 20 lower than those found with the _ einstein _ observations .",
    "unfortunately the sensitivity of a rosat pspc observation is not uniform across the field .",
    "the point spread function of the rosat pspc is a strong nonlinear function of the distance from field center , varying from fwhm @xmath32 at field center to @xmath33 at @xmath34 from field center to @xmath35 at the edge of the @xmath36 field ; therefore the sensitivity decreases rapidly outside the central 25@xmath16 of the field .",
    "all but 3 ( ck tau 1 , psc04154 + 2823 , psc 04158 + 2805 ) of the 12 previously identified pre - main sequence stars ( herbig & bell 1988 ) within the central field of radius @xmath37 were easily detected .",
    "there is a faint extension on the x - ray image of hubble 4 that may be attributable to ck tau 1 . in the outer annulus",
    "@xmath38 6 more previously identified members ( ry tau , bp tau , hde 283572 , fo tau , lkca 4 , lkca 7 ) of the taurus cloud population are found .",
    "one of the previously known pms stars , fo tau , is not detected in this exposure .",
    "it is located at a distance @xmath39 from the field center .",
    "while other pms stars were detected at a distance from field center almost this great , ( notably ry tau and hde 283572 at @xmath40 ) , the much lower luminosity of fo tau apparently precludes its detection .",
    "in addition to the previously known members of the pms population , eight additional x - ray detections ( @xmath41 ) appear in the central region of our exposure , which is centered on the densest part of the dark cloud .",
    "the positions of the previously known pms stars are offset from the x - ray positions derived from the standard analysis by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . using these offsets as a template",
    ", we were able to identify optical counterparts for each of the new x - ray sources on our deep i band ccd frame . within the positional error given by the local x - ray point spread function ( @xmath44 )",
    ", 6 sources ( v410 x - ray 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , & 7 ) appear to have unique optical counterparts while only two sources ( v410 x - ray 5 & 8) within the central region of the field had more than one optical object as a possible identification .",
    "the object farthest from field center ( v410 x - ray 8 , r = 185 ) is located near the cloud periphery , hence complicating the identification owing to increasing contamination by background field stars . in this case",
    "we examined 6 possible identifications .",
    "although most of these 6 candidates are much too far from the x - ray position , we felt that the possibility that the brightest star of the 6 , x - ray 8a , was the true x - ray source should be explored .",
    "the positional information for the sources detected in our rosat observation , as well as for the other pms objects in the field , are presented in table 1 .",
    "the table gives the object name , the optical position , the x - ray position , the difference between the x - ray and optical positions in the sense x - ray minus optical , and the radial distance from field center .",
    "a finding chart is given in figure 1 ( plate xx ) .",
    "for each detected x - ray photon , the time of arrival , position and energy are recorded .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the variability of the source and to fit its spectral energy distribution with models which take into account both extinction from the intervening interstellar medium and the source temperature . assuming that the x - ray emission from each of these sources arises in a stellar corona , we model the observed spectrum with a raymond - smith ( raymond & smith 1977 ) thermal plasma , assuming solar abundances",
    "we then solved for the temperature of the plasma and the column density of hydrogen atoms along the line of sight assuming the morrison - mccammon ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) interstellar x - ray absorption model . for the brighter x - ray sources ,",
    "the signal to noise was sufficiently high to note strong systematic behavior in the fit residuals .",
    "where appropriate , these sources were then refit with a two temperature model ( schrijver , lemen & mewe 1989 ) where the line of sight extinction was held constant but two components of different temperature were included in the fit .",
    "these models provided substantially better fits ( the @xmath45 values were improved by factors of 5 to 35 ) to the x - ray spectra of the brighter sources .",
    "single component models were used for the fainter sources .",
    "the results of these fits for all stars are given in table 2 .",
    "examples of the fits obtained for two high signal to noise sources ( v410 tau and hubble 4 ) with different line of sight extinctions are shown in figure 2 .",
    "also shown are the @xmath46 plots in the temperature-@xmath47 plane .",
    "these plots demonstrate the sensitivity of the fits to line of sight extinction , even when the count rate is high . using these fits ,",
    "we are then able to calculate extinction corrected x - ray luminosities ( 0.2 - 2.4 kev ) for these sources .",
    "when line of sight extinction is sufficiently high that few low energy photons are detected , the error in the temperature determination increases , sometimes substantially .",
    "the two temperature model serves only as an approximation to the more likely situation of a continuous temperature distribution .",
    "therefore we feel that the presentation of formal error bars for the temperature and emission measure values would not be physically meaningful .",
    "higher spectral resolution is necessary in order to make more physically meaningful measurements of the temperature distribution found in the region where the x - ray emission is formed .",
    "for sources with too few counts to yield a reliable fit , a model with @xmath48 and @xmath49 kev was fit in order to allow an estimate of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "we can compare the distribution of x - ray luminosities of the newly discovered x - ray objects with those of the previously identified pms population of l1495e .",
    "the distributions of the 2 populations are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is obvious that , while the _ range _ in x - ray luminosity for the 2 groups is similar , the _ distributions _ are vastly different .",
    "the median x - ray luminosity for the previously identified population is @xmath50 30.26 ; the median x - ray luminosity for the newly identified population is @xmath50 29.00 .",
    "therefore , by substantially increasing our sensitivity to low luminosity sources , we have demonstrated that _ pms _ stars may have x - ray luminosities at least as low as those found for pleiades _",
    "main sequence _ stars of solar type ( stauffer et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "while it was hoped that this observation would cover a full rotation period of v410 tau , scheduling constraints led to the coverage of only @xmath51 of the period of this star .",
    "v410 tau shows clear evidence of high amplitude variation .",
    "we were unable to comment definitively on the relationship between the x - ray light curve and that seen in the optical .",
    "however we are able to extract variability data for each of our detected objects on shorter timescales because the arrival time of each detected photon is recorded as part of the observation .",
    "the kolgomorov - smirnov and cramer - von mises tests for constancy were performed on the time sorted event files for the brighter sources in this field .",
    "nine of the 12 sources bright enough to yield reliable results demonstrate clear variability .",
    "these results are also tabulated in table 2 where we list the probability of variability found for the sources examined as well as the ratio of the maximum count rate to the minimum count rate seen in an 860s bin .",
    "the large number of x - ray variables is not surprising in light of the extreme variability already noted for some of the pms sources in the _ einstein _ observations ( montmerle et al .",
    "1983 , feigelson & decampli 1981 ) .",
    "none of the 8 newly discovered x - ray sources in l1495e was sufficiently bright to enable reliable variability indications .",
    "at least one , and possibly 2 , x - ray flares occurred on pms stars within the field during the observation period ( figure 4 ) .",
    "dd  tau clearly flared during the second half of the observation period following a long period of very low x - ray flux .",
    "unfortunately , owing to a gap in the observation , we are unable to determine the rise time of the flare . the emission at the peak of the flare was a factor of 15 higher than that seen prior to the flare .",
    "the e - folding time for the decay of the flare is @xmath271 hour ; however the star remained a factor of 2 above the flux level of its previous quiesent stage more than 5 hours after the flare began , at the end of the observation .",
    "it is possible that a less extreme event was seen on hde 283572 . here",
    "the rise time is @xmath52 hours and the decay time is @xmath53 hours . the peak flux is @xmath53 times the pre - event flux .",
    "another interpretation of the hde 283572 observation would be that we are seeing variability associated with the rotation of an active region on the surface of the star .",
    "the rotation period of this star is @xmath54 hours ( 1.55d ) ( walter et al .",
    "1988 ) ; therefore our observation covered 0.65 periods .",
    "lacking more data , we are unable to determine which interpretation is more likely .",
    "we have obtained new cousins r and i band ccd observations of the central region of the rosat field , as well as new near infrared ( j , h , and k ) observations of the x - ray sources in the same region . these data are presented in table 3 . when multiple observations have been made , the epoch is also given .",
    "we were also able to obtain classification spectra in the red region for most of the possible x - ray source identifications ( see figure 1 ) with the hydra fiber optic fed spectrograph . because of restrictions imposed by the placement of the optical fibers in the focal plane of the telescope , when a choice had to be made between two or more objects , the more likely identification ( the brightest star nearest the x - ray position ) was chosen .",
    "for this reason , no spectra were obtained of v410 x - ray 5b , v410 x - ray 8b and c. although fibers were placed on v410 x - ray 2 and 4 , no usable spectra were obtained owing to the faintness of the stars .",
    "no spectrum was obtained for dd  tau on this run .",
    "the spectral type for this star was taken from hartigan , strom & strom ( 1994 ) .",
    "the spectral type for cz tau is a compromise since there is a definite change of spectral type with wavelength of at least 2 spectral subclasses , with later spectral types being found at longer wavelengths .",
    "this does not appear to be due to a variable veiling contribution , but is perhaps due to contamination of the spectrum with light from the subarcsecond companion found by leinert et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "observations of the praesepe main sequence stars were used as spectral standards with which to classify our spectra of the x - ray sources in l1495e .",
    "the spectral types obtained are also given in table 3 ; the spectral types should be good to 1 spectral subclass earlier that m2 and @xmath16 a spectral subclass for stars later than m2 . while the resolution of the spectra are too low to enable measurement of the strength of the li @xmath55 line , it was possible to measure the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line , thus providing another criterion for including the star as a candidate member of the pms population .",
    "these values are presented in table 3 as well .",
    "because there were 97 fibers available for placement upon stars or sky positions when using the hydra spectrograph , we chose to place some of these fibers upon anonymous stars that fell within the area of the l1495e cloud .",
    "we obtained usable spectra for 5 of these stars , optical photometry for these 5 , and , coincidentally , near infrared photometry for 4 of the stars .",
    "this data is also given in table 3 .",
    "other anonymous stars appeared in our infrared imaging frames .",
    "data for these stars is also given in the appendix .",
    "on the basis of the data tabulated in table 3 , we can assess the likelihood that we have properly identified the stellar x - ray sources and compare the distribution of the spectral types of the newly identified stars with that of the previously identified population .",
    "we must first evaluate the extinction suffered by each star .",
    "the spectral type and observed r - i color give a color excess for each star , e(r - i ) , which , when combined with a standard reddening law , yields the extinction .",
    "these values are also tabulated in table 3 .    among the candidate",
    "objects for identification with the x - ray sources , only the spectrum for v410 x - ray 8a clearly disqualifies it as a member of the cloud population .",
    "the spectral type of v410 x - ray 8a is m0 - 2 iii .",
    "this spectral type combined with the available photometry indicates substantial extinction .",
    "since the object lies near the cloud edge , it is likely that we are viewing the star through a substantial path length of the l1495 cloud ; the luminosity classification of this spectrum clearly identifies the star as a background giant .",
    "the positional discrepancy with the x - ray source location is also much too large to be acceptable .",
    "therefore the x - ray source is most likely associated with the h@xmath2 emission object x - ray 8e , although we have no spectrum for x - ray 8d which lies marginally closer to the x - ray position .",
    "the spectrum of v410 x - ray 8e indicates that this star is heavily veiled with a spectral type near m4 or possibly later . due to the veiling and the approximate spectral type",
    ", the reddening is poorly determined .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is very broad .",
    "the spectra of all of the other x - ray candidate objects exhibit h@xmath2 in emission and m type spectra .    among the anonymous stars for which we have obtained spectra ,",
    "there are 4 m type stars .",
    "one of these stars , v410 anon 13 , clearly shows significant extinction , indicating that it can not be a foreground star .",
    "this star has an h@xmath2 emission equivalent width of 22 indicating that it is most likely a member of the cloud population of pms stars .",
    "the other 3 m stars show little or no extinction ( @xmath56 ) and little , if any , h@xmath2 emission ( @xmath57 ) ; therefore they are likely to be foreground m dwarfs .",
    "the fifth star is an a2 star , showing no h@xmath2 emission , and a large extinction , 10.45 mag . at v.",
    "the strength of the triplet at 7774 is consistent with the spectral type found from the h@xmath2 line profile and a luminosity class of v - iii .",
    "the h@xmath2 profile indicates a main sequence star . at a galactic latitude of @xmath5815.5 and a galactic longitude of 168.7 , only 0.1 a iii stars",
    "/@xmath59 are expected within the volume formed by the cloud size and the distance to the star were it a giant .",
    "this star is thus most likely a main sequence a star at or close to the cloud distance .",
    "we can now examine the distribution of spectral types for the previously identified cloud population and compare it with that found for the newly identified population .",
    "this is shown in figure 5 .",
    "clearly the _ newly discovered cloud members include a much larger number of later type stars _ , indicating that previous studies greatly undersampled the lowest mass pms stars .",
    "we can also examine the distribution of reddening values within the 2 groups as shown in figure 6 .",
    "the reddening values in the previously identified population are heavily weighted toward low values with a median at 1.25 mag .",
    "the median value for the newly identified population is 3.80 mag . indicating that a major reason for the absence of these stars from previous surveys is the relatively large extinction associated with these intrinsically faint objects .      in figure 7",
    "we present the near infrared color - color diagram for the stars in table 3 .",
    "the solid lines show the locus of the main sequence and of the giant branch .",
    "the dashed lines show the bounds of the region within which reddened main sequence stars may fall .",
    "stars lying to the right of this region show definite evidence for excess emission believed to arise from circumstellar accretion disks .",
    "stars lying between these lines may still possess accretion disks .",
    "however it is impossible to distinguish such stars from reddened main sequence stars or reddened wtts in this diagram . also shown on the lower and left axes of this figure are the marginal distributions of all of the data for these sources .",
    "this allows us to also indicate the locations for objects too red to have measurements at all 3 wavelengths and allows quick evalution of the distribution of points in each color ( tufte 1983 ) .    we may also obtain a measure of the extinction suffered by each star from this diagram",
    "this is useful , both as a consistency check with the optical and x - ray data , and to provide extinction estimates for objects for which we have no other extinction measure .",
    "weak line t tauri stars successfully deredden back to the main sequence in this diagram , using the extinction derived from the optical region photometry .",
    "however ctts define a different sequence when the reddening is derived from their optical colors in the red region and high signal to noise spectra are used to assign spectral types ( strom , strom & merrill 1993 ) . those stars which we are able to clearly assign to one of these 2 classes we deredden to the appropriate sequence .",
    "we derive extinctions for the remaining stars , assuming that all of these stars are wttss .",
    "this procedure overestimates the extinctions for those stars which are actually ctts owing to the fact that such stars have intrinsic excess emission arising in circumstellar accretion disks . for most stars ,",
    "the extinctions determined by each of these methods are in reasonable agreement .",
    "extinctions derived in this way are used only for the 4 objects in table 3 lacking optical photometry and/or spectral types .",
    "the derived values are given in table 4 .",
    "we can see from this diagram that most of the candidates for identification with the x - ray sources are clearly pms stars exhibiting the excess infrared emission characteristic of circumstellar accretion disks .",
    "the three apparently most heavily reddened objects are two of the x - ray discovered sources and iras psc04154 + 2823 . the only candidate for identification with v410 x - ray 8 which clearly exhibits disk emission is x - ray 8e ; it is the object which also has the smallest positional discrepancy and which exhibits broad h@xmath60 emission",
    ". the infrared colors of v410 anon 13 also are in agreement with assignment to cloud membership based on its observed infrared excess .",
    "the other reddened serendipitous source , v410 anon 9 , is also a possible cloud member .",
    "this star has a spectral type of a2 and an inferred extinction of 10.45 magnitudes at v. kim ( 1990 ) detected this star in his near infrared survey and placed it in his definite pms group from its location in the infrared color - color diagram .",
    "while our colors are little different from his ( @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ) , we feel that this star can deredden naturally to the appropriate colors for its spectral type , given the errors in the photometry , although excess infrared emission can not be ruled out .",
    "there is no reflection nebula associated with this star and there is no emission at h@xmath63 .",
    "therefore it is not certain whether this star is associated with l1495e .",
    "one of the major goals of the study of a young star formation region is to place the stars in the hr diagram to estimate the masses of the stars and their approximate ages in order to determine the rate of star formation versus time in the region . with mass estimates for the stars",
    ", we can calculate the star formation efficiency of the molecular cloud and compare the local imf to that observed in the field .",
    "the data in table 3 enable us to locate the population of l1495e in the hr diagram .    from our knowledge of the components of the spectral energy distributions of t tauri stars ( bertout , basri , and bouvier 1988 , hartigan et al.1992 ) , we know that the maximum contribution of the stellar photosphere to the spectral energy distribution is made at wavelengths near @xmath64 m",
    ". flux variations due to rotational modulation are also small at these wavelengths ( vrba et al",
    ".  1986 , bouvier & bertout 1989 ) .",
    "therefore we will choose to use the flux at i or j as our measure of the stellar photospheric flux .",
    "when data at j are available , j is preferred .",
    "we must still estimate the amount of extinction for each star , although we have minimized the importance of extinction corrections by working this far to the red .",
    "the spectral type and r@xmath58i color yield a color excess for each star , e(r@xmath58i )  =  1.4  @xmath65 , which , when combined with a standard reddening law , becomes an extinction at the chosen wavelength , i or j ( @xmath65  =  0.46  @xmath66  =  0.28  @xmath67 ) . using the bolometric corrections of bessell & brett ( 1988 )",
    ", we find that the bolometric correction at i varies rapidly as a function of spectral type beyond m0 , while the variation at j is slow and monotonic over the entire spectral range of interest .",
    "therefore we will use the j magnitude , whenever possible , ( corrected for extinction , distance ( m - m = 5.88 ) and bolometric correction ) as our measure of the stellar luminosity .",
    "using the temperature - spectral type calibration of hartigan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) compiled from the work of bessel & brett ( 1988 ) and schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) , we derive an effective temperature for each star for which we have a spectrum .",
    "the errors in placement of stars in the hr diagram vary with spectral type .",
    "they can be estimated by using the values given below for two spectral types .",
    "@xmath68    @xmath69    however , the sometimes large light variations of pms stars prove to be the largest source of random error in the placement of these stars in the hr diagram ( hartigan et al .",
    "1994 ) . this can be seen immediately in table 3 where where our 2 observations of v410 x - ray 1 differ by more than a magnitude at j and of v410 x - ray 3 differ by more than 0.5 magnitude .",
    "there are multiple sources for the variability exhibited by pms stars .",
    "rotational periods have been determined for many pms stars by observation of the spot modulation of their light curves .",
    "the amplitude of this variation may be as small as a few hundreths of a magnitude or as large as 1 magnitude ( at v ) ( aa tau , vrba et al .",
    "these stars are also known to have an irregular component to their variability with very large amplitudes sometimes exceeding several magnitudes ( herbig and bell 1988 ) .",
    "these irregular fluctuations are presumed to be due to variations in the accretion rate through the disks of these stars ( kenyon et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the extreme case , an fu ori event may cause a rise of more than 5 magnitudes over a relatively short period of time ( weeks ) with a much longer decay time ( years ) ( hartmann , kenyon and hartigan 1993 ) .",
    "hartigan et al . (",
    "1994 ) found that the error in placment of pms stars in the hr diagram was dominated by the variability of these stars .",
    "they estimated that variability was responsible for @xmath70 in @xmath71 although there is a long tail at higher amplitudes to the distribution .",
    "when all of the possible sources of error are combined in quadature , the result is a `` typical '' @xmath72 uncertainty of 0.08 in @xmath71 .",
    "the data placing each of our stars in the hr diagram is given in table 4 and they are plotted in figure 5 with the @xmath73 yr isochrone from the dantona & mazzitelli(1993 ) evolution tracks . the objects v410 x - ray 2 , 4 , psc04154 + 2823 and psc04158 + 2805 are placed in the hr diagram using the ( uncertain ) extinctions estimated from their near infrared colors , a bolometric correction and effective temperature assuming they are middle m stars similar to the other objects found in this sample . for v410 anon 3 & 17 ,",
    "for which there was no near infrared photometry , we used i as the standard wavelength .",
    "the final luminosities for the 5 objects known to be binaries are then corrected for the light contributed by any secondary star discovered by high spatial resolution observations ( see section 5.3 ) .",
    "these final values are given in the column l(j@xmath74 ) .",
    "it is obvious from figure 8 that the stellar population of l1495e is very young .",
    "however , it is difficult to evaluate exactly how young and how coeval this population is because different sets of `` modern '' evolutionary tracks ( dantona & mazzitelli 1993 , swenson et al .",
    "1993 ) show sufficient differences to make interpretation difficult .",
    "also , the isochrones are in intervals of @xmath75 age ; therefore the stars are evolving very rapidly in the upper part of the hr diagram and more slowly as they age . in figure 9",
    "we show the data for these stars plotted on a ) the dantona & mazzitelli tracks using the alexander opacities and the canuto and mazzitelli convection formulation ; and b ) the swenson et al .  tracks .",
    "it is clear that , for stars this young ( @xmath76 yrs ) the tracks differ sufficiently to influence our estimate of coevality as well as the `` absolute '' age . on the dantona & mazzitelli tracks , for stars with masses less than 0.5 @xmath13",
    ", the population appears approximately coeval with an age of @xmath77yrs . using a program written by patrick hartigan which interpolates between the isochrones to assign an age to each star",
    ", we find that 20 of the 22 low mass pms stars , excluding those viewed by scattered light ( see later in this section , and the anonymous stars , have ages @xmath78 years . on the swenson et al.tracks , for the same mass range , the apparent age increases as the mass decreases and the mean age for the l1495e population is @xmath79yrs .",
    "given the uncertainties in the model isochrones and the fact that the models are still sensitive to initial conditions at these early ages , this group can be considered coeval to within @xmath80myr .",
    "the two apparently older stars merit discussion .",
    "we have only one complete set of colors for fq tau .",
    "however , at the time of the leinert et al .",
    "( 1992 ) speckle observations , fq tau was more than 0.5 mag .",
    "brighter at k than when we observed the star . if this brightness change is also reflected at j",
    ", this star is then @xmath81 above the mean age for the group .",
    "the remaining star lies 3.75@xmath82 above the mean age of the group ; this is not unreasonable for a sample this size .",
    "one possible problem apparent from both sets of tracks is the gradually increasing age found for stars with masses @xmath83 . while ry tau and hde 283572 lie off the face of the cloud , v892 tau ( elias 1 ) is heavily embedded in the cloud core and illuminates a reflection nebula .",
    "it is difficult to believe , given the apparent velocity dispersion of l1495e of @xmath84 km / s , or 3.0 pc@xmath85 yr , that this star is over @xmath86 yrs old as the tracks imply . a star formed in the center of the cloud would have moved more than @xmath87 away from the cloud center in @xmath86 yrs .",
    "the motion of this star would have to be aligned within 10@xmath16 of the line of sight and be moving away from us in order to remain located in cloud center and still exhibit an extinction of 9 mag .",
    "the only alternative ( other than suspecting a systematic error in the tracks ) is that the age of this star is correct and that star formation actually began @xmath88yr ago . in this case",
    "the timescale for `` building '' a star via infall and accretion , before it appears on these tracks , would have to be much longer for low mass stars .    from examination of figures 8 and 9 and table 4",
    ", several objects deserve special mention .",
    "there are two members of the previously identified pms population that fall well below the main body of the distribution .",
    "the images of these objects , ck tau 1 and psc 04158 + 2805 , appear definitely extended on our deep r and i frames , the psc object appearing triangular and the object near hubble 4 appearing flamelike ( figure 10 ) .",
    "we suspect that we are not seeing these objects directly but instead via light scattered through a circumstellar envelope or from nearby molecular cloud material .",
    "recent submillimeter observations of low luminosity embedded sources in the taurus region ( barsony & kenyon 1992 ) indicate very large extinctions for these sources , ( 50 @xmath89 600 ) , sufficient to render them undetectable even at @xmath90 . however these objects are nevertheless visible in the near infrared and sometimes at even shorter wavelengths .",
    "this paradox can be resolved if the density distribution surrounding these objects is highly asymmetric .",
    "models of sources such as these using asymmetric density distributions have been developed recently by kenyon , calvet & hartmann ( 1993 ) and kenyon et al.(1993 ) .",
    "these authors find it necessary to introduce a bipolar hole in the density distribution in order to reproduce both the observed spectral energy distributions and the extended images of such sources .",
    "both the spectral energy distributions and direct images of the objects shown in figure 10 are very similar to those represented by these models .",
    "the ( r@xmath58i ) colors of these objects indicate 5 - 10 magnitudes of extinction . however , the models of kenyon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , while only calculated for the j , h , & k bands , suggest that the actual extinction that should be applied to the observed magnitudes could be a factor of 3 or more higher than that inferred from the observed near infrared colors",
    ". the discrepancy should be even greater for extinctions determined from the r - i color .",
    "the visible and near infrared light is due to scattering and not transmission , and therefore the anomalous location of these stars in the hr diagram can easily be accounted for by an underestimate of the extinction .",
    "our spectral type for ck tau 1 is uncertain as the spectrum appears heavily veiled and contains strong emission lines of h , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] among others .",
    "this contributes a major source of error in the reddening estimate as we are probably not measuring photospheric colors .",
    "our previously published images of ck tau 1 in h@xmath63 ( strom et al .",
    "1986 ) indicated a faint bipolar jet emanating from this star .",
    "the recent narrow band imaging by goodrich ( 1993 ) confirms this result , showing a bipolar jet clearly in the [ s  ii ] images .    among the x - ray",
    "discovered sources in this cloud , it is clear that v410 x - ray 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5a , 6 , 7 , and 8e are member of the pms population of l1495e . in most cases they are the only possible optical object which could be identified with the x - ray source .",
    "the near infrared colors of these objects indicate excess infrared emission . when we have spectra for these objects , h@xmath63 appears in emission ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "as discussed previously , x - ray 8a is a background m giant seen through the edge of the cloud .",
    "we can make no statement about the possible association of v410 x - ray 8b , 8c , 8d , 8f and 5b since we have no spectra for those objects .    of the serendipitously observed stars , v410 anon 3 , 12 & 17 show little or no extinction or h@xmath63 emission .",
    "their derived luminosities ( at the distance of the taurus clouds ) place them above the main sequence .",
    "however they are more likely _",
    "main _ sequence stars in front of the cloud .",
    "the galactic model ( bahcall and soneria 1980 ) predicts @xmath27 10 m stars between us and the taurus clouds projected on the central region of the cloud ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the other two serendipitously observed stars may well be members of the cloud population .",
    "v410 anon 13 has an h@xmath63 emission equivalent width of @xmath93 and an inferred extinction of 2.75 magnitudes at v. this star is clearly a strong candidate for inclusion in this young group .",
    "the lack of detection in the rosat image is probably due to its low luminosity , below that of any of the x - ray detected objects .",
    "the star v410",
    "anon  9 , discussed previously , appears to be a normal a2 star with no h@xmath2 emission .",
    "when dereddened and placed at the distance of the taurus clouds , the star lies just above the main sequence , not far below v892 tau .",
    "it is possible that this star lies behind the cloud , but it can not lie far behind because the probability of finding an a giant this far above the galactic plane is small .      while we have approximately doubled the previously known population within the central region of l1495e , all with m stars , it is still possible that even more low mass stars may be hidden as secondaries in binary systems .",
    "fortunately there has been much recent high spatial resolution work which allows us to evaluate this possibility ( ghez 1993 , simon et al.1992 , leinert et al .",
    "1992 , simon 1992 , ghez , neugebauer & matthews 1992 ) .    of the previously identified pms sample ( 19 stars ) ,",
    "7 are known to be binaries ( v410 tau , dd tau , cz tau , v892 tau , fo tau , fq tau , and lkca 7 ) .",
    "eight stars were found to be single at the separations , flux ratios ( and sometimes position angles ) to which the measurements were sensitive .",
    "four stars ( ck tau 1 , psc04154 + 2823 , psc04158 + 2805 and lkca 5 ) were not examined .",
    "v892 tau was discovered to be a binary by thornley et al .",
    "( 1989 ) using near infrared imaging , the secondary was later confirmed by skinner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in their vla observations of this region .",
    "they detected both v892 tau and its close companion to the ne as well as ck tau 1 and hubble 4 ( skinner 1993 ) .    while a few b and a stars in young stellar groups have been identified as possible x - ray sources ( caillault & zoonematkermani 1989 , strom et al .",
    "1990 , pravdo & angelini 1993 ) , there is always the possibility that the x - ray emission is attributible to a low mass companion ( schmitt et al .",
    "1985 ) . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to attribute the x - ray luminosity of v892 tau to the low mass secondary of the system .",
    "the derived x - ray luminosity is consistent with the inferred luminosity of the secondary if we assume that the luminosity ratio of the two components of v892 tau is close to the ratio of their infrared luminosities , the star lies on the mean isochrone for this group , and we use the bolometric correction inferred from this placement .",
    "flux ratios are in general available at only one wavelength for these binaries , usually k ( 2.2@xmath94 m ) . for 5 of the 7 known binaries ,",
    "the flux ratios at k lie between 1.1 and 2.2 .",
    "the other 2 stars ( v892 tau and v410 tau ) have relatively much fainter companions .",
    "if we assume that this ratio represents the true luminosity ratio of the components , the extinction for both components is the same , and that they lie on the @xmath95 yr isochrone , we can estimate the masses of these stars .",
    "therefore these 7 companions can also be added to the low mass ( @xmath96 ) population of the cloud .      among the basic problems to be addressed by studies of star formation",
    "are ( 1 ) to derive the initial mass function ( imf ) for isolated star formation regions and compare with that derived from study of stars in the solar neighborhood ; and ( 2 ) the local efficiency of star formation in the star forming cores .",
    "implicit in the determination of the imf is the question of whether stars of mass lower than that in which hydrogen burning can be sustained ( brown dwarfs ) are plentiful and may therefore contribute to solving the `` missing mass '' problem .",
    "it is now possible to estimate the star formation efficiency of the l1495e cloud .",
    "the mass of the cloud has been estimated at between 180 and 230 @xmath13 ( ohnishi & mizuno 1993 ) .",
    "the total stellar mass in the central region of the cloud depends slightly on the set of tracks used to make the mass estimate .",
    "if the swenson et al.(1993 ) tracks are used , the total stellar mass is estimated at @xmath97 ; if the dantona & mazzitelli ( 1993 ) tracks are used , the total stellar mass is estimated at @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to star formation efficiencies between 5% and 7% .",
    "if the stars in the outer region of the cloud are included , the star formation efficiencies increase to between 8% and 9.3% .",
    "current constraints on the formation of bound clusters ( lada , margulis & dearborn 1984 ) require that at least 30% of the cloud mass must be converted to stars . unless a large number of low mass members of this group remain hidden within the cloud , at luminosities below the limit reached by this rosat exposure , it is unlikely that this group will remain bound .",
    "one of the first studies to examine the distribution of spectral types in nearby star forming regions was carried out by cohen & kuhi ( 1979 ) .",
    "while a small number of stars later than spectral type m0 were found in taurus , those authors assumed that the flattening of the mass spectrum at low masses apparent in their data , was a selection effect due to a magnitude cutoff .",
    "since that work , there have been several surveys aimed at increasing the known pms population of the taurus clouds : the proper motion surveys of jones & herbig ( 1979 ) , hartmann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and gomez et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; the h , k emission survey of herbig et al .",
    "( 1986 ) ; the x - ray sources from _",
    "einstein _ pointed observations ( walter et al .",
    "1988 ) ; and the deep h@xmath2 emission survey of briceo et al .",
    "the recent proper motion surveys , ( hartmann et al .  1991 , gomez et al.1992 ) have found a small number ( 7 ) of additional members of the taurus pms population , usually late type stars ( spt later than m3 ) with relatively weak h@xmath2 emission .",
    "most recently , briceo et al .  ( 1993 ) have used very deep ( v @xmath99 ) objective prism h@xmath2 emission surveys to search for as yet undetected pre - main sequence stars in the taurus clouds .",
    "they identified 12 new t tauri stars , 5 of which were found in l1544 , a region previously unsurveyed in h@xmath2 and containing only one identified pms star .",
    "most of the newly discovered pms stars are classical or strong emission t  tauri stars ( ctts ) .",
    "the pms evolutionary tracks used until this point ( cohen & kuhi 1979 , strom et al .",
    "1989b ) have identified the peak of the n(spt ) distribution in the taurus clouds ( at k7-m0 ) with stars of @xmath100 with the number of stars decreasing with mass until few stars are found below 0.4 @xmath13 .",
    "this result is in marked disagreement with the imf derived for the solar neighborhood .",
    "the imf found for the local solar neighborhood ( scalo 1986 , kroupa , tout & gilmore 1990 , tinney , mould & reid 1992 ) can be well fit by a log normal function peaking at @xmath101 and then either decreasing as the mass decreases or possibly staying constant for all lower masses .",
    "the pms stars identified in the above surveys have spectral types with either m or continuum + emission characteristics .",
    "their r magnitudes range from 14.2 to 18.5 . even though most of these newly discovered stars are m stars , the apparent deficiency of low mass stars remained .",
    "one possibility for hiding additional low mass stars is as secondaries in binary and multiple systems .",
    "recent studies ( ghez 1993 , simon et al .",
    "1992 , leinert et al .",
    "1992 ) have suggested that most stars form in multiple systems .",
    "this possibility must also be evaluated in order to fully account for the imf in star forming regions .",
    "it is also important to note that the masses for these stars obtained from the `` modern '' tracks are quite different from those obtained in the past . here",
    "stars that were recently considered as typical 1 @xmath102 pms stars are now found to be 0.3 - 0.5@xmath102 stars .",
    "while this may seem a small change , these typical tts will not be g stars when they arrive on the main sequence but early m stars .",
    "this change may have a significant effect on the analyses of disk stability and binary period distributions ( ghez 1993 , leinert et al .",
    "1992 ) since derived ratios of disk mass to stellar mass will increase and the total system masses for binaries will decrease .    as a consequence of ( 1 ) the newly discovered low mass members of the l1495e cloud population ( x - ray detections , 8 stars ; anonymous stars , 1 star ; low mass companions , 7",
    "known ) , and ( 2 ) masses derived from new tracks , the apparent deficit in the population of the low mass end of the imf in this part of the taurus clouds will be decreased considerably ( see below ) .    the combination of newly observed and already known pms stars in l1495e enables a modern discussion of the imf .",
    "since we have a deep survey only in the central region of the rosat field , we will use only the objects ( known and newly discovered ) that fall within that area .",
    "we begin with the 12 previously known members of the cloud population . to this",
    "we add 8 x - ray discovered pms stars , 1 certain pms star from the group of anonymous optically visible stars projected upon the cloud , 1 possible addition to the intermediate mass star population associated with the cloud , and , finally , the 5 known secondary stars to the cloud members within the central region that have been observed at high spatial resolution .",
    "this gives a total of 27 probable cloud members within a circle of radius 25@xmath103 centered on v410 tau .    in order to construct an imf for the pms population of this cloud",
    ", we must infer a mass for each star from its position in the hr diagram relative to the calculated evolution tracks . here",
    "we must deal with the problem that the mass deduced for each star differs depending on the tracks we choose to use .",
    "this is particularly true at the very low mass end of the range in which we are interested , where the two sets of tracks are most divergent .",
    "we construct an imf for each set of tracks in order to better compare the derived shape of the cloud imf .",
    "the results are presented in figure 11 .",
    "the results from both sets of tracks yield imfs that peak at @xmath1040.5 , identical to the result found by scalo(1986 ) from solar neighborhood stars .",
    "there are too few stars of masses greater than @xmath105 to allow us to draw any conclusions about the higher mass end of the imf in l1495e , and the behavior of the derived imf for masses below the peak is dependent upon the tracks chosen .",
    "while the imf drops toward lower masses , the drop is much more severe for the dantona & mazzitelli tracks .",
    "if the swenson et al.tracks are used , 10 stars are found in the 2 bins of lowest mass ( @xmath106 -0.8 ) , while if the dantona & mazzitelli tracks are chosen , only 2 stars are found in these bins .",
    "for this reason , and because ( 1 ) less than half of the cloud members have been searched for companions of subarcsecond separation ; and ( 2 ) there is no knowledge of binary systems with separation below the sensitivity of current instrumentation , we are unable to make a definitive statement about the shape of the cloud imf at these low masses",
    ". however , there is _ no evidence for a rise toward lower masses _ if the pms population we have identified is either complete or representative .",
    "we have attempted to estimate the number of possible additional members of the cloud population from our near infrared images .",
    "in addition to deriving the jhk magnitudes for the candidate x - ray sources , we also obtained near infrared magnitudes for all other objects appearing within these frames .",
    "most of these objects , in the frames away from the cloud edge , are quite faint .",
    "consequently , the photometric errors are larger and their colors are less definitive than we would like for the purpose of identifying possible cloud members . however , there are clearly some stars ( 8) whose presence in the central area of the cloud and whose colors ( indicating the presence of disk emission ) suggest that they are members of the cloud population",
    ". one of these stars , not visible on our long i image , just 40@xmath107 south - southeast of v410 tau , is brighter than @xmath108 and extremely red .",
    "some of the stars in the region near v892 tau are so red that no j magnitudes can be obtained , however they cluster about the tight group of stars found in this region , suggesting membership . a table giving the approximate coordinates of these stars and their photometry can be found in the appendix .",
    "we must emphasize again the need for very deep x - ray searches of star formation regions in order to locate the low mass members of the pms population .",
    "the lack of other comparably deep observations of star forming regions with rosat while the pspc was operative is extremely unfortunate .",
    "other nearby star formation regions have not shown a deficiency of m stars comparable to that seen in taurus - auriga .",
    "hughes and hartigan ( 1992 ) compare the spectral type distribution in the chamaeleon ii cloud with that seen in taurus .",
    "they find a higher fraction of stars with late spectral types in cha ii than are seen in taurus .",
    "krautter & kelemen ( 1987 ) show the distribution of spectral types for the lupus star formation region , at a comparable distance , which has only 2 stars earlier than k5 while 47 stars later than m0 are found .",
    "the new pms evolution tracks can explain the difference in the spectral type distribution between the taurus and the lupus clouds .",
    "the mean age of the stars in the lupus clouds is considerably older than that of the stars in the taurus clouds ( hughes & hartigan , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , using the `` modern '' tracks , as shown in figure 9 , the mean spectral type of the population will be considerably later in lupus than in taurus for the same distribution of stellar masses since these tracks take a considerable turn to lower effective temperature after @xmath109 yrs .",
    "because the x - ray emission from pms stars appears to be consistent with coronal emission models , the strength of the x - ray emission should be correlated with the strength of the dynamo generating the stellar magnetic field . in turn",
    ", we expect that a measure of the rotation of the star will be the proper surrogate for the dynamo strength ; and therefore that stellar rotation should correlate with the x - ray emission .",
    "however , one complication in this chain of logic is the fact that these very young stars are completely convective , and the currently favored dynamo models operate at the interface between the convective and the radiative zone , driven by differential rotation .",
    "however there is a distributed dynamo model ( rosner 1980 ) that works throughout the convection zone .    in this section",
    "we will evaluate the simplest correlations that we can make , the correlation of the x - ray luminosity with the stellar luminosity and with the rotational velocity . in these correlations",
    ", we will omit the data for v892 tau since it is likely that the x - ray emission is due to the fainter component of the system for which we are unable to establish a reliable luminosity estimate since we have no spectral type .",
    "our x - ray data consist solely of measured values with no upper limits , therefore we have no need to use survival statistics methods in our analysis",
    ". the x - ray luminosity and the stellar luminosity are very strongly correlated , with a formal probability of @xmath170.001 that they are uncorrelated .",
    "the slope of the relationship between @xmath110 and @xmath111 found from a least squares solution is @xmath112 .",
    "however , since the values of @xmath110 are instantaneous snapshots of highly variable sources , the accuracy of the slope determination is no doubt worse than that quoted .",
    "this relationship is shown in figure 12 .",
    "the wtts , ctts and stars that are no longer fully convective are indicated . while there is considerable overlap between the ctts and wtts , the wtts are clearly systematically more luminous than the ctts .",
    "while it is true that some of the wtts are found at earlier spectral types than are the ctts and therefore at higher stellar luminosities , it also appears to be true that the wtts are more luminous at x - ray wavelengths than the ctts when compared at constant stellar luminosity .",
    "dd tau is plotted twice in this figure , at its pre - flare and flare locations .",
    "the pre - flare location falls just below the center of the band , in the midst of a group of other points , while the flare point lies well above the majority of the points .",
    "it is possible that the other points lying well above the major part of the distribution represent stars that were not in their quiescent state at the time of the observation .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the x - ray luminosities of the least luminous of these pms stars have x - ray luminosities comparable to those of the young near main sequence k and m stars of the pleiades ( stauffer et al .",
    "in fact , because our detection limit is lower than that of the pleiades observations , some are even less luminous than the upper limits found for the undetected pleiades members .",
    "this must be taken into consideration when testing dynamo models and angular momentum evolution scenarios .",
    "we can compare this distribution with that found for the pms members of the cha i cloud ( feigelson et al .",
    "these authors find a correlation with a slope of @xmath113 for the relationship between the stellar luminosity and the x - ray luminosity for the cha i stars .",
    "for the stellar luminosities they used the values found by gauvin & strom ( 1992 ) adjusted for the closer distance that they chose to use . since in this relationship the distance enters in the same manner on both axes , it does not matter which distance is chosen .",
    "however , the method by which the stellar luminosity is calculated has now been improved . in order to remove any systematic effects introduced in this way",
    ", we have recalculated the stellar luminosities for the cha i stars using the j magnitude as our measure of the stellar photosphere as discussed in section 6.2 and using the same data compiled in gauvin and strom ( 1992 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are taken from feigelson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . in figure 13",
    "we have plotted the data for cha i with the relationship derived for the stars in l1495e and shown in figure 12 .",
    "we can clearly see that the cha i ctts , fainter wtts and radiative track stars exhibit the same slope to this relationship as found for the stars in l1495e , however they have systematically lower x - ray luminosities at constant stellar luminosity .",
    "the stars deviating from this relationship are the most luminous stars in the cloud ( excluding the 2 a stars not considered here ) .",
    "most of these stars are no longer fully convective ; the most luminous wtts lies on the boundary of the fully convective region .",
    "the only real anomalies are the 2 ctts ( vw cha and ww cha ) .",
    "one of these , vw cha , is a binary with a separation of 17@xmath107(reipurth and zinnecker 1993 , schwartz 1977 ) , both components of which must lie within the x - ray beam .",
    "reexamination of the spectra of these stars ( appenzeller , jankovics & krautter 1983 ) shows that these stars would better be classified as continuum + emission stars leading us to overestimate the stellar luminosity for 2 reasons , 1 ) the flux at j is contaminated by disk emission , and 2 ) the assigned early k spectral types are most likely too early leading us to use a bolometric correction too small .",
    "there is no simple way to make a correction to the luminosities assigned to these stars , short of obtaining high resolution spectra .",
    "therefore we merely indicate that the stellar luminosities for these stars are upper limits",
    ". the relative absence of wtts in this region is no doubt due to the fact that the stars with adequate photometric and spectroscopic data are those which were discovered by h@xmath2 emission surveys .",
    "many more cloud members have been discovered in the x - ray emission surveys and in more sensitive h@xmath2 emission surveys ( hartigan 1993 ) , but as yet lack the information necessary to place them in the hr diagram .",
    "an interesting aspect of this diagram is that the x - ray luminosity of stars which are now on their radiative tracks appears to be decreasing faster with the age of the star than do the x - ray luminosities of stars still fully convective .",
    "this could reflect the fact that the surface magnetic field strength is relatively weaker for these stars and therefore that the dynamo generation mechanism is not as efficient as that in the fully convective stars .",
    "a possible correlated effect has been seen by edwards et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in the angular momentum statistics of these stars .",
    "while the circumstellar disk appears able to regulate the rotation period of the fully convective stars quite efficiently through the linking of the stellar magnetic field with the disk , this process appears to be less efficient in stars that have radiative cores .    another way to look at the correlation of rotation with coronal",
    "heating is to use the relationship first proposed by bouvier ( 1990 ) between x - ray surface flux and rotational period of the star .",
    "we are fortunate to have 6 rotational periods determined for the stars in l1495e ( rydgren et al .",
    "1984 , bouvier et al .",
    "1986 , vrba et al .",
    "1986 , walter et al .",
    "1987 , vrba et al .  1988 , bouvier et al .  1993 ) , and also v@xmath114 data ( hartmann et al",
    ".  1986 , hartmann & stauffer 1989 ) for this group .",
    "there are many fewer rotational periods determined in cha  i ( bouvier & bertout 1988 ) . in order to make use of a larger database",
    ", we will translate the rotation periods into projected equatorial velocities through knowledge of the stellar radius . in figure 14a",
    "we show the relationship between @xmath115 and rotational velocity .",
    "those velocities that are derived from rotation periods are shown by filled circles while those known only from measurement of stellar line widths are marked with open circles . in figure 14b",
    "the same relationship is shown for the cha i cloud stars ; the v@xmath114 values are taken from franchini et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and walter ( 1992 ) .",
    "the two stars marked with limiting values in both rotational velocity and surface flux are vs cha and ww cha , mentioned earlier .",
    "these stars are very heavily veiled and therefore the luminosity and thus the radii are probably over estimated , leading to an underestimate in x - ray surface flux . franchini et al .",
    "( 1988 ) note that the rotational velocities that they have determined would be over estimated if a substantial veiling flux is present . in figure",
    "14a the data for the pleiades stars is shown ( stauffer et al .",
    "the pleiades data can be described as filling a wide band in log @xmath116 at rotational velocities @xmath117 km / s . below that velocity",
    "much lower values of log  @xmath116 can be found .",
    "it is difficult to look for a functional relationship in this data since values of v@xmath114 give only lower limits to @xmath118 .",
    "however , it is clear that the slowly rotating pleiades stars exhibit much lower x - ray surface fluxes ( stauffer et al .",
    "the l1495e x - ray data is consistent with the pleiades data .",
    "however , because of the small number of stars in this group having measured v@xmath114 s , only 1 slow rotator , no independent assessment of this behavior can be made for pms stars from this data . therefore we can not separate age and rotation effects .    because the derivation of other stellar parameters , in particular the stellar mass , are dependent upon the set of stellar evolutionary tracks used , we prefer to wait until the new tracks have been further evaluated until attempting further correlations with derived stellar parameters",
    ". it will also be useful to have a larger body of x - ray data derived from the rosat pointed observations for stellar populations of a range of ages .",
    "we will then be able to separate the effects of age and rotation for stars in a small mass range from first appearance to the main sequence .",
    "the l1495e cloud is a region of very active star formation .",
    "our multiwavelength deep survey of this region has considerably increased our knowledge of the pms population within the cloud .",
    "the rosat pspc observation allowed us to identify 8 new low mass ( @xmath119 ) members of the cloud population .",
    "serendipitous observations of otherwise undistinguished stars has added 1 ( or possibly 2 ) more members .",
    "nearly all of the new members of the cloud population are of spectral type m3 and later and thus represent a heretofore unrepresented fraction of the cloud population .",
    "this population appears to be nearly coeval ; that is the spread in the hr diagram is small at any given mass .",
    "the mean age lies between @xmath120 and @xmath121 yr depending upon the adopted tracks .",
    "these observations combined with the use of `` modern '' evolutionary tracks allow us to address an outstanding problem concerning the pms population in the taurus molecular clouds , the apparent deficiency of stars with masses below @xmath122 .",
    "while the addition of the newly discovered cloud members and the identification of the low mass companions of other cloud members helps us to alleviate this deficiency , the use of the new evolutionary tracks is the key factor in understanding the mass distribution in the l1495e population .",
    "the masses deduced for stars of @xmath121 yrs and younger are considerably lower than those previously derived ( strom et al .",
    "this allows us to understand the large difference in the effective temperature distribution , as reflected in spectral types , between the pms population in lupus and that in taurus as merely a reflection of different ages of the two groups .",
    "the near infrared observations of the newly recognized cloud members show that 6 of 8 exhibit colors characteristic of disk emission . with the spectra obtained with hydra , we find that , with the possible exception of the serendipitously observed a2 star , the new cloud members are low mass stars ( @xmath123 ) and are typically deeply embedded in the cloud",
    ". the images of 2 of the low luminosity iras sources are extended .",
    "these images , in combination with their spectral energy distributions , and the models of kenyon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , demonstrate that these objects are still surrounded by dense core material , even though one of the objects is actually found at the edge of the main cloud .",
    "although there are only 35 known members of this stellar aggregate , 27 of which lie within the completely sampled region , we show that the observed imf for this group is consistent with the imf found by scalo ( 1986 ) for the field population , with a peak near @xmath1240.5 and a falloff toward lower masses .",
    "there is no evidence for a rise as mass decreases .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the l1495e stars is highly correlated with the stellar luminosity with a slope to the relationship of 1.80 @xmath125 0.01 .",
    "this can be seen in the observations of the cha i stars as well , although the higher mass stars in this group have much lower x - ray luminosities than their counterparts in l1495e , perhaps due to the greater age of the cha i association ( @xmath126 yr on the alexander tracks ) .",
    "when the x - ray surface flux of the pleiades sample is examined as a function of the rotational velocity of the stars , it is seen that no systematic variation is found for velocities greater than 20 km / s .",
    "however , below that velocity the range of observed x - ray surface flux increases dramatically with stars of low projected rotational velocities showing the lowest surface fluxes . when the rotational velocity drops below 20 km / s , the energy source powering the x - ray emission in these stars is substantially diminished .",
    "the x - ray data for the l1495e stars is consistent with the pleiades data .",
    "however there are too few stars in the sample having measured rotational velocities to enable us to separate age and rotation effects .",
    "the authors would like to thank patrick hartigan for obtaining the r and i band ccd frames , and ronald probst , michael meyer , patricia knezak and lynne hillenbrand for each obtaining part of the near infrared frames . without their help this paper would have greatly suffered .",
    "the authors would also like to acknowledge support from the national science foundation ( ses ) , the nasa planetary science and origins of solar systems programs , the nasa adp program and , of course , the rosat observations support ( kms ) .",
    "in this section we give the data on the anonymous stars that were serendipitously observed with hydra and with sqiid . in table 5",
