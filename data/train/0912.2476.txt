    "the structural and kinematical properties of gcss are considered to provide valuable information on the formation and evolution of their host galaxies ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; romanowsky et al .",
    "recent observational studies on kinematical properties of gcss in galaxies and their comparison with theoretical and numerical works have advanced our understanding on mass distributions of galaxies ( e.g. , pierce et al .",
    "2006 ; romanowsky et al .",
    "2009 ) , formation of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , bekki et al . 2005 ) , and formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , beasley et al .",
    "a growing number of observational data sets on kinematical properties of gcss have been now accumulated not only for galaxies in the local group but also for nearby galaxies ( brodie & strader 2006 for a recent review ) so that we can discuss formation processes of their host galaxies and their dependences on galactic global properties ( e.g. , hubble types ) in more detail based on the observations .",
    "one of the intriguing properties of gcss in galaxies is the observed rotational kinematics of the gcs in m31 ( e.g. , huchra et al .",
    "1982 ; perrett et al .",
    "recent wide - field surveys of the gcs in m31 ( lee et al .",
    "2008 ) have confirmed that the gcs composed both of metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 in their criterion ) and metal - rich ( fe / h ] @xmath3 ) objects has a rotational amplitude of @xmath4 km s@xmath1 .",
    "such kinematics are in a striking contrast with the low rotation of the galaxy s gcs ( e.g. , armandroff 1989 ) with an origin that remains unclear .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to discuss ( i ) why the gcs of m31 shows such a large amount of rotation and ( ii ) what implications it has for the formation and evolution of m31 .",
    "previous numerical works showed that rotational kinematics of gcss in elliptical galaxies can be due to past major merger events that formed the galaxies ( e.g. , hernquist & bolte 1993 ; bekki et al .",
    "we thus consider that the rotational kinematics of the gcs is closely associated with a major merger event in m31 long ago and thereby investigate whether galaxy merging can reproduce well the observed kinematics of the gcs .",
    "we also discuss whether the observed rotating bulge / bar in the m31 ( e.g. , beaton et al .",
    "2007 ) can be due to the major merger event responsible for the formation of the gcs with rotational kinematics .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "since the numerical methods and techniques we employ for modeling dynamical evolution of mergers between two disks with gcs have already been detailed elsewhere ( bekki et al . 2005 ; bekki & forbes 2006 ) , we give only a brief review here .",
    "the progenitor disk galaxies that take part in a merger are given a dark halo , a thin exponential disk , and gcs initially in disks ( referred to as `` dgcs '' from now on ) and in halos ( `` hgcs '' ) .",
    "the total mass and size of an exponential disk with no bulge are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we consider that the total stellar mass of a merger remnant should be similar to the total mass ( @xmath7 ) of the present bulge of m31 ( @xmath8 ; e.g. , seigar et al .",
    "2008 ; geehan et al .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath9 as a reasonable value in the present study .",
    "we adopt the density distribution of the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) with the mass of @xmath10 and a concentration parameter determined by @xmath10 according to the formula derived by recent cdm simulations ( e.g. , neto et al 2007 ) .",
    "the stellar disk has the scale length ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath12",
    ".    the present bulge - less disk model would be reasonable for less massive disk galaxies with no / little bulges like the large magellanic cloud and magellanic - type galaxies with total masses of @xmath13 , but it would not be so realistic for luminous disk galaxies like the merger progenitor disks of m31 .",
    "we however conjecture since the bulge masses are quite small in comparison with total masses of galaxies ( inclusive of dark matter halos ) , final kinematics of gcss in merger remnants would not depend strongly on whether or not we include bulges in initial disks .",
    "thus , as long as we mainly discuss global kinematical properties of gcss in merger remnants , the present model can be regarded as an appropriate one .",
    "previous observations revealed that less luminous disk galaxies , which are considered to form the bulge component of m31 with rotational kinematics of the gcs in the present study , have disky distributions with rotational kinematics in their gcs ( e.g. , freeman et al .",
    "1983 ; olsen et al .",
    "we thus consider the presence of dgcs in merger progenitor disks in the present study : dgcs were not considered in our previous works ( e.g. , bekki et al . 2003a ; 2005 ) and such dgcs with strongly rotational kinematics are not observed in the metal - rich gcs of the galaxy .",
    "the dgcs have the same exponential distribution and rotational kinematics as field stars in the stellar disk of their host galaxy .",
    "the initial rotational amplitude of dgcs is @xmath14 km s@xmath1 for @xmath9 and @xmath15 .",
    "the galactic hgcs and the stellar halo have similar radial density profiles of @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "we therefore assume that the hgcs in our galaxies have a power - law profile with an exponent of @xmath19 and a half - number radius of @xmath20 ( which is @xmath21 kpc for the galaxy and thus consistent with observations ) .",
    "the hgcs are assumed to have isotropic velocity dispersions determined by the mass distribution of the galaxy .",
    "total numbers of dgcs and hgcs in a galaxy are set to be 100 and 100 , respectively .",
    "the mass ratio of the two disks ( @xmath22 ) in a merger is assumed to be a free parameter . in all of the simulations of pair mergers , the orbit of the two disks",
    "is set to be initially in the @xmath23 plane and the distance between the center of mass of the two disks is assumed to be @xmath24 . the pericenter distance ( @xmath25 ) and the eccentricity ( @xmath26 ) in a pair merger are assumed to be free parameters that control orbital energy and angular momentum of the merger .",
    "the spin of each galaxy in a merger is specified by two angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where suffix @xmath29 is used to identify each galaxy .",
    "@xmath27 is the angle between the @xmath30 axis and the vector of the angular momentum of a disk .",
    "@xmath28 is the azimuthal angle measured from the @xmath31 axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of a disk onto the @xmath23 plane .",
    "we mainly show the results of `` the standard model '' with @xmath9 , @xmath15 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "we describe the results of this standard model with an orbital configuration similar to `` prograde - prograde '' merging ( in which the orbital spin axis of the merger is parallel to intrinsic spin axes of the two disks ) , mainly because the final gcs can clearly show strongly rotational kinematics as observed in m31 .",
    "we also show the results of the model with a `` prograde - retrograde '' orbital configuration in which @xmath39 and other parameters are exactly the same as those in the standard model .    in order to discuss the origin of the central bar / bulge of m31",
    ", we investigate in which models the merger remnants show rotating stellar bars .",
    "although we investigate 34 models , we show the results of five representative models which either show clearly rotating bars or have no such rotating components in merger remnants : comparison between these models enables us to understand better the role of an ancient merger event in the formation of the bulge component in m31 .    the model parameters and some brief results are given in the table 1 .",
    "the total particle number for a major merger in a simulation is @xmath40 and the simulation is carried out on the latest version of grape ( gravity pipe , grape-7 ) which is the special - purpose computer for gravitational dynamics ( sugimoto et al .",
    "1990 ) . in estimating the gcs kinematics , the merger remnant is viewed near to edge - on , and binned",
    "major - axis profiles are constructed . in order to have enough objects in each bin , gcs at all minor axis distances",
    "are included , which also approximately replicates the comparison observations .",
    "formation of metal - rich gcs through dissipative gas dynamics of galaxy merging ( e.g. , bekki et al . 2002 ) and adiabatic contraction of the gcs in m31 due to later massive growth of the disk component could increase appreciably the rotational amplitude @xmath41 of the gcs .",
    "the quantitative estimation of this effect is not done here and will be done in our future studies .",
    "it should be stressed that this paper is meant to be schematic rather than reproducing the observed galaxy in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "fig . 1 shows that both dgcs and hgcs can be spatially mixed to form a new gcs during violent dynamical relation that results in transformation from two disks into one spheroidal galaxy . owing to angular momentum redistribution during major merging , not only hgcs but also dgcs",
    "can be transferred to the outer halo region and thus seen there in the merger remnant .",
    "the half - number radii for the dgcs and the hgcs are both @xmath42 kpc in the merger remnant , which is consistent with the observations by battistini et al .",
    "as the stellar remnant shows a rotating bar ( discussed later in  4 ) , dgcs and hgcs also show barred structures , appreciably flattened shapes ( qualitatively consistent with observations ) , and figure rotation .",
    "2 clearly shows global rotation both in dgcs and hgcs , though the radial profiles of @xmath41 and @xmath43 do not smoothly change owing to the small numbers of gcs at each bin .",
    "the maximum @xmath41 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath45 ) for dgcs ( hgcs ) within the central 16 kpc are 136 km s@xmath1 ( 123 km s@xmath1 ) and 102 km s@xmath1 ( 106 km s@xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore @xmath46 for dgcs and hgcs are 1.3 and 1.2 , respectively , which means that the final gcs has strongly rotational kinematics .",
    "the velocity profile becomes flat ( @xmath47 km s@xmath1 ) at @xmath48 kpc .",
    "the simulated two - dimensional line - of - sight velocity map of the gcs shows clearly global rotation .",
    "we here compare the simulated rotational kinematics with the observed one in m31 ( e.g. , @xmath49 km s@xmath1 in perrett et al .",
    "observational error bars in @xmath41 are not so small and @xmath41 ranges from 98 km s@xmath1 to 188 km s@xmath1 for @xmath50kpc @xmath51 5kpc ( lee et al .",
    "2008 ) , where @xmath52 is the projected vertical distance from the m31 disk plane .",
    "the simulated rational amplitude of the gcs is slightly smaller than the observed one by perrett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : it should be noted that the observational results depend on the details of how the data are binned and fitted .",
    "we consider that the best model needs to reproduce the above @xmath41 of @xmath53 km s@xmath1 fig .",
    "3 shows that even the dark matter halo of the merger remnant can have a small amount of rotation ( @xmath54 km s@xmath1 ) owing to the redistribution of angular momentum ( i.e. , conversion of orbital angular momentum of merging two galaxies into internal one of the merger remnant ) .",
    "this result suggests that if the two galaxies have hot gaseous halos , then the remnant is highly likely to have a slowly rotating gaseous halo .",
    "3 also shows that the stellar component of the merger remnant has a significant amount of rotation ( @xmath55 km s@xmath1 ) , which means that the spheroid is rapidly rotating ( i.e. , rotating bulge is formed from major merging ) .",
    "the reason for the smaller @xmath41 of the dark matter halo in comparison with the gcs is due largely to the difference in the initial spatial distribution between the halo and the gcs , demonstrating that gc rotation would not be used to infer dark matter halo rotation .",
    "the inner part of the merger can more strongly spin - up during and after major merging owing to ( i ) the prograde - prograde orbital configuration of the merging and ( ii ) the development of the rotating bar .",
    "the distribution of the gcs in the merger progenitor disk is by a factor of 4 more compact that that of the halo so that the gcs can more strongly spin - up : most of the individual gcs can obtain a larger amount of intrinsic spin angular momentum with respect to the center of the merger remnant .",
    "4 shows that strongly rotational kinematics of gcs can be seen only in dgcs in the model with @xmath56 ( model 4 ) : @xmath44 is 107 km s@xmath1 for dgcs and 38 km s@xmath1 for hgcs .",
    "the higher and lower @xmath44 in dgcs and hgcs , respectively , are confirmed in other unequal - mass merger models ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) .",
    "it should be noted here that the model 1 shows only slightly higher @xmath44 in dgcs , which is due to different kinematics between dgcs and hgcs ( i.e. , _ initial _ global rotation only in dgcs ) .",
    "these results therefore mean that if metal - poor and metal - rich gcs originate from hgcs and dgcs , respectively , then kinematical properties of gcs in the remnants of galaxy merging with smaller @xmath58 ( or unequal - mass merging ) can be significantly different between metal - poor and metal - rich ones .",
    "these results furthermore imply that the observed rotational kinematics both for metal - poor and metal - rich gcs in m31 can give some constraints on the mass - ratio ( @xmath22 ) of two disks in galaxy merging that could have occurred in m31 .",
    "the model 1 does not explain well the observed total halo mass : later numerous accretion events of dwarfs with few gcs and stars are required to increase significantly the total mass after the merging .",
    "the models with larger @xmath59 can show higher @xmath44 in dgcs owing to the initially higher circular velocities of the stellar disks .",
    "for example , the model with @xmath60 ( model 5 ) shows @xmath61 km s@xmath1 and @xmath62 km s@xmath1 : it should be stressed here that the total mass of the remnant is @xmath63 thus can be more consistent with observations than model 1 in terms of the total mass of m31 .",
    "a possible reason for the lower @xmath44 ( 91 km s@xmath1 ) for hgcs in the model 5 is that more strongly self - gravitating stellar disks can also play a role in increasing global rotation of hgcs : such a role is weaker in the model 5 in which the disk is much more weakly self - gravitating .    models with different orbital configurations can show stronger rotational kinematics in dgcs and hgcs , if larger @xmath25 are adopted .",
    "for example , the model with a prograde - retrograde orbital configuration ( model 2 ) shows @xmath64 km s@xmath1 and @xmath65 km s@xmath1 but does not show a bar .",
    "the models with smaller @xmath25 ( e.g. , model 3 ) show smaller @xmath44 in dgcs , which implies that the observed @xmath44 can give some constraints on the orbital parameters for galaxy merging that occurred in m31 .",
    "thus only the models with larger @xmath25 can better reproduce the observed kinematical properties of the m31 gcs .",
    "5 shows that the stellar remnant looks like a bar if it is viewed from face - on in the standard model of the present study : the bar is confirmed to have figure rotation . the stellar distribution viewed from edge - on appears to have a flattened spherical body , which can be identified as a bulge .",
    "the present study thus implies that m31 s observed bulge / bar ( e.g. , beaton et al .",
    "2007 ) can be formed from an ancient major merger event .",
    "it should be noted here that dissipative gas dynamics which can determine the final morphological properties of merger remnants ( e.g. , boxy or disky shapes ) is not included in the present study .",
    "if the inner bar / bulge of m31 was really formed from ancient major merging before its disk formation , then the later development of the stellar and gaseous disk may well be significantly influenced by dynamical action of the already formed bar .",
    "also , later slow gas accretion and the resultant disk formation in m31 could change structural and kinematics properties of the already developed gcs to some extent : it would be possible that adiabatic compression of the gcs by later gradual development of the disk can enhance the rotational amplitude of the gcs .",
    "it is our future study to numerically investigate disk formation and evolution of m31 under the presence of the already formed bar .",
    "the present work suggests that the hot diffuse halo gas recently detected by _",
    "chandra _ ( li & wang 2007 ) can have a significant amount of rotation resulting from angular momentum redistribution of the possible major merger .",
    "furthermore , the observed extensive hi cloud population of m31 ( e.g. , thilker et al .",
    "2004 ; westmeier et al .",
    "2007 ) can also have rotational kinematics if they originate from stripped hi gas from the merger progenitor disks .",
    "given that major merging can form very extended stellar halos ( bekki et al .",
    "2003b ; bekki & peng 2006 ) , the observed extended stellar halo in m31 ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2007 ) would have fossil information in the possible ancient major merger event .",
    "if m31 was formed from multiple and sequential merging of dwarf satellites from random directions , it seems to be highly unlikely that the final gcs has a large amount of global rotation .",
    "therefore , if the rotational kinematics of the gcs derived from previous observations is further confirmed by ongoing observational studies , it then suggests that a dramatic physical process is responsible for the observed _ globally organized motion _ of gcs .",
    "our simulations imply that an ancient major merger of two disks with gcs with different metallicities could be responsible for the enigmatic kinematics of the gcs in m31 , as well as the inner bar or bulge .",
    "i am grateful to the anonymous referee for valuable comments , which contribute to improve the present paper ."
