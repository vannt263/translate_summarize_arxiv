    "cosmological recombination is one of the key processes in the early universe .",
    "it determines the epoch of decoupling of radiation from matter and thereby determines the epochs at which baryonic matter can start to fall into gravitational potential wells created by clustering cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "afterwards these cdm+baryonic matter clouds develop into non - relativistic gravity bound systems like galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sizes of these proto - objects also depend on cosmological recombination via the kinetics of divergence of radiation and matter temperatures which determines the critical jeans length .",
    "cosmological recombination affects primordial chemistry ( @xcite ) and correspondingly rate of radiative cooling of collapsing clouds ( via emission in resonant lines of molecules which depends on the abundances of primordial molecules ) .    from observational point of view",
    "the cosmological recombination is also very important process because its kinetics determines the position of last scattering surface ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this in turn affects the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy which is one of the main sources of information about evolution of the early universe , its composition and other properties .",
    "a great number of experiments on cmbr anisotropy have been carried out in the last thirty years ( relikt-1 1983 , cobe 1989 , qmap - toco 1996 , boomerang 1997 - 2003 , maxima 1998 - 1999 , wmap 2001-present day , and many others ) .",
    "treatment of the results of these experiments demands clear understanding of cosmological recombination physics .",
    "that is why many efforts have been made for theoretical investigation of cosmological recombination and development of applied numerical codes for modelling of this process ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "increasing accuracy of experiments in the last decade leads to increase of efforts of theorists in the study of details of cosmological recombination ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and perfection of numerical codes . in the light of soon releases of experimental data from planck mission this task becomes more and more important and urgent ( for overview of efforts of investigators to find exact recombination scenario and to estimate remain uncertainties see e.g. @xcite ) . today for successful treatment of planck data the minimal required accuracy of numerical codes evaluating cosmological recombination",
    "is about 0.1% ( on free electron fraction ) for the epoch of hydrogen recombination and 1% for the epoch of helium recombination .",
    "desirable accuracy is about 0.01% and 0.1% correspondingly .",
    "the next possible step of the investigations of the early universe in the epochs @xmath0 is the experimental study of cmbr spectral distortions originated from cosmological recombination of hydrogen and helium .",
    "such experiments would be powerful sources of information about history of the universe in these epochs .",
    "thanks to the numerous theoretical works in this field ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) one can understand parameters of these spectral distortions clearly enough . of course the cosmological recombination is an integral part of modelling of these distortions .",
    "note that some simple methods for this problem ( @xcite ) demand the knowledge of derivatives of ionization fractions of hydrogen and helium , so calculated ionization fractions should be smooth as possible ( i.e. without sharp numerical features ) . in spite of the fact that detection of cmbr spectral distortions by cosmological recombination is impossible today",
    ", the rapid progress of measurement equipment for cmbr anisotropy allows us to hope that such experiments will be possible in the near future .",
    "thus the main aim of this work is to present numerical code covering investigations of cosmological recombination widely as possible within simple model which we used .",
    "our code called * atlant * ( * a*dvanced * t*hree * l*evel * a*pproximation for * n*umerical * t*reatment of cosmological recombination ) may be useful for regular calculations of free electron fraction for treatment of cmbr anisotropy data , further investigations of cosmological recombination , theoretical predictions of new observational cosmological effects ( e.g. @xcite ) , and comparison with other numerical codes ( e.g. * recfast * by @xcite and @xcite , * rico * by @xcite , * recsparse * by @xcite , * hyrec * by @xcite , * cosmorec * by @xcite ) .",

    "note that recombination and ionization coefficients included in the kinetic equation ( [ zeld_peebles_eq1 ] ) should be calculated at different temperatures ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "residual difference which does not exceed @xmath241 for the period @xmath242 can be explained by a little different values of physical constants and different integration methods which have been used in * atlant * and * recfast*.    in fig . [ fig3 ]",

    "parameters of the fudge function have been choosen as following : @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 .",

    "the breaks in the range @xmath247 and break at @xmath248 are the numerical features connected with switch in * recfast * code .",
    "the maximum of difference is about -0.23% at @xmath249 .",
    "the difference between results by * atlant * and * recfast * for the epoch of heii@xmath37hei recombination arises because different approximations for estimate of effective eacape probability are used : in * atlant * the approach based on analytical consideration of resonance radiation transfer in the presence of continuum absorption is used ( @xcite ) while * recfast * uses the simple approximation with an additional fudge factor @xmath250 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it leads to the numerical differences because used approximations are not identical .",
    "also there is physical reason for divergence of these approximations : @xcite have determined @xmath250 from the best agreement with result by @xcite who took into account not only hydrogen continuum opacity but also feedbacks for resonant transitions of hei and found this effect is about 0.46% at @xmath251 .",
    "later works ( e.g. @xcite ) show that this feedback effect is about 0.17% at @xmath248 , i.e. negligible for the most of modern problems connected with cosmological recombination ( e.g. cmbr anisotropy analysis ) .",
    "thus we do not take helium feedbacks into account in the present version of the code .",
    "one more important point of calculations of effective escape probability for hei is the estimate of number of neutral hydrogen at the high redshifts @xmath252 ( i.e. when hydrogen ionization fraction close to unity [ e.g. greater than 0.985 ] ) : * recfast * uses saha formula for this aim , while in * atlant * the kinetic equation is solved in the whole range of redshifts to determine the fractions of all considered plasma components .",
    "this explains the discrepancy between results of the present paper and @xcite where approximation by @xcite has also been investigated by using earlier version of our code ( i.e. wong - moss - scott approximation has been calculated , but number of neutral hydrogen has been calculated from kinetic equation ) .    in fig .",

    "the break at @xmath253 is the numerical feature connected with switches in * recfast * code again . in the range of redshifts",
    "@xmath254 the difference between the results by * atlant * and * recfast * arises because heiii@xmath37heii recombination is treated by * atlant * in non - equilibrium way while * recfast * treats this according to saha formula .",
    "the maximum of difference is about 0.225% at @xmath255 .",
    "such difference is too small to be a reason of any observational effects at the current level of experimental accuracy , but non - equilibrium treatment of heiii@xmath37heii allows us to avoid artificial numerical features ( that is important for the modelling of cmbr spectral distortion arising from heiii@xmath37heii recombination ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the deviation of the matter temperature from the radiation temperature is presented .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the correction @xmath210 , dashed - dotted curve corresponds to @xmath256 , and solid curve corresponds to @xmath257 .",
    "one can see that difference between the radiation and matter temperature is less than @xmath258 down to @xmath259 and less than @xmath260 down to @xmath261 . taking into account that @xmath42 is included in kinetic equation ( [ zeld_peebles_eq1 ] ) only via recombination coefficient @xmath262 one can expect the similar changes in hydrogen ionization fraction at transition from approximation @xmath263 to more exact estimate of @xmath42 . from accuracy point of view",
    "the correction @xmath211 becomes important beginning from @xmath264 where / when it achieves values about @xmath260 . at the low @xmath2 ( @xmath234 ) the correction @xmath211 is larger than 20% of @xmath210 and",
    "should be taken into account for correct determination of residual ionization fraction as possible . in fig .",
