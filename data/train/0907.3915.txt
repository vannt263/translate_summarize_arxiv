    "type ia supernovae ( henceforth snia ) play a key role in astrophysics as premier distance indicators for cosmology ( phillips 1993 ; riess 1998 ; perlmutter 1999 ) , as direct probes of low - mass star formation rates at cosmological distances ( scannapieco 2005 ; mannucci 2006 ; maoz 2008 ) and as significant contributors to iron - group elements in the cosmos ( wheeler 1989 ; timmes 1995 ; feltzing 2001 ; strigari 2006 ) .",
    "our current understanding is that there are two major progenitor systems for these events .",
    "the first possibility , the single - degenerate scenario , consists of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf in a binary system evolving to the stage of central ignition by mass overflow from a low - mass stellar companion ( whelan & iben 1973 ; nomoto 1982 ; hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) .",
    "the second possibility , the double - degenerate scenario , consists of the merger of two white dwarfs in a binary system ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ; yoon 2007 ) .",
    "it is unknown at what relative frequency both of these channels operate ( livio 2000 ; maoz 2008 ) .",
    "collisions between two white dwarfs , are likely to happen less frequently than binary mergers . however , as discussed in timmes ( 2009 ) and rosswog ( 2009 ) , they will occur in globular clusters where the stellar densities are extremely high . for a typical globular cluster velocity dispersion of @xmath2 5 - 10 km s@xmath5 , and a white dwarf escape velocity of @xmath2 4000 km s@xmath5 ,",
    "the physical cross - section of equal mass white dwarfs is enhanced by a factor of @xmath6 by gravitational focusing . for an average globular cluster mass of @xmath7(brodie & strader 2006 ) , a salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 ) , and a globular cluster core radius of 1.5 pc ( peterson & king 1975 ) , we conservatively estimate an average white dwarf number density in globulars to be @xmath8 pc@xmath9 , and estimating that about @xmath10 of the average @xmath11 @xmath12 per mpc@xmath9 stellar mass density in the universe is in globular clusters ( see pfahl 2009 and references therein ) the overall rate of such collisions is about @xmath13 per comoving mpc@xmath14 per year .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath0 , @xmath15 collisions per year .",
    "note that this calculation depends in detail on the minimum impact parameter that leads to explosive nuclear burning , as studied in detail below .",
    "our estimate is significantly lower than a recently submitted paper ( rosswog 2009 ) , primarily due to the assumed core radius of globulars clusters .    beyond @xmath2 50 mpc ,",
    "current surveys are not sufficiently accurate to distinguish between supernovae in globular clusters from those that arise from the galaxy field stars in front or behind globular clusters ( pfahl 2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , observations of globular clusters in the nearby s0 galaxy ngc 7457 have detected what is likely to be a remnant of a snia ( chomiuk 2008 ) .",
    "taken together , these estimates and observations suggest that white dwarf collisions are likely to appear in current and future snia samples . as double - degenerate supernovae from collisions may not fit the standard templates , sn surveys may have to consider possible contamination from double - degenerate collisions that masquerade as traditional snia .    in this paper",
    "we begin to examine collisions between two white dwarfs as a pathway for producing snia . in  [ sec : simulations ] we describe our simulations of the impact between two 0.6 m@xmath3 white dwarfs , and in  [ sec : results ] we discuss the resulting hydrodynamics , thermodynamics , and nucleosynthesis . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we speculate on other mass pairs and impact parameters , and discuss the implication of our results .",
    "all of our simulations are conducted with a 3d smooth particle hydrodynamics code , snsph ( fryer 2006 ) . in collision scenarios with a non - zero impact parameter , angular",
    "momentum plays a critical role in the final outcome , and lagrangian particle methods generally conserve angular momentum better than eulerian grid methods .",
    "we added a 13 isotope @xmath16-chain nuclear reaction network ( timmes 1999 ; timmes 2000 ; fryxell 2000 ) and a helmholtz free energy based stellar equation of state ( timmes & arnett 1999 ; timmes & swesty 2000 ) to snsph to construct the initial white dwarf models and run our collision models .",
    "our initial 0.6white dwarf is composed of equal parts @xmath17c and @xmath18o and is created using the weighted voronoi tessellations method ( diehl & statler 2006 ) , which arranges particles in the configuration corresponding to the lowest energy state that is consistent with a given equation of state .",
    "the resulting white dwarfs have only minor temperature variations around 1@xmath1910@xmath20 k. any evolution the white dwarfs experience before the collision , then , is due only to their mutual gravitational interaction .",
    "we use a simple 2-body solver to calculate the relative velocities of the two white dwarfs immediately before a collision for a given impact parameter and an initial relative velocity of 10 km s@xmath5 , which corresponds to the typical virial velocity of a globular cluster .",
    "the velocities calculated by our 2-body solver then serve as the initial conditions for our collision simulations .",
    "various angles of incidence for the collision were chosen . in table 1 ,",
    "the initial impact parameter , @xmath21 , is the vertical separation of the centers of the white dwarfs in terms of rat a horizontal separation of @xmath22 . due to gravitational focusing ,",
    "the final impact parameter , @xmath23 , the vertical separation at the moment of collision , is significantly smaller , and is given in table 1 in terms of the radius of a 0.6white dwarf , @xmath24r .",
    "the number of particles @xmath25 in each model is also given in table 1 , i.e. , there are @xmath26 particles per white dwarf .",

    "6 seconds.,width=264,height=396 ]    snapshots of planar slices from the head - on collision case are given in figure [ fig : headon ] .",
    "this extremely unlikely , but physically instructive scenario was presented in timmes ( 2009 ) and has also recently been explored in rosswog ( 2009 ) . as the white dwarfs approach each other , their velocities increase to the escape speed , @xmath24000 km s@xmath5 ( first panel ) .",
    "when the two white dwarfs first make contact ( second panel ) , shock waves develop that attempt to travel outward along the @xmath27-axis at roughly the sound speed , @xmath23000 km s@xmath5 ( also see figure [ fig : velocities ] ) . the near equality of these two characteristic speeds means the shock waves stall as material falls through them ( fig .  [ fig : headon ] third panel ) .",
    "the region between the two fronts achieves a nearly constant temperature ( @xmath28 k ) and density ( @xmath29 g cm@xmath9 ) with a non - explosive , mild rate of nuclear burning .",
    "this shocked region expands very slowly as more material piles into it . in this regime the nuclear energy generation rate scales as @xmath31 .",
    "-axis in scenario 1 .",
    "this snapshot corresponds to panel 3 in figure [ fig : headon ] .",
    "the material falling into the shocked region is moving at or above the sound speed for this region , causing the shock to stall.,width=264,height=264 ]    when the high density ( @xmath32 g cm@xmath9 ) central core of each white dwarf encounters the leading edge of the shock , it raises the energy generation rate of enough material above the threshold needed to trigger a detonation ( see gamezo 1999 and references therein ) . two curved detonation fronts with @xmath33",
    "k form at the interfaces of the shocked and unshocked regions and begin to propagate ( fourth panel in figure [ fig : headon ] ) which releases enough energy to unbind the merged system ( fifth panel ) .",
    "the entire system then undergoes homologous expansion ( sixth panel ) , leaving a small amount of unburned co in the central regions surrounded by a layer of @xmath4ni and other iron - group elements , a layer of si - group elements , and then an outer region of unburned co. the final tally , with 1.2of co entering the system , is 0.34of @xmath4ni , 0.33of @xmath34si , and 0.15of unburned co with the remaining mass distributed among other heavy elements ( also see figure [ fig : convergence ] ) .",
    "such an event , whose total mass is sub - chandrasekhar , would be a potential candidate for either an underluminous snia or a new class of transients between novae and snia .      in scenario 2",
    ", we use an impact parameter of @xmath35rin order to bring the stars into contact with a final impact parameter of @xmath36r@xmath37 or @xmath38r . as in scenario 1 ,",
    "the shock front stalls as the inward falling material is traveling at a comparable speed ( first panel of figure [ fig : grazing ] ) .",
    "once again , when the cores of the white dwarfs enter the shocked region , two detonation fronts break out and unbind the system ( second panel )",
    ". however , in this case , the additional torque applied to the shocked region as the stars continue to move past each other results in off - axis and off - center detonation fronts that occur at earlier times than in scenario 1 ( second and third panels ) . in this case , 0.30of @xmath4ni , 0.37of @xmath34si are created , leaving 0.25of unburned co with the remaining mass distributed among other heavy elements .",
    "white dwarf collision scenario 2 , given in table 1 .",
    "the features of each panel are described in detail in ",
    "3.2.,width=264,height=264 ]      in scenario 3 , we increase the impact parameter to @xmath39r , resulting in a pre - collision impact parameter of @xmath40r@xmath37 or @xmath41r .",
    "this ensures a purely grazing incident , which is likely to be the the most frequent impact scenario as a wide range of impact parameters will result in a similar , grazing collision when tidal effects transfer angular momentum from passing impactors . absent the violent shock experienced in scenarios 1 and 2",
    ", there is negligible nuclear burning in a purely edge - on impact .",
    "less than @xmath42of @xmath4ni are produced by the initial interaction .",
    "the kinematics of the collision causes both stars to become unbound , forming a rotating disk of white dwarf debris , which will eventually collapse into a single compact object as it cools .      a known weakness of smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations is resolving shocks with a finite number of particles .",
    "for this reason , we carried out a convergence study of the the @xmath43 ( scenario 1 ) and @xmath36r@xmath37 ( scenario 2 ) cases in order to place upper limits on the isotope yields .",
    "figure [ fig : convergence ] shows that with increasing particle count , more of the co is converted into @xmath4ni and @xmath34si , while the abundance of @xmath44s remains relatively constant . while we did not achieve an absolute convergence in our simulations , we can reasonably extrapolate an upper limit of 0.4of @xmath4ni for the head - on merger scenario and 0.35 in the @xmath36r@xmath37 scenario , where 1.2of co enters the system . in low impact - parameter collision scenarios involving larger masses for the constituent white dwarfs ,",
    "it is very likely that this yield would increase .",
    "rosswog ( 2009 ) find 0.32 mof @xmath4ni for the head - on collision of two 0.6 mwhite dwarfs with an sph resolution of 2@xmath1910@xmath45 particles .",
    "this is consistent with our highest resolution snsph model with 8@xmath1910@xmath45 particles , but is inconsistent with our lower resolution snsph models .",
    "rosswog ( 2009 ) do not present a convergence study of their snsph models , and find significantly less @xmath4ni is synthesized when they use the finite difference code flash ( fryxell 2009 ) .",
    "we are currently using flash to calculate the nucleosynthesis for the three impact parameter cases studied in this paper to investigate this apparent discrepency and to validate ( or falsify ) the @xmath4ni yields from our snsph models ( hawley 2010 ) .",
    "r@xmath37 simulation.,width=264,height=264 ]",
    "direct collisions between white dwarfs offer an unexplored mechanism for snia production within the double - degenerate family of progenitor models .",
    "our simulations suggest that at low impact parameters , the collision between the most common white dwarf masses ( 0.6 ) can result in explosive nuclear burning , even though the total mass involved is below the chandrasekhar limit , and producing enough @xmath4ni to result in a dim snia or be an example of a new class of transients between novae and snia .",
    "it is likely that collisions between more massive white dwarfs with impact parameters less than a white dwarf radius will result in brighter events .",
    "although our simulations are unable to resolve the exact physics that trigger detonations in an open environment , these details might not be critical for the overall nucleosynthesis in collision scenarios .",
    "rosswog ( 2009 ) have reported that a low resolution @xmath46 collision of two 0.9white dwarfs can produce enough @xmath4ni to resemble the nuclear yields of a typical snia . as we ve shown above for two 0.6white dwarfs ,",
    "the nuclear yields are sensitive to the impact parameter .",
    "grazing incident collisions between more massive white dwarfs are likely to lead to similar configurations .",
    "the ultimate fate of these systems will , like their binary merger cousins , depend on the total mass , thermal and neutrono cooling rates , angular momentum transport rate , mass accretion rate onto the hot central object , and any residual nuclear burning ( yoon 2007 ) .",
    "further studies are needed to say which white dwarf collisions lead to double - degenerate ia supernovae or perhaps a new class of transients between novae and snia .",
