    "the interior structures of planets other than the earth are generally poorly constrained .",
    "although theoretical studies abound , our understanding is hampered by the lack of direct observational constraints ( see guillot 2005 , fortney & nettelman 2009 , and guillot & gautier 2014 for reviews ) . with thousands of recently discovered exoplanets / exoplanet candidates , a basic understanding of the internal structures of giant planets is more important than ever .",
    "seismology offers the best hope for directly inferring interior structures of planets .",
    "indeed , our understanding of the earth s interior owes its existence primarily to seismic measurements .",
    "we advise the interested reader to consult dahlen & tromp ( 1998 ) , hereafter dt98 , for a comprehensive description of the techniques of earth seismology .",
    "chaplin & miglio ( 2013 ) presents a review of recent developments in asteroseismology , while lognonne & mosser ( 1993 ) and stein & wysession ( 2003 ) discuss results in terrestrial seismology .",
    "unfortunately , seismic measurements of other planets are much more difficult , and no unambiguous detections of oscillations in the outer solar system planets exist ( although there are tentative detections of pressure modes in jupiter via radial velocity techniques , see gaulme et al . 2011 and discussion in section [ modeamp ] ) .",
    "saturn provides an amazing opportunity to indirectly detect global oscillation modes through their interaction with saturn s rings .",
    "marley ( 1991 ) ( m91 ) and marley & porco 1993 ( mp93 ) predicted that some of saturn s oscillation modes ( in particular the prograde f - modes ) could be detected through waves in the rings launched at lindblad resonances with the gravitational forcing created by the modes ( see also pena 2010 ) .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by hedman & nicholson ( 2013 ) ( hn13 ) , who used _",
    "data to measure the azimuthal pattern numbers @xmath2 and pattern frequencies @xmath3 of several unidentified waves within saturn s c ring .",
    "they found that the frequencies and pattern numbers matched marley & porco s predictions to within a few percent , and that the waves could not be explained by any other known process .",
    "the puzzling aspect of hn13 s findings is that there are _ multiple _ waves of the same @xmath2 near the locations predicted by m91 and mp93 , whereas only one wave was expected .",
    "the multiple waves , split by less than @xmath4 in frequency , appear to be generated by distinct oscillation modes within saturn whose frequencies are split by the same fractions . the observed splitting is not simple rotational splitting ( as this occurs between oscillation modes of different @xmath2 ) and suggests more complex physics is at play .",
    "fuller et al . ( 2014 ) ( f14 ) investigated the effect of a solid core on the oscillation mode spectrum of saturn .",
    "they found that if saturn has a large solid core that is relatively unrigid ( has a small shear modulus @xmath5 ) , the shear oscillation modes of the core can exist near the same frequencies as the f - modes that generate some of the observed waves in the rings .",
    "modes very close in frequency to the f - modes can degenerately mix with them ( a process also known as avoided crossing ) , attaining large enough gravitational potential perturbations to generate waves in the rings .",
    "however , f14 found that degenerate mixing was rare , and that only finely tuned models could qualitatively reproduce the observed mode spectrum .",
    "the oscillations of rotating giant planets have also been examined in several other works ( vorontsov & zharkov 1981 , vorontsov 1981 , vorontsov 1984 , m91 , wu 2005 , pena 2010 , le bihan & burrows 2012 , jackiewicz et al .",
    "2012 , braviner & ogilvie 2014 ) .",
    "none of these works have extensively examined the effect of stable stratification and the resulting planetary mode spectrum ( although m91 does briefly consider the effect of stable stratification on the f - mode frequencies ) .    in this paper , we examine saturn s oscillation mode spectrum in the presence of a stably stratified region deep within the planet . regions of stable stratification have been speculated to exist within giant planets due to the stabilizing effect of composition gradients ( leconte & chabrier 2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "the composition gradients could be produced by dissolution of heavy core elements in the helium / hydrogren envelope ( wilson & militzer 2012a , 2012b ) or by gravitational settling of metals ( stevenson 1985 ) or helium ( salpeter 1973 , stevenson & salpeter 1977 ) .",
    "recent simulations have sought to determine the large - scale time evolution of doubly diffusive convection produced by competing thermal / composition gradients ( rosenblum et al .",
    "2011 , mirouh et al .",
    "2012 , wood et al .",
    "2013 ) , but the resulting global structure of giant planets is unclear .",
    "figure [ satdiagram ] shows a simple schematic of the type of saturn models we consider .",
    "it should not be interpreted too strictly , it is intended only to provide the reader with a general picture of our hypothesis for saturn s interior structure .    if stably stratified regions exist , they allow for the existence of gravity modes ( g - modes ) in the oscillation mode spectrum .",
    "for stable stratification deep within the planet , the g - modes can exist in the same frequency regime as the f - modes and can strongly mix with them .",
    "this process is analogous to the mixed g - modes / p - modes observed in red giant stars , although somewhat complicated by saturn s rapid rotation .",
    "our calculations reveal that g - mode mixing can naturally explain the observed splitting between the @xmath6 waves , but can not robustly reproduce the fine splitting between the @xmath1 waves .",
    "we claim this is strong evidence for the existence of stable stratification within saturn , although some important physical ingredient ( e.g. , differential rotation ) may be required for a complete understanding .",

    "we have also pointed out the c - ring , where all of the mode - driven waves of been observed . ]",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ models ] describes the toy saturn models we use in our calculations .",
    "section [ modes ] summarizes our method of solving for oscillation modes in the presence of rapid rotation , and reviews the types of modes that exist in rotating planets . in section [ mix ] we examine the process of mode mixing induced by rotation , centrifugal , and ellipticity effects , and describe how this affects mode frequencies and eigenfunctions .",
    "section [ results ] compares our results to observations , and we conclude with a discussion of these results in section [ discussion ] .",
    "this section also addresses the issues of mode amplitudes , mode driving , and the prospects for observing saturnian and jovian p - modes via radial velocity techniques .",
    "the interior structure of giant planets is not particularly well - constrained .",
    "other than its mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 , the strongest observational constraint on saturn s interior structure is the measured value of the gravitational moment @xmath9 , which indicates that saturn must have a dense core of @xmath10 ( guillot 2005 ) .",
    "we therefore create toy models which roughly match the measured values of @xmath7 , equatorial radius @xmath11 , polar radius @xmath12 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we do not attempt to rigorously compare these models with any theoretical equations of state or microphysical models , although in section [ discussion ] we discuss how our models relate to recent theoretical developments in planetary interiors .",
    "for the purposes of our adiabatic mode calculations , the only physical quantities of importance in saturn s interior are the density @xmath13 , brunt - vaisala frequency @xmath14 , sound speed @xmath15 , gravitational acceleration @xmath16 , and spin frequency @xmath17 . to create a toy model , we proceed as follows .",
    "we first create a spherical model with a polytropic density profile of index @xmath18 , with a density profile @xmath19 .",
    "we choose a sound speed @xmath20 such that the brunt - vaisala frequency [ brunt ] n_1 ^ 2 = -g_1 - is equal to zero everywhere .",
    "we then choose inner and outer core radii @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and a core density enhancement @xmath23 .",
    "we multiply the density of the inner core by @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the density of the outer core is calculated via ( r ) = _ 1(r ) r_in < r < r_out this form is somewhat arbitrary ; we use it to obtain a smooth density increase between the envelope and inner core . in the outer core , we readjust the soundspeed such that [ cs ] c_s^2(r ) = c_s1 ^ 2(r_out ) + r_in < r < r_out . once again , this sound speed profile is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "this form ensures a positive value of @xmath26 in the outer core . because we focus only on f - modes ( for which @xmath13 is the defining quantity ) and g - modes ( for which @xmath26 is the defining quantity ) the precise value of @xmath27 has little effect on our results , except in so far as it affects the value of @xmath26 through equation [ brunt ] .    after performing the above procedure",
    ", we scale the mass and radius of our model to match that of saturn . from the profiles of @xmath13 and @xmath15 we calculate new values of @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 , and @xmath16 profiles of our reference model are shown in figure [ satmodel ] .",
    "note the value of @xmath26 is positive only in the outer core ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "consequently , g - modes are confined to the outer core in our models .",
    "this type of model is physically motivated by a scenario in which stable stratification is generated within saturn by a composition gradient between the rocky / icy inner core and the hydrogen / helium envelope .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath14 shown in figure [ satmodel ] is very typical for models containing a smooth density profile between the core and the envelope . in the stably stratified region ,",
    "the brunt - vaisala frequency has a value of @xmath29 .",
    "the dense core implied by saturn s @xmath9 entails typical values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while our models typically have @xmath32 .",

    "the radius of the spherically symmetric model is perturbed such that [ rac ] r_ac = r , where @xmath42 is the radius in the spherically symmetric model and @xmath43 is the perturbed radius .",
    "the ellipticity of the model , @xmath44 , is proportional to the small parameter @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the dynamical frequency of saturn .",

    "equation [ rac ] implies @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] , which in turn requires [ rav ] r = r_po/3 + 2 r_eq/3 .",
    "the measured polar and equatorial radii of saturn are @xmath49 cm and @xmath50 cm .",
    "equation [ rav ] then results in @xmath51 cm .",
    "this is the radius of our spherical models .",
    "we adopt a spin period of 10 hours , 34 minutes , which entails @xmath52.% , which is accurate enough for our purposes since we have excluded higher order rotational effects .",
    "see guillot & gautier 2014 for discussion . ]",
    "higher order corrections are of order @xmath53 , thus , we should expect quantities to deviate by a couple percent in a more accurate model .",
    "it is important to note that the value of @xmath54 is somewhat insensitive to the density profile of a reasonable saturn model .",
    "the value of @xmath9 , however , can vary considerably .",
    "indeed , the measured value of @xmath9 has led to the conclusion that saturn must have a core which is much denser than saturn s average density , and therefore must be enriched in ices , rocks , or metals ( guillot 2005 ) .",
    "we construct our models to have @xmath55 in accordance with the measured value of @xmath9 for saturn . will change with the addition of higher order centrifugal corrections , so we do not require our models to have a value of @xmath9 exactly equal to the measured value . ] in practice , this means choosing appropriate values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 to fulfill this constraint .",
    "saturn rotates rapidly , with @xmath56 .",
    "the rapid rotation distorts its shape away from sphericity , such that @xmath57 .",
    "these two factors greatly complicate calculations of the oscillation modes of a realistic saturn model . in this section ,",
    "we summarize our technique for calculating the mode frequencies and eigenfunctions in the presence of rapid rotation and non - sphericity .",

    "the pseudo - modes are identical to the orthogonal oscillation modes of a planetary model . adding rotation modifies the characteristics of the pseudo - modes and introduces new classes of pseudo - modes .",
    "rotation also causes the pseudo - modes to mix with one another via the coriolis / centrifugal forces .",

    "the linear and adiabatic approximations are probably very good for the small - amplitude , low wave - number modes we consider .",
    "the effect of a solid core was examined by fuller et al .",
    "some degree of differential rotation and meridional circulation likely does exist deep within saturn , however , the amplitude and structure of such flows is not well constrained , and we do not investigate this complication in detail ( but see discussion in section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the derivation of the pseudo - mode oscillation equations , and our method for solving them , are described in [ pseudo ] . including rigid rotation effects to order @xmath45 allows pseudo - modes of angular degree @xmath58 to mix with pseudo - modes of angular degree @xmath59 .",
    "we account for this mixing via the methods described in [ matrix ] . in our formalism ,",

    "rotation introduces two new classes of pseudo modes : pseudo rossby modes and pseudo inertial modes .",
    "we do not discuss p - modes , as their frequencies are too large to have lindblad resonances within saturn s rings .",
    "the f - modes , g - modes , and possibly the rossby modes and inertial modes are important for the problem at hand , and we discuss each of them below .    in the discussion that follows , it is helpful to refer to a dispersion relation . to do this",

    "g - modes also have higher frequencies for g - mode cavities at small radii @xmath42 , and for large values @xmath75 .",

    "however , this does not imply that low frequency g - modes do not exist in rapidly rotating stars / planets , as the pseudo - mode mixing process ( see section [ mix ] ) allows the normal modes to have frequencies different from the pseudo - modes .",

    "these frequency spacings are important for calculating the probability of finding g - modes with frequencies near the f - modes ( see section [ results ] ) and for understanding how modes can mix up to high values of @xmath75 ( see section [ mix ] ) .",

    "it is possible that the divergence of the wave vector of the pseudo modes is related to the wave number divergence of inertial modes at critical latitudes ( discussed in ogilvie & lin 2004 and wu 2005 ) although we do not explicitly examine this phenomenon here .",
    "because the pseudo inertial modes are restricted to the sub inertial frequency range , they all have lower frequency than saturn s f - modes , and can not undergo degenerate mixing ( avoided crossings ) with them . for this reason , we do not perform a detailed investigation of pseudo inertial modes .",
    "we note , however , that the  fundamental \" ( only one node in its radial eigenfunction ) pseudo inertial mode shown in figure [ modefunctions ] mixes relatively strongly with the f - modes because they are both localized primarily in the convective envelope .",

    "it may be simpler to use the techniques discussed in ogilvie & lin 2004 and wu 2005 .",
    "rotation also introduces a class of modes not often explored in the literature , which we refer to as pseudo rossby modes ( these modes have been explored using the traditional approximation in lee & saio 1997 , fuller & lai 2014 ) .",
    "these modes require stable stratification to exist , and are thus similar to g - modes . however , the rossby modes exist at lower frequency , and are purely _ retrograde _ modes .",

    ", the pseudo - modes are not strictly f - modes or g - modes or inertial modes , but share qualities of each . in the saturn model shown in figure [ satmodel ] ,",
    "the @xmath61 pseudo g - mode from figure [ modefunctions ] exhibits some f - mode character due to its proximity in frequency to the @xmath61 pseudo f - mode , giving it an enhanced surface potential perturbation @xmath104 . in turn",
    ", the @xmath61 pseudo f - mode has some g - mode character , causing its eigenfunction to have appear wave - like in the g - mode cavity .",
    "additionally , the inertial mode from figure [ modefunctions ] has some g - mode character .",
    "the latter mixing occurs because prograde pseudo modes in the sub - inertial frequency range behave like g - modes in stably stratified regions , and inertial modes in convective regions .",
    "this feature is responsible for the spikes in @xmath104 in figure [ modes ] at @xmath105 , which are created by gravito - inertial mixed modes near the  fundamental \" pseudo inertial mode ( the inertial mode with only one node in its eigenfunction in the convective envelope ) .",
    "as discussed above , the pseudo - modes are not normal oscillation modes because they mix with one another due to the coriolis and centrifugal forces , as well as the elliptical shape of the planet .",
    "a useful analogy to understand planetary rotational mode mixing is the mode mixing between atomic electron energy levels induced by an electric field ( the stark effect ) or a magnetic field ( the zeeman effect ) . in the limit of a weak magnetic field ,",
    "the zeeman effect splits degenerate energy levels into a multiplet .",
    "the observed frequency splitting can then be used to infer the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "similarly , in slowly rotating stars or planets , the coriolis force induces a small frequency splitting which can be used to measure the rotation rate .",
    "however , for a strong magnetic field , atomic energy levels are split by so much that they overlap with adjacent energy levels .",
    "the energy levels of different electron wave functions can not cross ( they can not be exactly degenerate ) ; instead they undergo an avoided crossing in which the modes mix with one another , exchanging character . near the avoided crossing the resulting electron wave functions are mixtures ( superpositions ) of the non - perturbed wave functions , and the energy levels ( eigenfrequencies ) of the states are similar but not exactly the same .",
    "a very similar process occurs in rapidly rotating stars and planets . in our case ,",
    "the rapid rotation of saturn perturbs f - mode eigenfrequencies enough that they overlap with neighboring g - mode eigenfrequencies . the f - modes and g - modes mix with one another , forming mixed modes that are superpositions of the f - mode and g - modes , and whose frequencies are similar but not equal .",

    "these mixing coefficients are discussed in more detail in [ matrix ] , and expressed explicitly in dt98 .",
    "strong mode mixing occurs when @xmath114 .",
    "the simplest way for this to occur is for two modes to be nearly degenerate , i.e. , for @xmath115 .",
    "we refer to this case as degenerate mode mixing , which is equivalent to saying two modes are undergoing an avoided crossing .",
    "however , strong mode mixing can occur at larger frequency separations if the value of @xmath116 is large .",
    "this typically only occurs for modes of the same type ( g - mode , inertial mode , etc . ) and with the same number of nodes in their radial eigenfunctions .",
    "mixed modes have eigenfunctions that are superpositions of the original pseudo - modes .",
    "a pseudo g - mode mixed with a pseudo f - mode obtains a contribution of @xmath117 to its eigenfunction ( where @xmath118 is the pseudo f - mode eigenfunction ) .",

    "our techniques only allow for mixing between pseudo - modes of the same @xmath58 , and pseudo - modes of @xmath59 . however , pseudo - modes with larger differences in @xmath75 may still mix indirectly through intermediary modes , as was discussed in fuller et al .",
    "2014 . as the number of intermediary pseudo - modes increases",
    ", we may expect that strong mixing becomes more difficult , although it remains possible .",
    "so , while pseudo g - modes of large @xmath75 can mix with the low @xmath75 pseudo f - modes , they need to be very close in frequency for strong mixing to occur .",
    "this idea motivates our proposal that the small frequency differences between the observed waves in saturn s rings are due to mode mixing between the low @xmath75 pseudo f - modes and larger @xmath75 pseudo g - modes .    we do not attempt to provide a detailed investigation of all the different types of mixing ( coriolis , potential , kinetic ) between all the different types of pseudo - modes ( f - modes , g - modes , inertial modes , rossby modes )",
    "here we only comment on the order of magnitude of the mixing .",
    "the maximum possible values of the mixing coefficients are of order @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",

    "low @xmath75 f - modes have largest mixing coefficients with neighboring g - modes of the same @xmath75 , and with the fundamental inertial mode .",
    "the g - modes usually mix most strongly with g - modes of @xmath123 with the same radial order @xmath81 .",
    "we can now understand how mixing between the pseudo - modes shown in figure [ modes ] will proceed .",
    "the pseudo g - modes will tend to mix with g - modes of the same radial order , i.e. , along the g - mode branches connected by lines in figure [ modes ] .",
    "the pseudo modes will also mix with modes of nearly the same frequency , i.e. , along vertical columns in figure [ modes ] .",
    "we also note that pseudo g - modes can mix with their negative frequency ( retrograde ) and rossby mode counterparts .",
    "however , since these modes are further away in frequency , the degree of mixing should be smaller .",
    "although the pseudo - modes do not experience any self - mixing due to the coriolis force of modes calculated for a non - rotating model is identical to the frequently discussed rotational frequency perturbation @xmath124 that is valid in the slow rotation @xmath125 limit . as a check on our numerical code",
    ", we confirm that the frequencies of the pseudo - modes are shifted by @xmath124 compared to modes calculated for a non - rotating model , in the limit of slow rotation .",
    "] , they do experience self - mixing due to the potential @xmath126 and kinetic @xmath127 mixing coefficients , causing their frequencies to shift .",
    "the largest frequency shifts occur for the pseudo f - modes , and are due to the centrifugal component of @xmath126 .",
    "this causes the computed normal f - modes to have frequencies roughly @xmath128 lower than their pseudo - mode counterparts .",
    "the centrifugal correction is thus crucial for obtaining f - mode frequencies within @xmath0 of the observed values .",
    "our ultimate goal is to compare our computed oscillation mode spectrum to the observed mode spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the observed spectrum is incomplete , as only modes with lindblad resonances that lie within the rings can excite observable waves .",
    "moreover , only modes with large enough gravitational potential perturbations to subtantially affect the rings can be observed .",
    "this likely means that only f - modes and g - modes undergoing avoided crossings with the f - modes can be observed .",
    "we compare our results with the six waves observed by hn13 , keeping in mind that the observed mode spectrum is incomplete .",

    "the g - mode obtains a large potential perturbation due to mixing with the f - mode , allowing its effect on the rings to be observed .",

    ", we have included the locations of the pseudo - modes ( black asterisks ) .",
    "where appropriate , we have drawn arrows from the location of the pseudo - modes to the normal modes , indicating which pseudo - modes are the dominant component of each normal mode .",
    "the arrow extending from beneath the plot originates from an @xmath145 pseudo g - mode just below the bottom of the plot . ]",
    "our saturn model was slightly fine - tuned to generate a frequency splitting of @xmath141 between the largest amplitude @xmath6 modes . however , spitting of this magnitude is very common .",
    "figures [ m3 ] and [ m4 ] show very similar splitting , in which there is a @xmath146 g - mode with frequency split by a few percent from the f - mode frequency .",
    "the models need not be fine - tuned to qualitatively reproduce this feature .",
    "the reason for such splitting is as follows .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     equation [ omspacen ] demonstrates that the frequency spacing between @xmath147 g - modes in the vicinity of the low @xmath147 f - modes is of order @xmath148 .",
    "the average spacing between an f - mode and the nearest g - mode is one quarter of the g - mode frequency spacing , i.e. , @xmath149 .",
    "the fractional frequency spacing of @xmath150 is smaller because the prograde modes are all shifted to higher frequencies in the rotating frame , such that typical frequency spacings are of order @xmath151 .",
    "it is thus quite common to have a g - mode whose frequency is within several percent of the f - mode .    in our models ,",
    "the g - modes are more strongly mixed with the f - modes for smaller values of @xmath75 .",
    "the reason is that higher @xmath75 f - modes are confined closer to the surface of the planet , away from the g - mode cavity deep in the interior .",
    "therefore , low @xmath75 f - modes mix more strongly with the g - modes , which may explain why a frequency splitting of @xmath141 is only observed near the @xmath138 , @xmath6 f - mode .",
    "such splitting also occurs in figures [ m3 ] and [ m4 ] , but only because this particular saturn model happens to have @xmath61 and @xmath152 g - modes whose frequencies are closer than average to the f - mode frequencies .",
    "nonetheless , it is very possible that there exist additional waves near the observed @xmath1 and @xmath139 waves , which have smaller amplitudes , and which are split in frequency by a few percent .",
    "let us now turn our attention to figure [ m3fancy ] .",
    "the three observed @xmath1 waves have frequencies that are split an order of magnitude less than the @xmath6 waves , i.e. , their frequencies are split by less than a percent .",
    "such splitting can not be explained by mode mixing between f - modes and neighboring g - modes of the same @xmath75 .",
    "instead , the splitting may be due to avoided crossings between the f - mode and g - modes of much higher values of @xmath75 .",
    "these avoided crossings could be very common , because the g - mode spectrum near the f - mode becomes very dense as we proceed to large values of @xmath75 ( see figure [ modes ] ) .",
    "figure [ m3 ] shows that there is a mixed mode very near the f - mode , split by @xmath153 in frequency .",
    "the frequencies @xmath134 of these two modes are listed in table [ table ] in rows c and d ( the mode in row e is the @xmath61 g - mode discussed above ) . in this case , the fine - splitting arises due to an avoided crossing between the @xmath61 f - mode and an @xmath145 g - mode .    however , we find that strong mixing between the @xmath147 f - modes and high @xmath75 g - modes is uncommon .",
    "it appears that the effective mixing coefficients are small , requiring very small frequency separations @xmath154 for strong mixing to occur .",
    "the strong mixing shown in figures [ m3fancy ] occurs because the model has been fine - tuned to produce a resonance between the @xmath61 f - mode and an @xmath145 g - mode .",
    "we find such strong mixing only occurs in about one tenth of our planet models .",
    "simultaneous strong mixing between three modes , as appears to be observed , is even less common .",
    "it is thus difficult to reconcile the observations with the notion of strong mixing between low @xmath75 f - modes and high @xmath75 g - modes , indicating that some un - included physical effects may be important ( see section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "finally , let us examine figures [ m4 ] and [ m5 ] .",
    "the @xmath152 and @xmath155 f - modes have higher frequencies , where the g - mode spectrum is less dense and where mode mixing coefficients are smaller .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that no fine splitting is observed for the @xmath139 mode .",
    "the @xmath155 , @xmath140 f - mode is not observed at all , even though our calculations suggest it should be observable .",
    "this indicates that modes of higher @xmath75 and/or higher frequency are excited to lower amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the observed @xmath139 wave is a factor of @xmath156 smaller in amplitude than our energy equipartition calculation predicts .",
    "if the amplitude of the @xmath140 f - mode is smaller by a similar factor , it would not make an observable impact on the rings , in accordance with its non - observation .",
    "we have examined the oscillation mode spectrum of saturn models with stable stratification deep in the interior .",
    "the stably stratified region supports g - modes , and we find that the g - mode spectrum extends to higher frequencies than the f - modes that generate observed waves in saturn s rings .",
    "g - modes close in frequency to the f - modes mix with them , allowing them to obtain large enough gravitational perturbations to generate waves in the rings .",
    "we have proposed that this mechanism is responsible for the observed small frequency splittings between modes of the same azimuthal number @xmath2 inferred from ring observations .",
    "if true , this requires the existence of a thick region of stable stratification deep within the interior of saturn , in contrast to the conventional notion that giant planets envelopes are convective throughout .",
    "our models very naturally reproduce the observed frequency splitting of @xmath141 between the two @xmath6 waves observed by hn13 .",
    "in fact , for g - mode cavities located deep within the planet near a `` core - envelope '' interface at @xmath157 , frequency splittings of this magnitude are difficult to avoid .",
    "neither fully convective models nor models containing shear modes in a solid core can readily produce frequency splittings of this magnitude ( see f14 ) .",
    "our results place some basic constraints on the interior structure of saturn . in order to reproduce the measured frequencies of the f - modes ,",
    "the core of saturn @xmath158 must be substantially more dense than saturn s envelope .",
    "a dense core is also required by the measured vale of @xmath9 , and it is reassuring that our seismic analysis is consistent with this constraint .",
    "more quantitative constraints are difficult because f - mode frequencies are only slightly affected by the properties of the core ( f14 ) .",
    "one must include rotational / ellipticity terms up to at least @xmath159 to calculate mode frequencies accurate enough to tightly constrain core properties .",
    "we can also place some loose constraints on the characteristics of the stably stratified region within saturn . in order for",
    "the g - modes to extend to high enough frequencies to mix with f - modes , the stable stratification must exist deep within the interior of saturn .",
    "this is most naturally achieved for stable stratification at the large density gradient between the core and envelope at @xmath160 .",
    "we also find the stable stratification must be confined to relatively small radii @xmath161 .",
    "if the stable stratification extends to larger radii , mixing between @xmath162 f - modes and g - modes seems to be too strong . in this case",
    ", we would expect the minimum frequency splitting between the @xmath6 modes to be larger than the measured value of @xmath141 .",
    "we would also expect similar frequency splitting to be observed for both the @xmath1 and @xmath139 waves , in contrast with current observations .",
    "the possible existence of stable stratification deep within giant planets has been speculated for decades ( stevenson 1985 ) and may be in accordance with recent theoretical investigations of giant planet interior structures .",
    "wilson & militzer ( 2012a , 2012b ) have claimed that ices and rocks will dissolve in liquid metallic hydrogen at temperatures expected for saturn s core .",
    "this dissolution and ensuing diffusion of heavy elements could set up a stabilizing composition gradient near the core - envelope interface , similar to the stable stratification in our saturn models .",
    "leconte & chabrier ( 2012 ) have proposed that the counteracting effects of stabilizing composition gradients and destabilizing temperature gradients set up layered double - diffusive convective regions in giant planet interiors ( see also leconte & chabrier 2013 ) .",
    "the stabilizing composition gradient leads to a real - valued brunt - vaisala frequency ( at least when averaged over many layers ) which could support g - modes .",
    "alternatively , the layers may become unstable and merge ( rosenblum et al .",
    "2011 , mirouh et al .",
    "2012 , wood et al .",
    "2013 ) , producing much thicker regions of stability / convection .",
    "we have only investigated the effect of a single stably stratified region ; the effect of alternating layers of convection / stratification on the g - mode spectrum is not clear .",
    "unfortunately , our models do not easily reproduce the frequency splittings of @xmath163 between the three observed @xmath1 waves .",
    "although such splitting can occur , it is relatively rare , only occurring in roughly one tenth of our saturn models .",
    "below , we investigate several ideas that could explain this discrepancy .",
    "_ possibility 1 : the observed finely split waves are excited by a single mode .",
    "_ there could be some dynamical mechanism that causes a single mode to excite multiple wave trains in the rings .",
    "this seems unlikely because splitting of this nature is not observed for waves excited at lindblad resonances with saturn s moons .",
    "alternatively , the splitting could be produced if there is some mechanism that periodically modulates the f - mode amplitudes or phases on a timescale of @xmath164 weeks .",
    "there are no obvious dynamical / hydrodynamical mechanisms that could produce this sort of modulation .",
    "_ possibility 2 : our saturn models are fundamentally different from saturn s interior structure . _",
    "perhaps our models lack a feature necessary to reproduce the observed mode spectrum .",
    "we have performed calculations with models containing a single density jump ( which produces a single associated interface mode , for each value of @xmath75 and @xmath2 ) and have found no improvement over simpler models .",
    "however , it may be possible that models containing many density interfaces ( or models including alternating convective / stratified layers produced by double - diffusive convection ) could better match the observations .",
    "alternatively , additional regions of stable stratification may exist within saturn , e.g. , at the molecular - metallic hydrogen phase transition or at a layer of helium accumulation due to helium rain out .    _ possibility 3 : we have not included all the necessary pseudo - mode basis functions in our calculations .",
    "_ it is possible that the inclusion of more basis functions in the matrix equation [ mat7 ] will lead to stronger mode mixing with the f - modes .",
    "we have performed various calculations that have included large @xmath75 modes @xmath165 , high radial order g - modes , negative frequency ( retrograde ) modes , inertial modes , and rossby modes .",
    "none of these additions appears to make a substantial qualitative difference in the mode spectrum near the prograde f - modes .",
    "nonetheless , it may be possible that one must include a very large number of pseudo - modes to calculate an accurate normal mode spectrum . _",
    "possibility 4 : a different mechanism causes mode splitting .",
    "_ the inclusion of magnetic fields , differential rotation , meridional circulation , non - spherical corrections to the planetary structure , non - adiabatic effects or some other bit of un - included physics could cause mode splitting .",
    "magnetic effects are unlikely to be important ( see discussion in fuller et al .",
    "2014 ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the other effects listed above can perturb mode frequencies but do not cause mode splitting .    _",
    "possibility 5 : mode mixing is enhanced by excluded physics . _ the effects listed above may substantially increase the degree of mode mixing amongst pseudo - modes , allowing strong mixing between f - modes and high @xmath75 g - modes to be more common .",
    "latitudinal differential rotation , in particular , will allow for direct mixing between pseudo - modes with @xmath166 and may make strong mixing more likely to occur .",
    "we find this option to be the most appealing out of all the possibilities listed in this section .",
    "we anticipate that future studies can either eliminate the possibilities listed above or demonstrate their validity .",
    "the detection of additional mode - driven waves in the rings would also help narrow down the possibilities .      to determine mode amplitudes ,",
    "we have simply normalized the mode amplitudes such that the @xmath61 , @xmath1 f - mode reproduces the largest observed @xmath1 wave .",
    "this entails dimensionless mode amplitudes of @xmath167 , radial surface displacements of @xmath168 cm , surface radial velocities of @xmath169 cm / s , and mode energies of @xmath170 .",
    "these amplitudes are approximately the same as those calculated by mp93 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for mode excitation remains unclear .",
    "however , we note that energy equipartition amongst modes does not appear to be consistent with observations .",
    "equipartition over - predicts the amplitude of the wave generated by the @xmath152 , @xmath139 f - mode , and predicts that the @xmath155 , @xmath140 f - mode should be observable ( but it has not been detected ) .",
    "this implies that the excitation mechanism favors low frequency and/or low @xmath75 oscillation modes .",
    "the low frequency convective motions near saturn s surface may be a good candidate for mode excitation .",
    "although energy equipartition approximately predicts the correct amplitude of the largest @xmath6 wave ( wave a in table [ table ] ) , it is possible that this wave is generated by a mixed g - mode slightly split in frequency from the @xmath138 , @xmath6 f - mode .",
    "the f - mode may instead create the maxwell gap , as originally postulated by mp93 ( see figure [ m2 ] ) .",
    "this would require the f - mode be split in frequency by less than @xmath171 from the g - mode , similar to the splitting of the @xmath1 modes .",
    "it would also imply the @xmath6 modes have amplitudes larger than suggested by energy equipartition , in accordance with the arguments above .",
    "seismological constraints would be greatly improved with the detection of p - modes via radial velocity techniques .",
    "unfortunately , if saturn s p - modes have energies similar to those of the f - modes , the surface radial velocity variation for a p - mode with angular frequency @xmath172 mhz is only @xmath173 cm / s .",
    "the apparent decrease of mode energy with frequency amongst saturn s f - modes is not encouraging for this prospect .",
    "nonetheless , we encourage searches for p - modes in saturn and jupiter , since they would provide valuable constraints on the interior structure ( jackiewicz et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "we can also compare the mode amplitudes calculated here to those claimed to be observed in jupiter via radial velocity techniques by gaulme et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . to do this",
    ", we construct a very simple jupiter model via the same method described in section [ models ] , which has a mass , radius , and @xmath9 that match those of jupiter .",
    "we then calculate @xmath138 mode eigenfunctions for p - modes with frequencies @xmath174 mhz , similar to the frequencies of the gaulme et al .",
    "( 2011 ) modes . finally , we calculate approximate mode amplitudes from the observed radial velocity variations ( of order @xmath175 cm / s ) via @xmath176 $ ] .    this procedure results in p - mode amplitudes of @xmath177 and energies of @xmath178 .",
    "as in fuller et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we find that the gaulme et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measurements entail modes that are more than a thousand times more energetic than the saturn modes ( compared to the gravitational binding energy of each planet ) .",
    "such large p - mode amplitudes seem unlikely , especially in light of the fact that the higher frequency saturn modes appear to have smaller energies .",
    "we therefore remain skeptical that the gaulme et al .",
    "( 2011 ) detections are truly due to jupiter s p - modes",
    ".    it may be possible for _ juno _ to detect the gravitational influence of jupiter s oscillation modes .",
    "the gaulme et al .",
    "( 2011 ) mode amplitudes imply potential perturbations of @xmath179 ( in units of jupiter s gravitational potential ) associated with jupiter s p - modes .",
    "however , if jupiter s f - modes have similar energies , they will generate potential perturbations of @xmath180 at periods of @xmath181 hours .",
    "juno _ may be able to detect these gravitational anomalies ( kaspi et al .",
    "if , however , jupiter s f - modes have similar energies to those of saturn ( in units of the planetary binding energy ) , the modes only produce potential perturbations of @xmath182 .      our claim that saturn contains stable stratification deep within its interior makes several testable predictions .",
    "first , our models predict that the observed modes are only the  tip of the ice berg \" , and that saturn hosts a dense spectrum of g - modes in the f - mode frequency regime ( see figures [ m2]-[m4 ] ) that are currently unobserved .",
    "observing these modes through their effect on the rings may be impossible because their gravitational perturbations are too weak to launch detectable waves in the rings .",
    "their surface displacements are correspondingly small because the modes are localized in the g - mode cavity deep within the planet , so observing them with radial velocity measurements may also be very difficult . nonetheless , their detection would be consistent with our theory .",
    "second , our models predict that there may be other , small amplitude waves in the rings excited by @xmath162 g - modes .",
    "for instance , figure [ m2 ] shows an @xmath6 g - mode with a lindblad resonance at @xmath183 km that is on the border of detectability .",
    "the exact frequencies of the detectable g - modes are not robust predictions of our model , we merely speculate that there could be other low amplitude @xmath184 waves separated from the observed waves by a few percent in frequency .",
    "there are several unidentified waves in the c - ring ( see marley 2014 ) that could be excited by these g - modes .",
    "finally , we find the arguments presented in the preceding subsection compelling enough to predict that the maxwell gap is generated by the @xmath138 , @xmath6 f - mode of saturn , as originally proposed in mp93 . indeed",
    ", there is an observed wave train on the eccentric ringlet within the maxwell gap ( porco et al .",
