    "have been identified in many globular and open clusters @xcite , as well as in the field @xcite .",
    "the currently most popular bs formation mechanisms are mass transfer in a close binary @xcite and merger of two stars induced by a close encounter @xcite .",
    "there are numerous examples of confirmed binary bs in open clusters and for a few masses of both components have been accurately established from analyses of radial and light curves ( see for example @xcite ) . in the case of globular clusters ,",
    "the sample of candidate bs includes several contact binaries @xcite as well as a sizable population of sx phe pulsating variables which have been detected in over a dozen clusters @xcite .",
    "however , until now not a single , direct mass determination is available for a binary bs belonging to a globular cluster . @xcite used @xmath6 spectra to estimate masses for 24 apparent single bs from 3 clusters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they derived an average mass of 1.07  @xmath7 with a wide range of uncertainty for the masses of individual objects .",
    "there thus seems to be evidence for both bs formation mechanisms in open and globular clusters .",
    "the eclipsing binary oglegc-228 ( hereinafter v228 ) was discovered by @xcite during a survey for variable stars in the field of the globular cluster 47  tuc .",
    "they presented a @xmath8 band light curve for the variable and found an orbital period of @xmath9  d. further @xmath10 photometry of v228 along with a finding chart was published by @xcite ( star wsb v7 in their catalog ) . on the color - magnitude diagram of the cluster , the variable occupies a position near the top of the blue straggler sequence .",
    "in this paper we report results of photometric and spectroscopic observations aimed at a determination of absolute parameters of v228 .",
    "the data were obtained as a part of a long - term case project conducted at las campanas observatory @xcite .",
    "sections  [ phot ] and [ period ] describe the photometry of the variable and an analysis of its orbital period .",
    "section  [ spec ] presents the radial velocity observations .",
    "the combined photometric and spectroscopic element solutions are given in section  [ comb ] while the membership to 47  tuc is discussed in section  [ memb ] .",
    "the last section  [ disc ] discusses the properties of v228 in the 47  tuc context .",
    "the photometric data were obtained with the 1.0-m swope telescope at the las campanas observatory using the site3 ccd camera at a scale of 0.435@xmath11/pixel .",
    "most of the images were taken with the detector subrastered to @xmath12 pixels , but occasionally we also used subrasters of @xmath13 or @xmath14 pixels . most of observations were collected during the 1997 , 1998 and 2001 observing seasons .",
    "the same set of @xmath15 filters was used for all observations .",
    "some additional data were obtained with the @xmath8 filter in 2003 and 2004 with a goal of refining the period of the system .",
    "exposure times ranged from 120  s to 200  s for the @xmath8 filter and from 180  s to 240  s for the @xmath16 filter .",
    "the raw data were pre - processed with the iraf - ccdproc package .",
    "the time series photometry was extracted using the isis-2.1 image subtraction package @xcite . to minimize the effects of a variable point spread function we used @xmath17 pixel sub - images in the analysis with the variable located in the center of the field .",
    "transformation of instrumental photometry to the standard @xmath15 system was accomplished using measurements of 198 standard stars from stetson s catalog @xcite which are present in the observed field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the @xmath15 light curves of v228 phased with the ephemeris given in the next subsection .",
    "these curves contain a total of 1199 and 274 data points for @xmath8 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the colors and magnitudes of v228 at minima and at quadratures are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the quoted errors do not include possible systematic errors of the zero points of the photometry which we estimate at about 0.01  mag .",
    "> from the available data we measured 9 times of eclipses for v228 ; their values , along with errors determined using the method of @xcite are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the first listed minimum is based on the ogle - i data from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 values listed in the table correspond to the linear ephemeris : @xmath19 determined from a least squares fit to the data .",
    "a linear ephemeris provides a good fit and there is no evidence for any detectable period change during the interval 19932004 covered by the observations .",
    "spectroscopic observations of v228 were obtained with the mike echelle spectrograph @xcite on the magellan  ii ( clay ) telescope of the las campanas observatory .",
    "the data were collected during 5 observing runs between 2003 august 16 and 2004 october 4 . for the current analysis we used the data obtained with the blue channel of mike covering the range from 380 to 500 nm with a resolving power of @xmath20 .",
    "all of the observations were obtained with a @xmath21 arcsec slit and with @xmath22 pixel binning . at",
    "4380   the resolution was @xmath232.7 pixels at a scale of 0.043   / pixel .",
    "the seeing ranged from 0.7 to 1.0  arcsec .",
    "the spectra were first processed using a pipeline developed by dan kelson following the formalism of @xcite and then analyzed further using standard tasks of the iraf / echelle package .",
    "each of the final individual spectra consisted of two 600900  s exposures interlaced with an exposure of a thorium - argon lamp .",
    "we obtained 40 spectra of v228 .",
    "for the wavelengths interval @xmath24 nm the average signal - to - noise ratios ranged between 14 and 39 , depending on the observing conditions .",
    "in addition to observations of the variable , we also obtained high s / n spectra of radial velocity template stars .",
    "we have analyzed the spectra of v228 for radial velocity variations using a code based on the broadening function ( bf ) formalism of @xcite .",
    "a spectrum of hd  138549 was used as a template . according to @xcite ,",
    "the relevant properties of hd  138549 are : @xmath25  km / s , @xmath26  km / s , @xmath27}=+0.01 $ ] and @xmath28  k. we used the spectra in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 495 nm excluding the balmer series lines .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents examples of fitting a model to the bfs calculated for two spectra taken near opposite quadratures . our radial velocity measurements of v228 are listed in table  [ tab3 ] , with last two columns giving residuals from the spectroscopic orbit solution , as presented in the next section .",
    "the current implementation of the bf method does not give reliable estimates of internal errors of the measured radial velocities ; in the following analysis the velocities for a given component were weighted according to the rms of its @xmath18 residuals from the fitted spectroscopic orbit .",
    "we analyzed the light and radial velocity curves of v228 using the wilson - devinney model @xcite as implemented in the phoebe package @xcite .",
    "we adopted an iterative scheme in which the light and radial velocity curves were fitted independently and alternately .",
    "the following parameters were adjusted in the light curve solution : the orbital inclination @xmath29 , the gravitational potentials @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the effective temperature of the secondary @xmath32 and the relative luminosities @xmath33/@xmath34 in @xmath16 and @xmath8 .",
    "the mass ratio was fixed at the value resulting from the spectroscopic solution .",
    "the temperature of the primary , @xmath35 was determined from the dereddened color index @xmath36 using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "we adopted an interstellar reddening of @xmath37 following @xcite and the metallicity @xmath38}=-0.67 $ ] from @xcite . in the first iteration ,",
    "the color index of the primary was assumed to be the same as the observed color index of the binary at the quadrature , leading to an initial @xmath39  k. in the following iterations we used the previous step solution to disentangle the magnitudes and colors of both components at the maximum light .",
    "for the primary component , the bolometric albedo and the gravitational - brightening coefficients were set at values appropriate for stars with radiative envelopes : @xmath40 and @xmath41 while for the cooler secondary we used values appropriate for stars with convective envelopes : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "an attempt was also made to solve the light curves with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but the obtained fit was substantially poorer than the one derived with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "specifically , the @xmath46 quantity increased by a factor of 2.6 and a systematic dependence of residuals on phase became apparent in both minima .",
    "in the photometric solution the mass ratio was set to the value measured from the spectroscopic solution . the free parameters in the spectroscopic solution were the semi - major axis @xmath47 , the systemic velocity @xmath48 and the mass ratio @xmath49 .",
    "the solutions were started with a detached configuration , but converged quickly to a semi - detached configuration with the secondary component filling its roche lobe .",
    "the starting value of the mass ratio was established from the ratio of the spectroscopic radial velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as derived from the preliminary sine curve fits .",
    "the derived parameters of the spectroscopic orbit are listed in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the computed radial velocity curves together with radial velocity measurements .",
    "the light curve solution is listed in table  [ tab5 ] and the residuals between the observed and synthetic light curves are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the quantities listed in the last column of table  [ tab5 ] are the weighted averages of the values obtained from the solutions for the @xmath8 and @xmath16 filters .",
    "one may notice that the parameters derived from solutions based on @xmath8 and @xmath16 photometry are consistent with each other .    using the luminosity ratios from the light curve solution one may obtain the observed visual magnitudes of the components of v228 at the maximum light .",
    "we obtained @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 where the errors represent the respective uncertainties in the solution and do not include the contribution from zero point uncertainties of our photometry of about 0.01  mag . for a reddening of @xmath37 , the de - reddened color index of the secondary component",
    "is @xmath56 which implies an effective temperature of @xmath57  k according to the calibration of @xcite .",
    "it is encouraging to see that @xmath58 derived this way is consistent with the value resulting from the light curve solution listed in table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "the absolute parameters of v228 obtained from our spectroscopic and photometric analysis are given in table  [ tab6 ] and the position of the binary on the color  magnitude diagram of 47  tuc is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the uncertainty of temperature @xmath35 includes estimated uncertainties of both the photometric zero point of @xmath59 and of the reddening of @xmath60 .",
    "the uncertainty in the reddening arises from a comparison of that commonly used for 47  tuc , @xmath37 @xcite , with the value of @xmath61 resulting from the reddening map of @xcite .",
    "before discussing the evolutionary status of v228 it is worth considering its membership in 47  tuc .",
    "the variable was included in the proper motion study of 47  tuc conducted by @xcite . according to that study",
    ", v228 ( designation # 2604 ) is a genuine proper motion member of the cluster with probability of 98.2% .",
    "the systemic velocity of the binary , @xmath62   km / s agrees with the radial velocity of 47  tuc , @xmath63  km / s @xcite . at the location of the variable  about 10 arcmin from the cluster center ",
    "the velocity dispersion of cluster stars is about 7  km / s @xcite .",
    "we conclude that v228 is a radial velocity member of 47  tuc . from the light curve solutions one may estimate the observed visual magnitudes of the components of the binary at maximum light . for the primary component we obtained @xmath64 . using @xmath65 ( see table  [ tab6 ] ) one obtains an apparent distance modulus @xmath66 for the primary component of v228 .",
    "this value is compatible with several of the recent estimates of the distance of 47  tuc which span a range @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "an attempt to obtain a distance modulus for the binary based on the luminosity of the secondary component is hampered by the difficulty to precisely account for ellipsoidal light variations .    in summary",
    ", v228 has the same proper motion and radial velocity as 47  tuc and is located at the cluster distance .",
    "we conclude that the binary is a certain member of 47  tuc .",
    "our study of the light and radial velocity curves of v228 shows that the binary belongs to the class of semi - detached , low mass , `` cool '' or `` conventional '' algol variables .",
    "several well studied systems of this kind are discussed in the literature . in particular as  eri @xcite and r",
    "cma @xcite are examples of algols with parameters closely resembling those of v228 . a comprehensive discussion of evolutionary models leading to the formation of such systems along with a summary of the observational data is given by @xcite and @xcite . an earlier but still useful review of the subject was given by @xcite .",
    "according to widely accepted scenarios , the algol systems form by mass transfer leading to the reversal of the original mass ratio of the binary so that the present primaries were originally the less massive components .    the currently secondary component of v228 is noticeably oversized and overluminous for its mass .",
    "the low value of the observed mass ratio , @xmath68 , and the overluminosity of the secondary ( exceeding 5 magnitudes ) indicate that the mass transfer occurred in the so - called case  b evolution @xcite . in such a case ,",
    "the original primary filled its roche lobe while starting its ascent onto the giant branch . its luminosity is currently generated in a hydrogen burning shell surrounding a degenerate helium core .",
    "the present mass transfer in the binary is expected to occur on a nuclear time scale . as we have shown above , observations with",
    "time base of 11 years failed to reveal any change of the orbital period of v228 .",
    "at the first sight the primary component of v228 with @xmath69 seems to be under - sized for its mass of @xmath70 .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the existing empirical mass - radius calibrations are based on stars with approximately solar composition and that stellar models of unevolved stars predict a decrease in the radius ( for a given mass ) for a lower metallicity .",
    "for example , the models of @xcite predict a zams radius of @xmath71 at @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath27=-0.705}]$ ] ) while the models of @xcite for the same metallicity predict zams radius of @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "these models also show that the bolometric luminosity of the primary is appropriate for an unevolved star with @xmath70 and the metallicity of 47  tuc . in particular , for @xmath73 and mass @xmath75 @xcite",
    "give @xmath76 .",
    "the absolute parameters of v228 have implications for the current turnoff mass of 47  tuc . according to the evolutionary model developed by sarna ( in preparation ) , the binary entered the phase of mass transfer about 0.2  gyr ago .",
    "based on the current total mass of the system of 1.71@xmath77 we may infer that the original primary had a mass exceeding @xmath78 .",
    "this is a conservative lower limit assuming a scenario with perfectly conservative mass transfer .",
    "isochrones from @xcite for @xmath79}=+0.3 $ ] and the age of 14  gyr have turn - off masses of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath27}=-0.606 $ ] and @xmath27}=-0.707 $ ] , respectively",
    ". the observed parameters of v228 together with an evolutionary interpretation of its current status suggest an upper limit to the age of 47  tuc of 14  gyr . this can be compared with a recent age estimate of the cluster by @xcite .",
    "they obtained an age of 10.8  gyr using models with diffusion and an age of 11.2  gyr for models with no diffiusion .",
    "if the cluster age is indeed close to 11  gyr then one has to conclude that the mass transfer in v228 resulted in a mass loss from the system .    for old stellar systems like 47  tuc ,",
    "it is expected that relatively more massive stars such as binaries should sink into the core region due to mass segregation .",
    "apparently this is not the case of v228 .",
    "located at a projected distance @xmath82  arcsec or 28 core radii from the cluster center , v228 belongs to the `` external '' sub - population of the cluster blue stragglers as defined by @xcite .",
    "the observed spatial distribution of the blue straggler population in 47  tuc was studied in detail by @xcite . on the basis of extensive simulations they concluded that a sizeable fraction of these objects is formed in the outer regions of the cluster from primordial binaries experiencing mass - transfer , induced purely by stellar evolution .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the recent detection of a sub - population of carbon / oxygen depleted blue stragglers in 47  tuc @xcite . in that context",
    "it would be worth determining the orbital parameters of v228 in the cluster . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the determination of accurate proper motions for stars in 47  tuc is possible from hst images with a time base of a few years .",
    "unfortunately the hst archive does not contain any images of the v228 field .    in section  [ memb ]",
    "we estimated the distance of v228 to check its membership in the cluster .",
    "one may use the reverse approach and use the binary to obtain a distance estimate for the cluster .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty arises from estimates of the effective temperature and bolometric correction from the color index @xmath83 .",
    "the surface brightness method may provide a more robust and secure determination of distance to v228 than available from our data @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent progress in the interferometric techniques has resulted in substantial improvement of precise calibrations of surface brightness in the near - ir bands @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to obtain ir photometry for v228 for an accurate and independent 47  tuc distance determination .",
    "to summarize , we have used photometric and spectroscopic observations of the blue straggler v228 , a member of the globular cluster 47  tuc , to derive the masses , radii , and luminosities of the component stars .",
    "the resulting masses indicate that v228 is a blue straggler which formed through a mass transfer in a close binary system .",
    "we derive an upper limit of 14 gyr for the turnoff age of 47  tuc .",
