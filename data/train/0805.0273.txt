    "flat directions are prevalent in the mssm @xcite and in its simplest extensions .",
    "scalar fields can develop a large vev along a flat direction during inflation @xcite , though in supergravity models , this typically requires a nonminimal kahler potential @xcite .",
    "if large field values are excited , flat directions can have several important effects in cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , in the presence of a non - vanishing baryon number violating operator , the flat direction may be associated with a finite baryon number density and could account for the production of the baryon asymmetry of the universe through the affleck  dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that the flat directions may also affect the thermal history of the universe after inflaton decays @xcite .",
    "there are two main effects .",
    "first there is the delay of the thermalization of the inflaton decay products ( resulting in a low reheat temperature ) due to the fact that the vev of the flat directions provides a large mass to gauge bosons , which in turn suppresses the rates of the processes needed for thermalization @xcite .",
    "the second effect is that the oscillations of the flat directions can come to dominate over the ( relativistic ) inflaton decay products @xcite , so that the relevant stage of reheating is associated with the decay of the flat directions , rather than that of the inflaton field .    for definiteness",
    "we assume that there is only a single mass scale associated with the inflaton potential , set by the cobe normalization @xcite to be about @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the planck scale ) .",
    "we also assume that the inflaton couples to the visible sector only through gravity .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , under these circumstances , the delay of the thermalization of the inflaton decay products takes place only if the vev of the flat direction generated during inflation satisfies @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a characteristic coupling strength between fermions and the gauge bosons ( hence , of order of the gauge fine structure constant ) and @xmath6 the mass of the flat direction . for @xmath7 , and for @xmath8 ( since the mass comes from soft susy breaking terms ) this gives @xmath9 .",
    "it was also shown that the energy density of the flat directions comes to dominate over that of the inflaton decay products for @xmath10 .    for our canonical choices of masses ,",
    "the two conditions turn out to be the same .",
    "that is , the vevs of the flat directions need to be very large to produce a delay in thermalization or for the flat directions to dominate the energy density . a limit on the vev of flat directions",
    "may be derived from higher - order superpotential terms of the form @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "gauge invariance can protect mssm flat directions and for each class of flat directions there is a minimum value of @xmath13 for which the flat direction is lifted @xcite .",
    "no mssm flat direction is protected beyond @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , the fact that such terms are allowed by gauge invariance , does not imply that they are indeed in the superpotential , since their presence is model - dependent ( they may for instance be forbidden by additional symmetries ) .",
    "these non - renormalizable terms , if present , can be used to determine the vev along a flat direction during inflation . given sufficient time ,",
    "a vev of order @xmath15 is generated , though typical inflationary models built on a single scale will produce a vev of order @xmath16 @xcite . in order to obtain a vev as large as @xmath17",
    ", we must require that nonrenormalizable terms with low @xmath13 are absent .",
    "for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , we find that all terms with @xmath20 must be absent .",
    "it should be noted , however , that loop corrections in supergravity during inflation may lead to much larger vevs , particularly in models of the no - scale form @xcite .",
    "delayed thermalization and/or domination by flat direction requires that the flat directions themselves are long - lived . as pointed out in @xcite this appears to be the case if one only considers the perturbative decay of the flat directions .",
    "the perturbative decay rate of flat directions is suppressed by their large vev , @xmath21 @xcite . for @xmath22 ,",
    "one finds indeed that the perturbative decay of the flat directions takes place after they dominate .",
    "more specifically , one finds @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since the typical timescale for an oscillation of a scalar field along a flat direction prior to decay is @xmath24 , one finds that flat directions perform about @xmath25 oscillations before their perturbative decay .    however , it may be possible that the decay of a flat direction vev is controlled by nonperturbative effects .",
    "this possibility was first discussed in @xcite , where it was assumed that the scalar field along a flat direction has an interaction of the type @xmath26 with another scalar field @xmath27 .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the flat direction then results in a time dependent effective mass for @xmath27 . in principle",
    ", this interaction could lead to a nonadiabatic variation of the frequency for @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 , and , consequently , to the nonperturbative production of @xmath29 at the expense of the energy stored along the flat direction .",
    "such an effect is often included for the inflaton field , leading to nonperturbative inflaton decay or preheating @xcite .",
    "it was , however , found that this effect is absent in the case of flat directions .",
    "the reason being , that contrary to the case of inflation , flat directions are complex fields that typically do not pass through @xmath30 during their `` oscillations '' .",
    "therefore , the frequency @xmath31 is always large enough to ensure that @xmath32 at all times .",
    "although formally correct , this conclusion heavily relies on the assumed coupling @xmath26",
    ". however , the couplings of mssm flat directions to other fields is much more complicated than this , and may give rise to nonperturbative effects not considered in @xcite . in particular , the d - term potential results in a large nondiagonal and time dependent mass matrix for several mssm fields which depends on the ( time dependent ) background of the flat directions .",
    "even if the eigenvalues of such a mass matrix are constant , or slowly evolving , this mass matrix `` rotates '' ( in field space ) due to the rotation of the flat directions in their complex plane .",
    "such an effect can result in a very strong ( exponential ) production of mssm fields , at the expense of the energy density stored in the flat directions , which therefore would decay on a much quicker timescale ( @xmath33 rotations ) than that suggested by the perturbative decay rate @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the non - perturbative decay of a flat direction vev requires the presence of two or more simultaneous flat directions . in the case of a single direction ,",
    "the rotation of the flat direction in its complex plane can be absorbed by a gauge redefinition .",
    "this should not be seen as a serious problem , since it is easy to verify that only in exceptional cases does a single flat direction exclude all others from being excited .",
    "therefore , if the conditions in the early universe allowed the formation of a large vev for a flat direction ( sufficiently long phase of inflation , a nonminimal kahler potential , and absence of the nonrenormalizable interactions of low orders ) , then one should conclude that a system of non - mutually exclusive flat directions developed large vevs .",
    "for the case of multiple flat directions , it was shown @xcite that for several simple cases the number of degrees of freedom involved is sufficiently large that the mixing in field space remains even after all the gauge redundancy has been removed .",
    "however , the actual computation of the decay was performed only in toy models , characterized by a potential for the fields that has the same structure of the mssm d - term potential : in such models , the flat directions experienced very rapid nonperturbative decay .",
    "the computation of the decay in complete models , with all the gauge interactions properly taken into account was postponed to a separate publication , and that is the main goal of the present work .",
    "as we will see , the result of the detailed calculation presented here agrees with those of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : models ] , we introduce u(1 ) and su(2 ) models with one and two flat directions , and we motivate why multiple flat direction models are necessary in order to undergo nonperturbative decay . in section  [ sec : formalism ]",
    "we outline the formalism for computing this decay , discuss under what conditions a large effect can be expected . in section  [ sec : decay ]",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the models introduced in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "this study allows us to clarify why the nonperturbative production that we are studying is absent in the single flat direction case , but is instead present for multiple flat directions . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our numerical results for the particle production when two flat directions are excited .",
    "the computation is summarized in the discussion section  [ sec : discussion ] , where we also compare our results with others that have appeared in the literature after @xcite .",
    "the paper is concluded by a number of appendices , in which we collect some of the technical steps of our calculations .",
    "in this section , we present the models considered in this work .",
    "these are specific models of gauged u(1 ) and su(2 ) flat directions .",
    "we derive the light degrees of freedom in the unitary gauge which can play a role in the non - perturbative decay of the fields excited along the flat directions .",
    "we first consider a u(1 ) gauge theory with two fields of charge @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with lagrangian   @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the dominant potential term , originating from a d - term , is @xmath38 which admits the flat direction @xmath39 . in the unitary gauge",
    ", this theory has @xmath40 degrees of freedom : the three polarizations of the gauge boson , two light modes , corresponding to the real and imaginary part of the excitations along the flat direction , and one massive higgs .",
    "this decomposition is worked out in detail in appendix [ app : oneu1 ] .",
    "we expand the scalar fields about some background value @xmath41 , for which the d - term potential ( [ pot2 ] ) vanishes : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . inserting these expansions in the potential ( [ pot2 ] )",
    ", one finds that the light modes are defined by @xmath44 .",
    "these fields can be rotated into the real and the imaginary excitations of the flat direction itself .",
    "they are decoupled from the other fluctuations at the linearized level , and their eigenfrequencies vary only adiabatically with time .",
    "therefore , such fields do no undergo parametric resonance .",
    "the transverse components of the vector fields are also decoupled at the linearized level . on the contrary ,",
    "the longitudinal component is coupled to the higgs field . however , as we show below , this coupling is strongly suppressed by the smallness of the flat direction mass ( with respect to its amplitude ) and can be neglected in the physically relevant cases .",
    "therefore , all four of the massive fluctuations can be thought as decoupled from each other .",
    "their mass terms are of the form @xmath45 where the higgs fluctuation @xmath46 is obtained from the combination @xmath47 ( see below ) .",
    "the equality of the mass of the higgs and of the gauge boson is due to the fact that the model is chosen to reproduce the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric theory .",
    "actually , the masses of these fields receive additional contributions from the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms @xmath48 of the two scalars , which are however much smaller than the amplitude @xmath49 and can be ignored for now .",
    "these terms break the degeneracy between the masses of the gauge boson and the higgs .    the potential ( [ pot1 ] )",
    "leads to the time dependent effective mass of @xmath46 and @xmath50 @xmath51 in analogy to what has been computed for inflationary preheating @xcite , one can investigate if the time variation of the mass is quick enough to lead to nonperturbative particle production .",
    "this nonperturbative decay of the background fields takes place whenever the frequency of the quanta varies nonadiabatically , @xmath52 .",
    "for relatively small momenta @xmath53 , one finds @xmath54 , and thus @xmath55 using @xmath56 , since this is the scale that governs the dynamics of the background . since , @xmath57 is of order the electroweak scale , while @xmath41 is close to the planck scale , it is difficult to construct a situation in which this quantity becomes near unity . based on this consideration  @xcite ,",
    "it was concluded  @xcite that the flat direction decays only perturbatively , leading to a suppressed reheating temperature and a solution to the gravitino problem .",
    "however , this conclusion strongly depends on the coupling  ( [ pot1 ] ) assumed in these analyses , and in the resulting mass term  ( [ mass1 ] ) . in several concrete cases ,",
    "the coupling is more complicated .",
    "this is indeed the case if more flat directions are present . to see this , we add two more fields to the lagrangian also of charge @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( other choices are possible as well ) , and write the d - term contribution to the potential , @xmath58 we discuss the case in which two flat directions are present in this model ( notice that three flat directions are also possible ) .",
    "there are ten real modes around these directions ( coming from the four complex scalars and the gauge boson ) ; in the unitary gauge , they can be decomposed as follows ( see appendix [ app : twou1 ] for the detailed computation ) : three are associated with the massive vector , four provide shifts to the two flat direction vevs , and the three remaining degrees of freedom ( one heavy and two light ones ) are coupled to each other in a higgs mass matrix .",
    "the longitudinal component of the vector field is also coupled to these fields , so this is actually a system of four coupled fields ; however - analogously to what happens for the single flat direction case - this coupling turns out to be negligible in the regime of small masses vs. amplitudes that we are interested in .",
    "denoting the flat direction vevs by @xmath41 and @xmath59 , the higgs mass matrix possesses a heavy part proportional to @xmath60 ( and @xmath61 ) which originates from the d - term  ( [ pot3 ] ) , and a light part composed of soft supersymmetry breaking masses @xmath62 as well as terms of order @xmath63 and @xmath64 which appear from gauge fixing and from making the kinetic terms canonical . the light terms also come with time dependent prefactors such as @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ". the resulting time dependence of the higgs mass matrix in general can not be removed by a field redefinition , and so all of the eigenmasses retain this time dependence .",
    "the spectrum consists of one heavy state and two light states of order @xmath67 and in the limit of zero momentum , they all oscillate at the frequency @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for momenta lower or comparable to the supersymmetry breaking masses , @xmath68 which suggests a nonadiabatic evolution of these light states .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that the corresponding eigenvectors of these light states @xmath69 will execute relatively fast rotation in the space they span , @xmath70 which can also lead to nonadiabatic evolution .",
    "the second effect was highlighted in @xcite , and it is discussed in detail in sections  [ sec : formalism ]  and  [ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "both effects must be considered when there are multiple fields involved in the higgs mass matrix .",
    "this argument for nonadiabatic evolution relies upon the existence of light eigenstates in the higgs mass matrix and also on their time dependence .",
    "the existence of these light states is not uncommon in the presence of multiple flat directions .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was shown that the simultaneous presence of the two flat directions @xmath71 and @xmath72 results in a higgs mass matrix with time dependent light states mixed with one heavy state .",
    "it is expected that the results  ( [ adiabatic1 ] )  and  ( [ adiabatic2 ] ) will be valid also for this case .",
    "it must be stressed that the rapid change of the light states is not guaranteed , and in particular it will be suppressed when the ratio @xmath73 is very large or very small . in these limits , there is a suppression in the higgs mass matrix via the above mentioned factors @xmath74 and @xmath66 .",
    "a suppression of this kind was also noted in @xcite , but a concrete calculation of the effects was not performed .",
    "our numerical studies indicate that even if the ratio of maximum values of the vevs is as large as @xmath75 , the ratio @xmath73 is still of order one during some short periods of time .",
    "we find that even in cases such as this , there is sufficient nonadiabatic evolution during these short periods of time to result in the rapid decay of the flat direction .",
    "this effect will be demonstrated in section  [ sec : results ] .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we discuss the background evolution as well as the symmetries of the background under changes in the initial conditions and parameters .",
    "for the two field case , we consider the potential @xmath76 where the last term is the d - term potential ( [ pot2 ] ) , while @xmath77 is a soft supersymmetry breaking mass of order the electroweak scale .",
    "this potential admits the d - flat direction with vev assignments @xmath78 . will result in flat direction vevs with more complicated time evolution . ]",
    "the quartic term proportional to @xmath79 may be present due to one loop contributions to the effective potential and are assumed to have magnitude @xmath80 in analogy to the baryon number violating operators in the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath81 is the flat direction vev at the time the flat direction begins its oscillation .",
    "these terms provide an initial angular motion in the complex plane and become subdominant to the other terms in the action as the universe expands .",
    "the vev subsequently spirals down slowly to the origin as discussed in detail below . without the quartic terms",
    ", the dynamics of the flat direction vev would be a straight line trajectory in the complex plane through the origin .",
    "the cosmological context for the evolution of the flat directions , is a universe initially dominated by the scalar field oscillations of the inflaton before it decays .",
    "thus initially we assume a matter dominated universe with the dominant contribution being in the inflaton energy density @xmath82 .",
    "we then have the background equations of motion @xmath83 where we have assumed a friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xmath84 in which @xmath85 is the scale factor .",
    "as we will see , it will be convenient to express the flat direction in terms of two scaled real scalar fields , @xmath86 the equations of motion may be rewritten using conformal time @xmath87 with @xmath88 as , @xmath89 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time , and where the friedmann equations were combined in a way so as to eliminate the kinetic terms for the scalar fields .",
    "this form  ( [ scalarbackground2 ] ) of the background equations is used for our numerical analyses shown below .",
    "the background equations of motion possess two symmetries .",
    "given a solution @xmath90 to the equations  ( [ scalarbackground1 ] ) with initial value @xmath91 , and recalling that @xmath92 , we see that @xmath93 , with @xmath94 a real constant , is also a solution to the equations of motion .",
    "thus , changing the initial value for the field , only changes the solution through a scale change .",
    "the background equations have a second symmetry under a change of the soft mass @xmath95 , with @xmath96 real .",
    "now , @xmath97 is a solution to the new background equations of motion . thus changing the mass parameter in the equations only changes the timescale on which the solution evolves .",
    "both symmetries will be shown in section  [ sec : discussion ] to translate into approximate symmetries for the decay of the flat directions .  ) from the energy density of the flat direction .",
    "the initial energy of the inflaton field is chosen so that the flat direction is initially at rest due to hubble friction .",
    "the flat direction starts evolving when the hubble parameter @xmath98 drops below its mass . starting with a higher value for @xmath82",
    "simply amounts in waiting for a longer time before this evolution starts . therefore , under the rescaling @xmath99 , we also rescale @xmath100 . ]",
    "this model can be extended to the four fields model with potential @xmath101 characterized by the d - term potential ( [ pot3 ] ) , soft supersymmetry breaking terms , and quartic interactions .",
    "this model admits the two flat directions characterized by the vevs @xmath102 .",
    "the background equations of motion are an immediate extension of  ( [ scalarbackground2 ] ) ; we simply have two copies of the first two equations in  ( [ scalarbackground2 ] ) ( one copy for the amplitude and the phase of @xmath41 , and one for the amplitude and the phase of @xmath103 ) , while the last equation in  ( [ scalarbackground2 ] ) only changes in the sense that the potential for both fields is present on the right hand side . since @xmath92 , and @xmath104 , the system possesses the same symmetries of the previous case under the simultaneous rescalings @xmath105 or @xmath106 .    in this work ,",
    "we study the decay of the background flat direction(s ) into the fields involved in the potentials ( [ pot4 ] ) and ( [ pot5 ] ) .",
    "we do so by studying the linearized theory for the perturbations , and by studying whether the system of fluctuations undergoes nonperturbative production due to the coherent motions of the flat direction(s ) .  .",
    "] this linearized computation can be extended to nonabelian flat directions of physical interest , as for instance su(n ) flat directions .",
    "the reason for this is that the differences due to the nonabelian structure only arise at higher than quadratic order in the gauge fields .",
    "such interactions are not present at the linearized study of fluctuations , as long as the gauge fields involved do not have any background expectation value .    for simplicity , we focus on the su(2 ) case .",
    "consider the model with potential @xmath107 + \\frac{e^2}{2}\\sum_a \\left(\\phi_1^ * \\tau^a \\phi_1 + \\phi_2^ * \\tau^a \\phi_2\\right)^2 \\label{pot6}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 are su(2 ) doublet indices , and the @xmath109 are the gauge generators @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 are the pauli matrices ) .",

    "each higgs is coupled to one longitudinal boson and two light fields exactly as for two u(1 ) flat directions .    due to this correspondence between the linearized u(1 ) and su(2 )",
    "( which can be generalized to su(n ) ) systems , it is sufficient to explicitly perform the numerical computations only for the u(1 ) cases .",
    "here we outline the formalism of @xcite which is necessary to quantify the rate of the nonperturbative decay of flat directions .",
    "we begin with a lagrangian with an arbitrary number of real scalar fields @xmath115 and with a time dependent mass matrix @xmath116 , @xmath117 where we are using the conformal time @xmath87 , and derivatives with respect to conformal time are again denoted with a prime .",
    "one may diagonalize @xmath118 with a time dependent rotation matrix @xmath119 , @xmath120 the eigenfrequencies of the system are the elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the momentum .",

    "in addition , the bogolyubov coefficients obey the constraints , @xmath132 and the occupation number of the ith state can be shown to be , @xmath133 note that the gamma matrix may be written in terms of the eigenstates @xmath124 and its elements contain the information for the rate of change of the eigenstates , @xmath134 there are two qualitatively different parts to the evolution equations  ( [ bogequations ] ) ; a  unitary \" part represented by the anti - hermitian matrices @xmath135 and a  nonunitary \" part represented by the symmetric matrix @xmath136 . whenever the nonunitary part vanishes , the total occupation number given by @xmath137 $ ] is conserved .",

    ". it will be convenient to rewrite the evolution equations  ( [ bogequations ] ) by extracting factors of @xmath140 , @xmath141 the equations are now written entirely in terms of the following matrices , @xmath142 one recognizes the diagonal part of @xmath143 as the adiabatic parameter from the single - field analysis .",
    "the off - diagonal parts of this matrix may also be interpreted as adiabatic parameters as follows .",
    "one expects nonadiabatic evolution when either the oscillation frequency of the physical state or the field composition of the state ( its eigenvector ) has changed faster than its period @xmath144 .",
    "the latter condition on the field composition is clearly relevant only if there are two or more fields from which the state is composed .",
    "non - adiabatic evolution occurs when the condition  ( [ adiabatic2 ] ) is satisfied , @xmath145 or more specifically when , @xmath146 this condition is not quite correct however , since in the case of degenerate eigenstates , the eigenvectors have no preferred directions in their subspace , and so the rate of change of these eigenvectors in this subspace is not physically meaningful .",
    "this feature is taken into account by the @xmath143 matrix ( as well as the @xmath131 matrix ) which has the form , @xmath147 and it handles both limiting cases , @xmath148 so for nondegenerate frequencies the condition ( [ adiabaticguess ] ) is asymptotically true .",
    "we thus take the elements of @xmath143 as our adiabatic parameters .",

    "moreover , the off - diagonal quartic term , already subdominant at the start , quickly becomes negligible as the flat direction starts evolving .",

    "we see that the production of particles is extremely fast , provided the initial amplitudes of the two flat directions are not too different .",
    "not surprisingly , a flat direction with a significantly smaller amplitude can be neglected , so that one is effectively back to the single flat direction case , for which we know that particle production is absent .",

    "the fact that particle production takes place whenever the two directions have comparable amplitude does not mean that the two amplitudes need to be equal ( or nearly equal ) initially .",
    "this is due to the fact that the orbits of the two flat directions are strongly elliptical ( cf .",

    "we actually see that the central point of this interval moves to larger values of @xmath255 as @xmath256 increases .",
    "to understand this , imagine that the second direction is heavier than the first one . then , there is an interval of time during which the first direction is frozen , while the second one evolves ( these are the times for which @xmath257 ) . during this interval , the amplitude of the second direction ( more appropriately , the maxima and the minima of the amplitude ) decreases , due to hubble friction , as @xmath258 , while the amplitude of the first direction remains constant .",

    "in this paper , we have computed the nonperturbative decay of systems of multiple flat directions .",
    "our results agree with the conclusions found in @xcite . however , we improve over that study by including gauge fields in the computation .",
    "we worked out in detail the production of particles for systems with one or two u(1 ) flat directions .",

    "we also showed that this computation can be readily applied to su(n ) directions , as long as the gauge fields do not develop background expectation values .",
    "technical difficulties associated with this study revolved around the fact that one needs to find the spectrum of the fluctuations around a time dependent background .",
    "firstly , one finds that , even in the unitary gauge , the longitudinal component of the gauge boson remains coupled to the `` matter '' fluctuations ( the higgs and light fields ) at the linearized level .",
    "this coupling was not included in the analogous computations of @xcite , which adopt a gauge choice equivalent to that chosen here",
    ". however , this coupling needed to be included for consistency , and forced us to perform some field redefinitions ( see appendix [ app : twou1 ] for details ) .",
    "secondly , the quadratic action for the perturbations contains nonstandard quadratic kinetic terms , and `` mixed kinetic terms '' of the type @xmath262 , where the matrixes @xmath180 and @xmath263 depend on the background and are therefore time dependent .",
    "we provide a general formalism to diagonalize ( and eventually quantize ) such system , which is a necessary step to compute particle production .",
    "in particular , we show how particle production can be obtained without explicitly performing the rotation that eliminates the mixed term proportional to @xmath263 .",
    "thirdly , the resulting system of equations for particle production is too involved to be solved analytically . in the case of two flat directions ,",
    "the relevant computation can be reduced to a complicated system of four coupled fields . to compute particle production",

    "the results of these evaluations showed that the particle production exhibits a clear scaling with @xmath160 ( we also presented several analytic arguments in support of the observed scaling ) .",
    "the most important outcome is that the non adiabaticity in the evolution of the eigenmasses and the eigenvectors is not suppressed in the limit of @xmath266 , as was the case for the toy models considered in @xcite . as a consequence",
