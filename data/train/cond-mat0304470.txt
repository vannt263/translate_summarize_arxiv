    "the distance between stripes changes by a factor two .",
    "therefore , any mechanism of pairing via stripes must be independent of the distance between stripes .",
    "the difficulty of achieving such a mechanism can be appreciated by thinking of stripes as a periodic arrangement of ladders :    the mechanism of pairing in stripes is supposed to operate on each stripe independently . therefore , the same mechanism should manifest itself in a single ladder model where the number of legs of the ladder is determined by the stripe period . since the stripe period change from 4 to 8 lattice spacings between doping @xmath5 and @xmath6 , it implies that a mechanism of pairing in stripes should be such that the pairing of mobile fermions in the corresponding 4-leg and 8-leg ladder models be the same ! !",
    "indeed , the model and mechanism which we propose is aiming to achieve exactly that .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig-eps-stripeimage.eps    in order to have a sharp goal in mind , we pose the following theoretical question : is it possible to have a spin gap in an even - leg doped ladder which is several times bigger than the spin gap of the same undoped ladder ?",
    "numerical investigation @xcite seem to indicate that the answer is negative on uniform ladders . in this paper",
    ", we investigate non - uniform ladder models .",
    "one idea in this direction is to make the bond interactions inhomogeneous .",
    "arrigoni & kivelson @xcite considered a 4-leg hubbard ladder model where the bare hopping interaction was dimerized transverse to the ladder ( while maintaining the same uniform hopping interactions along all the legs ) .",
    "they showed that indeed the maximum spin gap of the doped ladder may increase substantially .",
    "we introduce an inhomogeniety not in the interactions but instead in the on - site chemical potential .",
    "e.g. , for t - j type ladders the model is characterized by three parameters @xmath7 . in fig.2",
    "we draw a 3-leg and 6-leg ladder versions of our models . to begin with ,",
    "we shall discuss the ladder model from a purely technical perspective and defer the discussion of its association with the stripe state to the concluding section of this paper .",
    "the simplest anisotropic ladder model consists of a chemical potential shift @xmath8 in two neighboring legs of an n - leg ladder .",
    "consequently , holes are preferentially concentrated in these two legs .",
    "hence , upon doping by holes away from half filling , the chemical potential difference leads to an inhomogeneous distribution of the holes .",
    "we argue that a significant renormalization of interactions leads to an effective phase separation of the system into two incoherent subsystems at intermediate temperatures @xmath9 - one is a doped 2-leg t - j ladder , and the second is an undoped @xmath10 leg ladder .",
    "this decoupling effect is the main effect which leads to a high energy pairing scale .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the inhomogeniety of the hole distribution in the ladder due to the confining potential whose strength is characterized by @xmath8 . at lower temperatures @xmath11 coherence",
    "is established by the proximity effect . as we discuss in section - iv , this lower temperature coherence is related to the superconducting @xmath12 .",

    "upon doping , the system separates into a doped 2-leg ladder and an undoped 4-leg ladder .",
    "i.e. , the minimal spin gap in the system is increased to the order of a 4-leg ladder spin gap @xmath13 ( i.e. , a five fold increase compared with the undoped 6-leg ladder gap @xmath14 ! ) .",
    "this can be check by numerical simulation methods such as dmrg and core @xcite .",
    "an additional conjectured property of our model is the following : the pairing energy of the holes is that of a two leg ladder , and largely independent of the spin correlations in the remaining undoped legs of the ladder .",
    "this should also be amenable to numerical experiments .",
    "the above proposed numerical experiments can quantitatively test our proposed model , yet , in the following section we would like to develop the reader s analytical intuition about the competition and renormalization of interactions in the model . instead of directly thinking of the dynamic decoupling of a ladder system into two incoherent sub - systems ,",
    "let us think of the reverse route : consider two 1d systems - one is a doped 2-leg hubbard ladder and the second is an undoped or lightly doped n - leg hubbard ladder . turning on hopping interaction @xmath15 between the two ladders , there is a competition between the intra - ladder interaction which maintains the spin gap ( and pairing ) on the 2-leg ladder and inter - ladder interactions which form coherence across the whole coupled system .",
    "similar issues of confinement / deconfinment have risen in the context of coupling _ equivalent ladder _",
    "systems where the _ tuning parameter is inter - ladder interactions _ ( e.g. , @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) .",
    "in contrast , our model starts with _ uniform _ _ bare interactions _ ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) _ _ while inhomogeniety of doping induced by _ tuning an inhomogeneous chemical potential_. we argue that similar confinement / deconfinment competition of intra- and inter- ladder interactions is at play .",
    "we would like to demonstrates this competition of interactions and the core effect where a spin gap and pairing is established on a sub - part of the system and it s spin degrees of freedom decouple from the rest of the system which may remain gapless .",
    "such an effect is unique to models of coupled _ inequivalent _ 1d systems .",
    "below we examine the simplest model of such type .",
