    "quantum turbulence , the seemingly chaotic motion of quantized vortex lines in a disordered network , is a prominent characteristic of superfluid @xmath1he - ii , where it has been known to exist for almost half a century.@xcite up to recently , @xmath1he - ii was the only superfluid system in which this phenomenon has been investigated .",
    "@xmath1he - ii is believed to display turbulence in the entire superfluid temperature range which so far has been probed with measurements . in superconductors friction in vortex motion is always high and turbulence is not observed : only in the extreme clean limit one might hope to see any signs of other behavior . at present the closest superconducting analogues",
    "are dynamically driven vortex avalanches.@xcite    superfluid @xmath0he is an intermediate case between these two extremes .",
    "the dynamics of vortex motion in the @xmath0he superfluids has primarily been studied in rotating cryostats . in the past",
    "the generally accepted view was that the high mutual friction leads to exponentially damped motion and forces vortices to evolve rapidly along well defined trajectories , so that the number of vortex lines remains conserved in dynamic processes .",
    "a large number of measurements over the years has proven this to be the case in both @xmath0he - a and @xmath0he - b at @xmath4.@xcite    even at low temperatures ( @xmath5 ) a duplication of the classic vinen - vibrating - wire measurement@xcite verified that in @xmath0he - b stable vortex motion persists for hours in the absence of applied flow . in this experiment superfluid circulation",
    "was trapped around a thin wire suspended along the symmetry axis of a cylindrical container while the cryostat was rotating .",
    "when rotation was stopped , the trapped circulation started to unwind while a vortex filament , stretched between the wire and the cylinder wall , precessed around the wire and spiraled down along the whole length of the 15 mm long cylinder .",
    "the precessing spiral motion lasted for more than 35h and the precession frequency remained constant with a precision of 0.5% .",
    "the first indications of rapid non - linear vortex proliferation in @xmath0he - b came from measurements of the critical velocity of vortex formation at temperatures @xmath6 ( ref .  ,",
    "see p. 140141 ) . instead of the usual single - vortex formation at a reproducible critical velocity , sudden avalanches of vortices were observed in accelerating rotation .",
    "these bursts were interpreted to mean that at lower temperatures mutual - friction damping had decreased sufficiently so that turbulence became possible .",
    "the first evidence for tangled vorticity was reported from vibrating wire measurements in a non - rotating cryostat at temperatures below @xmath7.@xcite a vortex network was found to be produced with a vibrating wire resonator when it was driven at high level above a critical velocity of vortex formation .",
    "this was inferred by studying the damping of a second wire , vibrating at low level and probing the density of quasiparticle excitations which are andreev retro - reflected by the superflow fields in the vortex tangle .",
    "similar later measurements have allowed a determination of the vortex density in the wire - generated network . at zero externally applied pressure and at a temperature of @xmath8 the tangle localized around the vibrating wire turned out to have extremely low density , corresponding to an average inter - vortex distance of 0.2 mm , and to decay away rapidly in about 5s , when the generator wire was switched off.@xcite    there exist no immediately obvious techniques by which turbulence can be easily generated and detected in @xmath0he - b .",
    "the above two examples suggest two ways which are supplementary , since they work in different temperature regimes . as outlined below in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] , nmr on a rotating sample can be used at temperatures down to about @xmath9 . in the zero temperature limit , where the density @xmath10 of the normal component approaches zero ,",
    "moving objects can be used to generate vortices and , when driven in a high - quality resonance mode , to detect them . in this report",
    "we outline the techniques by which turbulence is generated and detected in the intermediate temperature regime 0.4  @xmath11 , where mutual friction damping and @xmath10 are still finite . recently",
    "a practical technique was discovered for injecting vortex loops into vortex - free flow.@xcite it then became possible to monitor the nature of vortex dynamics as a function of temperature and flow velocity in a controlled fashion.@xcite the transition , which separates regular vortex motion from turbulence , could now be mapped .",
    "the foundation , on which the interpretation of these results is built , was laid down by an earlier set of important hydrodynamic measurements@xcite on mutual friction which provided both the dissipative and reactive mutual friction coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of temperature @xmath14 and pressure @xmath15 .",
    "it turns out that in @xmath0he - b the variation of mutual friction with temperature happens to be such that the transition falls in the middle of the experimental temperature range , to 0.5  @xmath11 .",
    "these techniques have been employed in three recent studies investigating turbulence in @xmath0he - b.@xcite the first@xcite reports on the flight time of the vorticity when it expands along the rotating column .",
    "the second@xcite describes how turbulence starts in rotating vortex - free flow in the presence of neutron radiation .",
    "the third@xcite discusses the mutual - friction dependence of the transition from regular to turbulent vortex dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ the transition line as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 at high flow velocities , where the transition is velocity independent .",
    "these transition properties will also be illuminated in sec .",
    "[ turbtransition ] of this report , but from a different point of view .",
    "nmr measurements from the transient period , when the turbulent vorticity decays into the equilibrium rotating state of rectilinear vortex lines , will be analyzed in a forthcoming report.@xcite    according to current view no similar kind of turbulence as in @xmath1he - ii or @xmath0he - b exists in the anisotropic superfluid @xmath0he - a . here",

    "let us consider a hydrodynamic equation which describes the evolution of quantized vorticity in a limit , which becomes useful in the interpretation of our measurements .",
    "we apply dimensional analysis to this equation in the same manner as one characterizes different flow regimes with the navier - stokes equation in viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "this immediately leads to the notion that a change in the nature of vortex motion is expected as a function of mutual friction damping .",
    "the argument is simple - minded , but makes the suppression of turbulence by mutual friction damping understandable in superfluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the equation of motion for a viscous incompressible fluid is the navier - stokes equation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an external force per unit volume , @xmath17 pressure , and @xmath28 kinematic viscosity . in order to compare flows with different viscosities",
    "it is useful to write the navier - stokes equation in dimensionless units @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the characteristic length and velocity scales .",
    "the relative importance of the inertial term @xmath34 and the viscous term @xmath35 is used to characterize the flow .",
    "the ratio of these two terms is called the reynolds number @xmath36 . for flows with small @xmath37",
    "the dissipative forces are dominant and the resulting flow is typically laminar .",
    "if @xmath37 is large , the inertial forces are dominant and the flow is usually turbulent .",
    "the same type of classification in superfluid hydrodynamics can be based on an equation for the `` coarse - grained '' superfluid velocity @xmath38 .",
    "it is obtained by averaging over volumes containing many vortex lines .",
    "the equation@xcite is constructed from the euler equation : @xmath39 which can also be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 plays the role of the chemical potential and @xmath42 is the vorticity .    for such coarse - graining to be meaningful the volume , over which we average , should contain many roughly similarly oriented vortex lines .",
    "as each vortex carries a fixed quantized circulation @xmath43 the number of vortex lines in the sample can be estimated from below as @xmath44   l^2 \\sim v l / \\kappa$ ] .",
    "we call this combination the `` superfluid reynolds number '' @xmath45 and require that @xmath46 for the coarse - grained equation to be applicable .",
    "the euler equation basically expresses the conservation of energy and eq .",
    "thus accounts for the kinetic energy of the global flow .",
    "the vortex line tension , which is associated with the @xmath47 local velocity profile around the vortex cores , is neglected .",
    "the tension can be included by introducing a correction@xcite to the superfluid velocity @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is roughly the intervortex spacing , @xmath50 is the vortex core size , and @xmath51 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath52 .",

    "similar to the role of the reynolds number in classical hydrodynamics we might expect that when @xmath78 is large the flow is turbulent and when @xmath78 is small the flow is laminar.@xcite unlike in the classical case , here only the intrinsic properties of the fluid , @xmath12 and @xmath57 , determine the nature of the flow , since @xmath78 does not depend on the externally imposed geometry or the velocity of the flow .",

    "one major difference is that vortex formation can be experimentally controlled in @xmath0he - b to much better degree .",
    "if remanent vortices and other extrinsic sources of vortex formation can be eliminated , then a high energy barrier prevents vortex formation via intrinsic mechanisms up to relatively high counterflow velocities , typically of order 1cm / s .",
    "technically the simplest means of generating high vortex - free flow velocities is to rotate the sample container .",
    "vortex loops can then be injected in the vortex - free flow by means of a few different techniques and their dynamic evolution can be monitored with nmr .",
    "[ rotsupfluidstates ] classifies schematically the different rotating states , from the initial vortex - free state to the equilibrium vortex state .",
    "the most versatile injection method at present time is the kelvin - helmholtz instability of the ab phase boundary.@xcite here the injection can be performed at variable values of rotation @xmath79 and temperature @xmath16 .",

    "surprisingly it turns out that the transition to turbulence is so sharp that the final state contains either a few rectilinear vortex lines ( fig .",

    "[ rotsupfluidstates ] middle ) . as seen from the nmr absorption spectra in fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] on the right , the line shapes of these two final states differ so profoundly that the classification in regular and turbulent events can be performed by inspection only .",
    "this is the case if the rotation velocity @xmath80rad / s and the so - called `` counterflow absorption peak '' ( cf peak ) , generated by the vortex - free flow , is well developed .    in this report",
    "we use the kh instability as injection method .",
    "it is triggered with a small step increase in rotation @xmath81 which is typically a few percent of the total rotation .",
    "this means that in our measurement the externally controlled conditions are maintained constant , since practically even the rotation velocity can be regarded as constant throughout the measurement .",
    "this amounts to an important simplification of the analysis .",
    "the time - dependent evolution of the injected vorticity lasts from tens of seconds to minutes , depending on temperature and rotation velocity . during this transient period nmr signals can be measured which yield information on the dynamics .",

    "the two absorption spectra in fig .  [ expsetup ]",
    "display the extremes of different possible line shapes .",
    "in fact , to monitor the transition to turbulence , they turn out to be the only two line shapes needed .",
    "the large peak in the vortex - free state is produced by the orienting effect of the counterflow on the order parameter texture and is called the _ counterflow peak_. its shift from the larmor field ( at 21.02mt ) is used for temperature measurement and its height is a sensitive function of the number of vortex lines .    when a cluster of rectilinear vortex lines is formed , the cf peak height is reduced .",
    "the reduction is linear with vortex number @xmath92 in the limit @xmath93 , if all other variables remain constant . at large values of @xmath92",
    "the reduction becomes nonlinear and finally , if @xmath92 is continuously increased until it reaches the maximum possible value @xmath94 , the spectrum looks entirely different : here much of the absorption is shifted to high fields and borders prominently to the larmor edge at 21.0mt . with increasing @xmath92 the intensity in the cf peak",
    "is thus shifted closer to the larmor edge .",
    "therefore one may monitor the increase in @xmath92 by recording either the cf peak height or the absorption at the larmor edge . in the latter region",
    "the absorption is less affected by temperature changes and often it is more practical to monitor the evolution of the vortex expansion process at fixed polarization field value close to the larmor edge .",

    "the number of vortex loops injected in the b phase equals the number of new rectilinear vortex lines which are added to the b phase sections per instability event .",
    "the measurement monitors the increase in rectilinear vortex lines per event .",
    "the increase is proportional to the height of the discontinuous steps in the linear staircase patterns and , as seen from the step heights , varies randomly per event .",

    "the first critical event we denote with @xmath98 . during further increase of the rotation drive",
    "the instability occurs recurrently every time when the counterflow at the outer sample perimeter reaches the critical value @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the radial value at which the injected vorticity breaks through the ab interface ( sec .  [ injection ] ) .",
    "simultaneously a central cluster of rectilinear vortex lines starts to develop ( fig .",
    "[ rotsupfluidstates ] right ) .",
    "the parameters controlling the instability are roughly identical in the upper and lower halves of the container . the first instability event ( with vortex - free flow in the two b - phase sections )",

    "[ kh - steps ] . nevertheless , the instabilities of the two ab interfaces in fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] are not coupled , but occur independently .",
    "thus the subsequent instabilities in fig .",
    "[ kh - steps ] are not synchronous , since the number of vortices injected in the b - phase sections at each event varies randomly .",
    "also in the temperature regime where the transition from regular to turbulent vortex expansion takes place , it is quite possible to have a regular event in one half and a turbulent event in the second half .",
    "as the two @xmath0he - b samples are independent , one can have , for instance , vortex - free flow in the upper b - phase section @xmath101 and roughly the equilibrium number of vortices in both the a - phase and the lower b - phase sections @xmath102 .",
    "as @xmath98 is almost equal for both halves of the container , the first critical event can be triggered with a small step increase in @xmath79 at both ab interfaces simultaneously .",
    "this triggers the injection of vortex loops into both @xmath0he - b samples and their dynamic evolution towards the respective final states is then recorded independently .",
    "this is our normal measuring procedure when searching for the transition between regular and turbulent vortex expansion .",

    "four different quartz tubes were examined in this setup .",
    "their properties turned out to vary substantially with respect to vortex formation in the absence of the barrier field and the ab interfaces .",
    "this means that at present the cleanliness and the properties of the fused quartz surfaces are not in reliable control .",

    "it turns out that precise measurements of @xmath92 are not needed .",
    "because of the narrow width of the transition regime between regular and turbulent vortex dynamics at high rotation velocities , we need to distinguish only between two states , one with a small vortex cluster @xmath103 at temperatures above the transition and one with the equilibrium vortex state @xmath104 at temperatures below the transition . in fig .",

    ", at low temperatures below @xmath228 a new interfering feature appears , the continuous proliferation of vorticity when curved vortex lines are present and undergo the kelvin - wave instability.@xcite it then becomes difficult to achieve vortex - free rotation to sufficiently high velocities , as required for the kh instability .",
    "this difficulty grows in prominence at low pressures , especially at zero pressure .",
    "the kelvin - wave instability starts to fill the sample at a seemingly constant rate with rectilinear vortex lines already at low rotation and proceeds until close to the equilibrium vortex state .",
    "the source of the problem are existing curved vortex lines , which at @xmath229 are remanent filaments , left over from earlier rotations .",
    "these are difficult to avoid at low temperatures , since the last one or two remanent vortices take exceedingly long times to annihilate in our long sample tube in standstill @xmath230 .",
    "rotation in the reverse direction is not helpful since the required velocities are of order @xmath231rad / s and even then more often than not lead to a reorientation of the filament ( a reversal in the orientation of @xmath59 ) and thereby via the kelvin - wave instability to more vorticity .",

    "[ introduction ]",
    "we have described the techniques for investigating turbulence in @xmath0he - b in the temperature range @xmath232 .",
    "both the methods to generate turbulence and to record it non - invasively are different from what can be done in @xmath1he - ii . in the temperature region of these measurements the vortex mutual friction of @xmath0he - b changes rapidly and proves to control the character of the vortex dynamics . a sharp transition from regular vortex number conserving dynamics at high temperatures to turbulent dynamics at low temperatures",
    "is observed at @xmath233 .",
    "the best injection mechanism of vortex loops into vortex - free counterflow of @xmath0he - b has been found to be the kelvin - helmholtz instability of the magnetically stabilized interface between @xmath0he - a and @xmath0he - b . in this process",
    "only the number of injected vortex loops is not in good control , which is believed to cause the observed finite transition width .",
    "it is to be expected that further work on turbulence in @xmath0he - b will allow to place turbulence in @xmath1he - ii , the only previously known example of superfluid turbulence , into a wider context .",
    "in contrast to @xmath1he - ii , where in most cases at higher flow velocities one has to deal with the mutual - friction coupled turbulence in both the superfluid and normal components , in @xmath0he - b experiments the normal component is practically always immobile .",
    "thus a simpler example of superfluid turbulence is available for studies here . the present nmr technique , which relies on the influence of the vortex - free counterflow on the order parameter texture , stops working below @xmath234 .",
    "at present it is not known if other nmr techniques can be developed to investigate turbulence in the zero temperature limit .",
    "we thank carlo barenghi , rob blaauwgeers , girgl eska , demosthenes kivotides , nikolai kopnin , makoto tsubota , and grigory volovik for valuable discussions and especially ladislav skrbek and joe vinen for a critical reading of this manuscript .",
