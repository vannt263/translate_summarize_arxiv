    "a wide variety of complex real - world systems can be understood by analyzing the interactions among various entities or components of the system .",
    "this has made network analysis a subject of both theoretical and practical interest .",
    "a plethora of challenging problems related to social , biological , communication networks have intrigued researchers over the past decades , and has led to the development of some sophisticated techniques for network analysis .",
    "this is clearly witnessed in the problems related to network or graph partitioning , where the task is to find strongly connected groups of nodes with sparse connections across groups .",
    "the problem appears in several engineering applications such as circuit or program segmentation  @xcite , community detection in social or biological networks  @xcite , data analysis and clustering  @xcite among others .      the problem of finding a balanced partition of a graph is known to be computationally hard .",
    "however , a number of approximate methods have been studied in the literature .",
    "these include spectral algorithms  @xcite , modularity and likelihood based methods  @xcite , convex optimization  @xcite , belief propagation  @xcite among others .",
    "the empirical success of such methods is not a mere coincidence , and theoretical guarantees for most of these methods have been extensively studied . in this respect , it is quite common to study partitioning algorithms under statistical models for random networks , such as the stochastic block model or planted partition model  @xcite or its variants . in this model ,",
    "one considers a random graph on @xmath0 nodes with a well defined @xmath1-way partition @xmath2 .",
    "the edges are randomly added with probabilities depending on the class labels of the participating nodes .",
    "thus , the following interesting question arises : 0.5ex _ question : _ let @xmath3 be the partition obtained from an algorithm , then what is the number of mismatches between @xmath4 and @xmath3 ? 0.5ex one typically asks for a high probability bound on the above error in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "such error bounds have been established for a variety of partitioning algorithms including aforementioned approaches .",
    "@xcite compare the theoretical guarantees for different approaches .",
    "in the case of random graphs under stochastic block model , analysis of a spectral algorithm was first considered by  @xcite .",
    "however , the popular variant of spectral graph partitioning , commonly known as _ spectral clustering _ , was studied only in recent times  @xcite .",
    "it is now known that for a planted graph with @xmath5 minimum node degree , spectral clustering achieves an @xmath6 error rate .",
    "one commonly refers to this property as the _ weak consistency _ of spectral clustering .",
    "this not the best known error rate as exact recovery of the partitions are known to be possible using other approaches  @xcite .",
    "recent results  @xcite show that an additional refinement process can improve the partitioning of spectral clustering to exactly recover the partitions , thereby achieving _",
    "strong consistency_. the condition on minimum node degree can be also relaxed by considering alternative spectral techniques  @xcite , and these algorithms can detect partitions in sparse random graphs that are close to the algorithmic barrier for community detection  @xcite .      in spite of the vast applicability of network modeling and analysis , there exists more complex scenarios , where pairwise interactions can not accurately model the system of interest .",
    "a common example is folksonomy , where individuals annotate online resources , such as images or research papers .",
    "such problems appear to have a tri - partite structure in form of `` user  resource  annotation '' , and is naturally represented as a 3-uniform hypergraph @xcite , where each edge connects three nodes .",
    "earlier works in data mining  @xcite as well as in computer vision  @xcite have also demonstrated the necessity of uniform hypergraphs .",
    "moreover , in large scale circuit design  @xcite and molecular interaction networks  @xcite , one needs to consider group interactions that is appropriately modeled by a non - uniform hypergraph .",
    "the current work focuses on hypergraph partitioning that appears in various applications such as circuit partitioning  @xcite , categorical data clustering  @xcite , geometric grouping  @xcite and others .",
    "various partitioning techniques are used in practice including move - based algorithms  @xcite , spectral algorithms @xcite , tensor based methods  @xcite etc .",
    "hypergraph partitioning and related problems have been of theoretical interest for quite some time  @xcite .",
    "while early works on hypergraph partitioning studied various properties of hypergraph cuts  @xcite , more recent results provide insights into the algebraic connectivity and chromatic numbers of hypergraphs  @xcite .",
    "however , till date , little is known about the theoretical guarantees of hypergraph partitioning methods that are popular amongst practitioners .",
    "the primary reason for this lack of results , at least in a stochastic framework , is due to the absence of random models of non - uniform hypergraphs that can incorporate a planted structure . planted structures in uniform hypergraphs have been studied in context of hypergraph coloring  @xcite , and in a more general setting in  @xcite , where almost sure error bounds are derived for partitioning planted uniform hypergraphs via tensor decomposition .",
    "but , extension of such models or analysis to non - uniform hypergraphs does not follow directly .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is to derive an error bound for a hypergraph partitioning algorithm that solves a spectral relaxation of the normalized hypergraph cut problem .",
    "this is achieved in the form of a two - fold contribution .",
    "we present a model for generating random hypergraphs with a planted solution .",
    "extensions of the erds - rnyi model to non - uniform hypergraphs have been studied in the literature  @xcite , where , for each @xmath7 , the probability of generating edges of size @xmath7 is controlled by a parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the recent work of  @xcite present a similar model , but with a specified degree sequence .",
    "such models implicitly suggest that one can consider a non - uniform hypergraph as a collection of @xmath7-uniform hypergraphs for varying @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is possible to construct planted models for non - uniform hypergraphs from a collection of uniform hypergraph models .",
    "based on this idea , we present a planted hypergraph model that naturally extends the sparse stochastic block model for graphs  @xcite , and also encompasses previously studied models for uniform hypergraphs  @xcite .",
    "we consider a popular spectral algorithm for hypergraph partitioning , and derive a bound on the number of nodes incorrectly assigned by the algorithm under the above model .",
    "we prove that for random planted hypergraphs with minimum node degree above a certain threshold , the algorithm is weakly consistent in general .",
    "however , the algorithm can also exactly recover the partitions from dense hypergraphs without any subsequent refinement procedure .",
    "our analysis relies on an alternative characterization of the incidence matrix of the random hypergraph , and the use of matrix concentration inequalities  @xcite .",
    "typically , spectral partitioning algorithms involve a post - processing stage of distance based clustering .",
    "though the @xmath1-means algorithm  @xcite or its approximate variants  @xcite are the popular choice in practice , such algorithms are not always guaranteed to provide good clustering .",
    "@xcite discusses the implication of this drawback on the consistency results for spectral clustering  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we establish that under certain conditions , the approximate @xmath1-means algorithm of  @xcite indeed provides a good clustering with very high probability .",
    "finally , we consider special cases of the planted model .",
    "we comment on the allowable model parameters , and illustrate their effect on the derived error bound .",
    "numerical studies reveal the practical significance of spectral hypergraph partitioning as well as the applicability of our analysis .",
    "we first describe the spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithm under consideration in section  [ sec_algorithm ] .",
    "section  [ sec_model ] describes the model for random hypergraphs with a planted partition .",
    "we provide the main consistency result in section  [ sec_main_result ] , followed by a series of examples of planted models studied in section  [ sec_specialcases ] .",
    "section  [ sec_expt ] contains experimental results that validate our model and analysis , and section  [ sec_conclusion ] presents the concluding remarks .",
    "the proofs of the technical lemmas can be found in the appendices .      some of the notations that is often used in this paper are mentioned here .",

    "@xmath16 denotes the euclidean norm for vectors and the spectral norm for matrices , while @xmath17 denotes the frobenius norm .",
    "we sometimes compute standard matrix functions like trace@xmath18 and det@xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we also use asymptotic notations @xmath19 etc . , where we view these quantitites as functions of the number of nodes @xmath0 .",
    "a hypergraph is defined as a tuple @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a set of objects and @xmath22 is a collection of subsets of @xmath21 . though early works in combinatorics viewed this structure purely as a set system",
    ", it was soon realized that one may view @xmath21 as a set of nodes and every element of @xmath22 as an edge ( or connection ) among a subset of nodes .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , such a generalization of graphs helps to simplify several combinatorial results in the graph literature .",
    "a hypergraph is said to be @xmath23-uniform if every edge @xmath24 contains exactly @xmath23 nodes . in this paper , we assume that there are no edges of size 0 or 1 as they do not convey any information in a partitioning framework .",
    "we also assume that the hypergraph is undirected , _",
    "i.e._,there is no ordering of nodes in any edge . under this setting ,",
    "the most simple representation of a hypergraph is in terms of its incidence matrix @xmath25 , where @xmath26 if the node @xmath27 is contained in the edge @xmath28 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "one can note that the degree of any node @xmath27 can be written as @xmath29 , which is simply the sum of the @xmath30 row of @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , the cardinality of any edge @xmath28 is @xmath32 .",
    "several notions of hypergraph cut and hypergraph laplacian have been proposed in the literature  @xcite that generalize the standard notions well studied in the graph literature . in this work ,",
    "we consider the generalization studied in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 , then @xmath34 is called the volume of @xmath35 , while the boundary of @xmath35 , defined as @xmath36 , denotes the set of edges that are cut when the nodes are divided into @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "the volume of @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 we consider the problem of partitioning the vertex set @xmath21 into @xmath1 disjoint sets , @xmath40 , that minimizes the normalized hypergraph cut @xmath41 one can observe that for graphs , the above definition   retrieves the standard notion of a normalized cut  @xcite .",
    "@xcite also define the notion of a normalized hypergraph laplacian matrix @xmath42 given by @xmath43 where the matrices @xmath44 are diagonal with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the problem of minimizing the quantity in   is equivalent to the problem : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is such that @xmath49 , and satisfies @xmath50 .",
    "since the optimization in   is np - hard , one relaxes the problem by minimizing over all @xmath51 with orthonormal columns .",
    "it is well known that the solution to this relaxed problem is the matrix of @xmath1 leading orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is a positive semi - definite matrix with at least one eigenvalue equal to zero .",
    "the term `` leading eigenvectors '' refers to the eigenvectors that correspond to the @xmath1 smallest eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "the above discussion motivates a spectral @xmath1-way partitioning approach based on minimizing nh - cut .",
    "the method is listed in algorithm  [ alg_shp ] .",
    "the form of laplacian matrix in   also suggests that the problem of minimizing nh - cut may be alternatively expressed as the problem of partitioning a graph with weighted adjacency matrix @xmath53 such a graph is related to the star expansion of the hypergraph  @xcite .",
    "the intuition behind the @xmath1-means step in algorithm  [ alg_shp ] is as follows . if the solution of the spectral relaxation results in @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is defined as in  , then after row normalization , @xmath56 corresponds to a binary matrix with exactly one non - zero term in each row .",
    "hence , one obtains the partitions desired in   by performing @xmath1-means on the rows of @xmath56 . in this paper",

    "the consistency result studied in this paper is quite similar , in spirit , to those studied in the case of stochastic block model for graphs .",
    "in such a case , one typically analyzes the population version of a spectral algorithm , and then uses the fact that the spectral properties of the laplacian eventually concentrates around those of the population laplacian . from this point of view , we consider the population version of the hypergraph laplacian   defined as @xmath125}{|\\xi_j| } { \\mathcal{d}}^{-1/2}a_{\\xi_j } a_{\\xi_j}^t{\\mathcal{d}}^{-1/2}\\ ; ,   \\label{eq_hyperlap_population}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the expected degree matrix , _",

    "a more critical condition is the identifiability of the partitions .",
    "note that the definition of the hypergraph laplacian essentially implies that the hypergraph is reduced to a graph with self loops .",
    "hence , the performance of algorithm  [ alg_shp ] crucially depends on the identifiability of the partitions from @xmath131 , or rather from this reduced graph with the population adjacency matrix @xmath132 = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\beta_{m } } \\frac{{\\mathsf{e}}[h_j]}{|\\xi_j| } a_{\\xi_j } a_{\\xi_j}^t\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the following result provides a characterization of @xmath131 and @xmath133 , which in turn helps to quantify the condition for identifiability of the partitions from @xmath131 .    [ lem_expected1 ] let @xmath84 denote the assignment matrix corresponding to the partition @xmath4 .",
    "then the population hypergraph laplacian is given by @xmath134 where @xmath133 can be expressed as @xmath135 here , @xmath136 is diagonal with @xmath137 whenever @xmath138 , and @xmath139 .",
