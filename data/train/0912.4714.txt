    "the quasispecies theory of evolutionary dynamics was originally introduced in a now - classic paper by manfred eigen in 1971 @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "eigen developed a system of ordinary differential equations that were meant to describe the evolutionary dynamics of replicating polynucleotide or polypeptide chains .",
    "the goal was to develop a mathematical framework that would be suitable for modeling the evolutionary processes relevant to the origin of life .",
    "much of the subsequent work by eigen on quasispecies theory was done in collaboration with peter schuster , which is why the quasispecies equations are often referred to as the _ eigen - schuster equations _",
    "@xcite .    in brief ,",
    "the quasispecies model considers a population of genomes , defined as single - stranded sequences , taken to be of length @xmath0 .",
    "a given sequence , denoted @xmath1 , may be expressed as @xmath2 , where each @xmath3 represents a  letter \" or  base \" that is chosen from an alphabet of size @xmath4 ( for all known terrestrial life , @xmath5 , though many phenomenological studies work with @xmath6 for simplicity ) @xcite .    with each @xmath1",
    "is associated a first - order growth rate constant , denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the mapping @xmath8 defines what is known as the _ fitness landscape_. during replication , it is assumed that a daughter strand is produced from the template parent strand .",
    "replication is not necessarily error - free , which gives rise to a transition probability @xmath9 , denoting the probability that parent strand @xmath1 produces the daughter @xmath10 .",
    "the quasispecies equations may then be expressed as @xcite , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 denotes the fraction of organisms in the population that have genome @xmath1 , and @xmath13 is the _ mean fitness _ of the population .",
    "the central result of quasispecies theory is a phenomenon known as the _ error catastrophe_. the error catastrophe refers to a localization to de - localization transition over the genome sequence space once mutation rates have crossed a critical threshold , naturally termed the _ error threshold_. below the error threshold , natural selection is sufficiently strong to localize the population distribution to a  cloud \" of related strains , termed a quasispecies . above the error threshold ,",
    "natural selection is no longer able to counteract mutation - accumulation , and the result is evolutionary dynamics governed by essentially random genetic drift . over time , the population distribution completely de - localizes over the sequence space , and no identifiable quasispecies emerges .",
    "although the origin - of - life problem was the original motivation for the development of quasispecies theory , the quasispecies concept has found broad application in the field of virus evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the reason for this is that many rna viruses , such as hiv , have sufficiently high mutation rates that they exhibit a fairly broad distribution of genotypes , so that the quasispecies concept is highly relevant for these systems .",
    "however , because the quasispecies equations may be readily adapted toward modeling evolution in more complex systems , in recent years there have been efforts to develop quasispecies theory into a useful framework for modeling the evolution of cell - based life .",
    "understanding evolution at the cellular level will have applications in areas such as antibiotic drug resistance in bacteria , immune system function , stem cells , and the somatic evolution of cancer .",
    "some of the work that has been done in quasispecies theory to make it suitable for modeling biological systems more complex than molecules and viruses includes the following : ( 1 ) developing a formulation of the quasispecies model that is appropriate for double - stranded , semiconservatively replicating dna genomes @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) analysis of quasispecies dynamics for multi - gene genomes , which , among other results , revealed that the error catastrophe is a special case of a more general phenomenon that was termed an  error cascade \" @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) using quasispecies theory to model evolution in dynamic environments , and to study the co - evolutionary dynamics that arises from the immune response to a viral infection @xcite . ( 4 ) modeling mutation - propagation in stem and tissue cells @xcite . ( 5 ) modeling genetic repair and repair - deficient strains known as mutators @xcite . ( 6 ) incorporating horizontal gene transfer and recombination into quasispecies theory @xcite .",
    "additionally , other recent work on quasispecies theory has included developing quasispecies equations appropriate for describing polysomic genomes @xcite .",
    "given that cellular genomes are generally composed of several chromosomes , such a formulation of the quasispecies model is a necessary extension for developing realistic models of the evolutionary dynamics of cellular populations .",
    "however , the work on polysomic genomes only considered haploid genomes . here",
    ", in this work , we generalize the quasispecies equations for polysomic genomes to allow for polyploid genomes .",
    "we do not use our equations to model a specific biological system in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain analytical results for the polysomic analogue of the single - fitness - peak landscape , which is the simplest and most commonly studied fitness landscape in quasispecies theory .",
    "these analytical results are in agreement with results obtained from stochastic simulations , suggesting that the equations developed here may be suitable for modeling evolutionary processes in real systems .",
    "we consider a population of asexually replicating organisms , each of which is characterized by a genome consisting of @xmath14 chromosomes . unlike our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we do not assume that the chromosomes are necessarily distinguishable , so that we do not impose any kind of chromosome ordering .",
    "thus , a given genome , denoted @xmath15 , may be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the pair of dna strands of the @xmath18 chromosome .",
    "we also assume that the organisms replicate at a rate characterized by a genome - dependent first - order growth rate constant @xmath19 .    furthermore , we let @xmath20 denote the probability that strand @xmath21 , as part of genome @xmath22 , becomes , after daughter strand synthesis and post - replication lesion repair , chromosome @xmath23 .",

    "given a population of replicating organisms , we let @xmath26 denote the fraction of the population characterized by the genome @xmath15 .",
    "our goal is to develop an expression for @xmath27 .",
    "to do so , we note that the expression for @xmath27 consists of three separate terms : ( 1 ) a destruction term , corrresponding to the effective destruction of the parent genome as a result of semiconservative replication @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) a mean - fitness normalization term , that arises when converting the dynamical equations expressed in terms of population numbers into dynamical equations expressed in terms of population fractions .",

    "it is a chromosome segregation mechanism that was hypothesized to be at work in adult stem cells @xcite , as a way to reduce the accumulation of mutations in stem cells .",
    "immortal dna strand co - segregation has been experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is evidence to suggest that even unicellular organisms , such as _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ , may exhibit immortal dna strand co - segregation @xcite . as a result",
    ", we will develop the quasispecies equations for immortal strand segregation as well .    to derive the equations for immortal dna strand co - segregation , we first note that a given dna strand in a genome is either newly synthesized , or it has gone through a previous replication cycle where it was a template strand . once a dna strand is a template strand , then it remains a template strand throughout all successive replications . given a strand @xmath1 , we let @xmath50 denote a strand that is `` new , '' that is , it has never been a template strand , and we let @xmath51 denote a strand that has been a template strand at least once .",
    "since a chromosome that was produced in a replication cycle must consist of exactly one template and one new strand , a given chromosome is either of the form @xmath52 , or @xmath53 .",
    "we also note that a given genome consists entirely of chromosomes containing only new strands , or entirely of chromosomes containing one template and one new strand . for if one chromosome contains a template strand , then that strand must have come from a parent cell in a previous replication cycle .",
    "this parent cell must have had @xmath54 other parent strands coming from @xmath54 other chromosomes that segregated into the daughter cell .",
    "therefore , the other chromosomes of the genome must contain a template strand as well .    given a genome @xmath15 ,",
    "we let @xmath55 signify that the genome consists entirely of new strands , and we let @xmath56 signify that the genome consists of chromosomes containing exactly one template and one new strand .",

    "we then have , from appendix a , @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      it is interesting to note that even when we do not assume that the genomes are necessarily haploid , it still follows that it is possible to derive an ordered strand - pair formulation of the dynamics that is identical to the haploid case @xcite .",
    "we should therefore note that in the case of haploid genomes , we made an additional assumption regarding the fitness and error landscapes that allows for a convenient representation of the dynamics .",
    "we make the identical assumption in this paper , and obtain a similarly convenient representation of the dynamics for the general case .",
    "following @xcite , we begin by defining two operations @xmath63 and @xmath64 , acting on ordered strand - pairs , as follows : @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the strand complementary to @xmath1 ( because dna is antiparallel , then if @xmath68 , and if @xmath69 denotes the base complementary to @xmath70 , we then have @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , given some vector of ordered strand - pairs @xmath72 , and a vector @xmath73 , with each @xmath74 , we make the following definitions : @xmath75    now , note that the fitness landscape is symmetric under @xmath63 , that is @xmath76 for all @xmath77 .",
    "we also assume that the fitness landscape satisfies a _ complementarity symmetry _ , that is , @xmath78 for all @xmath77 .",
    "the idea behind this assumption is that because taking the complement of a strand essentially amounts to a relabelling of the bases and a change in the order in which those bases are read , without any kind of specific sequence information there is no reason _ a priori _ to assume that a complementarity symmetry does not hold .",
    "note that for a strand pair of the form @xmath79 , we have that @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , for genomes consisting of entirely of chromosomes comprised of perfectly complementary strands , we have that @xmath81 , and so the complementarity symmetry automatically holds .",
    "we further assume that the transition probability @xmath82 obeys a complementarity symmetry , that is , @xmath83 .",
    "such a condition can be accomplished if we assume that mutations are due to a base - independent mismatch probability @xmath84 , which obeys the complementarity symmetry .",
    "it may be shown that a population distribution that initially obeys the complementarity symmetry will obey this symmetry for all time , assuming that the fitness landscapes and transition probabilities obey this symmetry . because this derivation was already done in @xcite , we will not repeat it here . furthermore ,",
    "if the population distribution , along with the fitness landscape and transition probabilities , all obey a complementarity symmetry , then we may express the quasispecies equations in a more convenient form .",
    "again , the derivation has been previously worked out in @xcite , so we simply present the final results here . for random segregation ,",

    ", we will consider fitness landscapes that have certain properties that will allow for a considerably simplified version of the equations .",
    "the assumption of infinite sequence length is a common one in quasispecies theory @xcite , and is simply a mathematical formalization of the assumption of very long genome lengths .      to begin",
    ", we assume that there exists a  master \" genome , @xmath87 , that has the wild - type fitness @xmath88 .",
    "this master genome consists of @xmath89 distinct strand - pairs , denoted @xmath90 , where the master genome consists of @xmath37 pairs of the @xmath91 strand - pair , so that @xmath92 .",
    "we define the _",
    "@xmath91 homologous group _ of the master genome to be precisely the @xmath37 copies of the @xmath91 strand - pair , @xmath93 .",
    "we also let @xmath94 denote the length , or the number of base - pairs , in @xmath93 .",
    "the total length , @xmath0 , of the master genome , is then defined to be @xmath95 .",
    "we then define @xmath96 .",
    "we assume that , during replication , daughter strand synthesis is not error - free , and is characterized by a per - base mismatch probability of @xmath97 .",
    "we then allow the total sequence length , @xmath0 , of the master genome to become infinite , while keeping @xmath98 to be constant .",
    "physically , this corresponds to maintaining a constant replication fidelity in the limit of very large genomes .",
    "this is a common assumption in quasispecies models , and reflects the fact that the average number of mutations per genome per replication cycle , as measured by @xmath99 , is generally far smaller than the size of the genomes themselves @xcite .    in the limit of infinite sequence length",
    ", we may make the following assumptions about the master genome : for any two indices @xmath100 , we have that , @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the _ hamming distance _ between any two sequences ( the hamming distance is the number of positions where the two sequences differ ) .    to understand the basis for these assumptions , we may note that , in the limit of infinite sequence length , a given sequence will , on average , differ from its complement at an infinite number of positions @xcite . also , since we do not assume any kind of correlation between the homologous groups , we assume that the strands from distinct homologous groups also differ from each other at an infinite number of positions .",
    "we now consider an initially clonal population consisting entirely of the master genome that is allowed to reproduce and evolve .",
    "after some time , consider some strand - pair @xmath23 in some genome of some organism .",
    "suppose that this strand pair has the property that , for some @xmath47 , both hamming distances @xmath103 and @xmath104 are finite . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath23 belongs to the _",
    "@xmath91 homologous group_. then it follows that @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 are infinite for @xmath109 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are infinite , and that @xmath112 is infinite . as a result ,",
    "a given strand - pair can only belong to at most one homologous group .    when @xmath23 replicates , both @xmath1 and @xmath10 act as templates for the synthesis of the complementary daughter strand .",
    "because @xmath99 , only a finite number of mismatches will occur in both daughter strand syntheses . as a result ,",
    "if @xmath1 produces @xmath113 , with daughter @xmath114 , then we have that @xmath115 and @xmath116 are both finite .",
    "a similar result holds for the daughter strand - pair produced by @xmath10 .",
    "note then that the daughters of @xmath23 also belong to the @xmath91 homologous group .    consider a genome where , for @xmath117",
    ", there are exactly @xmath37 strand - pairs belonging to the @xmath91 homologous group .",
    "these @xmath37 strand - pairs produce , upon replication , @xmath118 strand - pairs belonging to the @xmath91 homologous group , which then segregate equally into two daughter cells , so that each of the daughter cells have exactly @xmath37 strand - pairs belonging to the @xmath91 homologous group . by induction",
    ", it follows that , if we begin with a clonal population consisting entirely of the master genome , then for all times all genomes in the population will have , for each @xmath117 , exactly @xmath37 strand - pairs belonging to the @xmath91 homologous group .",
    "a given genome is taken to have the wild - type fitness of @xmath47 if each homologous group contains at least one functional , or _ viable _ , chromosome .",
    "otherwise , the fitness is taken to be @xmath119 . to completely characterize the fitness landscape",
    ", we therefore need to properly define what we mean by a `` viable '' chromosome .",
    "so , consider some strand - pair , @xmath23 , that belongs to the @xmath91 homologous group",
    ". then we either have that @xmath103 , @xmath104 are finite , or @xmath111 , @xmath110 are finite .",
    "let us assume that the former case holds , since the two cases are completely equivalent .",
    "then let @xmath120 denote the number of base - pairs where @xmath1 and @xmath10 are complementary , but where @xmath1 and @xmath10 differ from @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath123 denote the number of base - pairs where @xmath1 differs from @xmath121 , but where @xmath10 is identical to @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath124 denote the number of base - pairs where @xmath1 is identical to @xmath121 , but where @xmath10 differs from @xmath122 .",
    "finally , let @xmath125 denote the number of base - pairs where both @xmath1 and @xmath10 are non - complementary , and differ from @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "then the strand - pair @xmath23 is said to be `` viable '' if and only if @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a function of the homologous group number .",
    "the idea here is that if either @xmath120 or @xmath125 are positive , then there are regions of the chromosome where sequence information is lost , rendering the chromosome non - functional .",
    "however , where one strand differs from the master sequence but the other strand does not , sequence information is preserved . if there are not too many such mismatches , or _ lesions _",
    ", then the cellular enzymatic machinery can recover the master sequence information , rendering the chromosome functional .",
    "this fitness landscape is of course a great oversimplification of actual fitness landscapes .",
    "nevertheless , it is a useful first approximation with which we can obtain analytical results from our evolutionary dynamics equations .",
    "the master genome gives rise to @xmath129 ordered strand - pair vectors , given by @xmath130 , where @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "we may use this ordering to group the ordered strand - pair vectors into classes , as follows : first , we pick an ordering for the set of permutations @xmath133 , and list them in some order @xmath134 .",

    "we make the following claim : if we start with a clonal population consisting entirely of the wild - type ( i.e. the master genome ) , then all genomes produced by the evolutionary dynamics of the population give rise to ordered strand - pair vectors belonging to a unique class .",
    "to prove this , we must show that all genomes produced by the evolutionary dynamics give rise to ordered strand - pair vectors belonging to some class , and then we must show that a given ordered strand - pair vector can not belong to more than one class .",
    "we have already shown that all genomes produced by the evolutionary dynamics of the population give rise to genomes which have @xmath37 chromosomes belonging to the @xmath91 homologous group for each @xmath117 .",
    "let us then consider some ordered strand - pair vector @xmath147 generated by some genome in the population . the ordered strand - pair @xmath148 is generated from the strand pair @xmath17 , which in turn belongs to some homologous group as defined above .",
    "we say that @xmath148 belongs to the same homologous group as @xmath17 .",

    "this of course does not mean that an analytical expression does not exist .",
    "it simply means that obtaining an analytical expression for the mean fitness is considerably more difficult for the polyploid case than it is for the haploid case .",

    "this signals the onset of the error catastrophe , whereby natural selection can no longer localize the population about the fast replicating genotypes , and the result is dynamics governed by pure genetic drift .    in the end ,",

    "we begin with random segregation , and our goal is to initially derive equations for the @xmath26 population fractions .",
    "although the chromosomes are formally indistinguishable , for purposes of the derivation we can assign an arbitrary chromosome ordering to every genome .",
    "the only requirement is that once an ordering is chosen , we use that same ordering for the given genome .",
    "similarly , for each chromosome in a given genome with an assigned ordering , we can tag one of the strands with a `` 0 '' , and the other with a `` 1 '' .",
    "again , this tagging scheme is arbitrary ; however , once chosen , must be consistent .",
    "this chromosome ordering and strand tagging scheme allows us to appropriately keep track of the chromosomes during the replication process .    during the replication process",

    "the chromosomes formed from the `` 0 '' strands and the `` 1 '' strands segregate into opposite cells .",
    "since chromosome segregation is random , each chromosome has a @xmath190 probability of segregating into a given daughter cell .",
