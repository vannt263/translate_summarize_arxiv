    "the warped extra dimension provides an alternative framework in which to address the standard model ( sm ) gauge hierarchy problem  @xcite and the fermion mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "it is a particularly attractive scenario because , by the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , the five - dimensional ( 5d ) framework is dual to a four - dimensional ( 4d ) strongly - coupled conformal field theory .",
    "this allows the physics of the warped fifth dimension to be recast in terms of 4d strong dynamics .",
    "in particular , an infrared ( ir ) brane used to generate the higgs cutoff scale is interpreted in the 4d dual as the breaking of conformal symmetry at low energy and the generation of a mass - gap by an operator of infinite scaling dimension . while the essential physics is captured in this theoretically idealized situation",
    ", it is more natural to expect operators of finite dimension in the dual theory .",
    "this can be achieved in soft - wall models in which the  hard - wall \" ir brane is replaced by a scalar field ( the  dilaton \" ) whose nontrivial bulk profile corresponds to conformal symmetry breaking in the dual 4d theory .    the standard model in the soft - wall warped dimension was considered in ref.@xcite . since there is no ir brane , sm fields are necessarily bulk fields , which includes not only the gauge bosons and fermions , but also the higgs field . even though the fifth - dimension is semi - infinite ,",
    "the dilaton does provide a dynamical cutoff to the warped dimension .",
    "this leads to a discrete kaluza - klein ( kk ) mass spectrum , but with the distinctive feature that there is a variety of kk spacing between the resonances , including linear regge - like behavior as in qcd .",
    "a bulk higgs condensate is responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry but causes the analysis of fermions to be particularly involved .",
    "an analytical solution can nevertheless be obtained in the case of a single fermion generation confirming that the nice features of hard - wall scenarios , such as fermion mass hierarchies and universal kk gauge couplings , also exist with the soft wall  @xcite .",
    "however these features have yet to be confirmed in a complete three - generation soft - wall model .    in this paper",
    "we present a more comprehensive analysis of bulk fermions in a soft - wall warped dimension ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "while new analytical solutions are found for special cases in the case of a single generation , the complete three - generation case can only be treated numerically .",
    "this is because the bulk higgs condensate causes large mixing between fermion flavors in the equations of motion which makes finding analytical solutions nontrivial .",
    "nonetheless , numerical techniques can be used and we present a numerical routine that can solve the general problem with arbitrary 5d mass parameters .",
    "importantly we find that starting with  anarchic \" 5d parameters we are able to generate fermion mass hierarchies and universal couplings to kk gauge bosons , analogous to that found in hard - wall models .",
    "this provides a framework to generalize existing phenomenological analyses to include the soft - wall standard model .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ setup ] , we review the setup needed to model fermions in the soft - wall background and present the fermion equations of motion . in section [ spectrum ] , we develop the tools needed to solve the equations of motion in the special cases where the equations can be partially decoupled .",
    "one of these cases has been detailed before in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the remaining cases are new .",
    "we then show that these additional analytical cases can be used to reproduce many of the recent numerical results of @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing flavor changing neutral current processes and by detailing the couplings of fermions to gauge bosons  an analysis which is easily generalized to other bulk couplings . in section [ numerical ] , we present a very simple , non - iterative routine which can be used to analyze multiple generations of fermions in an arbitrary background .",
    "we present the full dependence of sm fermion masses on the 5d bulk mass parameters and compare the results to a typical hard - wall model .",
    "the behavior is shown to be very different in the phenomenologically interesting region of the parameter space , where the bulk @xmath2 doublet and singlet fermions have opposite bulk masses .",
    "we then present results for the case of three fermion generations with substantial mixing between bulk profiles , and find example spectra resembling the up- and down - type quarks ( and charged leptons ) in the spirit of ref.@xcite .",
    "we work in a 5d spacetime @xmath3 with conformal coordinate @xmath4 and metric : @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "in particular we will consider a pure ads metric , i.e. @xmath7 with @xmath8 the ads curvature scale .",
    "the spacetime is defined on the interval @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the location of the ultraviolet ( uv ) brane .",
    "though the spacetime extends to @xmath11 , we have in mind a soft - wall setup in which the dilaton , @xmath12 obtains a background value and provides a dynamical cutoff to spacetime along the fifth coordinate @xmath4 . in this scenario , gauge and matter fields are described by the action , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the 5d lagrangian . while much of our discussion of fermions is valid in general , for the sake of concreteness we will specifically consider a dilaton profile given by : @xmath15 where the soft - wall mass scale @xmath16 .",
    "this form for the dilaton was also studied in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "consider 5d dirac fermions , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) which transform as a doublet ( singlet ) under @xmath2 .",
    "it is straightforward to embed our setup in a theory with a bulk custodial @xmath19 symmetry , but this will not be essential for our discussion . in the absence of yukawa interactions ,",

    "the projections of the dirac spinors are given by @xmath27 and similarly for @xmath28 .",
    "dirichlet conditions are imposed on the fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 at the uv boundary : @xmath31 without bulk yukawa interactions these boundary conditions give rise to massless chiral fermions from the 4d point of view .",
    "these zero - modes can obtain a mass by introducing a yukawa coupling to the higgs , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is @xmath4-dependent .",
    "the yukawa interaction contribution to the action is : @xmath32 , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & -\\int d^5 x \\sqrt{-g } e^{-\\phi } \\ , \\big [ m^{ij}(z)\\,{\\bar\\psi}^i_l(x , z)\\psi^j_r(x , z ) + { \\rm h.c.}\\ , \\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have substituted the background value for the higgs field : @xmath33 and dropped the @xmath25 labels @xmath34 .",
    "the effective @xmath4-dependent bulk mass term arising from the yukawa interaction is simply : @xmath35 to ensure a discrete spectrum of fermion masses , the higgs vev must grow faster than the metric factor , @xmath36 , decays .",
    "namely , , there can exist discrete low - lying modes with a continuous spectrum above a  mass gap \" , as in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] @xmath37 varying the action with respect to @xmath38 , we find the equations of motion : @xmath39 where we have defined @xmath40 .",
    "this transformation shows that the fermion mass spectra do not depend on the presence of the dilaton .",
    "rather , it is the higgs vev that sets the fermion spacing , in contrast to the case of bosonic fields .",
    "the kk expansion for the fields @xmath41 is assumed to be : @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( no sum over @xmath44 ) .",
    "similar to the conventions of ref.@xcite we have introduced separate latin and greek indices labelling the 5d and 4d flavor , respectively . defining the vectors : @xmath45 allows the equations of motion for the 5d fields to be written in the form : @xmath46 f^{j \\alpha ( n)}_{\\pm}(z ) = m^{\\alpha}_n f^{i \\alpha ( n)}_\\mp , \\label{genferm}\\ ] ] where the mixing matrix is defined as @xmath47 note that @xmath48 run from @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number of fermion generations .",
    "thus @xmath51 is a @xmath52 matrix , and eq . represents a coupled system of @xmath53 differential equations for each @xmath44 .",
    "the 4d fermion fields @xmath54 are canonically normalized by requiring that : @xmath55=\\delta^{nm}\\delta^{\\alpha \\beta}. \\label{normf}\\ ] ] note that the index @xmath56 is to be summed over in this expression .",
    "this completes the general discussion of the fermion setup . to obtain the spectrum of fermion masses , the equations of motion",
    "are solved subject to the boundary conditions and orthonormality conditions .",
    "the coupled equations can not be solved analytically except for a few special cases , depending upon the particular form of the higgs vev and the relative bulk masses for the fermions . up to this point ,",
    "the only solvable cases that have been presented in the literature have involved just a single generation with degenerate bulk masses for the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as it turns out , in ads space",
    "there are additional special cases which allow for the second - order equations of motion to be diagonalized and solved exactly .",
    "the collection of solvable cases provides a qualitatively complete picture of fermion behavior in the entire parameter space .",
    "next , we review the single generation case in detail .",
    "we begin very generally , emphasizing that these methods apply to a wide variety of soft - wall models in ads .",
    "we then specialize to a quadratic vev and solve the equations of motion directly for the special cases .",
    "the analytic solutions allow us to verify the results of the numerical routine we present in section [ numerical ] ( as well as a recent numerical treatment in which the yukawas are treated perturbatively  @xcite ) .      for a single generation of fermions , equation becomes : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a @xmath59 mixing matrix : @xmath60 the equations for @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be decoupled by deriving a second - order equation from ( [ singlegenferm ] ) .",

    "however , there are special cases for which the second - order equations can be decoupled further .",
    "they occur whenever : @xmath67 the `` degenerate '' case is separable in any background .",

    "only one of the potentials @xmath73 will be diagonal .",
    "after solving the corresponding pair of decoupled second - order equations , the first - order equations can then be used to generate the remaining solutions .",

    "the effect of this non - constant bulk mass is that normalizable zero - modes persist ( depending on the choice of the signs of @xmath145 ) even in the limit @xmath146 .",
    "for small values of @xmath147 , the spectrum may be found by treating the bulk yukawa interaction as a perturbation on the @xmath148 solutions .",
    "such an approach can be related to ours in some cases .",
    "for example , in the case of degenerate constant mass pieces , @xmath149 , global unitary transformations may still be used to diagonalize the mass matrix when the bulk masses have the same functional form as the higgs vev .",
    "thus , the introduction of non - constant bulk masses can be viewed as effectively changing the boundary conditions on the fields in such cases .",
    "it is interesting to note that the case considered in @xcite is similar to our `` split '' case . in particular , they examine @xmath150 and @xmath151 in detail . in the slightly different split configuration for the constant pieces of the bulk mass , @xmath152 , analytical solutions can be obtained in a similar fashion to our earlier analysis . for @xmath153 , we find the lowest lying kk tower to be : @xmath154 where we have defined effective parameters , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 to make the comparison with ( [ frmb])-([flmb ] ) clear .",

    "we expect that all of the basic features of the non - constant bulk mass model should be contained within our exact solutions .",
    "generically the split and degenerate cases allow one to find the spectrum exactly by solving a set of decoupled second - order equations .",
    "even when the equations can not be solved exactly , approximate methods such as those we have described above may be employed .",
    "additionally , as our numerical results will verify , one can expect the behavior in these special cases to provide a complete qualitative picture of the full parameter space dependence .      of significant interest in models involving extra dimensions",
    "is the coupling of fermions to the kk gauge bosons .",
    "when the fermions are localized at different points along the extra dimension , they can obtain non - universal couplings to the excited gauge bosons .",
    "such non - universality will generically lead to large contributions to flavor physics observables , providing very stringent lower bounds on the allowed kk scale @xcite .    in hard - wall models",
    ", the couplings can become universal for certain regions of the parameter space , resulting in a gim - like suppression of flavor changing neutral currents @xcite , thereby greatly lowering the bound on the allowed kk scale .",
    "we therefore would like to see if a similar effect is present in the soft - wall case .",
    "moreover , we would like to develop our formalism in such a way that multiple fermion generations can be incorporated .",

    "the gauge boson profiles arising from a quadratic dilaton were derived in @xcite .",
    "here we simply use the results .",
    "the zero - mode couplings @xmath162 remain universal due to the orthonormality condition and the flat zero mode gauge boson profile .",
    "this is because the dilaton factor explicitly cancels and plays no role .",
    "the degenerate single - generation case was considered in @xcite , where it was found that only one of the couplings , @xmath163 or @xmath164 , can become universal due to the opposite localizations of the fermion modes . in ref @xcite ,",
    "it was seen that opposite constant and non - constant bulk masses led to universal couplings for both @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this happens as well for the split case solutions .",
    "we have plotted the couplings for this case in figs .",
    "[ gaugeplota ] and [ gaugeplotb ] .",

    "note that the bounds from flavor physics are generically expected to be more stringent in soft - wall models than in models with a hard wall .",
    "this follows from the generically closer spacing of the kk modes in soft - wall models as compared to hard - wall models .",
    "for example , we can consider the contribution to @xmath170 arising from non - universal couplings .",
    "the effective 4d lagrangian contains operators that are suppressed by the squared masses of the kk gauge bosons mediating the strangeness - changing transitions ( @xmath171 ) : @xmath172 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the sum is over the gauge boson kk modes with kk masses @xmath173 , and @xmath174 with @xmath175 generic unitary matrices  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the presence of non - degenerate couplings to the bulk kk gauge bosons , bounds from flavor experiments may be interpreted as a lower bound on the kk scale .",
    "the key point is that the total amount of suppression in depends upon the spacing of the kk tower . in a hard - wall model , for example , @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the kk mass scale",
    "this compares with the soft - wall scenario where it would seem to imply a problem , because the squared mass trajectories grow generically as @xmath178 ( indeed , this spacing was the original motivation for studying the soft - wall @xcite ) . while the sum of @xmath179 diverges as @xmath180 , we should of course truncate the sum at some high energy cutoff .",
    "nevertheless , the naive implication is that the constraints on soft - wall models should be considerably tighter .",
    "however , this argument ignores the fact that the gauge bosons become increasingly ir localized with increasing mode number @xmath181 .",
    "thus , any off - diagonal terms in the gauge coupling matrices are further suppressed for large @xmath181 . by performing a numerical fit using the first several dozen gauge boson modes and our split case solutions , we find that the couplings fall off as @xmath182 to a very good approximation in the region where the couplings are independent of localization .",
    "this implies that the terms in the sum grow as @xmath183 .",
    "all other things being equal , this implies that the constraints from flavor physics are roughly a factor of two more stringent in this model than in hard - wall models .    while this presents no great problem for the model with a _",
    "dilaton , for a generic power law behavior in the dilaton , @xmath184 , the spectrum of gauge bosons grows as @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "this means that for less steep potentials , even tiny amounts of non - degeneracy among the bulk couplings has potentially severe implications for flavor physics .     and  split \" @xmath186 cases , where the solid lines are determined in ref.@xcite ( degenerate ) and from ( split ) .",

    "we generically expect that the entries of each matrix are all of order unity ( in units of the ads curvature scale , @xmath8 ) , and that the various matrices are misaligned .",
    "there is of course some basis in which both @xmath214 and @xmath215 are diagonal .",
    "thus , by `` misaligned , '' we mean that this basis is distinct from the one in which the yukawa matrix is diagonal .",
    "indeed , the typical approach is to work in this basis , treating the yukawa interactions as perturbations .",
    "such an approach has been used in both hard - wall @xcite and even very recently in soft - wall setups @xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was found that one needed to include the first several ( @xmath217 ) kk modes in order to achieve reliable results in such a perturbative expansion when including only a single generation . at such a point ,",
    "the analysis is essentially a numerical exercise . in our view , it is advantageous to include the entire kk tower in the numerical formulation wherever possible . in other words",
    "it may make the most sense to simply solve the equations of motion , which guarantee the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions due to the hermiticity of the mixing matrix .",
    "we expect that all other interactions may be treated reliably as perturbations .",
    "this is because the higgs grows unbounded in the ir where it is the dominant contribution to the fermion equations of motion .",
    "other observables may thus be calculated using the usual wavefunction overlap approximation . as an application",
    ", we will calculate the couplings to excited gauge bosons for examples involving three generations .",
    "we do not attempt to set precise bounds on soft - wall models here , as doing so goes significantly beyond the scope of this work .",
    "electroweak and flavor constraints have been discussed in the context of soft - wall models in refs .",
    "detailed analyses in various hard - wall scenarios can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , we will require that the eigenvalues of the bulk mass matrices satisfy @xmath218 and @xmath219 in order to get nearly degenerate gauge couplings .",
    "because of the lower bound on the fermion masses at @xmath220 in this region , it is clear that the hierarchy considered above , @xmath221 will be inadequate for generating mev scale masses when @xmath222 , and will only be possible for @xmath223 .",
    "thus we again assume a quadratic higgs vev , @xmath224 , and the following for our input parameters : @xmath225 dealing with much larger hierarchies presents significant numerical challenges . however , the qualitative results of such an analysis should not be substantially different from the results presented here .    first , we present an example resembling down - type quarks ( or charged leptons ) . for simplicity , we take the entries of @xmath214 to be nearly degenerate , but we allow for large non - degeneracy in the matrix @xmath215 as well as in the yukawa matrix . specifically , we consider , @xmath226 @xmath227 we find a spectrum of masses resembling the down - type quarks ( or charged leptons ) : @xmath228 the fermion mass hierarchy is clearly obtained , but due to the complexity of the numerical procedure we do not match the sm masses exactly , and postpone a more detailed analysis for future work . the fermion bulk profiles , @xmath229 are plotted in figure  [ mdplot ] .",
    "the fermion profile overlap with the higgs vev , @xmath230 leads to the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "the corresponding bulk profiles , @xmath231 are not plotted because the profile differences between the flavors are not as pronounced .",
    "this is due to our choice of uv boundary conditions and bulk masses ( [ 5ddownvar ] ) .",
    "( in units of @xmath232 ) for the first generation ( solid ) , second generation ( dashed ) and third generation ( dotted ) showing the overlap with the higgs vev @xmath230 ( in units of @xmath233 with @xmath234 ) .",
    "]    from expression , we can calculate the coupling of the zero mode fermions to the kk gauge bosons ( i.e. gluons ) .",
    "the result is a matrix whose off - diagonal entries contribute to flavor violation .",
    "we obtain the following results for the first two kk gauge coupling matrices , normalized to the coupling to the massless gauge boson : @xmath235 this behavior is maintained for higher modes as well . for this choice of parameters ,",
    "the very nearly degenerate couplings imply that @xmath198 of order a few tev will be consistent with flavor constraints @xcite .",
    "note that we have assumed no contributions to cp violation .",
    "thus the soft - wall model can accommodate the fermion mass hierarchy with large bulk mixing and small flavor violation .",
    "( in units of @xmath232 ) for the first generation ( solid ) , second generation ( dashed ) and third generation ( dotted ) showing the overlap with the higgs vev @xmath230 ( in units of @xmath233 with @xmath234 ) .",
    "]    the up - type quarks are only moderately more sensitive to the presence of the top quark when large bulk mixing is allowed . for the choices ( [ newvals ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath236 @xmath237 which gives rise to the following mass spectrum : @xmath238 again we see that the correct fermion mass hierarchy can be obtained . the fermion bulk profiles , @xmath239 are plotted in figure  [ muplot ] . the fermion profile overlap with the higgs vev",
    ", @xmath230 leads to the fermion mass hierarchy . similarly to the down - type fermions , the corresponding up - type bulk profiles @xmath231 are not plotted because the profile differences are negligible due to the choice of uv boundary conditions and bulk masses ( [ 5dupvar ] ) .",
    "the gauge couplings are nearly universal among the first two generations : @xmath240 constraints from top quark physics are significantly weaker , so this is not expected to affect the bound on @xmath198 .",
    "we have presented a variety of tools useful for studying fermion physics in soft - wall backgrounds , focusing heavily on the treatment of fermion masses .",
    "the equations of motion are non - trivial to solve and generically require numerical techniques .",
    "however , we have documented several special cases for which it is possible to decouple the equations of motion .",
    "these cases serve as useful examples for qualitatively understanding the full parameter space behavior , as they illuminate independent `` axes '' of the parameter space along which fermion behavior can be understood in detail .",
    "the utility of our approach is due not only to the fact that it effectively reduces the problem to solving a set of one - dimensional schrdinger - like equations , for which many theoretical and numerical tools have been created , but also to the fact that it applies to _ any _ soft - wall model in ads space .",
    "this opens up the possibility of analyzing fermions in a wide variety of higgs models .",
    "for example , it should be possible to analyze fermion physics in unhiggs scenarios , such as that considered in ref.@xcite , or to study other power - law higgs behavior , as has been examined in the degenerate case in refs.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have outlined methods for calculating fermion masses and wavefunctions in an arbitrary background with multiple flavors and arbitrary bulk parameters .",
    "the formalism maintains the orthogonality of the kk tower , making it particularly useful for studying the experimental consequences of soft - wall models with additional bulk fields .",
    "for example , we showed explicitly how to calculate the fermionic couplings to kk gauge bosons .",
    "the off - diagonal entries in the coupling matrix are directly related to the amplitudes of flavor changing neutral current processes .",
    "moreover , we argued that the experimental constraints on new sources of flavor violation are generically tighter in soft - wall models than in hard - wall models due to the smaller spacing of the kk resonances .",
    "while the tightening is not too constraining in a model with a _",
    "dilaton , for an ir cut - off growing much less quickly than @xmath241 , the constraints can become severe for model building .",
    "we described a very simple numerical technique for calculating fermion spectra , which we used to show the full parameter space dependence of sm fermion masses on the bulk mass parameters .",
    "the technique maintains the attractive features of the formalism , such as an orthogonal kk tower and extends naturally to incorporate several generations of fermions .",
    "thus , the solutions allow for the straightforward calculation and interpretation of new physics observables .",
    "both the analytical and numerical results suggest the potential for rich collider physics that is substantially different from that obtained in hard - wall models . while our results were for a particular choice of a bulk higgs vev , they demonstrate that a soft - wall background can lead to a distinctive phenomenology .",
    "for example , our results indicate the presence of a lower bound on fermion masses in a large area of the parameter space , suggestive of a seesaw - like mechanism .",
    "this could easily be implemented to explain neutrino masses in a scenario where the hierarchy between @xmath8 and @xmath198 is of order the gut scale . by introducing three additional right handed neutrino fields ,",
    "a fairly random difference between the bulk masses of the right - handed neutrinos and charged leptons could naturally lead to light neutrino masses .",
    "this would be an interesting variation on the ideas that are well - known in the hard - wall picture ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    even with these differences ,",
    "the essential and attractive features of the hard - wall can be retained in our model .",
    "we presented results for three generations of fermions with anarchic 5d parameters that reveal standard model - like particle masses and gim - like suppression of kk gauge boson mediated flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "we argued that this implied a fairly modest bound on the kk scale .",
    "a more general analysis of flavor physics bounds will lead to stringent constraints in the soft - wall model .",
    "having developed the tools needed to examine electroweak and flavor physics in full detail , a more detailed study can be now be undertaken .",
