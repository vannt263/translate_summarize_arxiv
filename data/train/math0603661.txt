    "frames are redundant bases which turn out in certain applications to be more flexible than the better known orthonormal bases ( onbs ) in hilbert space .",
    "the frames allow for more symmetries than onbs do , especially in the context of signal analysis , and of wavelet constructions ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since frame bases ( although containing redundancies ) still allow for efficient algorithms , they have found many applications , even in finite dimensions ; see , for example , @xcite .    as is well known , when a vector @xmath1 in a hilbert space @xmath2 is expanded in an orthonormal basis @xmath3",
    ", there is then automatically an associated parseval identity . in physical terms",
    ", this identity typically reflects a _ stability _",
    "feature of a decomposition based on the chosen onb @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , parseval s identity reflects a conserved quantity for a problem at hand , for example , energy conservation in quantum mechanics .",
    "the theory of frames ( see definitions [ defmor.1 ] ) begins with the observation that there are useful vector systems which are in fact not onbs but for which a parseval formula still holds .",
    "in fact , in applications it is important to go beyond onbs . while this viewpoint originated in signal processing ( in connection with frequency bands , aliasing , and filters ) , the subject of frames appears now to be of independent interest in mathematics .    on occasion",
    ", we may have a system of vectors @xmath4 in @xmath2 for which parseval s identity is still satisfied , but such that a generalized parseval s identity might only hold up to a fixed constant @xmath5 of scale .",
    "( for example , in sampling theory , a scale might be introduced as a result of `` oversampling '' . ) in this case , we say that the constant @xmath5 scales the expansion .",
    "suppose a system of vectors @xmath4 in a given hilbert space @xmath2 allows for an expansion , or decomposition of every @xmath1 in @xmath2 , but the analogue of parseval s identity holds only up to a fixed constant @xmath5 of scale .",
    "in that case , we say that @xmath4 is a _ tight frame _ with frame constant @xmath5 .",
    "so the special case @xmath6 is the case of a parseval frame . for precise definitions of these terms ,",
    "we refer to section [ pre ] below , or to the book literature , e.g. , @xcite .    aside from applications ,",
    "at least three of the other motivations for frame theory come from : ( 1 )  wavelets , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; ( 2 )  from non - harmonic fourier expansions @xcite ; and ( 3 )  from computations with polynomials in several variables , and their generalized orthogonality relations @xcite .    while frames already have impressive uses in signal processing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , they have recently @xcite been shown to be central in our understanding of a fundamental question in operator algebras , the kadison  singer conjecture .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for up - to - date research , and to @xcite for background .",
    "in all these cases , the authors work with recursive algorithms , and the issue of _ stability _ plays a crucial role .",
    "stability , however , may obtain in situations that are much more general than the context of traditional onbs , or even tight frames .",
    "in fact , stability may apply even when we have only _ a priori _ estimates , as opposed to identities : for example , when the scaled version of parseval s identity is replaced with a pair of estimates , a fixed lower bound and an upper bound ; see ( [ eqmor.1 ] ) below . if such bounds exist , they are called lower and upper frame bounds .",
    "if a system @xmath4 of vectors in a hilbert space @xmath2 satisfies such a pair of _ a priori _ estimates , we say that @xmath4 is simply a _",
    "frame_. and if such an estimate holds only with an _ a priori _ upper bound , we say that @xmath4 is a _",
    "bessel sequence_. it is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that for a fixed hilbert space @xmath2 , the various classes of frames @xmath4 in @xmath2 may be obtained from some ambient hilbert space @xmath7 and an orthonormal basis @xmath3 in @xmath7 , i.e. , when the pair @xmath8 is given , there are choices of @xmath7 such that the frame @xmath4 may be obtained from applying a certain bounded operator @xmath9 to a suitable onb @xmath3 in @xmath7 .",
    "passing from the given structure in @xmath2 to the ambient hilbert space is called _ dilation _ in operator theory .",
    "the properties of the operator @xmath9 which does the job depend on the particular frame in question .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 is a parseval frame , then @xmath9 will be a projection of the ambient hilbert space @xmath7 onto @xmath2 .",
    "but this operator - theoretic approach to frame theory has been hampered by the fact that the ambient hilbert space is often an elusive abstraction .",
    "starting with a frame @xmath4 in a fixed hilbert space @xmath2 , then by dilation , or extension , we pass to an ambient hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we make concrete the selection of the `` magic '' operator @xmath10 which maps an onb in @xmath7 onto @xmath4 .",
    "while existence is already known , the building of a dilation system @xmath11 is often rather non - constructive , and the various methods for getting @xmath7 are fraught with choices that are not unique .",
    "nonetheless , it was shown recently @xcite that when the dilation approach is applied to parseval frames of wavelets in @xmath12 , i.e. , to wavelet bases which are not onbs , then the ambient hilbert space @xmath7 can be made completely explicit , and the constructions are algorithmic .",
    "moreover , the inflated  onb in @xmath7 then takes the form of a traditional onb - wavelet basis , a so - called super - wavelet . for details , see @xcite , and also the papers @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to show that the techniques which work well in this restricted context , super - wavelets  and redundant wavelet frames , apply to a more general and geometric context , one which is motivated in turn by extension principles in probability theory ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a key idea in our present approach is the use of reproducing hilbert spaces , and their reproducing kernels in the sense of @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an attractive formulation .",
    "we show that for every hilbert space @xmath2 , and every frame @xmath4 in @xmath2 ( even if @xmath4 is merely a bessel sequence ) , there is a way of constructing the ambient hilbert space @xmath7 in such a way that the operator @xmath9 has a concrete reproducing kernel .    finally , we mention that a recent paper @xcite serves as a second motivation for our work ; in fact @xcite contains finite - dimensional cases of two of our present theorems .",
    "these results in @xcite are theorems 2.9 and 6.4 in that paper : the results in @xcite are concerned with symmetries of tight frames , and with associated families of unitary representations of the symmetry groups .",
    "it turns out that this approach to symmetry is natural in the context of operator theory ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
