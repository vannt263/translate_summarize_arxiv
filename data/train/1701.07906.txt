    "then , using md - sd and sd simulations , we separately determined the transverse magnon frequencies that correspond to the first few @xmath97 values along all possible lattice directions . with this information at hand",
    ", we can predict the expected positions of all the two - spin - wave annihilation peaks using eq .   for both sd and md - sd case . as an example , let us consider the wave vector pair @xmath98 and @xmath99 . since @xmath100",
    ", they produce a spin wave annihilation peak in @xmath89 for @xmath101 at the frequency @xmath102 .",
    "( note that we have ignored the common pre - factor @xmath103 from the wave vectors . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : long_q_1_t_300 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we have superimposed the predicted spin wave annihilation peak positions corresponding to each case .",
    "we see an excellent match between the observed peaks and the predicted two - spin - wave peak positions , with the exception of the particular sharp peak at @xmath104mev which only appears in panel ( b ) . surprisingly , the position of this peak coincides with the frequency of the longitudinal phonon mode for the same @xmath23 as determined from the peak position of @xmath25 or @xmath32 .",
    "similar excitation peaks were observed for all wave vectors , for all system sizes and temperatures considered .",
    "the origin of these coupled phonon - magnon modes can be explained as follows .",
    "unlike transverse phonons , when a longitudinal phonon propagates along a certain lattice direction , it generates fluctuations in the local atom density along that direction with the corresponding phonon frequency .",
    "this , in turn , leads to fluctuations in the local density of the longitudinal components of the spins ( _ i.e. _ components of the spin vectors parallel to the net magnetization ) .",
    "these longitudinal spin fluctuations propagate along with the phonon , yielding a sharp , coupled mode in the the longitudinal magnon spectrum .",
    "[ fig : long_q_1_t_800 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : long_q_1_t_1000 ] show @xmath89 for @xmath91 at @xmath58k and @xmath79k , respectively , where we compare the sd results [ panel ( a ) ] with the md - sd results [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "in each figure , the inset of panel ( b ) shows the longitudinal density - density dynamic structure factor for the same wave vector . in comparison to the results for @xmath61k",
    ", we observe that the diffusive central peak becomes more pronounced as the temperature rises , and many of the low - intensity two - spin - wave peaks broaden and disappear into its tail .",
    "these observations are in qualitative agreement with previous sd studies of the ferromagnetic heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "the coupled phonon - magnon peak also becomes less pronounced with increasing temperature , as the diffusive central peak becomes more pronounced . at @xmath79k ,",
    "the intensity of the peak is very low and is barely recognizable . above the curie temperature",
    ", spins are randomly oriented and the vector sum of spins per unit volume will be zero on average . hence , the coupled phonon - magnon mode should entirely disappear ; however , it is already so faint at @xmath79k that we clearly would not have sufficient resolution to test this behavior above the curie temperature .",
    "we would like to point out that the existence of these coupled phonon - magnon modes is a phenomenon that so far hasnt been discovered experimentally .",
    "in fact , this is not surprising since the experimental detection of these peaks would be extremely challenging due to their very low intensities .",
    "to investigate collective phenomena in ferromagnetic bcc iron , we performed combined molecular and spin dynamics ( md - sd ) simulations at temperatures @xmath61k , @xmath58k , and @xmath79k . from the trajectories of these simulations ,",
    "space- and time - displaced correlation functions associated with the atomic and spin variables were calculated .",
    "fourier transforms of these quantities , namely , dynamic structure factors , directly reveal information regarding the frequencies and the lifetimes of the vibrational and magnetic excitation modes . for small @xmath51 values , the dispersion relations obtained from our simulations at @xmath61k agree well with the experimental results , but deviations can be observed for large @xmath51 values , especially for the transverse magnon dispersion curves .",
    "these discrepancies can be attributed to the anharmonic effects not being faithfully captured in the embedded atom potential and the pairwise functional representation of the exchange interaction . in fact , yin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently pointed out that the exchange parameters in bcc iron depend on the local atomic environment in a complicated manner that may not be properly characterized through a pairwise distance - dependent function .",
    "thus , a more accurate depiction of magnetic interactions necessitates the development of sophisticated models of exchange interactions that effectively capture the contribution of the local environment .    to understand the mutual influence of the phonons and magnons on each other , we compared our results with that of the standalone molecular dynamics and spin dynamics simulations . due to phonon - magnon coupling",
    ", we observe a shift in the characteristic frequencies , as well as a decrease in the lifetimes .",
    "these effects become more pronounced as the temperature is increased . moreover ,",
    "the frequency shifts and the lifetime reductions that occur in magnons due to phonons are found to be far more pronounced than the corresponding effects experienced by phonons due to magnons .",
    "this is not surprising considering the fact that the energy scale associated with the spin - spin interactions is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of the atomic ( non - magnetic ) interactions .",
    "a comparison of our results at different temperatures shows that the effects of spin - lattice coupling becomes more pronounced as the temperature rises .",
    "however , due to critical fluctuations , the size of the error bars for magnon properties increases rapidly as the temperature approaches the curie temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sss_t_fitting ] ( b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : magnon_freq_shift ] for example . ) .",
    "therefore , obtaining reliable estimates of magnon properties becomes increasingly difficult as the curie temperature is approached .",
    "the unprecedented resolution provided by our simulations has allowed us to clearly identify two - spin - wave peaks in the longitudinal spin - spin dynamic structure factor with amplitudes down to _ six orders of magnitude _ smaller than that of the highest single spin wave peak observed .",
    "in addition , in the presence of lattice vibrations , we also observe additional longitudinal magnetic excitations with frequencies which coincide with those of the longitudinal phonons .",
    "this is an unexpected form of longitudinal spin wave excitations that so far has not been detected in inelastic neutron scattering experiments , presumably due to their very low intensities .",
