    "the method of growing multilayer structures by molecular beam epitaxy was described in our work @xcite . in sample 1 , by selective doping of the central regions of the wells with relative widths 1/3 we prepared the system where the lower hubbard ( lh ) impurity band was formed . in the sample 2 by selective doping of the central regions of both wells and barriers ( with equal doping concentrations ) we prepared a system where the upper hubbard ( uh ) impurity band was partly occupied in the equilibrium .",
    "the dopant concentration @xmath6 @xmath7 was near the critical concentration for the metal - insulator transition in 2d structures , @xmath8 .",
    "the contacts were produced by firing indium with a low zinc concentration during 2 min at temperature 450 c @xmath9 .",
    "close to the room temperature , the temperature dependences of hole concentration show activation behavior caused by the transition of holes from the impurity band to valence band . from these parts of the curves we estimated the fermi energies in samples 1 and 2 - 15 - 20 mev and 6 mev , respectively . in the sample 1 fermi level",
    "is located in lh band , while in the sample 2 - in the uh band . at low temperatures conductivity of these two samples",
    "depends on temperature very weakly ( fig.1 ) .",
    "as we have shown , it can be described by the weak localization theory @xcite .    a standard antilocalization behavior ( positive magnetoresistance )",
    "was observed in our samples for magnetic fields @xmath10 t . for lower fields these two samples demonstrated also a small region of negative magnetoresistance ( nmr ) ( fig.2 ) .",
    "such a behavior was observed only for temperatures lower than @xmath11k which corresponds to the temperature of the superconducting transition in in . the nmr magnitude , @xmath12 , depends on a concrete realization of the contact . shown in fig.3",
    "is the temperature dependence of this low field nmr in the temperature region 3 - 1.2 k. one can see the increase of this nmr magnitude with a temperature decrease following by saturation at temperatures 1.2 - 0.6 k.",
    "let us consider a tunnel contact between a superconductor and a semiconductor sample .",
    "first we will discuss the situation on the metal side of the mit , that is of the tunneling between a superconductor and a normal metal .",
    "as it is known , see , e. g. , @xcite , the single - electron tunneling current can be written as : @xmath13\\ , .\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the tunneling matrix element , @xmath15 is the density of states in the 2d metal .",
    "the density of quasiparticle states in a superconductor is @xmath16 correspondingly , one obtains @xmath17   \\frac{\\left\\vert \\varepsilon\\right\\vert d\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon^{2}-\\delta^{2 } } } \\label{2}% .\\ ] ] at low temperature , @xmath18 , the integral ( [ 2 ] ) in the linear approximation in @xmath19 can be estimated as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the contact conductance when the superconductor is in the normal state .",
    "now let us consider the behavior near the critical temperature @xmath22 . in the linear regime , @xmath23 , the direct estimate of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) yields @xmath24 \\label{met}%.\\ ] ] this quasiparticle current vanishes at @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , there is also a contribution of the andreev reflections which does not vanish , ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us estimate the temperature at which the single - particle contribution crosses over to the andreev contribution .",
    "the latter can be estimated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tunneling transparency and a is a constant .",
    "the quasiparticle contribution can be rewritten as @xmath28 correspondingly , these contributions are equal at some crossover temperature @xmath29 . considering @xmath30 as given , one can estimate the tunneling transparency @xmath31 in a simple way : @xmath32 now let us consider the insulator side of the mit transition when one has tunneling between the superconductor and semiconductor in hopping regime . in this case the single - particle tunneling between semiconductor and superconductor banks can be controlled either by the direct resonant electron tunneling or by the phonon - assisted tunneling .",
    "the latter process dominates if the effective hopping energy band , @xmath33 , is less than the superconducting gap . in this case the temperature behavior of the conductance is given as @xmath34 to the contrary , if @xmath35 the contribution of resonant tunneling is expected to dominate .",
    "the character of transport is also expected to be sensitive to the strength of the tunneling barrier .",
    "indeed , transport in the semiconductor is controlled by the percolation cluster which allows self - averaging of the conductivity .",
    "thus the contact resistance is the resistance between the superconductor and the percolation cluster .",
    "it consists of a sum of the resistance related to the last hop between some localized state in the semiconductor and the superconductor , and the resistance of the branch connecting this localized state to the percolation cluster . if the tunnel barrier transparency @xmath31 is much less that the typical hopping exponent @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the typical hopping length , than the contact resistance is dominated by the `` last '' hop . in its turn",
    ", the contact conductance is a sum of the conductances corresponding to these hops .",
    "this fact allows us to average over these conductances ( see @xcite . for each of the localized state",
    "@xmath38 the corresponding conductance is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coordinate normal to the contact .",
    "correspondingly , for the average one has @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the densities of localized states in semiconductor and metal respectively .",
    "evaluating the expression ( [ 7 ] ) one obtains @xmath44    now let us consider the situation when @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the contact between the superconductor and the percolation cluster is supported by some branches of hopping resistors .",
    "since these branches are in parallel , the conductance of this structure is given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the resistance of the hop form the last localized state to superconductor , while @xmath48 is the resistance of the branch connecting this last hop with the percolation cluster .",
    "one can separate the contact contribution to resistance as @xmath49 since the branches support the current flow through the system , according to ideas of the percolation theory they should also be considered as a part of the percolation cluster .",
    "thus one expects that all of @xmath48 are of the order of that corresponding to the percolation threshold , @xmath50 .",
    "so the only average should be taken with respect to the localized state @xmath38 corresponding to the last hop , actually - with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "one notes that the upper limit for @xmath51 is given by some critical value , @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath52 .",
    "the larger resistances do not enter the percolation cluster .",
    "then , one notes that for @xmath53 one has @xmath54 and the corresponding paths do not contribute effectively to the contact resistance .",
    "thus only a small part of the branches given by a ratio @xmath55 is important for the contact magnetoresistance .    combining this estimate with the one given by eq .",
    "( [ gss ] ) one notes that for the hopping conductivity the contact magnetoresistance is suppressed with respect to the metal conductor due to the two issues : ( i ) since the hopping energy band width @xmath33 entering eq .",
    "( [ gss ] ) is larger than @xmath56 entering eq .",
    "( [ met ] ) and additional factor @xmath57 appears at @xmath58 ; ( ii ) in contrast to a metal , in the hopping case only small part of tunneling events contributes to the contact magnetoresistance which gives a factor @xmath59 . as a result ,",
    "the contact magnetoresistance in hopping regime is suppressed with respect to metal by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "actually the measurable quantity is a sum of the the contact resistance and the sample resistance .",
    "so an increase of the sample resistance in the hopping regime @xmath61 means a decrease of _ relative _ magnetoresistance if the latter originates from the contact contribution . as a result",
    ", a suppression of the _ relative _ magnetoresistance in the hopping regime is given by the factor @xmath62 rather than by a factor @xmath63 as one may conclude from naive considerations .",
    "note that as concerns the hopping regime we restricted ourselves by single particle tunneling . according to eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , this channel is exponentially frozen out at @xmath64 .",
    "this conclusion still holds if the tunnel barrier is weak or even absent since it is based on the single - particle character of transport impossible in a superconductor at @xmath65 .",
    "as well known for the interface between a superconductor and a normal metal it is the two - particle andreev reflections that are responsible for the low temperature transport .",
    "however the typical processes leading to hopping transport are single - particle ones .",
    "note that the activation exponential factor @xmath66 ) at small temperatures can be much smaller than variable range hopping factor @xmath67 .",
    "this is the case e.g. for studies @xcite of hopping transport in cdte structures with in contacts where the temperatures were as low as @xmath68mk .",
    "thus a process similar to the andreev reflection , i. e involving tunneling of cooper pairs , should be considered . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no detailed studies of such transport were reported until now .",
    "we are going to address this topic in a special paper .",
    "as clearly seen , the nmr at low fields can be only related to presence of a superconductor since the effect is absent at @xmath69 . in principle",
    ", the magnetoresistance could be also related to interference contribution to andreev tunneling , see e. g. @xcite .",
    "however , our samples being close to mit correspond to a limit of extreme dirty metal and thus characteristic magnetic field scales for the interference effects are much larger than critical magnetic field for in ( see e. g. our studies @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the observed peak occurs at @xmath70 t , that is of the order of the critical field for in but much less than required for the interference effects .    in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the magnitude of the magnetoresistance peak as a function of temperature for the sample on the metal side of mit . as it is seen , it is proportional to @xmath71 in the vicinity of @xmath72 . that agrees with eq . ( [ met ] ) , @xmath73 since according to the bcs theory @xmath74 .    for lower temperatures",
    "( [ low ] ) predicts exponential increase of magnetoresistance which can be seen from fig .",
    "3 . with a further decrease of temperature the magnetoresistance saturates due to a bypassing of the andreev channel . according to eq .",
    "[ cross ] , the crossover temperature allows us to estimate the tunnel barrier transparency . making use of the experimental data",
    "one concludes that @xmath75 k. it is well known that the superconducting transition temperature for in is @xmath76 k and thus @xmath77k . substituting @xmath78 and @xmath79 into eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) we estimate the tunneling probability as @xmath80 .    on the fig .",
    "3 we have also plotted theoretical curve resulting from the summation of the single - particle contribution calculated above and the contribution of the andreev tunneling .",
    "unfortunately the proper analysis of this latter channel at temperatures close to @xmath81 is difficult due to the fact that our `` normal metal '' is actually a dirty semiconductor and is characterized by rather small spin - orbital scattering times ( @xmath82 ) and phase relaxation times ( @xmath83 ) @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the detailed theory of andreev reflections in the vicinity of @xmath72 with an account of the factors mentioned above is absent .",
    "we have concluded that the best fitting of the experimental data is obtained if we approximate the andreev channel contribution at @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "now let us turn to the magnetoresistance in the hopping regime . as follows from fig .",
    "2 , in the hopping regime there is no trace of the magnetoresistance peak at @xmath86 k with an accuracy at least of the order of @xmath87 .",
    "note that the corresponding magnitude of the relative magnetoresistance peak in the metal sample was of the order of @xmath88 , fig .",
    "2 . such a suppression of the relative magnetoresistance in the hopping regime can hardly be explained by a simple increase of resistance .",
    "indeed , the latter is larger than that of the metal sample only by a factor @xmath89 .",
    "however , this behavior is easily explained by our eq .",
    "( [ hop ] ) predicting much stronger suppression of the magnetoresistance than following from the resistance ratio . in our opinion",
    ", this effect can be used to discriminate between the regimes of weak and localization even in the crossover region between the two regimes .",
    "the reason is in the principal differences in the physical picture of transport between the regimes which are not clearly seen in the value of the resistance itself .",
    "this is why we believe that our model is adequate for the experimental findings .    to conclude , we studied magnetoresistance of 2d p - gaas / algaas structures with superconducting electrodes ( in ) close to the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we demonstrated that the observed weak field magnetoresistance peak observed for metallic samples is due to restoration of the single - particle tunneling through the superconductor - semiconductor boundary with suppression of superconductivity .",
    "the crossover between the two tunneling regimes allowed us to estimate the tunneling transparency .",
    "the samples on the dielectric side of mit did not demonstrate such a peak .",
    "the suppression of the magnetoresistance peak in the hopping regime is confirmed by theoretical analysis .",
    "we suggest to use this effect for discrimination between the regimes of weak and strong localization .",
