    "despite spectacular progress in recent years , the reionization history of the universe remains shrouded in mystery .",
    "the high electron scattering optical depth observed by wmap indicates that reionization may have begun as early as @xmath8 ( kogut et al 2003 ; spergel et al 2003 ) .",
    "on the other hand , spectra of high redshift quasars indicate a sharp change in the neutral hydrogen fraction and ionizing background at @xmath9 , suggesting this era marks the end of the reionization epoch ( becker et al 2001 , fan et al 2002 ) . taken in tandem ,",
    "these observations suggest a highly complex reionization history .    a crucial missing piece of the puzzle is the precise ionization state of the igm at @xmath10 .",
    "the large optical depth of the igm to hydrogen lyman transitions implies that gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) absorption can ( at best ) constrain the volume and mass - weighted neutral fractions to be @xmath11 respectively ( fan et al 2002 ) .",
    "it is plausible that the igm is still highly ionized at @xmath10 , and with full reionization occurring much earlier . on the other hand , modeling of the spectral regions around two quasars at @xmath12",
    "may indicate larger neutral fractions ( @xmath13 ; wyithe & loeb 2004a ; mesinger & haiman 2004 ) . at stake",
    "is the very nature of reionization : if these claims are correct , then reionization must be an extremely rapid process , since the igm is known to be highly ionized ( @xmath14 ) by @xmath15 along all observed lines of sight ( fan et al 2003 ) .",
    "it is thus worth considering the igm absorption in more detail .",
    "in particular , a completely dark gunn - peterson trough at @xmath9 is not necessarily universal .",
    "both the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath1 troughs of the highest redshift quasar found to date , sdss j1148@xmath35251 , contain detectable flux ( white et al 2003 ) . in this _",
    ", we show that its previous interpretation as continuum contamination from an interloper galaxy at @xmath4 is inconsistent with the observed flux ratios blueward and redward of the expected continuum break due to ly@xmath0 forest absorption . therefore , some of the flux is true transmission due to holes in the high redshift ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "we derive our strongest contraints from the ly@xmath5 trough , which was ignored in previous analyses and should be relatively uncontaminated by flux from an interloper .",
    "the presence of flux transmission implies that either the igm is still highly ionized at @xmath10 or that there is significant cosmic variance in the reionization epoch along different lines of sight .",
    "detectable flux and a network of transmission features is seen in both the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath1 troughs of sdss j1148@xmath35251 .",
    "white et al ( 2003 ) interpreted this to be continuum contamination from interloper galaxies at @xmath4 for two reasons : ( i ) strong absorption features appear at @xmath16 , so the apparent strong ly@xmath1 spikes at @xmath17 could just be ly@xmath0 emission from @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) the flux ratios of the troughs appear inconsistent : there is too little light in the ly@xmath1 trough given the ly@xmath0 transmission .",
    "although the _ a priori _ probability of such an interloper is small , it increases if the interloper also lenses sdss j1148@xmath35251 , boosting its probability of detection .    by examining the ly@xmath5 trough of sdss j1148@xmath35251",
    ", we argue that such an interpretation is untenable .",
    "we first note that if residual flux in _ any _ of the ly@xmath19 troughs can be attributed to the quasar rather than an interloper galaxy , the igm must still be highly ionized along the line of sight .",
    "consider the boundary of the quasar proximity zone at @xmath20 , where the ly@xmath0 , ly@xmath1 absorption increase rapidly .",
    "_ there is also a sharp jump in absorption at the boundary of the ly@xmath5 trough , strongly suggesting that the transmission features redward of the ly@xmath5 trough are genuine_. even if we exclude the sharp transmission spike at @xmath21   ( putatively a ly@xmath0 emission line from a galaxy at @xmath4 ) , the residual flux changes from @xmath22 ( within the quasar proximity zone ) to @xmath23 ( outside the quasar proximity zone ) , where @xmath24 is the flux @xmath25 in units of @xmath26 @xmath27",
    ". it would be remarkable if the protocluster at @xmath28 lined up so as to exactly coincide with the quasar proximity zone in ly@xmath5 : it is much more likely that the sudden change is due to genuine ly@xmath5 absorption .",
    "this suggests the flux seen in the ly@xmath1 forest at @xmath29 , before the onset of ly@xmath5 absorption , represents true transmission .",
    "it is also crucial that there is detectable flux in the ly@xmath5 trough .",
    "consider the wavelength stretch corresponding to @xmath30 in the various absorption troughs .",
    "this lies outside the quasar s apparent region of influence and ends where the ly@xmath5 trough becomes contaminated by ly@xmath31 and higher order absorption ( @xmath32  , corresponding to @xmath33 ) .",
    "white et al ( 2003 ) suggest that the ly@xmath0 , ly@xmath1 troughs are contaminated by continuum emission from the interloper galaxy so that detected flux is not significant . to be conservative ,",
    "let us ignore the transmitted flux in the ly@xmath1 trough , which is potentially also contaminated by emission line features from the @xmath28 proto - cluster .",
    "we find that @xmath24(ly@xmath0)@xmath34 while @xmath24(ly@xmath5)@xmath35 ; these regions correspond to @xmath36   and @xmath37   in the rest frame of an interloper galaxy at @xmath4 . _",
    "these flux ratios are strongly inconsistent with the expected continuum of a @xmath28 galaxy , which should have a strong break due to the intervening ly@xmath0 forest_. songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) obtain a flux suppression factor @xmath38 for the ly@xmath0 forest in this redshift and wavelength interval ( becker et al 2003 find @xmath39 ) .",
    "even if the flux in the ly@xmath0 trough is entirely due to continuum contamination from the interloper , the implied continuum contribution to the ly@xmath5 trough would be @xmath40(ly@xmath5 ) , which lies well within the noise .",
    "thus , almost all the observed flux in the ly@xmath5 trough must be genuine transmitted flux from the quasar . because it is almost completely free from continuum contamination , the ly@xmath5 trough places the strongest constraint on the igm ionization state along this line of sight .",
    "ccrrrrrlll ly@xmath0 & @xmath41 & ( 2560,1730,1690 ) & @xmath42 & @xmath42 & @xmath42 & @xmath42 + ly@xmath1 & @xmath43 & ( 2140,1870,1710 ) & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + ly@xmath5 & @xmath48 & ( 2070,1910,1710 ) & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52    because there are indisputably absorbers at @xmath16 , the putative protocluster may conceivably have another effect : it could ionize the igm at @xmath53 , creating a transparent ly@xmath0 window there .",
    "however , the proximity zone of the interloper galaxy itself is too small . we need to highly ionize the igm on comoving lengthscales @xmath54 mpc at @xmath53 . if the flux in the ly@xmath0 trough is interpreted as the continuum of the interloper , then @xmath55 .",
    "if we take @xmath56 as is observed in @xmath57 lbgs ( steidel et al 2001 ) for the strongest ionizing continuum possible ( corresponding to a @xmath58 escape fraction for ionizing photons ) , then we infer @xmath59 , roughly implying a star formation rate @xmath60 for a salpeter imf .",
    "assuming the mean background ionizing rate in units of @xmath61 to be @xmath62",
    "( e.g. , fig 2 of fan et al 2002 ) , the local radiation field becomes comparable to the metagalactic ionizing at @xmath63 mpc comoving , far too small to be of interest .",
    "lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath64 also show excess ly@xmath0 transmission on lengthscales @xmath65 mpc comoving ( adelberger et al 2003 ) , roughly corresponding to the distance a @xmath66 wind would travel on the @xmath67 myr star formation timescale of lbgs .",
    "it is unlikely a @xmath53 galaxy would affect a significantly larger volume .",
    "galaxies near ( but not along ) the line of sight could contribute additional ionizing photons .",
    "note , however , that we require a factor @xmath68 increase in @xmath69 over a lengthscale @xmath70 times larger than the comoving correlation length for highly biased galaxies .",
    "there is no evidence for such strong fluctuations in transmission at this redshift : typically @xmath71 ( songaila & cowie 2002 ) . in any case",
    ", an anomalously large protocluster should be easily visible in narrowband optical searches .",
    "having established the reality of residual flux from sdss j1148@xmath35251 , we will now consider its implications for reionization at @xmath72 .",
    "we must first estimate the effective optical depths @xmath73 in each transition .",
    "we begin by summarizing our methodology and the error budget ( which is frequently underestimated ) .    the errors for ly@xmath5 transmission @xmath74 must include not only pixel noise but also the cosmic variance in foreground transmission in ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath1 .",
    "previous analyses have often neglected this additional scatter .",
    "it has been measured in quasar samples ; we use the values in table 2 of songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) , who tabulate the measured @xmath75 for 6 redshift bins between @xmath76 . however , these use fixed wavelength intervals , and @xmath77 obviously depends on the corresponding comoving length @xmath78 .",
    "we can not simply assume poisson statistics , because long wavelength modes could dominate the variance . to estimate @xmath77 we follow the _ ansatz _ of lidz et al ( 2002 ) , who argue that the transmission power spectrum takes the shape ( though not the normalization ) of the linear mass power spectrum on large scales , yielding : @xmath79^{2 } p_{f}(k ) + \\frac{\\sigma_{n}^{2}}{n } , \\label{eqn : sigmaf}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the noise per pixel , @xmath81 is the number of pixels , and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the jeans wavenumber , and @xmath85 is normalized to the observed @xmath77 for some observed stretch @xmath86 .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eqn : sigmaf ] ) typically dominates by an order of magnitude . for the large lengthscales of interest",
    ", @xmath87 is fairly flat , and we have approximately @xmath88 , as expected for a white noise power spectrum .",
    "note that this _ ansatz _ for the transmission power spectrum @xmath87 assumes a homogeneous ionizing background @xmath89 ; if @xmath89 exhibits small - scale fluctuations , @xmath77 could be larger .",
    "however , there is _ no _ cosmic variance in @xmath90 , because we have observed the corresponding ly@xmath0 transmission ( at @xmath91 ) along the same line of sight .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the optical depth conversion between different lines ( see below ) .",
    "another crucial item is uncertainty in the quasar continuum .",
    "this is particularly important in comparing relative absorption between the different troughs .",
    "the ly@xmath0 line is much broader than the ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath5 lines and generally spills over into the observed trough .",
    "uncertainty in the strength of the line creates significant uncertainty in the inferred @xmath92 . a simple way to quantify",
    "this is to compare the optical depths inferred assuming the composite spectrum from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; brotherton et al 2001 ) and the far - uv quasar power law spectrum of telfer et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the former includes all the emission line structure , while the latter assumes a pure power law ; the difference between the two therefore captures the uncertainty in emission line contribution .",
    "we normalize the continuum to the observed flux at @xmath93 .",
    "table 1 lists the measured effective line optical depths @xmath94(ly@xmath0 ) and their associated @xmath95 errors .",
    "the results for the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath1 line optical depths are comparable to those of white et al .",
    "they argued that the pair are incompatible with each other , because @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the oscillator strength of line @xmath98 ) , implying @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "however , these relations are only true at fixed density , and only apply if the igm is homogeneous . for the large comoving lengths which we are considering ,",
    "the flux transmission comes from a variety of densities : @xmath101 p(\\delta ) d\\delta , \\label{eqn : flux_transmission}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the probability distribution of overdensities @xmath103 , @xmath104 ( e.g. , hui & gnedin 1997 ) in the optically thin limit , and @xmath105 is the recombination coefficient .",
    "we use the form of @xmath102 given by miralda - escud , haehnelt & rees ( 2000 ) , which is a good fit to numerical simulations .",
    "if we assume an equation of state @xmath106 ( where @xmath107@xmath108 ) and a fluctuating radiation field whose amplitude may be density dependent , @xmath109 , then @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "we can solve for the normalization constant @xmath112 by demanding @xmath113 . note that @xmath114 .",
    "the integral in equation ( [ eqn : flux_transmission ] ) can be evaluated by the method of steepest descents ( songaila & cowie 2002 , songaila 2004 ) : @xmath115 the leading term implies that @xmath116 for @xmath117 ( corresponding to a uniform radiation field and an isothermal equation of state ) .",
    "thus , in an inhomogeneous universe the optical depth increases more slowly than linearly with the oscillator strength ; conversely , it increases more slowly with a weaker radiation field .",
    "evaluating equation ( [ eqn : flux_transmission ] ) numerically , we find that @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , with weak dependence on redshift , the equation of state , and @xmath89 .",
    "this is because transmission is dominated by rare voids , and the primary effect of decreasing @xmath120 is to increase the range of densities sampled by the line .",
    "this behaviour becomes even more marked if @xmath89 is not uniform , which is certainly the case before reionization is complete . as a fiducial case ,",
    "consider a uniform radiation field @xmath121 at @xmath122 , which produces a ly@xmath0 effective optical depth @xmath123 . in this case , @xmath124 .",
    "now let us consider various scenarios that would produce the same @xmath92 but different @xmath125 .",
    "suppose the optical depth @xmath126 has @xmath127 , which could , for example , mimic self - shielding in overdense regions .",
    "in this case , from equation ( [ eqn : tau_eff ] ) , the optical depth increases even more slowly with oscillator strength : for @xmath128 , ( @xmath129 . only if the optical depth is independent of overdensity ( @xmath130 ) will we recover the linear scaling @xmath131 .",
    "fluctuations in the radiation field that are uncorrelated with density fluctuations ( so that @xmath132 ) will produce similar effects .",
    "for example , a radiation field with a lognormal probability distribution @xmath133 yields @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the fluctuating density and radiation fields introduce considerable uncertainty in the relations between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the effective optical depth is often used to infer @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the igm , a procedure that we caution is fraught with uncertainty . in the case of @xmath139",
    ", it is almost meaningless .",
    "it is easy to see why : we can infer @xmath140 from @xmath141 only in the limit where @xmath142 and @xmath143 ; otherwise , our ignorance of the full probability distribution @xmath144 means that a wide variety of @xmath145 would be consistent with a given observed @xmath146 . as an illustration , we show in figure  1 the logarithmic integrand @xmath147 , for various quantities @xmath148 ; all the curves have been normalized to have unit area . since @xmath141 is heavily weighted toward voids and @xmath145 is weighted toward overdense regions , estimating one from the other is extremely model - dependent .",
    "in particular , @xmath138 is heavily weighted toward large overdensities , and the quasar spectra essentially leave it unconstrained .",
    "for instance , the neutral fraction could be considerably lower in overdense regions without affecting the transmitted flux .    with these caveats , we list @xmath149 derived from each of the three transitions in the rightmost columns of table  1 for @xmath150 . the flux ratios in all 3 troughs",
    "are entirely consistent with flux transmission from the quasar without any contamination from an interloper : the equivalent ly@xmath0 optical depths all lie within @xmath151 of one another .",
    "the apparent inconsistency in white et al ( 2003 ) appears simply because they did not integrate over the igm density distribution .",
    "again , we caution that the optical depth conversion between different transitions has large uncertainties ( not reflected in the error bars ) due to uncertainty in the probability distribution of optical depths @xmath144 . the true effective optical depth inferred from the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath1 troughs",
    "could also be somewhat higher if there is some continuum contribution from an interloper , which we can not completely rule out .",
    "the most stringent optical depth constraint comes from the ly@xmath5 trough , which implies @xmath152 , with a most likely value @xmath153@xmath154 . by contrast , in sdss j1030@xmath30524 , the @xmath95 ( @xmath155 ) lower limit to the optical depth in the ly@xmath1 trough is @xmath156 ( 9.9 ) ; the ly@xmath5 trough yields similar constraints .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have argued that the residual flux in the ly@xmath157 , and @xmath5 troughs of sdss j1148 + 5251 is not due to an interloper galaxy but represents true transmission in the @xmath158 igm .",
    "this places an upper bound on the effective ly@xmath0 optical depth of @xmath159 , implying that the igm is still highly ionized at @xmath160 .",
    "it has been argued that the size of the regions of the two highest redshift quasars @xmath161 mpc imply @xmath162 in this range ( wyithe & loeb 2004a ) : @xmath163 mpc , where @xmath164 is the lifetime of the quasar .",
    "this is of course strongly dependent on the assumed template spectrum ; if the escape fraction of ionizing photons in high - redshift quasars is somehow smaller , the constraint weakens .",
    "the quasars could also be lensed and hence intrinsically fainter ( haiman & cen 2002 ) , though follow - up hst observations have failed to detect multiple images in either quasar ( white et al 2004 in preparation ) . for our purpose , we note that region radius is determined by the mass - weighted neutral fraction @xmath138 . as we showed in  [ section : tau ] ,",
    "this is very poorly constrained by @xmath73 , because voids containing only a small fraction of the mass dominate the transmission .",
    "for instance , if @xmath165 of the baryons are in neutral self - shielded halos , we could still have @xmath166 , which could easily be accommodated by our results .    a second argument in favor of @xmath167 is an indirect detection of the gunn - peterson damping wing ( mesinger & haiman 2004 ) .",
    "there is a stretch at the boundary of the region of sdss j1030 + 0524 with ly@xmath1 transmission but no ly@xmath0 transmission , implying @xmath168 .",
    "the absence of any ly@xmath0 transmission from low - density voids in this segment implies a source of smooth opacity , attributed to a ly@xmath0 damping wing that requires a large optical depth @xmath169",
    ". however , sdss j1148@xmath35251 contains no such transition region .",
    "we also caution that the statistical significance of such transition regions is still unclear .",
    "for instance , in sdss j1148@xmath35251 there is a stretch from @xmath170 with ly@xmath1 transmission ( @xmath171 ) but no significant ly@xmath0 flux ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "again , the optical depth ratios are consistent with pure flux transmission ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) .",
    "this stretch is @xmath175 times longer than the @xmath176 zone seen in sdss j1030@xmath30524 , over which even damping wing absorption would change substantially ; in any case , we have argued that the igm is highly ionized along this stretch .",
    "such regions may therefore be fairly generic and not indicative of a damping wing .",
    "more detailed analysis , incorporating a pixel - by - pixel analysis , variance in the foreground ly@xmath0 forest , and better theoretical modeling of the fluctuating radiation and density fields in realistic models of reionization , would help shed light on this issue .",
    "nonetheless , if the region around sdss j1030@xmath30524 is significantly neutral , this may be a hint of large cosmic variance in the epoch of reionization .",
    "indeed , a strongly fluctuating @xmath73 is itself a signature of the pre - overlap era . in the extreme interpretation that the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath1 troughs of sdss j1030@xmath30524 indicate @xmath177 down to @xmath178 , this implies large modulation in the ionization fraction and typical bubble sizes of order @xmath179 , or @xmath180 mpc comoving .",
    "this is substantially larger than the regions of these extremely bright and rare quasars , @xmath181 mpc comoving .",
    "it is also larger than theoretical expectations for the scale of typical regions at the tail end of reionization ( furlanetto et al .",
    "2004 ; wyithe & loeb 2004b ) , so we consider such a scenario to be extremely unlikely . at the other extreme ,",
    "the measured @xmath73 are compatible with a slightly faster increase in @xmath73 along the sightline to sdss j1030@xmath30524 ( @xmath182 ,  2@xmath183 ) , than to sdss j1148@xmath35251 , ( @xmath184@xmath154 ) .",
    "whether a highly - ionized universe can tolerate such scatter is unclear .",
    "we have shown that a simple @xmath73 analysis is a blunt instrument , and more sophisticated interpretation is required to put strong constraints on reionization .",
    "note that surveys of ly@xmath0 emitters have found no evolution of the luminosity function of ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( malhotra & rhoads 2004 , stern et al 2004 ) , which has been interpreted as evidence against percolation taking place at @xmath187 , in agreement with our conclusions .",
    "what other signatures of large ly@xmath0 optical depth could emerge from the spectra ?",
    "one possibility is the absorption forest ( oh 2002 ) .",
    "is an excellent tracer of neutral hydrogen : it has a very similar ionization potential @xmath188ev , so it lies in tight charge exchange equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , its @xmath189   absorption line lies redward of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "although the forest coincides with a noisy portion of the night sky , the sightline to sdss j1030@xmath30524 ( which may contain substantially neutral regions ) has no lines with @xmath190   and perhaps @xmath191 lines with @xmath192   ( x. fan , private communication ) .",
    "significantly more lines are expected if the universe is substantially neutral ( oh 2002 ) , although this is model - dependent .",
    "the forest clearly merits further investigation , though a good standard star calibration is essential to removing strong telluric features from the atmosphere .",
