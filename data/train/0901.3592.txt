    "second they are shielded against both of @xmath67-decay and @xmath86-decay by stable isobars and thus they are produced only by direct nuclear reactions , for example ( @xmath2,n ) reactions from heavy isotopes or ( @xmath98,e@xmath99 ) reactions from isobars .",
    "@xmath21la : as the origin of @xmath21la , the cosmic - ray process @xcite and the @xmath9-process @xcite were proposed .",
    "a result that about 90% in the solar abundance of @xmath21la can be explained by the @xmath9 process was reported @xcite and the contribution of a key charged current reaction to @xmath21la was quantitatively evaluated @xcite .",
    "a study of primitive meteorites provides a hint about the origin of @xmath21la .",
    "shen and lee ( 2003 ) reported the isotope abundance anomalies of several elements as ti and la in ca - al - rich inclusions , which is considered to originated from the early solar nebula .",
    "the abundance ratios of @xmath21la/@xmath100la is correlated with that of @xmath101ti/@xmath102ti @xcite .",
    "the reason why @xmath21la is correlated with @xmath101ti has been an open question .",
    "@xmath22ta : the origin of @xmath22ta is one of hot topics in the nuclear astrophysics since @xmath22ta has a unique feature that the meta - stable state in @xmath22ta is the only isomer ( half - life of @xmath103 10@xmath104 yr ) existing in the solar system , while the ground state is unstable state against @xmath8 -decay ( half - life of 8 hr ) . as the origin of @xmath22ta , the @xmath1-process @xcite , and the @xmath2-process @xcite , the @xmath9-process @xcite and the cosmic - ray process @xcite were suggested .",
    "a recent @xmath9-process calculation overproduces the solar abundance of @xmath22ta relative to @xmath105o , which based on a new experimental result using a @xmath22hf(@xmath106he , t)@xmath22ta reaction to evaluate the charged current reaction rate @xcite .    in explosive nucleosynthesis such as the @xmath2- and @xmath9-processes , the population ratio of the meta - stable isomer to the @xmath8-unstable ground state at freezeout of a nucleosynthesis process is an important factor . the transition probability from the isomer to the ground state",
    "was measured using real photons @xcite and the population ratio by a ( @xmath2,n ) reaction was also measured @xcite . to estimate exactly the residual abundance of @xmath22ta ,",
    "a time - dependent calculation is required . however , for the estimation of the isomer population , a thermal equilibrium approximation @xcite are widely used , wherein the population ratio of the isomer to the ground state can be calculated by the maxwell - boltzmann population at critical temperature @xmath107 that is the lowest temperature of the thermal equilibrium region .",
    "it should be noted that exited states located above the isomer are also populated in high temperature environments and may decay to the isomer .",
    "on other words , the excited states above the isomer also contribute the residual abundance of @xmath22ta .",
    "mohr et al . ( 2007 ) calculated the temperature of @xmath107 based on measured transition probability @xcite and concluded @xmath107 is 40.4 kev which leads to @xmath108 of 0.35 .",
    "here we discussed the population of the isomer under the thermal equilibrium approximation .",
    "a population of an excited state is followed to the maxwell - boltzmann population presented by @xmath109 in a temperature range of @xmath110 = 0.1 - 1.0 , all excited states lower than a few hundred kev energy are populated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:180ta ] ) .",
    "after the freezeout , the each excited state decays to the ground state or the isomer .",
    "the final population ratio of the isomer to the total is presented by @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 indicate levels decaying to the isomer and the ground state , respectively .",
    "we calculate the contribution of the excited levels presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:180ta ] , since the contribution of the higher levels is lower than 0.1% . in previous calculations , the residual ratio of 0.3 - 0.5",
    "have been used @xcite .",
    "however , the present calculated ratios are 0.06 , 0.13 , 0.20 , and 0.26 for the assumed critical temperature of @xmath114 = 0.20 , 0.25 , 0.30 , and 0.35 , respectively .",
    "this result shows that the residual abundance of @xmath22ta should decrease against the previous estimations if the thermal equilibrium is a good approximation .",
    "we present two empirical scaling laws concerning the @xmath0- and @xmath1-nuclei with the same atomic number in the solar system abundances . the first @xmath0-nucleus and the second @xmath0-nucleus are lighter than the @xmath1-nucleus by two and four neutrons , respectively",
    "the first scaling is the correlation between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-nuclei .",
    "the corrected n@xmath23/n@xmath24(1st p ) and n@xmath23/n@xmath24(2nd p ) ratios are almost constant over a wide region of the atomic number and are mostly centered around 23 within a factor of 2 .",
    "these scalings are a piece of evidence that the @xmath2-process is the most probable origin of the twenty - seven @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "the scalings in the solar system lead to a novel concept `` the universality of the @xmath2-process '' that the abundance ratios n(s)/n(p ) produced by individual sn @xmath2-processes are almost constant over a wide region of the atomic number .",
    "the @xmath2-process calculations of core - collapse sne under various astrophysical conditions support the universality of the @xmath2-process .",
    "three mechanisms contribute to the universality .",
    "the first mechanism is the weak @xmath1-process .",
    "it is well known that light elements of @xmath66 @xmath28 90 are produced by successive neutron capture reactions from iron seeds in the weak @xmath1-process .",
    "however , pre - exiting heavy elements of @xmath66 @xmath3 90 are also irradiated by neutrons and their mass distribution is changed locally to that of the main @xmath1-process in asymptotic giant branch stars . therefore , the mass distribution patterns of the seed nuclei at the supernova explosions are almost identical .",
    "the second mechanism is the shifts of the mass regions of the @xmath2-process layers to keep their peak temperature .",
    "the @xmath2-process layers are shifted to outer layers as the explosion energy or mass increases . inside the @xmath2-process layers ,",
    "the seed nuclei are completely destroyed by photodisintegration reactions , whereas the @xmath0-nuclei outside the @xmath2-process layers are not synthesized because of their low temperature .",
    "therefore , the physical conditions of the @xmath2-process layers are almost identical .",
    "the third mechanism is independence from two nucleosynthesis flows .",
    "the @xmath0-nuclei are produced by the two flows : direct ( @xmath2,n ) reactions from heavier isotopes , and @xmath8-decay after downflow by ( @xmath2,p ) and ( @xmath2,@xmath27 ) reactions from heavier elements which may break the scalings .",
    "we calculated the contributions of both the flows for each @xmath0-nucleus .",
    "the ( @xmath2,n ) reactions are dominant in the light mass region of @xmath19 @xmath28 82 .",
    "the @xmath8-decay after the downflow contributes to the @xmath0-nucleus abundances in the heavy mass region of @xmath19 @xmath3 82 but does not drastically change the abundance ratios because both the p- and s - nuclei are populated by @xmath8-decay in most cases . in this way ,",
    "the scalings hold for individual @xmath2-processes .",
    "in addition , we find that large deviations of n@xmath24(s)/n@xmath24(p ) for ce , er , and w in the solar system are a piece of evidence that the weak @xmath1-process actually occurred before sne .",
    "the present calculated results suggest an extended universality that the n(s)/n(p ) ratios produced in individual sne may be constant around a specific value of 3 independent of the stellar conditions . with the extended universality of n@xmath73(s)/n@xmath73(p )",
    "= 3 and the first scaling of n@xmath24(s)/n@xmath24(p ) = 23 , we estimate that the ratio of the @xmath1-process abundance contribution from the agb stars to the massive stars associated with sne is about 6.7 for the @xmath1-nuclei of @xmath66 @xmath3 90 in the solar system .",
    "an astronomical observation with indium isotope separation is useful for the verification of the extended universality",
    ". this observation can give a crucial impact on the identification of the @xmath2-process site and gce for @xmath0- and @xmath1-nuclei .",

    "<S> analyzing the solar system abundances , we have found two empirical abundance scaling laws concerning the @xmath0- and @xmath1-nuclei with the same atomic number . </S>",

    "<S> the second scaling is p / p ratios are almost constant , where the second @xmath0-nuclei are lighter than the first @xmath0-nucleus by two neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> these scalings are a piece of evidence that most @xmath0-nuclei are dominantly synthesized by the @xmath2-process in supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> the scalings lead to a novel concept of `` universality of @xmath2-process '' that the s / p and p / p ratios of nuclei produced by individual @xmath2-processes are almost constant , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the ratios by @xmath2-process based on core - collapse supernova explosion models under various astrophysical conditions and found that the scalings hold for materials produced by individual @xmath2-processes independent of the astrophysical conditions assumed . </S>",
    "<S> the universality originates from three mechanisms : the shifts of the @xmath2-process layers to keep their peak temperature , the weak @xmath1-process in pre - supernovae , and the independence of the s / p ratios of the nuclear reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the results further suggest an extended universality that the s / p ratios in the @xmath2-process layers are not only constant but also centered on a specific value of 3 . with this specific value and the first scaling </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that the ratios of @xmath1-process abundance contributions from the agb stars to the massive stars are almost 6.7 for the @xmath1-nuclei of a @xmath3 90 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that large enhancements of s / p ratios for ce , er , and w are a piece of evidence that the weak @xmath1-process actually occurred before sne . </S>"
