    "( [ eq : beta ] ) , could be changed at high redshift without significantly affecting the model predictions at @xmath50 . in  [ sec : variants ] we will therefore experiment with different values of these parameters and will also consider a modified functional form for @xmath44 .",

    "we consider the effects of changing both @xmath17 and the imf in  [ sec : variants ] .      the standard semi - analytic model of allows hot halo gas to cool only via collisional radiative processes . at high redshift",
    ", compton cooling due to free electrons in the hot plasma scattering off cmb photons becomes important .",
    "the compton cooling timescale is given by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ionized fraction of the hot halo gas , @xmath56 is the temperature of the cmb at the present day and @xmath57 is the temperature of electrons in the hot halo gas , which we set equal to the virial temperature of the halo . at high redshifts",
    "this cooling time becomes shorter than the hubble time and so compton cooling may be effective at these redshifts . to implement eqn .",
    "( [ eq : compton ] ) in the semi - analytic model , we assume that the shock - heated halo gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium , and use values for @xmath58 which we interpolate from the tabulated values given by . in halos with virial temperatures",
    "less than around @xmath59k collisional ionization is ineffective , and so the ionized fraction in the halo gas will equal the residual ionization fraction left over from recombination .",
    "however , since this fraction is small , we will simply assume in this paper that cooling in halos below @xmath59k is negligible .",
    "it should be noted that , unlike the radiative cooling time , the compton cooling time is independent of the gas density and depends only very weakly on the gas temperature .",
    "whereas with collisional radiative cooling a cooling radius , within which the cooling time is less than the age of the halo , propagates through the halo as more and more gas cools , with compton cooling the entire halo cools at the same rate . the amount of gas which can reach the centre of the halo is then controlled by the free - fall timescale in the halo .    including compton cooling in our model turns out to make little difference to the results .",
    "for example , the total mass of stars formed in the universe as a function of redshift differs by less than @xmath60 for @xmath61 between models with and without compton cooling . at higher redshifts the differences can become as large as 30% for small intervals of redshift .",
    "for example , if a massive halo cools via compton cooling it will rapidly produce many stars  without compton cooling it will still form these stars , but not until slightly later when collisional radiative cooling takes effect . however , the mass of stars formed at these high redshifts is tiny , and so any differences become entirely negligible at lower redshifts when many more stars have formed .",
    "although at high redshift the compton cooling time is shorter than the age of the universe , halos are merging at a high rate and so their gas is being repeatedly shock - heated by successive mergers which , we assume , heat the gas to the virial temperature of the halo . we find that for the majority of halos the time between successive major mergers ( defined as the time for a doubling in mass of the halo ) is less than the compton cooling time at the redshifts considered here",
    ". therefore , compton cooling will be ineffective in these halos .",
    "in the few cases where the halo does survive long enough that compton cooling could be important , we find that the collisional radiative cooling time at the virial radius of the halo is often shorter than the compton cooling time , in which case all of the gas in the halo will cool whether or not we include the effects of compton cooling .",
    "nevertheless , compton cooling is included in all models considered .    in this work we ignore cooling due to molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath62 ) .",
    "although molecular hydrogen allows cooling to occur in gas below @xmath59k , it is easily dissociated by photons from stars that form from the cooling gas .",
    "previous studies that have included cooling due to h@xmath62 typically find that it is completely dissociated at very high redshifts .",
    "for example , find that molecular hydrogen is fully dissociated by @xmath63 .",
    "objects formed by h@xmath62 cooling are therefore not expected to contribute significantly to the reionization of the igm .      at",
    "any given redshift , some fraction of the gas in the universe will have become collisionally ionized in dark matter halos and some fraction will have cooled to become part of a galaxy . within the context of our semi - analytic model , we define the igm as all gas which has _ not _ been collisionally ionized inside dark matter halos and which has _ not _ become part of a galaxy ( note that we are here only interested in ionization of hydrogen ) .",
    "it is this gas which must be photoionized if the gunn - peterson constraint is to be satisfied .",
    "the fraction of the total baryon content of the universe which is in the igm , @xmath64 , can be estimated by integrating over the mass function of dark matter halos , as follows @xmath65 - f_{\\rm galaxy}(z ) , \\label{eq : figm}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the mean mass of diffuse gas in halos of mass @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the fraction of hydrogen which is collisionally ionized at the halo virial temperature ( which we take from the calculations of ) , @xmath69 is the comoving number density of halos ( which we approximate by the press - schechter mass function ) , @xmath70 is the critical density of the universe at @xmath50 , and @xmath71 is the fraction of the total baryonic mass in the universe which has been incorporated into galaxies .",
    "the quantities @xmath72 and @xmath71 can be readily calculated from our model of galaxy formation .",
    "[ fig : figm ] shows the evolution of @xmath64 with redshift .",
    "the semi - analytic model provides the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each galaxy , from which we can determine the ionizing luminosity of that galaxy . summing the contributions from all galaxies in a given halo yields the total ionizing luminosity produced in that halo . , using the model of , demonstrated that a higher reionization redshift could be obtained if zero - metallicity stars were responsible for reionization , as these produce a greater number of ionizing photons than low ( i.e. @xmath73 ) metallicity stars . in our model",
    "the very first stars have zero metallicity , but as we include chemical evolution only a very small fraction of stars have metallicities below @xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of who argue that the epoch of metal - free star formation must end before @xmath74 , as the enhanced emission shortwards of 228  from such stars is inconsistent with observations of heii opacity in the igm at that redshift .",
    "therefore we can not appeal to such zero - metallicity stars to increase the redshift of reionization in our model .    as a result of absorption by neutral hydrogen close to the emitting stars and extinction caused by dust , only a small fraction of the ionizing radiation emitted by the stars escapes from each galaxy @xcite .",
    "we therefore estimate , within the context of the semi - analytic model , the fraction , , of ionizing photons which escape the galaxy to become available for the photoionization of the  in the igm .",

    "the abundances of sources of given luminosity rises sharply up to @xmath79 ( the exact position of the peak depending on luminosity ) as more and more dark matter halos form that are capable of hosting bright galaxies . after @xmath79 abundances quickly drop towards @xmath50 as the amount of gas available for star formation declines .",
    "the escape fractions in our model will be determined by the mass and radial scale length of the  gas in galactic disks .",

    ", some of the hydrogen in disks will be in the form of molecules ( h@xmath62 ) or ionized gas ( ) , so this over - estimates the  masses and column densities .",
    "a significant contribution to the ionizing luminosity comes from very low mass halos .",
    "we therefore ensure that we resolve all halos which have a virial temperature @xmath89k up to @xmath90 , i.e. all halos down to a mass of @xmath91 .",
    "below this temperature cooling becomes inefficient ( since we are ignoring cooling by molecular hydrogen , and the compton cooling from the residual free electrons left over after recombination ) and so galaxy formation ceases .    the requirement that @xmath91 halos be resolved sets an upper limit on the mass of halo that we can simulate due to computer memory limits , since the lower the mass of halo that is resolved , the more progenitors a halo of given mass will have",
    ". at @xmath50 , the most massive halos that we are able to simulate",
    "make a significant contribution to the total filling factor and ionizing luminosity .",
    "however , for @xmath92 the most massive halos simulated contribute only 1% of the total number of escaping ionizing photons , and this fraction drops extremely rapidly as we look to even higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , at the high redshifts ( @xmath93 ) we will be interested in , ignoring higher mass halos makes no significant difference to our results .",
    "we note that once any halo has begun to ionize the surrounding igm , it could potentially influence the process of galaxy formation in nearby halos .",
    "ionizing photons from the first halo will act to heat the gas in nearby halos , thereby reducing the effective cooling rate @xcite . since prior to full reionization each halo will see only the flux of ionizing photons from nearby sources , a detailed accounting of this radiative feedback requires a treatment of the radiative transfer of the ionizing radiation through the igm .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "such radiative feedback is expected to be very efficient at dissociating molecular hydrogen , with finding that h@xmath62 is completely dissociated by @xmath63 .",
    "radiative feedback will also inhibit galaxy formation both by reducing the amount of gas that accretes into low mass halos @xcite and by reducing the cooling rate of gas within halos .",
    "show that radiative feedback may be effective in inhibiting galaxy formation in halos with circular velocities of 50 km / s or less . in our model ,",
    "the ionizing luminosity becomes dominated by galaxies in halos with circular velocities greater than 50 km / s at redshifts below @xmath94 . at higher redshifts we may therefore be overestimating the total ionizing luminosity produced by galaxies , but this should not significantly affect the reionization redshift .",
    "gas and dust inside galaxies can readily absorb ionizing photons and re - emit the energy at longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore the amount and distribution of these components are the main factors that determine .",
    "the model of galaxy formation explicitly provides the mass and metallicity of cold gas present in each galaxy disk and the half - mass radius of that disk , all as functions of time .",
    "the mass of dust is assumed to be proportional to the mass of cold gas and to its metallicity .",
    "we split the escape fraction into contributions from gas , @xmath95 , and dust , @xmath96 , such that the total escaping fraction is given by @xmath97 .    describe in detail how the effects of dust are included in their model of galaxy formation .",
    "this modelling , which uses the calculations of , is much more realistic than has been previously included in semi - analytic galaxy formation models , as it includes a fully 3d ( though axisymmetric ) dust distribution , and the dust optical depths are calculated for each galaxy individually . in this model",
    ", stars are assumed to be distributed in a bulge and in an exponential disk with a vertical scale height equal to @xmath98 times the radial scale length ( this ratio was adopted by ferrara et al . to match the observed values for the old disk population of galaxies like the milky way ) .",
    "the dust is assumed to be distributed in the same way as the disk stars .",
    "the models give the attenuation of the ionizing radiation as a function of the inclination angle at which a galaxy is viewed , and we average this over angle to find the mean dust extinction for each galaxy .",
    "the dust attenuations do not include the effects of clumping of the stars or dust , and also assume that the ionizing stars have the same vertical distribution as the dust . with these two caveats in mind ,",
    "the dust extinctions we apply should only be considered as approximate .",
    "some of the emitted lyc photons are absorbed by neutral hydrogen close to the emitting star , thereby causing h@xmath80 line emission from the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath80 luminosity function is sensitive to the fraction , @xmath95 , of the ionizing photons which manage to escape through the gas .",
    "we will require our models to reproduce the observed h@xmath80 luminosity function and luminosity density .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : halphalf ] and [ fig : halphadens ] we compare the h@xmath80 emission line properties of galaxies in our model with observational data at low redshift .",
    "the observed values are already corrected for dust extinction , so we compare them with the theoretical values before dust attenuation . in order to calculate these properties accurately , we simulate halos of mass up to and including @xmath99 . in calculating the h@xmath80 line luminosity of each galaxy , we assume that a fraction @xmath100 of the lyc photons are absorbed by hydrogen atoms , producing h@xmath80 photons according to case b recombination . the remaining lyc photons escape , after being further attenuated by dust .",

    "both the predicted h@xmath80 luminosity function and luminosity density are in reasonable agreement with the observations , demonstrating that our models produce galaxies with realistic total ionizing luminosities ( before attenuation by gas and dust ) . in principle , these observational comparisons provide a constraint on the value of @xmath95 , if the other parameters in the semi - analytical model are assumed to be known .",
    "however , in practice it is not possible to reliably distinguish between @xmath102 and @xmath103 or @xmath104 , given the uncertainties in the observational data .",
    "the observational results depend on the dust correction factors applied , and there is also some uncertainty in the ionizing luminosities predicted by stellar population synthesis models for a given imf . with these caveats in mind",
    "it would seem that mean escape fractions anywhere between zero and 20 - 30% are acceptable .",
    "observations of starburst galaxies in the nearby universe suggest that the escape fraction is actually less than @xmath105 for such galaxies @xcite , but starbursts are known to have very high column densities of gas and dust , and so the escape fraction in normal galaxies can probably be significantly higher ( e.g. ) .",
    "so far , we have assumed that @xmath95 is a global constant , varying neither with galaxy properties nor redshift .",

    "this results in an escape fraction increasing with halo mass for the most massive halos simulated .",

    "all models show an initial rapid decline in @xmath0 with increasing @xmath118 .",
    "after this , in the constant @xmath95 model , the mean escape fraction increases with redshift since the dust content of galaxies was lower in the past . the ds94 model shows a very gradually rising escape fraction , whilst the dsgn98 model has a more rapid decline .    in our model , the contribution of stellar sources to the uv background is dominated by galaxies at low redshifts ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "we find that immediately shortwards of 912 our ds94 model predicts a background due to stellar sources which is very close to that expected from qsos @xcite , after including the effects of attenuation by the intervening igm @xcite . at shorter wavelengths the qso contribution soon becomes dominant .",

    "we ignore any dependence of the density profile of the gas in the halo on the fraction which has cooled to form galaxies .",

    ", we integrate the above expression over all halos more massive than @xmath145 , weighting by the volume for each halo . adding the contribution from the smooth component",

    "@xmath313 is averaged over all halos of mass @xmath67 in our model of galaxy formation .",
    "we determine @xmath145 by finding the mass of a dark matter halo which has a potential well deep enough that it can just hold onto reionized gas .",

    "in this paper , we concentrate on the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect which is induced by the peculiar motions ( deviations from pure hubble flow ) of free electrons in ionized regions @xcite . there exist other secondary sources of cmb anisotropies .",
    "however , on angular scales smaller than a few arc - minutes , the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect is likely to provide a dominant contribution .",
    "for example , it is known that the temperature anisotropies caused by non - linear growth of density perturbations , which are often referred to as the rees - sciama effect or integrated sachs - wolfe effect , are of order @xmath325 or less @xcite .",
    "these anisotropies depend on the the baryon bulk physical peculiar velocity , @xmath326 , and the number density of free electrons , @xmath327 . in our calculations of the anisotropies",

    "if the universe became instantaneously fully ionized after some redshift @xmath207 , the relation between the optical depth @xmath339 and @xmath207 is approximately obtained as @xmath340 .",
    "therefore , if the reionization takes place at @xmath341 , as is the case in our reionization model , then the damping factor can be neglected .    the usual procedure to obtain the angular correlation function of temperature anisotropies in eqn .",
    "( [ eq_sol ] ) is by means of limber s equation in fourier space ( see for example ) .",
