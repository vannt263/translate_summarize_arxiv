    "in the theory of ordinary linear differential equations on a complex domain , and in particular in the theory of fuchsian systems , an important characteristic of the equation is its configuration of singularities and the characteristic indices at these singular points .",
    "associated to this data is the notion of the monodromy representation of the equation . roughly speaking ,",
    "this representation describes how the fundamental solution matrix of the equation changes under analytic continuation along the closed paths around the singular points and it gives a significant insight into the global behavior of solutions of the equation .    the fruitful idea of deforming the equation by moving the location of critical points into different configurations , or by changing the characteristic indices , without changing its monodromy representation , goes back to b.  riemann , but the actual foundations of this theory of _ isomonodromic deformations _ in the fuchsian case",
    "were laid down in the works of r. fuchs @xcite , l. schlesinger @xcite , and r. garnier @xcite .",
    "an extension of the theory to the non - fuchsian case was done relatively recently in the series of papers by m.  jimbo , t.  miwa , and k.  ueno , @xcite . at present , the theory of isomonodromic deformations is a very active research field with deep connections to other areas such as the theory of integrable systems , classical theory of differential equations , and differential and algebraic geometry .    in this work we focus on the relationship between isomonodromic deformations and painlev equations .",
    "we need to distinguish between continuous and discrete isomonodromic deformations . in the continuous case",
    "we move the location of singular points and the resulting schlesinger _",
    "equations _ reduce to painlev - type nonlinear _ differential _ equations .",
    "on the other hand , if we deform the characteristic indices , the isomonodromy condition requires that the indices change by integral shifts , and so the resulting dynamic is discrete and is expressed in the form of _ difference _ equations called schlesinger _",
    "transformations_. similarly to the continuous case , these transformations reduce to discrete analogues of painlev - type equations and the study of this correspondence has been a major research topic in the field of discrete integrable systems over the last twenty years , @xcite .",
    "we need to remark here that schlesinger transformations correspond to _ difference _ painlev equations , but the other two types of _ discrete _ painlev equations , _",
    "@xmath2-difference _ and _ elliptic - difference _",
    "painlev equations can also be considered in a modification of this approach .",
    "discrete painlev equations share many properties with the differential painlev equations , e.g. , the existence of special solutions such as algebraic solutions or solutions that can be expressed in terms of special functions , affine weyl group symmetries , and the geometric classification of equations in terms of rational surfaces .",
    "however , while it is well - known how to write differential painlev equations in the hamiltonian form @xcite , the discrete hamiltonian structure for discrete painlev equations is at present missing .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study such discrete hamiltonian structure for schlesinger transformations . in particular , we present an explicit formula for the discrete hamiltonian function of an elementary schlesinger transformation expressed in the same coordinates as the hamiltonian function of the continuous schlesinger equations considered by jimbo , miwa , mri , and sato in @xcite . note that this explicit formula gives a convenient tool for computing schlesinger transformations and consequently for the derivation of discrete painlev equations , since the usual computation of a schlesinger transformation from the compatibility condition between the fuchsian equation and the deformation equation is often quite complicated .",
    "we also present two explicit examples of discrete painlev equation computed in this framework .",
    "the first example that we consider is an isomonodromic deformation of a two - dimensional fuchsian system with three finite singular points .",
    "a nice feature of this example is that it allows us to compare , in the same setting and using the same coordinates , continuous deformations that are described by the painlev - vi equation @xmath3 , and discrete deformations that are described by the difference painlev - v equation d-@xmath4 , which corresponds to the bcklund transformations of @xmath3 .",
    "recall that in terms of the surface of initial conditions d-@xmath4 is also denoted as d-@xmath5 . in the second example we consider a discrete painlev equation of the type d-@xmath6 that does not have a continuous painlev counterpart . in @xcite one of",
    "the authors posed a problem of representing this equation using schlesinger transformations of some fuchsian system . in @xcite p.",
    "boalch described the fuchsian system whose schlesinger transformations are described by d-@xmath7 without doing the explicit coordinate computation .",
    "also note that d.  arinkin and a.  borodin clarified the correspondence between d-@xmath7 and the _ difference _ fuchsian equation in @xcite .",
    "here we compute the d-@xmath7 example explicitly using the discrete hamiltonian and use it to illustrate some interesting features , as well as some difficulties , that occur when we study discrete painlev equations using this approach .",
    "the text is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly set up the context of the problem and describe in more details some of the main objects . in section  [ sec : schlesinger_transformations ] we derive the equations of the elementary schlesinger transformations and in section  [ sec : the_generating_function ] we show how to write them in the hamiltonian form .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] is dedicated to the d-@xmath5 and d-@xmath7 examples , and the final section is conclusions and discussion of the resul .    *",

    "we briefly outline the description of this space following @xcite .    first , given @xmath17 , we separate the data about locations of singular points @xmath18 ( that we think of as parameters of the dynamic ) and the residue matrices @xmath16 at those points .",
    "thus , we define @xmath19 to be the set of all fuchsian equations with possible singularities at the points @xmath18 .",
    "further , since schlesinger dynamic either preserves ( in the continuous case ) or shifts ( in the discrete case ) the eigenvalues of @xmath16 , we treat the eigenvalues as the parameters of the dynamic as well .",
    "thus , the appropriate phase space is a quotient of the fiber of the eigenvalue map by gauge transformations .",

    "the _ spectral type _",
    "@xmath25 of @xmath17 is then defined to be the collection of these partitions for all indices ( including @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 it can be used to classify fuchsian systems up to isomorphisms and the operations of addition and middle convolution introduced by n.  katz @xcite , as in the recent work by t.  oshima @xcite .

    "then we have an eigenvalue map @xmath44 from the set of reduced fuchsian equations to the set of characteristic indices , where @xmath45 is the subset of @xmath46 satisfying the _ fuchs relation _ ( or the trace condition ) @xmath47 with these definitions , given @xmath48 , the fiber of the eigenvalue map is @xmath49 .    we still need to take into account the global similarity transformations .",
    "it is convenient to do this in two steps .",

    "eigenvectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 , ( here we use the @xmath63 symbol to indicate a _ row_-vector ) . in the matrix form , omitting vectors with indices @xmath64 that are in the kernel of @xmath16 , we can write @xmath65 with @xmath66 defined by ( [ eq : theta - i ] ) .",
    "but this means that we have a decomposition @xmath67 provided that @xmath68 , where the last condition is related to the normalization ambiguity of the eigenvectors .",

    "since then it has been used by many other researchers studying isomonodromic deformations , most notably by j.  harnad , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "[ rem : transf ] there are two natural actions on the decomposition space @xmath78 .",
    "first , the group @xmath52 of global gauge transformations of the fuchsian system induces the following action .",
    "given @xmath79 , we have the action @xmath80 which translates into the action @xmath81 .",
    "we refer to such transformations as _",
    "similarity transformations_. it is often necessary to restrict this action to the subgroup @xmath51 preserving the form of @xmath50 .",
    "second , for any pair @xmath69 the pair @xmath82 determines the same matrix @xmath16 for @xmath83 .",
    "the condition @xmath84 restricts @xmath85 to the stabilizer subgroup @xmath86 of @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , when all @xmath33 are distinct , @xmath85 has to be a diagonal matrix .",
    "we refer to such transformations as _",
    "trivial transformations_. these two actions obviously commute with each other .",
    "we are now ready to give an alternative description of the space of accessory parameters @xmath88 . given the pair @xmath89 as in the previous section , let @xmath90    the following diagram illustrates the relationship between different spaces defined in these two sections :          consider now isomonodromic deformations of a fuchsian system .",
    "for the continuous case , the most interesting situation is when we take the deformation parameters to be locations of critical points .",
    "thus , we let @xmath91 ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) , and consider a family of fuchsian equations on the function @xmath93 , @xmath94 the compatibility conditions for these deformation equations are called _ schlesinger equations_. these are partial differential equations on the coefficient matrices @xmath95 and they have the form @xmath96 } { u_{i } - u_{j } } \\quad ( i\\neq j),\\qquad      \\frac { \\partial \\mathbf{a}_{i } } { \\partial u_{i } } = - \\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac { [ \\mathbf{a}_{i},\\mathbf{a}_{j } ] } { u_{i } - u_{j } } .\\ ] ]    in @xcite jimbo  _ et.al _ showed that schlesinger equations can be written as a hamiltonian system on the decomposition space @xmath78 , @xmath97 with the hamiltonian @xmath98 schlesinger equations admit reductions to painlev - type nonlinear differential equations , which remains valid on the level of the hamiltonians as well ; we review an example of @xmath3 in section  [ sec : examples ] . the main question that we consider is what happens to this picture in the _ discrete _ case .",
    "the discrete counterparts of schlesinger equations are schlesinger transformations .",
    "those are rational transformations preserving the singularity structure and the monodromy data of the fuchsian system ( [ eq : fuchs-1 ] ) , except for the integral shifts in the characteristic indices @xmath33 .",
    "the study of such transformations again goes back to schlesinger @xcite , and this and the more general case of irregular singular points was considered in great detail in @xcite .",
    "schlesinger transformations have the form @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a specially chosen rational matrix function called the _ multiplier _ of the transformation .",

    "we focus on the _ elementary _ schlesinger transformations that only change two of the characteristic indices by unit shifts , i.e. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . for the examples section",

    "one approach is to discretize the continuous dynamic preserving its integrability properties , see the recent encyclopedic book by y.  suris , @xcite , but it requires underlying continuous dynamical system .",
    "an alternative and more direct procedure is to develop a discrete version based on the variational principles . in this case , the lagrangian formalism is more natural , but it is possible to extend it to include the discrete version of the hamiltonian formalism as well .",
    "this approach has its origin in the optimal control theory ( see , e.g. , b.  jordan and e.  polak @xcite , and j.  cadzow @xcite ) and mechanics ( see e.g. , j.  logan @xcite and s.  maeda @xcite ) . in the theory of integrable systems",
    "it was first used in the foundational works by a.  veselov @xcite and a.  veselov and j.  moser @xcite .",
    "a lot of recent work in this field is motivated by the development of very effective _ symplectic integrators _ , see an excellent review paper by j.  marsden and m.  west @xcite ( and the references therein ) , as well as more recent works by s.  lall and m.  west @xcite and a.  bloch , m.  leok , and t.  oshawa @xcite that emphasize the hamiltonian aspects of the theory .",

    "in this section we consider , using our discrete hamiltonian framework , two explicit examples of discrete schlesinger transformations that can be reduced to discrete painlev equations .",
    "we also try to illustrate in this section the role played by the geometry of painlev equations in not only determining the type of the equation , but also in studying the relationship between different explicit forms of equations of the same type .",
    "recall that , according to the geometric theory of painlev equations developed in @xcite , both continuous and discrete painlev equations can be classified by the type of their space of initial conditions , introduced by okamoto @xcite in the continuous case .",
    "this space can be obtained by successively blowing up the projective plane @xmath272 at nine ( possibly infinitely - close ) points that lie on a unique ( possibly singular ) cubic curve . the type of the resulting surface @xmath273 is then given by the configurations of irreducible components @xmath274 of its _ unique _ anti - canonical divisor @xmath275 or , equivalently , by the root sub - lattice @xmath276 spanned by @xmath274 in the orthogonal complement @xmath277 of @xmath275 in the picard lattice @xmath278 .",
    "the orthogonal complement @xmath279 of @xmath276 in @xmath277 then corresponds to the symmetries of the equation  its weyl group acts as automorphisms , called the _ cremona transformations _ , of @xmath278 preserving @xmath280 and the translational part of the weyl group corresponds to discrete painlev equations .",
    "we also want to emphasise the following point , see also @xcite . given a discrete painlev equation , we can determine its type by constructing its space of initial conditions .",
    "however , there is no converse process , although there are some particularly nice forms ( that we call _ standard _ ) of equations of each type , see @xcite .",
    "further , there can be many _ non - equivalent equations _",
    "( i.e. , equations that can not be transformed into each other by some change of coordinates ) of the same type  such equations can correspond to different translation directions in the affine weyl group of symmetries of @xmath273 . and even when the two different equations are equivalent , finding the actual change of coordinates that will transform one equation into the other can be a very challenging problem . in each case , understanding the geometry and the blow - up structure of the space of initial conditions can be of great help in determining the relationship between two different equations of the same type , as we illustrate by the two explicit examples below .    for the first example , we consider the fuchsian equation of matrix size @xmath281 with @xmath282 finite poles and rank - one condition @xmath283 for the residue matrices at those poles .",
    "it is well - known that continuous isomonodromic deformations of this system are described by the classical continuous painlev equation @xmath3 , the type of the space of initial conditions is @xmath284 , and the discrete painlev v equation d-@xmath285 d-@xmath286 appears as bcklund transformations of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that an elementary schlesinger transformation of this system is described by d-@xmath4 , and we explicitly show that this is indeed the case .    the second example is a more interesting one . in @xcite one of the authors ( h.s . )",
    "posed a problem of writing down discrete painlev equations of type @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 as schlesinger transformations of some fuchsian equations .",
    "one difficulty here is that these equations do not correspond to any continuous painlev differential equations .",
    "this problem was solved theoretically by boalch in @xcite , where it was shown that the moduli spaces of monodromy groups of some fuchsian equations are analytically isomorphic to the spaces of initial conditions for these discrete painlev equations . in particular , boalch showed that the fuchsian system with matrix size @xmath290 with @xmath291 finite poles ( and so there are no continuous deformation parameters ) and rank - two residue matrices , @xmath292 , has as its symmetry the affine weyl group of type @xmath293 , and so the type of the corresponding surface is either @xmath294 ( for the _ multiplicative _ or",
    "_ @xmath2-difference _",
    "case ) or @xmath295 ( for the _ additive _ or _ difference _ case ) .",
    "since we consider the additive case , we expect that discrete schlesinger transformations of this system should have type d-@xmath296 .",
    "however , an elementary discrete schlesinger transformation , when written in coordinates , becomes very complicated and in fact it can not be reduced to a standard form of d-@xmath296 , as written in @xcite . using the geometry of the space of initial conditions",
    ", we see that this is an example of a situation when the standard form of the equation corresponds to a direction that is a combination of two different directions given by different elementary schlesinger transformations , and then we explicitly show how to combine them into a single schlesinger transformation that corresponds to the standard form of d-@xmath296 , this is a new result .",
    "the geometric approach that we use requires finding correspondences between the rational surfaces that appear as desingularizations of different coordinate forms of two difference equations of the same type .",
    "such correspondence gives us a blow - down structure that can then be used to find a change of coordinates that relates the two equations that we consider , see the recent preprint @xcite by a.  carstea and t.  takenawa for a more detailed introduction into this technique .",
    "for this example we consider a fuchsian system of the spectral type @xmath298 , i.e. , we have @xmath282 ( finite ) poles and the matrix size is @xmath281 . in view of assumption  [",
    "assume : rank - reduce ] , it is possible to make the rank of the residue matrices at the finite poles equal to one . further , using the mbius transformations on @xmath299 , we can map @xmath300 to @xmath301 .",
    "we put @xmath302 and from now on we use @xmath303 instead of the indices @xmath304 , so @xmath305 , etc . then @xmath306 and we have the following _ riemann scheme _ and the corresponding _",
    "fuchs relation _ : @xmath307    in the rank - one case there is no need for the second index , and so we put @xmath308 , @xmath309 .",
    "then the spectral decomposition is simply @xmath310 with @xmath311 .",
    "consider the elementary transformation @xmath312 , i.e. , @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "its multiplier matrix and the generating hamiltonian function are @xmath316    this function generates the following dynamic equations : @xmath317    to illustrate the general situation , we now show how to solve these equations to define a map from @xmath269 to @xmath270 in this relatively simple example .",
    "this map is defined up to trivial transformations and becomes unique once we specify some normalization condition .",
    "indeed , equation  ( [ eq : dpv - c1 ] ) implies that @xmath318 , where @xmath319 is some proportionality constant .",
    "thus , we can rewrite the multiplier matrix as @xmath320 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dpv - c0 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath321 , and so @xmath322 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : bc - generic ] ) .",
    "finally , expression for @xmath323 can either be obtained by a direct computation or , simpler , from the equation @xmath324 .",
    "we then substitute these expressions into equations ( [ eq : dpv - b1][eq : dpv - bt ] ) and simplify .",
    "the final map is given by the following set of equations ( with @xmath325 , @xmath326 , and @xmath319 arbitrary constants corresponding to trivial transformations ) : @xmath327    let us now look at the schlesinger dynamic on the space of accessory parameters .",
    "normalizing the eigenvectors @xmath328 and @xmath329 , we can write @xmath330 here @xmath331 and so @xmath332 and @xmath333 . the reason for introducing @xmath334 is to simplify the relations between parameters @xmath335 , @xmath336 , and @xmath337 that follow from the trace conditions and the equation @xmath338 .",
    "these relations , written in terms of @xmath335 , @xmath339 , and @xmath340 , are @xmath341 where the last equation also follows from ( [ eq : dpv - rel22 ] ) and the fuchs relation .",
    "thus , everything is parameterized by @xmath342 , @xmath343 , @xmath344 , and @xmath345 subject to one additional constraint @xmath346",
    ". one additional degree of freedom is related to the global gauge action by constant non - degenerate diagonal matrices that allows us to normalize one of the @xmath335s , but it is convenient to keep this freedom for computations .",
    "finally , note that the normalization parameter @xmath335 should be considered as a part of either @xmath328 or @xmath329 , where the actual choice depends on the context .",
    "same coordinates were used in @xcite to describe the isomonodromic dynamic in the continuous case and the reduction to @xmath3 . with",
    "@xmath335 attached to @xmath329 , the standard symplectic form on the decomposition space reduces as follows , see * proposition  4 * in @xcite for a more general statement : @xmath347 where we used ( [ eq : dpv - rel22 ] ) to eliminate @xmath348 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new symplectic coordinates @xmath349 and @xmath350 .",

    "unfortunately , such a reduction procedure does not work in the discrete case and we need to work directly with the evolution equations .",

    "it turns out that it is possible to separate the `` normalization '' dynamics of @xmath335 and the `` directional dynamics '' of @xmath339 and @xmath340 , the latter one is given by the _ painlev equations_.    equation ( [ eq : dpv - b1 ] ) becomes @xmath359 note that @xmath360 , and so @xmath361 , as it should be .",

    "it is possible to show that the remaining evolution equations do not give any additional information .",
    "let us now write everything in the symplectic coordinates @xmath370 and @xmath2 .",

    "<S> schlesinger transformations are algebraic transformations of a fuchsian system that preserve its monodromy representation and act on the characteristic indices of the system by integral shifts </S>",
    "<S> . one of the important reasons to study such transformations is the relationship between schlesinger transformations and discrete painlev equations ; this is also the main theme behind our work . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how to write an elementary schlesinger transformation as a discrete hamiltonian system w.r.t .  the standard symplectic structure on the space of fuchsian systems . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how schlesinger transformations reduce to discrete painlev equations by considering two explicit examples , d-@xmath0 ( or difference painlev v ) and d-@xmath1 . </S>"
