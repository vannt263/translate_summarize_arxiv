    "let @xmath2 be the _ mapping class group _ of a closed oriented surface @xmath3 of genus @xmath4 , that is the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath3 .",

    "the mapping class group acts on @xmath6 and the kernel of this action @xmath7 is called the _",
    "torelli subgroup _ of @xmath2 .",
    "the torelli subgroup plays an important role in a study of mapping class group ",
    "see for example chapter  8 of @xcite and references there .",
    "the torelli group is generated by two types of elements : by _ dehn twists _ @xmath8 about separating simple closed curves , and by _ bounding pair maps _",
    ", which are defined as products of dehn twists @xmath9 about disjoint and homologous simple closed curves @xcite .",
    "this generating set can be further simplified , for example it is known @xcite that if @xmath10 , then @xmath7 is generated by a finite number of bounding pair maps .    as for relations , much less is known .",
    "for example , the only relations we know between two elements of @xmath7 are obvious commutativity relations . hence c.  leininger and d.  margalit conjectured @xcite that any pair of elements of the torelli group either commute or generate a free group .",
    "in fact , they showed in @xcite that the pure braid group has such property .",
    "it is known @xcite that the leininger ",
    "margalit conjecture is true for dehn twists about separating simple closed curves , so the next natural question is if the conjecture is true for bounding pair maps .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that there is a large class of bounding pair maps which support the leininger ",
    "margalit conjecture  see theorem [ main : thm ] .",
    "following @xcite , we say that simple closed curve @xmath11 in @xmath3 is _ essential _ if it does not bound a disk .",
    "we say that @xmath12 is an _ essential subsurface _ of @xmath3 if @xmath12 is a closed connected subsurface of @xmath3 and each component of @xmath13 is essential in @xmath3 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is a _ bounding pair _ in @xmath3 , if @xmath11 and @xmath14 are two disjoint , homologous , and nonisotopic simple closed curves in @xmath3 .",

    "symmetry _ of the bounding pair @xmath0 .",

    "hence , if @xmath22 is any orientation reversing involution which interchange @xmath11 and @xmath14 , then @xmath23 is a symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , by the classical results of harnack @xcite and weichold @xcite , we know the full topological classification of such orientation reversing involutions ( symmetries ) of @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath21 has genus @xmath24 , then there are @xmath25 symmetries for which the complement @xmath26 of the set @xmath27 of fixed points of @xmath28 is disconnected ( so  called _ separating _ symmetries ) , and @xmath29 symmetries for which @xmath26 is connected ( so  called _ nonseparating _ symmetries ) . in order to explain their geometric interpretation , assume that @xmath21 is embedded in @xmath30 in a symmetric manner as shown in figure  [ r01 ] .     of a subsurface @xmath21.,scaledwidth=90.0%",

    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath36 consists of @xmath37 circles : @xmath38 .",

    "observe that since @xmath11 and @xmath14 bound a subsurface of @xmath3 , @xmath45 is always even .    using the analysis made in example [ ex:1 ] it is straightforward to construct interesting examples of symmetric bounding pairs @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "[ main : thm ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be symmetric bounding pairs in @xmath3 , and assume that @xmath44 .",

    "we can assume that @xmath55 since @xmath45 is even , then @xmath56 let @xmath57 be the canonical projection on the orbit space .",
    "since @xmath58 and @xmath59 are disjoint , @xmath59 is disjoint from the set of fixed points of @xmath28 , and @xmath28 is a bijection between the sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "would imply that @xmath78 is an one - sided circle ( since @xmath28 is orientation reversing ) .",

    "moreover , for each @xmath84 we can choose an orientation preserving lift @xmath85 of @xmath86 , which defines a section @xmath87 of the projection @xmath88 . hence @xmath89 and @xmath90 generate a free subgroup of @xmath91 .",
    "it remains to show that these two elements generate a free subgroup of @xmath92 . by theorem 4.1 of @xcite , the kernel of the inclusion @xmath93",
