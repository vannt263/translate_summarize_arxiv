    "over the course of the last six years , we have made radio observations of five recent supernovae ( sne ) , sn  2001gd ( type iib ; ngc  5033 ) , sn  2001em ( type iin ; ugc  11794 ) , sn  2002hh ( type ii ; ngc  6946 ) , sn  2004dj ( type iip ; ngc  2403 ) , and sn  2004et ( type iip ; ngc  6946 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present the radio light curves of these sne .",
    "the parameterized model fits of the data using the model presented by sramek et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and a discussion of these results can be found in the proceedings of stockdale et al .",
    "our models indicate that the type iib sne thicker and denser circumstellar medium ( csm ) than the type iip sne in our sample .",
    "this is illustrated by the light curves peaking at later times .",
    "this supports the idea that type iib sne are a transitional class to type ib / c sne which are thought to be binary massive star systems .",
    "our light curves also indicate a more complex interaction with the csm and the sn blastwave for the type iib sne , possibly resulting from a large , rapid mass loss of the progenitor star .",
    "the light curve of sn  2001em indicates that it is encountering a dense , thick csm which is in stark contrast to typical ib / c sne which are not usually strong radio emitters .",
    "further vla and vlbi studies may provide useful insight into this unusual sn .",
