    "later pauls @xcite constructed minimal surfaces in @xmath1 as limits of minimal surfaces in nil manifolds , the riemannian heisenberg groups .",
    "cheng , hwang and yang @xcite have studied the weak solutions of the minimal surface equation for @xmath0-graphs and have proven existence and uniqueness results .",

    "we would like also to mention the recently distributed notes by bigolin and serra cassano @xcite , where they obtain regularity properties of an @xmath3-regular surface from regularity properties of its horizontal unit normal .",
    "interesting examples of minimal surfaces which are not area - minimizing are obtained in @xcite .",

    "obviously the angle functions @xmath326 can be extended continuously and preserving the monotonicity , to an angle function @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is the straight line containing the halfline @xmath20 .",
    "the graph of @xmath325 restricted to @xmath309 coincides with the euclidean locally lipschitz area - minimizing surface @xmath329 , for @xmath330 , constructed in the previous section .",
    "so the examples in this section can be seen as pieces of the examples of the previous one patched together .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath331 is a graph which is locally lipschitz in euclidean sense : choose a disk @xmath242 .",
    "let @xmath12 , @xmath332 .",
    "assume first that @xmath333 intersects the halflines @xmath334 transversally at the points @xmath335 .",
    "then @xmath336 $ ] , @xmath337 , \\ldots , [ x_{n},p]$ ] are contained in wedges and hence @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the supremum of the lipschitz constants of @xmath340 restricted to @xmath55 .",
    "the general case is then obtained by approximating @xmath12 and @xmath26 by points in the condition of the assumption .    to prove that @xmath325 is area minimizing we first approximate @xmath29 by smooth angle functions @xmath341 with @xmath342 . in this way",
    "we obtain a calibrating vector field which is continuous along the vertical planes passing through @xmath22 by lemma  [ lem : nuh ] .",
    "this allows us to apply the calibration argument to prove the area - minimizing property of @xmath343 .",
    "let @xmath344 be a constant for all @xmath345 .",
    "then the subgraph of @xmath343 is a minimizing cone with center at @xmath31 .",
    "restricted to the interior of the wedges @xmath309 , the surface @xmath343 is @xmath15 .",
    "an easy computation shows that , taking @xmath346 in the construction of the first section , the riemannian normal to @xmath157 along the halflines @xmath347 , @xmath348 ( that make angle @xmath349 with the positive @xmath139-axis ) is given by @xmath350 this vector field is invariant by rotations around the vertical axis .",
    "hence in our construction , the normal vector field to @xmath343 is continuous .",
    "it is straightforward to show that it is locally lipschitz in euclidean sense .",
    "these examples are inspired by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  7.2 ) .",
    "we consider a halfline @xmath9 extending from the origin , and an angle function @xmath10 continuous and nonincreasing as a function of the distance to the origin .",
    "we consider the union of the halflines @xmath351 , @xmath352 extending from @xmath353 with angles @xmath354 , @xmath355 , respectively .",
    "we patch the area - minimizing surface defined by @xmath14 in the wedge delimited by the halflines @xmath356 , @xmath357 , with the plane @xmath32 . in this way we get an entire area - minimizing @xmath0-graph , with lipschitz regularity . in case",
    "the angle function @xmath14 is constant , we get an area - minimizing cone with center @xmath31 , which is defined by the equation @xmath358 this surface is composed of two smooth pieces patched together along the halflines @xmath359 .",
