    "the recent discovery of higgs - like particles at lhc activates many interesting research not only on phenomenology but also on the origin of higs particle@xcite . in the framework of standard model the masses of leptons and quarks are explained by higgs mechanism .",
    "but the question on how masses of hadrons are generated has not been satisfactorily answered yet@xcite .",
    "since the light quark masses are too small to explain the hadron mass , the proton mass , for example , it is believed that the masses of hadrons are generated dynamically in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "if we ignore quark masses , a very good approximation for the hadrons consisting of light quarks ) , qcd has no scale at the classical level , but a scale emerges at the quantum level in the form of trace anomaly , an explicit breaking of scale symmetry . on the other hand , the spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry(@xmath0sb ) gives rise to another important scale determined by the quark condensate , @xmath1 , which is supposed to generate most of the hadron masses .",
    "thus it is natural to ask whether the chiral symmetry breaking and the scale symmetry breaking ( ssb ) are linked to each other and if so , how intricately .",
    "the idea as to how @xmath0sb is tied to ssb has been discussed recently in connection to the discovery of higgs - like particles in lhc . in the technicolor scheme ,",
    "the _ explicit _ @xmath0sb in heavy quark sector triggers the spontaneous scale - symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , of which a nambu - goldstone boson is identified as a higgs - like particle .",
    "it turns out that , in this walking technicolor scheme@xcite , the phenomenology of goldston boson of ssb can be differentiated from higgs in the standard model in more detailed analysis of lhc data . and",
    "this development may shed new light on new mechanism of mass generation for hadrons .    in hadronic sector",
    ", the idea that the scale symmetry and chiral symmetry are tied to each other has been explored in the line of thought that the explicit breaking of scale symmetry due to the qcd anomaly triggers the spontaneous @xmath0sb @xcite .",
    "assuming that the qcd anomaly can be decomposed into two parts ,  hard \" and  soft , \" the explicit symmetry breaking due to the soft part can be treated as small enough so that there is an approximate scale symmetry at low energy scale",
    ". then the dilaton emerges as a nambu - goldstone boson as argued in the work of freund and nambu@xcite .",
    "we can construct a phenomenological lagrangian which implements the above idea by introducing dilaton field into the lagrangian of pions and vector mesons constructed under the hidden local gauge symmetry principle .",
    "one of the interesting consequences is the scaling of lagrangian parameters : masses and coupling constants are dialed by the change of vacuum expectation value of dilaton field , i.e. , br scaling@xcite .",
    "the possible forms of scaling laws have been explored in various contexts .",
    "one of them is the observation of a half - skyrmion phase when skyrmions are put on the lattice which can be implemented into a new scaling law giving a stiffer equation of state@xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of dilaton field is the dilaton limit , that leads to the condition that a particular combination of pions and dilaton lead to the linear sigma model giving rise to a nontrivial scaling behavior@xcite .    in section 2 ,",
    "the work of freund and nambu is briefly sketched to develop a model in which pions and dilaton are introduced to take care of spontaneous breaking of both chiral symmetry and approximate scale symmetry .",
    "we introduce the phenomenological lagrangian , denoted dhls , which implements the above idea by introducing dilaton field into the lagrangian constructed under the hidden local gauge symmetry principle@xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we elaborate on how a dilaton field can be applied to the entangled transformation of pions in nonlinear realization of @xmath0sb at lower scale such that the chiral symmetry is linearly realized in the form of linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "the summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the first example which demonstrates the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the scale symmetry and its physical application of the dilaton field is the freund - nambu model@xcite .",
    "it has two real scalar fields , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the potential v ( , ) = v_a + v_b,[fn]where v_a & = & f^2 ^2 ^2 ,   v_b = [ - ^4 - ] = ( g^2 ^ 2 -1)^2 [ fnsb ] .",
    "@xmath4 is scale invariant but @xmath5 includes scale symmetry breaking terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one can introduce the new field , @xmath0 , defined by = ( g^2 ^ 2 -1)/(2g),[chi ] of which the scale transformation = ( x + 2 ) + , [ gb ] manifests one of the characteristics of nambu - goldstone bosons . in terms of the condensate @xmath8 given by the minimum of the potential , @xmath9 , the masses take the form m^2 _",
    "= f^2_0 ^ 2 ,   m^2 _ = _ 0 ^ 2 .",
    "it should be noted that the mass of @xmath2 comes from the scale invariant term @xmath4 , so is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "thus it can have an arbitrary value .",
    "however @xmath11 depends on @xmath10 , going to zero linearly as @xmath12 .",
    "this is known to be a characteristic of an approximate spontaneously - broken scale symmetry@xcite .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian of linear sigma model with @xmath13 with a potential of the following form v ( ) =( tr ^ -v^2)^2 = ( ^2 + _ i ^2_i -v^2)^2 .",
    "[ vphi ] the scale invariance is broken due to nonvanishing @xmath14 .",
    "but it is also this term which breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously .",
    "when we assign the vacuum expectation only to @xmath15 , @xmath16 become nambu - goldstone bosons related to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and we call them pions , @xmath17 . for @xmath18 , there is no explicit breaking of scale symmetry regardless of the value of @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce a scalar field , @xmath0 , and reformulate the above potential in the following form , v ( , ) = ( tr ^ -^2)^2 + v ( ) [ vphichi ] the first term is analogous to @xmath4 in eq.([fnsb ] ) , which is scale invariant .",
    "the second term is to break scale symmetry . in general",
    ", @xmath19 gives nonvavinshing vacuum expectation value for @xmath0 , which can be of the following forms v_= ( ^2 - v^2)^2 ,   or   v_= ^4 .[vphichiln ] one can see that the scale symmetry breaking in eq.([vphi ] ) is transferred to the second term of eq.([vphichi ] ) , which plays a similar role as eq.([fnsb ] ) .",
    "if the scale symmetry breaking term with @xmath10 is small enough such that there is an _ approximate _ scale symmetry , then it can be considered as spontaneously broken and associate a nambu - goldstone boson of the form@xcite , = ( ^2 - v^2)/2v ,   or   & = & v e^/v .",
    "the origin of scale symmetry breaking in hadron physics can be traced back to the qcd trace anomaly and a dilaton field can be associated with the process",
    ". then eq.([vphichi ] ) reduces to eq.([vphi ] ) .",
    "it is now clear in this formulation that the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is not possible without scale symmetry breaking . or put differently , _ scale symmetry breaking is responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking_. this indicates one of the possible ways that the trace anomaly of qcd can be linked to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the chiral symmetry , which is broken spontaneously , can be realized non - linearly by introducing @xmath20 instead of four - component scalar fields , @xmath21 .",
    "the pions @xmath22 transform nonlinearly under the broken sector of chiral transformation , with the pions derivatively coupled .",
    "the lowest derivative term of pion dynamics ( namely the current algebra term ) can be written = . this term breaks scale symmetry explicitly because of the explicit scale @xmath23 .",
    "this scale can be traced back to the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field @xmath0 as in eq.([vphichi ] ) with @xmath24 and the scale symmetry breaking can be traded in the potential @xmath25 ( u , ) = + v ( ) + _ ^.    defining a new field u ( ) , [ linear ] we can see that ( u , ) ( ) = + v(^),[linear2 ] where we have used @xmath26 .",
    "if we can identify @xmath27 as = + i , then it is nothing but the linear sigma model .",
    "however it is not clear how the linear representation of nonlinear field can be achieved by adding a dilaton , which is chiral singlet . apart from the theoretical justification , we may expect this can be achieved physically in a certain limit , for example in baryonic matter with higher density .",
    "this is the issue that concerns the  dilaton limit \" discussed in@xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the dilaton limit leads to a very interesting consequence when nucleons are included in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the vector coupling constant is found to have a limiting value @xmath28 in the dilaton limit .",
    "this idea has been extended@xcite to the effective theory where dilaton is incorporated into the hidden local symmetry theory , where vector mesons are present as explicit degrees of freedom . in this section",
    "the results are briefly sketched .",
    "the dilaton field which is responsible for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry , thus generating pions , can be naturally included in the effective lagrangian at low baryon density .",
    "the redundant symmetry , i.e. , hidden local symmetry(hls ) , appearing in the formalism of nonlinear realization of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has been used to incorporate the vector mesons systematically . however",
    "the lagrangian of hls is , by construction , noninvariant under scale symmetry .",
    "the pattern of symmetry breaking is thus not consistent with the scale symmetry breaking due to qcd trace anomaly , which is believed to be the only reason why the effective theory of qcd should have scale symmetry breaking term modulo the light quark mass .",
    "the dilated hls is constructed such that all terms in the lagrangian are scale invariant except for the potential of dilaton , that reproduces the relevant scale symmetry breaking for qcd trace anomaly .",
    "one of the simplest ways to construct the dilated hls is to follow the standard trick of inserting the dilaton field @xmath0 as  conformal compensator \" into the lagrangian to obtain scale symmetric lagrangian , given by @xmath29q { } + g_{a}\\bar{q } \\rho_{3 } \\gamma^{\\mu}\\hat{\\alpha}_{\\perp \\mu } \\gamma_{5 } q\\ , , \\label{nchilargrangian } \\\\ { \\mathcal l}_m & = & \\frac{f_{\\pi}^2}{f_{\\chi}^2 } \\chi^2\\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\hat{\\alpha}_{\\perp\\mu }    \\hat{\\alpha}_{\\perp}^{\\mu } \\right ] { } + \\frac{f_{\\sigma\\rho}^2}{f_{\\chi}^2 } \\chi^2\\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\hat{\\alpha}_{\\parallel\\mu }    \\hat{\\alpha}_{\\parallel}^{\\mu } \\right ] { } + \\frac{f_{\\sigma\\omega}^2 - f_{\\sigma\\rho}^2}{2f_{\\chi}^2 } \\chi^2\\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\hat{\\alpha}_{\\parallel\\mu } \\right ]    \\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\hat{\\alpha}_{\\parallel}^{\\mu } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } - \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\rho_{\\mu\\nu}\\rho^{\\mu\\nu } \\right ] { } - \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\omega^{\\mu\\nu } \\right]\\ , ,   \\\\ { \\mathcal l}_\\chi & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu\\chi\\cdot\\partial^\\mu\\chi { } -v(\\chi ) \\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the dilaton potential that breaks scale symmetry spontaneously and @xmath30 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath0 at zero temperature and density .",
    "the detailed expressions needed in this section can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . as in the previous section ,",
    "we do the field re - parameterizations @xmath31 . and using the nonlinearly transforming nucleon field of parity eigenstates , one finds a complicated expression for ( [ dlfplag ] ) composed of a part that is regular , @xmath32 , and a part that is singular , @xmath33 , as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is iso - spin index .",
    "the singular part that arises solely from the scale invariant part of the original lagrangian ( [ dlfplag ] ) has the form @xmath36\\right ) + \\left ( \\alpha -1\\right ) { \\cal b } \\left ( 1/\\tr \\left [ \\sigma_s \\sigma_s^{\\dagger } \\right]\\right)\\ , , \\label{sing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see that the condition @xmath37 has been already used in getting eq.([linear2 ] ) .",
    "that @xmath38 be absent also leads to the condition that g_v - g_a0 .    using large @xmath39 sum - rule arguments  @xcite and the rge @xcite , we infer g_a-10 .",
    "it follows then that g_nn = g_(g_v-1)0 .",
    "this set of limits defines what is referred to as  dilaton limit . \"",
    "we thus find that in the dilaton limit , the @xmath40 meson decouples from the nucleon .",
    "in contrast , the limiting @xmath41 _ does not _ give any constraint on @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43-nucleon coupling remains non - vanishing in the lagrangian of fluctuations @xmath44 and @xmath45 around their expectation values , which in terms of the mass - diagonalizing field @xmath46 , takes the form , @xmath47 this is just the nucleon part of the linear sigma model in which the @xmath43 is minimally coupled to the nucleon .",
    "the origin of scale symmetry breaking in hadron physics can be traced back to the qcd trace anomaly , and it can be implemented into an effective theory by introducing a dilaton field .",
    "the idea that the scale symmetry and chiral symmetry are tied to each other has been explored in a line of thought that the explicit breaking of scale symmetry due to the qcd anomaly triggers the spontaneous @xmath0sb @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that using a model similar to that of freund - nambu the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is locked to the scale symmetry breaking through dilaton field .",
    "this provides one of the possible ways to relate the trace anomaly of qcd to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is possible to construct a phenomenological lagrangian@xcite that encapsulates the above idea by introducing dilaton field into the lagrangian of pions and vector mesons constructed under the hidden local gauge symmetry principle with parity doubled baryons .",
    "one of the interesting consequences is the scaling of parameters of the lagrangian : masses and coupling constants are dialed by the change of vacuum expectation value of dilaton field as in br scaling @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of dilaton field is the dilaton limit that gives the condition that a particular combination of pions and dilaton lead to the linear sigma model , giving rise to a nontrivial scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "most of the conventional effective actions constructed for low - density phenomena without dilaton available in the literature do not reveal the above feature . to realize the linear realization feature",
    ", the coupling constants should satisfy the particular condition .",
    "a highly non - trivial support for the dilaton limit properties comes from a renormalization group analysis of hidden local symmetry implemented with baryons@xcite .",
    "an intriguing consequence of the analysis is that the @xmath40 meson nucleon coupling vanishes at critical density corresponding to the dilaton limit _ before _ reaching chiral restoration .",
