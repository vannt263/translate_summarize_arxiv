    "part of the controversy surrounding non - cp maps in literature @xcite can be traced to ambiguities in the definitions of the extension maps . moreover",
    ", the presence of correlations may blur the boundary between the system and its environment .",
    "the main aim of this work is to introduce a class of non - cp maps that may be useful in the description of the dynamics of open systems correlated with the environment and to analyze some of their properties .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in the next section we provide a short review of some properties of positive linear maps .",
    "the notion of accessible maps is introduced in section  [ embeddings ] while their properties are investigated in section  [ properties ] .",
    "some implications for process tomography are presented in section  [ tomog ] and a few other applications of non - cp maps are discussed in section  [ other ] .",
    "in this section we recall several properties of linear maps on the set of density matrices . a linear , hermiticity - preserving transformation @xmath32 acting in the space of density matrices",
    "may be represented by the _",
    "dynamical ( choi ) matrix _",
    "@xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36 which has a number of useful properties @xcite .",
    "the trace preserving condition ( [ tp1 ] ) is equivalent to the following constraint on the partial trace of the dynamical matrix , @xmath37 which implies @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , if the map is unital , i.e. , it maps the maximally mixed state into the maximally mixed state , then @xmath39    the dynamical matrix is hermitian , @xmath40 and due to a theorem of choi @xcite its positivity is equivalent to the complete positivity of @xmath32 .",
    "this property follows from the eigen - decomposition of the choi matrix , @xmath41[eigend ] in which all the eigenvalues @xmath42 are non  negative .",
    "if the dynamical matrix @xmath43 is not positive we can split its spectrum into positive and negative parts .",
    "this step allows us to represent a linear non  cp map as the difference of two cp maps , called the _ difference form _",
    "@xcite , @xmath44[diff2maps ] where the maps @xmath45 are completely positive .",
    "completely positive maps have another important property : distinguishability of the set of states @xmath46 does not improve under any cp map @xcite . for example , the trace distance between two density matrices does not increase under any cp map @xmath47 @xmath48    despite its definition as a mathematical tool , some matrix elements of @xmath43 have a direct experimental significance .",
    "for example , by a narrow - band laser resonant transition @xmath49 in a nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond , the fluorescence intensity autocorrelation function @xmath50 is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the steady - state population of the fluorescent substate @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "a possibly non - linear and non - positive map @xmath32 that describes a state transformation on @xmath4 may be considered physically _ accessible _",
    "if @xmath54 , with the embedding described by some @xmath21 . the domain @xmath55 of @xmath32 should be a finite volume ( i.e. , non - empty ) subset of the set of all states of @xmath56 which we will call @xmath57 this is the first non - trivial requirement : physically relevant maps should be identifiable by process tomography , and convex combinations of a tomographically complete set of states must span a finite - volume region of @xmath57 in addition , a non - positive map @xmath32 may only be accessible for states in its domain of positivity , where @xmath58    however , this definition is still too broad ; some more restrictions on the assignment maps are essential . without these further conditions the definition of accessibility remains trivial : _ any _ map becomes accessible on its domain of positivity .",
    "for example , the positive non - cp transposition map @xmath59 , results from the extension @xmath60 followed by the swap gate , @xmath61 .",
    "an arbitrary non - linear map @xmath62 can be realized by @xmath63 and the unitary swap .",
    "it might be objected that this construction is rather contrived . however , when we are setting the dials of our preparation apparatus in order to produce our tomographically complete set of input states , we are giving that apparatus a complete , classical description of the state we would like it to produce .",
    "once we have done that , there is no _ a priori _ reason why the apparatus should not produce extra copies of the state , or ones that have undergone some peculiar map .",
    "there is another way of demonstrating this point that draws on quantum information about the tomographically complete set of input states instead of the classical description of the state invoked above .",
    "suppose instead that we are given that the environment consists of infinitely many copies of the state of the system ( in a tensor product ) .",
    "then the environment contains a complete ( i.e. , classical ) description of the state , and can be used to implement an arbitrary map .",
    "this can be seen by noting that we could use the copies in the environment to do exact state tomography and then proceed as above @xcite .",
    "there is also a direct equivalence between partial quantum information about a state ( in the form of finitely many duplicate copies of that state ) and incomplete or `` fuzzy '' classical descriptions of that state , via optimal state tomography .",
    "therefore we can implement any map that depends on detailed ( classical ) knowledge of the state provided we have access to an environment that contains a sufficiently large number of copies of that state .",
    "if the map requires knowledge of the state that is infinitely precise ( i.e. , in order to perform this map correctly , we must pick out a lower - dimensional subset of the set of density matrices ) then an infinite number of copies in the environment would be required .",
    "for example , if we know what @xmath29 is exactly , we can always perform the map @xmath64 by another route : find the unitary @xmath26 such that @xmath65 is diagonal , and then do @xmath66 however , this map depends on @xmath24 via @xmath67 and it requires exact knowledge of the eigenstates of @xmath68 there are also other ways of using multiple copies of a state to perform exotic maps on that state .    we can draw a number of conclusions from these observations :    \\(i ) if the ancilla system @xmath28 depends on @xmath24 a non - cp map may arise from a tensor product assignment ; ( ii ) the domain @xmath55 may be the entire set of states @xmath69 ( iii ) given enough copies of @xmath29 in the environment , any map can be performed @xcite .",
    "clearly realistic systems will not have environments that contain so much information about the state that point ( iii ) becomes a completely unmanageable problem , but how much information is it reasonable to assume the environment might have about the state ?",
    "the information known to the environment is part of the assignment map , thus our first task is to demarcate the set of physically reasonable assignment maps .",
    "we will begin by considering the simplest , `` linear '' case where the assignment map is linear ; i.e. , the marginal state of the environment @xmath28 is independent of @xmath29 and the correlations between system and environment can _ only _ be seen in the density matrix of the combined system @xmath70 we will then consider the slightly more general `` affine '' case , before discussing what approximations might be possible for the `` non - linear '' cases where @xmath28 is allowed to depend on @xmath29 directly .",
    "the simplest scenario is an initial value problem in which the time evolution of different initial states of the system is analyzed given that the initial state of the environment and the system - environment correlations are independent of @xmath68 if the initial bloch vector of the system is @xmath71 the @xmath72 could still depend on the @xmath73 if this is not the case ( i.e. , @xmath74 a constant ) then we can write @xmath75 where @xmath76 in general , @xmath77 may depend on @xmath29 as well as the @xmath78 but for the case when @xmath79 is a constant matrix , @xmath80 depends only on the @xmath78 via the second term in .    under the action of a unitary @xmath26 on the extended system , a useful form of the reduced dynamics of @xmath29 is obtained using the following procedure proposed by telmachovi and buek @xcite .",
    "decompose the extended density matrix @xmath19 into a simple tensor product and the remaining term , @xmath81 the direct product term yields a cp - map , as @xmath28 is independent of @xmath29 so this term is in stinespring form . using the spectral decomposition @xmath82 and writing the partial trace as @xmath83 where the @xmath84 form an orthonormal basis in @xmath85 and defining @xmath86 one obtains eq .",
    "after merging the double index @xmath87 into a single index , @xmath88 hence the _ affine form _ of @xmath89 is given @xcite by @xmath90\\nonumber \\\\   & = \\sum_{a } m_{a}\\rho m_{a}^\\dagger +   \\sum_{\\mu}\\sum_{i , j } \\frac{g_{ij}}{d_a d_b }    \\langle\\mu|u \\sigma^a_i\\otimes\\sigma^b_j u^\\dagger|\\mu\\rangle .",
    "\\label{introbuz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the assumption that the initial environmental marginal @xmath23 can not depend on the initial state @xmath91 is rather strong ; for realistic ( and poorly characterized ) systems , we should not rule out any functional dependence _ a priori , _ thus we should treat @xmath92 unless we have good reason to assume the system does , in fact , behave like the linear case .    as noted above ,",
    "if the environment has access to infinitely many copies of @xmath93 then any dynamical map can be induced on the system and the problem is intractable .",
    "however , that scenario is also rather unnatural .",
    "the question now becomes : can we make some physically well - motivated assumption about this system that will also make the problem tractable ?",
    "we will make the assumption that although the environment `` knows '' something about the state , it only knows a little information .",
    "we believe that this is a plausible assumption to make for physically reasonable systems and we will proceed with our analysis on that basis .    in practice the state @xmath19 may result from the evolution of @xmath94 under some ( imperfectly controlled ) unitary @xmath95 which acts on the combined system .",
    "this can be a more realistic description of scenarios such as a gate being applied to a qubit that was stored in an imperfect quantum memory than a simple cp map .",
    "when the desired gate is eventually applied , the target state @xmath29 is only an approximation to the intended state @xmath96 the dynamical matrix for the process @xmath97 is readily obtained as @xmath98 likewise , the evolution of the environment is described by a similar expression , with the environment s dynamical matrix depending on @xmath99 @xmath100    in generic cases @xmath43 describes a one - to - one mapping @xmath97 and therefore defines a unique transformation between the various coefficients .",
    "the values of the coefficients for the transformed matrix @xmath29 can be obtained by projection onto the original basis in the usual way : @xmath101 inverting the transformation in eq .   and using the dynamical matrix for the environment introduced in eq .",
    "above , we obtain the effective assignment map @xmath102 with @xmath103 with some constant coefficients @xmath104 and @xmath105 which are independent of the @xmath106 but do depend on @xmath107    if @xmath43 is not a one - to - one map , then @xmath29 does not determine @xmath28 uniquely . since all the relationships between the state parameters are linear , the effective assignment map in this case is given by @xmath108 which is actually the most general form of an affine assignment map , where the constants are subject to the positivity constraints , as before .",
    "an assignment map may also describe a preparation or be part of the specification of an imperfect quantum gate . in this case",
    "the correlation with the environment and/or its dependence on the state of the system are established either by design or accident , and the relations between @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath109 are potentially arbitrary . allowing an _ arbitrary _ assignment map ( even of the second degree ) results in declaring all maps physically accessible , in principle , including perfect cloning , in a similar way to the transpose example above : @xmath110 .",
    "of course , those examples do not exclude any functional forms of non - linear assignment maps .",
    "however , in practice the criteria for  reasonable \" restrictions are rather ad hoc : while it is quite clear that the completely unconstrained case that allows perfect cloning should be excluded , the feasibility of less outlandish assignment maps is determined by the details of the actual physical system and the preparation methods .",
    "we leave those cases ( like nmr @xcite or nv - centre qubits @xcite ) for a later study .",
    "we discuss a particularly important example in in section  [ tomog ] .",
    "our discussion of the assignment maps can be summarized by the following definition .",

    "their properties should be investigated in detail .",
    "another group of questions is related to following the reduced dynamics through time .",
    "a cp evolution forms a quantum dynamical semi - group and corresponds to a lindblad - type master equation @xcite .",
    "it is still an open question how a non - markovian evolution is linked to non - cp maps @xcite .",

    "<S> maps that are not completely positive ( cp ) are often useful to describe the dynamics of open systems . </S>",
    "<S> an apparent violation of complete positivity can occur because there are prior correlations of the principal system with the environment , or if the applied transformation is correlated with the state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a physically motivated definition of accessible non - cp maps and derive two necessary conditions for a map to be accessible . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that entanglement between the system and the environment is not necessary to generate a non - cp dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we describe two simple approximations that may be sufficient for some problems in process tomography , and then outline what these methods may be able to tell us in other situations where non - cp dynamics naturally arise . </S>"
