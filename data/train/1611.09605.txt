    "the contribution of the operator with dimension 2 to the @xmath0 data was studied later  @xcite and it was found to be compatible to zero with large errors .    our analysis is based on the use of adler function being a simple two - point correlator which is convenient to compare to experimental data .",

    "the main purpose is to verify whether the operator with dimension 2 exists .",
    "we limit ourselves by the data with isospin  @xmath13 , thereby avoiding strange particles , which are difficult to measure .",
    "while the data are presented as sets of experimental points , for accurate analysis it is preferable to obtain analytic fits of experimental data which are convenient to integrate .",
    "whereas there are different annihilation channels data obtained from different detectors , we fit every channel separately and find the formula for full cross - section .",

    "furthermore , by the form of regions corresponding our results  ( see fig .  [",

    "a rough estimation of this connection is expressed by formula : @xmath71     and gluon condensate at 1 , 2 and 3  @xmath65-level , determined by @xmath72 ( red ) , @xmath73 ( blue ) and @xmath74 ( yellow ) .",
