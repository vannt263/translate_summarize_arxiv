    "in free surface flow simulations based on the navier - stokes equations , it is often required to model an infinite domain while choosing the solution domain as small as possible in order to lower the computational effort . in such cases ,",
    "the elimination of wave reflections at the domain boundaries can be achieved by setting up a damping layer ( also called sponge layer , absorbing layer , damping zone , porous media layer ) , which is a zone next to the boundaries , in which source terms are added to the governing equations to damp the waves travelling through the zone .",
    "this paper discusses momentum source terms based on linear or quadratic damping functions as defined in sect .",
    "[ general ] . the amount and character of the damping",

    "section [ general ] shows how the existing implementations can be generalized .",
    "two of the most widely used implementations , the ones from cd - adapco star - ccm+ , based on choi and yoon ( 2009 ) , and ansys fluent , based on park et al .",

    "( 2011 ) .    the nomenclature from sect . [ implem ] is used throughout the work .",
    "for all simulations in this study , the damping function from choi and yoon ( 2009 ) is used , since it is rather generic and can be set up to act similar to the other approaches mentioned .",
    "thus the results are easily applicable to all damping approaches used in other cfd codes which can be generelized as described in sect .",
    "[ general ] .",
    "although widely used , much about the damping functions remains unknown at the time of writing .",
    "it has been observed that the coefficients in the damping functions are case - dependent .",
    "for example , the ansys fluent manual ( release @xmath0 ) states :  [ ... ] a default value of 10 was satisfactory , but this value is case specific and should be tuned to get better results with minimal reflection. in the above mentioned codes , these damping coefficients can be modified by the user .",
    "however , no guidelines seem to exist for this . thus in practice , either the default settings or values from experience are used as coefficients in the damping functions .",
    "if during or after the simulation it is observed that the damping does not work satisfactorily , then the damping coefficients are modified by trial and error and the simulation is restarted .",
    "this procedure is repeated until acceptable damping is obtained , a process which requires human interaction and can cost considerable additional time and computational effort . especially in the light of the increased automation of cfd computations , it would be preferable to be sure about the damping quality before the simulation . similar to wave damping in experiments , where according to lloyd ( 1989 ) seldom data on beach performance is published , also with cfd simulations",
    ", the performance of the wave damping is often not sufficiently accounted for . thus with most cfd publications , it is difficult to judge on the damping quality even if the damping setup is given .",
    "the aim of the present work is to clarify how the damping functions work , on which factors the damping quality depends and how reliable wave damping can be set up case - independently , so that no more fine - tuning of the damping coefficients is necessary .    in sect .",
    "[ general ] , the generalized forms of linear and quadratic damping functions are given . in the following sect .",
    "[ implem ] , the damping approach used in this work is described .",

    "furthermore , recommendations for selecting the damping coefficients are given .",
    "sections [ l2f1 ] to [ heightinfl ] investigate via 2d flow simulations how the damping quality and behavior is influenced by the choice of the coefficients in the damping functions , the thickness of the damping layer , the computational grid and the wave steepness . as the investigations so far have been mainly concerned with regular , monochromatic waves , recommendations for the damping for irregular waves are given in sect .",

    "[ l2f1 ] and [ l2f2 ] . commonly , the blending - in is realized in an exponential or quadratic fashion . the amount of damping is directly proportional to the fluid velocity .",

    "( [ lin ] ) weighted by the magnitude of the corresponding velocity component @xmath24 , so fluid particles with higher velocities experience disproportionately high damping .    in most cfd codes , @xmath21 and @xmath23 can be adjusted by the user .",
    "usually , but not necessarily , the momentum source terms are only applied to the equation for the vertical velocity component .",
    "a widely used approach is the one in choi and yoon ( 2009 ) , which is e.g. implemented in the commercial software code star - ccm+ by cd - adapco .",

    "thus for such cases , this damping approach can be modeled using eqs .",

    "thus in the following , only the approach by choi and yoon ( 2009 ) will be considered to study wave damping .",
    "it is obvious at this point that the findings in this work can easily be transferred to other damping approaches .",
    "from the analogy of the linearly damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) some characteristics about the damping can be deduced .",
    "the general formulation for a dho describes the damping of a harmonic oscillation over time : @xmath57 with oscillating quantity @xmath58 , time @xmath7 , oscillation frequency @xmath59 of the undamped system and damping ratio @xmath60 , which are defined as @xmath61 @xmath62 with spring constant @xmath63 , mass @xmath64 and damping constant @xmath65 .",
    "the damping ratio @xmath66 characterizes the damping behaviour of the system :    * @xmath67 : the system is not damped and oscillates with @xmath68 . * @xmath69 : the system is underdamped : it oscillates with diminishing amplitude and the lower frequency @xmath70 . * @xmath71 : the system is critically damped : it returns without oscillating as fast as possible to equilibrium . * @xmath72 : the system is overdamped : it returns without oscillating to equilibrium .",
    "the larger @xmath66 , the longer it takes for the system to reach equilibrium .",
    "the further @xmath66 deviates from @xmath73 , the longer the oscillation takes to decay , and the less effective the damping becomes .",
    "thus for a given oscillation frequency , there is only one set of coefficients @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 which provides optimal damping , i.e. @xmath71 . to obtain similar damping for different oscillation frequencies , these coefficients have to be adjusted to maintain the same value of @xmath60 .",
    "assume a mass free to oscillate connected to a spring and a linear damper so that the damping ratio is @xmath71 .",
    "if the system oscillation frequency @xmath59 is changed by changing the spring constant @xmath74 , then , to retain @xmath71 , the damper has to be changed to one with a damping constant @xmath76 according to eqs .",
    "( [ dho ] ) to ( [ zeta ] ) after the following law : @xmath77 thus the damping constant @xmath65 is directly proportional to the oscillation frequency @xmath78 when the mass @xmath75 is constant",
    ". a detailed description of the dho can be found in various textbooks , such as ghosh et al .",
    "( 2008 ) or jha ( 2005 ) .",
    "the characteristic behaviour for the dho suggests that similarities will exist in the behaviour for the linear damping of free surface waves .    in linear wave theory ,",
    "fluid particles in waves perform perfect orbital motions . via the orbital motion ,",
    "energy is constantly carried into the damping layer .",
    "the motion can be viewed as coupled transversal and longitudinal harmonic oscillation around a corresponding fixed center , so that damping of one oscillation also damps the other ) . however , if no such coupling exists ( as e.g. with pressure waves ) , then the momentum sinks have to be applied to the equation / s for momentum conservation in wave propagation direction . ] .",
    "the oscillation amplitude for each particle remains constant over time .",
    "the energy extraction in the damping layer results in a diminishing of amplitude over space .",
    "therefore all particle motions in the damping region can be considered to be similar , but with different oscillation amplitudes and phase shifts .",
    "the spatial decrease in wave energy can thus be interpreted like a temporal decrease in kinetic and spring energy of a dho , meaning that a damped harmonic oscillator could be constructed which provides the same decrease in energy as the wave energy in the damping layer . through this analogy",
    ", characteristics of the damped harmonic oscillator can be transferred to free surface wave damping approaches    thus for _ linear damping _ according to eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) : for two waves with same steepness but different wave frequency , to obtain similar damping , i.e. similar decrease in wave energy and amplitude , the thickness of the damping zone @xmath79 and the rest of the fade - in terms have to be scaled to be geometrically similar .",

    "( [ quad ] ) can be seen as velocity - weighted linear damping . if one ignores the fluctuating and @xmath53-dependent parts , particle velocity in waves depends linearly on wave frequency @xmath81 and wave height @xmath82 according to linear wave theory .",
    "assuming that , when changing the scale of the wave with constant steepness , the height is either accounted for in the scaling of @xmath79 or is not relevant , then damping coefficient @xmath83 has to be scaled directly proportional to the wave frequency squared .",
    "this hypothesis is investigated in sect .",
    "[ scalel2f2 ] .",
    "however , there is a difference which impedes the construction of a dho with a completely similar behavior as wave damping : in contrast to the dho , for which the damping withdraws energy from a _ single oscillator _ _ over time _ , the fluid particles in free surface waves can be seen as a _ large number of harmonic oscillators _ , for which the damping diminishes the oscillations _ over space_. whereas no reflections back in time are possible , in space waves can be reflected not only at the domain boundary , to which the damping zone is attached , but also at the entrance to the damping zone as described in sect .",

    "variations of the setup are mentioned where they occur .",
    "when wave reflections occur within a damping zone , then the waves will be partly reflected , i.e. they will propagate back into the solution domain with a diminished height . due to the resulting superposition of the partly reflected wave and the original wave ,",

    "this phenomenon is called a _ partial standing wave _ , since the more the damping deviates from the optimal value , the more does the phenomenon resemble a standing wave , until for the bounding cases ( i.e. zero damping or infinitely large damping ) there is @xmath103 reflection , and a standing wave occurs .    assessing the amount of reflections for regular monochromatic waves is an intricate issue . since only a single wave period occurs , a wave spectrum can not be constructed .",
    "thus from the recordings of a single wave probe , the height of the reflected wave can not be determined .",
    "however , the surface elevation in close vicinity to the boundary to which the damping zone is attached shows how much of the incident wave reaches the domain boundary despite the damping , since a maximum amplification occurs at the domain boundary when the wave is reflected .",
