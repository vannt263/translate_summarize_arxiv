    "the nuclear symmetry energy reflects the energy cost in converting the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter to the symmetric one . conventionally , as part of global mass formulas in the framework of the liquid - drop model ( @xmath0 ignoring pairing and shell - corrections ) , the symmetry energy @xmath1 of an even - even or odd - odd finite nucleus with @xmath2 neutrons and @xmath3 protons is given from the expression @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the energy of the nucleus barring the coulomb part , and @xmath7 is the symmetry energy coefficient . for infinite nuclear systems ,",

    "calculations have been done with two effective interactions , namely , the skm@xmath17 and the sbm . the subtraction procedure has been employed for modeling the hot nucleus .",
    "effects of the coupling of the surface phonons to the intrinsic particle motion have been taken into account through a phenomenological parametric form of the nucleon @xmath114-mass .",
    "the @xmath114-mass increases the nucleon effective mass at relatively low temperatures , this has an appreciable effect on the symmetry coefficients which decrease noticeably once effects due to @xmath172 are taken into account .",
    "questions may arise about the proper definition of the symmetry coefficients for finite nuclei .",
    "we have taken two definitions , one derived from the usual difference method @xcite , another from the local density approximation ( lda ) . in both approaches ,",
    "we find that @xmath8 decreases with temperature , @xmath144 shows the opposite trend . in the lda , the fall in @xmath8 is slow , in the difference method , this fall with temperature is much stronger . in this method ,",
    "the results , however , depend sensitively on the choice of the nuclear pairs taken to evaluate the symmetry energies .",
    "occasionally , the symmetry coefficients may even be negative , this is violative of the general concept of the symmetry coefficients .",
    "the ambiguities arising from the different definitions for symmetry coefficients of finite nuclear systems may possibly be overcome by calculating the ground state energies of a host of nuclei over the periodic table with a suitable choice of interaction in a microscopic framework , such as hartree - fock ( hf ) and then finding the mass parameters @xmath173 _ etc .",
    "_ in the spirit of the liquid - drop model .",
    "the calculations can be extended to various temperatures employing finite temperature hf method and then find the temperature dependence of the mass parameters which is likely to give ambiguity - free temperature dependence of the symmetry coefficients .",
    "this is , however , an ambitious program and the work is in progress ."
