    "the consideration of exotic dark matter has become necessary in order to close the universe @xcite@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore in in order to understand the large scale structure of the universe one has to consider matter made up of particles which were non - relativistic at the time of freeze out , i.e cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",

    "since the non exotic component can not exceed @xmath7 of the cdm  @xcite@xmath0  @xcite , there is room for the exotic wimp s ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .",
    "in fact the dama experiment  @xcite has claimed the observation of one signal in direct detection of a wimp , which with better statistics has subsequently been interpreted as a modulation signal  @xcite .",
    "the above developments are in line with particle physics considerations .",
    "thus , in the currently favored supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model , the most natural wimp candidate is the lsp , i.e. the lightest supersymmetric particle . in the most favored scenarios the lsp can be simply described as a majorana fermion , a linear combination of the neutral components of the gauginos and higgsinos @xcite@xmath0  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "since this particle is expected to be very massive , @xmath9 , and extremely non relativistic with average kinetic energy @xmath10 , it can be directly detected  @xcite@xmath8@xcite mainly via the recoiling of a nucleus ( a , z ) in the elastic scattering process : @xmath11 ( @xmath12 denotes the lsp ) . in order to compute the event rate",

    "the factor of @xmath43 is introduced , since we have chosen to normalize our results to the usual differential rate .",
    "we have seen that the event rate for lsp - nucleus scattering depends on the relative lsp - target velocity . in this section",
    "we will examine the consequences of the earth s revolution around the sun ( the effect of its rotation around its axis is expected to be negligible ) i.e. the modulation effect . in practice",
    "this has been accomplished by assuming a consistent lsp velocity dispersion , such as a maxwell distribution  @xcite or its extensions with only axial symmetry  @xcite , already been discussed in the lierature @xcite .",

    "we caution the reader that these axes are traditionally indicated by astronomers as @xmath50 respectively .",

    "the rate will merely be suppressed by a factor of @xmath62 relative to the non - directional rate .",

    "we only like to stress that it is a common practice to extract the lsp nucleon cross section from the the expected experimental event rates in order to compare with the susy predictions as a function of the lsp mass .",
    "we will again examine the case of caustic rings and the isothermal models considered above .",

    "we have studied the parameters describing the event rates for direct detection of susy dark matter and , in particular , two characteristic signatures , which will aid the experimentalists in reducing background : the non directional modulated event rates , which are correlated with the motion of the earth and the directional event rates , which are correlated with both the velocity of the sun and the velocity of the earth .    in the case of non isothermal models @xcite from table 1 we see that the maximun no longer occurs around june 2nd , but about six months later . the difference between the maximum and the minimum is about @xmath101 , smaller than that predicted by the symmetric isothermal models @xcite . in the case of the directional rate we found that the rates depend on the direction of observation .",
    "the biggest rates are obtained , if the observation is made close to the direction of the sun s motion .",
    "the directional rates are suppressed compared to the usual non - directional rates by the factor @xmath102 .",
    "we find that @xmath103 , if the observation is made in the sun s direction of motion , while @xmath104 in the opposite direction .",
    "the modulation is a bit larger than in the non - directional case , but the largest value , @xmath105 , is not obtainrd along the sun s direction of motion , but in the x - direction ( galactocentric direction ) .    in the case of the isothermal models we restricted our discussion to the directional event rates .",
    "the reduction factor is now given by the parameter @xmath106 .",
    "we find that @xmath107 is around 0.6 for no asymmetry and around 0.7 for maximum asymmetry ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "in other words it is not very different from the naively expected @xmath109 .",
    "the modulation of the directional rate increases with the asymmetry parameter @xmath110 and it depends , of course , on the direction of observation . for @xmath111 it can reach values up to @xmath112 .",
    "larger values , up to @xmath113 , are possible for large values of @xmath98 , but they occur at the expense of the total number of counts .    in all cases our results indicate that @xmath78 for large reduced mass deviates from unity .",
    "thus , if one attempts to extract the lsp - nucleon cross section from the data to compare it with the predictions of susy models , one must take @xmath78 into account .",

    "<S> the direct detection of dark matter is central to particle physics and cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . </S>",
    "<S> such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark substructure of the nucleon and the structure of the nucleus ( form factor and/or spin response function ) , permit the evaluation of the event rate for lsp - nucleus elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the thus obtained event rates are , however , very low or even undetectable . </S>",
    "<S> so it is imperative to exploit characteristic signatures , like the modulation effect , i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth s annual motion , and the directional rate , i.e its dependence on the direction of the recoiling nucleus . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we do this using various velocity distributions , isothermal ( symmetric as well as only axially asymmetric ) and non isothermal ( e.g. due to caustic rings ) . </S>"
