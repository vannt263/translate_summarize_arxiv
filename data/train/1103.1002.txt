    "observations reveal many evidences of unusual processes occurring in the region of gc . for instance , the enigmatic 511 kev annihilation emission discovered by integral ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recent analysis of fermi lat data ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) discovered a new evidence of the gc activity .",
    "they found two giant features of gamma - ray emission in the range 1 -100 gev , extending 50 degrees ( @xmath4 kpc ) above and below the galactic center - the fermi bubble ( fb ) .",
    "they presented a list of mechanisms that may contribute to the energy release and particle production necessary to explain the gamma - ray emission from the bubble .",
    "they noticed , however , that most likely the fermi bubble structure was created by some large episode of energy injection in the gc , such as a past accretion event onto the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the last @xmath4 myr .",
    "they cast doubt on the idea that the fermi bubble was generated by previous starburst activity in the gc because there was no evidence of massive supernova explosions ( @xmath11 ) in the past @xmath12 yr towards the gc . besides , these supernova remnants should be traced by the line emission of radioactive @xmath13al .",
    "observations do not show significant concentration of @xmath13al line towards the gc @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the procedure used by @xcite did not remove contributions of cr interaction with an ionised gas , then gamma - rays could be produced by protons interaction with the fully ionised plasma in the halo .",
    "@xcite also argued that the lifetime of these protons can be very long because the plasma is extremely turbulent in this region therefore protons could be trapped there for a time scale @xmath14 yr , then the observed gamma - rays can be explained with the injected power of sn @xmath15 erg s@xmath2 .    in this letter",
    "we propose that the fb emission may result from star capture processes , which have been developed by @xcite and @xcite to explain a wide range of x - ray and gamma - ray emission phenomena from the gc .",
    "the procedure of separation of the bubble emission from the total diffuse emission of the galaxy is described in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the bubble structure is seen when components of gamma - ray emission produced by cosmic ray ( cr ) interaction with the background gas , i.e. by cr protons ( @xmath16 decay ) and electrons ( bremsstrahlung ) are removed .",
    "@xcite concluded the the bubble emission was of the inverse compton ( ic ) origin generated by relativistic electrons .",
    "here we summarize the multi - wavelength observational constraints of the fb :    * the spectral shape and intensity of gamma - rays are almost constant over the bubble region that suggests a uniform production of gamma - rays in the fb .",
    "the total gamma - ray flux from the bubble at energies @xmath17 gev is @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 and the photon spectrum of gamma - rays is power - law , @xmath19 for the range 1 - 100 gev ( @xcite ) ; * in the radio range the bubble is seen from the tens ghz wmap data as a microwave residual spherical excess _",
    "( `` the microwave haze '' ) _ above the gc @xmath20 kpc in radius @xcite .",
    "its power spectrum in the frequency range 23 - 33 ghz is described as power - law , @xmath21 . for the magnetic field strength @xmath22",
    "g the energy range of electrons responsible for emitting these radio waves is within the range 20 - 30 gev and their spectrum is @xmath23 ; * the rosat 1.5 kev x - ray data clearly showed the characteristic of a bipolar structure @xcite that aligned well with the edges of the fermi bubble .",
    "the rosat structure is explained as due to a fast wind which drove a shock into the halo gas with the velocity @xmath24 cm s@xmath2 .",
    "this phenomenon requires an energy release of about @xmath25 ergs at the gc and this activity should be periodic on a timescale of @xmath26 myr . * the similarities of the morphology of the radio ,",
    "x - ray and gamma - ray structures strongly suggest their common origin .    in the case of electron ( leptonic ) model of @xcite gamma - rays",
    "are produced by scattering of relativistic electrons on background soft photons , i.e. relic , ir and optical photons from the disk .",
    "in this section we present our ideas about the origin of the fermi bubble in the framework of star capture by the central smbh .",
    "the process of gamma - ray emission from the bubble is determined by a number of stages of energy transformation .",
    "each of these stages actually involves complicated physical processes .",
    "the exact details of these processes are still not understood very well .",
    "nevertheless , their qualitative features do not depend on these details . in the following",
    ", we only briefly describe these processes and give their qualitative interpretations .",
    "we begin to describe processes of star capture by the central black hole as presented in @xcite .      as observations show",
    ", there is a supermassive black hole ( sgr a@xmath10 ) in the center of our galaxy with a mass of @xmath27 .",
    "a total tidal disruption of a star occurs when the penetration parameter @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ratio of the periapse distance @xmath30 to the tidal radius @xmath31 .",
    "the tidal disruption rate @xmath32 can be approximated to within an order of magnitude @xmath33  yr@xmath2 ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "the energy budget of a tidal disruption event follows from analysis of star matter dynamics .",
    "initially about 50% of the stellar mass becomes tightly bound to the black hole , while the remainder 50% of the stellar mass is forcefully ejected ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the kinetic energy carried by the ejected debris is a function of the penetration parameter @xmath34 and can significantly exceed that released by a normal supernova ( @xmath35  erg ) if the orbit is highly penetrating @xcite , @xmath36 thus , the mean kinetic energy per escaping nucleon is estimated as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mass of escaping material . from @xmath39 and @xmath32 we obtain that the average power in the form of a flux of subrelativistic protons . if @xmath40 erg and @xmath41 yr@xmath2 , we get @xmath42 erg s@xmath2 .    in @xcite we described the injection spectrum of protons generated by processes of star capture as monoenergetic .",
    "this is a simplification of the injection process because a stream of charged particles should be influenced by different plasma instabilities , as it was shown by @xcite for the case of relativistic jets . at first",
    "the jet material is moved by inertia .",
    "then due to the excitation of plasma instabilties in the flux , the particle distribution functions , which were initially delta functions both in angle and in energy , transforms into complex angular and energy dependencies .",
    "subrelativistic protons lose their energy mainly by coulomb collisions , i.e. @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the proton velocity , and @xmath45 is the coulomb logarithm . in this way",
    "the protons transfer almost all their energy to the background plasma and heat it .",
    "this process was analysed in @xcite . for the gc parameters the average time of coulomb losses for several tens mev protons",
    "is several million years .",
    "the radius of plasma heated by the protons is estimated from the diffusion equation describing propagation and energy losses of protons in the gc @xcite .",
    "this radius is about 100 pc .",
    "the temperature of heated plasma is determined by the energy which these protons transfer to the background gas . for @xmath46erg",
    "s@xmath2 the plasma temperature is about 10 kev @xcite just as observed by suzaku for the gc .",
    "the plasma with such a high temperature can not be confined at the gc and therefore it expands into the surrounding medium .",
    "hydrodynamics of gas expansion was described in many monographs and reviews ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as the time of star capture may be smaller than the time of proton energy losses , we have almost stationary energy release in the central region with a power @xmath47 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this situation is very similar to that described by @xcite for a stellar wind expanding into a uniform density medium .",
    "the model describes a star at time t=0 begins to blow a spherically symmetric wind with a velocity of stellar wind @xmath48 , mass - loss rate @xmath49 , and a luminosity @xmath50 which is analogous to the power @xmath51 produced by star capture processes .",
    "most of the time of the evolution is occupied by the so - called snowplow phase when a thin shock front is propagating through the medium .",
    "the shock is expanding as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a constant of order of unity .",
    "the velocity distribution inside the expanding region @xmath55 is nonuniform .",
    "our extrapolation of this hydrodynamic solution onto the fermi bubble is , of course , rather rough .",
    "first , the gas distribution in the halo is nonuniform .",
    "second , the analysis does not take into account particle acceleration by the shock .",
    "a significant fraction of the shock energy is spent on acceleration that modify the shock structure .",
    "nevertheless , this model presents a qualitative picture of a shock in the halo .",
    "the theory of particle acceleration by shock is described in many publications .",
    "this theory has been developed , and bulky numerical calculations have beeen performed to calculate spectra of particles accelerated by supernova ( sn ) shocks and emission produced by accelerated electrons and protons in the range from radio up to tev gamma - rays ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless many aspects of these processes are still unclear . for instance , the ratio of electrons to protons accelerated by shocks is not reliably estimated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we notice that the energy of shock front expected in the gc is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that of the energy released in a sn explosion .",
    "therefore , process of particle acceleration in terms of sizes of envelope , number of accelerated particles , maximum energy of accelerated particles , etc . may differ significantly from those obtained for sns .",
    "below we present simple estimations of electron acceleration by shocks .",
    "the injection spectrum of electrons accelerated in shocks is power - law , @xmath56 , and the maximum energy of accelerated electrons can be estimated from a kinetic equation describing their spectrum at the shock @xcite , @xmath57 , where @xmath24cm / s is the velocity of shock front , @xmath58 is the diffusion coefficient at the shock front and the energy losses of electrons ( synchrotron and ic ) are : @xmath59 .",
    "recall @xmath60 is a function of the magnetic and background radiation energy densities , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is thompson cross section and @xmath63 is the combined energy density of background photons @xmath64 and the magnetic energy density @xmath65 respectively .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the diffusion coefficient near the shock . for qualitative estimation",
    ", we can use the bohm diffusion ( @xmath66c ) , where @xmath67 is the larmor radius of electrons .",
    "using the typical values of these parameters , we obtain @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath70cm / s , @xmath71 is the magnetic field in the shock in units of @xmath72 g and @xmath73 is the energy density in units of 10@xmath74erg/@xmath75 .",
    "the spectrum of electrons in the bubble is modified by processes of energy losses and escape .",
    "it can be derived from the kinetic equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 describes the inverse compton , synchrotron and adiabatic ( because of wind velocity variations ) energy losses , @xmath78 is the time of particle escape from the bubble , and @xmath79 describes particles injection spectrum in the bubble .",
    "as one can see , in general case the spectrum of electrons in the bubble can not be described by a single power - law as assumed by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of electrons has a break at the energy @xmath80 where @xmath78 is the characteristic time of either particle escape from the bubble or of the adiabatic losses , e.g. for @xmath81 the break position follows from @xmath82 . by solving equation 3",
    ", we can see that the electron spectrum can not be described by a single power - law even in case of power - law injection ( see eg .",
    "berezinskii et al . , 1990 ) .",
    "the distribution of background photons can be derived from galprop program .",
    "the average energy density of background photons in the halo are @xmath83 ev @xmath84 for optical and @xmath85 ev @xmath84 for ir .",
    "these background soft photon energy densities are obviously not negligible in comparing with @xmath86 ev @xmath84 for the relic photons and also comparable with the magnetic energy density ( @xmath87 ) . the expected ic energy flux of gamma - rays and synchrotron radiation emitted from the same population of electrons described above are shown in fig .",
    "[ emission ] for different values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the klein - nishina ic cross - section @xcite is used .",
    "the observed spectrum of radioemission in the range 5 - 200ghz and gamma - rays are taken from @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the inverse compton gamma ray spectrum is formed by scattering on three different components of the background photons . when these three components are combined ( see fig .",
    "[ emission]b ) , they mimic a photon spectrum @xmath90 and describe well the data shown in fig . 23 of @xcite .",
    "we want to remark that although a single power law with the spectral indexes in between 1.8 and 2.4 in the energy range of electrons from 0.1 to 1000 gev can also explain both the fermi data as well as the radio data as suggested by su et al .",
    "theoretically a more complicated electron spectrum will be developed when the cooling time scale is comparable with the escape time even electrons are injected with a single power law as shown in equation 3 .      in our model",
    "there is 10kev hot plasma with power @xmath91erg / s injected into bubbles .",
    "part of these energies are used to accelerate the charged particles in the shock but a good fraction of energy will be used to heat up the gas in the halo due to coulomb collisions .",
    "the temperature of halo gas can be estimate as @xmath92 which gives @xmath93kev .",
    "the thermal radiation power from the heated halo gas is simply given by @xmath94erg/@xmath75 @xcite . by using kt=1.5kev , @xmath95 and z=1",
    ", we find @xmath96erg / s .",
    "the observed giant structure of fb is difficult to be explained by other processes .",
    "we suggest that periodic star capture processes by the central smbh can inject @xmath97erg / s hot plasma into the galactic halo .",
    "the hot gas can expand hydrodynamically and form shock to accelerate electrons to relativistic speed .",
    "synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering with the background soft photons produce the observed radio and gamma - rays respectively .",
    "acceleration of protons by the same shock may contribute to ultra - high energy cosmic rays , which will be considered in future works .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the mean free path of tev electrons @xmath98pc , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the diffusion coefficient and cooling time for tev electrons in units of @xmath101 and @xmath102yrs respectively . this estimated mean free path is much shorter than the size of the bubble . in our model",
    "the capture time is once every @xmath103yr , we expect that there is about nearly 100 captures in 3 million years .",
    "each of these captures can produce an individual shock front , therefore the gamma - ray radiation can be emitted uniformly over the entire bubble .",
    "furthermore we can estimate the shape of the bubble , if we simplify the geometry of our model as follows .",
    "after each capture a disk - like hot gas will be ejected from the gc . since the gas pressure in the halo ( @xmath104erg/@xmath75 ) is low and decreases quadratically for distance larger than 6kpc(paczynski 1990 ) , we can assume that the hot gas can escape freely vertically , which is defined as the z - direction and hence the z - component of the wind velocity @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "the ejected disk has a thickness @xmath107 , where @xmath108yr is the capture time scale .",
    "on the other hand the hot gas can also expand laterally and its radius along the direction of the galactic disk is given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110(cf .",
    "section 3.2 ) .",
    "when the expansion speed is supersonic then shock front can be formed at the edge of the ejected disk . in the vertical co - moving frame of the ejected disk the energy of the disk is @xmath111 , which is approximately constant if the radiation loss is small .",
    "the energy conservation gives @xmath112 with @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the initial mass in the ejected disk , @xmath115 is the swept - up mass from the surrounding gas when the disk is expanding laterally , and @xmath116 is the density of the medium surrounding the bubble . combing the above equations , we can obtain @xmath117 v_{wx}^2 $ ] .",
    "there are two characteristic stages , i.e. free expansion stage , in which @xmath118constant for @xmath119 and deceleration stage for @xmath120 .",
    "the time scale switching from free expansion to deceleration is given by @xmath121 or @xmath122 . in the free expansion stage , we obtain @xmath123 for @xmath124 . in the deceleration stage ,",
    "@xmath125 , we obtain @xmath126@xmath127@xmath128 , we have approximated @xmath129cm / s , @xmath130ergs and @xmath131 .",
    "the switching from a linear relation to the quadratic relation takes place at @xmath132pc .",
    "the quasi - periodic injection of disks into the halo can form a sharp edge , where shock fronts result from the laterally expanding disks with quadratic shape , i.e. @xmath133 . in fitting the gamma - ray spectrum it gives @xmath134gev , which corresponds to a characteristic time scale of either adiabatic loss or particle escape @xmath135myrs .",
    "by using equation 2 , the characteristic radius of fb is about 5kpc , which is quite close to the observed size of fb .",
