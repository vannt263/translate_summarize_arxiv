    "a new model of charmonium in the context of the gauge / gravity duality was constructed at zero temperature using spectral data so that the model exactly reproduced the masses and decay constants of the ground state , @xmath0 , and the first excited state , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this model was then considered at finite temperature , where the dissociation temperature of charmonium was investigated . in this paper",
    ", we will examine the zero temperature model in the context of heavy - quark qcd sum rules @xcite . as a reference point ,",
    "the results will be compared with a similar analysis of a different holographic model of charmonium @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules were first developed by shifman , vainshtein , and zakharov ( svz ) @xcite .",
    "they provide a systematic way to compare theory and experiment and have been used in a wide variety of systems .",
    "qcd sum rules are based upon the two - point vector - vector correlation function of the heavy - quark ( charm ) current ; at zero temperature this correlation function can be expressed in terms of one function , the polarization function , @xmath2 , @xmath3 where the charm current is defined as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the charm polarization function can further be expressed in terms of a dispersion relation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the charm quark electric charge , and @xmath8 is the imaginary part of the polarization function and is related to the cross section @xmath9 as @xmath10    qcd sum rules states that the cross section , and thereby the polarization , can be formulated either from experimental data or theoretically from an operator product expansion ( ope ) . since both of these should describe the same physics , the polarization function one obtains from either method should be the same .",
    "this leads to the construction of equations between the polarization function calculated using either the opes or the experimental data .",
    "these equations can be solved for various parameters of the opes .    as pointed out by svz ,",
    "the ope side of the sum rule becomes tractable when one considers a regime where asymptotic freedom allows one to use perturbative qcd .",
    "in general , this is valid for energies which satisfy @xmath11 . for light quarks ,",
    "this is only satisfied when @xmath12 .",
    "however , in the case of heavy quarks , such as charm , the relation holds even when @xmath13 .",
    "svz used this fact to construct qcd sum rules which are unique to heavy - quark systems , heavy quark sum rules have been used at @xmath14 based upon the initial work of ref .",
    "@xcite ] . in the region of small @xmath15 , it is useful for comparisons to introduce the moments of the polarization function defined as @xmath16 one",
    "can then relate each moment between the ope side and the experimental data rather than the entire polarization function . in the original work by svz @xcite , using this method of comparison , they were able to calculate the heavy - quark mass and show the need for nonperturbative corrections to have better agreement with the data .",
    "recently , the development of gauge / gravity dualities based upon the ads / cft correspondence @xcite have led to holographic models which provide a new method of calculating the polarization function .",
    "therefore it is natural to apply qcd sum rules as a way to understand , constrain , and evaluate possible holographic models .",
    "the ope expansion has already been used for light quark holographic systems in order to show that the ads metric is sufficient to reproduce the leading large @xmath15 behavior @xcite , and agreement with the ope expansion has been a guiding principle in the construction of many light quark holographic models among which includes @xcite .",

    "for example , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contribute only @xmath105 to the first moment in the shift and dip model while this climbs to @xmath106 for the fifth moment .",

    "again this is not that surprising since the highest moments have a larger contribution from the @xmath0 state .",
    "the discrepancy seen between the shift and dip model and the rescaled @xmath17 model at the highest moments is because the rescaled @xmath17 model only reproduces the @xmath0 mass and not the decay constant .",
