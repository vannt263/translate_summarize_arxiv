    "recent experiments have shown that it is possible to study unitary nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum systems on long time scales @xcite .",
    "one important result of these investigations has been the observed lack of thermalization .",
    "the reason for this non - thermal behaviour is attributed to the near integrability of the system .",
    "this observation has motivated recent studies of the non - equilibrium properties of integrable quantum model hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the interest in this topic is also motivated by its relevance to a variety of experimental situations , including cold atoms @xcite , penning traps @xcite and josephson - junction arrays @xcite .",
    "there are many ways in which it is possible to drive a system out of equilibrium .",
    "quantum quenches , and coupling to baths with different temperatures ( or potentials ) are the most common protocols .",
    "while in the quench scenario the focus is on the unitary dynamics of the full system , in the second case one usually deals with an effective description of the dynamics of the subsystem only .",
    "different out - of - equilibrium dynamics have nevertheless similar characteristics , for example the presence of currents ( of particles , energy , or heat ) .    in this work",
    ", we study an ising - like model system driven out of equilibrium with a quantum quench in the presence of an energy current . in the usual quench protocol",
    "the system is prepared in the ground - state in the absence of any current , and subsequently the dynamics drives it to some excited state .",
    "the model hamiltonian we consider here allows for the study of two different new situations : a quench from the ground - state in the presence of an energy current , and a quench from an initial excited state in the absence of an energy current .",
    "the two scenarios are associated with different hamiltonians which , in a sense , are dual to each other . to characterize the system s behaviour we focus our attention on the entanglement entropy ( ee ) , as measured by the von neumann entropy , which is a central quantity in the characterization of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in sec.ii we introduce and describe the properties of the model hamiltonian , in sec.iii we consider the static properties of ee for this model , and in sec.iv we study the dynamics of entanglement following a quench .",
    "finally , we states our conclusions . in the appendix",
    "the reader can find more details of the calculations .",
    "we consider an ising spin chain in transverse field @xmath0 , with an additional dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath2 is defined as follows @xmath3 , \\label{eq : ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath5 is the coupling parameter determining the strength of the dm interaction . such an anisotropic interaction is present in many low - dimensional materials with the necessary crystal symmetry , and it originates from spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dm interaction is of relevance in quantum information theory , since it plays an important role in the physics of quantum dots @xcite , and in fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .    adding the dm term to @xmath0",
    "does not affect the solvability of the model @xcite , and interestingly enough it provides the system with a richer phase diagram .",
    "these features have been used in @xcite to study the effective out - of - equilibrium quantum dynamics of the model .",
    "@xmath6 can be viewed as a current term .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the equation of motion for the local energy density of @xmath0 , defined by @xmath7 @xmath8.\\ ] ] one can write the time derivative of the energy current as the divergence of the energy current @xmath9 with @xmath10 it thus follows that @xmath6 is precisely the sum over all sites of the local currents @xmath11 . therefore , the ground - state expectation value of @xmath6 @xmath12 becomes an order parameter indicating the presence of an energy current .",
    "once the total hamiltonian has been diagonalized , which can be done with the usual jordan - wigner and bogoliubov transformations @xmath13 the effect of the dm interaction is clearly observed at the single - particle level .",
    "the single - particle spectrum is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 the momentum of the quasi - particle .",
    "as can be seen in the above expression and in fig.[fig : spectrum ] , the dm interaction makes the spectrum non - symmetric with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "note that the ground state of the hamiltonian including the dm interaction is the same for all values of @xmath5 in the interval @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "in particular this means that , within this range of values , the ising model in a transverse field @xmath0 and the system described by eq.[eq : ham ] have the same ground state . beyond @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 )",
    "the fermi sea starts to be populated by the modes in between the zeros of the single particle spectrum ( i.e. between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in fig.[fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this implies that the ground state is not anymore that of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , since the dm term commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian , at the many - body level when @xmath18 we must have a level crossing between the ground state of @xmath0 and some previously excited hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "fig.[fig : phase ] shows the phase diagram of the model @xcite .",
    "there are three regions : ferromagnetic , polarized paramagnetic , and the so - called current phase , characterized by @xmath22 .",
    "the current phase is gapless , and the two - point correlation functions show a power - law behaviour with an oscillatory amplitude : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a non - universal function and @xmath25 @xcite .    in the following , we study the entanglement properties of this model , and subsequently we analyze new quench protocols for this spin system .    .",
    "we show the spectrum for 4 different values of @xmath26 , while keeping @xmath27 fixed .",
    "see also figures in @xcite . ]",
    "plane of the model in eq.[eq : ham ] .",
    "the dotted line is a critical line where the model shows the same universal properties of the quantum ising model in transverse field .",
    "see also figures in @xcite . ]",
    "in this section we show how entanglement can be used to characterize the different phases of the model .",
    "to measure the ee , we consider a bipartition of the spin chain into two subsystems a and b. for this setup a good measure of ee between the two partitions is given by the von neumann entropy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ground - state reduced density matrix of the subsystem a with @xmath30 spins .",
    "it is known that for critical one - dimensional systems the ee scales logarithmically in the subsystem size , with a prefactor given by the central charge of the associated conformal field theory ( cft ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the central charge and @xmath33 is a non - universal constant @xcite . on the other hand , in the non - critical region of the phase diagram ,",
    "the entanglement entropy saturates to a value which depends on the correlation length @xmath34 , @xmath35 both eq.[eq : critscaling ] and eq.[eq : noncritscaling ] characterize the ground - state properties of ee for one - dimensional systems .",
    "apart from the ground state it is also of interest to investigate entanglement properties of excited states .",
    "recently , two works have appeared on this topic . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that there are excited states for which the logarithmic scaling of ee can have prefactors different from the ground state , and that for some excited states the scaling can be extensive in the subsystem size , instead of logarithmic . in @xcite the authors have studied the connection between ee for excited states and properties of the associated cft not contained in the central charge .",
    "the ee of excited states is of interest also in the context of quantum quenches since in this setting the system is unitarily driven from the initial ground state to an excited state .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.[eq : ham ] naturally fits in this set of problems .",
    "following the discussion from the previous section the model we are considering allows us to study the ee of some excited states of @xmath0 , simply by tuning the coupling constant associated with the dm term .",
    "the excitations we can consider in this way are characterized by the modes in between the zeros of the single particle spectrum that get populated when @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) . for these states",
    "the ee can be evaluated analogously to the ground state of @xmath0 ( see also @xcite for related analytical study ) .",
    "vs @xmath38 at @xmath39 for different @xmath26 .",
    "the scaling behavior changes from @xmath40 on the critical line separating the ordered and disordered phase to @xmath41 inside the current - carrying phase . ]",
    "let us consider in detail the entanglement properties of the different phases shown in fig.[fig : phase ] .",
    "first , we compare the scaling of the entanglement in the non - current - carrying critical regions and in the region where an energy current is present .",
    "fig.[fig : scaling ] shows the result of the simulations for the scaling behaviour of the ground - state ee with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for all values of @xmath44 $ ] one observes the same scaling result . in the non - current - carrying region",
    "critical states are present only on the @xmath43 line of the phase diagram .",
    "on this line , separating the ferromagnetic and polarized paramagnetic phases , the ground state of the system is the same as in @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the ee scaling is logarithmic with a prefactor of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "note that also the entire current - carrying phase ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) is gapless , and in this sense critical . at any point in this phase",
    "we observe logarithmic scaling of the ee in the subsystem size .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion in the previous section on the algebraic decay of the two point correlation function .",
    "interestingly , the prefactor of the logarithmic scaling of ee in the current phase is twice as large as the prefactor in the non - current phase .",
    "this doubling reflects the increased number of zeros in the single - particle spectrum , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "in fact , when @xmath47 the ground state of eq.[eq : ham ] is the filled fermi sea of modes in between @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see fig.[fig : spectrum ] ) . since the ground - state in the current phase is effectively an excited eigenstate of @xmath0 , we could expect a scaling of ee that is extensive in the system size , as shown in @xcite for excited states .",
    "the reason why this is not the case is due to the nature of the single - particle spectrum , which at most can have two zeros ( see fig.[fig : spectrum ] ) , and thus does not satisfy the requirements found in @xcite for an extensive scaling of ee .",
    "the dm interaction in the hamiltonian affects also the sub - leading term in the scaling of ee @xmath51 . deriving the analytical form of the sub - leading order term @xmath52",
    "is complicated .",
    "nonetheless , one can investigate this term numerically . in fig.[fig",
    ": sublead ] we see that @xmath53 is constant on the critical line @xmath43 with @xmath54 .",
    "as soon as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath53 increases , but becomes almost constant for large @xmath26 . also @xmath53 is maximum at @xmath57 , and @xmath53 is minimum at the critical point @xmath58 . from the behaviour of",
    "@xmath53 we can conclude that a given block has the highest entanglement when all the negative modes ( @xmath59 ) in the fermi sea are filled . consequently ee increases with higher values of the energy current .",
    "we now consider the differences between the critical lines shown in the phase diagram ( fig.[fig : phase ] ) , separating different phases . the only second - order quantum phase transition is found along at the @xmath43 line ( with @xmath60 ) , which corresponds to the ising quantum phase transition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iiqpt ] ) . on the hand",
    "the boundaries of the current - carrying phase with both the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phases are characterized by a level crossing .",
    "this translates into a sudden jump in ee ( see fig.[fig : iiqpt ] and fig.[fig : iqpt ] ) .",
    "the value of ee is always higher in the current carrying phase because of the presence of long - range correlations that decay algebraically .",
    "the plots in fig.[fig : iiqpt ] and fig.[fig : iqpt ] show that controlling the dm term can be used as an entanglement switch .",
    "the amount of entanglement can be driven by the dm coupling term or the magnetic field , which are controllable parameters in optical lattices @xcite .    .",

    "in this section , we focus on the quench dynamics of the ee .",
    "quenching provides a way to excite a system , initially prepared in the ground state , and to subsequently study the non - equilibrium dynamics of the model ( in the following , we denote with a subscript @xmath67 the value of the parameters describing the initial hamiltonian ) .",
    "as stated previously , the model in eq.[eq : ham ] is of interest because it combines two different mechanisms typically used to drive a system out of equilibrium : quantum quenching , and the coupling to a field originating a current in the system .",
    "furthermore the inclusion of the dm term allows us to study a model hamiltonian where the energy current can be controlled and used in the quench protocol .    in our setup",
    ", the quench can either involve the magnetic field @xmath61 , the dm coupling @xmath26 or a combination of the two . since the dm term commutes with the hamiltonian , a quench in @xmath5 leaves the system in one of its eigenstates , providing a trivial evolution of the ee . on the other hand , quenches in the magnetic field give more interesting behaviours . if the quench is done with the initial state prepared in a region with no current the results are similar to those found in @xcite , where quenches for the @xmath0 were considered .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the absence of a current , the ground - state wave function initially is identical to that of @xmath0 , and the time evolution is not affected by the presence of the dm term ( see the derivation of eq.[eq : timecorrelation ] in the appendix for a proof of this ) . more interestingly ,",
    "if the quench involves an initial state inside the current phase , new non - trivial behaviours can be expected , since the ground state now is radically different .",
    "it is important to notice that the dm coupling enters only in the specification of the initial state , whereas the evolution can be effectively described by the hamiltonian without the dm term .",
    "the calculations showing that this is in fact the case can be found in the appendix .     vs. the time steps , with @xmath62 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for different @xmath61 .",
    "note that the extent of the initial linear regime depends on the particular evolving hamiltonian . ]",
    "we first compare the evolution of the ee for different quenches inside the current - carrying phase .",
    "fixing the coupling constant of the dm term , and quenching only the external magnetic field we obtain the results shown in fig.[fig : quincurr1 ] .",
    "one always has an initial ballistic evolution of the ee , which grows linearly in time ( measured in units where the speed of the elementary excitation is unity ) and saturates at some point .",
    "quite interestingly , the saturation time ( hence also the rate at which entanglement is initially building up ) depends on the particular evolving hamiltonian . this way we can control the time needed to generate the maximal asymptotic amount of entanglement .",
    "this property is relevant also from a computational point of view .",
    "in fact , dmrg - like schemes , used for the simulation of the time evolution of quantum systems , can take advantage of the lower rate at which entanglement is generated . knowing the regions in the phase diagram where such rates are lower can provide more efficient time simulations .",
    "as far as we know this is a new feature that is not present in other quench protocols considered so far in the literature .",
    "the other aspect that is important to notice in fig.[fig : quincurr1 ] is the special role played by the line @xmath43 in the phase diagram , which turns out to provide the maximum asymptotic ee for different quench parameters .",
    "this can be understood by mapping the quench for @xmath70 to a quench protocol for @xmath0 only .",
    "as stated in the previous section , the entanglement evolution with respect to @xmath71 is identical to the evolution with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , the ground state of @xmath73 , the initial hamiltonian in the quench protocol is also an excited eigenstate of @xmath74 , because of the commutativity of the dm term with the total hamiltonian . from this dual perspective the effect of the current is that of effectively quenching an excited eigenstate without the current term . for the ising model ,",
    "a quench from @xmath75 yields the maximum value of @xmath76 when quenched to @xmath43 , because the energy gap closes at @xmath43 , and hence a large number of zero energy excitations can be produced . while the asymptotic value of ee depends on the particular excited state at the beginning of the quench .    .",
    "@xmath77 vs. the time steps with @xmath62 , @xmath78 to @xmath43 for different @xmath79 . ]",
    "fig.[fig : quincurr2 ] shows results of simulations for quenches with increasing values of the dm field in the current - carrying phase .",
    "the asymptotic value of the ee decreases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent with the phenomenological picture provided in @xcite , and with the fact that if the system starts in an excited state , the available number of unoccupied modes that can be occupied after the quench is smaller than in the case of having the ground state as an initial state .",
    "furthermore , fig.[fig : quincurr2 ] shows that the time at which the ee saturates does not depend on @xmath5 , and consequently does not depend on the particular initial hamiltonian eigenstates ( as long as it is not an eigenstate of the evolving hamiltonian ) .",
    "the line with @xmath80 in fig.[fig : quincurr2 ] shows that very deep into the current phase quenching does not create entanglement .",
    "in fact , when @xmath81 quenching the magnetic field is just a small perturbation to the hamiltonian , which then approximately stays in the ground state .     vs. the time steps inside the current - carrying phase for different block sizes @xmath38 .",
    "quenching is done from @xmath82 to @xmath39 with @xmath83 . ]    finally , we verify that the presence of an energy current does not affect the extensive nature of the asymptotic value of ee ( fig.[fig : l ] ) , and its proportionality with the quench size ( fig.[fig : quenchsize ] ) .     vs. the time steps for quenches to @xmath43 from various @xmath84 inside the current - carrying phase at @xmath85 .",
    "we have studied the static and dynamic properties of the entanglement entropy in the ising spin chain with a transverse field and a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "the model is characterized by the presence of an energy current for certain regions of the phase diagram .    concerning the static properties we have analyzed the transitions between phases with no energy current and the phase where an energy current is present .",
    "the transition is captured by a discontinuity of ee as a function of the parameters , and by a distinguishable scaling behaviour in the current - carrying and non - current - carrying regions . in particular , the leading logarithmic term of the ee scaling with respect to the system size has a prefactor in the current - carrying region which is twice as large compared to the second order ising critical line .    concerning the behaviour of the entanglement evolution following a quench",
    ", the model in eq.[eq : ham ] allows us to study new quench protocols .",
    "the usual schemes consider quenches from an initial ground state .",
    "this scenario , for the model in eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] , effectively corresponds to a quench from an initially excited state of the ising spin chain in transverse field ( without dm interaction ) .",
    "the main result of this analysis shows that the ballistic picture presented in @xcite is still valid , although with a significantly different aspect . in particular the entanglement saturation time in the current - carrying phase depends on the details of the evolving hamiltonian .",
    "this is an indication of the role played by the evolving hamiltonian on the propagation of excitations .",
    "this result is of relevance in tuning the dynamics of the system in regions with a different rate for the propagation of entanglement .",
    "furthermore it also provides a characterization of the regions in the phase diagram that can be simulated more efficiently with dmrg - like techniques .    from a general point of view , the model in eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] also suggests a simple way to study the quench dynamics of initial excited states in integrable systems .",
    "the addition of a commuting term in the hamiltonian causes a reshuffling of the spectrum that , without changing the integrability of the model , allows us to obtain non - trivial results about the excitations in the original model .",
    "the same trick can be applied to other systems of interest .",

    "initially the system is prepared in the ground state of an hamiltonian @xmath118 , and suddenly one of the parameters is changed , and the new hamiltonian is denoted by @xmath119 . the quasi - particle operator vector @xmath120 is associated with @xmath118 , and the vector @xmath121 is associated with @xmath119 .",

    "it can be easily seen that @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , with @xmath128 a parameter of the bogoliubov transformation @xcite . from which we can write @xmath129 .",
    "when a quench takes place , the time evolution of the fermion operators is given by @xmath130 .",
    "we can write @xmath131 , where @xmath132 notice that the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian in eq.[eq : ham ] is not symmetric , which means that in general @xmath133 . in order to evaluate the two - point correlation functions we consider different cases",
    "when the initial state of the system is in the non - current - carrying region we have @xmath134 if the initial state of the system is in the current - carrying phase and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the zeros of the spectrum then @xmath138 for @xmath139 lying between @xmath140 and @xmath141 we have @xmath142 a compact way of expressing eq.[b1 ] , eq.[b2 ] , and eq.[b3 ] is given by @xmath143 finally we can write @xmath144 notice that the above expression is the same if we consider @xmath145 , with @xmath146 the single particle spectrum of eq.[eq : ham ] , or if we consider @xmath145 , with @xmath146 the single particle spectrum of the ising hamiltonian without the dm term .",

    "this proves that the time evolution of the correlation matrix in eq.[eq : timecorrelation ] , with respect to the ground - state of eq.[eq : ham ] , is the same as the time evolution of the correlation matrix with respect to the ising hamiltonian in transverse field , with respect to an excited state of the ising hamiltonian ."
