    "rydberg atoms , i.e.  atoms with large principal quantum numbers @xmath5 , have been the subject of extensive research due to their unique optical and electrical features @xcite .",
    "they are an ideal platform for the study of a wide range of quantum phenomena , mainly since their properties scale strongly with @xmath6 , and often turning them extraordinary relative to those of ground - state atoms .",
    "the property which has stimulated the most recent experimental and theoretical work is strong interactions among rydberg atoms that are separated by relatively large distances of several @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , electronic excitations can be delocalized among distant atoms through resonant dipole - dipole interactions to form collective electronic excitations that are termed excitons @xcite .",
    "different processes of resonant energy transfer are possible @xcite , here we concentrate on the exchange type , e.g. @xmath7 .",
    "excitons have been introduced to a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice with lowest excited states where van der waals interactions are negligible @xcite",
    ". the formation of excitons in a cluster of rydberg atoms has been investigated , but van der waals forces were completely neglected and the discussion limited to two - level atoms @xcite . in previous work we investigated the influence of van der waals interactions on the formation of excitons in an aggregate of two - level rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "coherent energy transfer among rydberg atoms that induces by resonant dipole - dipole interaction has been realized experimentally at large interatomic distances of tenths @xmath4 where van der waals forces are negligible @xcite .",
    "an excitonic state contains at least two different atomic states .",
    "the simplest case is of two atoms in which one in the @xmath0 state and the other in the @xmath1 state .",
    "the discussion can be limited to dipole - dipole interactions , where dipole - quadrupole , quadrupole - quadrupole and higher order interactions are neglected .",
    "approximate long - range potentials can be derived by applying perturbation theory up to the second order in the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the lowest order term of the perturbation series results in resonant dipole - dipole interaction of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the interatomic distance with the resonant dipole - dipole coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "this interaction leads to a coherent mixing of the two possible states , which are @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the second order term is of the van der waals type of the form @xmath13 , with the van der waals coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "as was shown in our previous work @xcite , van der waals interactions result in energy shifts that significantly influence the formation of excitons when atoms approach each other .",
    "higher order terms play significant roles and can change completely the long - range interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of resonances breaks down the validity of the perturbative calculation and then other techniques are required , e.g. in using direct hamiltonian diagonalization @xcite .",
    "moreover , non - adiabatic interactions between rydberg atoms in different electronic surfaces can be important @xcite .",
    "long - range van der waals interactions among pairs of rydberg atoms have been intensively investigated , mainly using a perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "the dispersion coefficients of the type @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are calculated and listed for homonuclear dimers of alkali metal atoms in the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 states , where both atoms are in the same state .",
    "these coefficients are of importance for experimental and theoretical applications in strongly interacting rydberg gases , especially for the current cold and ultracold rydberg atom experiments , e.g. , in the implementation of dipole blockade phenomena for quantum information processing @xcite . but",
    "coefficients of the mixed type in which atoms are in different electronic states , e.g. , @xmath2 , are not much emphasized , while they are of importance for processes that involve resonant energy transfer @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the influence of the formation of excitons on van der waals interactions among rydberg atoms .",
    "we check the validity of using the simple model of two - level systems to describe excitons in interacting rydberg atoms .",
    "we start by developing simple models using three and four atomic levels that provide a qualitative understanding of the different interactions among rydberg atoms . in treating @xmath17 and @xmath18 rydberg atoms",
    "we extract the limit in which atom - atom interactions have the forms @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for the case of @xmath22 rydberg atoms",
    "we derive the condition in which the interactions can be described by @xmath8 and @xmath13 terms .",
    "afterwards , we exploit perturbation theory in order to get quantitative values for all @xmath23 and @xmath3 coefficients by summing over all the allowed atomic states .",
    "we treat rydberg alkali metal atoms , and as an example we present the values for lithium atoms .",
    "we emphasize here van der waals interactions of the mixed type with coefficient @xmath2 , and examine the effect of resonant dipole - dipole transfer on van der waals interactions .",
    "the point is that as the two states @xmath11 and @xmath12 are degenerate , perturbation theory implies the removal of these degeneracy .",
    "but the states are coupled by resonant dipole - dipole interactions and the diagonalization mixes and splits them to yield symmetric and antisymmetric orthogonal states",
    ". then we use these orthogonal states as the zero order eigenstates in the perturbative calculation of the van der waals interactions .",
    "we found that as the symmetric - antisymmetric splitting energy is @xmath9-dependent new resonances appear as the interatomic distance decreases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present a qualitative study of van der waals interactions among two rydberg atoms using multi - level simple models . quantitative derivations of van der waals interactions appear in section 3 using perturbation theory .",
    "section 4 contains calculations of van der waals coefficients for alkali rydberg atoms , and the results are presented for lithium atoms in section 5 .",
    "a summary is given in section 6 .",
    "the appendix includes the angular parts of the dipole moment matrix elements .",
    "we start by treating rydberg atoms using models of two , three and four - level systems .",
    "the derivations provide a qualitative understanding of the type of interactions that can appear among rydberg atoms and pave the way towards the quantitative treatment presented in the next section .",
    "we examine the validity of using two - level systems for describing excitons in rydberg atoms .",
    "the model of two - level systems is widely used to describe frenkel excitons in organic solids involving lowest excited states where van der waals interactions result in small energy shifts @xcite .",
    "but for rydberg atoms van der waals forces are significant and the appearance of resonances is probable .",
    "hence we examine the validity of using the simple model of two - level systems for rydberg atoms .",
    "our objective in this section is to extend the simple model into multi - level systems , which are necessary in order to exploit the appearance of resonances .",
    "we show that far from resonances one can keep the simple model but in including energy shifts due to van der waals interactions , which implies quantitative calculations of the van der waals coefficients that we calculate in the next section using perturbation theory .",
    "let us assume the two atoms to be in the same internal atomic level , say in the @xmath24 state .",
    "the two - atom state is @xmath25 of energy @xmath26 .",
    "we assume a single channel to be close to resonance with this state .",
    "namely , we consider a process of the transfer type @xmath27 .",
    "we have two possible degenerate final states @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with the energy @xmath30 .",
    "the states have the energy detuning @xmath31 .",
    "we assume here coupling among the @xmath32 state and each one of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states , with the coupling parameter @xmath35 , which we specify later . we neglect coupling among the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states .",
    "the hamiltonian that is restricted to the states defined above can be written as @xmath36 in matrix elements we have @xmath37 we diagonalize the matrix to get the characteristic equation @xmath38 , with the three solutions @xmath39 in the far off - resonant limit , that is @xmath40 , we get @xmath41 transfer processes are induced by resonant dipole - dipole interaction that have the form @xmath42 , where @xmath9 is the interatomic distance , and @xmath23 will be calculated in details later .",
    "we can also define @xmath43 , which is of the van der waals type . in the general case we have @xmath44 , where one need to calculate the van der waals coefficient @xmath3 for each specific states by considering all possible atomic transitions , which is the main aim in the next sections .",
    "next we consider the case of @xmath45 state in details .    in the case of @xmath46 of energy @xmath47",
    ", we have , e.g. , the channel @xmath48 , that is @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with the energy @xmath51 , and with the detuning @xmath52 , ( see fig .  [ n2ss ] ) .",
    "the energy of the two interacting atoms is @xmath53 , with the van der waals interaction @xmath54 . in the general case",
    "we can write @xmath55 . later on we calculate the @xmath56 and @xmath57 coefficients in details .",
    "similar consideration holds for the case of two @xmath58-state atoms .",
    "=      here we consider the case in which the atoms are in different states , e.g. , one atom in the @xmath45-state and the other in @xmath58-state .",
    "we get two degenerate states @xmath59 and @xmath60 of energy @xmath61 .",
    "we have , e.g. , the possible transfer channel of @xmath62 .",
    "further , we consider the two degenerate states @xmath63 and @xmath64 , of energy @xmath65 , ( see fig .",
    "[ n24 ] ) .",
    "their energy detuning compared to @xmath32 state is @xmath66 .",
    "the states @xmath59 and @xmath60 are coupled by the resonant dipole - dipole interaction of strength @xmath35 , where @xmath67 .",
    "the state @xmath59 is coupled to @xmath63 by the resonant dipole - dipole interaction of strength @xmath68 , and the state @xmath60 is coupled to @xmath64 with the same parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we neglect the resonant dipole - dipole interaction among the @xmath63 and @xmath64 states , due to their small amplitudes .",
    "the hamiltonian can be then written as @xmath69 in matrix elements we get @xmath70 we diagonalize the hamiltonian , to get the characteristic equations @xmath71 with the four solutions @xmath72 in the far off - resonant limit , that is @xmath73 , we get the energies @xmath74 as far as @xmath75 the shifts are of the van der waals type , where @xmath76 . in general",
    "we can write @xmath77 , where the @xmath3 coefficient will be calculated later .      in the light of this result",
    ", we can go one step back and start with two effective two - level atoms including van der waals interactions .",
    "we again treat the case of one atom in the @xmath45 rydberg state , and the other in the @xmath58 state , as seen in fig .",
    "the atoms are separated by the distance @xmath9 .",
    "we have two states @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and they are degenerate with the energy @xmath78 , where we include the van der waals interaction among the two atoms @xmath79 .",
    "the energy transfer parameter among the two states is as before @xmath80 .",
    "these consideration exactly fits with the above four - level model in the limit of @xmath75 , where the detuning @xmath81 is much larger than the symmetric - antisymmetric splitting .",
    "the hamiltonian is now written as @xmath82 the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by using the collective states @xmath83 which gives @xmath84 with the energies @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which fit exactly with the above derived energies .    as other states can be close to resonance with the considered states , the picture of two - level atoms breaks down at short interatomic distances of several @xmath4 .",
    "then , the excitonic picture implies multi - level systems , as beside the considered states , e.g. @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the formalism must include all close to resonance states , e.g @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as treated before . the model of two - level systems can be reserved for larger interatomic distances when other states are off - resonance , but in including van der waals interactions among the atoms .",
    "we adopted this direction in treating @xmath91 rydberg atoms in our previous paper @xcite . at much larger interatomic distances of tenth of @xmath4 the van der waals interactions are negligible .",
    "after this qualitative study of the resonant dipole - dipole and van der waals interactions , we move to quantitative calculations of the different @xmath23 and @xmath3 coefficients .",
    "we give first a general presentation of a perturbative treatment for the electrostatic interactions among rydberg atoms . for a system of two atoms",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the @xmath94 independent atom hamiltonian , and @xmath95 is the interaction among the two atoms .",
    "we assume the independent atom eigenstates to be known and given by @xmath96 , where the eigenstates are orthonormal with @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the lowest order interaction among neutral atoms is the dipole - dipole one , where @xmath99 with @xmath100 , and the interatomic distance is @xmath101 . here",
    "@xmath102 is the dipole operator at atom @xmath94 .",
    "we assume no permanent dipoles to exist , and hence @xmath103 .",
    "we have @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "the atoms are taken to be localized along the @xmath106-axis , which is also the quantization axis , hence @xmath107 we apply perturbation theory in order to calculate the resonant dipole - dipole and van der waals coefficients by deriving the corrections to each dimer energy .",
    "we write the perturbative terms up to the second order explicitly where the two atoms are assumed to be in the states @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the lowest order correction to the free energy is @xmath110 , where for the dimer we use a product basis @xmath111 .",
    "this term give rise to resonant dipole - dipole interaction that is responsible for the energy transfer among atoms at different internal states .",
    "when the two atoms are in the same @xmath108-th quantum state one has @xmath112 .",
    "only terms of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are nonzero , with the appropriate selection rules .",
    "we define @xmath115 , where now @xmath116 and the transition dipole matrix element is defined by @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .",
    "resonances can appear among the dimer states , e.g. , for @xmath119 and @xmath120 states with the energy @xmath121 , which implies the use of degenerate perturbation theory . in the following we present separately the degenerate and non - degenerate perturbation theory .      for non degenerate states",
    "@xmath119 the first order term @xmath122 vanishes , because the atoms do not have a permanent dipole .",
    "the second order term is @xmath123 which results in van der waals interactions . since @xmath95 has a @xmath124 distance dependence , we can write @xmath125 , where we have defined @xmath126 the present perturbation theory can break down due to the appearance of resonances at @xmath127 , and one appeals to other methods , e.g. , to the direct hamiltonian diagonalization @xcite .",
    "we now consider states @xmath119 for which a state @xmath120 with the same energy exists ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath128 , and for which also @xmath129",
    ". then we have to use degenerate perturbation theory and first diagonalize the degenerate subspace . here",
    "we concentrate in degenerate states of the type @xmath119 and @xmath130 .",
    "the correct zero order states have the form @xmath131 with energy @xmath132 the first order contributions then vanish and the second order term , which has a @xmath133 behavior is calculated by @xmath134 where the sum over @xmath135 and @xmath136 includes all states but @xmath137 .",
    "note that resonances appear at @xmath138 and then a special treatment is required .",
    "we calculate the @xmath23 and @xmath3 coefficients for specific cases that include the @xmath139 and @xmath140 states , and we concentrate in interactions among alkali rydberg atoms .",
    "we use the nondegenerate perturbation theory in order to calculate @xmath14 and @xmath15 coefficients .",
    "next we calculate @xmath2 coefficients , and as here a resonance appears between the states @xmath141 and @xmath142 we use degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "let us first present the atomic states for alkali rydberg atoms .",
    "the atomic state is given by the wave function @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the radial wavefunction and @xmath145 is the spherical harmonic function .",
    "in general the dipole moment matrix element can be factorized as @xmath146 , where the radial integral is @xmath147 and the angular part is @xmath148 here @xmath149 are the axis unit vectors with @xmath150    the radial wave function for alkali atoms in atomic units is given by @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 , with the quantum defect @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is the nearest integer below or equal to @xmath156 .",
    "for the energy we have @xmath157 .",
    "moreover we neglect fine and hyperfine splitting , which is a good approximation for lithium atoms that we present later .",
    "we present here detailed calculations of @xmath14 and @xmath15 coefficients for atoms in the @xmath45 and @xmath58 states .",
    "we concentrate on alkali metal atoms excited to rydberg states and hence we deal with a single electronic state at each atom that is represented by three quantum numbers @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .    we write the expression for the van de waals coefficients as follows @xmath162 where we defined @xmath163 and the prime over the summation indicates that @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "we have @xmath166 and @xmath167 as we treat two identical atoms , we dropped the atom index .",
    "we calculate the radial parts , @xmath168 , of the @xmath169 parameters numerically , and the angular parts , @xmath170 , are calculated analytically and presented in the appendix .",
    "we aim now to calculate the @xmath23 coefficient , which can be written as @xmath171 where @xmath172 and here we have @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "one needs to be careful when calculating the @xmath2 coefficients , as the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 are degenerate , and perturbation theory implies the removal of this degeneracy , as we presented before .",
    "the two states are coupled by the resonant dipole - dipole interaction , which yields two diagonal states of symmetric and antisymmetric mixing , where these orthogonal states used as the zero order basis for the second order perturbation theory .",
    "the diagonal eigenstates are @xmath175 with the diagonal energies @xmath176 where @xmath177 the diagonal states have splitting energy of @xmath178 .",
    "we aim to calculate @xmath179 with @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the calculation yields @xmath183    the @xmath9 dependence in the denominator through @xmath184 can bring new resonances as atoms approach each other and then the present perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "event hough , far from resonance , that is @xmath185 , the @xmath2 coefficients can be safely defined by @xmath186 , where @xmath187 as before the radial parts are calculated numerically , and the angular parts calculated analytically and presented in the appendix .",
    "we calculate now all @xmath3 and @xmath23 coefficients for lithium atoms , by using the known defect parameters @xcite . for @xmath87",

    "requires the change @xmath195 , as we have a factor of @xmath196 from the energy , and a factor of @xmath197 from the radial function @xmath168 .",
