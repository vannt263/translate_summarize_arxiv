    "these are expanded preparation notes to a talk given on june 5 , 2013 at ilas .",
    "references are in @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers of ilas and especially * leslie hogben * and * louis deaett * , the organizers of the matrices and graph theory minisymposium for their kind invitation to participate .",
    "given a finite simple graph @xmath1 , let @xmath2 be the set of @xmath3 subgraphs and let @xmath4 be the union of these sub - simplices .",
    "elements in @xmath5 are also called * cliques * in graph theory . the * dirac operator * @xmath0 is a symmetric @xmath6 matrix @xmath0 , where @xmath7 is the cardinality of @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 acts on the vector space @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the space of scalar functions on @xmath2 .",
    "an * orientation * of a @xmath10-dimensional clique @xmath11 is a choice of a permutation of its @xmath12 vertices .",
    "an * orientation of the graph * is a choice of orientations on all elements of @xmath5 .",
    "we do not require the graph to be * orientable * ; the later would require to have an orientation which is compatible on subsets or intersections of cliques and as a triangularization of the moebius strip demonstrates , the later does not always exist .",
    "the * dirac matrix * @xmath13 is zero everywhere except for @xmath14 if @xmath15 or @xmath16 and @xmath17 and where the sign tells whether the induced orientations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 match or not .",
    "the nonnegative matrix @xmath20,when seen as an adjacency matrix , defines the * simplex graph * @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "the orientation - dependent matrix @xmath0 is of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a lower triangular @xmath6 matrix satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 is called * exterior derivative * and decomposes into blocks @xmath26 called * signed incidence matrices * in graph theory .",
    "the operator @xmath27 is the * gradient * , @xmath28 is the * curl * , and the adjoint @xmath29 is the * divergence * and @xmath30 restricted to functions on vertices is the * scalar laplacian * @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the diagonal degree matrix and @xmath33 is the adjacency matrix .",
    "the * laplace - beltrami * operator @xmath34 is a direct sum of matrices @xmath35 defined on @xmath9 , the first block being the scalar laplacian @xmath36 acting on scalar functions . to prove @xmath37 in general ,",
    "take @xmath38 and compute @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the simplex with vertex @xmath18 removed .",
    "now , independent of the chosen orientations , we have @xmath41 because permutation signatures change when the order is switched . for example , if @xmath42 is a tetrahedron , then the @xmath43 is an edge and each appears twice with opposite orientation .",
    "this just given definition of @xmath24 could be done using antisymmetric functions @xmath44 , where @xmath45 but the use of ordinary functions on simplices is more convenient to implement , comes historically first and works for any finite simple graph .",
    "a basis for all cohomology groups of any graph is obtained less than two dozen lines of mathematica code without referring to any external libraries .",
    "instead of implementing a tensor algebra , we can use linear algebra and graph data structures which are already hardwired into modern software .",
    "some source code is at the end .",
    "dirac operators obtained from different orientations are unitary equivalent - the conjugation is given by diagonal @xmath46 matrices , even so choosing an orientation is like picking a basis in any linear algebra setting or selecting a specific gauge in physics .",
    "choosing an orientation fixes a  spin \" value at each vertex of @xmath5 and does not influence the spectrum of @xmath0 , nor the entries of @xmath47 .",
    "like spin or color in particle physics , it is irrelevant for quantum @xmath48 or wave mechanics @xmath49 and only relative orientations matter for cohomology .",
    "while the just described notions in graph theory are close to the notions in the continuum , the discrete setup is much simpler in comparison : while in the continuum , the dirac operator must be realized as a matrix - valued differential operator , it is in the discrete a signed adjacency matrix of a simplex graph .",
    "functions on vertices @xmath50 form the @xmath51-dimensional vector space @xmath52 of * scalar functions*. functions on edges @xmath53 define a @xmath54-dimensional vector space @xmath55 of @xmath56-forms , functions on triangles form a @xmath57-dimensional vector space @xmath58 etc .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 is the * gradient*. as in the continuum , we can think of @xmath60 as a * vector field * , a function on the edges given by @xmath61 , think of the value of @xmath62 on an edge @xmath63 as a * directional derivative * in the direction @xmath63 .",
    "the orientation on the edges tells us in which direction this is understood . if a vertex @xmath42 is fixed and an orientation is chosen on the edges connected to @xmath42 so that all arrows point away from @xmath42 , then @xmath64 , an identity which explains a bit more the name  gradient \" .",
    "the matrix @xmath65 maps a function on edges to a function on triangles .",
    "it is called the * curl * because it sums up the values of @xmath66 along the boundary of the triangle and is a discrete line integral . as in the continuum ,",
    "the  velocity orientations \" chosen on the edges and the orientation of the triangle play a role for line integrals .",
    "we check that @xmath67 because for every triangle the result is a sum of 6 values which pairwise cancel .",
    "now look at the adjoint matrices @xmath29 and @xmath68 .",
    "the signed incidence matrix @xmath29 maps a function on edges to a function on vertices .",
    "since it looks like a discretization of * divergence * - we count up what  goes in \" or",
    " goes out \" from a vertex - we write @xmath69 .",
    "we have @xmath70 .",
    "the laplacian @xmath71 acting on one - forms would correspond to @xmath72 for vector fields @xmath73 , which comes close .",
    "we have seen already that the matrix @xmath74 restricted to @xmath52 is the * combinatorial laplacian * @xmath75 , where @xmath32 is the diagonal degree matrix and @xmath33 is the adjacency matrix .",
    "the story of multi - variable calculus on graphs is quickly told : if @xmath76 is a curve in the graph and @xmath73 a vector field , a function on the oriented edges , then the * line integral * @xmath77 is a finite sum @xmath78 where @xmath79 if the path goes with the orientation and @xmath80 otherwise .",
    "the function @xmath81 on the edges of the path is the analogue of the * velocity vector*. the identity @xmath82 is due to cancellations inside the path and called the * fundamental theorem of line integrals*. a * surface * @xmath83 is a collection of triangles in @xmath84 for which the boundary @xmath85 is a graph .",
    "this requires that orientations on intersections of triangles cancel ; otherwise we would get a chain .",
    "abstract simplicial complexes is the frame work in which the story is usually told but this structure needs some mathematical maturity to be appreciated , while restricting to calculus on graphs does not . given a function @xmath86 , define the flux @xmath87 as the finite sum @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the sign of the orientation of the simplex @xmath90 . while @xmath85 is a * chain * in general , element in the free group generated by @xmath5 , the assumption that @xmath85 is a graph leads immediately to * stokes theorem * @xmath91 .",
    "if the surface @xmath83 has no boundary , then the sum is zero .",
    "an example is when @xmath83 is a graph which is a triangularization of a compact orientable surface and the triangles inherit the orientation from the continuum .",
    "the exterior derivative @xmath26 is the block part of @xmath0 mapping @xmath9 to @xmath92 .",
    "it satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "stokes theorem in general assures that @xmath94 if @xmath66 is in @xmath95 and @xmath96 is a subset in @xmath2 for which @xmath97 is a graph . for @xmath98 , where @xmath96 is a collection of @xmath99 subgraphs",
    "for which the boundary @xmath100 is a graph , the later has no boundary and @xmath101 is the * divergence theorem*. we have demonstrated in this paragraph that tools built by poincar allow to reduce calculus on graphs to linear algebra . in general , replacing continuum structures by finite discrete ones can reduce some analysis to combinatorics , and some topology to graph theory .",
    "the @xmath7-dimensional vector space @xmath102 decomposes into subspaces @xmath103 , where @xmath9 is the vector space of @xmath10-forms , functions on the set @xmath2 of @xmath10-dimensional simplices in @xmath84 .",
    "if the dimension of @xmath9 is @xmath104 , then @xmath105 and @xmath104 is the number of @xmath10-dimensional cliques in @xmath84 .",
    "the matrices @xmath26 which appear as lower side diagonal blocks in @xmath0 belong to linear maps @xmath106 .",
    "the identity @xmath107 for all @xmath10 is equivalent to the fact that @xmath108 has a block diagonal structure .",
    "the kernel @xmath109 of @xmath110 is called the vector space of * cocycles*. it contains the image @xmath111 of @xmath112 , the vector space of * coboundaries*. the quotient space @xmath113 is called the * @xmath10th cohomology group * of the graph .",
    "its dimension @xmath114 is called the @xmath10th * betti number*. with the * clique polynomial * @xmath115 and the * poincar polynomial * @xmath116 , the * euler - poincar formula * tells that @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 and @xmath119 so that @xmath120 is the number of nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "linear algebra relates the topology of the graph with the matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the proof of the euler - poincar formula needs the * rank - nullity theorem * @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 as well as the formula @xmath124 which follows from the definition @xmath113 : the dimension of a quotient vector space is equal to the dimension of the orthogonal complement .",
    "if we add up these two equations , we get @xmath125 . the sum over @xmath10 , using @xmath126 , telescopes to @xmath127 .",
    "we have proven the * euler - poincar formula*. for example , if @xmath84 has no tetrahedra , then the euler - poincar formula tells for a connected graph that @xmath128 . if @xmath84 is a triangularization of a surface of genus @xmath129 , then @xmath130 which leads to the formula @xmath131 .",
    "an other example is the circular graph @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "a constant nonzero function on the vertices is a representative of @xmath135 and a constant nonzero function on the edges is a representative of @xmath136 .",
    "if @xmath135 and @xmath137 are both one - dimensional and all other @xmath138 are trivial , the graph is called a * homology sphere graph*. it can be a triangularization of the usual sphere but does not need to be as a triangularization of the poincar homology sphere . for triangularizations of compact @xmath139-dimensional manifolds , we have the * poincar duality * @xmath140 , the reason being that the dual triangularization has the same poincar polynomial and that the dual triangularization is homotopic , leading to the same cohomologies .",
    "this can be generalized to graph theory : whenever @xmath84 has the property that there exists a dual graph which is homotopic , then poincar duality holds .",
    "the betti numbers @xmath114 are significant because they are independent of homotopy deformations of the graph as we will see below .",
    "we will also see that they can be read off as @xmath141 , so that everything is reduced to linear algebra .",
    "these ideas were all known to poincar , who used finite - dimensional combinatorial theory to understand what was later called * de rham cohomology * of differential forms on compact smooth manifolds . historically , the setup in the continuum needed more work and georges de rham was among the mathematicians who made the connection between the discrete and the continuum rigorous .",
    "this paragraph should have shown that the cohomology theory on graphs just needs some knowledge of linear algebra .",
    "the vector space @xmath102 is the direct sum of the * bosonic subspace * @xmath142 and the * fermionic subspace * , the span of all @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath144 be the diagonal matrix which is equal to @xmath56 on @xmath145 and equal to @xmath146 on @xmath147 .",
    "for any linear map on @xmath33 , define the * super trace * @xmath148 .",
    "the relations @xmath149 define what witten called * super symmetry * in 0 dimensions .",
    "we prove here two symmetries of the spectrum of @xmath0 : the first is the symmetry @xmath150 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 is symmetric with respect to @xmath127 because if @xmath151 is an eigenvalue of @xmath0 then @xmath152 is an eigenvalue : if @xmath153 , then @xmath154 .",
    "the vector @xmath155 is the `` antiparticle '' to the `` particle '' @xmath66 .",
    "apply @xmath144 again to this identity to get @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , @xmath157 is an eigenvector to the eigenvalue @xmath152 .",
    "now , we show that if @xmath151 is an eigenvalue of @xmath47 to the eigenvector @xmath66 then it is also an eigenvalue of @xmath47 to the eigenvector @xmath158 . if @xmath159 , then @xmath160 .",
    "the two eigenvectors @xmath161 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath162 are perpendicular if we have chosen a basis so that @xmath147 and @xmath145 are perpendicular .",
    "the nonzero eigenvalues in @xmath145 therefore pair with nonzero eigenvalues in @xmath147 .",
    "this leads to the identity @xmath163 for all @xmath164 and to the * mckean - singer formula * @xmath165 .",
    "more generally , @xmath166 for any analytic function which satisfies @xmath167 .",
    "the reason is that the even part of @xmath168 can be written as @xmath169 and that the odd part is zero anyway because there are only zeros in the diagonal . by continuity and weierstrass",
    ", it is even true for all continuous functions . to summarize",
    ", we have seen that the spectrum @xmath170 of @xmath0 is determined by the spectrum of @xmath47 and given as @xmath171 as a set . because every nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath0 comes as pair @xmath172 , each nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath47 had to appear twice .",
    "the mckean - singer symmetry gave even more information : the pairs belong to different subspaces @xmath147 and @xmath145 .",
    "let us mention more anti - commutation structure which goes under the name  super symmetry \" .",
    "let @xmath173 denote the * anti - commutator * of two square matrices @xmath174 .",
    "we have @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the kronecker delta . while this again reflects the fact that @xmath34 is block diagonal , it explains a bit the relation with the * gamma matrices * @xmath177 introduced in the continuum to realize the anti - commutation relations @xmath178 and which was the starting point of dirac to factor the dalembert laplacian @xmath179 .",
    "the first order differential operator @xmath180 is now the square root of @xmath47 .",
    "such gymnastics is not necessary in the discrete because the exterior derivative and exterior bundle formalism are already built into the graph @xmath5 .",
    "vectors in the kernel of @xmath35 are called * harmonic @xmath10-forms*. for graphs , where @xmath47 is a finite matrix , the hodge theory is part of linear algebra .",
    "our goal is to prove the * hodge theorem * , which states that the dimension @xmath181 of the harmonic @xmath10-forms is equal to @xmath114 .",
    "the theorem also assures that cohomology classes are represented by harmonic forms .",
    "because of @xmath182 , the kernel of @xmath183 is the same as the kernel of @xmath27 , which consists of all functions @xmath66 which are locally constant .",
    "the number @xmath184 therefore has an interpretation as the number of connected components of @xmath84 . but lets start with the proof : first of all , we know that @xmath185 is equivalent to the intersection of @xmath186 and @xmath187 because @xmath188 shows that @xmath185 is equivalent to @xmath189 . we know already that the kernel of @xmath47 and the image of @xmath47 are perpendicular because @xmath47 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "we also know from @xmath190 that the image of @xmath24 and the image of @xmath191 are perpendicular .",
    "they obviously together span the image of @xmath0 and so the image of @xmath108 .",
    "we therefore have an orthogonal decomposition @xmath192 which is called the * hodge decomposition*. we use this decomposition to see that any equivalence class @xmath193 $ ] of a cocycle @xmath66 satisfying @xmath186 can be associated with a unique harmonic form @xmath194 , proving so the * hodge theorem*. to do so , split @xmath195 into a vector @xmath196 in @xmath197 a vector @xmath198 in @xmath199 and a vector @xmath194 in the kernel of @xmath47 .",
    "we see that @xmath66 is in the same cohomology class than @xmath200 .",
    "but since @xmath186 and @xmath201 imply @xmath202 and because of @xmath203 , also @xmath198 must be in @xmath204 . being in the kernel while also being perpendicular to the kernel forces @xmath198 to be zero .",
    "this means that the equivalence classes are the same @xmath193=[h]$ ] .",
    "the just constructed linear map",
    "@xmath205 \\to h$ ] is injective because a nontrivial kernel vector @xmath66 satisfying @xmath206 would mean @xmath207 and so @xmath193=0 $ ] in @xmath138 .",
    "hodge theory is useful : we not only have obtained the dimension @xmath208 of the @xmath10th cohomology group , a basis for the kernel of @xmath35 gives us a concrete basis of @xmath209 .",
    "furthermore , the * heat kernel * @xmath210 converges in the limit @xmath211 to a projection @xmath212 onto the kernel of @xmath47 , the reason being that on a subspace to a positive eigenvalue the heat kernel decays exponentially .",
    "we also see the connection with euler - poincar : for @xmath213 , the heat kernel is the identity which has the super trace @xmath214 . in the limit @xmath211 , we get the super trace of the projection @xmath212 which is equal to @xmath215 .",
    "if @xmath216 are two graphs on the same set of vertices , we can compare the spectra of their dirac matrices or laplacians . comparing the dirac operators is easier because the entries only take the values @xmath217 or @xmath127 .",
    "a nice tool to study perturbations is * lidskii theorem * which assures that if @xmath174 are symmetric with eigenvalues @xmath218 and @xmath219 , then @xmath220 .",
    "the left hand side is a * spectral distance*. we have rescaled so that @xmath221 , makes sense for * graph limits * obtained from finer and finer triangularizations of manifolds . define the * simplex distance * @xmath222 of two graphs @xmath223 with vertex set @xmath224 as @xmath225 times the number of simplices of @xmath223 which are different in the complete graph with vertex set @xmath224 . if simplex degree of @xmath226 is defined as the number of matrix entries in the column @xmath227 which are not zero .",
    "we immediately get that @xmath228 .",
    "i learned the above inequality from yoram last who reduced it to a theorem of lidskii , which deals with the sum of the eigenvalues @xmath229 of the difference @xmath230 of two selfadjoint matrices @xmath174 .",
    "here is yoram s argument : if @xmath231 is the orthogonal matrix diagonalizing @xmath76 , then @xmath232 @xmath233 for some integers @xmath234 .",
    "this is equal to @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237 .",
    "the statement has so be reduced to the classical lidskii theorem @xmath232 whose proof can be found in barry simon s trace ideal book .",
    "having been a student in barry s trace ideal course he gave in 1995 , i should be able to give a proof of the later too : it uses that a matrix @xmath238 which depends on a parameter @xmath90 satisfies the * rayleigh formula * @xmath239 if @xmath240 is a normalized eigenfunction .",
    "proof : differentiate @xmath241 to get @xmath242 and take the dot product of this identity with @xmath240 , using that @xmath243 gives @xmath244 and that the symmetry of @xmath33 implies @xmath245 . using rayleigh",
    ", we can now estimate how an eigenvalue @xmath246 of @xmath238 changes along the path @xmath247 with constant velocity @xmath248 connecting @xmath33 with @xmath32 . if @xmath249 is a normalized eigenfunction of @xmath238 , then @xmath250 . by writing @xmath251 , where @xmath104 is the eigen basis of @xmath76",
    ", we have @xmath252 .",
    "we see that @xmath253 with @xmath254 implying the existence of a path of stochastic matrices @xmath255 such that @xmath256 . integrating",
    "this shows that @xmath257 where @xmath83 is * doubly sub stochastic * meaning that all row or column sums are @xmath258 .",
    "since such a matrix is a contraction in the @xmath259 norm , @xmath232 follows .",
    "the mckean - singer result assures that some isospectral graphs for the graph laplacian inherit the isospectral property for the dirac operator .",
    "the question of dirac isospectrality is also studied well in the continuum .",
    "berger mentions in his  panorama \" that milnor s examples of isospectral tori already provided examples of manifolds which are isospectral with respect to the hodge laplacian @xmath47 .",
    "finding and studying isospectral manifolds and graphs has become an industry .",
    "one reason why the story appears similar both in the continuum and discrete could be that typically isospectral sets of compact riemannian manifolds are discrete and for hyperbolic manifolds it is always impossible to deform continuously .",
    "we can use the mckean - singer symmetry to see why it is not uncommon that an isospectral graph for @xmath36 is also isospectral for @xmath47 .",
    "this is especially convenient , if the graph has no @xmath99 subgraphs and only a few isolated triangles .",
    "this assures that @xmath260 are isospectral . by mckean - singer ,",
    "then also @xmath71 has to be dirac isospectral .",
    "an other example is given by trees which have no triangles so that @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , if a tree is isospectral with respect to @xmath36 , it is also dirac isospectral .",
    "there are various other examples of dirac isospectral graphs which are not graph isomorphic .",
    "the simplest examples are * dehn twisted flat tori * : take a triangularization of a two - dimensional torus , cut it along a circle , twist it along the circle , then glue them together again .",
    "again , the reason is super symmetry : there is isospectrality with respect to @xmath36 and because @xmath260 is the same , also the @xmath71 are isospectral by mckean singer .",
    "a concrete pair of graphs which is isospectral with respect to the dirac operator is an example given by hungerbhler and halbeisen .",
    "their examples are especially interesting because it was not brute force search , but an adaptation of a method of gordon in the continuum which led to these graphs .",
    "there are also examples of graphs which are isospectral with respect to @xmath36 but not with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "again , this can be seen conveniently without any computation from mckean - singer , if one has a pair for which @xmath260 are not isospectral , then also @xmath71 is not isospectral .",
    "most open problems from the laplacian go over to the dirac case : how much information about the geometry of @xmath84 can be extracted from the spectrum of the dirac operator ? to which degree does the spectrum determine the graph ?",
    "are dirac isospectral graphs necessarily homotopic in the sense of ivashchenko discussed below ? the examples we have seen are .",
    "while the dirac spectrum determines the betti numbers by counting zero eigenvalues , one can ask to which degree the traces or more generally the values of the zeta function determine the topology .",
    "lets call a graph with one vertex * contractible*. inductively , lets call a graph @xmath84 * simply contractible * if there is a vertex @xmath42 of @xmath84 such that its unit sphere @xmath262 is contractible and @xmath84 without @xmath42 and connecting edges is simply contractible . a * homotopy expansion * is an addition of a new vertex @xmath42 and connections to @xmath84 such that in the sub graph @xmath262 in the new graph is contractible .",
    "a homotopy reduction is the removal of a vertex and all its edges for which @xmath262 is contractible .",
    "two graphs are called * homotopic * if there is a sequence of homotopy steps which brings one into the other .",
    "a graph is called * contractible * if it is homotopic to a one vertex graph .",
    "these notion shadow the definitions in the continuum and indeed , ivashchenko who defined this first , was motivated by analogous notions put forward by whitehead .",
    "the definitions since been simplified by chen - yau - yeh .",
    "discrete homotopy is simple and concrete and can be implemented on a computer .",
    "it is useful theoretically and also in applications to reduce the complexity to calculate things .",
    "it motivates the notion of  critical points \" and  category \" and  index \" of a critical point .",
    "* morse theory * and * lusternik - schnirelmann theory * go over almost verbatim . for a function @xmath66 on the vertex set @xmath224 , a vertex @xmath42",
    "is called a * critical point * if @xmath263 is not contractible .",
    "the index of a critical point is defined as @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is the euler characteristic . as in the continuum",
    "there can be critical points which have zero index . by induction , building a graph up one by one one can see that the * poincar - hopf theorem * @xmath266 holds .",
    "this is completely analogue to morse theory , where manifolds change by adding handles when a critical point is reached by a gradient flow of a morse function @xmath66 . when averaging the index @xmath267 over functions we obtain curvature @xmath268 .",
    "curvature is defined for any simple graph and defined as follows : if @xmath269 the number of subgraphs @xmath3 of the unit sphere @xmath262 with the assumption @xmath270 then @xmath268 is defined as @xmath271 . the gauss - bonnet formula",
    "@xmath272 is a direct consequence of the euler handshaking lemma @xmath273 .",
    "curvature becomes more geometric if graphs have a geometric structure .",
    "while gauss - bonnet is surprisingly simple , it is also astonishingly hard to prove that @xmath212 is identically zero for odd dimensional graphs , where every sphere @xmath262 has euler characteristic @xmath274 .",
    "the vector space @xmath102 has also an algebra structure .",
    "this exterior product produces the * cup product * on cohomology .",
    "there is a relation between * cup length * which is an algebraic notion , and * lusternik - schnirelmann category * and the minimal number of critical points a function @xmath66 on a graph homotopic to @xmath84 can have .",
    "the relation between morse theory , homotopy , category and the algebra appear here in a finite setting .",
    "homotopy is an equivalence relation on graphs .",
