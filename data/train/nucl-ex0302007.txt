    "in elementary hadronic interactions with no strange valence quark in the initial state the associated strangeness production provides a powerful tool to study reaction dynamics by introducing an `` impurity '' to hadronic matter .",
    "thus , quark model concepts might be related to mesonic or baryonic degrees of freedom , with the onset of quark degrees of freedom expected for kinematical situations with large enough transverse momentum transfer .    in close  to ",
    "threshold production experiments , effects of low energy scattering are inherent to the observables due to strong final state interactions . consequently , the data allow to constrain microscopic interaction models especially in the case where direct scattering experiments are difficult to perform .",
    "exclusive data on @xmath5 and @xmath3 production in proton  proton scattering have been taken at the cosy11 facility at equal excess energies close to threshold  @xcite . in the energy range",
    "up to @xmath1 the energy dependence is better described by a phase space behaviour modified by the proton  hyperon final state interaction ( fsi ) than by a pure phase space behaviour  @xcite . however , the most striking feature of the data is the observed @xmath3 suppression with @xmath12 while at excess energies @xmath13 this ratio is known to be about 2.5  @xcite . considering only @xmath14 exchange , data on @xmath14 induced hyperon production via @xmath15 result in a ratio of @xmath16  @xcite , clearly underestimating the experimental value of  .",
    "kaon exchange essentially relates the ratio @xmath17 to the ratio of coupling constants squared @xmath18 .",
    "although there is some uncertainty in the literature on their values , a @xmath0 production ratio of 27 follows from the suitable choice of the su(6 ) prediction  @xcite , in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "however , effects of final state interaction as well as the importance of @xmath14 exchange for @xmath3 production are completely neglected by this simple estimate .",
    "inclusive @xmath19 production data in @xmath20 scattering taken at the spes  4 facility at saturne at an excess energy of @xmath21 with respect to the @xmath22 threshold show enhancements in the invariant mass distribution at the @xmath23 and @xmath24 thresholds of similar magnitude  @xcite . with only the @xmath19 being detected , it is not clear whether the enhancement at the @xmath24 threshold originates from @xmath25 production .",
    "qualitatively , a strong @xmath26 final state conversion might account for both the inclusive spes  4 results as well as the @xmath3 depletion in the cosy11 data .",
    "evidence for @xmath26 conversion effects is known from exclusive hyperon data via @xmath27  @xcite , and from hypernuclear physics , with @xmath28 as the dominating decay channel of @xmath25hypernuclei  @xcite .    in exploratory calculations performed within the framework of the jlich meson exchange model  @xcite , taking into account both @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange diagrams and rigorously including fsi effects in a coupled channel approach ,",
    "a final state conversion is rather excluded as dominant origin of the observed @xmath3 suppression . while @xmath5 production is found to be dominated by kaon exchange",
    " in agreement with the exclusive disto spin transfer results at higher excess energies  @xcite  both @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange turn out to contribute to the @xmath3 channel with similar strength .",
    "it is concluded  @xcite , that a destructive interference of @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange diagrams might explain the close  to  threshold @xmath3 suppression and a good agreement with the cosy11 total cross section results is obtained after including an overall reduction due to the @xmath20 initial state interaction .",
    "an experimental study of @xmath25 production in different isospin configurations should provide a crucial test for the above interpretation : for the reaction @xmath30 an opposite interference pattern is found as compared to the @xmath31 channel , i.e.  the @xmath32 channel is enhanced for a destructive interference of @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange .",
    "measurements close to threshold are planned at the cosy11 facility in future .",
    "contributions from direct production as well as heavy meson exchanges have been neglected so far in these calculations  @xcite but might influence the @xmath0 production ratio  @xcite .    employing both a @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange based meson exchange model neglecting any interference of the amplitudes and the resonance model of  @xcite",
    "the data on the @xmath0 production ratio are described within a factor of two of the experimental error bars  @xcite . the same holds for obe calculations performed by laget  @xcite , in which the relative sign of @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange is chosen to maximize the cross section .",
    "it should be noted that the latter approach both reproduces the polarization transfer results reported by the disto collaboration  @xcite and accurately describes @xmath33 invariant mass distributions of the inclusive spes  4 measurements  @xcite .    within an effective lagrangian approach both @xmath5 and @xmath3 production",
    "are found to be dominated close to threshold by @xmath14 exchange followed by an excitation of the @xmath34 resonance  @xcite , in contrast to the resonance model approach considered in  @xcite , where the influence of the @xmath34 on the @xmath3 channel has not been taken into account , and it is rather the @xmath35 that determines @xmath3 production close to threshold and both reaction channels at higher excess energies .",
    "recently , preliminary dalitz plot distributions obtained at the cosy ",
    "tof facility have been presented for the reaction @xmath36 at an excess energy of @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the data are reproduced by calculations by a.  sibirtsev considering resonance excitation and effects of @xmath38 final state interaction , giving evidence for a dominant influence of the @xmath34 resonance at this excess energy .",
    "measurements on the @xmath0 production ratio in proton  proton collisions have been extended up to excess energies of @xmath39 at the cosy11 installation  @xcite . in comparison to the experimental data , in figure  [ pkls_ratio ] calculations",
    "are included obtained within the approach of  @xcite assuming a destructive interference of @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange with different choices of the microscopic hyperon nucleon model to describe the interaction in the final state  @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in  @xcite , the result depends on the details  especially the off  shell properties  of the hyperon  nucleon interaction employed , although the actual choice does not alter the general result in  @xcite of only a destructive interference of @xmath14 and @xmath29 exchange explaining the experimentally observed suppression of the @xmath3 signal close to threshold . at the present stage both the good agreement found for jlich model  a  @xcite with the close  to  threshold result   and for the nijmegen model ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ pkls_ratio ] ) with the energy dependence of the cross section ratio should rather be regarded as accidental . in the latter case",
    "an su(2 ) breaking in the @xmath40 @xmath24 channel had to be introduced  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the relation between the @xmath41 amplitude and the @xmath42 and @xmath43 channels becomes ambiguous .",
    "only one of the choices leads to the good agreement with the data , whereas the other one results in a completely different prediction  @xcite .",
    "calculations using the new jlich model ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ pkls_ratio ]  @xcite ) do not reproduce the tendency of the experimental data .",
    "it is suggested in  @xcite that neglecting the energy dependence of the elementary amplitudes and assuming s  waves in the final state might no longer be justified beyond excess energies of @xmath44 .",
    "total cross sections for the reactions @xmath45 obtained at the cosy11 ( circles and squares  @xcite ) and cosy  tof ( triangle  @xcite ) facilities up to excess energies of @xmath46 are shown in figure  [ pkls_fit ] .",
    "obviously , in case of @xmath5 production , the energy dependence of the total cross section is much better described by a phase space behaviour modified by the @xmath38 final state interaction than by pure phase space . however , unlike the findings of  @xcite based on the at that time available data up to excess energies of @xmath47 , in the energy range up to @xmath48 @xmath3 production is equally well described neglecting any fsi effect .",
    "presently , the origin of this qualitatively different behaviour of the hyperon production channels is not understood : proton  hyperon final state interactions might be less important in case of @xmath3 production compared to @xmath5 production as already concluded in  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a fit of the energy dependence considering phase space and final state interaction effects implies the dominance of s  wave production and energy independent reaction dynamics , which might no longer be justified as mentioned above  @xcite . within the statistics of the present experiment , p  wave contributions",
    "can be neither ruled out nor confirmed at higher excess energies for @xmath3 production .",
    "consequently , high statistics @xmath3 data would be needed in future to study the influence of higher partial waves experimentally .",
    "qualitatively , a dominant production via resonance excitation  as investigated within the resonance model approach  @xcite  might provide a mechanism leading to different partial wave contributions , if @xmath5 and @xmath3 production close to threshold were dominated by the @xmath49 @xmath34 and @xmath50 @xmath35 resonances , respectively .",
    "studies on the reaction @xmath9 close to threshold have been motivated by the continuing discussion on the nature of the scalar resonances @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . within the jlich meson exchange model for @xmath51 and @xmath52 scattering the @xmath8 interaction dominated by vector meson exchange",
    "gives rise to a bound state in the isoscalar sector identified with the @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "both shape and absolute scale of @xmath53 transitions crucially depend on the strength of the @xmath8 interaction , which in turn is a prerequisite of a @xmath8 molecule interpretation of the @xmath6 .",
    "similar effects might be expected for the elementary kaon ",
    "antikaon production in proton  proton scattering , and first results of exploratory microscopic calculations have recently been presented  @xcite .      a first total cross section value for the elementary antikaon production below the @xmath54 threshold in proton  proton scattering has been extracted from exclusive data taken at the cosy11 installation at an excess energy of @xmath55 with @xmath56 including statistical and systematical errors , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the experimental technique is based on the measurement of the complete four  momenta of positively charged ejectiles .",
    "figure  [ ppkk_result]a ) shows the missing mass squared with respect to an identified @xmath57 subsystem : a sharp peak at the charged kaon mass corresponding to a resolution of @xmath58 ( fwhm ) is clearly separated from a broad distribution in the region of lower missing masses .",
    "the latter can be explained by misidentifying pions from @xmath59 events as kaons , where @xmath60 denotes a system of undetected particles .",
    "in addition , the excitation of hyperon resonances via @xmath61 may contribute , with one of the identified protons originating from the hyperon resonance decay , shifting the missing mass with respect to the @xmath62 subsystem to lower values ( as discussed in detail in  @xcite ) .",
    "considering both effects , the broad distribution is well reproduced as indicated in figure  [ ppkk_result]a ) .",
    "requiring furthermore a @xmath63 consistent hit in the dedicated negative particle detection system of the cosy11 facility  @xcite , the identification of the four particle final state becomes ( almost ) completely free of background , as demonstrated in figure  [ ppkk_result]b ) .",
    "the reduction in counting rate for the @xmath63 signal is due to acceptance and decay losses and in excellent agreement with expectations from monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , the available statistics of @xmath64 events extracted at the excess energy of @xmath55 is not sufficient to distinguish between a non  resonant @xmath64 production and resonant production via the scalar resonances @xmath6 and @xmath7 from differential observables , e.g.  the @xmath20 missing mass distribution  @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 production cross sections show very similar dependences on the excess energy : at excess energies @xmath68 the energy dependence of the total cross section is dominated by three  body phase space ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the deviation from a @xmath70 dependence below @xmath71 arises from the interaction between the final state protons and possibly between the final state proton and meson , the latter clearly observed in case of the @xmath72 reaction .",
    "these features are well illustrated by the data  @xcite on the reaction @xmath73 , where the possible effect due to the @xmath74 fsi is expected to be almost negligible .",
    "figure  [ kminus1]a ) shows the data available for the @xmath75 cross section as a function of excess energy q. the phase space dependence ( dashed line ) apart from the normalization constant reproduces the data at @xmath76 .",
    "calculations  @xcite obtained within one  boson exchange models neglecting the @xmath20 fsi explicitly follow the phase space dependence ( solid line ) , while the effect of the @xmath20 fsi is indicated by the dotted line .    data on the @xmath9 total cross section obtained at the cosy11  @xcite and disto  @xcite facilities below and above the @xmath54 production threshold , respectively , are in reasonable agreement with one  boson exchange calculations  @xcite without fsi effects ( solid line in figure  [ kminus1]b ) ) .",
    "contrary to @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 production the calculations for @xmath64 production differ significantly from the four  body phase space behaviour ( dashed line ) .",
    "the latter effect can be understood in terms of the energy dependence of the elementary scattering amplitudes which determine the energy dependence of the @xmath73 and @xmath77 total cross sections : while the @xmath78 amplitudes are almost independent of the invariant @xmath79 energy , @xmath80 and especially @xmath81 scattering data exhibit a substantial energy dependence  @xcite . comparing the cosy11 result   with the calculations shown by the solid line in figure  [ kminus1]b )  neglecting fsi  one might detect no room for final state interaction effects .",
    "contrary to this , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 production indicate strong fsi imprints at excess energies @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ kminus1]a ) ) .",
    "presently it is not clear whether the absence of the fsi influence in the @xmath9 reaction might be explained by a partial compensation of the @xmath20 and @xmath81 interaction in the final state or by the additional degree of freedom given by the four  body final state . in the latter case",
    "fsi effects are expected to be more pronounced at energies very close to the @xmath64 production threshold .",
    "it should be noted , that in the presence of two strongly interacting particles in the final state  @xmath20 and @xmath81  a factorization in terms of two  body interactions might no longer be valid and one would face a four  body problem .",
    "thus , further measurements provide a unique opportunity to get insight into the problem experimentally  @xcite .",
    "data taking at excess energies closer to threshold and slightly below the @xmath54 production threshold , i.e.  at excess energies of @xmath83 and @xmath84 with respect to the @xmath64 threshold , has been successfully completed early this year at the cosy11 facility and data analysis is presently in progress .",
