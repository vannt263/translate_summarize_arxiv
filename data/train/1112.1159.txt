    "squeezed states are such for which the noise in one of the chosen pair of observables is reduced below the vacuum or ground - state noise level , at the expense of increased noise in the other observable .",
    "the squeezing effect indeed improves interferometric and spectroscopic measurements , so in the context of interferometric detection and of gravitational waves the squeezed state is very useful @xcite . in a very recently published paper",
    ", agarwal @xcite revealed that a vortex state of a two - mode system can be generated from a squeezed vacuum by subtracting a photon , such a subtracting mechanism may happen in a quantum channel with amplitude damping .",
    "usually , in nature every system is not isolated , dissipation or dephasing usually happens when a system is immersed in a thermal environment , or a signal ( a quantum state ) passes through a quantum channel which is described by a master equation @xcite .",
    "for example , when a pure state propagates in a medium , it inevitably interacts with it and evolves into a mixed state 04 .",
    "dissipation or dephasing will deteriorate the degree of nonclassicality of photon fields , so physicists pay much attention to it @xcite .    in this present work",
    "we investigate how an initial single - mode squeezed vacuum state evolves in an amplitude dissipative channel ( adc ) .",
    "when a system is described by its interaction with a channel with a large number of degrees of freedom , master equations are set up for a better understanding how quantum decoherence is processed to affect unitary character in the dissipation or gain of the system . in most cases people",
    "are interested in the evolution of the variables associated with the system only .",
    "this requires us to obtain the equations of motion for the system of interest only after tracing over the reservoir variables .",
    "a quantitative measure of nonclassicality of quantum fields is necessary for further investigating the system s dynamical behavior . for this channel , the associated loss mechanism in physical processes",
    "is governed by the following master equation @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the density operator of the system , and @xmath2 is the rate of decay . we have solved this problem with use of the thermo entangled state representation @xcite .",
    "our questions are : what kind of mixed state does the initial squeezed state turns into ?",
    "how does the photon statistics distributions varies in the adc ?",
    "thus solving master equations is one of the fundamental tasks in quantum optics .",
    "usually people use various quasi - probability representations , such as p - representation , q - representation , complex p - representation , and wigner functions , etc . for converting the master equations of density operators into their corresponding c - number equations .",
    "recently , a new approach @xcite , using the thermal entangled state representation @xcite to convert operator master equations to their c - number equations is presented which can directly lead to the corresponding kraus operators ( the infinitive representation of evolved density operators ) in many cases .    the work is arranged as follows . in sec . 2 by virtue of the entangled state representation we briefly review our way of deriving the infinitive sum representation of density operator as a solution of the master equation .",
    "3 we show that a pure squeezed vacuum state ( with squeezing parameter @xmath3 will evolves into a mixed state ( output state ) , whose exact form is derived , which turns out to be a squeezed chaotic state .",
    "we investigate average photon number , photon statistics distributions for this state .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath4 photons in this mixed state is obtained which turns out to be a legendre polynomial function relating to the squeezing parameter @xmath5 and the decaying rate @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the photon statistics distributions of the output state . in sec . 5 and 6",
    "we respectively discuss the wigner function and tomogram of the output state .",
    "for solving the above master equation , in a recent review paper @xcite we have introduced a convenient approach in which the two - mode entangled state @xcite @xmath7 is employed , where @xmath8 is a fictitious mode independent of the real mode @xmath9 @xmath10=0 $ ] .",
