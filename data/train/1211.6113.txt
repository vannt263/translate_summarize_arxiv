    "the bulk of emission up to @xmath02 kev is thermal in nature .",
    "the small inferred effective radii ( @xmath132 km ) suggest that this radiation is associated with the neutron star polar caps .",
    "given the large characteristic age of the pulsar , the heat is most likely not due to neutron star cooling but is instead continuously supplied by an energetic return current from the magnetosphere above the polar caps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "above @xmath02 kev , @xcite have identified an additional faint component that is best described by a power - law .",
    "the nature of this spectral tail is less certain as it could be due to a variety of plausible mechanisms such as pulsed non - thermal radiation due to particle acceleration in the pulsar magnetosphere , unpulsed synchrotron radiation due to an unresolved , faint compact pulsar wind nebula or intrabinary shock , or a spectral tail caused by inverse compton scattering of the soft thermal photons by particles ( most likely electrons and positrons ) of small optical depth @xcite .",

    "the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) mos1/2 instruments were configured for full imaging mode .",
    "the epic pn was used in fast timing mode , in which only detector chip 4 is active , enabling 30 @xmath20s relative timing precision while sacrificing one imaging dimension . for the mos1/2 and pn , the thin optical filter was in place . the dispersed reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs )",
    "data yielded no interesting spectral or timing information , owing to the relatively faint nature of the pulsar , and were thus not used in this investigation .",
    "the data reduction , imaging , and timing analyses were carried out using sas 10.0.0 and ftools 6.10 , while the spectral analysis was conducted in xspec 12.6.0q .",
    "the raw ( odf ) mos and pn datasets was reprocessed with the sas emchain and epchain tools , respectively , and filtered for instances of strong background flares .",
    "discarding time intervals with severely contaminated data results in 104.9 , 104.9 , and 120.4 ks of usable exposure time for mos1 , mos2 , and pn , respectively .",
    "subsequently , the recommended processing filters ( flag , pulse invariant , and pattern ) were applied to generate the data used in the spectral and pulse profile analyses .",
    "for the phase - integrated spectroscopy , the counts from the pulsar in the mos 1/2 data were extracted from 60  circles centered on the source position derived from radio timing @xcite , which contain @xmath090% of the total energy at @xmath01.5 kev .",
    "the background was estimated by considering three source - free regions in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar . for the phase - resolved spectroscopy and pulse profile modelling of the epic pn dataset",
    ", the counts from the msp were obtained from rawx columns 2943 ( inclusive ) , corresponding to a 30.75@xmath21 circle in full imaging mode , which encloses @xmath088% of the total energy for 0.32 kev .",
    "this narrow extraction region was chosen so as to minimize the large background level ( owing to the one - dimensional imaging mode used for the pn detector ) , which dominates beyond @xmath030  from the source position . to obtain a reliable estimate ,",
    "the background was taken from source - free readout columns on both sides of the columns containing the pulsar .",
    "for the spectroscopic analysis of the epic mos1/2 and pn data , the extracted counts were grouped using at least 30 and 150 counts per bin , respectively .",
    "the archival _ xmm - newton _ observation of psr j04374715 ( observation i d 0112320201 , revolution 519 ) , with the same instrument configuration as the new observation , was performed with an unfavorable mean telescope position angle ( 137@xmath22 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the readout columns containing the pulsar emission are significantly contaminated by the background active galactic nucleus rx j0437.44711 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the new observation was carried out at a position angle that avoids the agn entirely ( 192@xmath22 , see figure 1 ) thus resulting in significant improvement in the quality of the timing data and a more reliable estimate of the background in the epic pn . in light of the problems with the archival data ,",

    "to obtain the x - ray pulse profile of psr j04374715 , the arrival times of the photons extracted from the pn source region ( fig .",
    "1 ) were translated to the solar system barycenter with the barycen tool in sas , assuming the pulsar position derived from radio timing @xcite and the jpl de405 solar system ephemeris .",
    "the corrected arrival times were folded at the radio ephemeris of psr j04374715 from @xcite using the tempo2 pulsar timing package . for an illustrative comparison ,",
    "figure 2 shows the radio , x - ray and @xmath14-ray pulse profiles of psr j04374715 all folded using the same ephemeris , hence showing the absolute phase alignment of the three pulse profiles .",
    "previous observations have uncovered that the x - ray pulsations from psr j04374715 is characterized by a single broad and asymmetric peak that is significantly wider than the radio and @xmath14-ray counterparts @xcite .",
    "the substantial improvement in photon statistics of the new data clearly reveals a previously unseen `` hump '' at phases 0.50.75 . for surface polar cap radiation , this feature likely corresponds to the secondary hot spot on the `` far '' side of the neutron star .",
    "the implied peak - to - peak separation of the two pulses in phase is @xmath00.55 as measured from the more prominent to the fainter pulse , substantially different from 0.5 as expected from antipodal polar caps .",
    "this implies hot spots that are not diametrically opposite , presumably due to a significant offset of the magnetic dipole axis from the center of the star .",
    "note that for psr j04374715 , the magnitude of the doppler effect that would be induced by the rapid stellar rotation is not large enough to cause the apparent asymmetry , especially when a h atmosphere is assumed ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the pulsed fraction ( defined by convention as the portion of counts above the pulse minimum ) of the background - subtracted lightcurves was determined from the pulse profile modelling presented in  6 in five energy bands : 0.2750.35 , 0.350.55 , 0.550.75 , 0.751.1 , and 1.11.7 kev . this approach yields @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that for the range of plausible ns masses and radii , isotropic surface thermal emission from a neutron star surface , such as that due to a blackbody , can not exceed @xmath033% even from point - like hot spots for the plausible range of ns masses and radii @xcite . nonetheless , the computed pulsed fractions are still in agreement with a predominantly thermal origin of the observed radiation if a h atmosphere is present on the neutron star surface .",
    "this is because the inherently anisotropic pattern of the emergent radiation from such an atmosphere can produce much larger rotation - induced modulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slightly lower pulsed fraction at energies below @xmath0@xmath27 kev can be attributed to the contribution of emission from a larger portion of the stellar surface , as suggested by the uv emission from the pulsar @xcite and the spectroscopic analysis in  4 , which would be less modulated due to its greater physical extent .",
    "the pulse profiles for the other four energy bands are consistent with having identical pulsed fractions .",
    "although the number of source photons is quite sparse above 2 kev , faint modulations similar to those at lower energies are seen in the 26 kev band .",
    "closer inspection of the model spectrum shown in figures 3 , however , reveals a significant contribution from the hot thermal component , implying that the modulation may still be due to thermal emission .",
    "unfortunately , due to the high background of the epic pn data , combined with the significant decline in the telescope effective area at higher energies , no useful pulse profile information is available above @xmath03 kev , where the contribution from the thermal components is negligible .",
    "thus , only an uninteresting limit of @xmath1390% pulsed fraction for the background - subtracted emission can be placed , precluding any insight into the origin of the power - law tail .",

    "even though polar cap heating in msps is believed to be due to a return current of relativistic efrom from the magnetosphere above the polar caps , the h atmosphere model assumption of a heat source beneath the atmosphere is still fully valid .",

    "as suggested in @xcite , the power - law tail observed in the spectrum of psr j04374715 may arise due to inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the thermal x - ray radiation by relativistic @xmath215 of small optical depth .",
    "it is plausible to assume that such particles may be located in the magnetosphere above the polar caps . for the spectroscopic analysis of psr j04374715 , i use the compbb comptonized blackbody model in xspec @xcite . as additional parameters ,",

    "note that the inferred optical depth requires a particle density in the magnetosphere ( from the surface to the light cylinder 275 km above the surface ) above the polar caps to be @xmath0@xmath219 times the goldreich ",

    "it is interesting to note that this value is comparable to that required for psr j07373039a to explain the observed radio eclipses in the double pulsar system @xcite .",
    "the sizable collection of source photons in the pn dataset permits an analysis of the pulsar spectrum as a function of pulse phase . to this end , i have divided the pn photons in the 0.53 kev range into four phase intervals , with the first interval centered on the pulse peak ( see figure 2 ) . due to the overwhealming background , the pn data above @xmath03 kev was excluded from the analysis . moreover , as recommended by the xmm - newton science support center , photons below 0.5 kev were ignored in order to remove electronic noise artifacts seen in fast timing mode . above this energy , the importance of the cool thermal component seen in the mos spectra is neglegible ( as evident from the bottom panel of figure 3 ) .",
    "therefore , only two thermal components plus the non - thermal component are used .",
    "this choice of energy cut also has the consequence of making the fits nearly insensitive to @xmath220 . as evident from table 2 ,",
    "the power - law component is also poorly constrained since the @xmath221 kev band is strongly dominated by thermal emission .",
    "the spectral fits were performed on all four spectra simultaneously . for the blackbody",
    "fits , the spectra were fit with the same temperature , while allowing for the flux normalization to vary independently for each spectrum . in the case of the h atmosphere ,",
    "all parameters , including the flux normalization , were fitted jointly among the four spectra since the pulse phase dependence of the geometric projection of the emission area is taken into account internally by the model for a given set of @xmath222 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 . in other words ,",
    "the flux normalization in this case represents the true , deprojected area ( as measured at the stellar surface ) , which is the same at all phases .",
    "this was accomplished by taking advantage of a functionality in xspec that permits simultaneous fitting of phase - resolved spectra .",
    "in addition to the anisotropic emission pattern , an important distinction of the h atmosphere model from a blackbody is the angular dependence of the emergent spectrum . in particular , the continuum emission becomes softer for larger angles with respect to the surface normal as a consequence of the temperature gradient within the atmosphere .",
    "observationally , this property should appear as a shift in the peak of the spectrum to lower energies ( see , e.g. , figure 2 in * ? ? ?",

    "high - precision radio timing observations have measured the orbital inclination of the j04374715 binary system to be @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that the rotation axis of the msp has aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector as the ns was spun - up during the low - mass x - ray binary stage of its evolution .",
    "this scenario implies @xmath158@xmath233 or , equivalently , @xmath234 .",
    "therefore , i fix the value of @xmath158 to the latter value .",
    "the h absorption column along the line of sight was set to @xmath235 @xmath167 , while the distance was fixed at @xmath159 pc @xcite .",

    "varying @xmath236 over the range @xmath237 @xmath167 results in virtually no change in the fit since its effect is unimportant above 0.5 kev . in the analysis",
    ", i assumed a fixed mass and allowed @xmath228 to vary .",
    "the procedure was repeated for @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath3 and @xmath241 m@xmath4 .",
    "the fit was conducted simultaneously for four photon energy ranges ( @xmath242 kev , @xmath243 kev , @xmath244 kev , and @xmath245 kev ) in order to weaken any covariance between the parameters that define the emission spectrum ( temperatures and effectve radii ) from the geometric and relativistic parameters , which do not depend on energy .",
    "the energy ranges were chosen in such a way as to yield comparable numbers of photons for all bands and to reduce the contribution of background photons . to include the non - thermal component seen in the total spectrum , i absorbed the expected number of photons per bin into the uncertainties , assuming an unpulsed contribution and a @xmath168 powerlaw spectrum .",
    "the best fit values for each parameter were determined by searching the @xmath246 space . to ensure that the these values are the true absolute minima of the parameter space , the procedure was repeated for a wide range of initial values for each parameter . due to the complicated topology of the parameter space",
    ", the confidence intervals of the best fit parameters were determined by way of monte carlo simulations , using @xmath247 realizations for each of the four assumed ns masses .",
    "the best fits to the x - ray pulsations for the h atmosphere hot spot model are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the plotted best fit yields @xmath248 for 65 degrees of freedom . as seen previously , unlike a blackbody model ,",
    "h atmosphere emission can account for the morphology of the x - ray pulsations and large amplitude remarkably well . in comparison with the modeling in @xcite ,",
    "the best fit shown in figure 5 confirms the upward inflection in the lightcurve around phases @xmath249 , which appears to arise due to the secondary hot spot .",
    "figure 6 shows the @xmath250 plane with representative models for different varieties of ns eos ( see * ? ? ?",

    "if taken in combination with the best available mass measurement from radio timing @xcite , the limits are inconsistent with all but the stiffest equations of state .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lower bounds on the confidence intervals are much tighter .",
    "this occurs because for more compact stars it is not possible to produce the large observed pulse amplitude , owing to the stronger gravitational bending of light effect , which acts to surpress rotation - induced modulations .",
    "in contrast , the upper bounds allow for very large stars since large - amplitude pulsations can be produced more easily for a wide range of viewing geometries .",
    "the fits to the x - ray pulsations also yield constraints on the magnetic field configuration of psr j04374715 .",
    "in particular , assuming @xmath160 m@xmath4 , the magnetic inclination is constrainted to be @xmath255 degrees ( at 1@xmath2 confidence ) , suggesting a significant misalignment between the magnetic and rotation axes is reckoned from the spin pole towards the equator . ] .",
    "the latitudinal offet of the secondary polar cap is constrained to be @xmath256 degrees .",
    "as defined , a negative @xmath257 corresponds to a northward shift from the antipodal position .",
    "the displacement in the longitudinal direction is found to be @xmath258 degrees , indicating that the secondary spot trails the antipodal position with respect to the sense of rotation , as evident from the phase lag of the secondary pulse in figure 5 . based on equations 2 and 3 in @xcite and assuming the nominal best fit ns radius of 13.5 km , the corresponding net offset of the secondary hot spot from the antipodal position across the ns surface is @xmath06 km , while the implied displacement of the magnetic dipole axis from the stellar center is @xmath259 km .",
    "in this paper , i have presented an analysis of the deepest x - ray observation of a radio msp to date , namely , an _ xmm - newton _ exposure of psr j04374715 .",
    "the data permit a significantly better characterization of the spectral continuum of this pulsar in the 0.110 kev band compared to previous studies .",
    "although the observed radiation from j04374715 can be described well by multiple models , in all cases the vast majority of soft photons ( @xmath26090% ) appear to be thermal in nature .",
    "this thermal radiation exhibits at least three components , with the hottest two having total effective areas consistent with the expected polar cap size .",
    "the coolest component , on the other hand , appears to cover a significant portion of the stellar surface , consistent with findings based on uv observations @xcite . since passive cooling of any primordial heat stored in the ns",
    "can not account for the high global ns temperature ( @xmath260@xmath261 k ) , various heating mechanisms have been envoked to explain the excess , including : re - radiation of the energy deposited in the inner crust by polar cap heating , rotochemical heating @xcite , `` gravitochemical '' heating caused by a time - varying gravitational constant @xcite , or capture of exotic particles in the ns interior @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for further discussions of the various possible heating mechanisms that may operate in psr j04374715 .",
    "an important goal of future observations will be to establish the true nature of the hard photons ( @xmath262 kev ) from psr j04374715 .",

    "better characterization of the optical and @xmath14-ray emission from this pulsar may offer additional clues into the nature of this radiation .",
    "in addition , with the recent launch of nustar , a hard x - ray focusing telescope covering the 679 kev range , further insight could be gained into the connection between the harder x - ray and @xmath14-ray emission from this pulsar .",
    "for the first time , i conduct phase - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of a radio pulsar that correctly accounts for the system geometry and the radiation pattern of the atmosphere by jointly fitting the spectra from all phase intervals . with greatly increased photon statistics",
    ", this potentially powerful approach can yield stringent constraints on the ns parameters by utilizing a two - dimensional approach to spectroscopy in the photon energy ",
    "pulse phase plane .",
    "the model pulse profiles in figure 5 imply a significant offset of the secondary hot spot from the antipodal position , which in turn , suggest deviation from the standard centered magnetic dipole configuration . as demonstrated by @xcite , even a slight azimuthally asymmetric displacement of the pulsar magnetic field can substantially amplify the accelerating electric field on one side of the polar cap , which when combined with a smaller field line radius of curvature , leads to larger pair multiplicity . as a consequence , the death line for producing @xmath263 by curvature radiation shifts downward in the period - period derivative diagram , resulting in a larger number of pulsars having high pair multiplicities . if common among msps , and pulsars in general , these magnetic field distortions could have profound implications for studies of the pulsar population , modelling high energy pulsed radiation , and constraining the pulsar contribution to cosmic ray positrons .",
    "the analysis presented herein confirms that the x - ray pulsed fraction od psr j04374715 is consistent with the existence of an atmospheric layer on the ns surface and can not be reproduced by a blackbody .",
    "modelling of the thermal pulsations gives a limit on the ns radius of @xmath254 km ( 3@xmath2 conf . ) assuming a mass of @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "this lower bound is much stricter compared to the limit obtained from the shallower archival observations .",
    "this value is in agreement with several ns radius measurements using quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that these methods have resulted in a wide range of often contradictory constraints on the ns radius ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of x - ray bursts ) .",
    "this highlights the clear need to investigate the systematic uncertainties and reliability of these model - dependent approaches to constraining ns structure , including the method employed in this present paper .",
    "this issue notwithstanding , as demonstrated in @xcite , deeper x - ray observations of psr j04374715 should result in even stricter constraints on @xmath222 , especially when combined with further refinement in the ns mass measurement from radio timing and joint modelling of the pulsed x - ray and @xmath14-ray emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
