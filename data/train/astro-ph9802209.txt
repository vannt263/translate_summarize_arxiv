    "inflation produces metric perturbations , which are presently the most plausible cause of the observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) and which may act as the seeds for structure formation . during inflation the hubble radius @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the expansion rate )",
    "must have increased more slowly than the scale factor @xmath2 , while during the radiation and matter eras it increased as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the evolution of the hubble radius ( or , equivalently , the evolution of the expansion rate @xmath5 ) during inflation is usually modelled by assuming that the energy density is dominated by scalar - field potential energy .",
    "the number of dynamical degrees of freedom associated with the evolution of the scalar - field potential energy ( and hence the hubble radius ) is unknown .",
    "if there is only one relevant degree of freedom , that degree of freedom is called the _",
    "inflaton , _ and the scalar - field potential is called the _ inflaton potential .",
    "_    inflation models where a single inflaton field slowly evolves under the influence of the inflaton potential are called single - field slow - roll models .",
    "such models are very attractive because of their simplicity , because they arise naturally in a host of particle physics models , and because other more complicated models can often be expressed in terms of an effective single - field slow - roll model .",
    "the assumption that only a single scalar field is dynamically relevant can , at least in principle , be tested by a series of consistency relations which represent relations between the scalar and tensor perturbations produced in single - field models @xcite .",
    "inflation models where more than one scalar field is dynamically important are phenomenologically much more complicated , and almost certainly must be studied on a case - by - case basis . in this paper",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to the single - field case , where the scalar potential @xmath6 is the only piece of information to be specified .",
    "reconstruction of the inflaton potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) refers to the process of using observational data , especially microwave background anisotropies , to determine the inflaton potential capable of generating the perturbation spectra inferred from observations @xcite .",
    "of course there is no way to prove that the reconstructed inflaton potential was the agent responsible for generating the perturbations .",
    "what can be hoped for is that one can determine a _ unique _",
    "( within observational errors ) inflaton potential capable of producing the observed perturbation spectra",
    ". the reconstructed inflaton potential may well be the first concrete piece of information to be obtained about physics at scales close to the planck scale .",
    "as is well known , inflation produces both scalar and tensor perturbations , which each generate microwave anisotropies ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "as reviewed in the next section , if @xmath6 is given the perturbation spectra can be computed exactly in linear perturbation theory through integration of the relevant mode equations .",
    "if the scalar field is rolling sufficiently slowly , the solutions to the mode equations may be approximated using the slow - roll expansion @xcite .",
    "the standard reconstruction program makes use of the slow - roll expansion , taking advantage of a calculation of the perturbation spectra by stewart and lyth @xcite , which gives the next - order correction to the usual lowest - order slow - roll results .",
    "the biggest hurdle for successful reconstruction is that many inflation models predict a tensor perturbation amplitude well below the expected threshold for detection , and as we will see , even above detection threshold the errors can be considerable .",
    "if the tensor modes can not be identified a unique reconstruction is impossible , as the scalar perturbations are governed not only by @xmath6 , but by the first derivative of @xmath6 as well .",
    "knowledge of only the scalar perturbations leaves an undetermined integration constant in the non - linear system of reconstruction equations .",
    "another problem is that simple potentials usually lead to a nearly exact power - law scalar spectrum with the spectral index close to unity .",
    "in such a scenario only a very limited amount of information could be obtained about high energy physics from astrophysical observations .",
    "recently , wang et al .",
    "@xcite suggested an alternative danger to reconstruction .",
    "they studied the possibility that the potential might be sufficiently complicated that the slow - roll expansion breaks down , and a full integration of the mode functions is necessary to calculate the perturbation spectra to the accuracy expected by the next round of satellite observations by map and planck .",
    "it is , of course , clear that any perturbative procedure such as the slow - roll expansion has some limit to its validity . but here , the breakdown of the slow - roll expansion is particularly troublesome ; firstly because of the technical difficulty that there is no known method of computing yet higher - order corrections , and secondly because there is a general possibility that for sufficiently complicated potentials the perturbation series may not converge at all .",
    "however , the key concern for reconstruction is whether such a situation will lead to a _",
    "misconstruction _ of the inflaton potential .    in this paper",
    ", we shall argue that for the purpose of reconstruction the breakdown of the slow - roll approximation is in many senses desirable .",
    "first of all , we show that there is no practical danger that one can be misled into thinking perturbative reconstruction is working when in fact it is not .",
    "secondly , the very failure of the perturbative approach implies that extra parameters are required in order to explain the observed data set , and hence there is the prospect of obtaining a greater amount of information about the inflationary model .",
    "finally , we will demonstrate that the theoretical errors from the use of slow - roll equations are sub - dominant to the expected observational errors from a satellite experiment such as planck .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite described a particular , admittedly rather _ ad hoc _ , scalar field potential , for which they demonstrated that the result of exact mode equation integration differed significantly , by the standards of say the planck satellite , from the slow - roll expansion .",
    "we shall largely concentrate on that potential as a means of concrete illustration of the very general points we shall make .",

    "what we have seen in the example of subsection 5.1 is that despite slow - roll not working very well , and hence generating significant errors in the normal estimation of the power spectrum , the reconstructed potential still looks very good , especially in the light of expected observational error bars .",

    "perhaps we do believe that a complicated inflaton potential is at work , in which case a non - perturbative technique ( e.g.  fitting the power in different wavebands ) would be more appropriate . or a multi - field inflation model might be responsible , and one could test them on a model - by - model basis to see if they were compatible with the data .",
    "we have found that a complicated potential , such as the example used by wang et al .",
    "@xcite , would be a boon to reconstruction of the inflaton potential , as it would provide extra information accessible to observations , in the form of scale - dependence of the density perturbations .",
    "such potentials are also more likely to have tensor modes at a detectable level , which is required for a complete reconstruction to be performed .",
    "we have analyzed the impact of observational errors on the reconstruction , and conclude that any theoretical errors from use of the slow - roll equations are likely to be sub - dominant .",
    "one might even be able to test this be solving the mode equation for the reconstructed potential , though we have not tried to pursue that route here .",
    "finally , it has always been clear that there must be some limits to the applicability of perturbative reconstruction , although it does a good job even for the wang et al .",
    "however , such a failure should be immediately evident from the data , as one would not be able to successfully match observations with a truncated taylor series expansion of the power spectra .",

    "<S> if primordial scalar and tensor perturbation spectra can be inferred from observations of the cosmic background radiation and large - scale structure , then one might hope to reconstruct a unique single - field inflaton potential capable of generating the observed spectra . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine conditions under which such a potential can be reliably reconstructed . for it to be possible at all </S>",
    "<S> , the spectra must be well fit by a taylor series expansion . </S>",
    "<S> a complete reconstruction requires a statistically - significant tensor mode to be measured in the microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observational uncertainties dominate the theoretical error from use of the slow - roll approximation , and conclude that the reconstruction procedure will never insidiously lead to an irrelevant potential .    </S>",
