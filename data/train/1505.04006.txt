    "the ground state phase diagram of an antiferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate was studied experimentally in the regime where spatial and spin degrees of freedom are decoupled  @xcite , demonstrating a phase transition from an antiferromagnetic phase ( where only the @xmath1 zeeman components are populated ) to a mixed broken axisymmetric phase ( where all three zeeman states can be populated ) . in this regime",
    "the system follows the predictions of the single spatial mode approximation ( sma ) . in other ranges of parameters , however , spatial separation of components can occur spontaneously , and spin domains may appear in the ground state of the system  @xcite . in this case",
    "the ground state is either the antiferromagnetic phase or is phase separated into two domains , and the two possibilities are divided by a critical point that is characterized by a critical magnetic field .",
    "a system may become out of equilibrium when it is driven through the critical point due to the divergence of the relaxation time .",
    "if symmetry breaking occurs at the same time , this out - of - equilibrium process can produce various kinds of defects , depending on the dimensionality of the system and the form of the order parameter .",
    "the unified description of these phenomena is described by the kibble - urek mechanism ( kzm ) , which was studied in a number of physical systems , from the early universe to ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . among these ,",
    "bose - einstein condensates of ultracold atoms offer realistic models of highly controllable and tunable systems  @xcite .",
    "recent experiment with quasi - one - dimensional ultracold atoms confirmed the spontaneous creation of solitons via the kibble - urek mechanism  @xcite .    in recent papers",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that the quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to phase separated ground state in a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate of ultracold atoms exhibits scaling laws characteristic for systems displaying universal behavior .",
    "phase separation leads to the formation of spin domains , with the number of domain walls depending on the quench time .",
    "interestingly , the kibble - urek scaling law was confirmed only for the dynamics close to the critical point .",
    "further evolution led to postselection of domains , which gave rise to a second scaling law with a different exponent .",
    "the postselection was attributed to the conservation of an additional quantity , namely the condensate magnetization .    in this paper , we develop a method for investigating nonequilibrium dynamics of an ultracold system that is initially at thermal equilibrium . we apply this method to investigate the effect of nonzero temperature on the dynamics of the phase transition and the resulting scaling laws .",
    "we consider this problem within the framework of the classical theory of a complex field with exact equations of motion being the gross - pitaevskii equations  @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the transition includes both the condensate and thermal atoms that introduce thermal fluctuations in the system .",
    "we sample the initial thermal equilibrium within the bogoliubov approximation at a given temperature and for fixed total number of atoms and magnetization .",
    "modes orthogonal to the condensate are thermally populated according to the bogoliubov transformation . in our work",
    ", the field has to be interpreted not simply as the condensate wavefunction , but rather as the total matter field .",
    "we present both the results of single realizations of the field , which experimentally correspond to single experimental runs , and results of averaging over different initial states .",
    "we find that while the dynamics of the system can be altered by the thermal fluctuations , at relatively low temperatures the scaling law for the number of domains in the final state is intact .",
    "in the following , we consider a dilute , weakly interacting spin-1 bose - einstein condensate placed in a homogeneous magnetic field pointing along the @xmath2 axis . for the sake of completeness",

    "in the case of @xmath20rb or @xmath21na spin-1 condensate .    the total number of atoms @xmath22 and magnetization @xmath23 are conserved quantities . in reality",
    ", there are processes that can change both @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but they are relatively weak both in spin-1 @xmath21na and @xmath20rb condensates  @xcite and can be neglected on the time scales considered below .",
    "the linear part of the zeeman shifts @xmath12 induces a homogeneous rotation of the spin vector around the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "since the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to such spin rotations , we consider only the effects of the quadratic zeeman shift  @xcite . for sufficiently weak magnetic field we can approximate it by a positive energy shift of the @xmath26 sublevels @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the gyromagnetic ratios of electron and nucleus",

    ".    application of the method is justified for a very low temperature only since bogoliubov transformation is the approximate solution . moreover",
    ", very early evolution of the gp equations can display some transient effects due to the fact that the bogoliubov transformation used in the sampling does not produce an exactly stationary distribution .",
    "we have checked if such transients occur for parameters used in our simulations and found them to be marginal for the quantities we are interested in .",
    "the dynamics with gross - pitaevskii equations leads the two component antiferromagnetic initial state to equilibrium state for long enough times .",
    "the equilibration given by this coupled set of nonlinear equations is surprising because we known they may lead to the coherent off - equilibrium spin - mixing dynamics .",
    "indeed , it was shown by using mean - field theory and adapting the single - spatial - mode approximation , that the condensate dynamics is well described by a nonrigid pendulum and displays a variety of periodic oscillations  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the period of oscillations depends on the initial fraction of atoms in the @xmath85 component and is almost infinite in our case .",
    "therefore , the time scale associated with spin - multimode dynamics is much shorter and allows for equilibration of the system . the relaxation observed in the system is quite intriguing in particular in the context of prethermalization phenomena  @xcite .    in the low temperature limit , the bogoliubov theory well describes the equilibrium state of the system .",

    "in  @xcite we investigated the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic to the phase separated state in a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this continuous phase transition is driven by the change of the magnitude of the applied magnetic field . due to the spatial symmetry breaking in the phase separated state ,",
    "the transition is accompanied by the creation of multiple defects in the form of spin domain walls , with the number of domains dependent on the quench time .",
    "the concept of the kibble - urek mechanism ( kzm ) relies on the fact that the system does not follow the ground state exactly in the vicinity of the critical point due to the divergence of the relaxation time .",
    "the dynamics of the system cease to be adiabatic at @xmath88 ( here we choose @xmath89 in the first critical point ) , when the relaxation time becomes comparable to the inverse quench rate @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the distance of the system from the critical point . at this moment , the fluctuations approximately freeze , until the relaxation time becomes short enough again . after crossing the critical point , distant parts of the system choose to break the symmetry in different ways , which leads to the appearance of multiple defects in the form of domain walls between domains of 2c and @xmath45 phases .",

    "then , at @xmath108 the magnetic field is kept constant at the level @xmath109 . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] , the ground state of the system becomes separated into the 2c and the @xmath45 phase at @xmath110 , but the initial 2c state remains metastable until the point @xmath111 . at this point",
    ", the system is expected to undergo phase transition accompanied by spatial symmetry breaking .",
    "as described above , due to the finite quench time the phase transition has a nonequilibrium character , and multiple spin domains can develop in the system , instead of two as the form of the ground state would suggest .",
    "further , at the second critical point @xmath112 , there is no symmetry breaking accompanying the phase transition and the spin - domain landscape remains intact .",
    "the mean - field critical exponents of the symmetry - breaking phase transition are @xmath98 and @xmath113 , which according to the formula ( [ kz_scaling ] ) gives the scaling law for the number of domains as @xmath114 .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , this prediction is correct only for the number domain seeds formed close to the critical point .",
    "when the domains become fully formed , their number is decreased in the post - selection process , which is due to the existence of an upper limit for the number of domains in a system with conserved magnetization @xmath25 .    here",
    ", we investigate the influence of the finite temperature on the process described above . in fig .",
    "[ fig_snapshots ] we show the evolution of the density of atoms in the initially unoccupied @xmath101 state during the process of domain formation .",
    "the top figure shows a single realization of the zero - temperature truncated wigner simulation , which can be interpreted as a result of a single experiment . for comparison ,",
    "analogous result in the case of finite temperature , obtained using the method described in sec .",
    "[ sec_thermal ] , is shown in the figure below . while this particular example corresponds to a relatively short quench time , when the post - selection process is not very effective , it is visible that some of the initial fluctuations merge to form a single domain instead of two .",
    "the effect of the finite temperature can be seen as the picture of the dynamics being more `` fuzzy '' in the figure below , but the number of created domains and their properties seem to be unaffected due to the relatively low temperature .",
    "this conclusion is further confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig_scalings ] , where we show the results of systematic averaging of the number of created domains over many realizations of the initial distribution .",
    "the two sets of points showing the result for @xmath115 and finite temperature overlap except for the very long times , where some decrease of the number of domains in the @xmath116 case can be observed .",
    "close inspection of the dynamics leads us to account this slight decrease ( on average by less than one domain ) to the lower number of domains created at the symmetry phase transition when the initial state already contains thermal fluctuations . in particular , the finite temperature does not affect significantly the @xmath117 scaling law predicted to result from the domain post - selection process .",
    "this turns out to be the case for any temperature investigated by our method based on the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "we note that the scaling law may be affected by thermal effects at temperatures higher than the ones achievable using the current method .",
    "this will be the topic of a future study .",
    "in summary , we developed a method for investigating nonequilibrium dynamics of an ultracold system that is initially at thermal equilibrium .",
    "our procedure is based on the classical fields approximation with appropriately prepared initial state .",
    "we described in details how to model thermal fluctuations using the bogoliubov transformation , and demonstrated its validity by performing dynamical equilibration of an antiferromagnetic initial state with given total atom number and magnetization .",
    "we studied the effect of the non - zero temperature on the scaling law for the number of domains created via the kibble - urek mechanism in antiferromagnetic spinor condensates .",
    "the effect of the finite temperature is visible on the evolution of the gas density .",
    "we find the density to be more `` fuzzy '' but the number of created domains and their properties rather unaffected by the temperature .",
    "this result in a relatively low temperature shows the strength of the conservation law , namely the conservation of magnetization in our system that enforce the scaling law .",
    "in addition to the main result , we observed relaxation of the antiferromagnetic initial state to a thermal - like equilibrium .",
