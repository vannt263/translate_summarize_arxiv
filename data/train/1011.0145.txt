    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are widely thought to be one important kind of cosmic ray ( cr ) sources in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the most direct evidence comes from high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from snrs .",
    "generally there are two types of scenarios for production of high energy @xmath0-rays : the leptonic ( via inverse compton scattering of background photos by relativistic electrons ) and hadronic ( via decay of neutral pions produced by elastic collisions of relativistic ions with ions in the background plasma ) origins .",
    "understanding which of these two scenarios is dominant in specific sources is very important for the search of cr nuclei sources and the study of cr acceleration @xcite .",
    "usually it is difficult to distinguish the leptonic model and hadronic model just with the high energy @xmath0-ray data alone .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of photon emission from snrs can provide us key information about the radiation mechanism .",
    "shell - type snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 is one of the most widely studied snrs with perhaps the best multi - wavelength observations . the observational data span from radio @xcite , infrared , x - ray , gev @xmath0-ray @xcite , to tev @xmath0-ray band .",
    "recent observations , especially the x - ray emission detected by @xmath5 @xcite and tev @xmath0-ray emission measured by @xmath6 , give the energy spectra and images of this snr with very high quality , which makes detailed modelings of the emission mechanism plausible . the newly reported data from @xmath7 @xcite also set strict constraints on the nature of the radiation from this snr .",
    "basic results of recent studies of this snr may be summarized briefly as the following .",
    "the wide range tev @xmath0-ray spectrum favors a hadronic origin of the high energy emission .",
    "this scenario is also in line with the long standing view that snrs are the most important cr accelerators @xcite .",
    "however , there is a strong correlation between the x - ray image and tev @xmath0-ray image , favoring a leptonic origin of the multi - wavelength emission . @xcite",
    "also claims that the lack of spatial correlation between @xmath0-rays and the molecular cloud in the vicinity of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 argues against the hadronic scenario .",
    "furthermore the lack of thermal line emission on the x - ray spectrum sets an upper limit on the ambient plasma density of about @xmath8 @xmath3 , which implies a very high energy content of accelerated protons from the supernova explosion .",
    "the hadronic model actually has a proton acceleration efficiency more than 4 orders of magnitude higher than the electron acceleration efficiency , which corresponds to a rather extreme scenario @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the leptonic model can reproduce the multi - wavelength data and the model parameters can be easily accommodated by typical snrs @xcite though the overall fit to the data is relatively poor for the simplest cases .",
    "the spectral fit can be improved by considering details of electron acceleration near the high energy cutoff .",
    "in fact , the cutoff of the tev spectrum at a few tens of tev favors the leptonic model since production of photons at even higher energies through inverse comptonization of the cosmic microwave radiation by tev electrons is in the klein - nishina regime and therefore very inefficient @xcite .",
    "the observed decay of bright x - ray filaments with a width of @xmath9 lyr on a timescale of @xmath10 year , on the other hand , can be attributed to fast diffusion of high energy electrons in a weak magnetic field away from intermittently formed regions of relatively high accelerated electron density @xcite .",
    "it is evident that even with both theoretical and observational advances on this source recently , the nature of the tev emission is still inconclusive .",
    "the multi - wavelength observational data justifies a systematic modeling of the emission spectrum .",
    "moreover , the thermal emission needs to be taken into account to get more quantitative constraints .",
    "this paper focuses on these two aspects .",
    "studied the goodness - of - fit for various physically motivated leptonic models and found that the diffusive shock acceleration and the stochastic acceleration give comparably good fits . in this work",
    "we generalize this analysis by including the hadronic component .",
    "we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to constrain the model parameters , and investigate the full , correlated parameter space systematically .",
    "the non - thermal spectra of cr electrons and/or protons are parameterized in the simplest way , i.e. , a power law with a high - energy cutoff . the thermal bremmstrahlung radiation and line emission of the background plasma",
    "are also taken into account in the fit .",
    "we consider three scenarios for the @xmath0-ray emission , the purely leptonic model , the hadronic model and a hybrid model where the number of model parameters is reduced by requiring the spectral parameters of cr protons and electrons are identical except the normalization ( see sec .",
    "2 . below ) .",
    "the fitting results are presented in section 2 and show consistency with previous studies .",
    "the conclusion is drawn in section 3 , where we also discuss possible future researches necessary to improve our understanding of this source .",
    "in this section , we use the mcmc technique to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the mcmc method is well suitable for high dimensional parameter space investigation .",
    "the metropolis - hastings algorithm is used when sampling the model parameters .",
    "the probability density distributions of the model parameters can also be simply approximated by the number density of the sample points .",
    "a brief introduction to the basic procedure of the mcmc sampling can be found in . for more details about the mcmc method",
    ", please refer to @xcite .",
    "we also discuss implications of model parameters from the best fits to multi - wavelength data of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 for three scenarios of the @xmath0-ray emission . in all these scenarios , the radio to x - ray emissions",
    "are generated through synchrotron of relativistic electrons .",
    "the high energy @xmath0-rays are produced with different mechanisms .",
    "the basic physical parameters of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 are adopted as : age @xmath11 yr , distance @xmath12 kpc , and radius @xmath13 pc , and we assume a uniform emission sphere with a radius of @xmath14 in deriving related quantities .",
    "although the errors of the fermi data are large , we still include these data in the spectral fits @xcite . the procedure described in this paper",
    "can be applied to future observations with improved data to evaluate different emission models .      in the leptonic scenario",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission is produced through inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of energetic electrons off the background radiation field , including the interstellar infrared , optical radiation , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of accelerated electrons is prescribed as @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the electron energy , power law spectral index , high - energy cutoff energy , respectively , and @xmath19 describes the sharpness of this cutoff .",
    "the normalization is given through the total energy of electrons above 1 gev , @xmath20 .",
    "the synchrotron radiation also depends on the magnetic field strength @xmath21 .    the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) other than the cmb may be important for the calculation of ic @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the inclusion of isrf has been proposed to improve the fit to the @xmath6 data @xcite .",
    "however , given the new data of x - ray by @xmath5 and tev @xmath0-ray by @xmath6 , it was shown that only if the intensity of isrf is artificially boosted by more than one order of magnitude , the goodness - of - fit can be improved significantly @xcite . in this work",
    "the isrf is adopted as that given by @xcite at a distance of @xmath22 kpc from the galactic center and in the equatorial plane of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "our results are not sensitive to details of the isrf .",
    "thermal x - ray emission mostly depends on the density of the shocked interstellar medium ( ism ) @xmath23 and the temperature of background electrons @xmath24 .",
    "depending on the effect of accelerated particles on the shock structure , the density is a factor of a few higher than the density in the un - shocked upstream region @xcite .",
    "the electron temperature due to coulomb collisional energy exchange with ions is estimated by @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the temperature of background ions .",
    "@xmath26 is estimated to be higher than @xmath27 k if the background is heated by the shock @xcite . for @xmath28 @xmath3 , @xmath24 should be higher than @xmath29 k. alternatively proposed that the post - shock region temperature could be reduced significantly in the case of large mach number of the shock and effective particle acceleration",
    ". if this is the case , as we will show below , the constraint on the density and therefore the relativistic proton energy in the hadronic and hybrid models will be less strict .",
    "however , there are still significant uncertainties in the plasma heating downstream @xcite , and it was also argued that such an extreme condition was not easy to meet and the post - shock plasma should be heated more strongly @xcite . since there is no direct constraint on @xmath24 due to the lack of thermal emission , instead of including @xmath24 in the mcmc fit , we take some typical values of @xmath24 . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the background electrons are in ionization equilibrium with the background ions and use the raymond - smith plasma code to calculate the thermal emission for given @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the metalicity @xcite .",

    "the 2@xmath1 upper limit of @xmath23 is less than 0.03 @xmath3 , which is consistent with that obtained by from _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "since the discovery of synchrotron x - ray emission from the forward shock of sn 1006 @xcite , it has been established that shocks of snrs can accelerate electrons to tens of tev .",
    "the detection of tev emission directly from a few shell type snrs confirmed this conclusion @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the tev emission is still a matter of debate .",
    "x - ray observations also reveal strong thermal emission in the interior of a few young snrs .",
    "thermal x - ray emission from the forward shock , on the other hand , is usually weak and only detected in relatively old remnants , such as rcw 86 @xcite .",
    "since the observed tev emission is well correlated with the forward shock , the lack of thermal x - ray emission implies low gas density and therefore high energy content of accelerated protons in the hadronic model for the tev emission , which is difficult to accommodate with the snr theories .",
    "the leptonic model in general gives a poorer fit to the tev spectrum than the hadronic model .",
    "more detailed modeling is necessary to distinguish these emission models .    using the mcmc method ,",
    "we systematically investigate the parameter space of models for the multi - wavelength emission of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the high quality of observational data , especially x - ray data from @xmath5 and tev @xmath0-ray data from @xmath6 , enables us to get very good constraints on most model parameters and better understand the emission mechanisms .",
    "the radio and x - ray emissions are thought to be produced by the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons accelerated in the snr .",
    "the high energy @xmath0-ray emission ( from gev to tev ) can be produced through the ic radiation of electrons scattering off background low energy photons , and/or the decay of @xmath91 generated through cr proton - ism collisions .",
    "we study three kinds of scenarios , the leptonic one , hadronic one and a hybrid one , distinguished through the emission mechanism of high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "thermal emissions , including continuous and line emissions , are included in the modeling to constrain density of the background plasma with the absence of thermal emission in x - ray observations .",
    "the global fit of these three scenarios shows that : 1 ) the goodness - of - fit is the worst for the leptonic model and the best for the hadronic model ; 2 ) the x - ray data can set an upper limit on the background ism density , which is @xmath92 @xmath3 depending on the temperature of the background electrons ; 3 ) the upper limit of @xmath23 leads to a lower limit of energy content of relativistic protons @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) erg for the hybrid ( hadronic ) model , which seems to be too high for a typical core - collapse supernova .",
    "the well constrained parameters of the leptonic scenario are more physically acceptable , although the hybrid and hadronic scenarios give smaller @xmath4 values .",
    "in some physically motivated models of electron acceleration in snr , the goodness - of - fit can be improved , and our overall results appear to favor the leptonic scenario @xcite .",
    "however , systematic errors in the x - ray and tev band are significant in all the emission models studied so far , which demands more advanced modeling . for example , the observed source structure is much richer than the simple uniform zone assumed in all the emission models . on the other hand ,",
    "given difficulties in x - ray and tev observations , the errors of the relevant data may also be underestimated , especially the @xmath6 fluxes at the low energy range , which does not appear to smoothly match the recently obtained gev fluxes with the _ fermi _ observatory @xcite .    in the following",
    "we discuss several possible alternatives of the hadronic scenario , in order to provide an independent judge of the price needed to pay to keep the hadronic model working .",
    "the most serious challenge to the hadronic and hybrid models is the high energy content of relativistic protons inferred from the upper limit of the background density .",
    "this high energy content is in excess of typical supernova explosions , but could be explained by hypernovae .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the snr with a shock speed @xmath95 may be estimated as @xmath96 with the current best estimate of the distance at 1kpc , the radius of the remnant is 10pc .",
    "for such a remnant size , the total kinetic energy content ( @xmath97 ) of the remnant is much less than typical hypernovae and less than the energy content of relativistic protons .",
    "however , the distance to the snr is not well determined .",
    "the lack of thermal x - ray emission directly constrains the integration along the line - of - sight of the thermal emissivity , which is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "the radius @xmath14 and shock speed @xmath95 of the snr scales linearly with the distance @xmath99 .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath23 therefore is proportional to @xmath100 ; @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux produced via hadronic process is proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath61 therefore is proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the snr decreases more rapidly than @xmath61 , making the discrepancy between these two energies worse for shorter distance @xmath99 .",
    "an increase of @xmath99 by a factor of 3 , on the other hand , can make the upper limit on @xmath61 less than @xmath97 , which is now @xmath104 erg , at the high end of observed hypernovae .",
    "this may explain the rareness of this kind of shell type tev snrs with non - detection of thermal x - ray emission .",
    "for the few tens of snrs observed in x - rays , two of them show complete absence of thermal emission @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of proton acceleration also needs to be greater than @xmath105 for this model to work @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the density is then about @xmath8 @xmath3 , which is not too different from values obtained above and from previous studies .",
    "alternatively , the hadronic and hybrid models can work by overcoming the upper limit on the ism density placed by the upper limit on the thermal electron emission .",
    "this limit arises from using the standard ion - electron coupling term from @xcite producing a lower limit on the electron temperature ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) . but",
    "this assumed a standard profile for the remnant .",
    "if the emission of this remnant is instead produced by the interaction of the supernova shock striking a thin shell of material ejected from the star prior to collapse ( e.g. an outburst from a luminous blue variable or binary mass ejection ) , the electrons might still be cold .",
    "however , to do so would require very fine - tuned arguments ( for the electron temperature to be below @xmath106k , the shock must have hit the stellar ejecta less than 25yr ago ) .",
    "even with this fine - tuning , this thin shell of material would not have a large enough emitting volume to explain the observed high - energy emission .",
    "a thin shell explanation seems unlikely .",
    "it was also suggested that the effective particle acceleration would make the post - shock medium be less heated , however , the extreme condition in such a scenario seems difficult to satisfy , and the non - linear effects will also make the medium be heated more significantly @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation of the low inferred density of the background plasma is the assumption of ionization equilibrium adopted in calculating the thermal emission , which however may not be valid . for the case with a large fraction of neutral medium , @xmath107 , the constraint on @xmath23 from the thermal emission , which is proportional to @xmath108 , will be much weaker than the case with fully ionized gas",
    "therefore the requirement of @xmath61 can be smaller and the difference between @xmath61 and the power of typical supernova can be reduced . in such a case , the low density of ionized ism implies that neutral gases can penetrate a depth of @xmath109 before being ionized by the free electrons @xcite .",
    "for very low density of ionized plasma in the shocked downstream region , this depth can be a significant fraction of the radius of the remnant , and one may expect strong h@xmath110 emissions @xcite .",
    "better treatment of the ionization balance in the shock downstream may address this issue .",
    "finally we mention that neutrino signal can be used to test the hybrid / hadronic model of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "it is shown that if the tev @xmath0-rays are predominantly produced by hadronic interactions , the accompanied neutrino signal might be detected in the up - coming km@xmath111 neutrino detector , such as km3net .",
