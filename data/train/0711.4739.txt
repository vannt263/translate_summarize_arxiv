    "thus the new element of theorem  [ t2.1 ] is the converse direction ( ii ) @xmath73 @xmath74 ( i ) .",
    "it does not seem to us that the ideas in @xcite alone will provide that half .",
    "associated to each such @xmath55 is a natural isospectral torus : certain almost periodic jacobi matrices that lie in an @xmath48-dimensional torus .",
    "although the torus , @xmath53 , has been studied before ( e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) , many features are not explicit in the literature , so we wrote @xcite .",
    "we will need the proper analog of the  jost function \" for this situation .",

    "the other main result is the following :    t2.2 suppose @xmath22 is a jacobi matrix obeying the conditions  in @xmath55 . then there is a point @xmath88 so @xmath89 as @xmath90 .",

    "the limit in can also be described in terms of a suitable  jost function \" @xmath98 .",
    "when there are no bound states ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , this is a result of widom @xcite .",
    "yuditskii @xcite found a different proof relying on a machinery of sodin ",
    "yuditskii @xcite which allowed some bound states , and their note @xcite extended to .",
    "so this theorem is not new  what is new is our proof of it and the compact form of is new .",
    "one application that killip ",
    "simon @xcite make of theorem  [ t1.2 ] is to prove a conjecture of nevai @xcite that @xmath99 implies . for implies and a result of hundertmark ",
    "simon @xcite says implies .",
    "simon @xcite used theorem  [ t1.4 ] and a matrix version of @xcite to prove an analog of nevai s conjecture for perturbations of periodic jacobi matrices .",
    "this leads us to :    con2.3 suppose @xmath100 lies in @xmath53 and @xmath22 is a jacobi matrix obeying @xmath101 then the szeg condition , , holds .",
    "the issue is whether implies . that it holds for the eigenvalues above and below the spectrum is a result of frank ",
    "simon  weidl @xcite , but it remains unknown for eigenvalues in the gaps .",

    "thus , we have a corollary of theorem  [ t2.1 ] :    t2.4 if holds for some @xmath104 , then holds .    the big open question",
