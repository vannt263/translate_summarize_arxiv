    "coherent control of entangled@xcite and spin - polarized spin - pol , egues electrons is relevant for the emerging fields of spintronics @xcite and quantum computation.@xcite spin rotation of electron states is perhaps the simplest example of spin manipulation ; and yet , it constitutes a relevant operation for quantum processing and the design of novel spintronic devices .",
    "spin precession of electrically - injected carriers has recently been accomplished for diffusive transport in metallic wires;@xcite however , this basic operation is still challenging for transport in ballistic channels .    the rashba spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction,@xcite present in quantum - confined heterostructures lacking _ structural _ inversion symmetry , offers an interesting possibility to coherently rotate spin states in the _ absence _ of a magnetic field .",
    "this was first recognized by datta and das @xcite in their spin - transistor proposal .",
    "essential to this proposal is the electric control of the s - o interaction in ballistic one - dimensional channels.@xcite    we have recently proposed@xcite the use of a  `` local '' s - o rashba interaction as a means of modulating current and shot noise for spin - polarized and entangled electrons in novel beam - splitter geometries,@xcite fig .",
    "1 . the local rashba interaction acting within an extension @xmath0 of lead 1 allows for gate - controlled spin rotation of the incoming electrons.@xcite this s - o induced spin rotation produces continuous changes in the symmetry of the spin part of the wave function which in turn affects the orbital motion and hence transport properties such as current and its fluctuations .    here",
    "we present an alternate route to our shot noise calculation in a beam splitter with a local rashba interaction.@xcite we focus on triplet and singlet states only .",
    "we determine noise by first evolving the incoming electron states within lead 1 under the s - o interaction and then calculating the appropriate noise matrix elements involving these states .",
    "this less general approach allows us to determine shot noise in the presence of spin orbit straightforwardly in terms of the earlier results for bunching and antibunching in a beam - splitter geometry with no spin orbit.@xcite we consider incoming leads with one and two modes ; for the latter we also include a weak s - o induced interband coupling.@xcite for entangled singlet and triplet states , we find _ continuous _ bunching and antibunching behavior as a function of the s - o  induced phase .",
    "in addition , our calculation shows that unentangled and entangled triplets display _ distinctive _ shot noise ; this enhances the possibilities for entanglement detection schemes solely based on noise measurements .",
    "spin - orbit interband mixing induces a further modulation on the noise for triplets and singlet .",
    "this is due to the coherent transfer of carriers between the s - o coupled rashba bands as they traverse lead 1 .",
    "this additional spin rotation allows the design of a spin transistor with enhanced spin control.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) can be easily diagonalized .",

    "this is more easily seen by rewriting the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) in the basis of the @xmath19 problem . instead of diagonalizing the problem exactly , here we follow a more intuitive perturbative approach similar to that of the nearly - free electron model.@xcite for small interband couplings , we can approximate ( lowest order ) the energy dispersions near the crossing at @xmath36 ( fig .",
