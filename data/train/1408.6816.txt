    "despite many observational and theoretical efforts over the past thirty years , the population of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) remains a challenge of modern cosmology .",
    "galaxy formation and evolution is an extremely variegated discipline , involving complex `` internal '' processes , such as the transformation of gas into stars , feedback processes from , e.g. , active galactic nuclei and supernov , as well as `` external '' processes , such as interactions among galaxies and between galaxies and their environment ( e.g. ram - pressure stripping induced by the hot intra - cluster medium ) . despite this complexity , most of the observed properties of etgs appear very homogeneous , showing tight correlations with a single key observable , central velocity dispersion ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such correlations involve structural parameters ( namely , the scale radius and mean luminosity density within that radius ) , also known as fundamental plane relation  @xcite , as well as the underlying stellar populations ( e.g. age and chemical composition ) .    in the last twenty years",
    ", our knowledge of the stellar populations of etgs has advanced , thanks to improvements in the spectroscopic and photometric observations available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as advances in the theoretical modelling of unresolved stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is now widely accepted that both metallicity and the abundance of the @xmath2-elements ( in particular the ratio [ mg / fe ] ) increase with galaxy mass , the main driver of these correlations being the central velocity dispersion , @xmath1 ( i.e. the central potential well ) of a galaxy  @xcite , or its dynamical mass  @xcite .",
    "the stellar metallicity-@xmath1 relation can be understood because most of the massive systems retain more efficiently the heavy elements from exploding supernov  within their deeper potential well  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath2 elements are released during the explosion of short - lived massive stars ( type ii supernov ) , in contrast to iron , that is mainly produced by type ia supernov , the ratio [ @xmath2/fe ]  is believed to serve as a proxy of the star - formation time scale of a galaxy .",
    "therefore , the [ @xmath2/fe]-@xmath1 relation can be interpreted as a trend towards shorter , more efficient star formation in the most massive etgs  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . regarding stellar ages",
    ", early studies found no significant correlation with galaxy mass  ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while more recent works have found the age to increase with central velocity dispersion , especially at low velocity dispersion .",
    "the trends of age and metallicity with mass are not limited to the central regions of etgs , probed by spectroscopic studies , but also apply to their overall ( i.e. aperture - integrated ) stellar populations , as implied by the fp relation  @xcite .",
    "in addition to age , metallicity , and abundance ratios , the ( unresolved ) stellar populations of etgs have also been recently found to feature a varying stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , through the analysis of gravity - sensitive features in their spectra .",
    "a significant correlation is also found in place , between imf slope and velocity dispersion , with massive etgs having enhanced fractions of dwarf - to - giant stars with respect to a `` standard '' , kroupa - like imf  @xcite .",
    "although galaxy mass ( or more precisely , velocity dispersion ) is found to be the primary driver of the stellar population properties of etgs , these properties are also affected by the environment where galaxies reside .",
    "several studies have analysed the dependence of age , metallicity , and [ @xmath2/fe ] , on `` local '' environment , characterised either by the density of neighbouring galaxies , the distance to the centre of the host group / cluster , or by splitting galaxies into those residing in galaxy groups and those in the `` field '' ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these works have all found that galaxies in low - density regions have younger luminosity - weighted ages than their cluster counterparts , with age differences of @xmath5@xmath6  gyr ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such differences also exist when considering etgs in high - density , low - velocity dispersion systems , such as the hickson compact groups  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , discordant results have been reported in the literature regarding trends between environment and metallicity .",
    "@xcite found no detectable difference in the metallicity of field and cluster etgs , whereas other studies , e.g.  @xcite found evidence for galaxies in dense environments to be less metal rich than those in the field .",
    "one possible cause of these discrepancies is the significant dependence of the internal metallicity gradients of etgs on environment ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , with different studies targeting different apertures for the stellar population analysis .",
    "the environmental dependence of [ @xmath2/fe ]  has been addressed less frequently in the literature than age and metallicity trends , mostly because of the lack of stellar population models , based on _ empirical _ stellar libraries that cover a range in age , metallicity , and [ @xmath2/fe ] .",
    "@xcite found etgs at high density to be more @xmath2-enhanced than those at low density , indicative of a shorter formation time scale of their stars .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of `` rejuvenated '' objects , having young ages and lower [ @xmath2/fe ] , increases from high- to low - density regions .",
    "however , these trends with environment are biased by galaxy stellar mass , as it is well known that more massive galaxies inhabit denser regions of the universe @xcite .",
    "such a coupling between galaxy stellar mass and environment has to be carefully taken into account in order to single out the effects of environment alone ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although local density is an intuitive way to describe the environment where a galaxy resides , it is not necessarily the most effective way to characterise it . in the current picture",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , two main paths of galaxy formation and evolution can be envisioned .",
    "galaxies can be either `` centrals '' in a surrounding dark - matter halo , or `` satellites '' , being accreted onto the halo during its hierarchical build - up .",
    "centrals can keep accreting hot gas from the halos they are embedded in , whereas satellites are believed to be deprived of their gas reservoir by their host halo .",
    "therefore , splitting galaxies into centrals and satellites is a more natural way to compare observations and theory .",
    "another interesting approach to characterise the environment is that of using the shape of the velocity distribution of galaxies in a group ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . despite the fact that several studies have analysed the dependence of stellar populations of etgs on local environment",
    ", there has been no detailed stellar population study of the two populations of satellite and central etgs individually .",
    "this is indeed the main focus of the present work . by analysing stacked spectra obtained from a large sample of morphologically selected etgs from the sdss - based spider survey  @xcite ,",
    "we explore how the stellar populations of central and satellite etgs  namely the age , metallicity , [ @xmath2/fe ] , and internal extinction  depend on the `` global '' environment ( i.e. the mass of the parent halo ) where they reside .",
    "we compare galaxy properties at fixed velocity dispersion , in order to single out the effect of galaxy mass and environment .",
    "the present analysis complements  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pgf10 ) , differing from it in several regards : ( i ) we analyse here only the population of morphologically selected etgs ; ( ii ) the properties of galaxies are compared at fixed velocity dispersion , rather than fixed galaxy stellar mass ; ( iii ) we study here also the environmental dependence of [ @xmath2/fe ]  and internal extinction , in addition to age and metallicity ( as in pgf10 ) . throughout the present work ,",

    "is believed to be suppressed by feedback processes ( e.g. agn activity ) , in order to explain the old stellar ages and low - level of recent star - formation in massive galaxies at low redshift @xcite .",
    "the more prolonged smfhs of centrals in high - mass halos might be due to a stronger accretion of hot gas from the surrounding halo .",
    "however , the gas should also cool down to sit into the central galaxy itself to form a disc ( preserving its angular momentum ) . since our sample is selected to minimise the contamination from systems with a disk component ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] ) , we would expect this scenario to be ruled out .",
    "instead , we interpret our findings as the result of gas - rich galaxy - galaxy interactions , between centrals residing in present - day groups , and the population of infalling satellites .",
    "these interactions are certainly more important in groups , than in `` isolated '' ellipticals ( where , by definition , there are fewer satellites , see fig .  [ fig : hmass_hist ] ) . in this framework ,",
    "dissipative interactions should have been an essential ingredient of the mass accretion history of central etgs in groups .",
    "in fact , major ( minor ) `` dry '' ( dissipation - less ) mergers are expected to increase ( not change ) the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "assuming that the trends for `` isolated '' centrals at low redshift are representative of those of the progenitors of central etgs in more massive groups today , major dry mergers would lead to a horizontal shift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cen_sl ] ) towards higher @xmath1 of _ all _ stellar population trends regarding central etgs . while the trends for @xmath121 , [ @xmath2/fe ] , and @xmath131   are consistent with this scenario , the trends for metallicity are not . on the other hand , simulations suggest that gas - rich interactions can produce a significant dilution of metallicity only during the first phases of the interaction , especially for intense levels of star - formation , after which enrichment becomes the dominant effect , so that metallicity is expected to be larger in the final system than in the progenitors  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism goes in the direction of increasing the metallicity of centrals in more massive halos , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cen_sl ] .",
    "therefore , the results of this work point consistently to a picture whereby central etgs in groups evolve through a higher number of gas - rich galaxy - galaxy interactions , resulting in slightly more extended star formation histories with respect to `` isolated '' etgs  although the `` local '' physics , parameterised as central velocity dispersion , remains the main driver of star formation in etgs , a result that is consistent with the properties of star forming galaxies as well ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also worth emphasising that the subtle but consistent differences found between the stellar populations in central and satellite etgs confirm that a central / satellite split is the key property that allows us to understand in detail the effect of environment on galaxy formation .",
