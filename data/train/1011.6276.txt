    "the evolution of a population in an inhomogeneous environment with spatially varying growth rates can display complex dynamical patterns , resulting from the competition between diffusion , random multiplication and possibly advection @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities of the environment can greatly affect the population dynamics resulting in anomalous spreading ( neither diffusive , nor ballistic ) and intermittent behaviors ( for a review on intermittency in random media see , e.g. , @xcite ) with patches of population growing in favorable places and being surrounded by large desertic regions .",
    "diffusion tails play the role of vanguard agents that explore hostile regions , in search of ever - more hospitable locations to settle and to multiply .",
    "the offspring in the new settlement will eventually outgrow the original colony and generate a strong gradient current : this can be seen as a migration of the whole population .",
    "a simple and concrete example of this problem is provided by bacteria multiplying and diffusing in a petri dish where nutrients and inhibitors are unevenly distributed , resulting in complex growth patterns that are observable in actual experiments @xcite . in a more abstract",
    "setting , the actual inhomogeneous space can be replaced by a rough phenotypic landscape in which the fitness functional ( that governs the growth rate ) takes different values : here the coordinate variable does not label a spatial location but rather the genetic content of each individual .",
    "this point of view has been inspired by s. wright , r. a. fisher and j. b. s. haldane s classical studies in population genetic @xcite .",
    "more recently it was developed by m. eigen @xcite as a model for punctuated evolution of quasi - species and has been further investigated by w. ebeling et al .",

    "we examine a population of non - interacting particles that diffuse and undergo the birth / death process depending on the availability of nutrients .",
    "the population density @xmath0 evolves according to the diffusion equation with a multiplicative noise : @xmath1    the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 is assumed to be uniform , while the birth / death rate @xmath3 is inhomogeneous .",
    "we shall focus on the simplest case of the stationary noise , @xmath4 , and investigate how spatial correlations of the noise affect the growth rate of @xmath0 .",
    "the langevin equation is linear , reflecting the basic assumption that particles do not interact .",
    "the noise @xmath3 is known through its stochastic properties and changing these properties may drastically affect the behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "equation can be generalized in various ways , e.g. one can take into account advection @xcite , study the evolution of a vector field in a random background ( e.g. a magnetic field in the dynamo effect ) @xcite , or consider several coupled fields as in the case of chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "one can introduce a non - linearity in order to take into account saturation effects @xcite . besides",
    ", it can also be interesting to consider situations with @xmath5 , the dependence on time reflecting e.g. seasonal variations .    although we shall chiefly employ a population dynamics vocabulary ( particles , nutrients , migrations ) , it is useful to keep in mind that the stochastic partial differential equation   arises in many different contexts . in chemical physics , reaction kinetics",
    "is often modeled by equations similar to eq .   and",
    "these equations allow to predict macroscopic patterns in the spatial distribution of reagents @xcite .",
    "when the amplification rate @xmath6 takes only negative values , equation   describes non - interacting particles that diffuse in a medium with random absorption . in the extreme case of @xmath7 with random positions @xmath8 of the traps ,",
    "the trapping sites become perfect because @xmath9 has to vanish for @xmath10 .",
    "( more precisely , the above formulation applies in one dimension ; in higher dimensions , the traps should be finite and absorbing conditions are set on the boundaries of the traps . )",
    "the literature on this classical subject is vast ; one of the most celebrated results asserts that the density decreases according to a stretched exponential law : @xmath11 in @xmath12 dimensions @xcite",
    ".    another important interpretation of equation   in terms of polymer dynamics can be obtained from its formal solution , @xmath13 where the green function @xmath14 is given by the feynman - kac formula @xcite @xmath15 \\right).\\ ] ] the expectation value @xmath16 with respect to the wiener measure is taken over all paths @xmath17 that begin at @xmath18 at @xmath19 and end at @xmath20 at time @xmath21 .",
    "this formula can be rewritten in more familiar manner as a path integral @xmath22\\right\\ }   .\\ ] ] it is then natural to interpret @xmath17 as a @xmath12-dimensional gaussian polymer in the random potential @xmath3 @xcite , or as a @xmath23-dimensional _ directed _ polymer with columnar disorder @xcite ( for a review on directed polymers see @xcite ) .",
    "the physics of directed polymers in a random medium is closely related to the growth of random surfaces . in one dimension , for instance",
    ", we write @xmath24 and recast into @xmath25 . differentiating this equation with respect to @xmath26 and writing @xmath27",
    "we obtain @xmath28 thus after the transformation the noise becomes additive , but the governing eq .",
    "is now a _ non - linear _ stochastic partial differential equation .",
    "the langevin equation   formally resembles the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite , yet the noise @xmath29 in equation is stationary , whereas in the kpz equation the noise depends both on space _ and _ time .",
    "[ in the kpz equation , the noise is typically taken to be the gaussian white noise , @xmath30 .",
    "] hence the physical properties of the solutions to eq .   are significantly different from those of the standard kpz equation @xcite",
    ".    equation   can also be viewed as a schrdinger equation in imaginary time and with a random potential ; it is thus related to the physics of localization @xcite . in the present study",
    "@xmath9 is a density of particles ( not a wave - function ) .",
    "for instance , in the no - noise case the total mass @xmath31 is conserved , whereas the analogous integral in the quantum case is not conserved .",
    "furthermore , we are not directly interested in eigenstates of   but rather in the temporal behavior of its solution starting from a localized initial state .",
    "all these differences explain why the phenomenology is rather different from that of localization , although some of the techniques developed to study quantum disordered systems are useful in the analysis of eq .  .",
    "the behavior of solutions of the apparently simple linear langevin equation is not yet fully understood due to a number of puzzling features .",
    "one such feature is an astonishingly fast growth ( and sometimes a blow up that occurs in a finite time , or even instantaneously @xcite ) .",
    "there are a few causes of these striking behaviors :    * the noise is multiplicative . * in many simple models , the noise is unbounded .",
    "hence , the regions with large positive @xmath32 play a dominant role and lead to a counter - intuitive super - exponential growth . in this situation , the discretized ( in space ) versions of eq .",
    "differ drastically from the strictly continuous version .",
    "* the lack of self - averaging which is manifested by the huge difference between _ average _ and _ typical _ behaviors .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyze the langevin equation   when the noise is strongly correlated in space .",
    "some of our results are presented in table  [ tablesynthese ] where we display only the scaling laws ( numerical constants will be given throughout the text ) .",
    "the part of table  [ tablesynthese ] describing the asymptotic growth laws for the uncorrelated gaussian white noise summarizes previous work .",
    "the notion of `` correlated '' noise is of course a bit vague .",
    "the one - dimensional case is exceptional as the very natural assumption that the _ increments _ of the noise are uncorrelated leads to the correlated noise @xmath6 which is essentially a trajectory of a random walk ( in the lattice setting ) or a brownian motion ( in a continuum setting ) , with @xmath26 playing a role to time .",
    "table  [ tablesynthese ] presents the asymptotic growth laws corresponding to such a noise .",
    "( our main higher - dimensional results are collected in table  [ tablehighdim ] . )",
    ".asymptotic growth laws for some of the population dynamics ( numerical factors are omitted ) .",
    "the noise is assumed to be gaussian , apart from the case when the noise forms a random walk landscape , that is , the increment of the noise are bounded .",
    "( the uncorrelated bounded noise is investigated in sect .",
    "[ bounded ] . ) the results for the correlated noise in higher dimensions are discussed in sect .",
    "[ 2d : corr ] . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a similar reasoning can be carried out in higher dimensions . in order to estimate the average growth we again need to know the distribution of the maximum .",
    "proceeding as above we find that in three dimensions , the spherically symmetric optimal landscape satisfies @xmath33 with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "this leads to @xmath35 ( taking again the microscopic cut - off to be unity ) .",
    "the corresponding weight behaves as @xmath36 ; there is no dependence on @xmath37 because the interface is flat at large scales . using this expression for the maximum distribution ,",
    "we obtain the average growth of the population @xmath38 \\ , .\\ ] ] in three dimensions . maximizing with respect to @xmath39 we arrive at @xmath40 note that we do not need to optimize with respect to @xmath37 because the distribution of @xmath39 , for large values of @xmath39 , is independent of @xmath37 . a similar reasoning",
    "can be carried out in higher dimensions and we find that the behavior is also given by for all @xmath41 .",
    "table  [ tablehighdim ] summarizes our results for the typical and the average population growth in the situation when the random landscape is described by a gaussian free field .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the evolution of a population of non - interacting particles that undergo diffusion and birth / death .",
    "the latter depends on the environment , for example , the distribution of nutrients that defines a landscape which is assumed to be stationary .",
    "different statistical properties of this landscape lead to a number of laws for the growth of the population . in most of the cases , the total population increases in a faster - than - exponential manner .",
    "this behavior is due to two features of the noise , namely its multiplicative nature and the lack of upper bound .",
    "another striking feature is the huge difference between typical and average behaviors . in order to determine the average growth law",
    ", one has to consider all possible realizations of the random landscape and the average is dominated by very rare configurations .",
    "thus extremal statistics play an important role .",
    "some of our analysis relies on heuristic arguments . in one dimension",
    "we have performed asymptotically exact calculations in the situation where the noise is described by a brownian process .",
    "we have shown that the determination of the average population growth reduces to calculating a first passage exponential functional of the brownian motion .",
    "this problem can be solved by using the backward fokker - planck equation .",
    "the asymptotically exact results agree with heuristic predictions .",
    "although the basic stochastic differential equation has been studied for almost thirty years , there are still many open problems . even in one dimension",
    ", it would be interesting to generalize the quantitative approach applicable to the brownian landscape to other random landscapes such as those generated by a fractional brownian motion . in higher dimensions ( @xmath42 )",
    ", little is rigorously and/or exactly known . to appreciate the challenge",
    ", one can think of the somewhat related problem of the localization of a quantum particle .    on a more practical side",
    ", it could be interesting to study the transient regime when the system is still far from the final asymptotic stage . in the long time",
    "limit , non - linear saturation effects , that are ignored in our model , can start playing a prominent role . adding nonlinear terms to the basic equation",
    "will totally modify its properties in the asymptotic regime .",
    "this is a challenging mathematical problem that deserves further analysis .",
