    "we denote by @xmath0 the space of symmetric tensors on @xmath4 ; such tensors can be identified with homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath5 in @xmath6 variables , which are also referred to as _ forms_. in this symmetric setting , the most natural tensor rank decomposition is the classical waring decomposition , which expresses a symmetric tensor as a sum of powers of linear forms .",
    "precisely , every form @xmath7 has a minimal expression @xmath8 where @xmath9 are linear forms @xcite ; the minimal number of summands @xmath1 is called the symmetric rank of @xmath10 , since in the correspondence between forms and symmetric tensors , powers of linear forms correspond to tensors of rank @xmath11 .",
    "a natural question concerns the number of summands required for representing a general form in @xmath12 .",
    "this problem is elementary for @xmath13 , which corresponds to the case of symmetric matrices . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the question was answered by alexander and hirschowitz in @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath15 they proved that the general @xmath7 with @xmath16 has rank @xmath17 , which is called the _ generic rank _ , unless the space @xmath12 is one of the so - called defective cases @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the generic rank is @xmath21 .",
    "when the rank of a waring decomposition is strictly smaller than @xmath22 , we say that this decomposition is of _ subgeneric rank_. it is worth noting that , in our notation , being of _ subgeneric rank _ is not always equivalent to being of _ rank smaller than the one of a general tensor _ , because in the defective cases above a general tensor has rank strictly bigger than @xmath22 .",
    "the alexander ",
    "hirschowitz theorem implies that the generic tensor of subgeneric rank admits only a finite number of alternative waring decompositions @xcite . in this paper , we shall be concerned with proving that the is an element of the @xmath1-secant variety of the veronese variety @xmath23 , which is an irreducible variety @xcite , this terminology is warranted . ]",
    "generic tensor of fixed subgeneric rank admits precisely one waring decomposition , modulo permutations of the summands and scaling by @xmath5-roots of unity .",
    "more precisely , the main result of this paper is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm_main ] let @xmath16 .",
    "the general tensor in @xmath0 of subgeneric rank @xmath24 with @xmath22 as in ( [ eqn_exp_rank ] ) has a _",

    "the three exceptional cases were already known in the literature .",
    "the first two cases are classical ; see remark 4.4 in @xcite and remark 6.5 in @xcite .",
    "the third case was recently found by ranestad and voisin ; see the proof of lemma 4.3 in @xcite .",
    "a uniform treatment of these cases is presented in proposition [ prop : n235 ] .",
    "our original contribution establishes that there are no more exceptions to identifiability for cubics .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm_main ] is based on the study of the geometric concepts of _ weak defectivity _ , developed in @xcite , and _ tangentially weak defectivity _ , developed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , from this point of view , the theorem can be reformulated in the following way , which is a result of independent interest .",
    "[ thm_main2 ] let @xmath16 , @xmath22 as in ( [ eqn_exp_rank ] ) , and @xmath24 .",
    "then , the common singular locus of the space of hypersurfaces of degree @xmath5 in @xmath32 that are singular at @xmath1 general points , consists of exactly these @xmath1 points , except in the following cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the unique sextic plane curve singular at @xmath33 general points is a double cubic , so that its singular locus is an elliptic cubic curve ; 2 .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the net of quartic surfaces singular at @xmath34 points consists of reducible quadrics , so that the common singular locus is the base locus of the pencil of quadrics through @xmath34 general points , which is an elliptic normal curve of degree @xmath35 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath31 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the common singular locus of the pencil of cubic 4-folds singular at @xmath33 general points is the unique elliptic normal curve of degree @xmath36 through these @xmath33 points .",
    "furthermore , the above exceptional cases are the only instances where there exists a unique elliptic normal curve of degree @xmath6 in @xmath32 through @xmath1 general points .    in this formulation ,",
    "the theorem was already partially proved : the case @xmath37 was proved by chiantini and ciliberto @xcite ; for @xmath3 it was proved by ballico ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) ; and for @xmath38 with @xmath39 it was proved by mella ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "consequently , the original contribution of this paper concerns the case of cubics , i.e. , @xmath2 , which we solve completely in the subgeneric case .",
    "this answers the question posed in remark 4.4 in @xcite .",
    "we notice that ballico @xcite proved an even stronger result for @xmath3 .",
    "namely , he showed that a general hypersurface of degree @xmath3 in @xmath32 that is singular in @xmath1 general points , is singular only at these @xmath1 points ( except for the exceptional cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of theorem [ thm_main2 ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the veronese variety @xmath23 is not @xmath1-weakly defective , while our result only says that it is not _",
    "@xmath1-tangentially _ weakly defective .",
    "we wonder whether the above list also gives the classification of all @xmath1-weakly defective veronese varieties @xmath23 , even for @xmath2 .",
    "symmetric tensors of general rank are not expected to admit only a finite number of waring decompositions , because the expected dimension @xmath40 of the @xmath17-secant variety of the veronese variety @xmath23 may exceed the dimension @xmath41 of the embedding space @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , at least a curve s worth of alternative waring decompositions of a general symmetric tensor is anticipated in these cases . however ,",
    "if @xmath42 is integer , then a general symmetric tensor is still expected to admit only a finite number of waring decompositions .",
    "the approach pursued in this paper , i.e. , proving not tangential weak defectivity , can not handle tensors of the generic rank .",
    "other approaches need to be considered in this setting .",
    "in fact , mella @xcite formulated a conjecture about the cases where the expression in ( [ eq : waring ] ) is still expected to be unique even for general symmetric tensors . in @xcite , further evidence for this conjecture was given ; in addition , the analogous problem for nonsymmetric tensors was also considered .",
    "even though the general symmetric tensor is not of subgeneric rank , the setting considered in this paper is nevertheless important in applications where one is mostly interested in the identifiability of symmetric tensors of subgeneric rank .",
    "for instance ,",
    "anandkumar , ge , hsu , kakade , and telgarsky @xcite consider statistical parameter inference algorithms based on decomposing symmetric tensors for a wide class of latent variable models .",
    "the identifiability of the waring decomposition then ensures that the recovered parameters , which correspond with the individual symmetric rank-@xmath11 terms in waring s decomposition , are unique , and , thus , admit an interpretation in the application domain .",
    "the rank of the waring decomposition , in these applications , is invariably much smaller than the generic rank . as general sources on tensor decomposition ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in analogy to theorem [ thm_main ] , we mention that the results in @xcite give broad evidence to the analogous problem in the setting of nonsymmetric tensors , i.e. , that a general nonsymmetric tensor of subgeneric rank admits a unique tensor rank decomposition , unless it is one of the exceptional cases that have already been proved in @xcite .    in the proofs by induction of several theorems , we rely on the software macaulay2 @xcite for proving the base cases .",
    "the two scripts we used are available as ancillary files in the arxiv submission of this paper .",
    "the content of the paper is the following .",
    "in section [ sec : newexample ] , we present a uniform treatment of the exceptional cases appearing in theorems [ thm_main ] and [ thm_main2 ] .",
    "remark [ rem : genesis ] also discusses our initial motivation for studying the topic of this paper .",
    "section [ sec : cubics ] contains the proof of the main theorem .",
    "thereafter , the connection between weakly defective varieties and the dual varieties to secant varieties , including a description of the dual varieties of all weakly defective examples appearing in theorem [ thm_main2 ] , is explored in section [ sec : dual ] .",
    "in particular , theorem [ thm : dualveronese ] contains the description of cubic hypersurfaces in @xmath43 that can be written as the determinant of a @xmath44 matrix with linear entries . in section [ sec : algorithm ] , we give an explicit criterion allowing to check if a given waring decomposition is unique .",
