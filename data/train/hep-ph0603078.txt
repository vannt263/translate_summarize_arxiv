    "cross sections for neutrino - nucleon reactions were among the first predictions of the standard model of electroweak interactions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being one of the first test cases of the standard model , these reactions play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of the core - collapse supernovae  @xcite .",
    "neutrino interactions control not only the dynamics of core - collapse supernovae , but also the yields of the r - process nucleosynthesis that could take place in such environments  @xcite .",
    "neutrino - nucleon interactions also contribute to the energy transfer from the accretion - disk neutrinos to the nucleons in models of gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "finally , understanding the subtleties of the neutrino - nucleon interactions are crucial to the terrestrial observation of neutrino signals  @xcite .",
    "even though there are extensive measurements of the neutrino - nucleon scattering at gev energies  @xcite , very little data exist in the energy range up to 100 mev , relevant to the astrophysical applications .",

    "beta - beams are pure @xmath1 or @xmath2 beams produced by allowing radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring to decay  @xcite .",
    "low energy beta - beams , where one can vary the lorentz boost factor @xmath3 of the stored ions , offer a particular advantage to extract information about the energy dependence of the cross section in the energy range up to 100 mev .",
    "so far , several applications have been discussed in the literature concerning neutrino - nucleus scattering  @xcite , electroweak tests of the standard model  @xcite , as well as core - collapse supernova physics  @xcite .    in this paper , we explore the possibility of performing a conserved vector current ( cvc ) test by measuring the interaction of anti - neutrinos on protons in a water erenkov detector , using low energy beta - beams .",

    "@xcite ) . verifying that the cvc hypothesis correctly predicts tensor terms ( often referred to as weak magnetism ) is of fundamental importance  @xcite .",
    "the cvc prediction of the weak magnetism has been tested in an experiment involving the beta - decay of gamow - teller transitions in mirror nuclei in the a=12 triad  @xcite .",
    "one should note that whenever the allowed contributions to certain gamow - teller transitions are inhibited due to accidental cancellations , weak magnetism terms may contribute appreciably  @xcite . here , we propose a test based on neutrino - nucleon collisions at low momentum which would , in particular , have the advantage that there is no uncertainty coming from nuclear structure calculations .",

    "the weak magnetism term leaves a strong signature on the asymmetry of the angular distribution of the emitted positrons .",
