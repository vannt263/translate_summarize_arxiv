    "as explained , for example , in ref.@xcite , these two ratios at the resonance energy @xmath13 mev can be calculated from the imaginary ( @xmath14 ) parts of the multipole amplitudes of pion electroproduction reactions @xmath15}{im[m^{3/2}_{1^+ } ] } \\\\ r_{sm } & = & \\frac{im[s^{3/2}_{1^+}]}{im[m^{3/2}_{1^+}]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the standard notations ( @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20)@xcite of the multipole amplitudes are used in the right hand sides of the above equations .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 generated from the considered three models are compared in fig.1 along with the empirical values obtained from performing the amplitude analyses of the data from mit - bates@xcite , mainz@xcite , and jefferson laboratory ( jlab)@xcite . the comparison shown in fig.1 was already given in the publication@xcite by the jlab clas collaboration .",
    "we see from fig.1 that the @xmath6 ( right panel ) ratios predicted by the sl model ( solid curve ) and dmt model ( dashed curve ) are strikingly different in the @xmath0 ( gev / c)@xmath1 region",
    ". however their corresponding predictions of the ratio @xmath5 ( left panel ) are very close in the same low @xmath21 region .",
    "as we will see in figs.3 - 10 , all three models give almost the same @xmath22 amplitude at the resonance position @xmath23 mev .",
    "thus their differences seen in fig.1 can be understood from fig.2 where the @xmath21-dependence of the predicted ratios @xmath24/im[e_{1^+}]$ ] are compared .",
    "we see that the sl model prediction at @xmath25 is very close to the long wavelength limit @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) which is consistent with the results given in the papers by amaldi , fubini , and furlan@xcite and also by capstick and karl@xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath24/im[e_{1^+}]$ ] of dmt(maid2003 ) model approaches to 2 ( 3 ) at @xmath25 .",
    "thus their predictions of @xmath6 are very different , as seen in the right panel of fig.1 .",
    "as explained in section iv of ref.@xcite , the long wave length limit is used in the sl model to define the bare @xmath12 transition strength as @xmath28g_e(0)$ ] . with @xmath29",
    "determined from fitting the pion photoproduction data , @xmath30 is fixed in the sl model @xmath31 making use of the pion electroproduction data .",
    "in fig.1 we see that the @xmath6 data point at @xmath32 ( gev / c)@xmath1 from mit - bates@xcite and mainz@xcite disagrees with the prediction from the sl model , while it agrees with the results generated from the dmt and maid models .",
    "this difference between the sl model and the dmt model marks the large descrepancies between these two dynamical models in describing the pion cloud effects . as illustrated in fig.10 of ref.@xcite , the pion cloud effect can enhence the @xmath2 @xmath12 transition ( @xmath33 ) ) by a factor of about 2 at @xmath34 ( gev / c)@xmath1 and has a very prounced @xmath21-dependence .",
    "thus the experimental verifications of the predictions in the entire low @xmath21 region given in fig.1 will lead to a detailed understanding of the pion cloud effects .",
    "to give more detailed information for analyzing the new data , we compare in figs .",
    "3 - 10 the multipole amplitudes generated from the sl model ( solid curves ) , dmt model ( dashed curves ) , and maid2003 ( dotted curves ) .",
    "we see that they are in excellent agreement only in the imaginary part of the m1 multipole ( @xmath35 ) . for other resonant multipole amplitudes ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) ,",
    "the sl model differs significantly from the other two models .",
    "these differences can lead to rather different predictions on various interference cross sections @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath39 , and @xmath40",
    ".    for non - resonant multipole amplitudes in figs.3 - 10 , the differences between the considered three models are very large in some cases .",
    "however it is not easy to identify experimental observables which are most effective in testing these weaker amplitudes .    finally , we list in tables 1 - 4 the multipoles amplitudes generated from the sl model at @xmath41 0 .",
