    "the korn inequality is a key tool in the analysis of mathematical models for physical phenomena whose description only involves the symmetric part @xmath0 of the distributional gradient @xmath1 of vector - valued functions @xmath2 .",
    "the theory of ( generalized ) newtonian fluids , and the classical theories of plasticity and nonlinear elasticity constitute paradigmatic examples in this connection .",
    "a plain form of the korn inequality asserts that if @xmath3 is an open bounded set in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , then there exists a constant @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for every function @xmath9 vanishing , in a suitable sense , on @xmath10 .",

    "variants of inequality are also available . for instance , if @xmath3 is connected and regular enough , a version of still holds if the boundary condition is dropped , and the left - hand side is replaced with the ( @xmath12-th power of the ) distance , in the @xmath13 norm , of @xmath14 from the space of skew - symmetric matrices , namely the space of gradients of functions in the kernel of the operator @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "let us incidentally mention that nonlinear versions of korn s inequality have been shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite for further references ) .",
    "an extensive description of the historical background around korn - type inequalities can be found in@xcite .",
    "the present paper is mainly concerned with somewhat stronger , closely related inequalities , where the symmetric gradient @xmath16 of a function @xmath17 is replaced with its trace - free part @xmath18 , also called deviatoric part of the symmetric gradient .",
    "inequalities of this kind are critical in the analysis of mathematical models for compressible fluids @xcite .",
    "they also have important applications to general relativity .",
    "indeed , in the cauchy formulation of the einstein gravitational field equations , the initial data have to satisfy the einstein constraint equations on a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "one of these constraint equations amounts to the so - called momentum constraint equation , whose weak solutions can be obtained via minimization of an energy functional depending on @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "cosserat theory of elasticity is a further instance where trace - free korn - type inequalities come into play @xcite .",

    "a comprehensive treatment of the basic theory of the deviatoric korn inequality ( as well as of the standard korn inequality ) is offered , via modern analysis techniques , in the monograph @xcite . a simple proof in case @xmath21",
    "was given by dain @xcite .",

    "+ a counterpart of inequality for functions with unprescribed boundary values , where the left - hand side is replaced with the @xmath12-th power of the distance from the space of gradients of functions in the kernel of @xmath22 , takes a different form depending on whether @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "this kernel differs substantially in the two cases , and , in particular , it agrees with the whole space of holomorphic functions when @xmath23 .",
    "the inequalities in question require a distinct approach for @xmath23 and for @xmath25 . in what follows",
    ", we shall focus on the case when @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that inequality , and , a fortiori , inequality fail for the borderline values of the exponent @xmath12 , namely for @xmath27 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and @xmath28 ( with integrals replaced with norms in @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "the question thus arises of the validity of a version of inequalities and where the role of the power @xmath30 is played by a more general nonnegative convex function @xmath31 vanishing for @xmath32 , briefly a young function .",
    "this amounts to enlarging the class of @xmath33 norms of @xmath34 and @xmath1 in the korn inequality to include the norms in the orlicz spaces @xmath35 .",
    "korn - type inequalities in orlicz spaces are relevant in the analysis of mathematical models governed by strong nonlinearities of non - polynomial type .",
    "a korn inequality , for the symmetric gradient , in an orlicz space associated with a young function @xmath36 , is known to hold if @xcite , and only if @xcite , the young function @xmath36 satisfies the so called @xmath37 and @xmath38 conditions near infinity .",
    "inequalities involving special young functions fulfilling the @xmath37 and @xmath38 conditions were earlier established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , these conditions amount to requiring that @xmath36 has a uniform rate of growth near infinity , which is neither too slow , nor too rapid . on the other hand , imposing the @xmath37 and @xmath38 conditions rules out certain models in continuum mechanics .",
    "for instance , the nonlinearities appearing in the prandt - eyring fluids @xcite , and in models for plastic materials with logarithmic hardening @xcite are described by a young function @xmath31 that grows like @xmath39 near infinity , and hence violates the @xmath40 condition .",
    "young functions with fast growth , which do not fulfil the @xmath37 condition , are well suited to model the behavior of fluids in certain liquid body armors @xcite .",
    "a general orlicz version of the korn inequality has been established in @xcite . in that paper",
    ", it is shown that a korn - type inequality for the symmetric gradient @xmath34 in @xmath35 still holds , even if the @xmath37 and @xmath38 conditions on @xmath36 are dropped , provided that the norm of @xmath41 is taken in a possibly different orlicz space @xmath42 .",
    "the young functions @xmath36 and @xmath43 have to be suitably balanced , in such a way that the norm in @xmath42 turns out to be slightly weaker than that in @xmath35 when @xmath36 does not fulfil either the @xmath37 condition , or the @xmath38 condition near infinity .    here",
    ", we deal instead with trace - free korn - type inequalities .",
    "again , a priori arbitrary orlicz spaces are allowed . in their basic formulation for trial functions @xmath17 vanishing on @xmath44 ,",
    "the inequalities in question read @xmath45 their counterparts for functions @xmath17 with unrestricted boundary values , on a sufficiently regular connected and bounded open set @xmath3 , take the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the kernel of the operator @xmath22 .",
    "our main result amounts to necessary and sufficient balance conditions on the young functions @xmath36 and @xmath43 for inequalities and  or slight variants of theirs involving norms  to hold .",
    "it provides a comprehensive framework for genuinely new trace - free korn - type inequalities in borderline customary and unconventional orlicz spaces .",
    "examples are exhibited in section [ main ] below .",
    "in particular , our characterization recovers the fact that and hold with @xmath48 if @xcite , and only if @xcite the function @xmath36 fulfils both the @xmath37 and the @xmath38 condition near infinity .",
    "let us emphasize that the necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath36 and @xmath43 to support the orlicz - korn inequalities and turn out to agree with those required in @xcite for the orlicz - korn inequalities for the standard symmetric gradient .",
    "in fact , the necessity of the conditions for the former inequalities follows via a proof of the necessity of the same conditions for the latter inequalities , an issue which was left open in @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence is that we are now also in a position to derive the necessity of parallel conditions on the young functions appearing in inequalities for negative orlicz - sobolev norms , and in inequalities for the operator in orlicz spaces .",
    "these inequalities have recently been established in @xcite in connection with the study of elliptic systems , with non - polynomial nonlinearities , in fluid mechanics .",
    "to give an idea of the possible use of the results of this paper , we conclude this section with an outline of a model in fluid mechanics , for non - newtonian fluids , where korn inequalities , and trace - free korn inequalities in orlicz spaces come into play .",
    "the stationary flow of an isentropic compressible fluid in a bounded domain @xmath49 can be described by the system @xmath50 which accounts for the balance of mass and momentum . here , the velocity field @xmath51 and the density @xmath52 of the fluid are the unknown , whereas @xmath53 is a given system of volume forces .",
    "the deviatoric stress tensor @xmath54 and the pressure @xmath55 have to be related to @xmath17 and @xmath56 by constitutive laws .",
    "a general model for non - newtonian fluids takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 are given functions , and @xmath59 is the identity matrix  see for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if @xmath60 grows more slowly than @xmath61 ( in fact , typically @xmath60 can even vanish ) , and the function @xmath62 is non - decreasing , then a priori estimates only imply that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 the natural question that arises is to what extent the degree of integrability of @xmath65 is inherited by @xmath66 .",
    "this amounts to exibiting an optimal mutual dependence between the young functions @xmath36 and @xmath43 in inequality or .",
    "let us emphasize that the mathematical literature about general non - newtonian compressible fluids is quite limited .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that an analogue to the existence theory from @xcite seems to be presently out of reach .",
    "a much richer theory is available in the incompressible case , corresponding to a constant density @xmath56 in , and hence to the divergence - free constraint @xmath67 .",
