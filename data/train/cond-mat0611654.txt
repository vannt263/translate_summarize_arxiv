    "models of statistical mechanics defined over bethe lattices @xcite constitute a framework that , due to two peculiar ingredients , namely exact solvability and finite connectivity , as opposed to unsolvability of finite dimensional models ( for @xmath1 ) or to exact solvability of models defined over the fully connected graph ( mean field ) , sheds some light toward the understanding of more realistic models .",
    "it is in fact believed that several thermal properties of the model could persist for regular lattices as well . nowadays ,",
    "the emerging science of networks has attracted a renewed interested in such models @xcite .",
    "in fact , roughly speaking one can say that the bethe lattice represents the simplest prototype of network where an exact solution is often accessible . at least for uncorrelated random networks",
    ", it has been indeed proved that , if we indicate with @xmath2 the average over the network of some function @xmath3 of the vertex degree @xmath4 , the critical behavior of a given model with positive couplings defined over a bethe lattice of degree @xmath5 , coincides with that defined over the network provided that an effective substitution @xmath6 for taking into account of the distribution of link ends rather than that of links , is performed @xcite .",
    "as is known , the exact solvability of a model defined over a bethe lattice relies on the fact that the lattice is a tree , _",
    "i.e. _ , a graph without loops @xcite . however , in relatively recent years progresses have been made in facing , analytically , models defined over lattices in which a finite number of closed paths per vertex is also allowed @xcite , which we refer as `` generalized tree - like structures '' , see fig . [ f00 ] , and models defined over graphs in which the tree - like structure is partially broken due to the presence of an infinite number of closed paths per vertex as happens in generalized bethe lattices ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) and in husimi trees @xcite . the graph depicted in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] is an example of a husimi tree .",
    "is defined : a triangular husimi tree .",
    "the continuous segments constitute a bethe lattice @xmath7 ( an infinite tree ) .",
    "dashed segments connect vertices of @xmath7 belonging to the same shell .",
    "note that , a part the root 0 , the degree of @xmath7 is @xmath8 , whereas the degree of the husimi tree is @xmath9 . ]    notice that , by definition , in a loop both vertices and bonds repetitions are forbidden , whereas in a closed path only bonds repetitions are forbidden ; in a closed path a same vertex can be crossed more than one time .",
    "so that , for example , in the graph of fig .",
    "[ f00 ] , and in a regular @xmath10-dimensional lattice with @xmath11 or in the graph of fig .",
    "[ f0 ] , the number of loops per vertex is finite , but the number of closed paths per vertex is finite only in the graph of fig .",
    "this kind of difference reflects on the different complexities in solving models defined on generalized tree - like structures and non tree - like structures ; whereas the first class of problems can be exactly faced in the framework of a suitable bethe - peierls approach ( see for example the reviews @xcite ) or , alternatively , by using the rules given in the refs .",
    "@xcite for determining the critical surfaces , for the second class of problems , in general , a closed analytical method is lacking .",
    "an exception to this is provided by models defined over generalized bethe lattices and husimi trees . for these models in fact ,",
    "the problem of statistical mechanics can be mapped on a that of a dynamical system involving few degrees of freedom @xcite . in particular , the model defined over the husimi tree of fig .",
    "[ f0 ] , which is the subject of this paper , can be solved analytically in a closed form .    in these kind of relatively solvable models ,",
    "one is usually interested in studying competition effects , so that two or more independent couplings @xmath12 along the links of the lattice are given .",
    "as already investigated by numerical and semi - analytical methods , not only on generalized bethe lattices and husimi trees @xcite , but even on finite dimensional lattices @xcite , due to the competitiveness in amplitude and sign of the couplings and to the presence of loops giving rise to frustration @xcite , a quite rich scenario of phases can take place .",
    "in fact , besides ferro and antiferromagnetism , competing interactions lie at the heart of a variety of original phenomena in magnetic systems , including the existence of modulated @xcite and spin glass phases @xcite .    after the study of the ising and the potts competitive models @xcite defined over generalized bethe lattices and husimi trees with a uniform or periodic distribution of the couplings @xmath12 ,",
    "the next natural step toward the complexity of these competitive models is the introduction of disorder .",
    "we present here a twofold study of the simpler ising model with two competitive interactions @xmath13 and @xmath14 defined over the triangular husimi tree of fig . [ f0 ] .",
    "we first review this model giving the proper interpretation of the phases in terms of the magnetization .",
    "then we introduce the disorder to study the triangular @xmath0 model . to this aim",
    ", we let @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be random couplings having a discrete probability distribution whose spread , _",
    "i.e. _ , the measures of the disorder , is characterized by two parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the analysis of the phase diagram of the random model is done by using an effective method recently developed in @xcite and already used in @xcite .",
    "this method consists on a mapping between the phase diagram of the random model and the corresponding non random one . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that , in the thermodynamic limit , the upper phase boundary of the random model one finds by using this mapping , as well as the corresponding critical behavior , become exact whenever the graph over which the model is defined turns out to be infinite dimensional in a broad sense , as happens for instance in generalized tree - like structures or generalized bethe lattices and husimi trees .",
    "unlike what emphasized in a previous version of this manuscript however , we stress here that bethe lattices ( here meant as infinite trees ) and husimi trees represent a limit case where the mapping in general is not well defined . in fact , the mapping can establish a correspondence between the random model and a corresponding non random one , both built up over the same graph , only if their density free energies exist ( more precisely the non trivial part of the density free energy , see eq . ( [ free1 ] ) ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the recent work @xcite for a rigorous formulation of the mapping .",
    "it happens unfortunately that , due to the problem of the boundary conditions ( see also the discussion in appendix ) , which in a bethe lattice and in a husimi tree constitute a finite fraction of the total size of the system , in a bethe lattice ( here meant as an infinite tree ) and in a husimi tree , the density free energy , as a proper thermodynamic limit , does not exist ( however the circumstances for a bethe lattice is in some sense fortunate and the mapping turns out exact ) .",
    "therefore we advise the reader that the results we report in this manuscript can not be taken as exact ; they have to be considered as a mere application of the mapping being here formal and not rigorous .",
    "nevertheless , the equations of the mapping are still defined and , as an approximation , they can be applied in a husimi tree case as well .",
    "in fact , in studying another random version of the model , the diluted frustrated model , in which the disorder is introduced by randomly deleting the negative couplings @xmath17 with some probability @xmath18 , we have found some differences between the results one can obtain by applying the mapping and the results one can find by using a bethe - peierls - like approach @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , in the limit @xmath19 , this latter method succeeds in giving the exact percolation threshold @xmath20 , while the mapping gives @xmath21 ; and a larger difference is observed in the opposite limit @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless we think that the application of the mapping also in the husimi tree cases provides easily important information of the random model .",
    "we stress in fact that in the mapping no ad hoc approximation , like the local tree - like approximation , is introduced .    for the present model , eqs .",
    "( [ compet]-[dm2 ] ) , we have found the following scenario . concerning the magnetization , in the non random model in the frustrated regions",
    "there is no phase transition for @xmath23 even at @xmath24 , and this is physically explained by looking directly at the ground state that becomes equivalent to a gas of non interacting dimers with coupling @xmath17 ( also called a spin liquid in the literature ) . in the @xmath0 triangular model instead , even for @xmath25 , there exists always a stable spin glass transition and , for suitable values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 a ferro or antiferromagnetic disordered transition may exist as well . whereas the latter transition can be read just as due to an effective renormalization of the couplings @xmath26 and @xmath17 , the former transition is interpreted as due to the onset of the overlap ordering of the dimers , as signaled by the study of the exact ground states of the non random model which is equivalent to the random one for @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that in the limit @xmath27 the picture in terms of non interacting dimers is recovered also in the glassy phase .",
    "we shall limit ourself mainly to the study of the critical surfaces inferring little on the nature of the several phases .",
    "furthermore , we recall that for negative couplings , the correspondence between the solution of the ising model on the bethe lattice ( the graph of fig .",
    "[ f0 ] with @xmath28 ) and that on a corresponding sparse system ( like the erd@xmath29s r@xmath30nyi random graph ) , where long global frustrated loops are also present , is lost .",
    "therefore , following the same philosophy of , _",
    "e.g. _ , the refs .",
    "@xcite , the solution we will present here concerns , strictly speaking , only an ising model model defined over a structure where global loops are absent .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that since we take into account the effect of all the other explicit loops , at least for certain aspects , the solution we find sheds some light also on a possible sparse representation of the model even in the frustrated regions .",
    "in fact , the ground state we describe in sec . 3 has a quite strong similarity to that one finds in the anisotropic triangular ising model @xcite .",
    "the competitive non random model was partially already analyzed in @xcite .",
    "notice that it is different from the model considered in the ref .",
    "@xcite ( third item ) ; in fact , in the non random case , its relative simplicity allows an exact analytical study .",
    "note also that in the refs . @xcite",
    "no detail about the ground states was given .",
    "very recently , a renewed attention has been attracted by the role of loops both in statistical mechanics and computer science @xcite .",
    "in fact , even if the most used bethe - peierls approximation usually works well in many important models near to be tree - like , rigorously speaking , it becomes exact only in perfect tree - structures and generalized tree - like structures , like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ f00 ] , whereas in more complex graphs like that of fig .",
    "[ f0 ] , can be wrong .",
    "successful efforts have been made toward a general treatment of the problem and systematic corrections to the bethe - peierls approximation have been now rigorously established @xcite . however , as a general rule , we recall that between the complexity , both analytical or numerical , in solving a random model and a corresponding non random one there is a gap .",
    "in fact , in general the approach used to solve , possibly exactly , the latter , does not lend itself to be simply adapted to the former .",
    "our study , even if limited to the knowledge of the upper critical surface and to the critical behavior , constitutes an example of a general procedure which , at least in the cases where the conditions for the mapping are satisfied , covers this gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "4 we recall the mapping through which the phase diagram of the random model will be analyzed in the following sec .",
    "5 . finally , some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "4 . the appendix a is devoted to sec . 3",
    "let us consider a semi - infinite bethe lattice @xmath7 in which any vertex , but a singular one 0 , has coordination number @xmath8 ( _ i.e. _ branching number @xmath31 ) as in fig .",

    "[ f1 ] , the corresponding ground states , despite the frustration , are simply f and af , respectively .",
    "the reason for that lies on the smallness ( in modulo ) of the coupling @xmath17 in the two mentioned regions .",

    "the phase diagram of a competitive ising model defined over the triangular husimi tree has been analyzed , both in the non random and the random version ( spin glass model ) .",
    "first , we have analyzed the non random case providing , in particular , an interesting physical characterization of the ground states in the frustrated regions in terms of a zero temperature phase transition between an ordered or antiordered state of connected triangles ( f or af ) and a gas of non interacting two state dimers ( also called a spin liquid in the literature ) .",
    "a natural question is whether or not this zero temperature phase transition represents the zero temperature boundary of a finite temperature phase transition .",
    "second , we have introduced the disorder and studied the upper phase diagram and the corresponding critical behavior of the random case which , in particular , gives an affirmative answer to the above question .",

    "for the two couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 we have chosen the disorder giving rise to the triangular @xmath0 model .",
    "we can observe directly the role of the explicit frustration induced by the presence of the loops tuned by the amplitude and the sign of the parameter - coupling @xmath14 . as expected from an argument based on high temperature expansion and on frustration ,",

    "we observe the following scenario . in the non frustrated regions ( that is the sectors i and iii of the phase diagrams ) , in the spin glass model we find an `` ordinary '' competition ( like in the sherrington kirkpatrick model ) between a p - sg and a p - f or p - af transitions , in which the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath17 are simply renormalized by the mapping and the spin glass transition signals the onset of spin overlaps . in the frustrated regions instead ( sectors ii and iv of the phase diagrams )",

    "whereas in the infinite husimi tree one has to solve the model with the hamiltonian ( [ compet ] ) for vertices far from the boundary , and this is done by considering in all the calculation the lattice as infinite from the very beginning , in the finite husimi tree one has to take into account also the boundary in the finite lattice and to perform the thermodynamic limit in the proper manner by calculating the correlation functions only from the density free energy after the thermodynamic limit has been taken .",
    "the relations between infinite and finite husimi trees are on the same level of those between bethe lattices and cayley trees .",
    "it turns out that the physics , and in particular the free energy , described by these two versions of models is quite different @xcite . nevertheless , the equations defining the effective fields for the central spin used in both the approaches are the same implying that also the fixed points , and then the equations for the critical surfaces and the magnetization of the central spin , are the same .",
