    "a force field ( or potential energy ) for protein systems is necessary to perform molecular simulations based on monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) methods . well - known force fields are , for instance , amber @xcite , charmm @xcite , opls @xcite , gromos @xcite , and ecepp @xcite .",
    "these force fields have been parameterized to fit experimental data of small molecules and , for some terms , the results of quantum chemistry calculations and md simulations .",
    "we have recently carried out detailed comparisons of three versions of amber ( parm94 @xcite , parm96 @xcite , and parm99 @xcite ) , charmm @xcite , opls - aa / l @xcite , and gromos @xcite by generalized - ensemble simulations @xcite of two small peptides in explicit solvent .",
    "@xcite the results of these comparisons indicated that these force fields yield quite different secondary - structure - forming tendencies .",
    "it was shown that amber parm94 is the most ( and too much ) @xmath2-helix - forming among the six force fields studied and that amber parm99 and charmm give ample amount of @xmath2-helix structures , whereas amber parm96 , opls - aa / l , and gromos are more @xmath3-sheet - forming than the rest .",
    "@xcite these results were confirmed by the folding simulations of the two peptides with implicit solvent model .",
    "@xcite our conclusion was that we need to refine and improve the existing force - field parameters in order to yield the secondary - structure - forming tendencies that agree with experimental implications .",
    "@xcite among the force - field terms , the torsion - energy term is the most problematic .",
    "for instance , the parm94 , parm96 , and parm99 versions of amber differ mainly in the backbone - torsion - energy parameters . the main changes from opls - aa to opls - aa / l can also be found in the torsion - energy term .",
    "@xcite other trials of force - field refinement mainly concentrate on the torsion - energy terms .",
    "these modifications of the torsion energy are usually based on quantum chemistry calculatioins @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed to set the backbone torsion - energy term simply to zero .",
    "@xcite we have proposed another force - field refinement procedures @xcite . using the standard functional forms of the force fields ,",
    "we refine the force - field parameters so that they are the most consistent with the coordinates of proteins in the protein data bank ( pdb ) database .",
    "this is achieved by minimization of forces acting on the atoms with the coordinates of the pdb with respect to the force - field parameters .",
    "we found that our refinement of partial - charge and backbone - torsion - energy parameters resulted in the improvement of three versions of amber ( parm94 , parm96 , and parm99 ) , charmm , and opls - aa @xcite .    in this article , we propose a new backbone - torsion - energy term , which is represented by a double fourier series in two variables , the backbone dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this expression gives a natural representation of the torsion energy in the ramachandran space @xcite in the sense that any two - dimensional energy surface periodic in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be expanded by the double fourier series .",
    "we can then easily control secondary - structure - forming tendencies by modifying the backbone - torsion - energy surface .",
    "we accommodated our approach to amber parm94 and amber parm96 and tested whether our modifications of the backbone - torsion - energy term resulted in the expected change of secondary - structure - forming - tendencies by performing folding simulations of @xmath2-helical and @xmath3-hairpin peptides .    in section 2 the details of the double fourier series as the backbone - torsion - energy term",
    "are given . in section 3",
    "the results of applications of the double fourier series to modifications of amber parm94 and parm96 force fields are presented .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the existing all - atom force fields for protein systems such as amber and charmm use essentially the same functional forms for the conformational potential energy @xmath4 except for minor differences .",
    "@xmath4 can be written as , for instance , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 represent the bond - stretching term , the bond - bending term , the torsion - energy term , and the nonbonded energy term , respectively .",
    "the torsion energy is usually given by @xmath10~ , \\label{ene_torsion}\\ ] ] where the first summation is taken over all dihedral angles @xmath11 ( both in the backbone and in the side chains ) , @xmath12 is the number of waves , @xmath13 is the phase , and @xmath14 is the fourier coefficient . separating the contributions @xmath15 of the backbone dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the rest of the torsion terms @xmath16 , we can write @xmath17 where we have @xmath18 + \\sum_n \\frac{v_n}{2 } [ 1 + \\cos ( n \\psi - \\gamma_n ) ] ~. \\label{ene_torsion2}\\ ] ] for example , the coefficients for the cases of amber parm94 and amber parm96 are summarized in table  [ table - org - torsion ] , and we can rewrite @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion2 ] ) as follows : @xmath19 @xmath20    the backbone - torsion - energy term @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion2 ] ) is a sum of two one - dimensional fourier series : one is for @xmath0 and the other for @xmath1 .",
    "the two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent , and no correlation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be incorporated .",
    "any periodic function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with period @xmath21 can be expanded by a double fourier series . as a simple generalization of @xmath15",
    ", we therefore propose to express this backbone torsion energy by the following double fourier series : @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath12 are the numbers of waves , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the fourier coefficients .",
    "this equation includes cross terms in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while the original term in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion2 ] ) has no mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , our new torsion - energy term can represent more complex energy surface than the conventional one .",
    "the fourier coefficients , by definition , are given by @xmath33 where @xmath2 are the normalization constants and @xmath34 are the basis functions for the fourier series .",
    "table  [ coe_table ] summarizes these coefficients and functions . here , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are given in radians , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are in degrees ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "hereafter , angular quantities without tilde and with tilde are in radians and in degrees , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ new_phipsi ] ) and @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsionb ] ) define our torsion - energy term in eq .",
    "( [ ene_conf ] ) ( instead of eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion ] ) ) : @xmath40    the double fourier series in eq .",
    "( [ new_phipsi ] ) is particularly useful , because it describes the backbone - torsion - energy surface in the ramachandran space .",
    "the fourier series can express the torsion - energy surface @xmath39 that was obtained by any method including quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "@xcite    moreover , one can refine the existing backbone - torsion - energy term and control the secondary - structure - forming tendencies of the force fields .",
    "for example , @xmath2-helix is obtained for @xmath41 , @xmath42-helix for @xmath43 , @xmath44-helix for @xmath45 , parallel @xmath3-sheet for @xmath46 , antiparallel @xmath3-sheet for @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "@xcite hence , if the existing force field gives , say , too little @xmath2-helix - forming tendency compared to experimental results , one can lower the backbone - torsion - energy surface near @xmath48 in order to enhance @xmath2-helix formations .",
    "we can thus write @xmath49 where @xmath15 is the existing backbone - torsion - energy term that we want to refine and @xmath50 is a function that has peaks around the corresponding regions where specific secondary structures are to be enhanced .",
    "there are many possible choices for @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , one can use the following function when one wants to lower the torsion - energy surface in a single region near @xmath51 : @xmath52                       0~ , & ~{\\rm otherwise}~ ,                       \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{mod_surface2}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are constants that we adjust for refinement . in this case , the energy surface is lowered by @xmath50 in a circular region of radius @xmath55 , which is centered at @xmath51 .",
    "note that we should also impose periodic boundary conditions on @xmath50 .",
    "we then express @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ mod_surface ] ) in terms of the double fourier series in eq .",
    "( [ new_phipsi ] ) , where the fourier coefficients are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ coe_eqn ] ) .",
    "hence , we can fine - tune the backbone - torsion - energy term by the above procedure so that it yields correct secondary - structure - forming tendencies .",
    "we now present the results of the applications of our backbone torsion energy in eq .",
    "( [ new_phipsi ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we consider the following truncated fourier series : @xmath56 this function has 13 fourier - coefficient parameters .",
    "we will see below that this number of fourier terms is sufficient for most of our purposes , but that for some cases more number of fourier terms are preferred .",
    "we first check how well the truncated fourier series in eq .",

    "( [ ene_torsion_parm94 ] ) and ( [ ene_torsion_parm96 ] ) . because these functions are already the sum of one - dimensional fourier series and subsets of the double fourier series in eq .",
