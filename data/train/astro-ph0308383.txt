    "an important goal of modern cosmology is to understand the evolution of active galaxies and their relationship to normal galaxy evolution . a key piece of information needed to further this understanding is an accurate knowledge of the luminosity function ( lf ) for agn over a wide range of absolute magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "the agn lf is populated by quasars at the bright end ( e.g. hartwick & schade 1990 ) and seyfert galaxy nuclei , considered to be their intrinsically fainter counterparts , at the low luminosity end ( cheng @xmath7  1985 ; huchra & burg 1992 ; maiolino & rieke 1995 ; koehler @xmath7  1997 ; ulvestad & ho 2001 ; londish @xmath7  2002 ) .    understanding how the faint end of the agn lf evolves is of particular importance for determining the frequency and total space density of agns at earlier epochs .",
    "this has obvious implications for determining their total contribution to the x - ray , ir and uv backgrounds .",
    "large numbers of low - luminosity agn have been proposed to explain the ionization of the intergalactic medium at high redshift ( steidel & sargent 1989 ) , although recent observational and theoretical results differ on the amount of their true contribution ( barger 2003 ; schirber & bullock 2003 ) .",
    "additionally , the faint end is an important constraint on evolutionary models for the agn lf such as pure luminosity and luminosity - dependent density evolution ( e.g. boyle @xmath7  2000 ) .",
    "one method to identify agn in imaging surveys is via their variable nature .",
    "qsos and seyfert galaxies have long been known as variable objects , with significant optical flux changes occurring on timescales of months to several years .",
    "variability has been a successful method for identifying agns , primarily qsos ( hawkins 1986 ; koo @xmath7  1986 ; hook @xmath7  1994 ) .",
    "a survey for variable sources in sa57 revealed many optically extended , seyfert - like galaxies ( bershady @xmath7  1998 ) which generally had higher variability amplitudes than the more luminous qsos .",
    "this result suggests that variability is a good technique for selecting intrinsically faint qsos and seyfert nuclei .    while variability and other selection techniques ( spectroscopy , color selection , etc . )",
    "have been successful in finding qsos out to high redshifts , the intrinsically fainter agn ( i.e. seyfert galaxies ) have been difficult to detect beyond the local universe .",
    "ground - based variability surveys , like spectroscopic surveys , are quickly limited to agn which dominate the host galaxy light at higher redshift .",
    "recent x - ray surveys with chandra and xmm - newton have revealed hundreds of x - ray sources at z@xmath01 .",
    "many of these are confirmed agn but still many more are ambiguous in nature ( e.g barger @xmath7  2002 ) . in summary ,",
    "the population of moderate - to - high redshift , low - luminosity agn has not been well surveyed and the evolution of the faint end of the agn lf is still poorly known .    in this study , we have searched for optical nuclear variability in hdf galaxies to identify the population of active galaxies out to z@xmath31 .",
    "the primary data sets analyzed for galactic variability are the original hdf observations ( williams @xmath7  1996 ) obtained in december 1995 and a second v - band ( f606w ) image obtained almost exactly 5 years later in december of 2000 .",
    "the main advantage of hst over ground - based surveys is the ability to do accurate photometry within smaller apertures than can be done from the ground thus allowing us to probe much lower agn / host galaxy luminosity ratios .",
    "we discuss the details of the image processing and photometry in section 2 , followed by a discussion of the selected varying galactic nuclei in sections 3 and 4 . in section 5 , we cross - reference our sources with various multi - wavelength surveys .",
    "a discussion of the optical spectra for the varying sources is presented in section 6 . in section 7",
    ", we present the luminosity function for variable nuclei .",
    "we close with a summary of our conclusions in section 8 .",
    "the original epoch hdf data in f606w consisted of 108 individual exposures with a total integration time of 113,050 seconds .",
    "these data were obtained with a total of 9 unique dithers covering both sub - pixel offsets and multiple pixels on a scale of about @xmath8 10 wf pixels .",
    "the primary data processing technique was detailed in gilliland , nugent , and phillips ( 1999 ) for creation of over - sampled , by a factor of four , summed images with resulting noise and resolution properties competitive with , and sometimes slightly better than those reported in williams @xmath7  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the mean epoch of the original f606w data was mjd 50076.9 .",
    "exposure times used for the original epoch ranged from 350 to 1500 seconds with a mean sky rate of 0.0758 e-/s .    the second epoch hdf data in f606w was taken with go-8389 ( pi rodrigo ibata ) with a science goal distinct from that here , but one that also required precise differential measurements across the two epochs . these data consisted of 70 individual exposures each of 1300 seconds for a total exposure time of 91,000 seconds .",
    "the goal was to have the new data obtained at the same pointing as the original hdf , and at the same orientation , and with dithering over the same spatial scale , but with an improved level of sampling using 35 unique dithers .",
    "this goal was quite well met , thus resulting in quite similar data in the two f606w epochs .",
    "the mean epoch of the second f606w data was mjd 51882.9 implying a delta of 4.94 years .",
    "the mean sky rate for the newer epoch was 0.0958 e-/s .",
    "processing of the second epoch data was identical to that of the first , using the same software as described in gilliland , nugent and phillips ( 1999 ) . to facilitate simple , robust analysis of data from the two epochs the registrations of the second epoch",
    "were evaluated using a grid of galaxies from the original epoch ( stars could not be used since these show unique proper motions over five years ) ; this results in second epoch over - sampled combined images that are accurately aligned to the first epoch with _ maximum _ errors of @xmath30.05 pixels .",
    "therefore , comparative analysis for change across epochs can be made using precisely the same pixels , mapping back to common physical domains .",
    "for both epochs , each individual frame was sky subtracted before combining , cosmic rays were eliminated ( effected pixels assigned zero weight in the combination ) and hot pixels subtracted .    the extreme stability provided by _",
    "hst _ is an essential factor in being able to probe to unique sensitivity levels with these extensive observations . limiting factors , to be discussed further below ,",
    "arise from ( 1 ) a time - varying charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) that must be empirically corrected for , and ( 2 ) limited sub - pixel dithering in the first hdf epoch that results in minor mismatches noticeable for the objects with tight cores at high signal to noise .",
    "we created a catalog of hdf objects using daofind in iraf to ensure a systematic selection of all sources in the v - band images .",
    "all objects above the 8@xmath9 detection threshold were identified in the 1995 images ( the deeper of the two ) using a kernel size of 1.8@xmath10 the semi - major axis of the gaussian convolution kernel ( 1.3 pixels ) to allow more sensitivity to extended objects .",
    "the catalog was then edited to remove a minority of objects that did not appear to be centered on galaxies ( i.e. multiple detections within single galaxies ) .",
    "for very amorphous galaxies with no clear center , all bright  knots \" appearing within the source were retained in the catalog .    for our photometry , we chose a small aperture consistent with the fwhm of stellar sources in the field",
    ". stars have fwhm@xmath05.5 pixels in the over - sampled images corresponding to @xmath30.14@xmath11 .",
    "we chose an aperture size of 6 pixels in diameter to be most sensitive to photometric changes in an unresolved nucleus .",
    "this approach differs from that taken in sarajedini , gilliland & phillips ( 2000 ; hereafter sgp ) , where the aperture size was scaled to the size of the galaxy .",
    "our goal here is to provide better sensitivity to variable active nuclei with less dilution from the underlying , non - varying host galaxy light .",
    "aperture photometry for all sources was performed on the direct images using the phot algorithm in iraf .",
    "because the second epoch image was aligned with the first , exactly the same pixels were used in both epochs . during image processing ,",
    "the background was subtracted and the images were scaled to an exposure time of 6000s .",
    "this allowed the sky value to be held constant at zero for both epochs and all wf ccds .",
    "the resulting nuclear magnitudes for each galaxy in the hdf were then adjusted by a zero - point offset to bring them into agreement with the integrated , isophotal galaxy v - band ab magnitudes of williams @xmath7  ( 1996 ) .      after performing aperture photometry , nuclear variability",
    "can then be determined by simply obtaining the difference in magnitude for each source over the two epochs .",
    "figure 1 shows the magnitude difference between the 1995 and 2000 images as a function of magnitude within an aperture of r@xmath23 pixels , the equivalent of 0.15@xmath11 in diameter .",
    "the solid line represents no difference in magnitude between the two epochs .",
    "the main culprit producing the obvious offset from the solid line is charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses . as in sgp",
    ", we find a clear correlation of the photometric differences with position on the ccd and magnitude .",
    "this is the well known cte effect ( whitmore @xmath7  1999 ; biretta @xmath7  2001 ) which causes targets far from the ccd readout amplifier to appear fainter than similar targets near the amplifier .",
    "for this reason , the effect is usually more significant in the y - direction , ( the direction of the readout down the ccd ) than the x - direction ( the direction of the readout of the shift register at the bottom of the ccd ) .",
    "although the 19951997 i - band study did not show significant correlations in the x - direction , the longer time interval sampled here does show a significant correlation in the x - direction for all 3 wf ccds . additionally , we note that the slope of the relation is generally steeper in the y - direction than had been determined in sgp .",
    "this is expected due to the longer 5 year time interval between epochs in this study .",
    "we first attempted to fit the relationship between object position , magnitude difference and magnitude globally for all 3 wf ccds as done in sgp .",
    "however , we found that this approach was not sufficient to equally remove the cte effect from all wf ccds .",
    "differences in the slope of the relation between the ccds were significant and could easily be determined for each ccd individually .",
    "we adopted a two - step approach to determine this relationship .",
    "first , we fit a linear surface to the x and y object positions and the magnitude differences using surfit in iraf for each ccd . while the slope of the fit was found to be significant with both the x and y positions , the value of the slope was steeper with y position in all 3 wf ccds , consistent with what is expected for cte losses .",
    "the slope of the relation between y position and magnitude difference was found to be -2.6@xmath1010@xmath12 , -1.3@xmath1010@xmath12 and -1.46@xmath1010@xmath12 mag / pixel for wf2 , wf3 and wf4 respectively .",
    "the slope of the relation with x position , while significant , was found to be about an order of magnitude lower in all 3 wf ccds .",
    "these fits were used to correct the magnitude difference values for position - dependent offsets .",
    "secondly we fit the dependence of the magnitude difference with nuclear magnitude .",
    "a 3rd order fit was required to properly model the dependence in all 3 wf ccds . after applying this correction to the data in figure 1 ,",
    "the resulting photometric differences are shown in figure 2 as a function of nuclear magnitude .    finally , we determine the expected noise level for non - variable sources . as in sgp , we divided the full set of individual exposures into two sets composed simply of the odd - numbered frames and the even - numbered frames .",
    "each set represents an  epoch \" without any real time difference .",
    "these images effectively carry through the effects of object and sky poisson noise , readout noise , and possible errors in the adopted sky zero points .",
    "the magnitude of each galaxy was then measured in the odd and even data sets and difference in magnitude vs. the average magnitude within r@xmath23 pixel apertures is shown in figure 3a .",
    "figure 3b is the rms of the intensity differences shown in a ) within unity magnitude intervals .",
    "the solid line represents a quadratic fit to the points which is the adopted 1@xmath9 galaxy photometric error as a function of magnitude .",
    "the precision of the photometry must be independently limited at the bright end of the distribution , since systematic effects not captured by the odd - even data set comparisons become limiting factors ( e.g. the sometimes poor distribution of sub - pixel phase - space dithers in the first epoch data ) . in sgp",
    ", we adopted a floor of 1.2% . here",
    "we adopt a more conservative value of 1.5% consistent with the use of much smaller apertures on average for bright sources in the current study than in sgp .",
    "as should be apparent , this is a reasonable limit for photometric precision to adopt , but in detail remains somewhat arbitrary .",
    "figure 4a is the absolute value , cte - corrected magnitude differences for sources in the hdf .",
    "the solid line represents the 3@xmath9 limit for variability significance ( 3@xmath10 the rms indicated by the solid line in figure 3b ) .",
    "objects above this limit are selected as significant variables and are indicated with open hexagons .",
    "figure 4b is the result of normalizing the magnitude difference by this solid line . here",
    "the y - axis indicates the level of significance of each source in units of @xmath9 .",
    "the x - axis extends at the faint end to v@xmath1@xmath229.0 , which is the estimated photometric completeness magnitude limit for galaxy nuclei in this survey . beyond this limit ,",
    "the number counts for galaxies in the hdf begin to decrease .",
    "we find sixteen galaxies whose nuclei have undergone at least a 3@xmath9 variation over the 5 year time interval .",
    "these sources are listed in table 1 with columns as follows : ( 1 ) williams @xmath7  ( 1996 ) i d , ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) ra & dec ( j2000 ) , ( 4 ) redshift from the literature , ( 5 ) spectral type based on photometry from fernndez - soto , lanzetta and yahil ( 1999 , hereafter : fly ) , ( 6 ) v@xmath1 internal to r=3 pixel aperture , ( 7 ) magnitude difference between 1995 and 2000 ; positive implies brighter in 1995 , ( 8) significance of change obtained when normalized by the expected error as a function of magnitude , ( 8) bulge - to - total ( b / t ) 2-dimensional model fits for the i(f814w ) images from marleau & simard ( 1998 ) .",
    "the last several columns relate to the source detection at other wavelengths discussed in section 5 .",
    "there are two distinct completeness issues that effect our survey .",
    "the first is related to the incomplete time - sampling of the variable sources we wish to detect .",
    "most variability surveys employ a method where the survey field is imaged several times over many years ( e.g. trevese @xmath7  1994 ; hawkins 2002 ) . depending on the quality of the data",
    ", these surveys have shown that virtually all known agn will be found to vary if observed periodically over several years .",
    "our study is limited by the fact that we have only two epochs with which to determine variability and therefore sample just two points on the lightcurve of a varying source .",
    "because of this , we will be incomplete in our census of agn since some varying sources could lie at magnitudes close to their original magnitude measured 5 years earlier and would thus go undetected in our survey .",
    "we estimate our incompleteness due to undersampling of the lightcurve by using variability data for agn obtained over many years .",
    "we randomly select points along the lightcurve separated by 5 years , the time interval sampled by our hdf images .",
    "because long term variability surveys for low - luminosity agn have not yet been published , we have conducted this test with two sets of qso lightcurve data ; a sample of pg quasars from giveon @xmath7  ( 1999 ) and a sample of sa57 quasars from trevese @xmath7  ( 1994 ) .",
    "giveon @xmath7  monitored 42 quasars over 7 years with a typical sampling interval of 40 days while trevese @xmath7  monitored 64 over 15 years about once a year . sampling these lightcurves every 5 years and assuming photometric errors typical of our hdf images , we can estimate the probability that these sources would be detected in our survey .",
    "we find that @xmath37580% would be detected as varying by at least 3@xmath9 with only 2 observations separated by 5 years .",
    "therefore , the results of our analysis are likely to underrepresent the true number of variable nuclei by @xmath32025% .    the second incompleteness issue results from the use of a fixed aperture to detect nuclear variability .",
    "we have chosen a small , fixed aperture to minimize dilution of the agn light from the underlying host galaxy to be more sensitive to agn varying within bright hosts .",
    "we set this aperture to the size of an unresolved point source in the hst images ( 0.15@xmath11 in diameter ) .",
    "the fixed aperture will include the same amount of light from an unresolved source regardless of its redshift .",
    "however , the aperture will contain a larger fraction of the underlying , resolved galaxy for higher redshift objects than for low - z sources . because of this , the dilution of the nuclear light by the galaxy increases as a function of redshift and , consequently , as a function of nuclear magnitude .",
    "if we assume a disk - dominated , r@xmath13=1 kpc galaxy containing an agn that is 10% of the host galaxy light and varying by @xmath14m=0.3 magnitudes , the measured @xmath14 m within our fixed aperture would be 0.15 magnitudes at z=0.2 but only 0.06 magnitudes at z=1 .",
    "the observed total nuclear magnitude would drop by @xmath33 magnitudes over this interval .",
    "the increasing dilution with redshift is compounded by the increasing photometric errors with magnitude . for an agn that has varied by @xmath14m=0.30.2 mags ,",
    "consistent with typical structure function values for agn ( trevese @xmath7  1994 ) , and reasonable estimates for the galaxy magnitude , morphology , physical size and true agn fraction , we estimate that incompleteness due to significant agn dilution begins to effect our survey at magnitudes between v@xmath1@xmath026.5 to v@xmath1@xmath027.5 .    as can be seen in figure 4 ,",
    "all of the variables lie at magnitudes greater than v@xmath1=27.3 . while this may partially be due to a real astrophysical effect ( see discussion in section 4 )",
    ", this limiting magnitude is within the range of our incompleteness estimate above .",
    "therefore , although we survey galaxy nuclei to v@xmath1@xmath029 , our limit for detecting _ variable agn _ at a uniformly varying level within galaxy nuclei is probably closer to v@xmath1@xmath027.5 , with decreasing completeness fainter than v@xmath1@xmath026.5 .",
    "the 16 variable nuclei detected in our survey represent 2.2% of the galaxies brighter than v@xmath1@xmath229.0 or 7.4% of the galaxies brighter than v@xmath1@xmath227.5 . to emphasize",
    "the significance of the variable sources , figure 5 is a histogram of the sigma distribution for galaxies in the hdf .",
    "the x - axis is the absolute value of the normalized magnitude difference ( @xmath9 ) and the y - axis is the natural logarithm of the number of sources in 0.25@xmath9 bins .",
    "errorbars represent the poisson statistical errors .",
    "filled circles show the histogram for all 719 nuclei brighter than v@xmath1@xmath229.0 and open squares represent the 217 nuclei brighter than v@xmath1=27.5 .",
    "the curved lines are gaussian fits to the data within 2.5@xmath9 ( solid is the fit to data brighter than v@xmath1@xmath229.0 and dashed is the fit to data brighter than 27.5 ) . in both distributions ,",
    "the data are well fit by gaussians out to @xmath33@xmath9 and show a `` tail '' of significant variables extending to higher @xmath9 values . in a normal distribution , we would expect a total of @xmath35 sources to be greater than 3@xmath9 brighter than v@xmath1@xmath229.0 with @xmath31.5 expected to lie brighter than v@xmath1@xmath227.5 .    based on gaussian statistics , we estimate that @xmath312 of our variables ( all detected brighter than v@xmath1@xmath227.5 ) are spurious , implying that the true number of variables is @xmath314 .",
    "if we also correct by 2025% for incompleteness due to lightcurve sampling , the incompleteness corrected number of variables in the hdf is @xmath318 representing 8.3% of the nuclei brighter than v@xmath1@xmath227.5 .",
    "one of the 16 variables detected in this survey , _ 2 - 251.0 _ , was also identified as variable in the i - band variability survey of the hdf ( sgp ) .",
    "eight variables were detected in that survey with significant ( @xmath153@xmath9 ) magnitude changes over the 2 year time interval ( 19951997 ) .",
    "object _ 2 - 251.0 _ is by far the brightest of these sources , having a nuclear v magnitude @xmath313@xmath10 brighter than the next brightest source . of the 7 i - band variables not detected in the present survey , 5 are fainter than v@xmath1=28.0 , placing them below the expected sensitivity limits for this study .",
    "the other two i - band variables , _ 3 - 266.0 _ and _ 3 - 404.0 _ , have v@xmath1@xmath027.0 .",
    "in the present study , object _ 3 - 266.0 _ changed by 0.025 mag ( 1.1@xmath9 significance ) and object _ 3 - 404.0 _ changed by 0.052 mag ( 2.0@xmath9 significance ) .",
    "the latter source is a marginally significant detection and would lie above the 3@xmath9 limit if it had been brighter than @xmath326.5 in the v - band .",
    "3 - 266.0 _ , at just over 1@xmath9 significance , may be variable but at lower significance due to the 2-epoch statistical incompleteness effect discussed above .",
    "figure 6 contains the 1995 v - band images for galaxies with variable nuclei .",
    "the postage stamp images are 3@xmath11 on a side and are scaled to the same maximum pixel value .",
    "it can be seen from this figure and table 1 that the selected galaxies cover a range of morphologies , magnitudes and colors .",
    "their redshifts range from 0.09 to 1.8 with a median @xmath4z@xmath16@xmath00.66 .",
    "many of the galaxies have significant bulge components based to the 2-dimensional model fits .",
    "we note , however , that several sources with b / t@xmath20 also have high chi - square values ( @xmath161.25 ) which in some cases appears to be due to a poorly fit bulge component .",
    "in addition to the morphological b / t parameter , we also list the spectral type for the source based upon the photometry of fly to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies in the hdf .",
    "the selected galaxies appear to be evenly distributed over all spectral classes with no particular preference towards early or late - type galaxies .",

    "the variable nuclei are indicated with larger solid triangles .",
    "the variables cover the full range of v ",
    "i colors and do not appear to be preferentially bluer or redder than the non - varying nuclei of galaxies in the hdf .",
    "all of the variables lie at the bright end of the magnitude distribution .",
    "as previously discussed , incompleteness due to increasing agn light dilution as a function of redshift is likely to contribute to this observation",
    ". however , an astrophysical effect may be at least partly responsible .",
    "agn are generally found in brighter host galaxies than those that do not harbor agn ( huchra & burg 1992 ; ho @xmath7  1997 ; hamilton @xmath7  2002 ) .",
    "if these sources are indeed agn , we might expect to find them in the brighter galaxies .",
    "an additional factor is the inclusion of the agn light in the nuclear magnitude .",
    "we can minimize the above mentioned incompleteness effect by considering only those sources brighter than v@xmath1=26.5 , where incompleteness is not expected to be significant .",
    "we find that 23% ( 5/22 ) of nuclei are variable at 21.8@xmath4v@xmath1@xmath425.5 while only 15% ( 6/39 ) are variable at 25.5@xmath4v@xmath1@xmath426.5 .",
    "while the small numbers do not provide significance , this trend is consistent with the previous studies concerning agn host galaxies .",
    "the hdf has been surveyed with a variety of other telescopes and instruments providing a wonderful resource of multi - wavelength information for this particular region of the sky .",
    "we have cross - referenced our list of variable nuclei with published catalogs of x - ray , radio and far - infrared sources as well as other photometric and spectroscopic surveys used to search for nuclear activity .    agn have long been recognized as x - ray sources , being associated with a wide range of activity levels from the brightest quasars to low - luminosity seyferts .",
    "even highly obscured agn can often be detected at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "some of the light obscured by dust at other wavelengths will be reprocessed and emitted in the mid - ir . for these reasons ,",
    "the x - ray and mid - ir regimes are excellent wavelengths in which to detect and study agn .",

    "of these 22 detections , 18 are included in our variability study .",
    "two were not included because their optical fluxes were too faint to be included in our survey and an additional pair fell too close to the edge of the ccd to obtain accurate nuclear photometry in both epochs .",

    "knowledge of the space density of faint agn at higher redshifts is critical to our understanding of agn evolution and the agn phenomenon in general .",
    "our sample of 16 variable sources spans a redshift range of z=0.1 to 1.8 with most sources lying between z=0.4 and 1.1 .",
    "if we make the assumption that these variables are indeed agn , it is interesting to compare their number density with local samples of agn .",
    "we must first estimate the luminosity of the agn candidates in our survey .",
    "due to the faint magnitudes and small angular sizes of many of the variables , 2-dimensional modeling to separate the components ( disk+bulge+agn ) of the galaxies is difficult and would not yield consistent results for all of the selected galaxies .",
    "a simpler approach is to estimate the agn luminosities by assuming that the entire nuclear flux is attributed to the agn .",
    "this value is an overestimate in one sense since the nuclear light will also include light from the underlying galaxy , though the small nuclear aperture minimizes the contribution from the host .",
    "based on the expected level of variability over this time interval predicted from agn structure functions , we estimate the variable component for our agn candidates to be no less than 15% of the total nuclear light . in the most extreme case , the true agn magnitude could be @xmath32 magnitudes fainter than that measured within the nuclear aperture . in another sense",
    "however , we underestimate the agn flux since we have not applied aperture corrections to include light from the wings of the psf . our aperture of r@xmath20.075@xmath11 encircles about 50% of the flux from a point source ( holtzman @xmath7  1995 ) .",
    "if the point source makes up the entire flux within the aperture , an aperture correction would increase the magnitude by up to @xmath30.8 mag .",
    "if the point source is some fraction of the total nuclear light , the aperture correction will be smaller .",
    "determining the true aperture correction is not possible without knowing the relative fluxes of the point source and host within the fixed aperture .",

    ", a source varying by @xmath14 m would not be detected as variable .",
    "therefore , z@xmath27 is the redshift where the apparent magnitude of a nucleus varying by @xmath14 m falls below the 3@xmath9 variability significance limit shown in figure 4a .",
    "the mean v / v@xmath27 for the 16 nuclei in our survey is 0.67@xmath80.07 . for a population of objects uniformly distributed in space , @xmath4v / v@xmath27@xmath16=0.5 .",
    "our value of 0.67@xmath80.07 indicates that sources are found more often at larger distances than at nearby distances , indicating some evolution in the population of galaxies with variable nuclei .",
    "our survey incompleteness , as discussed in section 3 , affects our ability to detect sources at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath4v / v@xmath27@xmath16 would actually be higher if corrected for this incompleteness .",
    "an increase in the number density would be consistent with the picture of agn / qso evolution at higher luminosities , where the population increases rapidly out to z@xmath03 .",
    "even though evolution may be present among our sample , the small number of sources spread over a range in redshift makes it difficult to construct the luminosity function in more than one redshift bin . to accurately compare the density of our sources to local samples",

    "figure 9 is the lf for hdf variable nuclei in the redshift range z=0.41.1 .",
    "incompleteness due to the fact that our variability selection is based on only 2 epochs is expected to produce an underestimate in the number of agn by a factor of @xmath31.3 , or a decrease in log@xmath30 of @xmath30.12 . for comparison ,",

    "our lf for variable sources at 0.4@xmath4z@xmath41.1 extends to fainter absolute magnitudes than the local lfs , largely due to the fact that the local lfs are calculated for the total galaxy light ( agn+host ) rather than the magnitude of the agn alone .",
    "nonetheless , many of the agn candidates detected in our survey may be truly fainter than those of hb92 .",
    "based on the spectroscopic selection criterion employed by hb92 , most of our sources would not be detected as agn ( see section 6 ) in the hb92 survey . therefore , we assume that the agn component in our galaxies do not comprise as much of the total galaxy light as the hb92 sources and are likely to be intrinsically fainter .",
    "the uh01 lf covers the same integrated galaxy magnitude range as hb92 but shows an overall higher density for local seyferts .",
    "ulvestad & ho explain that this is due to the fact that their lf includes intrinsically fainter seyfert nuclei than does the hb92 sample . for the seyfert 1 galaxies , ho & peng ( 2001 ) decompose the nuclei from the host galaxies in both local samples and confirm this assertion , finding a median nuclear magnitude of m@xmath6=-14.6 for uh01 versus -17.4 for the hb92 seyfert 1 galaxies . from their study",
    ", we also find that the nuclear magnitudes of the local seyferts in both samples can be extremely faint when compared to the total galaxy magnitude , in some cases up to 10 magnitudes fainter .",
    "therefore , an lf consisting of nuclear magnitudes for local seyferts would be a much better comparison to our hdf agn candidates .",
    "since this is not currently available , an alternative is to produce the lf of our sources using the total integrated galaxy magnitude rather than the nuclear magnitude alone ( dashed lf ) .",
    "the integrated galaxy magnitudes for our variable sources cover the same range as the faint end of the local seyfert lfs but have a number density 610@xmath10 greater than the local seyfert density of uh01 .",
    "if the agn in these two samples cover a similar magnitude range , this is evidence for a significant increase in number density from z=0 to @xmath30.7 .",
    "the magnitudes for the uh01 agn determined in ho & peng ( 2001 ) for the seyfert 1 population cover the range -9@xmath15m@xmath6@xmath15 - 22 mag with most lying within -12@xmath15m@xmath6@xmath15 - 20 .",

    "this magnitude range is consistent with that estimated for the uh01 sample .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the increase in number density between the uh01 lf and our lf is due to the inclusion of instrinsically fainter agn as appears to be the case for the difference between the uh01 and hb92 lfs .",
    "finally , we note that the lf for the variable nuclei continues to rise at faint magnitudes , indicating that number counts have not begun to turn over at magnitudes even as faint as m@xmath6@xmath3 - 15 .",
    "the effects of incompleteness in our survey due to agn light dilution would cause us to be less complete at the faint end and corrections in this sense would likely increase rather than decrease our faintest lf bin .",
