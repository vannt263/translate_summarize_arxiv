    "the spreading dynamics of an infectious disease is crucially determined by the population s underlying connectivity patterns .",
    "followed by the renewed interest in graph theory witnessed by statistical physics in the recent years @xcite , substantial progress has been achieved in the field of epidemiology . as an example , the scale - free degree distribution of the internet accounts for the absence of a finite epidemic threshold in the spreading of a computer virus @xcite . the long persistence of hiv is due to the very same topological property of the web of human sexual contacts @xcite , and only targeted immunization leads to a finite epidemic threshold @xcite .",
    "most of these studies are based on the mean - field approximation which represents a reasonable assumption for networks that exhibit large connectivity fluctuations ( that is @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the number of emanating links from a specific node , and the average is taken over the entire network ) .",
    "quite often however , e.g.  in lattice structured populations , spatial correlations become important and heterogeneous mixing has to be taken into account .",
    "matsuda et al .",
    "@xcite first used the ordinary pair approximation for the treatment of a biological problem , and the resulting improvements are considerable .",
    "in addition to the analytical tractability of this approximation , simple estimates for the epidemic threshold can be obtained in terms of a `` dyad heuristic '' : a condition for the location of the critical point is elaborated by looking at two neighbouring infected sites , comparing its recovery with the infections it gives rise to @xcite .",
    "various extensions upon the standard pair approximation have been proposed . in order to analyze the propagation of a wavelike invasion in a lattice structured population",
    ", a remarkable improvement is brought about if the region occupied by the infected individuals is described by the ordinary pair approximation , and the leading edge of the wave front is modelled by the quasi - steady - state pair approximation @xcite .",
    "bauch and rand developed a pair model for the situation where the population s underlying connectivity patterns are of a dynamical nature @xcite .",
    "the grid - like structure or the presence of triangles are topological properties which both the mean - field and the standard pair approximations do not account for .",
    "an approach pursued by different authors is to use parameters that characterize the topology ( such as the density of triangles ) and to make a number of assumptions about the corresponding higher - order correlations , which leads to improved pair models .",
    "van baalen illustrates this method for the triangular and square lattices , if the higher - order correlations are set to 1 @xcite .",
    "the invasion dynamics is reproduced very accurately .",
    "the same strategy can be explored for less homogeneous networks @xcite , and the consequences regarding epidemiological invasions have been discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "the improved pair approximation @xcite takes into account the clustering property of lattice models more precisely .",
    "its key ingredient is to make less restrictive assumptions about the higher - order correlations , for example they can be set to a value not equal to 1 .",

    "our approach conceives the population as a network , with connections between individuals that do not change in the course of time .",
    "each node of the network represents an individual , and every link symbolizes a relationship between individuals that involves repeated contacts , and therefore the transmission of an infective agent proceeds along connections .",
    "real social networks exhibit rich degree distributions , that is vertices can differ considerably in the number of nearest neighbours . as the aim of this paper is the introduction of a methodology that systematically takes into account higher - order correlations , we adopt the simple susceptible - infected - susceptible model and focus on networks where every node has the same number of nearest neighbours . despite the homogeneity of these graphs , there exist several classes of such networks differing in topological properties beyond the degree distribution .",

    "[ fig : tri_dyn ] ) , we also observe a lag between the simulation and the approximations , and the slope during the transient time is slightly improved as one goes from the pair to the triangle approximation .    .",
    "with respect to the pair approximation ( dashed line ) , the description based on the triangle ( solid line ) provides a better approximation of the simulation result ( triangles).,width=377 ]    the strategy outlined at the end of the last subsection can also be applied to the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "in addition to the open triplet probability , the triangle probability is written as @xmath148 one then obtains an analogous correction for @xmath132 involving a parameter @xmath149 denoting the fraction of triplets in closed form which is @xmath150 in the triangular lattice .",
    "interestingly , the simplest elaboration of this approach ( @xmath151 ) reproduces the invasive period reasonably accurate if @xmath149 is chosen larger than its correct value ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "rand also developed improved pair models based on this approach @xcite .    ) .",
    "the upper two curves show the mean - field ( dotted line ) and pair dynamics ( dashed line ) .",
    "the improvement brought about by the triangle approximation ( solid line ) still lags behind the simulation result due to the same reason as in the case of the square lattice.,width=302 ]",
    "we have studied a dynamical model of epidemic spreading where every individual is in contact with an equal number @xmath4 of nearest neighbours .",
    "infected nodes recover spontaneously at a rate 1 , on the other hand , they infect neighbouring susceptible sites at a rate @xmath92 . we have chosen this simple sis - type model since the focus of this article is the introduction of a novel methodology that allows a rather straightforward derivation of the dynamics of higher - order correlations .",
    "the method we propose here consists in choosing a fundamental cluster composed of a certain number of nodes @xmath153 as well as links connecting them .",
    "a definite probability is assigned to each possible configuration of the basic element .",
    "the size of the fundamental cluster represents the range up to which spatial correlations are exactly taken into account . at a level beyond the pair approximation ,",
    "the choice of the basic element is guided by the underlying network s topology . in the case of the square lattice ,",
    "clusters composed of at least one plaquette serve as the fundamental element ; for random networks the local treelike structure is incorporated by using the star as the basic unit .",
    "spatial patterns beyond the degree distribution are therefore embedded in a very natural way by our method . describing the epidemic dynamics of the entire population as a discrete time markovian process ,",
    "the appearing probabilities ( probability that a cluster and its nearest neighbourhood is in a given configuration ) are expressed in terms of the fundamental cluster probabilities .",
    "the continuous - time dynamics emerges as a limiting case ( @xmath64 ) .    with respect to the ordinary ( rather heuristic ) derivation of the mean - field and pair approximation ,",
    "these descriptions are derived with the help of our formalism by using the site or the pair respectively as fundamental clusters in a very automatic way .",
    "independently of the specific choice of the cluster , the binary character of the resulting equations allows for a very efficient solution by the computer .",
    "likewise , a further simplification can be reached if the symmetries which the fundamental cluster probabilites are subject to , are taken into account .",
    "as soon as correlations of range greater than @xmath82 are not ignored , our method yields improved estimates for the location of the phase transition . in the case of the random network , the star approximation already leads to an excellent description of the steady state and the transient dynamics . in the regular counterpart ,",
    "many squares have to be included within the corresponding fundamental unit in order to attain the same level of accuracy .",
    "this is due to the presence of stronger correlations caused by the high local networking .",
    "the method was also illustrated for a triangular lattice and contrasted to approaches that make a certain number of assumptions about the higher - order correlations which lead to improved pair models .",
    "however the novelty of the present work lies in the formalism which essentially consists in a more general starting point and its associated systematic improvability rather than the specific results for the selected epidemiological model and geometrical examples .",
