    "in theorem  [ thm : gen hyp ] we considered `` generalized hyperbolic polyhedron '' , which are the intersection of convex polyhedral surface of projective space with the unit ball , endowed with the hilbert metric .",
    "but we could look at the induced metric on convex polyhedral surface in the `` hyperbolic - de sitter '' space ( an extension of @xmath2 endowed with the hilbert metric ) .",
    "such induced metric can be riemannian , lorentzian or degenerated on different faces and edges . for closed polyhedral surfaces with a finite number of vertices , this is done in @xcite .",
    "the case of convex polytopes in minkowski space is done in @xcite .",
    "the problems of circle patterns on surfaces have deep connections with the geometry of hyperbolic polyhedra .",
    "let us consider the example of the flat torus . roughly speaking ,",
    "if a triangulation @xmath76 of the torus together with numbers associated to the edges are given , satisfying some conditions , then there is a flat metric on the torus ( unique up to scalar multiple ) , a geodesic triangulation isotopic to @xmath76 and a ( unique ) family of circles , centered at the vertices of @xmath76 , and intersecting at an angle given by the given numbers ( this is a _ circle pattern _ on the torus ) .",
    "the relation between circle patterns and hyperbolic polyhedra is as follow . consider a circle pattern of the torus is given , and look at the universal cover .",
    "let us consider him as the horizontal plane at height zero in three - space , and draw above each circle a half - sphere . in the upper - space model of the hyperbolic space ,",
    "those half - circles bound a convex parabolic polyhedron , and the angles between the circles correspond to dihedral angles of the polyhedron .",
    "the triangulation of the circle pattern is the dual of the cellulation of the polyhedron , hence it is simple , and then dihedral angles determine the dual metric : circle pattern problem is reduced to a realization problem . for example",
    "theorem  [ thm : rh ] can be considered as a generalization of the koebe  andreev ",
    "thurston theorem for circle pattern on the sphere ( recall that realization of hyperbolic polyhedra with respect to the dual metric is the same as realization of de sitter polyhedra with respect to the induced metric ) .",
    "there exists a variational proof for existence of circle pattern on compact surface @xcite but the functional was not explicitly known .",
    "actually ( in the torus case ) this functional is the one appearing in the variational proof for realization theorem with respect to the dual metric @xcite .",
    "it is related to the discrete hilbert - einstein functional and uses the volume of hyperbolic polyhedra .",
    "the vertices of the hyperbolic polyhedra constructed from a circle pattern on a compact surface can be inside , on the boundary at infinity , or outside the hyperbolic space , depending on how the circles meet .",
    "close to the scope of this text are the results of @xcite , about circle patterns corresponding to hyperbolic polyhedra with vertices outside of hyperbolic space , but with edges meeting hyperbolic space ( hyperideal polyhedra ) .",
    "circle patterns can be generalized to _ inversive distance circle packings _ , where the inversive distance is a quantity prescribed between two circles with maybe empty intersection .",
    "it the intersection is non - empty , the inversive distance is the intersection angle between the circles , see @xcite and references therein . if the circles are seen on the boundary at infinity of the hyperbolic space , the inversive distance between two non - intersecting circles is nothing but the hyperbolic distance between the two hyperbolic planes defined by the circles .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the results of @xcite could be expressed in terms of hyperbolic polyhedra ( which are now allowed to have edges outside of hyperbolic space ) , and if the functionals used in this paper could be related to hyperbolic volume .",
    "let @xmath6 be the @xmath5-metric induced on a convex polytope of the euclidean space .",
    "by the uniqueness part of theorem  [ thm : alex ] , there does not exist other convex polytope ( up to congruence ) with induced metric @xmath6 .",
    "but we can ask if there exists a convex surface with induced metric @xmath6 ( a convex surface in @xmath2 is the boundary of a convex body ) .",
    "the answer is negative , as it was proved by olovyanishnikov few times after alexandrov proved theorem  [ thm : alex ] .",
    "this result was extended by pogorelov : a convex surface is uniquely determined by its induced metric @xcite .",
    "the induced metric on a convex surface satisfies some convexity conditions .",
    "alexandrov showed that any metric on the sphere satisfying such conditions is realized by a convex surface .",
    "the proof is obtained from theorem  [ thm : alex ] . by approximation by polytopes .",
    "see @xcite for more details",
    ". there does not exist such general results in other spaces as far i know .",
    "convex polyhedra can be seen as a particular case of convex surfaces .",
    "another particular case are convex smooth surfaces , for which many results exist .",
    "the existence part of theorem  [ thm : alex ] is known as weyl problem and was solved by many authors , until papers of nirenberg and pogorelov in the 50 s .",
    "a variational proof was proposed in @xcite , and ivan izmestiev is currently working on it .",
    "the smooth analogue of theorem  [ thm : rh ] was done in @xcite .",
    "@xcite contains the smooth analogue of theorem  [ ref : sphere hyp gen ] .",
    "the smooth analogue of fuchsian results in the hyperbolic space is a consequence of the more general result of @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "fuchsian results in lorentzian spaces were done in @xcite .",
    "the idea of such results seems to go back to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , b,b  ) .",
    "smooth parabolic results are not known for the moment , but a positive answer to the smooth version of question  [ ques bana ] is done in @xcite . note that here `` smooth '' means @xmath88 . for a review of results with assumptions about the regularity of the metric or of the immersion ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath13-metric on the torus .",
    "then there exists a unique hyperbolic metric on a cusp @xmath31 with convex polyhedral boundary such that the induced metric on @xmath91 is isometric to @xmath6 .",
    "the de sitter analogue of theorem  [ thm : par ] provides a statement analogous to the one above @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of such statements is to ask if , for a hyperbolic 3-manifold with convex boundary , the induced metric on the boundary uniquely determines the hyperbolic metric .",
    "here there is no other assumption on the boundary than convexity .",
    "however a reasonable assumption on @xmath92 should be that it admits a complete hyperbolic convex cocompact metric , i.e.  @xmath92 contains a non - empty , compact , geodesically convex subset .",
    "this can be though as an extension of mostow rigidity theorem ( the topology and the induced metric on the boundary uniquely determines the hyperbolic metric on the manifold ) .",
    "a celebrated particular case is the one of induced metric on the boundary of the convex core of hyperbolic manifolds . in this case",
    "the metric on the boundary is hyperbolic .",
    "see the introduction of @xcite for references .",
    "besides if the boundary is asked to be smooth and strictly convex , such a statement was done in @xcite , answering a question of thurston .",
    "the existence part was proved before in @xcite .",
    "partial results for higher dimension manifolds with smooth boundary are in @xcite .",
    "by contrast to the statements of the two theorems above , which concern topologically simple manifolds , it seems to be not possible to make a straightforward polyhedral analogue of the smooth statement of @xcite , because some convex polyhedral metrics could be realized by boundaries of 3-manifolds containing some `` pleated '' faces ( instead of totally geodesic ones ) , see @xcite .    for each of the problems mentioned above ,",
    "a `` dual '' problem can be considered as well .",
    "for example in the case of the boundary of the convex core , the dual statement implies bending laminations on surfaces .",
    "such considerations can be translated in terms of `` globally hyperbolic ads manifolds '' ( a king of analogue of quasi - fuchsian manifolds modeled on anti - de sitter geometry ) . in this",
    "setting , characterization of the dual metric on the boundary of the convex core is done in @xcite , and characterization of the induced metric is the subject of @xcite . for more details about this subject , we send the reader to the review paper @xcite and to @xcite .",
    "recently , the kind of statements mentioned here are extended from the setting of manifolds to the one of `` manifolds with particles '' ( cone - manifolds with singularities along certain geodesics , in particular time - like in the lorentzian setting ) , see @xcite .",
    "such objects appear naturally in the variational proofs for realization theorems , and they are also related to circle patterns problems on surfaces with conical singularities .",
