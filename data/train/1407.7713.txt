    "we name the resulting patterns in the two cases  _ x - soliton arrays _ and _ y - soliton arrays _ respectively for ease of discussion .",
    "these are special cases of possible soliton patterns .",
    "x - soliton arrays are bound solitons moving one after another , while in the case of y - soliton arrays we observe multi - peak patterns along the transverse direction moving as a single front .",
    "all experiments reported here were performed in a single polarisation configuration with the pump and wp co - circularly polarised to minimise polarisation crosstalk  @xcite .",
    "bright polariton solitons are supported by a continuous wave ( cw ) pump resonant with the lower polariton branch at high momentum @xmath3m@xmath4 .",
    "the pump power has to be tuned into the bistability domain and the soliton can be considered as a local switch from the lower to the upper state on the bistability curve .",
    "parametric polariton - polariton scattering from the pump populates soliton harmonics over a broad range of k - vectors . in order to excite x - soliton arrays ,",
    "we apply the elongated wp just at the edge of the gaussian cw pump spot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : basic](a ) ) , i.e outside the region where the pump exhibits bistable behaviour .",
    "the wp is quasi - resonant with the lower polariton branch and its transverse momentum @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 are close to that of the pump : @xmath7m@xmath4 , @xmath8  ev .",
    "full widths at half - maxima ( fwhm ) of the wp are @xmath9 m by @xmath10 m along directions @xmath11 ( soliton propagation direction ) and @xmath12 ( transverse direction ) respectively , and the pulse duration is 5  ps .",
    "as we showed previously , polariton solitons are triggered at wp power densities above a certain threshold  @xcite . at low wp powers only a small region in the centre of the gaussian wp",
    "is expected to excite a single soliton whose size ( healing length ) is determined by the polariton - polariton interactions and the cavity parameters  @xcite . at higher wp powers , the area across the injected polariton wavepacket where solitons may be excited becomes larger than the healing length , so multiple bound solitons are triggered .",

    "the number of created solitons increases with the wp power , as expected . at first , at a wp power of 0.1  mw , only one soliton is excited ( figs .",

    "these peaks become narrower and more pronounced with an increase of the number of soliton humps , which has been predicted theoretically  @xcite .",
    "this narrowing can be understood in the following way  the energy profiles are a fourier transform of the temporal soliton pattern profile .",
    "for example , an infinite array of solitons can be represented by the interference between plane waves with different frequencies , and as a result its energy spectrum will be delta - function like , while in the case of a finite soliton array the peaks in the spectrum will have a finite linewidth .",
    "overall , the k - space and real - space observations indicate the transition to the regime of parametric generation of a long sequence of solitons , theoretically studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have carried out the same measurements and obtained very similar results for different values of @xmath5 and energies , @xmath19 .",
    "the soliton spectrum is broad and is populated by parametric scattering from the pump state which can be triggered by a wp anywhere on the soliton dispersion , thus allowing soliton creation by a wide range of wp energies and k - vectors .    for numerical investigation of the system , we used gross - pitaevskii equations describing coupled te and tm cavity modes interacting with the spin dependent polariton field @xcite and looked for quasi - circularly polarised soliton solutions moving in the direction of the pump momentum ( i.e. along the @xmath11-axis )  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : trainsmod](a ) ) .",
    "the diagram shows that for every given pump intensity ( horizontal axis ) within the bistability range , stable soliton solutions with different numbers of peaks are found depending on the wp power ( vertical axis ) .",
    "an example of a five - peak x - soliton array is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trainsmod](b ) . in our time - dependent modelling",
    "we assumed a gaussian profile of the wp . with an increase of the wp intensity",
    ", there is an increase in the number of peaks in stable multi - peak soliton solutions , see fig  [ fig : trainsmod](c , d ) , in agreement with the experimental results on fig .",
    "[ fig : train](a - e ) .    in practice ,",
    "the profile of the pump beam is gaussian and therefore conditions for the soliton formation are met only within a certain radius around the pump beam center , where the pump intensity is large enough to bring the cavity into the bistable regime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : trainsmod](b ) we compare profiles found in the case of an infinite flat pump with those moving through the gaussian pump .",
    "one can see that in both cases the peak widths and peak spacings are closely matched .",
    "the peak amplitudes , however , differ as the latter structure does not spend sufficient time inside the bistability range to fully stabilise itself .",
    "[ fig : trainsmod](e ,  f ) show how the number and relative position of peaks varies with the wp power for the exactly matched and slightly offset momenta of the pump and wp beams respectively .",
    "[ fig : trainsmod](f ) is in good agreement with the experimental observations on fig .",
    "[ fig : train](e ) ; there is an increase in the number of peaks with increasing wp power and the spacings change in an irregular way with increasing wp power , generally increasing at higher power .",
    "minimising the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath27 ( preferably to zero ) facilitates the generation of a regular pattern of peaks .",
    "the solitons are formed by scattering polaritons from the pump state to populate the soliton spectrum .",
    "the characteristic time of polariton scattering is approximately given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the interaction constant , @xmath30 is the density ( then @xmath31 is the blueshift ) . for a blueshift of 0.3  mev",
    ", about 13  ps are needed to fully populate the spectrum and form a soliton .",
    "the scattering can only occur once the trigger wp reaches the pump bistability area . for a gaussian pump spot",
    ", solitons will only form after they have propagated a certain distance through the pump spot irrespective of how far away the wp is placed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trainsmod](c ,  d ) ) . for this reason ,",
    "when the wp power is high enough to excite a x - soliton array , the solitons in the array tend to appear at approximately the same position relative to the pump bistability boundary , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trainsmod](d ) .",
    "we note localisation along the @xmath11 direction occurs due to the interplay between the negative effective mass and repulsive interactions .",
    "however , we observe that solitons in the x - soliton train are also localised along the @xmath12 direction due to the interaction of propagating fronts combined with the phase - dependent parametric nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we observe an array of two dimensional solitons , travelling one after another .    in the second set of experimental measurements we investigated how localisation along",
    "the _ y _ direction affects pattern formation along this direction .",
    "we elongate the wp along the @xmath12 direction , so it is @xmath32 m along the @xmath11-axis and @xmath33 m along the @xmath12-axis . in this case",
    "we observe breaking of the initially smooth beam profile into a y - soliton array , see fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] .    as with the x - soliton arrays the formation of the patterns only occurs in the soliton regime .",
    "the same experiment when the pump power is below the bistability regime never leads to formation of stable patterns , but to a dispersive wavepacket .",
    "the number of peaks created depends , as for the x - soliton arrays , on the effective spot size of the wp .",
    "[ fig : array](b)-(e ) show real - space images of the emerging structures for different wp powers .",
    "peaks are spaced by @xmath34 m , are of the size ( fwhm ) of @xmath32 m ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : array](f ) ) and travel along the @xmath11 direction within the pump bistability area .",
    "similar to the x - soliton array , increasing the power leads to the creation of additional peaks on the sides of the wp .",
    "it is important to note that the location of solitons triggered in such a way does not depend on the position on the sample : moving the sample by 10  @xmath16 m relative to the laboratory frame does not influence the shape of the array . at the same time moving the wp along the @xmath12 axis relative to the pump and sample , which are fixed in the laboratory frame , leads to the respective shift of the soliton array trajectory .     axis .",

    "[ fig : array ] ) and 3 degrees angle between the wp and pump momenta .",
    "note that this figure is obtained for a single wp phase , while in the experiment we average over all possible wp phases . after averaging phases in the numerical modelling results",
    "are broadened , similar to those seen experimentally . ]    in order to explain the above observations , we have first taken a single hump one dimensional soliton localised along the @xmath11 direction and infinitely extended along @xmath12 and performed its linear stability analysis .",
    "this demonstrated that it was stable with respect to any transverse instabilities , which could lead to filamentation along the @xmath12 direction . if , however , we limit the extent of the soliton stripe by imposing a gaussian profile in the @xmath12 direction , then the change in the curvature of the soliton front leads to changes of the front velocity across the beam profile .",
    "this in turn leads to the breakup of the wavefront and the formation of y - soliton arrays , as in experiment .",
    "the latter process develops faster and is more pronounced if a small angle between the pump and wp beams is introduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : arraymod ] ) .",
    "in the present study we have shown the existence and evolution of dissipative multi - soliton structures .",
    "x - soliton arrays and y - soliton arrays can be triggered by elongating the wp along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions respectively .",
    "increasing the wp effective size ( by changing its power ) leads to the creation of larger structures with more peaks .",
    "x - soliton arrays can be excited across a broad range of initial conditions .",
    "this feature is typical for dissipative systems , where the soliton shape and energy are predetermined by the system parameters rather than the initial conditions .",
    "we note that the physical mechanisms underlying break - up in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions are very different . the formation of y - soliton arrays results from inhomogeneity across a wavefront in the transverse direction .",
    "in contrast , localisation and break - up in the @xmath11 direction manifests a transition from a single soliton regime towards multi - peak parametric generation .",
    "an interesting extension of the study could be to use a wp which is large in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions to observe the formation of more complex solitonic structures , although we have not yet been able to excite such structures due to lack of power density of the wp when it is spread over a large area .",
    "finally we note that from the applied point of view this study sets the framework for analysis of soliton - soliton interactions in digital processing devices where polariton solitons are used as data bits . given the time separation between solitons these devices are expected to operate at speeds equivalent to a few hundred ghz clock rate .",
