    "in 1967 - 73 , the four vela spacecraft ( named after the spanish verb _ velar _ , to keep watch ) , that where originally designed for verifying whether the former soviet union abided by the limited nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 , observed 16 peculiarly strong events ( klebesadel , olson and strong 1973 , bonnell and klebesadel 1996 ) . on the basis of arrival time differences , it was determined that they were related neither to the earth nor to the sun , but they were of cosmic origin .",
    "therefore they were named cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs hereafter ) .",
    "grbs appear as brief flashes of cosmic high energy photons , emitting the bulk of their energy above @xmath0 0.1 mev .",
    "they are detected by instruments somewhat similar to those used by the particle physicists at their laboratories , but the main difference is that grb detectors have to be placed onboard balloons , rockets or satellites .",
    "the konus instrument on _ veneras 11 _ and _ 12 _ gave the first indication that grb sources were isotropically distributed in the sky ( mazets et al .",
    "1981 , atteia et al . 1987 ) . based on a much larger sample , this result",
    "was nicely confirmed by batse on board the _ cgro _ satellite , launched in the spring of 1991 , an instrument that has revolutioned the grb field ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ) . since then , batse is detecting about 300 grbs every year , but only very few can be localized accurately .",
    "the apparent isotropy of the bursts in the sky ruled out the models dealing with neutron stars in the galactic plane , and it was rather interpreted in terms of grbs arising at cosmological distances , although the possibility of a small fraction of the sources lying nearby , within a galactic disc scale of few hundred pc , or in the halo of the galaxy , could not be discarded by that time .",
    "another result was that the time profiles of the bursts are very different , with some grbs lasting a few ms and others lasting for several minutes .",
    "in general , there was no evidence of periodicity in the time histories of grbs .",
    "however there was indication of a bimodal distribution of burst durations , with @xmath125% of bursts having durations around 0.2 s and @xmath175% with durations around 30 s. a deficiency of weak events was noticed in the log @xmath2-log @xmath3 diagram , as the grb distribution deviates from the -3/2 slope of the straight line expected for an homogeneous distribution of sources assuming an euclidean geometry .",
    "all these observational data led many researchers to believe that grbs are indeed at cosmological distances . however , the grb distance scale had to remain unknown for 30 years .",
    "a comprenhensive review of these observational characteristics can be seen in fishman and meegan ( 1995 ) .",
    "it was well known that an important clue for solving the grb puzzle was going to be the detection of transient emission -at longer wavelengths- associated with the bursts .",
    "a review on the unsuccessful search for counterparts prior to 1997 can be seen in castro - tirado ( 1998 ) and references therein . here",
    "i will summarize some results concerning nine selected bursts detected by the _ bepposax _ ( _ bsax _ ) and _ rossixte _ ( _ rxte _ ) satellites in 1996 - 98 . see also piran ( 1999 ) .",
    "this was the first grb for which a precise position ( 5@xmath4 error radius ) was obtained by _",
    "( in ' t zand et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the bright radio - loud quasar 4c 49.29 at @xmath5 = 1.038 lies within the tiny grb error box .",
    "the probability to find such object within the error box is 2 @xmath6 10@xmath7 ( greiner and heise 1997 , piro et al .",
    "1997a ) , but no firm relationship could be established .",
    "the position for this grb was rapidly distributed , allowing to perform deep optical imaging only 19 hr after the high energy event .",
    "no optical variability was found within the error box down to b = 23 , r = 22.5 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1997 , gorosabel et al .",
    "1998a ) . a careful analysis of the x - ray data revealed a weak fading x - ray source within the grb error box ( feroci et al .",
    "1998a ) , but its association to grb 970111 could not be definetively proven .",
    "thanks to _ bsax _ , it was possible on 28 feb 1997 to detect the first _ clear _ evidence of a long x - ray tail -the x - ray afterglow- following grb 970228 .",
    "a previously unknown x - ray source was seen to vary by a factor of 20 on a 3 days timescale .",
    "the x - ray fluence was @xmath1 40 % of the gamma - ray fluence , as reported by costa et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , implying that the x - ray afterglow was not only the low - energy tail of the grb , but also a significant channel of energy dissipation of the event on a completely different timescale .",
    "another important result was the non - thermal origin of the burst radiation and of the x - ray afterglow ( frontera et al .",
    "the precise x - ray position ( 1@xmath4 ) led to the discovery of the first optical transient ( or optical afterglow , oa ) associated to a grb , identified on 28 feb 1997 , 20 hr after the event , by groot et al .",
    "the oa was afterwards found on earlier images taken by pedichini et al .",

    "hst _ observations taken 6 months after the event were reported by fruchter et al .",
    "both the oa ( at v = 28 ) and the extended source ( v = 25.6 ) were seen .",
    "the extended object surrounding the point - source was interpreted as a galaxy , according to the similarities ( apparent size , magnitude ) with objects in the _ hst _ deep field . despite exhaustive efforts in order to get spectroscopic measurements ,",
    "no emission lines were found , implying that the redshift of this galaxy should lie in the range 1.3 @xmath10 @xmath5 @xmath10 2.5 ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the second oa associated to a grb was discovered by bond ( 1997 ) within the grb 970508 error box , and observed 3 hr after the burst in unfiltered images ( pedersen et al .",
    "the optical light curve reached a peak in two days ( r = 19.7 , castro - tirado et al .",

    "optical spectroscopy allowed a direct determination of a lower limit for the redshift of grb 970805 ( @xmath11 ) and was the first proof that at least a fraction of the grb sources lie at cosmological distances ( metzger et al .",
    "the flattening of the decay in late august 1997 ( pedersen et al . 1998 , sokolov et al .",
    "1998a ) revealed the contribution of a constant brightness source -the host galaxy- that was revealed in late - time imaging obtained in 1998 ( bloom et al .",

    "the fluctuations could be the result of strong scattering by the irregularities in the ionized galactic interstellar gas , with the damping of the fluctuations with time indicating that the source expanded to a significantly larger size .",

    "the transient was also detected at 15 ghz ( pooley and green 1997 ) and as a continuum point source at 86 ghz with the iram pdbi on 19 - 21 may 1997 ( bremer et al . 1998 ) . a fe k@xmath16 line redshifted at @xmath5 = 0.835 in the x - ray afterglow spectrum",

    "( remillard et al . 1997 ) and was followed up by _ asca _ and _ rosat _ ( murakami et al .",
    "1997 , greiner et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum as seen by _ asca _ is strongly absorbed ( yoshida et al . 1999 ) , suggesting that the event occurred in a dense medium .",
    "the fact that no optical counterpart down to r = 23.8 was detected between 4 hr and 8 days after the event , could support the idea that the non - detection was due to photoelectric absorption ( groot et al .",

    "the opaque radiation - plasma accelerates to relativistic velocities ( the fireball ) .",
    "the blast wave is moving ahead of the fireball , and sweeps up the interstellar matter , producing an afterglow at frequencies gradually declining from x - rays to visible and radio wavelenghts .",
    "an extensive discussion is given by piran ( 1999 ) .",
    "the properties of the blast wave can be derived from the classical synchrotron spectrum ( ginzburg and syrovatskii 1965 ) produced by a population of electrons with the addition of self absorption at low frequencies and a cooling break ( sari , piran and narayan 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the four main quantities involved are :    \\i ) the synchrotron frequency : the population of electrons has a power - law distribution of lorentz factors @xmath25 following d@xmath2/d@xmath25 @xmath8 @xmath26 above a minimum lorentz factor @xmath25 @xmath27 @xmath28 , corresponding to the synchrotron frequency @xmath29 ;    \\ii ) the break frequency : if the electrons are energetic they will cool rapidly for a break frequency @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath29 , and low energy electrons will have always slow cooling for @xmath30 @xmath32 @xmath29 ,    \\iii ) the self - absorption frequency : synchrotron self absorption becomes important below a critical frequency @xmath33 , and    \\iv ) the maximum flux f@xmath34 .",

    "see for example , wijers and galama ( 1998 ) .",
    "how does the grb take place ?",
    "the fireball model is based on the existence of a `` central engine '' .",
    "however , current observations have been unable to give any insight on this issue .",
    "until 1994 , the number of theoretical models amounted up to 150 ( see nemiroff 1994 ) , but once the cosmological nature of grbs was established , only those models dealing with mechanisms able to produce 10@xmath52 erg in a few seconds were taken into consideration .",
    "they can be classified into two groups :    \\i ) coalescence of neutron stars in a binary system ( narayan et al .",
    "1992 ) : lifes of such systems are of the order of @xmath1 10@xmath53 years , and large escape velocities are usual , putting them far away from the regions where their progenitors were born .",
    "the likely result is a kerr black hole ( bh ) , and the energy released energy during the merger process is @xmath1 10@xmath22 erg .",
    "it is also possible that a @xmath1 0.1 @xmath14 accretion disk forms around the bh and is accreted within a few dozen seconds , then producing internal shocks leading to the grb ( katz 1997 ) .",
    "there are variations of these models where one or two components are substituted for black holes ( paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "\\ii ) a `` failed '' type - i sn ( bodenhaimer and woosley 1983 , woosley 1993 ) or _ hypernova _ ( as it has been called by paczyski ( 1998 ) on the basis of the observational consequences ) : very massive stars ( wolf - rayet ) collapse forming a keck bh and a 0.1 - 1 @xmath14 torus .",
    "the matter is accreted at a very high rate and the energy is extracted via the rotational energy of the bh or via the accretion energy from the disk . in any case , a `` dirty fireball '' , is produced reaching a luminosity @xmath1 300 times larger that than of a normal sn .",
    "this would happen every @xmath1 10@xmath54 yr . in this scenario ,",
    "grbs would be produced in dense enviroments near star forming regions ( see also macfadyen and woosley 1999 ) and grbs might be used for deriving the sfr in the universe ( totani et al .",
    "1998 , krumholz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the existence of x - ray afterglow in _ most _ bursts is confirmed . out ot 15 _ bsax _ pointings , 11 revealed a strong afterglow , and 4 displayed faint ones , leading to the detection of optical / ir / radio counterparts in 1997 - 98 .",
    "very promising seems to be the determination of @xmath5 for the host galaxies by means of absorption edges or emission lines in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "this requires prompt x - ray follow - up , as was achieved for grb 970508 and grb 970828 .",
    "however , only the population of bursts with durations of few seconds has been explored .",
    "short bursts lasting less than 1 s , like grb 980706 , that follow the -3/2 slope in the log @xmath2-log @xmath3 diagram ( in contrast to the longer bursts ) remain to be detected at longer wavelengths .",
    "it is generally believed is that internal shocks produced by the @xmath55central engine@xmath55 are responsible for the @xmath56-ray emission , whereas the slowing down of a relativistic shell on the interstellar medium ( an external shock ) would cause the post - grb emission at longer wavelengths ( the afterglow ) .",
    "energy releases of @xmath1 10@xmath22 erg ( as derived for grb 980329 ) are difficult to reconcile with theoretical models and non - isotropic emission , such as intrinsic beaming appears as the most plaussible resolution of this problem .",
