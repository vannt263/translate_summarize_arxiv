    "the organic superconductors , ( tmtsf)@xmath0@xmath4 s have attracted considerable attention because of their rich variety of phases including superconducting states in spite of rather simple quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) electronic structures .",
    "for example , ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath5 exhibits a pressure induced superconductivity whose pairing symmetry has been expected to be spin - triplet by knight - shift measurements @xcite . meanwhile , ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 is an ambient pressure superconductor , whose knight - shift measurements suggest a conventional spin - singlet pairing @xcite . since the singlet superconducting phase is in close proximity to spin density wave ( sdw ) states , spin - fluctuation has been proposed as a candidate of the pairing glue .",
    "however , the pairing mechanism is still far from an established settlement for ( tmtsf)@xmath0@xmath4 in spite of several theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "synchronous to the theoretical struggle , a number of experimental studies have been also made to clarify the superconducting pairing symmetry for ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature for ( tmtsf)@xmath6clo@xmath1)@xmath7(reo@xmath1)@xmath8 is suppressed by a tiny amount of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite such a result may be evidence of the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap function",
    ". moreover , takigawa _ et al . _ found that the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate lacks a coherence peak below @xmath9 together with a low temperature power - law behavior ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the gap function has line - nodes at which the sign of the gap function changes .",
    "on the other hand , belin and behnia showed that the thermal conductivity rapidly decreases below @xmath11 .",
    "the data leads to the absence of any nodal structures @xcite .",
    "recently , a technique rotating the applied magnetic field has been incorporated in thermal measurements such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity measurements to probe the gap structure including positions of gap nodes in more details @xcite .",
    "the angle - resolved heat capacity measurement is one of such advanced measurements , in which one detects details of the gap structure , especially locations of its nodes by measuring the oscillation of the heat capacity @xmath12 with respect to the applied magnetic field @xmath13 direction .",
    "the rotational dependence on the thermal conductivity is also a powerful tool to examine gap structures similarly . in this paper , we propose kramer - pesch approximation ( kpa ) together with first - principles electronic - structure calculations as a new theoretical tool to analyze the advanced angle - dependent - measurement data @xcite .",
    "kpa significantly exceeds the accuracy level of the previous doppler shift approximation .",
    "we have calculated the density of states ( dos s ) around a vortex by using anisotropic fermi surfaces @xcite obtained by first - principles calculations and compare calculated angle dependences of heat capacity with the experimental data .",
    "very recently , yonezawa _ et al .",
    "_ reported that the oscillation curve of the heat capacity @xmath14 for ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 obtained by rotating the field becomes asymmetric with respect to the crystalline @xmath15-axis in the low temperature and low field range .",
    "@xcite in addition , kink structures are observed near this @xmath15-axis direction .",
    "they claimed , based on the doppler shift analysis , that the asymmetries and the kink structures are clear evidence for the presence of line - nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "a structural phase transition corresponding to an anion ordering was observed at 24 k for ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "shimahara proposed a nodeless fully - gapped @xmath2-wave superconductivity associated with the anion order @xcite .",
    "afterwards , several theoretical studies have suggested effective models with or without the anion ordering to discuss the pairing mechanism .",
    "@xcite however , there has been no first - principles calculation taking account of the anion ordering . here",
    ", we emphasize that a trustful band calculation resolves effects of the anion ordering on the electronic structure .",
    "the present paper has two objectives .",
    "the first one is to analyze the angle - resolved heat capacity for ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 with fermi surfaces obtained by first - principles calculations .",
    "we identify the superconducting gap function by using an expression for the heat capacity on the basis of kpa in a low temperature and low magnetic field range .",
    "the kpa - based expression is applicable to various other unconventional superconductors .",
    "we calculate the heat capacity by assuming the @xmath3-wave , nodeless @xmath2-wave and nodal @xmath2-wave gap functions and compare the results with the measurement data .",
    "the second one is to examine the effects of the anion ordering on the electronic structure of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 .",
    "we clarify the electronic structure , especially fermi surfaces through first - principles calculations using the measured structure parameters in the anion - ordered state .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . the quasiclassical approximation to describe the superconducting state",
    "is briefly introduced in sec .",
    "then , the kpa calculation scheme based on the quasiclassical approach is presented in sec .",
    "we derive a vortex solution using kpa and present an expression of the heat capacity around a vortex .",
    "the electronic structure of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 by first - principles calculations is given in sec .",
    "iv , in which we display the band structure and fermi surfaces .",
    "the calculation results on the angle - dependent heat capacity are shown in sec .",
    "v. the discussion and conclusion are , respectively , given in sec .",
    "vi . and vii .",
    "in many bcs superconductors , the gap - amplitude is much smaller than the fermi energy , @xmath16 . in this case , one can properly use a quasiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "we consider the quasiclassical green s function @xmath17 that has the matrix elements in the nambu ( particle - hole ) space as @xmath18 which is a @xmath19 matrix in the nambu space and is a function of complex frequency @xmath20 , fermi wave - vector @xmath21 , and point @xmath22 in real space .",
    "we set @xmath23 through this paper .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath17 is written as @xmath24 , \\label{eq : eilen}\\ ] ] with fermi velocity @xmath25 and the commutator @xmath26 = \\check{a } \\check{b } - \\check{b } \\check{a}$ ] supplemented by the normalization condition @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 we neglect the vector potential by confining ourselves in type ii limit .",
    "setting @xmath30 with infinitesimal positive @xmath31 , we obtain the retarded quasiclassical green s function @xmath32 . in this paper",
    ", we use a special parameterization form of the quasiclassical green s function to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : eilen ] ) .",
    "@xcite the solution @xmath17 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eilen ] ) can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath15 and @xmath34 are the solutions of the following riccati differential equations : @xmath35 in the parameterization eq .",
    "( [ eq : riccati ] ) , the normalization condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : normal ] ) is automatically satisfied . @xcite    since eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) contain @xmath36 only through @xmath37 , they are reduced to a one - dimensional problem on a straight line , the direction of which is given by that of the fermi velocity @xmath38 .",
    "we consider a single vortex along the @xmath39 axis . because of the translational symmetry along the @xmath39 axis , the pair potential @xmath40 does not depend on @xmath39 in the riccati equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , and hence the riccati equations can be rewritten as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the amplitude of the vector @xmath42 perpendicular to the @xmath39 axis by projecting the fermi velocity @xmath43 and",
    "the coordinate @xmath3 ( @xmath44 ) is along the direction parallel ( perpendicular ) to @xmath45 . for simplicity",
    ", we solve the riccati differential equations under a given form of the pair function .",
    "the density of states is given by @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the real - space average around a vortex where @xmath48 [ @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the fermi - surface area element . by using @xmath51 ,",
    "the low - temperature specific heat is given as @xmath52",
    "we introduce kramer - pesch approximation ( kpa ) as an efficient method to analyze the angle - resolved experiments .",
    "we have shown that kpa gives the zero - energy density of states around a vortex consistent quantitatively with results of direct numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the computational time required for kpa is almost the same as that for the doppler shift method , which is significantly less than that in direct numerical calculations .",
    "furthermore , it is emphasized that kpa can calculate the density of states even in complicated fermi surfaces without any heavy numerical computations .",
    "so far , we have actually examined various unconventional superconductors with the use of kpa @xcite .    in works based on kpa ,",
    "there has been a different way in theoretical treatments on the vortex core .",
    "et al . _ presented an analytical solution describing the anomalous branches in a single vortex with arbitrary winding numbers by generalizing the caroli - de gennes - matricon approach @xcite .",
    "they also demonstrated that the analytical solution on a single vortex is valid even in a higher energy range near the gap - amplitude .",
    "therefore , we incorporate the melnikov s method to calculate the heat capacity . the melnikov s method can be regarded as a perturbation with respect to both energy and imaginary part of the pair - function in the riccati formalism .",
    "now , let us show the present scheme .",
    "first , we briefly mention the doppler shift method in the riccati formalism for comparison .",
    "we separate the pair - potential @xmath40 into the amplitude and the phase @xmath53 as @xmath54 introducing @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the riccati equation is written as @xmath57 assuming @xmath58 , the equations can be exactly solved in an analytical way . the solution is equivalent to that in the bulk region by replacing the energy @xmath20 with the doppler shifted energy @xmath59 .",
    "the doppler shift method is an approximation neglecting the spatial variation of @xmath60 .",
    "then , it breaks down near a vortex core @xcite .",
    "next , we derive the vortex solution by using kpa .",
    "we write down a pair - potential around a vortex in the following form , @xmath61 where @xmath62 describes the spatial variation of the pair - potential . then , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is a pair - potential in the bulk region .",
    "@xmath66 denotes an angle around a vortex and @xmath67 does a direction of the projected fermi velocity @xmath45 @xcite . introducing the variables written as @xmath68 the riccati equations are rewritten as @xmath69 in kpa with the riccati formalism as the previous paper @xcite , we expand @xmath70 and @xmath71 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : asb ] ) and ( [ eq : bsb ] ) with respect to the impact parameter @xmath44 and the complex frequency @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we expand these variables with respect to the imaginary part of the pair - function @xmath72 , in stead of @xmath44 , and the complex frequency @xmath20 on the basis of the melnikov s method .",
    "then , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are defined as @xmath75 following refs .   and , we eventually obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 as @xmath76 with @xmath77 together with the help of the following function , @xmath78 the quasiclassical green s function",
    "is then written as @xmath79 with @xmath80 the quasiclassical green s function has the pole at @xmath81 , which is regarded as energy of quasi - particle .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) and ( [ eq : ct ] ) and setting @xmath30 , the density of states is given as @xmath82 thus , we obtain the heat capacity in the clean - limit ( @xmath83 ) with the use of the kpa written as @xmath84 on the other hand , we set the spatial variation of the pair - potential @xmath62 as @xmath85 with the use of this function , one can integrate eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cc ] ) and ( [ eq : ee ] ) : @xmath86 with @xmath87 where , the function @xmath88 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "now , let us display the electronic structure . in order to calculate the band structure ,",
    "we employ a first - principles density - functional - calculation package vasp@xcite . among available options for the band calculations ,",
    "we adopt gga exchange - correlation energy @xcite and paw method @xcite due to their excellent computational performance as well as accuracy .",
    "the lattice constants and atomic inner - coordinates refer to a measurement report , ref .  .",
    "the calculation self - consistent loops to obtain a converged electronic structure are repeated until the total energy difference becomes smaller than @xmath89 ev . in the loops ,",
    "@xmath90-points are taken as @xmath91 , and the energy cut - off is set to be 500 ev .",
    "once the electron density is obtained after the convergence , the energy bands are again calculated on finer @xmath90-points as 49@xmath9223@xmath9225 in order to determine the fermi surfaces and the fermi velocities accurately as much as possible .    since the employed structural parameters are measured at 7k ,",
    "the data reflects the orientational ordering of the tetrahedral clo@xmath1 anions in the crystal structure of ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath1 .",
    "the ordered structure is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "we obtain the band structure and fermi surface for the structural parameters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] and [ fig : fermi ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] , it is found that the two fermi surfaces almost cross each other since the anion ordering gap is too small to resolve it in the standard scale .",
    "the tiny gap can be distinguished only by an enlarged scope as the inset of fig.3 .",
    "this result clearly suggests that the direction of the clo@xmath1 anion ordering does not have any significant effect on the fermi surface structure contrary to the previous theoretical expectations .",
    "thus , we would like to point out that any theoretical modelings originated from the anion ordering are unlikely to consistently explain recent advanced experimental data .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we study the angle - resolved heat capacity , in which the applied magnetic field is rotated inside the basal @xmath15-@xmath34-plane .",
    "three pairing symmetries are employed to test their matching with the angle - resolved experimental results . for simplicity , we assume that the vortex core is cylindrically isotropic and anisotropy of the critical magnetic field is not present , i.e. , @xmath93 . on the analysis of the vortex core excitation",
    ", we set a spatial cutoff length @xmath94 , which is comparable to the neighboring vortex distance as the magnetic field @xmath95 .",
    "we take the @xmath96-axis ( @xmath44-axis ) parallel ( perpendicular ) to the @xmath15-axis .",
    "it is also noted that @xmath44-axis is parallel to the @xmath97-axis introduced by the ref .",
    "on @xmath15-@xmath34-plane and @xmath20-axis is perpendicular to the @xmath15-@xmath34-plane .",
    "first , we examine a possibility of an isotropic @xmath3-wave gap function . in this case , the oscillation pattern of the angle resolved heat capacity suffers only the fermi surface anisotropy .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] , the heat capacity curve monotonically oscillates with the angle @xmath98 and shows the minima at @xmath99 reflecting the fermi surface anisotropy .",
    "the minima appear as the magnetic field direction is parallel to the @xmath15-axis .",
    "this oscillatory pattern is as one expects , but inconsistent with the latest measurement data in details . in terms of the minima",
    ", we note that the doppler shift method can not resolve even these minima , since the doppler shift method can not describe the fermi surface anisotropy in fully - gapped superconductors .",
    "meanwhile , in the present scheme using kpa , the momentum @xmath25 dependent kernel of the heat capacity ( the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctkpa ] ) ) vanishes as the magnetic field is directed parallel to the fermi velocity @xmath100 , since the projected fermi velocity @xmath42 then becomes zero . in the case of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 ,",
    "the fermi velocity is almost parallel to the @xmath15-axis on the whole fermi surfaces because of the quasi - one - dimensionality .",
    "next , we check a possibility of the nodeless @xmath2-wave gap function proposed by shimahara .",
    "@xcite we employ the nodeless @xmath2-wave gap function expressed as ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gapfull ] ) @xmath101 with @xmath102 where , @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote normalization factors ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 is the second element of the reciprocal lattice vector defined by @xmath110 , @xmath34 denotes the crystal axis @xmath111  , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 denotes the intersection of two fermi surfaces .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nodeless ] , a slightly concave but almost flat - like curve showing the minimum at the center lies around the angles @xmath114 .",
    "these symmetric kink - like curvature including the unclear minimum is due to anisotropy of the fermi surface and the gap function .",
    "close to @xmath115 , the fermi velocity continuously changes its direction around the @xmath15-axis , and the amplitude of the gap function gives the minimum with no change of the gap sign as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapfull ] .",
    "therefore , the angle variation of the magnetic field around @xmath15-axis ( @xmath114 ) is almost lost , i.e. , dos s of the quasiparticles with the small gap do not almost change with the angle .",
    "these results are inconsistent with the measurement data .",
    "finally , we examine nodal @xmath2-wave gap functions .",
    "the trial nodal @xmath2-wave gap functions are classified into three types expressed as @xmath116 with @xmath117 the case i , whose nodes are on both the fermi surfaces , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapnode ] , while the case ii ( iii ) , whose nodes are only on the inner ( outer ) fermi surface .     +   +    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nodal ] , the asymmetric behavior with respect to the @xmath15-axis ( @xmath118 ) direction is found in the case of the nodal gap function ii . paying attention on the curve near @xmath118 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nodalo0mag ] , the kink like structures are observed at around @xmath119 in an anti - symmetric manner .",
    "this calculation using the nodal gap function ii is mostly consistent with the experimental results.@xcite these results suggest that the superconducting gap nodes lie on the inner fermi surface in the 0-th band .",
    "first , we mention the electronic structure including the fermi surfaces . in order to compare the present one with the previous tight - binding models",
    "@xcite , we construct the tight - binding model based on our band calculation taking account of the anion ordering . as shown in fig .  [ fig : tight ] , the obtained tight - binding model is equivalent with that by the band calculation . following the ref .   in terms of the notation for the transfer integrals , the values we obtain are @xmath120 mev , @xmath121 mev , @xmath122 mev , @xmath123 mev , @xmath124 mev , @xmath125 mev , @xmath126 mev , @xmath127 mev , @xmath128 mev , and @xmath129 mev",
    ". these values are much more close to the values obtained by the band calculation without the anion ordering@xcite than those obtained by phenomenologically taking account of the anion ordering .",
    "@xcite therefore , the fermi surfaces shown in fig .  [ fig : fermi ] are found to be qualitatively different from those obtained by the previous tight - binding model considering the anion ordering .",
    "next , we discuss the assumption used in the gap examination , i.e. , the excitation structure around vortex core is isotropic . in the q1d superconductors ,",
    "the superconducting gap amplitude may spatially vary around a vortex . however , low - lying quasiparticle excitations around a vortex are usually less affected by the variation of the gap amplitude than that of the superconducting phase.@xcite our expression on the heat capacity shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctkpa ] ) can contain an anisotropic vortex core through @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , it is a next - step checkpoint for the experimental consistency to investigate effects of the vortex core including the anisotropy .",
    "finally , we discuss the origin of the asymmetric behavior in the curves of the angle - resolved heat capacity . we calculate the partial heat capacity from each fermi surface in the case of the nodal @xmath2-wave gap function i. as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t005 ] , the kink structures of the angle - dependent partial heat capacity are different on each fermi surface at @xmath130 .",
    "this difference originates from that in the fermi velocity of the nodal quasiparticles on each fermi surface .",
    "one finds that the asymmetric behaviors of the partial heat capacity are observed only in the case with the gap - nodes , since the distribution of the direction of the fermi velocity does not have the strong asymmetry on the whole fermi surfaces of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the asymmetric kink structure of the curves measured in the angle - resolved heat capacity is a clear evidence that the gap function has nodes in ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 .",
    "in order to examine the effects of the anion ordering and resolve the superconducting gap function in the organic superconductor ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 , we performed first - principles calculations and developed the quasi - classical theory , respectively .",
    "the first - principles calculation revealed that the anion ordering does not have any important role on the fermi surface shapes in contrast that the gap opening around the crossing point was previously expected as a consequence of the ordering .",
    "the present calculation partly excludes the previous modeling based on the intuitive expectation . on the other hand , using kramer - pesch approximation on the single vortex core excitation together with the fermi surfaces obtained by the first - principles calculations , we constructed the formula calculating the angle - resolved heat capacity in the low - field range and compare the angle dependence obtained from various gap function models with the experimental results .",
    "consequently , we showed that the nodal @xmath2-wave gap function consistently explains the experimental results .",
    "especially , it should be emphasized that only the nodal @xmath2-wave gap function can reproduce the axis asymmetry of the angle dependence .",
    "we thank n. nakai , y. ota , and r. igarashi for helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank s. yonezawa for showing the latest experimental data ."
