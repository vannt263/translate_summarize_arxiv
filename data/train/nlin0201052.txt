    "[ sec - intro ]    this note is a follow - up to @xcite , where we studied a certain family of billiards in the plane .",
    "a billiard  is a dynamical system  defined by the free motion of a material point inside a domain , called the _ table _ , with the prescription that when the point hits the boundary of the table it gets reflected at an angle equal to the angle of incidence .",
    "the family introduced in @xcite was defined as follows : to a three - times differentiable function  @xmath5 , convex , vanishing at @xmath6 ( and thus bounded ) , we associate the table @xmath7 delimited by the positive @xmath2-semiaxis , the positive @xmath3-semiaxis , and the graph of @xmath4 , as in fig .  [ figa ] .",
    "[ figa ]    these billiards are _ semi - dispersing _ , which means that the boundaries of the tables are made of flat and convex parts , when seen from the inside . the main feature of these domains ,",
    "however , is that they are unbounded ; in particular they possess a non - compact _",
    "cusp_.    there are several reasons why models of the like merit study . from a physical point of view",
    "they are on the borderline between _ closed _ and _ open _ systems . by definition ,",
    "a closed system  is one in which the evolution of any representative point in the relevant phase space remains confined within a compact set .",
    "an open system , on the contrary , possesses unbounded s .",
    "our case is borderline in the sense that , albeit open , an arbitrarily small perturbation of the systemwill make it closed .",
    "some suggest these systems be called _",
    "ajar_.    in general",
    "it is reasonable to expect ajar systems to have many unbounded s , in the sense of a positive - measure  set of initial conditions , with respect to a suitable measure .",
    "moreover , if the systemenjoys some stochastic properties ( e.g. , ergodicity ) one might expect that almost all s are unbounded .",
    "what might really discriminate between substantially different dynamics for two distinct ajar systems is the number of _ escape s_. in a few words , an escape   is a trajectory that eventually leaves for good any given compact set of the phase space .    as an example of two opposite behaviors ,",
    "consider a particle in a newtonian potential with total energy zero .",
    "we know that all trajectories , apart from the singular ones that intersect the center of the potential , are parabolas , hence escape both in the past and in the future . on the other hand , the billiard  in fig .",
    "[ figa ] has only one escape   the obvious one that runs along the @xmath2-semiaxis @xcite",
    ".    from a more mathematical standpoint the relevance of our billiards lies in the fact that they give rise to infinite - measure  hyperbolic  dynamical systems , about which not much is known .",
    "we do not delve in this issue here , as a good part of the introduction of @xcite is devoted to it .",
    "let us just mention that , if one is interested in studying the stochastic properties of these systems ( e.g. , ergodicity , as in our case ) , one can not apply the fundamental results of @xcite , where a version of pesin s theory is engineered to be used on _ finite - measure _",
    "hyperbolic  systems with singularities .",
    "other standard results that are denied to us include the estimatates on the measure  of the tubular neighborhoods of the singularities and , what s more , the local ergodicity theorem ( also known as _ fundamental theorem _ ) .",
    "the content of this paper is well summarized by its title : we are presenting a ( fairly large ) class of ergodic  billiards like the above .",
    "in @xcite we expounded the underpinning ideas and technical arguments , but produced only a one - parameter family of examples  those defined by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . here",
    "we extend the result to general perturbations of the above family .",
    "to do so , we need to assume on the reader s side a rather strong grasp on @xcite ( which in turn is heavily based on the seminal article @xcite ) .    after some generalities , outlined in section [ sec - gen ]",
    ", we will verify that a large class of functions @xmath10 satisfies all the general theorems of @xcite , the ones establishing hyperbolicity ; this is done in section [ sec - hyp ] . in section [ sec - erg ]",
    "we will work on ergodicity .",
    "in particular , we will present a lemma that substitutes a corresponding lemma of @xcite and extends its conclusions to our new class of functions .    before moving on to the mathematics proper , it might be worthwhile to recall what we mean by ergodicity here , as this might lend itself to ambiguities in the case of phase spaces of infinite measure .",
    "we say that a dynamical system , endowed with an invariant measure  @xmath11 , is ergodic  when the time average of every integrable function  is constant almost everywhere w.r.t .",
    "@xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "although this is a rather weak notion of ergodicity ( it does not even prevent the existence  of two complementary invariant subsets of infinite measure ) we also have a much more satisfactory result : the ergodicity of the ( finite - measure ) poincar map corresponding to the returns onto the vertical side of the boundary ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ sec - gen ]    in the rest of this note we show that the class of functions defined hereafter yields ergodic  billiards , in the sense mentioned above ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "assume that @xmath12 is three times differentiable , convex , and vanishing at @xmath6 ; and that there exists a function  @xmath13 such that @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 the limit in question is always @xmath17 . in ( h3 ) , @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19-th derivative of @xmath13 .    in practical terms",
    ", this means that @xmath20 is a well - behaved perturbation of @xmath21 , even at the level of a few derivatives ( see lemma [ lemma - simeq ] ) .",
    "the family @xmath8 , @xmath22 , was shown in @xcite to give ergodic  tables and is here superseded by this wider class . that this family is much more general is shown by the next few examples , that are easily checked against ( h1)-(h3 ) .    * @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ; thus @xmath25 . * @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; take @xmath30 .",
    "* @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; use @xmath33 .",
    "not all functions listed above are necessarily positive and convex for @xmath34 , but certainly they become so asymptotically .",
    "the reader is therefore invited to think of them as shifted to the left as much as is needed .",
    "the second of the above examples is actually an instance of a more general result about the family at hand :    the space of sufficiently smooth , positive , convex , vanishing functions that verify _ ( h1)-(h3 ) _ is positive - linear ; that is , a linear combination of elements in the space , with positive coefficients , belongs to the space .",
    "[ prop - lin ]    proof . that the space in question is homogeneous is obvious .",
    "we only need prove that it is additive .",
    "therefore , for @xmath35 , take @xmath36 . to fix the ideas , suppose that @xmath37 .",
    "( h3 ) amounts to saying that , for @xmath38 and @xmath35 , there exist six positive functions @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as @xmath17 . in order to rewrite @xmath42 in terms of ( h1 ) , we choose @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "evidently @xmath13 verifies ( h2 ) .",
    "we show that it verifies ( h3 ) as well .",
    "let us do it only for @xmath46 , the other cases just being analogous . since @xmath47 then @xmath48 ,       \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 but @xmath50 , as @xmath17 ; which gives ( h3 ) when @xmath46 .",
    "the traditional way to study a billiard  problem is to look at the systemonly when the point collides against the boundary of the table .",
    "mathematically speaking , this means that we consider the poincar map defined by the billiard  flow on the cross - section that comprises all vectors of the unit tangent bundle of @xmath51 that point inside @xmath7 ( i.e. , immediately after the collision ) .",
    "the restriction to unit vectors is obvious as the original hamiltonian system  preserves the modulus of the velocity , which is conventionally fixed to 1 .",
    "these vectors are traditionally called _ line elements _ @xcite .    in our case",
    ", the geometry of the table suggests that we further restrict the cross - section to vectors based in @xmath52 , the curved ( dispersing ) part of the boundary , as indicated in fig .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ fige ] later on ) , one can think of working with the billiard  in @xmath54 where the four smooth components of @xmath55 ( together with all unit vectors thereupon based ) have been identified .",
    "this is called a four - copy _ unfolding _ of @xmath7 .",
    "line elements can be parametrized by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , the arc - length along @xmath52 , specifies the base point of the vector , and @xmath58 is the angle that this vector makes with the tangent to @xmath52 there .",
    "we choose the convention that @xmath58 close to zero denotes almost tangential vectors that point towards the infinite cusp .",
    "the billiard  map @xmath59 is defined at all points of @xmath60 that would not end up in a vertex or hit @xmath55 tangentially ; that is , we morally exclude the set `` @xmath61 '' .",
    "in fact , these points make up the discontinuity set of @xmath59commonly called the singularity set , as @xmath59 there is more often singular than not .",
    "it is easy to see that this set , denoted @xmath62 , is the union of two curves , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ figd ] . to conclude this hasty description of the dynamical system  at hand",
    ", we recall that @xmath59 preserves the measure@xmath65 .",
    "more details are available in @xcite .",
    "[ sec - hyp ]    in order to show that a given billiard  is ergodic  we must first prove that the associated dynamical system  @xmath66 has a hyperbolic structure .",
    "this means that for @xmath11-almost every point @xmath67 , there is a local stable and unstable manifold ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.1 ) , and the resulting foliations are absolutely continuous w.r.t.@xmath11 .",
    "sections 67 of @xcite do precisely that , provided @xmath10 satisfies five assumptions that we list as soon as we have given some necessary notation .",
    "[ fige ]    in @xmath54 , for @xmath68 , consider the straight line passing through @xmath69 and tangent to @xmath51 ( i.e. , to the part of @xmath70 that lies in the first quadrant ) .",
    "denote by @xmath71 the abscissa of the tangency point .",
    "this is uniquely determined by the equation @xmath72 then denote by @xmath73 the abscissa of the point at which this line intersects @xmath70 in the second quadrant .",
    "this number is given by the solution of @xmath74    in the sequel , for @xmath75 , we use the notation @xmath76 to indicate that there is constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 , as @xmath17 ; likewise for @xmath79 .",
    "also , @xmath80 means that , when @xmath17 , @xmath81 is bounded away from 0 and @xmath6 ; whereas @xmath82 means that @xmath83 .",
    "the five assumptions read as follows : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88    we now prove a result that will make it simpler to check that our functions verify ( a1)-(a5 ) .    for any positive @xmath10 as in _",

    "for @xmath94 we have only one asymptotic bound , as @xmath95 might vanish somewhere .",
    "now , checking ( a3 ) and ( a4 ) is immediate . for ( a1 ) we apply ( h2 ) to @xmath96 . for ( a5 ) we may select any @xmath97 : then the assertion is given by applying ( h2 ) to @xmath98 .",
