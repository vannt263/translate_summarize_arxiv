    "these two objects remained unique until the late 1990 s , when new sky surveys began revealing significant numbers of similar objects in the field .    in 1997 , several gd  165b  like objects were discovered from two near  infrared sky surveys , the two micron all  sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) and the deep near  infrared survey ( denis ; @xcite ) , as well as a southern hemisphere proper motion survey ( @xcite ) . in 1999 , several gl  229b  like brown dwarfs were found in the commissioning data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the 2mass database ( @xcite ) , and the new technology telescope deep field ( @xcite ) .",

    "these transformations can not be applied to the colors of t dwarfs because of their very structured flux distributions within the filter bandpasses , and t dwarf colors must be transformed by convolving the flux distributions with the filter profiles , as described in  3.3 .",
    "the filter profiles and calibrated flux distributions for m , l , and t dwarfs can be obtained from the authors upon request . the photometric system used in this paper is calibrated by adopting zero magnitude at all wavebands for vega ; an infrared spectrum of vega is also available on request .",

    "the telescope was offset slightly between exposures , adjacent pairs of frames were subtracted to remove the rapidly varying and high background , and every four pairs of differenced images were combined and divided by a flat field .",

    "we summarise our observed @xmath5@xmath3 and @xmath5@xmath4 colors as a function of spectral type and estimated effective temperature .",
    "we also compare the observed colors to those calculated by two models which handle grain condensation ( dust ) differently .",
    "these are the models of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs with dusty atmospheres by @xcite , and the models of brown dwarfs in which dust is treated as if condensed below the photosphere by @xcite .",
    "these structural models provide constraints on surface gravity as a function of age and temperature , and the two models give consistent results for age , temperature and gravity .",
    "the range of age or gravity for the calculated colors are given at the bottom of the table .",
    "table 8 shows that the @xmath5@xmath3 colors for l dwarfs calculated by chabrier et al .",
    "agree reasonably well with our observations . for",
    "t dwarfs their calculated @xmath5@xmath3 colors are redder than observed while those of burrows et al .",
    "more closely match our observations .",
    "the @xmath3 bandpass used here has a bluer cut  on wavelength than that used by either model  compare for example the bandpass shown in figure 1 to that of @xmath56 in figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "our bandpass will include some of the ch@xmath7 absorption seen in late l and t dwarfs ( see also  5.1 ) .",
    "@xcite show that this difference in bandpass can lead to the model @xmath5@xmath3 colors being redder by 0.1  mag for late l dwarfs and by 0.2  mag for mid ",
    "t dwarfs ; we have confirmed the latter by tests using the observed gl  229b spectrum .",
    "the large discrepancy between the observed @xmath3 fluxes of t  dwarfs and those predicted from the models of chabrier et al .",
    "( 1.3  mag at t6 ) is most likely due to their treatment of dust ; the authors acknowledge that dust grains are more likely to exist below , rather than within , the photosphere of t dwarfs , as is assumed by the burrows et al . models .",
    "the observed @xmath5@xmath4 colors of l and t dwarfs are bluer than calculated by either model .",
    "the absolute @xmath5 magnitudes predicted by the models are consistent with our measurements , at least for the small sample of l and t dwarfs with known parallaxes .",
    "thus , if the predicted @xmath5@xmath22 colors are too red , then the predicted @xmath22band fluxes are likely to be too large . for t dwarfs ,",
    "the @xmath5@xmath4 discrepancy of @xmath481.0  mag implies that the models of both @xcite and @xcite predict around three times the observed @xmath22band flux .",
    "this is disappointing as model calculations had suggested that the 5@xmath14 m region would be the preferred wavelength for brown dwarf studies using planned space instruments ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancy found here implies that achieving this goal will require higher sensitivity than originally thought .",
    "differences in the @xmath22 filter passbands used for the model calculations and the observations can not explain the discrepancy .",
    "the @xmath4 filter used here has half  power wavelengths of 4.57  @xmath14 m and 4.80  @xmath14 m ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the typical @xmath22 filter has a half  power bandpass defined by the wavelength range 4.505.00  @xmath14 m ( see figure 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "no strong features are expected in the spectra of the a0 calibration star or t  dwarfs within these wavelength ranges ; for t dwarfs h@xmath9o absorption will be important longward of the @xmath22 band and co absorption is not expected as all the carbon should be in the form of ch@xmath7 ( but see the discussion below ) .",
    "allard ( 2001 , private communication ) , using models similar to those in chabrier et al . , finds no significant difference between @xmath5@xmath22 and @xmath5@xmath4 .",
    "calculations we have done with model spectra made available to us by f. allard and p. hauschildt , and by d. saumon and m. marley , show the flux through the @xmath22 and @xmath4 filters differs only by 4% at @xmath57  k and 9% at @xmath58  k. tests using the observed spectrum for the t dwarf gl  229b imply the effect to be larger but still only 20%",
    ".    the models of @xcite and @xcite make very different assumptions about the presence of dust in the photosphere , however , while they calculate very different @xmath5@xmath3 colors at @xmath59  k , their @xmath5@xmath4 colors are very similar .",
    "hence it seems that dust does not cause the @xmath4 discrepancy observed here .",
    "another possible uncertainty in the models is treatment of molecular opacities . @xcite and @xcite have detected co absorption features in the @xmath22band spectrum of the t6 dwarf gl  229b .",
    "the implied abundance of co in the photosphere of gl  229b is much greater than that expected under conditions of thermochemical equilibrium ( @xcite ) .",
    "this overabundance of co may be the result of vertical mixing in the atmosphere , a condition not included in the models of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "opacity from co , and/or the change in the temperature  pressure structure of the atmosphere introduced by mixing , may at least partly account for the @xmath22band discrepancy between observations and models . convolving the @xmath4 filter profile with the gl  229b spectrum of noll et al .",
    "1997 shows that the co absorption bands reduce the @xmath60 flux by @xmath210.4  mag ; convolving with the wider @xmath22 filter shows the effect to be @xmath210.7  mag .",
    "the latter is close to the observed discrepancy if @xmath61  k ( see table 8) . further study is clearly warranted .",
    "we present @xmath0 photometry for a sample of 58 late ",
    "m , l , and t  dwarfs , most of which have been classified spectroscopically by g02 . a well  defined but relatively new photometric system is used ; differences between this and previous near  infrared systems are significant at around the 5% level , but in the case of the t dwarfs the difference at @xmath19 is @xmath2130% and at @xmath3 and @xmath62 it is @xmath2120% .",
    "differences between photometric systems must be taken into account when comparing infrared colors of l and t dwarfs taken from the literature .",
    "we have determined effective temperatures and bolometric corrections where possible , to show that @xmath63  k for l dwarfs and @xmath64  k for the known t dwarfs .",
    "the temperatures derived for late ",
    "l dwarfs are consistent with the expected co to ch@xmath7 transition temperature in brown dwarf atmospheres ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that a filter centered around @xmath65 m ( e.g. , ukirt @xmath1 ) is well suited for measuring the fluxes of brown dwarfs in a region where their energy distributions are rapidly rising .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1 filter is useful for flux calibrating red spectra , as long as the bandpass is accurately known . on the other hand , the pressure  broadened wings of the k  i resonance doublet at @xmath66 m and the increasing water absorption in the @xmath19band cause @xmath1@xmath19 to saturate at @xmath67 for l and t dwarfs .",
    "therefore , @xmath1@xmath19 is not useful as a discriminator of brown dwarf spectral type .    the onset of ch@xmath7 absorption at the l ",
    "t spectral boundary ( see g02 ) causes the @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath20@xmath5 colors of t  dwarfs to become progressively bluer , overlapping the color space occupied by m dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath68band color trends of late ",
    "m , l , and t dwarfs show that , although sdss and 2mass broadband colors together are superb for identifying _ candidate _ brown dwarfs , confirmation and classification of all but the later t  dwarfs require follow  up spectroscopy or longer baseline photometry .",
    "we find significant scatter in the @xmath2 colors of both l and the later t dwarfs .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath2 magnitudes of l dwarfs are sensitive to the presence and composition of dust clouds in their photospheres .",
    "we also suggest that the @xmath5 magnitudes of t dwarfs are sensitive to variations in gravity and/or metallicity which affect the strength of the pressure ",
    "induced h@xmath9 opacity in this band . the observed scatter between color and spectral type",
    "may imply that there is not a unique relationship between effective temperature and spectral type ; more bolometric luminosities are needed to determine whether this is true .",
    "we find that @xmath5@xmath3 increases monotonically through most of the m , l , and t classes .",
    "a color degeneracy of @xmath5@xmath69 exists between spectral types l6 and t5 , most likely due to ch@xmath7 absorption at the blue edge of our @xmath3 bandpass , which has been shown by @xcite and @xcite to be detectable for spectral types around l6 and later .",
    "this limits the usefulness of @xmath5@xmath3 as an indicator of effective temperature .",
    "of all the color  color combinations spanned by our near  infrared photometry , @xmath19@xmath5 versus @xmath5@xmath3 is the best discriminator of late ",
    "m , l , and t spectral types .",
    "except for dwarfs near the l  t boundary , the dwarfs in our sample can be classified photometrically in this color space within one or two subclasses .",
    "we have obtained accurate @xmath4 magnitudes for two l dwarfs and two t dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath22band fluxes for t dwarfs deduced from our photometry are around three times fainter than predicted by current atmospheric models .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused in part by increased opacity due to a higher than expected photospheric abundance of co , as has been detected by @xcite and @xcite for gl  229b .",
    "this discrepancy demonstrates the need for improved models of substellar atmospheres and for more 5  @xmath14 m spectroscopic data , although the results presented here show that such observations will be more difficult than anticipated .",
