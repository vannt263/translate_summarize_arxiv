    "the so - called number problem in the context of solar flares refers to the high number of accelerated electrons necessary in order to explain spectral observations of hard x - ray ( hxr ) radiation from the solar corona @xcite . for a number density of @xmath5 m@xmath6 and a solar flare particle acceleration volume of @xmath7 mm@xmath8 ,",

    "it investigates the interplay between particle collisions as well as langmuir wave generation and absorption .",
    "qualitatively , the main argument states that a langmuir wave , that has been generated by an electron of a given energy , will have a wavenumber @xmath10 corresponding to that electron s energy .",
    "a positive density gradient in the direction of wave propagation will cause a decrease of the wavenumber , and hence higher phase velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath10-shifted wave is then subject to absorption by a faster electron .",
    "the overall effect is an increased number of high energy electrons in the energy spectrum .",
    "while the quasi - linear approach allows simulations for long time scales , fully kinetically self - consistent dynamics of the phase space distribution function of the electron population remains inaccessible .",

    "the beam electrons are not replenished , i.e. there is only an injection at @xmath28 and no further electrons are being added at any other point in the simulation . as a result of the above defined quantities , at @xmath32 ,",
    "the plasma beta is @xmath33 .",
    "the mass ratio used is @xmath34 .",
    "we will consider cases where the beam density is uniform in the plasma box , as well as cases where the beam is spatially localized .",
    "each particle species ( background electrons , ions , and beam electrons ) is represented by @xmath35 pseudo particles per cell .",
    "the boundaries of the simulation box in the perpendicular directions ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are periodic for waves and particles alike , however , along the @xmath14-axis boundaries are periodic for particles , but we use open boundaries for waves . on one hand , this allows us to keep the total number of beam particles constant throughout the simulation . on the other hand , waves that were generated at the boundaries of the simulation box and travel through the boundary will not be re - introduced at the other side",
    "this is particularly important in runs with density gradients , because , if periodic boundary conditions were being used , these waves would encounter a sudden ( non - physical ) change in background density at the boundary and interact via refraction .",
    "moreover , these waves would spread out into the simulation box and interfere with the results .",
    "this does introduce loss of energy that is carried by waves that escape the simulation box , but the loss does not turn out to be significant . in order to be able to compare runs with different background plasma frequencies , we will normalize all units ( where appropriate ) to the above defined quantities .",

    "in this section , a beam of constant density is injected evenly distributed in the simulation box .",

    "for the constant density case , a beam to plasma ratio of @xmath48 was chosen .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath49 were determined by making sure that @xmath49 and the average langmuir wave growth rate , @xmath50 , are equal in all runs .",
    "this ensures that the runs are comparable , as the same amount of energy is injected into the plasma in all runs , while the overall growth rate for the langmuir waves is also equal in all runs .",
    "naturally , in the non - zero gradient runs , local growth rates will differ from the overall rate .",
    "furthermore , epoch requires the grid size to be smaller or equal to the debye length .",
    "the grid size is set to be constant throughout the box and its value was set in the previous section . as a result , the density at the right edge of the simulation box is set to the maximum density , @xmath51m@xmath6 , fulfilling the requirement everywhere .",

    "this current will cause a standing wave , visible in the @xmath54-component of the electric field .",
    "the frequency of this wave is the local electron plasma frequency .",
    "it is possible to start from a zero current situation by introducing a backward drift of the background plasma to balance out the current produced from the beam electrons .",
    "however , the local backwards drift would be a function of the local beam - to - background electron ratio , @xmath55 , and in the case of background density gradients , it would also cause different parts of the background plasma to drift at different velocities , which would influence the simulation results .",
    "effectively , denser regions would be drifting slower than less dense ones , which would distort the density profile more and more over the course of the simulation , making the analysis of the role of the density gradient impossible .",
    "therefore , we would like to keep simulations with different background density profiles as comparable as possible , changing only a minimal amount of parameters .",
    "conveniently , it turns out that the amplitude of the wave , which is being generated by the non - zero initial current , is overpowered by the generated langmuir waves in all runs , when given enough time for the beam - plasma instability to take effect .",
    "+      movie 1 in ref.@xcite shows the evolution of the beam and background densities over the course of the simulation .",
    "we can see that despite the constant density ratios everywhere , wave growth occurs first from the left side of the simulation box .",

    "<S> a possible solution to the unexplained high intensity hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission observable during solar flares was investigated via 3d fully relativistic , electromagnetic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations with realistic ion to electron mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> a beam of accelerated electrons was injected into a magnetised , maxwellian , homogeneous and inhomogeneous background plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the electron distribution function was unstable to the beam - plasma instability and was shown to generate langmuir waves , while relaxing to plateau formation . in order to estimate the role of the background density gradient on an unbound ( infinite spatial extent ) beam , three different scenarios were investigated : a ) a uniform density background ; b ) a weak density gradient , @xmath0 ; c ) a strong gradient case , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote background electron densities on the left and right edges of the simulation box respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the strong gradient case produced the largest fraction of electrons beyond @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> further , two cases ( uniform and strong gradient background ) with spatially localized beam injections were performed aiming to show drifts of the generated langmuir wave wavenumbers , as suggested in previous studies . for the strong gradient case , the langmuir wave power is shown to drift to smaller wavenumbers , as found in previous quasi - linear simulations . </S>"
