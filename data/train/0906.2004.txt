    "moreover , for sources where the mid - ir emission is extended , using a point - source extraction method would likely result in an overestimate of the flux densities , due to the slit loss correction function applied .",
    "this would consequently affect the sed of the galaxy .    for most of the data reduction in this paper , we used the cube builder for irs spectra maps ( * ? ? ?",

    "spectral cubes were built using cubism from the irs maps .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by differencing the on and off source observations of the same order in each module ( sl and ll ) .",
    "the observations from pid 3269 were designed to minimize redundancy and maximize the number of sources that can be observed using a limited amount of telescope time . as a result these maps consisted of only 13 steps in sl and 5 steps in ll with no repetition and for a source with extended mid - ir emission , the small map may not encompass the entire source , e.g. ngc1365 . to obtain an accurate sed from the extracted region of the galaxy",
    ", one needs to ensure that the same fraction of source fluxes at all wavelengths is sampled .",
    "since the point spread function ( psf ) changes from 5 to 35@xmath0 m , we adopted an image convolution method to account for the change in the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the psf : 2-dimensional images at each wavelength were convolved to the resolution at the longest wavelength ( 35@xmath0 m )",

    "a number of tests with varying sizes for the spectral extraction aperture were performed in order to select the optimum size .",
    "an aperture of 4@xmath153 pixels in ll was adopted , which corresponds to an angular size of 20.4@xmath16@xmath1515.3@xmath16 . then a complete 535@xmath0 m spectrum of all galaxies centered on their nucleus was extractedm spectra were obtained . ] . the main motivation behind this choice was to ensure that we could produce an accurate overall sed of the extracted region , even in cases where the emission was extended .",
    "this was essential so that we have a reliable measurement of the continuum emission , in order to calculate the mid - ir slope , and to estimate the strength of the silicate features .",
    "further tests were performed by extracting just the sl spectra of the sample using the smallest aperture possible ( 2@xmath152 pixels in sl or 3.6@xmath18 ) .",
    "it was found that , in general , the measured fluxes and ews of the pah features did not differ more than 20% from the integrated spectra over the larger apertures , which indicates that these objects are likely to be less than 20% more extended than the point - spread - function of point sources .",
    "this suggests that most of the sources were not very extended in the mid - ir and more than 80% of their flux originates from a point source unresolved to spitzer .",
    "scaling the spectra between different orders and modules was not needed for most of the cases , and when an order mismatch was detected , the sl spectra were scaled to match ll . in table",

    "a histogram of the physical size of extraction aperture for the whole sample is presented in figure [ fig : size_hist ] with the dotted line , while in the same figure , we also show the distribution for sources that are observed in spectral mapping mode with the solid line .",
    "all the sources that are extracted from a projected size of more than 20  kpc are observed using the staring mode and reduced with point - source extraction method .    for data obtained with the irs staring mode ,",
    "the reduction was done in the following manner .",
    "we started from intermediate pipeline products , the `` droop '' files , which only lacked stray light removal and flat - field correction .",
    "individual pointings to each nod position of the slit were co - added using median averaging . then on and off source images were differenced to remove the contribution of the sky emission .",
    "spectra from the final 2-d images were extracted with the spectral modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a point source extraction mode , which scaled the extraction aperture with wavelength to recover the same fraction of the diffraction limited instrumental psf .",
    "note that since the width of both the sl and ll slits is 2 pixels ( 3.6@xmath16 and 10.2@xmath16 respectively ) , no information could be retrieved along this direction from areas of the galaxy which were further away .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated using the irs standard star @xmath19 lac , for which accurate template was available @xcite .",
    "finally , using the first order of ll ( ll1 , 2036@xmath0 m ) spectrum to define the absolute value of the continuum , the flux calibrated spectra of all other low - resolution orders were scaled to it .    for nine sources in the 12@xmath0 m seyfert sample , both spectral mapping and staring mode observations had been obtained and were available in the ssc data archive . for these galaxies ,",
    "the spectra were extracted following the above mentioned recipes for all observations . in order to ascertain again",
    "how extended the emission from these source was , we compared the resulting spectra of the same source . with two exceptions , ngc4151 and ngc7213 , all other seven spectra obtained in staring mode required a scaling factor larger than 1.15 between the sl and ll modules .",
    "this further suggests that the nuclear emission in those sources is indeed extended , and point - source extraction may not be appropriate . for galaxies with only staring mode observations , we also checked the difference between the overlap region ( @xmath20 m ) in the sl and ll modules .",
    "none of them require a scaling factor more than 1.15 , suggesting that those objects are point - like at least along the direction of the irs slits .",
    "it has been well established that the mid - ir spectra of seyfert galaxies display a variety of features ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this is understood since , despite the optical classification of their nuclear activity , emission from the circumnuclear region , as well as of the host galaxy , also influences the integrated mid - ir spectrum of the source .",
    "our complete 12@xmath0 m selected seyfert sample provides an unbiased framework to study the statistics on their mid - ir properties .",
    "earlier work by @xcite on just 51 agn from this sample presented a grouping of them based on their continuum shapes and spectral features . in this section ,",
    "we explore the global shape of the mid - ir spectra for the complete spitzer / irs set of data on the 12@xmath0 m seyferts .",
    "we examine if the average mid - ir spectrum of a sy 1 galaxy is systematically different from that of a sy 2 .",
    "the irs spectra for 47 sy 1s and 54 sy 2s with full 5.5 - 35@xmath0 m spectral coverage , normalized at the wavelength of 22@xmath0 m , are averaged and plotted in figure [ fig : avespect ] . for comparison ,",
    "we over - plot the average starburst template from @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the mid - ir continuum slope of the average sy 1 spectrum is shallower than that of sy 2 , while the starburst template has the steepest spectral slope , indicating a different mixture of hot / cold dust component in these galaxies ( also see * ? ? ?",
    ". this would be consistent with the interpretation that our mid - ir spectra of sy 2s display a strong starburst contribution , possibly due to circumnuclear star formation activity included in the aperture we used to extract the spectra from , consistent with the findings of @xcite that star formation is extended and it is not a purely nuclear phenomenon .",
    "pah emission , which is a good tracer of star formation activity @xcite , can be detected in the average spectra of both seyfert types , while it is most prominent in the average starburst spectrum .",
    "pah emission originates from photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) and can easily be destroyed by the uv / x - ray photons in strong a radiation field produced near massive stars and/or an accretion disk surrounding a smbh @xcite . in the 12@xmath0 m seyfert sample ,",
    "we detect pah emission in 37 sy 1s and 53 sy 2s , that is 78% and 93% for each type respectively .",
    "this is expected since the apertures we used to extract the mid - ir spectra for the 12@xmath0 m sample correspond in most cases to areas of more than 1  kpc in linear dimensions ( see figure [ fig : size_hist ] ) . as a result ,",
    "emission from the pdrs associated with the extended circumnuclear region and the disk of the host galaxy is also encompassed within the observed spectrum .",
    "high ionization fine - structure lines , such as [ nev]14.32@xmath0m/24.32@xmath0 m , are clearly detected even in the low - resolution average spectrum of sy 1 .",
    "this signature is also visible , though rather weak , in the average spectrum of sy 2 , while it is absent in the average starburst template . due to photons of excitation energy",
    "higher than 97ev and typically originating from the accretion disk of an agn , [ nev ] serves as an unambiguous indicator of an agn . even though the low - resolution module of irs was not designed for studying fine - structure lines , we are still able to detect [ nev ] emission in 29 sy 1s and 32 sy 2s , roughly 60% for both types .",
    "another high ionization line , [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m , with ionization potential of 54ev , also appears in both seyfert types ( 42 sy 1s and 41 sy 2s ) , and is stronger in the average spectrum of sy 1 .",
    "the [ oiv ] emission line can be powered by shocks in intense star forming regions or agns ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in our sample",
    "it is probably powered by both , given the large aperture we adopted for spectral extraction .",
    "more details and a complete analysis of mid - ir fine - structure lines for 29 galaxies from the 12@xmath0 m seyfert sample are presented in @xcite , while the work for the entire sample is in progress ( tommasin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "an atlas with mid - ir low - resolution spectra of the 12@xmath0 m seyfert sample is included at the end of this paper .",
    "we find that a fraction of our sources show a flattening or a local maximum in the mid - ir continuum at @xmath1420@xmath0 m , which had also been noted as a `` broken power - law '' in some seyfert galaxies by @xcite .",
    "another more extreme such case was the metal - poor blue compact dwarf galaxy sbs0335 - 052e @xcite , and it was interpreted with the possible absence of larger cooler dust grains in the galaxy .",
    "since the change of continuum slope appears at @xmath1420@xmath0 m , we use the flux ratio at 20 and 30@xmath0 m , f@xmath21/f@xmath22 , to identify these objects .",
    "after further examination of the spectra , we find 15 sy 1s and 4 sy 2s , which have a f@xmath21/f@xmath22@xmath230.95 .",
    "we call these objects `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' .",
    "to analyse the properties of `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' , we plot the average irs spectra of the 19 sources in figure [ fig : ave_peaker ] .",
    "as most of these sources are type 1 seyferts ( 15 out of 19 ) , we also overplot the average sy 1 spectrum for comparison .",
    "in addition to their characteristic continuum shape , a number of other differences between the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' and sy 1s are also evident .",
    "pah emission , which is clearly detected in the average sy 1 spectrum , appears to be rather weak in the average `` 20@xmath0 m peaker '' spectrum .",
    "the high - ionization lines of [ nev ] and [ oiv ] are seen in both spectra with similar strength , while low - ionization lines , especially [ neii ] and [ siii ] , are much weaker in the average spectrum of `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' .",
    "if we calculate the infrared color of a galaxy using the ratio of f@xmath24/f@xmath25 ( see section 3.3 for more detailed discussion on this issue ) , we find an average value of 0.75 for the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' , while it is 0.30 for the other `` non-20@xmath0 m peaker '' sy 1s in the 12@xmath0 m sample . finally , the average ir luminosities of the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' and sy 1s do not show significant difference , with log(l@xmath26)=10.96 for the former and log(l@xmath26)=10.86 for the latter .",
    "these results are consistent with the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' being agns with a dominant hot dust emission from a small grain population heated to effective temperatures of @xmath14 150k and a possible contribution due to the distinct emissivity of astronomical silicates at 18@xmath0 m",
    ". their radiation field must also be stronger than a typical sy 1 , since it destroys the pah molecules around the nuclear region more efficiently .",
    "we should stress that unlike sbs0335 - 052e , whose global ir sed peaks at @xmath1430@xmath0 m , and likely has limited quantities of cold dust , the mid - ir peak we observe in these objects at @xmath1420@xmath0 m is likely a local one / f@xmath271 .",
    "this becomes more evident in figure [ fig : peaker_sed ] , where we also include the scaled average 60 and 100@xmath0 m flux densities for the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' .",
    "it is clear that their far - ir emission increases with wavelength , thus confirming the presence of ample quantities cold dust in these objects . to contrast the global sed of these objects with the whole seyfert sample",

    "all seds have been normalized as in figure [ fig : avespect ] at 22@xmath0 m . unlike the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' one can easily observe the regular increase of the flux from @xmath1415 to 60@xmath0 m in the average sy 1 and sy 2 seds .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the dust properties of the `` 20@xmath0 m peakers '' in comparison with typical active galaxies will be presented in a future paper .      in this section ,",
    "we explore some of the properties of the pah emission in our sample and contrast our findings to the previous work . to quantify the strength of pah emission ,",
    "we follow the usual approach and measure the fluxes and equivalent widths ( ews ) of the 6.2 and 11.2@xmath0 m pah features from their mid - ir spectra .",
    "even though the 7.7@xmath0 m pah is the strongest of all pahs @xcite , we prefer not to include it in our analysis .",
    "this is due to the fact that its measurement is affected by absorption and emission features next to it and depends strongly both on the assumptions of the various measurement methods ( spline or drude profile fitting ) as well as the underlying continuum .",
    "furthermore , it often spans between the two sl orders , which could also affect its flux estimate .",
    "the 6.2 and 11.2@xmath0 m pah ews are derived by integrating the flux of the features above an adopted continuum and then divide by the continuum fluxes in the integration range . the baseline is determined by fitting a spline function to the selected points ( 5.95 - 6.55@xmath0 m for the 6.2@xmath0 m pah and 10.80 - 11.80@xmath0 m for the 11.2@xmath0 m pah ) .",
    "the pah ews as well as the integrated fluxes are listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the errors including both flux calibration and measurement are estimated to be less than @xmath1415% on average .",

    "the authors suggested that there was a statistical difference in the strength of the pah emission and the underlying hot continuum ( @xmath28 m ) emission between type 1 and type 2 objects .",
    "they also found that sy 2s had stronger pahs than sy 1s , while sy 1s had higher hot continuum associated with emission from the agn torus .",

    "the interpretation of these results was challenged by @xcite , who attributed it to the large ( 24@xmath29 ) aperture of iso / phot - s , and the possible contamination from the host galaxy .",
