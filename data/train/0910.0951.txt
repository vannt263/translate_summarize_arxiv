    "description of the spin dynamics of a two - dimensional electron gas is one of the most important problems for fundamental and applied modern spintronics.@xcite two mutually related problems in this field attract a great deal of attention : spin current and spin relaxation .",
    "spin currents describe how the spin density pattern changes with time mainly due to the spin transfer between different parts of the electron gas .",
    "since the spin dynamics of interest occurs usually in systems out of equilibrium , spin relaxation becomes important and contributes strongly into the evolution of spin density pattern .",
    "the key for understanding these properties is the spin - orbit coupling , making the orbital and spin degrees of freedom mutually dependent .",
    "spin - orbit coupling has many crucial influences on the properties of the systems where it occurs : the typical examples are nuclei , elementary particles , atoms , and electrons in solids .",
    "spin - orbit coupling , in general , makes the spin a non - conserved quantity , thus leading to a spin relaxation .",
    "it causes mutually dependent spin , charge , and mass flows in solids and quantum liquids.@xcite in addition , spin - orbit coupling leads to a spin response to an external electric field , providing an ability of spin manipulation by the electric field driving the dynamics in the orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite    the general techniques for calculation of spin relaxation and spin current out of equilibrium are the classical or quantum boltzmann - like equation for the spin - density matrix @xcite and nonequilibrium green functions.@xcite in this approach , the description of the electron dynamics takes into account possible relaxation processes due to the presence of spin - orbit coupling , disorder , phonons , and electron - electron collisions .",
    "the experimentally observable spin dynamics is due to the spin - orbit ( spin - momentum ) coupling . at the equilibrium",
    ", the expectation value of the spin current can be calculated directly .",
    "surprisingly , such a direct calculation demonstrated that the spin current can exist even in the equilibrium state of a two - dimensional electron gas with spin - orbit coupling.@xcite this observation brought a puzzle for the understanding of the basic phenomena in spin transport since the equilibrium spin current is not related to any spatial spin accumulation that can be seen experimentally .    on the other hand ,",
    "the spin dynamics due to the spin - orbit coupling can be understood in terms of a theory where the coupling is treated as a non - abelian gauge field , and the corresponding formalism can be applied @xcite . on a single - electron scale , for example",
    ", for electrons in quantum dots , the gauge transformation of the spin - orbit field was employed in refs.@xcite and used for the analysis of experimental results on spin manipulation by electric field in quantum dots in ref.@xcite .",
    "other interesting theoretical examples of applications of the non - abelian gauge field approach for single - electron spin transport and electrons in quantum dots , were found and studied ( for example , refs.@xcite-@xcite ) .    when applied to the two - dimensional electron gas ,",
    "the approach based on a formal @xmath0 gauge invariance of the spin - orbit hamiltonian ( i.  e. the symmetry with respect to local rotations in the spin subspace ) proved that the equilibrium spin current is the diamagnetic response to the effective non - abelian spin - orbit magnetic field.@xcite if the spin - orbit field is a pure gauge and , thus , can be removed by a gauge transformation , the effective @xmath0 magnetic field is zero , and the equilibrium spin current vanishes .    here",
    "we present a theory based on the gauge transformation , for spin dynamics in a two - dimensional electron gas in the case when the spin - orbit field can be completely removed by such a gauge transformation .",
    "we show that the absence of the equilibrium spin current is directly related to the giant anisotropy in the spin relaxation rate , when the relaxation does not occur for certain spin directions.@xcite after gauging away the spin - orbit coupling , the entire nonequilibrium dynamics of a _ transformed _ spin becomes almost trivial and can be described phenomenologically exactly by only two transport coefficients which can be determined experimentally , or calculated theretically to any desired level of accuracy .",
    "the first is the spin diffusion coefficient and the second is the electron mobility required only when a constant electric field is applied . with the inverse transformation to the initial dynamical variables ,",
    "we recover the full nontrivial dynamics of the _ physical _ spin , including the absence of the spin relaxation for certain spin directions , that is a strong anisotropy in the spin relaxation , stable spin configurations forming persistent spin helices , and spin precession due to a charge current in a constant external electric field . in addition",
    ", this approach allows making predictions for more general cases of spin - orbit coupling , including nonuniform spin - orbit fields .",
    "we begin with the conventional hamiltonian of spin - orbit coupling in two - dimensional electron gas : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the coordinate - dependent spin - orbit coupling field , @xmath4 is the momentum operator , cartesian subscript indices @xmath5 correspond to the electron coordinate @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pauli matrices with the upper cartesian indices corresponding to three directions @xmath8 in the spin subspace .",
    "we use the system of units with @xmath9 and sum up over repeating indices .",
    "interaction @xmath10 arises in a two - dimensional electron gas from various sources .",
    "two origins are considered as the most important .",
    "the first one , arising due to the inversion asymmetry of the crystal unit cell , is described by the dresselhaus model .",
    "the other one is the rashba field,@xcite where the coupling originates from the macroscopic asymmetry of the structure hosting the two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite due to various physical origins , including material , structure , doping , and possible mechanical strain , numerical values of parameters @xmath3 vary strongly from system to system ranging from @xmath11 ev@xmath12 cm for si- to @xmath13 ev@xmath12 cm for gaas - based structures and will not be discussed here .    for the coordinate - independent spin - orbit field @xmath14 , and the hamiltonian ( [ hso ] ) can be presented as :    @xmath15}\\cdot{\\bm \\sigma } \\right ) k_{j } , \\label{hso1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16}$ ] is a unit - length vector , and @xmath17 is the corresponding spin - orbit coupling constant for given component of momentum ; its contribution to the hamiltonian is , therefore , proportional to the spin projection onto the @xmath18}$ ] axis .",
    "the coupling leads to a momentum - dependent spin splitting of the electron states . as a results ,",
    "the fermi line of the electron gas becomes spin - dependent and two fermi lines in the electron gas appear .",
    "the @xmath10 hamiltonian makes the velocity spin - dependent : @xmath19   = \\frac{k_{j}}{m}+\\alpha _ { j}\\left ( \\mathbf{h}_{[j]}\\cdot{\\bm \\sigma } \\right ) , \\label{vj}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 being the electron effective mass .    with the spin - dependent velocity in eq.([vj ] ) we define the operator of the spin current in the form :    @xmath21    where the @xmath0 group generators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding spinors .",
    "for example , let @xmath24 be the ground state wave function .",
    "the resulting expectation value of the total spin current , summed up over all electrons in the gas is : @xmath25 in the absence of special symmetry relations between the components of the hamiltonian @xmath26 the expectation values of spin current @xmath27 are not zero , leading to the puzzling equilibrium spin current without any measurable spin transport .",
    "therefore , spin current can be a characteristic of the equilibrium states of two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "in the conventional calculation of @xmath28 due to the spin - doubling of the fermi line , contributions to @xmath29 come from two subsystems : single- and double occupied states at a given electron momentum .",
    "these two contributions have opposite signs and almost compensate each other , yielding the results in the third order of the coupling constants @xmath30 .",
    "this third - power dependence is expected from perturbation theory : @xmath29 should be an odd function of the spin - orbit coupling and vanish in the first order since in the ground state without spin - orbit coupling the fermi - line is not spin - split and all states with given @xmath31 are doubly occupied .    another important feature of the electron gas with spin - orbit coupling is the spin relaxation .",
    "assume that one has initially produced a nonequilibrium state @xmath32 of a uniform spin density with the components : @xmath33 then , the state @xmath34 will relax to the equilibrium through all possible interactions and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the first stage of the process , the momentum relaxation , is fast .",
    "if the spin - orbit coupling is weak compared to the random interactions causing the momentum relaxation , as it is assumed for the rest of this paper , the following spin relaxation is relatively slow . as a result ,",
    "at the second stage the spin components decrease with relaxation rates described by a symmetric tensor @xmath35 : @xmath36 the components of @xmath37 depend on the spin - orbit coupling and all possible interactions of electrons with disorder , phonons , and other electrons in the system.@xcite if the spin - orbit coupling vanishes , @xmath38 .",
    "now we write the hamiltonian of two - dimensional electron gas in the presence of spin - orbit coupling as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 contains all explicitly spin - independent terms , including electron - electron interactions and possibly , the effect of the external potential .",
    "the general non - abelian two - component potential is given by @xmath41 matrices : @xmath42}^{a}({\\bm\\rho})\\tau^{a}. \\label{aj}\\ ] ] the expression ( [ aj ] ) is valid for any arbitrary nonuniform spin - orbit coupling .",
    "let us now perform at a given @xmath43point a local @xmath44rotation @xcite in the spin subspace by @xmath45,\\ ] ] with the transformation of the field operators : @xmath46 this transformation renders the spin - independent quantities such as the charge density and the charge current density , invariant .",
    "in contrast , the spin density operators , @xmath47 transforming as @xmath48 exemplify covariant observable quantities .",
    "this difference between the physical quantities which transform invariantly and covariantly under a local @xmath0 rotation is crucial for the understanding of the spin dynamics .    for the matrix @xmath49,$ ] where @xmath50 is a unit length vector , the @xmath51matrices , transformed according to eq.([transform1 ] ) , acquire the form : @xmath52 + \\sin \\theta \\varepsilon^{abc}h^{a}\\tau^{c } , \\label{matr_transform}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the levi - civita tensor .",
    "this equation shows that the product @xmath54 is unaffected by the transformation ( [ u ] ) .",
    "therefore , if we present @xmath55 as the sum of longitudinal and transverse components @xmath56 with @xmath57 the longitudinal component ( spin projection onto the @xmath58axis ) remains constant , while the @xmath59 does not ; it rotates by the angle @xmath60 around the @xmath61axis ) .",
    "this simple observation will be important for the further analysis in this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian preserves its form under a local @xmath0 rotation of the fermionic fields if the vector - potential is transformed as follows @xmath62 indeed , after the transformation the hamiltonian acquires the form : @xmath63 which is identical to that of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , but with @xmath64 and @xmath65 being replaced by the transformed quantities , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "assume now that @xmath65 in the original hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) corresponds to a pure gauge vector - potential , that is both @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be removed by the above transformation such that @xmath70 .",
    "in this case there exists a local rotation determined by three coordinate - dependent functions @xmath71 : @xmath72,\\ ] ] such that the initial components @xmath65 can be presented in the form @xmath73 a vector - potential of this form is gauged away by the transformation ( [ u ] ) with @xmath74 : @xmath75 if the spin - orbit field can be removed by a gauge transformation , the subsequent spin dynamics is simplified considerably and in certain regimes , like the drift - diffusion processes considered below , the problem becomes elementary .",
    "the inverse @xmath44rotation transforms the spin components to the actual values and we recover the full dynamics of the physical spin .",
    "we will follow this procedure in the present paper .",
    "we mention a textbook example of a similar approach .",
    "when the motion of a relativistic electron in static perpendicular electric field @xmath76 and magnetic field @xmath77 is considered , there exists a reference frame , where , after the lorentz transformation , the smaller of these fields vanishes . in this frame",
    "the equations of the electron motion are very simple , and in the case @xmath78 they are essentially , one - dimensional .",
    "the inverse lorentz transformation provides the full description of the electron motion in the presence of both fields.@xcite    in the pure gauge field after the local @xmath0 transformation @xmath79 $ ] the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath80 with no spin - orbit coupling present . as mentioned above ,",
    "the spin dynamics with this hamiltonian can be formulated in general terms phenomenologically and then by inverse transformation , returned to the form where the coupling and full spin dynamics are restored .",
    "vector - potential is a pure gauge , allowing removal six terms in @xmath81 with the transformation @xmath82 based on the three functions @xmath83 given certain relations between the @xmath84 and @xmath69 components .",

    "experimentally , this fact corresponds to the vanishing relaxation for this spin direction ; this conclusion crucial for the design and application of spin - based devices .",
    "if @xmath105 the problem immediately becomes one - dimensional , trivial from the diamagnetic response interpretation of the equilibrium spin current , @xcite since one - dimensional systems do not demonstrate this kind of response .",
    "the same situation occurs in quantum wires , where the motion of electrons is strictly one - dimensional , no equilibrium spin current exists , and the spin projection along the @xmath97}$ ] axis is conserved . in the appendix , for illustration , we perform a conventional calculation of the equilibrium spin current in a two - dimensional electron gas with the pure gauge spin - orbit coupling and in a quantum wire , and demonstrate that the spin current vanishes in both systems .",

    "the meaning of the length @xmath138 can be understood as follows .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hso1 ] ) shows that the spin - orbit coupling @xmath10 causes for an electron moving with the velocity @xmath139 , spin precession around @xmath140 with the rate of the order of @xmath141 the corresponding precession angle is of the order of @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the electron displacement .",
    "thefore , @xmath138 can be viewed as the travel distance at which the electron spin can undergo a full rotation .",
    "another circumstance is , however , more important : the spin rotation angle depends only on the electron displacement and not on the details of its motion between initial and final points , leading to the appearance of stable spin structures , discussed below . here",
    "a numerical value of typical @xmath138 can be of interest .",
    "for gaas with @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the free electron mass , and @xmath146 of the order of @xmath147 mev@xmath148 cm , @xmath138 is of the order of several microns .    in both these systems ,",
    "the observed spin relaxation rate is strongly anisotropic with one spin component having lifetime orders of magnitude longer than the others .",
    "the weak relaxation rate for these components is determined by the mechanisms different from the homogeneous spin - orbit coupling , most probably , related to the disorder in the spin - orbit coupling . @xcite",
    "= 6.5 cm    after the gauge transformation , the spin - orbit interactions is switched off .",
    "therefore , on a time scale much longer than the momentum relaxation time , the spin dynamics becomes combination of pure spin diffusion and spin drift : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the spin - diffusion coefficient , @xmath151 is the electron mobility , and @xmath76 is the two - dimensional applied electric field @xcite as illustrated in fig.(3 ) . in eq.([tilde - diff ] ) we have taken into account that the uniform velocity of electrons is @xmath152 .",

    "the initial spin density eventually vanishes due to diffusion , however , the total integrated spin polarization will remain constant .",
    "the diffusive evolution of the transformed spin density @xmath155 occurs if the electron free path of the order of @xmath156 is much less than the spatial scale of the inhomogeneity : @xmath157 this condition can be formulated as @xmath158 meaning that the spin - orbit coupling is relatively weak .",

    "taking into account that electron momentum is @xmath190 one can see that @xmath191 corresponds to the dyakonov - perel relaxation with the relaxation rate on the order of @xmath192 .",

    "eqs.([dsdt2 ] ) and ( [ dsdt3 ] ) show that @xmath196 does not change with time , as expected , and the entire dynamics is solely due to the @xmath197component . as a simple illustration we consider the evolution of an initially homogeneous spin density . by solving equations ( [ diff])-([dsdt3 ] ) with the initial condition @xmath198 we find the spin dynamics @xmath199 + \\sin(\\omega_et ) ( { \\bf h}\\times{\\bf s}_0 ) \\right\\}e^{-\\gamma t},\\ ] ] where @xmath200 is the precession frequency in a drift - induced spin - orbit zeeman field , and @xmath201 is the diffusion related relaxation rate . from eq .",

    "the precession rate @xmath202 is of the order of @xmath207 , making the contributions of regular and random motion in the precession angle of the same order . if the spin diffusion is dominated by the impurity scattering , then @xmath150 and @xmath208 are proportional to the momentum relaxation time @xmath209 , and this electric field is disorder - independent .",
    "however , it can change with the temperature since in the non - degenerated gas @xmath150 approaches the electron diffusion coefficient @xcite and , therefore , by the einstein relation @xmath210 .",
    "another interesting effect of a spin - orbit coupling , which follows straightforwardly from our formulation  the existence of stable spatially inhomogeneous spin configuration .",
    "it is easy to verify that a general stationary ( @xmath211 ) solution to the equations ( [ diff])-([dsdt3 ] ) is of the form @xmath212- \\sin(2m\\alpha(\\bm{\\nu}\\cdot{\\bm\\rho}))({\\bf h}\\times{\\bf s}_0),\\ ] ] where @xmath213 is an arbitrary constant vector .",
    "this spatially inhomogeneous stationary solution to the drift - diffusion equation arises due to the symmetry of the system .",
    "as it was demonstrated for the particular case of the model with balanced rashba and dresselhaus couplings , the symmetry can protect electron spins from relaxation @xcite and allows for the persistent spin helix structures @xcite of the form of eq.([helix ] ) .",
    "the fact that the shape of this configuration does not depend on the diffusion coefficient @xmath150 shows that the persistent spin structure is insensitive to the spin - independent disorder , in agreement with ref.@xcite the analysis of the spin helix stability in the presence of disordered spin - orbit coupling can be found in ref.@xcite it is interesting to note that the helix structure is also insensitive to the presence of the electric field and , therefore , to the mobility and presence of a transport charge current , at least in the linear ohm s law regime .",
    "this seemingly counterintuitive result follows from the fact that the drift of the helix governed by the second term in ( [ dsdt1 ] ) is exactly compensated by the spin precession in the current - induced effective zeeman field , the second term in ( [ dsdt2 ] ) .",
    "a similar cancellation occurs in the diffusion channel .",
    "a diffusive spreadout of the helix , the first term in ( [ dsdt1 ] ) , and the relaxation of the transverse component of the spin , ( [ dsdt3 ] ) , are balanced by the ",
    "gradient - precession  contribution , the first term in ( [ dsdt2 ] ) .",
    "the persistent spin helix configuration ( [ helix ] ) has an extremely simple interpretation in terms of the transformed spin density @xmath214 .",
    "the general stationary solution of the standard drift - diffusion equation ( [ tilde - diff ] ) is simply a constant @xmath215 .",
    "the relation between the physical and transformed spin density components yield the conservation @xmath216 .",

    "the sum of the transformed terms is precisely the persistent spin helix of eq .",

    "it is also instructive to look at the precession and relaxation of a spatially homogeneous spin @xmath220 , eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) , from the point of view of the dynamics of the transformed spin density @xmath214 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath198 for the physical spin is mapped to the initial configuration for @xmath214 in a form of a spin helix that is similar to eq .",
    "( [ helix ] ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of @xmath214 is governed by the standard drift - diffusion equation ( [ tilde - diff ] ) .",
    "therefore the dynamical behavior is obvious -the initial helix for the transformed spin moves with the drift velocity @xmath221 , and washes out diffusively .",
    "when transformed to the physical spin , the drift of the helix translates to the precession , while its diffusive decay is mapped to the relaxation of the physical spin .",
    "this interpretation clearly explains why the relaxation time of the transverse components of the spin is universally determined by the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the relaxation of the physical spin components is gauge - equivalent to a purely diffusive process of washing out the initial helix configuration of the transformed spin .",
    "we developed a gauge theory of macroscopic spin dynamics in a two - dimensional electron gas when the spin - orbit coupling can be described as a pure gauge , and , therefore , removed by a local @xmath0 rotation in the spin subspace .",
    "we have shown that for a pure spin gauge , equilibrium spin current vanishes and a selected axis of conserved spin projection appears simultaneously , demonstrating gauge - related symmetry relation of these effects . after removing the spin - orbit coupling",
    ", we considered macroscopic phenomenological equations of spin dynamics , including spin diffusion and spin drift in an external electric field . by the inverse @xmath0 rotation we obtained the full system of partial differential equations for the time- and spatial measured spin density evolution .",
    "this system reproduces the physics of spin precession , stable spin configurations such as the persistent spin helix , and the resulting strongly anisotropic spin relaxation . since we described the system without spin - orbit coupling phenomenologically , our approach is valid at any temperature and electron concentration .",
    "it predicts that the ratio of the spin relaxation rate to the spin diffusion coefficient remains temperature- and electron concentration - independent if the coupling constants do not depend on these two system parameters .",
    "we presented explicit equations for the spatially uniform spin - orbit coupling and their solutions describing stable nonuniform structures , the precession and the relaxation of uniform spin polarization .",
    "these equations can be explicitly generalized for nonuniform two - dimensional electron gas in macroscopic systems .",
    "we mention two of them .",
    "the first one is the gaas quantum well grown along the @xmath222 $ ] direction with a modulated width @xmath223 , where the spin - orbit @xmath224 originated from the dresselhaus coupling , varies as @xmath225 .",
    "the corresponding spin - orbit field @xmath226 , @xmath227 , with @xmath228 remains a pure gauge .",
    "the other example is the balanced rashba - dresselhaus model with the coordinate - dependent rashba and dresselhaus parameters remaining exactly equal or exactly opposite everywhere . as in the @xmath222 $ ] structure , variation in the dresselhaus term",
    "is due to the controlled variation in the structure width , while the control of the rashba coupling is achieved by a coordinate - dependent bias across the well .",
    "a different kind of inhomogeneity occurs in mesoscopic systems where the effect of the boundary conditions for the coupled spin - charge dynamics becomes important.@xcite generalization of the gauge theory approach for the dynamics at the sample boundaries can be an interesting extension of our analysis for the infinite systems .",
    "spin dynamics in these systems is of interest for the fundamental understanding of spin transport and for applications in spintronics devices .",
