    "blazars as a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) exhibit a smooth , highly variable , highly polarized ir - uv continuum . according to `` unified schemes '' for radio - loud agn ( browne & murphy 1987 ; barthel 1989 ;",
    "antonucci 1993 ) the observed continuum comprises a mixture of thermal radiation and non - thermal beamed radiation .",
    "the thermal , unbeamed component extending from the uv to the soft x - rays may originate from a hot accretion disk , as in radio - quiet agn .",
    "the non - thermal component extending from the radio to the @xmath0-rays is thought to be relativistically beamed synchrotron radiation , possibly originating from a twin jet ( knigl 1981 ) .",
    "this beamed component is highly variable and highly polarized .",
    "blazars are thought to be those objects viewed at a small angle to the beaming axis and thus dominated by the non - thermal component ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "some blazars exhibit a broad emission line spectrum similar to seyfert galaxies and radio quiet quasars , particularly when the continuum is faint ( the exceptions are classified as bl lac objects ; see however scarpa & falomo 1997 ) .",
    "although blazars are highly variable and show broad emission lines , their line variability studies have received relatively little attention to date .    in recent years",
    "the study of broad - emission - line variability has been recognized as a powerful diagnostic of the broad line region in seyfert  1 galaxies ( peterson 1993 ) . in the best monitored agn ,",
    "high ionization lines like ly@xmath1 and c  iv are more rapidly variable ( factors of @xmath210 ) than low ionization lines like mg ii or h@xmath1 ( e.g. , clavel et al .",
    "1991 ; peterson 1993 ) .",
    "hence , the high ionization lines are extremely powerful probes of the smallest , most variable regions .",
    "yet ly@xmath1 emission line variability has been investigated in only a few high - luminosity radio - loud objects ( bregman et al .",
    "1986 ; prez et al . 1989",
    "; gondhalekar 1990 ; ulrich , courvoisier , & wamsteker 1993 ; webb et al .",
    "1994 ; scarpa , falomo , & pian 1995 , wamsteker 1997 ) .",
    "most of these studies indicate that emission line variability timescales are on the order of months and the variability is confined to the line cores .",
    "however , these objects are either not typical blazars ( i.e. , their continuum is not dominated by a beamed component ) or have only a handful of observations .",
    "it is not clear whether the broad emission lines in blazars behave differently from the broad emission lines observed in seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "further , what is the role of the blazar jet in photoionizing the emission lines ; that is , what is the effect of the beamed blazar light on the line emitting region ?",
    "what is the structure of the broad line region gas ?",
    "some investigations are starting to address these questions ( e.g. , corbett et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "3c  279 is an excellent target to study emission line variability in blazars , since it is a highly variable , bright radio source .",
    "it is also one of the brightest known extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources ( hartman et al .",
    "1992 ; von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ) , is highly variable at x - ray and @xmath0-ray energies ( makino et al .",
    "1989 ; kniffen et al . 1993 ; maraschi et al . 1994 ) , and is one of the clearest cases of relativistic beaming ( dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) .",
    "it shows highly variable optical polarization ( 945% ; angel & stockman 1980 ; impey & tapia 1990 ; mead et al . 1990 ) and has been one of the most intensively monitored objects of the blazar class . finally , it is one of two emission - line blazars with extensive archival uv spectra . in this paper",
    "we report the ly@xmath1 emission line history for 3c  279 , which has not been as thoroughly investigated as the continuum , and its relation to the continuum variability .",
    "the analysis is based on archival ultraviolet data from both the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "satellite ( _ iue _ ) and the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "between 1992 and 1996 , 3c 279 was observed three times with the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) .",
    "the 1992 observation covers the wavelength range 1150    4750  , and has been discussed in great detail by netzer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who note that the spectrum shows the ly@xmath1 , c  iv @xmath91549 , c  iii ] @xmath91909 , mg  ii @xmath92800 , and h@xmath10 lines .",
    "the ly@xmath1 , c  iii ] , and h@xmath10 line profiles are fairly symmetric , while c  iv and mg  ii have substantial red wings . during this period 3c  279",
    "was in a faint state , with a clearly visible ly@xmath1 emission line ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the 1994 and 1996 observations cover the wavelength range 1150    2312  .",
    "both these observations were obtained when 3c 279 showed a flare . once again , in these fos spectra the ly@xmath1 is still easily visible ( see figure  1 ) , but the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is not as good as in the 1992 observation .",
    "we retrieved the _",
    "data from the _ hst _ archive and recalibrated them using the best reference files , as recommended by the _ hst _ data handbook ( version 2 ) .",
    "the details of each observation are given in table  1 and the spectra are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the recalibration of the _ fos _ spectra was necessary because the older spectra are calibrated using different procedures and could not otherwise be directly compared to more recent spectra .",
    "the recalibrated _ fos _ spectra can also be directly compared with the _ iue _ spectra , since both the _ hst _ and _ iue _ spectro - photometric calibrations use the model white dwarf reference scale ( colina and bohlin 1994 ) . in fact , based on an analysis of seyfert galaxies observed simultaneously with _",
    "fos _ and _ iue _ , absolute flux differences are @xmath11% ( koratkar et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the 1994 fos observation was obtained using two gratings ( g130h and g190h ) . during the latter observation , due to reacquisition problems ,",
    "the target was partially out of the aperture and the g190h spectrum was affected .",
    "we have therefore added a constant flux to the g190h observation to align the data with the g130h spectrum .",
    "the errors given in table 1 for this spectrum ( y2ey0606 ) reflect our uncertainty ( 10% ) in applying this procedure .      between 1988 and 1996 , 3c 279 was observed with _",
    "many times with both the short - wavelength and long - wavelength cameras . the long wavelength ( lwp / lwr )",
    "spectra are affected by low detector sensitivity , and , increasingly with time , by scattered light , hence emission lines longward of the ly@xmath1 line are difficult to detect . in this paper , we concentrate on the ly@xmath1 line , and thus only the 15 short - wavelength ( swp ) camera observations are discussed further .    a careful inspection of the 15 line  by  line spectral images for flaws showed that in one case ( swp 40489 ) , the ly@xmath1 spectral region was contaminated by a cosmic ray .",
    "this spectrum was therefore rejected from further analysis .    all the line  by  line spectral images were also analyzed to determine the background contribution . a comparison of the average flux numbers ( fn ) in the 1866 - 1872  interval centered on the object spectrum and on the background ( 10 lines away on either side of the object spectrum ) showed that in swp 46662 and swp 53261 the background contribution exceeded 90% of the signal+background emission . therefore the ly@xmath1 emission line flux measurements for these spectra in table 1 are 5@xmath12 upper limits .",
    "these noisy spectra have not been used in the co - addition described below .",
    "all the spectra were extracted from the line  by  line image files using the newsips technique being implemented in the final _ iue _ archive .",
    "a summary of the newsips extraction technique can be found in nichols & linsky ( 1996 ) .",
    "the details of each observation are given in table  1 .",
    "all the 1992 - 1993 spectra are under exposed , but some signal is present .",
    "_ iue _ spectral regions with known artifacts , at 1278 - 1279  , 1450 - 1550  , and 1663   ( crenshaw , norman , & bruegman 1990 ) , were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the improved s / n obtained through newsips allowed sufficient contrast in the swp spectra between the continuum and ly@xmath1 , even in the lowest states , to perform for the first time a systematic study of the emission line in this source .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission feature that is clearly present in the _ fos _ data is also seen in all but four individual swp spectra ( see table  1 ) .",
    "recently , the sensitivity degradation correction for swp spectra obtained after 1993 has been determined .",
    "this correction is time dependent , and can be up to 5% in 1996 ( imhoff 1997 ) .",
    "this correction has not yet been implemented in the final _ iue _ archive , however , so we have conservatively added a 5% error in quadrature to the uncertainties of the continuum and line fluxes for spectra obtained after 1993 .    to improve the s / n ratio of the ly@xmath1 emission line",
    ", we binned the spectra in four groups depending on the continuum flux at 1750  .",
    "the swp spectra in each group were then co - added , as follows : the ` high spectrum ' was generated by co - adding all spectra with @xmath13 @xmath14 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xmath6 , the ` medium spectrum ' is a co - addition of all spectra with @xmath15 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xmath6 , the ` low spectrum ' is a co - addition of all spectra with @xmath16 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xmath6 , and the ` very low spectrum ' includes all spectra with @xmath17 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xmath6 . in figure",
    "2 we show the four co - added spectra . the ly@xmath1 emission line is easily seen at @xmath2 1868  .",
    "the redshift measured from the _ iue _ observations is in good agreement with the redshift determined from the high s / n ratio _ fos _ data ( netzer et al . 1994 ) given the wavelength uncertainty and the low s / n ratio of the _ iue _ spectra .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density in the direction of 3c 279 is 2.22@xmath1810@xmath19@xmath5 ( elvis , lockman , & wilkes 1989 ) which implies a@xmath20 = 0.13 for a total - to - selective extinction ratio r = 3.1 .",
    "all the _ fos _ and _ iue _ spectra were dereddened assuming the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction curve .",
    "a simple power - law model was fitted to the dereddened spectra in the wavelength region 1230  1950   using the iraf / stsdas tool _",
    "nfit1d_. wavelength regions affected by the _ iue _ artifacts were excluded from the fits to the _ iue _ spectra , as was the region around ly@xmath1 .",
    "we defined 1750   as the fiducial wavelength for continuum flux measurements because this region of the swp spectrum is relatively free of _ iue _ artifacts and line emission .",
    "after subtracting the best - fit power - law continuum , the ly@xmath1 line was measured as follows .",
    "the 1992 _ fos _ observation , which has the best s / n and spectral resolution , was accurately modeled with a multicomponent gaussian fit using a minimalist approach ( least number of free parameters ) . iraf / stsdas tool _",
    "ngaussfit _ was used for this procedure .",
    "this model of the ly@xmath1 line was then used to fit the remaining two _ fos _ spectra .",
    "since these spectra have lower s / n , the observed wavelength of the ly@xmath1 line was fixed at 1868  ( within the wavelength calibration error of the _ fos _ ) and the widths and amplitudes were allowed to vary .",
    "we note here that all the _ fos _ spectra show an intrinsic absorption feature in the ly@xmath1 emission line .",
    "these absorption features are discussed in detail by chaffee et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "due to the low s / n ratio of the _ iue _ data , the observed wavelength of the ly@xmath1 line was fixed at 1868    ( within the wavelength calibration error of the _ iue _ ) , and the line was modeled with a single gaussian whose width and height were allowed to vary freely .",
    "a single gaussian fit was sufficient for the _ iue _ because of the low spectral resolution . in all but two spectra",
    ", the ly@xmath1 emission line is easily detected ; in the exceptions ( swp35443 , swp36420 ) the ly@xmath1 region is very noisy .",
    "the continuum fluxes at 1750  and the ly@xmath1 line fluxes , along with their associated uncertainties , are reported in table  1 for the individual spectra and in table  2 for the co - added spectra .",
    "although the data are sparse and unevenly sampled , the continuum flux density and the line flux over the 8-year observation period show very different characteristics ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the continuum flux has varied by a factor of @xmath250 , while the ly@xmath1 line flux has remained nearly constant .",
    "we used two independent methods to test whether the emission line flux is constant . in the first method , a reduced chi - square test on the emission line flux",
    "gives a @xmath21 = 1.3 for 12 degrees of freedom indicating that the emission line flux data are consistent with being constant . in the second method , in our line fitting procedure ( discussed in section 2 ) we kept all parameters of the gaussian model constant and determined the reduced chi - square of the fit for each spectrum .",
    "the constant model used the parameters derived from the 1992 _ fos _ spectrum , which has the best s / n and spectral resolution .",
    "the reduced chi - square of the constant model and the free gaussian model were checked using an f - test .",
    "this test showed that the constant model and the free gaussian model were comparable at the 95% level ( f=1.1 for a change of 2 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we conclude that in 3c  279 , although the observed continuum flux density has varied , the ly@xmath1 flux has remained essentially constant .",
    "this trend between the continuum and line is similar to the case of 3c  273 , where the ly@xmath1 varied little or not at all during a factor of three change in the uv continuum ( ulrich et al .",
    "such a trend between the emission line fluxes and the continuum was first noted by sandage , westphal and strittmatter ( 1966 ) .",
    "the continuum and line variation in 3c  279 is in sharp contrast to that seen in seyfert galaxies , where the continuum and line vary with similar amplitudes and in a correlated way ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 , clavel 1991 , peterson 1993 , reichert 1994 , crenshaw 1996 and wanders 1997 ) .",
    "this lack of ly@xmath1 variation is not just an effect of temporal sampling of the variability . in order to determine the effect of temporal sampling on the line variability , we compared our results to those of the much better - understood case of the seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 which shows a clear correlation ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) between ly@xmath1 and the uv continuum ( clavel et al .",
    "1991 ; korista et al .",
    "1995 ) , with a lag of @xmath210 days . in 1989 , ngc  5548 was observed every four days for eight months ( clavel et al .",
    "we selected 16 points at random from the 1989 ngc  5548 continuum and ly@xmath1 light curves .",
    "for these 16 points we determined the amount of variation in both the continuum and lines flux .",
    "the process was repeated a 100 times .",
    "there was not a single 16 point sampling where the line flux was constant while the continuum flux varied as seen in 3c  279 .",
    "this difference in the ly@xmath1 variability of blazars can be explained if the thermal continuum that primarily photoionizes the line emitting gas is hidden by the variability of the beamed continuum in radio - loud agn .",
    "this effect would be strongest in blazars , where the beamed component contribution dominates the observed continuum .    the ly@xmath1 equivalent width ( @xmath24 ) of 3c  279 ranges between 1 and 45 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath24 are smaller than those observed in normal quasars ( kinney , rivolo & koratkar 1990 ; cristiani & vio 1990 ; cheng & fang 1987 ) , where the thermal component , possibly the accretion disk , is the only source of ionizing radiation and observed continuum and gives rise to the observed @xmath25100 . in blazars",
    "there are two sources of ionizing radiation : ( 1 ) the beamed non - thermal radiation from the relativistic jet , and ( 2 ) the thermal component probably from an accretion disk . thus , the observed continuum has contributions both from the disk and jet .",
    "if we assume that the beam is not contributing to ionizing the line emitting gas , and only the thermal component is responsible for line emission , then the contribution of the beamed component to the observed continuum determines the strength of the equivalent width .",
    "the expected @xmath24 in blazars should be smaller than observed in normal quasars and should be anti - correlated with the contribution of the beamed component to the observed continuum ( see corbett 1996 ) . in 3c  279",
    "we see this characteristic equivalent width trend ( see figure 5 ) . at low observed continuum levels , the @xmath24 becomes comparable ( @xmath2100 ) to other quasars when the beamed continuum contribution is @xmath22@xmath18 the accretion disk contribution , and at high observed continuum levels the beamed continuum contribution is @xmath230@xmath18 the accretion disk contribution .",
    "this model suggests that at low continuum levels we should see a change in uv continuum slope because of the increased contribution of the big blue bump due to the accretion disk . at high continuum levels we should just see the synchrotron power law slope",
    "such a change in the uv slope of 3c  279 has been noted by pian ( 1997 ) .",
    "one of the models for the production of @xmath0-ray emission in blazars is compton upscattering of ambient ly@xmath1 line photons ( sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) .",
    "variability of @xmath0-rays could therefore be caused by changes in the ly@xmath1 intensity or in the energetic electrons of the jet .",
    "the @xmath0-rays would vary linearly with ly@xmath1 flux and/or quadratically with respect to synchrotron emission depending on the direction of the jet electrons .",
    "if some of the ly@xmath1 flux increases in response to the beamed continuum ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) , then the @xmath0-ray flux could increase even more than the square of the observed uv synchrotron flux . a strong correlation between uv and @xmath0-ray flux has been observed in 3c  279 ( maraschi 1994 , wehrle 1997 ) , indicating that the beamed continuum could be ionizing some of the line emitting gas .",
    "our present analysis suggests that @xmath0-ray variability must be caused by variations in the jet rather than the external ly@xmath1 photons .",
    "the present data do not allow us to determine the contribution of jet synchrotron emission to photoionizing some of the ly@xmath1 emission clouds .",
    "if the beamed continuum does ionize some of the line emitting gas , we should see rapid variations in the emission line profile .",
    "the nature of the variations would depend on the kinematic structure of the line emitting gas .",
    "our _ iue _ data do not have high enough spectral resolution or s / n to allow us to decompose the line core and wings but the ly@xmath1 line profile appears symmetric , as it does in the _ fos _ 1992 spectrum ( netzer et al .",
    "the 1994 and 1996 _ fos _ spectra show intrinsic absorption and do not have sufficient s / n to determine accurately the line profile variations .",
    "simultaneous monitoring of 3c  279 in both the uv and @xmath0-ray would allow us to study continuum and emission line profile variability , and then unambiguously select the correct inverse compton model for @xmath0-ray production .",
    "our analysis of the archival _ iue _ and _ hst / fos _ observations of 3c  279 over a period of eight years shows that although the continuum has varied by large amplitude , the ly@xmath1 flux has remained essentially constant .",
    "this suggests that the beamed continuum is not the dominant source of photoionization of the broad line clouds , which are instead likely to be powered by a thermal component underlying the beamed continuum",
    ".    the strong @xmath0-ray emission from 3c  279 may be due to compton scattering of the ly@xmath1 line photons . in this case",
    ", the large amplitude of the @xmath0-ray variability must be due to changes in the energy distribution of electrons in the jet , rather than changes in the external photon field .",
    "this implies that @xmath0-rays will change as the square of the synchrotron flux , or perhaps even more if the beamed continuum ionizes line - emitting gas lying close to the jet axis ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .",
    "high quality line profile observations are necessary to test this model further .    j.e.p .",

    "<S> the behavior of the ly@xmath1 emission line flux and continuum flux is similar to that of the only other well observed blazar , 3c  273 , which shows constant line flux while the continuum varies by a factor of @xmath23 . </S>",
