    "interference is often considered as a signature of superposition in quantum systems . in particular ,",
    "interference in many - body systems as a macroscopic quantum effect has been attracting many interests . in usual experiments ,",
    "two fields originating in a common source are subject to interfere , namely , each particle interferes with itself @xcite . on the other hand , in many - boson systems including lasers @xcite and atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , interference has been observed even between independently prepared particles , especially as spatial fringes in a single shot indicating the second - order coherence . such interference is often explained in terms of the spontaneous symmetry breaking for the relative phase between the independent sources , which presumes nonvanishing expectation values of the field operators or classical mean fields with definite phases .",
    "however , the symmetry breaking seems problematic in the absence of real mechanism . in becs , a u(1 )",
    "symmetry is relevant for the global phase rotation of atomic wavefunctions , the breakdown of which relies on a nonphysical interaction @xcite . in optical systems , a u(1 )",
    "symmetry is also imposed from lack of an absolute phase reference , which describes the effective photon - number conservation in optical processes @xcite .    the interference pattern observed in a single shot of measurement for independent sources under the u(1 ) symmetry has been attributed to the back - action of particle detection on the systems , which causes localization of the relative phase @xcite .",
    "another approach to the interference is to calculate the correlation functions of the particle numbers measured by the different detectors , which show the spatial modulation . by evaluating the statistical moments of the fourier components of the spatial modulation up to the fourth order ,",
    "the plane - wave interference of atomic becs is predicted in a single run with a random phase @xcite .",
    "this analysis exploits the nature of the plane - wave mode functions .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the interference of optical fields comprehensively under various configurations for sources and detectors , which is based on the probability theory of quantum measurement .",
    "specifically , we examine the probability distribution of the photon numbers which are registered by the detectors , rather than evaluating the correlation functions of the field intensities as the averages over many runs of measurement .",
    "this approach is hence of direct relevance to see the interference pattern in each single shot .",
    "especially , for interference of two independent mixtures of number states , despite lack of intrinsic phases due to the u(1 ) symmetry , the joint probability in the multi - dimensional space of the photon counts at the detectors may have a distinct manifold of sharp peaks along the trajectory of the mean - field values as the relative phase varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "then , the photon - number outcomes in each shot of measurement should mostly be realized as a point in the peak manifold with a randomly chosen relative phase , exhibiting an interference pattern .",
    "hence , the probability distribution of photon detection provides a quantitative criterion to inspect whether an interference pattern appears or not as described with the classical mean fields .",
    "we examine the single - shot interference patterns for u(1)-invariant source fields with a variety of photon - number statistics .",
    "it will turn out that the mean - field description is applicable to independent fields with poissonian or sub - poissonian statistics , whereas for super - poissonian statistics it is likely invalidated with rather broad probability distributions .",
