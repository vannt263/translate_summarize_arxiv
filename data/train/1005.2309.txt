    "the total and elastic cross sections are basic objects of the scattering theory .",

    "it was suggested recently @xcite how to extract the total @xmath1 cross section in the high - energy region .",

    "the main effort concentrated on the design and construction of forward proton detectors @xcite .",
    "also zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc s ) have been considered as a useful supplement .",
    "it will measure very forward neutrons and photons in the pseudorapidity region @xmath4 at the cms @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the atlas zdc s provide coverage of the region @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently that the cms ( compact muon spectrometer ) collaboration zdc s provide a unique possibility to measure the @xmath1 total cross section @xcite .    even at high - energy the major part of the phase space of a few - body reactions",
    "is populated in soft processes which can not be calculated within perturbative qcd",
    ". only limited corner of the phase space , where particles are produced at large transverse momenta , can be addressed in the framework of pqcd . at high energy",
    "the regge approach is the most efficient tool to describe total cross section , elastic scattering as well as different 2 @xmath6 2 reactions @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall show how to construct the amplitude for the considered 2 @xmath6 4 process in terms of several 2 @xmath6 2 soft amplitudes known from the literature . in the present analysis",
    "we will also include absorption effects as was done recently for three - body processes @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we consider an example of an exclusive reaction with two forward neutrons . given the experimental infrastructure the @xmath0 is one of the reactions with four particles in the final state which could be addressed at lhc .",
    "the diffractive mechanisms involving pomeron and reggeon exchanges included in the present paper are shown in fig.[fig : diagrams ] ( with the four - momenta @xmath8 ) . in principle in all diagrams shown the intermediate nucleon can be replaced by nucleon excited states .",
    "it is known that diffractive excitation of nucleons to inelastic states is rather large and constitutes about 1/3 of the elastic scattering .",
    "this number is , however , not relevant in our case , as it is to large extend due to the deck type mechanism @xcite which is included explicitly in our calculation . the remaining excitation to discrete nucleon states is rather small and difficult to calculate .",
    "a microscopic calculation must unavoidably include not only the structure of the nucleon but also of the nucleon excited states .",
    "the cross section for @xmath9 of our interest is , however , only a fraction of mb @xcite . that the contribution of excited discrete state is small can be also seen in the following way .",
    "first of all the diffractive transitions to discrete excited states are known to be much weaker than the elastic one .",
    "secondly the @xmath10 coupling constants are much smaller than the @xmath11 coupling constant @xcite .",

    "the full amplitude was parametrized in terms of leading pomeron and subleading reggeon trajectories .",
    "we have consider 3 classes of diagrams .",
    "the first class gives the largest contribution but concentrated at forward or backward pion directions .",
    "there are also diagrams with double charged exchanges with subleading reggeons @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "although the cross section for these contributions is rather small , it is concentrated at midrapidities of pions where the cross section can be easily measured .",
    "the double - exchange reggeons processes can be separated out in the two - dimensional space of rapidities of both pions or in the distribution of the pion rapidity difference .",
    "large cross sections have been obtained , even bigger than for the @xmath20 reaction @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms contribute to the cross section , which leads to an enhancement of the cross section due to interference effects .",
    "these interference effects cause that the extraction of the elastic @xmath12 cross section as proposed recently @xcite seems in practice rather impossible .",
    "the specifity of the reaction is that both neutrons and pions are emitted in very forward / backward directions , producing a huge rapidity gap at midrapidities .",
    "while the neutrons could be measured by the zdc s , the identification of pions may be difficult .",
    "we think that the measurement of both neutrons and observation of large rapidity gap is a very good signature of the considered reaction .",
    "we expect the cross section for the @xmath88 , @xmath89 , etc .",
    ", which could destroy rapidity gaps , to be smaller but a relevant estimates need to be done . in addition for events with larger number of pions the rapidity gap would be destroyed . therefore the formally kinematically incomplete measurement of two neutrons only could be relatively precise .",
    "we have found that the neutrons measured in zdc s seem to be almost uncorrelated in energies .",
    "we have made predictions for azimuthal angle correlations of outgoing neutrons .",
    "such distribution should be possible to measure in a future . at present at cms",
    "only horizontal position can be measured .",
    "we have predicted back - to - back correlations with a sizeable diffusion .",
    "we have included elastic rescattering effects in a way used recently for the three body processes .",
    "these effects lead to a substantial damping of the cross section .",
    "the bigger energy the larger the effect of damping . other processes ( e.g. inelastic intermediate states or final state @xmath90 interactions ) could lead to additional damping . at present",
    "there is no full understanding of the absorption effects .",
    "a future experiment could provide new data to be analyzed and could shed new light on absorption effects which are essential for understanding exclusive processes , even such important ones as exclusive production of the higgs boson .    in the light of our analysis",
    "it becomes clear that extraction of the elastic @xmath91 cross section seems impossible , due to interference of several processes discussed in our paper .",
    "we did not find any corner of the phase space where the relevant diagram dominates .",
    "there is an attempt to install forward shower counters in the lhc tunnel .",
    "most probably they will not be able to measure energy of the pions but they can signal some activity there .",
