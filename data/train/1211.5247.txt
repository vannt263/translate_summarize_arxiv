    "our program of ground - based observations of stars selected for kepler asteroseismic targets has been started in 2005 and is continued since then .",
    "we collect high - resolution echelle spectra at the catania astrophysical observatory ( italy , 91-cm telescope , observer : jm ) , the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( usa , two 1.5-m telescopes and the 6-m mmt telescope , observer : dwl ) , the nordic optical telescope ( spain , 2.5-m telescope , observer : ta ) , the ondrejov observatory ( czech republic , 2-m telescope , observers : en and jk ) , and the pozna university observatory in borowiec ( poland , a single telescope with two 0.5-m mirrors , observer : wd ) . the multicolor ccd and photoelectric data are collected at the wrocaw university observatory in biakw ( poland , 0.6-m telescope , observers : gk , an , ms and jm ) and the catania astrophysical observatory ( italy , 91-cm telescope , observer : jm ) .",
    "we aim at the determination of atmospheric parameters of the program stars , i.e. , the effective temperature , @xmath2 , surface gravity , @xmath3 , and metallicity , @xmath4 $ ] , as well as the projected rotational velocity , @xmath5 , and radial velocity , @xmath6 .",
    "we use this last parameter to discover and study spectroscopic binaries in the kepler field of view .",
    "a search for new variable stars in the kepler field of view is our separate study .",
    "we measured @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for 62 kepler asteroseismic targets and 33 other stars in the satellite s field of view ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "most of our program stars are stars of spectral type f , g or k and the luminosity classes v , iv or iii .",
    "however , our sample includes also around 20 a - type stars , a handful of b - type stars , and one o - type star , hip92637 , as well as three subdwarfs , hip92775 , hip94704 and hip99267 , and one supergiant , hip97439 .",
    "we find that all but one of the stars selected for kepler asteroseismic targets have solar metallicity or are slightly metal - deficient .",
    "the only exception is hip92775 , sdf8 ( see @xcite ) ; the other two subdwarfs are not kepler program stars .",
    "the projected velocity of rotation of the f , g and k stars observed by us is low , typically below 5 km / s ( see @xcite and @xcite ) ; @xmath5 of the early - type stars observed by us is significantly higher .",
    "we note , however , that several of our early - type program stars , namely , hip93522 , a7 , hip93941 , b2 , and hip96762 , b9 , have @xmath5 below 10 km / s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this makes them very important and rare targets for an asteroseismic study of early - type stars because for stars rotating so slowly it is possible to perform an unambiguous identification of the modes of pulsation ; for stars rotating with @xmath8 km / s the asteroseismic analysis becomes difficult and may be inconclusive .      in @xcite",
    "we report a discovery of two double - lined spectroscopic binaries , sb2 , hip96299 and hip98551 .",
    "the former of these stars , hip96299 , has been discovered to be an eclipsing binary with a period of 10.0486 days by @xcite ; the latter , hip98551 , is not known to show eclipses . since for sb2 eclipsing binaries it is possible to derive precise masses of the components , which then enter evolutionary and asteroseismic models as one of the fundamental parameters , both stars need further study in order to obtain their radial - velocity curves and find the orbital solutions . for hip98551 , time - series photometry",
    "would be needed to find out whether the system is eclipsing .",
    "we have also discovered six single - lined spectroscopic binaries , sb1 , namely , hip94734 and hip94743 discovered by @xcite , hip92132 and hip97513 discovered by @xcite , and hip96277 and hip97582 discovered by @xcite . since for sb1 stars it is possible to calculate the systems mass function ,",
    "this parameter can be used for estimating the magnitude and color indices of the secondary component of the system , and calculating the duplicity corrections .",
    "neglecting this corrections may lead to incorrect determination of luminosity and effective temperature , and eventually to a wrong asteroseismic model .",
    "_ vs. _ @xmath9 relation of stars in the kepler field of view ( a figure originally published in @xcite ) .",
    "the distances , @xmath10 [ pc ] , used in coding the symbols were obtained from the revised hipparcos parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents the standard relation valid for unreddened f0g2 stars of luminosity classes iii ",
    "v , the long - dashed line , the standard relation for a7f0 stars adopted from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the short - dashed lines show by how much an unreddened f - type star may deviate from the standard relation because of `` cosmic scatter '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the arrow is the reddening vector @xmath11 mag . ]",
    "_ vs. _ spectral type diagram of the program stars ( a figure originally published in @xcite ) .",
    "the solid line represents the intrinsic relation for luminosity class v , and the dashed line , for luminosity class iii @xcite .",
    "the distances , @xmath10 [ pc ] , used in coding the symbols , were obtained from the revised hipparcos parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the two subdwarfs from our sample and two leftmost luminosity iii stars are joined with dotted lines .",
    "the arrow is the reddening vector @xmath12 mag . ]      in @xcite , we report deriving the interstellar reddening for 29 stars in the kepler field of view . having plotted the program stars in several photometric diagrams we conclude that these stars are not reddened .",
    "they do not deviate either from the standard relation between @xmath13 and @xmath9 given by @xcite and @xcite for a7g2 iii  v stars ( see fig .",
    "1 ) or from the intrinsic relation between @xmath14 and spectral type given by @xcite for stars of the luminosity class v and iii ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this result is in a disagreement with the information that can be found in the kepler kic-10 catalogue which gives @xmath15 ranging from 0.01 to 0.06 mag for nine of our program stars .",
    "derived with the use of the elodie archive , which is an on - line database of high - resolution stellar spectra ( see http://atlas.obs-hp.fr/elodie ) , plotted as a function of @xmath2 derived from the @xmath16 index for population i stars ( points ) , and @xmath2 derived from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 indices for the subdwarfs ( encircled points ) .",
    "the solid line has unit slope and zero intercept ; the short - dashed line runs 311k below it .",
    "( the figure has been originally published in @xcite . ) ]    another result of our photometric study of kepler asteroseismic targets is finding a discrepancy between effective temperatures derived for stars hotter than 6000k by means of spectroscopic and photometric methods ( see fig .",
    "the spectroscopic temperatures of these stars are around 300k lower than @xmath2 derived from photometric indices .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear and will be studied by us in more detail in near future .",
    "the open cluster ngc6866 is one of four open cluster in kepler field of view .",
    "it has been selected for a target in an asteroseismic campaign in summer 2009 in the frame of the activities of the kepler asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc ) working group#2 .    between april 27 and july 21 2007",
    ", we carried out photometric ccd observations of this cluster with the aim of a search for variable stars .",
    "we used the @xmath18 filters of the johnson - kron - cousins @xmath19 photometric system and collected around 470 ccd frames in each filter during 14 nights .",
    "we discovered 19 variable stars of different types ( see @xcite ) .",
    "three of them we classified as @xmath0 sct , two , as @xmath1 dor , four , as wuma , two , as ellipsoidal variables , one , as an eclipsing binary and seven , as irregular variables .",
    "all five pulsating variables are very probable members of the cluster .",
    "this makes them promising asteroseismic targets because for stars belonging to a cluster it is reasonable to assume the same age and metallicity , leaving the radii and masses as the only free parameters in asteroseismic modeling .",
    "the eclipsing binary is definitely not a cluster member .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to use this star to measure the age and distance to ngc6866 with the method used by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "having discovered @xmath1 dor stars in ngc6866 , in @xcite we discuss the properties of open clusters in which pulsators of this type occur .",
    "we show that there is no relation between the age or metallicity of the cluster and the number of @xmath1 dor stars ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "in this way we show that the persisting belief that @xmath1 dor stars occur only in open clusters which are young is unfounded .",
    "dor stars in open clusters coded with shades of gray .",
    "the vertical line at 250 myr indicates a suspected upper limit of the age of an open cluster that can host @xmath1 dor stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( the figure has been originally published in @xcite . ) ]",
    "deriving parameters of kepler targets by means of spectroscopic and photometric ground - based observations is our primary goal .",
    "this task is being realized at the observatories already mentioned , as well as at the telescopio nazionale galileo , tng , ( la palma , spain ) where 19 targets from the kasc proposal no .",
    "30 ( see http://astro.phys.au.dk/kasc ) have been scheduled for the aot20/09b service observations ( proposal tac_71 , `` spectral characterization of kepler asteroseismic targets '' , p.i . :",
    "g.  catanzaro ) .    in our study we will focus on a detailed analysis of the stars metallicity , the parameter which is crucial for asteroseismic analysis of kepler data",
    "this has been demonstrated by @xcite who showed that the uncertainty in metallicity dominates the uncertainty in the stellar radius .",
    "we plan also a detailed study of selected program stars with the aim of solving the discrepancy between the effective temperatures of hot kepler targets determined from spectroscopy and from photometry .",
    "binary stars require a large amount of observing time .",
    "first , they need to be confirmed as binaries , then , the orbital period must be determined . depending on the particular target , the availability of observing time and the weather conditions",
    ", such a task can take several days , weeks or months .",
    "therefore , we selected a handful of most promising targets which are scheduled for observing at several observatories .",
    "we plan to merge all the data we collect and confirm ( or reject ) the suspected spectroscopic binarity of these stars , and compute orbital elements for the confirmed ones .",
    "we plan to compute evolutionary and asteroseismic models for selected kepler asteroseismic targets using the astec and adipls codes ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . as the input of the modeling procedure",
    ", we will use the atmospheric parameters derived by us in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when possible , we will put additional constraints on the models , e.g. , by limiting the possible range of masses of eclipsing sb2 stars using the results from their orbital solution .",
    "the echelle spectroscopic observations collected by us at the catania astrophysical observatory are available as the helas deliverables at the wrocaw helas webpage at http://helas.astro.uni.wroc.pl/deliverables.php ."
