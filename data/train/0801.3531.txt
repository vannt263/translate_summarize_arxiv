    "since the early days of quantum electronics , non - linear optics has played a basic role both for its relevance as a fundamental chapter of modern science and for its technological applications @xcite .",
    "nonlinear parametric processes , due to the peculiar correlation properties of the generated photons , have been adopted to investigate the quantum properties of electromagnetic fields . in the last few years",
    "it has been proposed to exploit entangled quantum states in order to increase the resolution in quantum interferometry , specifically , for quantum lithography @xcite and to achieve heisenberg limited resolution @xcite . in such framework , particular attention has been devoted to the generation of noon states , path entangled states of the form @xmath0 , of fundamental relevance since a single - photon phase shift @xmath1 induces a relative shift between the two components equal to @xmath2 .",
    "this feature can be exploited to enhance phase resolution in interferometric measurements , leading to a sub - rayleigh resolution scaling as @xmath3 ; @xmath4 being the wavelength of the field @xcite .",
    "the generation of photonic noon states has been the subject of intense theoretical research @xcite , but up to now the actual experimental implementation has been limited to a posteriori generation of two , three and four photons states @xcite and to the conditional generation of a noon state with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the weak value of the generated number of photons strongly limits the potential applications to quantum lithography and quantum metrology . as alternative approach to emulate the quantum resolution ,",
    "it has been proposed to adopt classical , coherent light @xcite effectively exploiting the non - linearity of the absorbing material .",
    "first experimental results have been recently reported : yablonovitch et al .",
    "proposed to use an interference technique with multiple - frequency beams achieving an experimental visibility of @xmath6 @xcite while boyd et al .",
    "achieved a two - fold enhancement of the resolution over the standard rayleigh limit adopting a uv lithographic material excited by multi - photon aborption @xcite .",
    "recently it has been proposed to exploit a high gain optical parametric amplifier acting on the vacuum field to generate fields with a high number of photons still exhibiting sub - rayleigh periods : fig.1-a @xcite .",
    "the quantum lithography architecture involves the generation of correlated beams over the modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the mixing over a beamsplitter ( bs ) , the phase shifting of one mode and then the recombination of the two modes over a second .",
    "finally the output state is detected via a two - photon absorption over the outgoing modes . in the typical low - gain regime",
    "the quantum state @xmath9 is generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) and a hong - ou - mandel interferometer adopting a post - selection technique @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has recently been theoretically shown that , for any gain of the parametric amplifier , the two - photon excitation rate presents a fringe pattern of the form @xmath10 which never falls below a visibility of @xmath11 .",
    "such an approach could lead to high resolution with a high number of photons overcoming the difficulty connected with the adoption of noon state with a low number of photons . at variance with the scheme based on classical radiation , the one here demonstrated exploits quantum features of the opa field .",
    "in the present paper we experimentally investigate the properties of the optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) operating in the high gain regime . instead of dealing with path entangled states",
    ", we consider the generation of entangled states over the same mode but with orthogonal polarizations , respectively , horizontal ( @xmath12 ) and vertical ( @xmath13 ) . the scheme is shown in fig.1-b .",
    "the non - linear crystal ( bbo ) is pumped by a high - power laser . the first order contribution to the output field",
    "is the twin photons state over the same mode : @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "such polarization - entangled photons can be easily converted to path entangled via an additional polarizing .",

    "the average photon number created per polarization mode is equal to @xmath35 . in the interferometric setup",
    "the output state is shifted by a phase @xmath1 in the basis @xmath36 .",
    "hence the output state is detected in the basis @xmath37 adopting a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .  for different values of the phase @xmath1 ,",
    "the quantum state @xmath38 is analyzed through two different second - order correlation functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the output modes of the pbs . by tuning @xmath1 it is found @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
