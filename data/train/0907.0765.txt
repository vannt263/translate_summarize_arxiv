    "modifications of general relativity ( gr ) on the largest scales have been advocated in order to give account for the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "attempts in this direction @xcite typically maintain the metric manifold structure of gr and change the dynamics of the gravitational field by effectively giving the graviton a small mass .",
    "it is thoroughly assumed that any infra - red ( ir ) modification of gravity must bring in at least one new mass parameter , corresponding to the scale at which such a modification becomes effective . however , that is not necessarily the case . in @xcite",
    "we put forward an infra - red modification of gr that does not involve any new adjustable parameter but that might require a substantial reassessment of the present understanding of gravity in the semi - classical regime . in this paper",
    "we review and refine the model sketched in @xcite and derive some of its cosmological implications .",
    "we start from usual semi - classical gravity , where matter fields are quantized on a curved background manifold , and we modify in the ir the operators of the matter field theory . in a cosmological setup ,",
    "operators corresponding to fourier modes of physical momentum @xmath0 are corrected by order @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the hubble parameter .",
    "the coefficient of such a modification is fixed by imposing an  ultra - strong \" version of the equivalence principle , which we are going to recall in the following .",
    "we argue that such ir - modified operators fail to be supported by a metric manifold structure at large scales .",
    "hence , the proposed modification seems to indicate a breakdown , for systems of size comparable to the inverse curvature , of the geometrical description of space - time as a metric manifold .",
    "it is known that there is a strict connection between the geometric properties of a manifold and the spectrum of the differential operators @xcite or the algebra of functions @xcite therein defined ; such abstract characterizations have occasionally been used for generalizing common geometrical concepts and the description of spacetime itself  @xcite .",
    "however , so far , attempts in this direction have always been applied to the uv and intended to modify spacetime at the smallest scales .",
    "although perhaps less intuitive , a modification effective in the ir  and at length scales set by the curvature  is appealing on both theoretical and observational grounds :    * the standard paradigm  gr + matter fields \" presents some difficulties that are arguably uv - insensitive , such as the cosmological constant problem @xcite and the black hole information paradox @xcite .",
    "such difficulties appear already at the semi - classical / low - energy effective level and therefore it seems unlikely that any modification at the plank scale or uv - completion of the theory might possibly address them .",
    "questioning the ir - side of the picture seems thus a valuable alternative . * the apparent acceleration of the universe",
    "is described in gr as something kicking in at some late - time epoch in the cosmological evolution and related to an extremely tiny mass scale .",
    "such a scale is adjusted _ ad hoc _ in the models of  dark energy \" , which , therefore , generically suffer from fine - tuning and  coincidence \" problems . the alternative view suggested here",
    "is based on the simple remark that any high redshift object is placed from us at distances of order the inverse curvature ( i.e. the hubble radius @xmath3 ) .",
    "hence , modifying the usual framework at a length scale set by the curvature  rather than fixed _ a priori _  will systematically affect any cosmological observation at high redshift , regardless of when such an observation takes place and without the need of any external mass parameter .    before summarizing the cosmological implications of the proposed deformation",
    "let us review the main theoretical idea : the ultra strong equivalence principle  @xcite . consider the vacuum expectation value of the local energy density of a ( massless ) field according to standard semi - classical gravity ; this can be expanded at high momenta as @xmath4 & = & \\ \\   { \\rm local\\ terms}\\ \\",

    "below , or reference @xcite , for the explicit expression in the case of a massive scalar in a flat frw universe ) .",
    "the stress tensor renormalization is a well - defined prescription to make sense of the infinities appearing in : the local terms can be subtracted by local gravitational counterterms ( cosmological constant , newton constant and higher order local operators ) .",
    "the finite non - local pieces left represent the genuine particle / energy content of the choosen ",
    "vacuum \" state .",
    "it is interesting to note that some of the difficulties afflicting the standard low - energy framework for gravity seem to be related to the spacetime dependent subleading terms ( the @xmath5s in the case considered above ) in the energy momentum vev expansion .",
    "the black hole information loss paradox is related to the presence of the non - local pieces , as they are the ones responsible for particle creation and for the evaporation of the black hole .",
    "we argue that also the cosmological constant problem is related to the presence of those terms , at least if we restrict the analysis to the level of non - quantized semi - classical gravity .",
    "such a problem appears in the renormalization procedure that we described earlier as the huge amount of fine tuning that is required to match the first quartically divergent piece of with its observed value .",
    "however , the quartically divergent term is not particularly worrisome by itself , essentially because it is a constant . in flat space",
    "we deal with it , by normal ordering or just by subtracting a constant , albeit infinite , contribution . in other words , as brutal as it might appear ,  the vacuum does not gravitate \" is a well defined prescription , as long as the contribution to be neglected is a spacetime - independent scalar .",
    "we are arguing that the main source of trouble is not the first term in , but the remaining spacetime dependent pieces , as they make the normal ordering prescription meaningless and the renormalization procedure necessary in the first place .    based on the above reasoning and encouraged by few ( more philosophical ) arguments explained below in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the conjecture at the basis of this paper is that _ there exists a theory that resembles standard semiclassical gravity at small scales but in which , as in flat space , all time - dependent pieces of ( the @xmath5s ) at any point - event , and for some  vacuum \" state , just do not exist_. since the terms that we want to get rid of are effectively ir with respect to the first quartically divergent part and can be calculated , we should be able to probe this theory by ir - completing standard semi - classical gravity .",
    "it is clearly not guaranteed that a consistent theory with the required properties exists in full generality beyond the example considered here ; if it does , its formulation will certainly require a major theoretical breakthrough .",
    "giving up the metric manifold structure  and dealing only with quantum operators  constitutes a significant technical difficulty . on the other hand ,",
    "compared to some of the subtleties of standard qft on curved spacetime  @xcite , the physical picture that we are insinuating is somewhat simplified , made trivial .",
    "we are conjecturing the possibility of describing , locally , the physical phenomena in exactly the same way as we do in flat space , and that the large scale - properties of spacetime have no effect whatsoever inside einstein s free - falling elevator .",
    "this is the spirit of the equivalence principle , that we are upgrading to the level of semi - classical gravity and making  ultra - strong \"  @xcite .",
    "the local resemblance to flat space is pushed to the level of the quantized fields , whose energy momentum tensor vev at any point - event is conjectured to amount , for some unambiguously chosen vacuum state , to the constant value @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we try to explore the conjectured theory through a sort of taylor expansion around gr , the zeroth order being a flat frw universe with a given scale factor @xmath7 and a spectator free scalar field in it .",
    "we isolate the first correction to the scalar field fourier operators that reabsorbs the quadratic divergence @xmath8 in . in a similar fashion",

    "[ sec9 ] .      the equivalence principle ( ep ) can be formulated simply as follows : _ inside a sufficiently small free - falling elevator you do not see the ( classical ) effects of gravity_. amusingly , such a cornerstone of modern physics is actually stating what ( where ) gravity is not , rather than what ( where ) gravity is ! among the many celebrated implications of general relativistic physics , the view that we aim to stress here is that ep forces us to consider and describe gravity as an ir phenomenon , whose effects are visible only outside the free - falling elevator .",
    "how ep turned into a consistent theory is well known : gravity is beautifully encoded in gr as the geometry of the physical space - time and therefore its effects are automatically suppressed within those systems that are much smaller than the inverse curvature . by changing ( curving ) the large - scale structure of spacetime , gr leaves the smallest systems free of classical gravitational effects .",
    "notably , the ir scale where non - gravitational physics breaks down is not a parameter of the theory , but is set by the local curvature @xmath33 .",
    "schematically , in three dimensions , the area of a two - sphere of radius @xmath34 and volume @xmath35 receives corrections from the flat - space expectation of the type @xmath36    the effects of gravity , originally banned from the free - falling elevator , reappeared , after the developments of quantum theory , through what one might call the back door .",
    "the fields quantized on a curved manifold are sensitive to the global properties of spacetime because their modes are defined on the whole of it . as a result , inside the elevator",
    ", you will generically experience , and possibly detect with your local instruments , the first excited level is typically at energy @xmath37 above the ground state and can not be excited by photons of much lower energies . however , the structure of the higher energy meta - stable states is often very rich , and energy differences among such states can be arbitrarily small .",
    "an atom , for example , has extremely fine energy transitions that , in principle , allow to  detect \" photons of wavelengths much larger than its size .",
    "] , particle creation because of non - local gravitational effects .",
    "clearly , the process of quantum particle creation does not contradict ep , which was formulated within the framework of classical physics .",
    "nevertheless , it is tempting to try a different path than the one historically followed : rather than imposing field quantization on top of a curved manifold , here we attempt to upgrade the equivalence principle and extend it to the quantum phenomena .",
    "thus , we will consider a stronger version of ep , in which all the effects of gravity are definitely forbidden inside the elevator , including the quantum effects that in the standard semi - classical treatment lead to particle creation .",
    "effectively , what we want is that _ for each matter field or sector sufficiently decoupled from all other matter fields , there exists a state , the  vacuum \" , that is experienced as empty of particles by each free - falling observer .",
    "_    following the discussion given in the introduction , a possible concrete strategy would be trying to reabsorb in the ir the non - local terms inside after the stress energy tensor has been renormalized by usual means .",
    "however , we will follow a different , more radical , plan .",
    "we will circumvent the usual procedure of stress - tensor renormalization and just try to cancel the time - dependent terms of the _ bare _ energy momentum tensor ( all terms inside except the first ) .",
    "in fact , the time - dependent pieces can arguably be reabsorbed with some ir modification , because they are effectively ir with respect to the quartically divergent term .",
    "moreover , bypassing the usual procedure of stress tensor renormalization might , at the same time , shed some new light on the cosmological constant problem , at least at the level of non - quantized semi - classical gravity .",
    "if , in the ir - completed theory , all the time dependent terms just do not exist , then we do not need to renormalize the stress tensor anymore .",
    "of course , we are still left with the leading spacetime - constant quartic divergence , but we can live with it and treat it , as we do in flat space , by normal ordering . finally , it is interesting to reabsorb the quadratic divergence in the ir , rather than with a local counterterm , because the required modification , as we are going to show , is of the right order of magnitude to give interesting cosmological implications .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * ultra strong equivalence principle : * for each matter field or sector sufficiently decoupled from all other matter fields , there exists a state , the  vacuum \" , for which the expectation value of the ( bare ) energy momentum tensor reads the same as in flat space , regardless of the configuration of the gravitational field . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as a  rather obvious ",

    "the most relevant cosmological effect is a departure at large scales from the local expansion rate ( e.g. eq . ) .",

    "for photons , the time dependent terms that we got rid of in the high momentum expansion   are absent from the very beginning .",

    "on cosmological scales , such a modification goes in the direction of an effective acceleration but is still too weak to give full account of supernovae observation  @xcite .",
    "it will also be interesting to modify , along these same lines , a black hole or a stellar solution , also to check the compatibility with constraints coming from the solar system and strongly self gravitating objects . at the level of order of magnitude estimate , however , we do not expect relevant corrections .",
    "the proposed modification affects those phenomena whose relevant length scales are of order the inverse curvature .",
    "atomic spectra and and nuclear physics should be untouched , even in the presence of strong gravitational fields .",
    "the reason is that the inverse ( ricci ) curvature is roughly of order @xmath193 , @xmath51 being the energy density , and this typically gives a huge number in atomic size units . for what concerns the solar system ,",

    "<S> we have recently proposed an  ultra - strong \" version of the equivalence principle ( ep ) that is not satisfied by standard semiclassical gravity . in the theory that we are conjecturing , </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum expectation value of the ( bare ) energy momentum tensor is exactly the same as in flat space : quartically divergent with the cut - off and with no spacetime dependent ( subleading ) terms . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such terms seems in fact related to some known difficulties , such as the black hole information loss and the cosmological constant problem . since the terms that we want to get rid of are subleading in the high - momentum expansion , we attempt to explore the conjectured theory by  ir - completing \" gr . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a scalar field in a flat frw universe and isolate the first ir - correction to its fourier modes operators that kills the quadratic ( next to leading ) time dependent divergence of the stress energy tensor vev . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to other modifications of field operators that have been proposed in the literature ( typically in the uv ) , the present approach seems to suggest a breakdown ( here , in the ir , at large distances ) of the metric manifold description . </S>",
    "<S> we show that corrections to gr are in fact very tiny , become effective at distances comparable to the inverse curvature and do not contain any adjustable parameter . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derive some cosmological implications . by studying the consistency of the canonical commutation relations </S>",
    "<S> , we infer a correction to the distance between two comoving observers , which grows as the scale factor only when small compared to the hubble length , but gets relevant corrections otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to cosmological distance measures are also calculable and , for a spatially flat matter dominated universe , go in the direction of an effective positive acceleration . </S>"
