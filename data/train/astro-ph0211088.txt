    "the formation of substellar companions within protoplanetary discs has received a great deal of attention since the first observation of an extra - solar planet ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) .",
    "to date many additional extrasolar planets have been observed ( see marcy & butler 2000 for a review ) , further fueling the interest in the formation of planets and the evolution of protoplanetary discs .",
    "the most widely studied planet formation mechanism is core accretion ( see lissauer 1993 ) in which planetismals grow by direct collisions to form a core which , when sufficiently massive ( @xmath3 ) then accretes an envelope of gas from the disc .    an alternative mechanism for giant planet formation is via the gravitational instability ( kuiper 1951 ; boss 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "this differs from core accretion in that a rocky core is not initially required and the process is extremely rapid .",
    "a keplerian accretion disc with sound speed @xmath4 , surface density @xmath5 , and epicyclic frequency @xmath6 will become gravitationally unstable if the toomre ( 1964 ) @xmath7 parameter @xmath8 is of order unity .",
    "a gravitationally unstable disc can either fragment into one or more gravitationally bound objects , or it can evolve into a quasi - stable state in which gravitational instabilities lead to the outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "the exact outcome depends on the rate at which the disc heats up ( through the dissipation of turbulence and gravitational instabilities ) and the rate at which the disc cools .",
    "it has been suggested ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ) that a feedback loop may exist where when @xmath7 is large cooling dominates and the disc is cooled towards instability . when @xmath7 becomes sufficiently small , heating through viscous dissipation dominates and the disc is returned to a state of marginal stability . in this way",
    "@xmath7 is maintained at a value of @xmath9 .",
    "gammie ( 2001 ) has , however , shown using a local model that a quasi - stable state can only be maintained if the cooling time @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the local angular frequency . for shorter cooling times , the disc fragments .",
    "this finding is consistent with pickett et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 ) that ` almost isothermal ' conditions are necessary for fragmentation , and defines a robust lower limit to the critical cooling time below which fragmentation occurs .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that self - gravitating discs strictly require a global treatment ( balbus & papaloizou 1999 ) , and while global effects are highly unlikely to stabilize a locally unstable disc , they could well allow fragmentation within discs that would locally be stable . in this paper",
    "we use a global model to test whether a gaseous accretion disc still fragments for @xmath12 and attains a quasi - stable state for @xmath10 .",
    "although our choice of parameters is more appropriate for protoplanetary accretion discs , the results may also be applicable for star formation in agn discs , which are expected to become gravitationally unstable at large radii ( shlosman & begelman 1989 ; goodman 2002 ) , and for star formation in the gaseous regions of spiral galaxies ( kim & ostriker 2002 ) .",
    "the three - dimensional simulations presented here were performed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , a lagrangian hydrodynamics code ( e.g. , benz 1990 ; monaghan 1992 ) . in this simulation",
    "the central star is modelled as a point mass onto which gas particles can accrete if they approach to within the sink radius , while the gaseous disc is simulated using 250,000 sph particles .",
    "both point masses and gas use a tree to determine neighbours and to calculate gravitational forces ( benz et al .",
    "1990 ) , and the point mass representing the central star is free to move under the gravitational influence of the disc gas . although the code can in principle continue running if the disc starts to fragment and high density regions form , it quickly becomes too slow to realistically continue in this manner . to continue simulating a fragmenting disc , point masses are created ( bate et al .",
    "1995 ) if the high density regions are gravitationally bound ( gravitational potential energy at least twice the thermal energy ) . as with the point mass representing the central star ,",
    "point masses within the disc may continue to accrete gas particles if they fall within the sink radius .",
    "an additional saving in computational time is also made by using individual , particle time - steps ( bate et al .",
    "1995 ; navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "the time - steps for each particle are limited by the courant condition and a force condition ( monaghan 1992 ) .",
    "we consider a system comprising a central star , modelled as a point mass with mass @xmath13 , surrounded by a gaseous circumstellar disc with mass @xmath14 .",
    "most of the simulations presented here considered a disc mass of @xmath15 , but a few were performed using @xmath16 .",
    "the disc temperature is taken to have an initial radial profile of @xmath17 ( e.g. , yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ) and the toomre @xmath7 parameter is assumed to be initially constant with a value of @xmath18 .",
    "a stable accretion disc where self - gravity leads to the steady outward transportation of angular momentum should have a near constant q throughout .",
    "a constant @xmath7 together with equation ( 1 ) then gives a surface density profile of @xmath19 , and hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction gives a central density profile of @xmath20 .",
    "the disc is modelled using 250,000 sph particles , which are initially randomly distributed in such a way as to give the specified density profile between inner and outer radii of @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the calculations performed here are essentially scale free . in code units ,",
    "we take @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . if we were to assume a physical mass scale of @xmath26 and a length scale of @xmath27 au",
    ", the central star would have a mass of @xmath26 , the circumstellar disc would have a mass of @xmath28 , or @xmath29 , and would extend from 1  au to 25  au , and 1 year would equal @xmath30 code units .",
    "since the aim of this work is to test whether the results obtained by gammie ( 2001 ) using a local model still hold globally , we use the same approach in our global model as used in the local model .",
    "we use an adiabatic equation of state , with adiabatic index @xmath31 , and allow the disc gas to heat up due to both pdv work and viscous dissipation .",
    "cooling is implemented by adding a simple cooling term to the energy equation .",
    "specifically , for a particle with internal energy per unit mass @xmath32 , @xmath33 where , as in gammie ( 2001 ) , @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 with the value of @xmath36 varied for each run .",
    "although the use of the above cooling time is essentially chosen to compare the local model results with results using a global model , it can also be related ( at least approximately ) to the real physics of an accretion disc .",
    "for an optically thick disc in equilibrium , the cooling time is the ratio of the thermal energy per unit area to the radiative losses per unit area .",
    "it can be shown ( e.g. , pringle 1981 ) that in such a viscous accretion disc , the cooling time is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the adiabatic index , @xmath11 is the angular frequency , and @xmath39 is the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) viscosity parameter .",
    "we use a global model to consider how cooling times of @xmath41 , and @xmath2 affect the gravitational stability of a viscous accretion disc with a mass of @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ surfdens ] shows the disc surface density , @xmath5 , at the beginning and end of the @xmath41 simulation . since we have not attempted to model the inner boundary condition in any detail , there is rapid accretion and a drop in surface density close to the inner boundary .",
    "apart from particles with radii between 1 and 2 being accreted onto the central star , the surface density profile does not change significantly during the course of the simulation .",
    "this also occurs for @xmath42 and a corresponding figure is consequently not shown .",
    "figure [ tc5disc ] shows the final equatorial density structure of the @xmath41 simulation . the central star ( not shown )",
    "is located in the middle of the figure and the @xmath43 and @xmath44 axes both run from -25 to 25 .",
    "figure [ tc5q ] shows the toomre @xmath7 parameter for the same simulation at the beggining ( @xmath45 ) , approximately a third of the way into the simulation ( @xmath46 ) , and at the end ( @xmath47 ) of the simulation .",
    "after @xmath47 time units , particles at the outer edge of the disk ( @xmath48 ) have completed 3.7 orbits while particles at @xmath49 have completed 466 orbits .",
    "the disc is highly structured and the instability exists at all radii .",
    "however , at no point in the disc has the density increased significantly and no fragmentation has taken place .",
    "figure [ tc5q ] shows that at @xmath47 ( dashed line ) the toomre @xmath7 parameter , which initially had a constant value of 2 ( solid line ) , is close to 1 for radii between 1 and 15 .",
    "comparing @xmath7 at @xmath46 and at @xmath47 suggests that the cooling may initially reduce q to below 1 , causing the gravitational instability to grow , heating the disc and returning @xmath7 to a value of order unity .",
    "figure [ tc5q ] also shows this region of low @xmath7 moving to larger radii with time .",
    "this is a consequence of both the cooling time and the dynamical time ( the timescale on which heating occurs ) both depending directly on radius .",
    "the instability therefore starts at the inner radii and by the end of the simulation has reached the edge ( @xmath48 ) of the disc .",
    "the disc has reached a quasi - steady state in which cooling is balanced by heating through viscous dissipation resulting from the growth of the gravitational instability .",
    "figure [ tc3disc ] shows the final equatorial density structure of the @xmath50 simulation .",
    "we were only able to run this simulation for a total of @xmath51 time units and hence figure [ tc3disc ] shows only the inner 8 radii of the simulation .",
    "the central star is again in the middle of the figure .",
    "figure [ tc3q ] shows the toomre @xmath7 parameter at three different times during the simulation .",
    "the initial @xmath7 for @xmath2 is the same as for @xmath41 and is therefore not shown in figure [ tc3q ] .",
    "figure [ tc3disc ] shows that not only is the disc highly structured , the bright dots also indicate that fragmentation is taking place .",
    "the fragments that can be seen in figure [ tc3disc ] are all gravitationally bound . to reach the time shown in figure [ tc3disc ] it was necessary to convert most of the fragments into point masses ( bate et al .",
    "figure [ tc3q ] shows that at @xmath52 @xmath7 is less than 1 for radii between 1 and 5 . at later times",
    "the minimum @xmath7 value moves to larger radii and the value of @xmath7 at smaller radii increases to a value of between 1 and 1.5 . as in the @xmath41 simulation",
    ", the gravitational instability grows from the inner radii and moves to larger radii with time .",
    "while @xmath7 is below 1 , the instability grows rapidly , producing gravitationally bound fragments .",
    "these fragments tidally interact with the disc , heating it and causing @xmath7 to increase to a value greater than unity .",
    "once @xmath53 fragmentation ceases , and the disc , at that radius , becomes gravitationally stable .",
    "there is , however , likely to be a significant amount of angular momentum transport driven by tidal interactions between fragments and the gaseous disc ( larson 2002 ) .",
    "simulations using @xmath54 and @xmath55 were also performed .",
    "both simulations were run for more than 2000 time units , almost @xmath56 times longer than the @xmath2 simulation .",
    "the @xmath57 simulation showed no noticeable structure and the toomre @xmath7 settled down to a value between @xmath27 and @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath55 the disc structure was similar to that obtained using @xmath41 except for the presence of a few high density clumps at radii of @xmath58 and greater . by the end of the simulation ( @xmath59 ) one of the clumps , at a radius of @xmath60 , had satisfied the condition for point mass creation , i.e. it was gravitationally bound .",
    "this would suggest that , globally , fragmentation may occur at slightly greater cooling time than expected using a local model ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath2 simulation , the @xmath55 simulation did not fragment at all radii , with the inner @xmath58 radii of the disc remaining in a quasi - stable state .",
    "a simulation using a heavier disc ( @xmath16 ) was also performed .",
    "although most t tauri discs have masses significantly less than this ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ) , there are a few with comparable masses .",
    "such a simulation may also be appropriate for an earlier stage of the star formation process when the discs are expected to be heavier .",
    "we considered cooling times of @xmath61 and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath54 simulation was run for @xmath62 time units , at the end of which , as for @xmath15 , the disc showed minimal structure and there was no sign of any density enhancement or fragmentation .",
    "the @xmath41 simulation was run for @xmath63 time units and the final equatorial density structure is shown in figure [ tc5md025disc ] .",
    "the disc is highly structured and the spirals , consistent with the increased disc mass ( nelson et al .",
    "1998 ) , are somewhat less filamentary then for the @xmath15 simulation with the same cooling time . unlike the equivalent @xmath15 simulation ( see figure [ tc5disc ] ) there are , however , a number of high density clumps present in the disc .",
    "the routine for converting these clumps into point masses checks the nearest @xmath64 sph particles to determine if they are gravitationally bound ( see bate et al .",
    "1995 ) . using this technique ,",
    "the high density regions in figure [ tc5md025disc ] were found to be gravitationally unbound and could not be converted into point masses .",
    "the simulation was eventually stopped at @xmath65 when the maximum density had increased to a value @xmath66 times greater than the initial maximum density . restricting",
    "the determination of the boundness of the clump to only the nearest @xmath64 sph particles is somewhat arbitrary . by including the nearest @xmath67 sph particles , rather than only the nearest @xmath64 ,",
    "the densest clump was found to be just gravitationally bound , i.e. the gravitational potential energy was almost exactly twice the thermal energy .",
    "this would imply that in more massive discs , global effects could act to make the disc more unstable , allowing gravitationally bound fragments to grow for cooling times greater than that obtained using a local model .",
    "this may have implications both for the formation of planets , or binary companions ( adams , ruden & shu 1989 ) , reasonably early in the star formation process .      by using a radially dependent cooling time in our simulations , equation ( [ tcool ] )",
    "implies that the discs should settle into a state in which the effective viscous @xmath39 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) depends inversely on this cooling time .",
    "since none of our simulations were run to a steady state , which would take several viscous times to achieve , it is not straightforward to determine whether the local scaling of @xmath39 with @xmath34 is obeyed .",
    "this is further complicated in the @xmath68 , @xmath15 simulation since the collapsed mass fraction increases throughout the run .",
    "we are , however able to compare the @xmath69 , @xmath15 simulation with the @xmath54 , @xmath15 simulation .",
    "figure [ masstrans ] shows the magnitude of the mass transfer rate through a radius @xmath70 , plotted against time in code units , for @xmath41 ( solid line ) and @xmath54 ( dashed line ) and a disc mass , in both cases , of @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ masstrans ] only considers the mass transfer rate once the instability has almost saturated at the radius considered .",
    "since neither simulation has reached a steady state and since both discs are self - gravitating , the mass transfer rate can be negative or positive .",
    "figure [ masstrans ] is consequently a @xmath71 time unit running average of the magnitude of the mass transfer rate and shows that the mass transfer rate for @xmath69 is , as expected , higher than that for @xmath54 . by the end of simulation",
    "the mass transfer rates are both reasonably constant and differ by a factor of between @xmath18 and @xmath72 .",
    "although this difference is consistent with that expected from equation ( [ tcool ] ) , the complications in trying to accurately determine the relationship between @xmath39 and @xmath34 in these global simulations leads us to simply conclude that , as expected , the effective viscosity does indeed increase with decreasing cooling time .",
    "using a local model , gammie ( 2001 ) has shown that for cooling times @xmath73 a disc will fragment into one or more gravitationally bound objects , while for longer cooling times the disc will settle into a quasi - stable state with heating through viscous dissipation balancing cooling .",
    "we have performed three - dimensional disc calculations using sph to test if the above still holds globally .",
    "we use the same cooling function as used by gammie ( 2001 ) which , although fairly simplistic , can also be justified physically ( pringle 1981 ) .    for a disc mass of @xmath15 and for cooling times of @xmath41 and @xmath54",
    "we find that the disc settles into a quasi - stable state . at the end of the @xmath41 run ,",
    "the toomre @xmath7 parameter is of order unity between radii of 1 and 15 and the disc is highly structured .",
    "the density is , however , not significantly greater than the initial density and no fragmentation has occured .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath41 and the @xmath74 simulations also shows that once the instability has saturated at a given radius , the magnitude of the mass transfer rate was greatest for the smaller cooling time .",
    "although we were unable to quantify the relationship between the cooling time and the viscous @xmath39 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , this result shows that , as expected , the effective viscosity does indeed increase with decreasing cooling time .",
    "for @xmath2 the disc rapidly becomes unstable and produces numerous gravitationally bound fragments .",
    "the growth of these fragments starts near the inner boundary of the disc and had we been able to continue with the simulation , it seems likely that fragmentation would have continued throughout the disc .",
    "a @xmath55 simulation also produced gravitationally bound fragments but these were located at radii of @xmath58 or greater .",
    "the inner radii of the disc remained in a quasi - steady state .    a simulation using a heavier disc ( @xmath16 )",
    "was found to fragment for cooling times of @xmath41 , suggesting that as the disc mass increases , global effects may act to make the disc more unstable .",
    "a cooling time of @xmath54 , however , showed no signs of fragmentation and hence the fragmentation boundary , even for the heavier disc , is still within a factor of @xmath75 of that obtained using a local model ( gammie 2001 ) . for t tauri discs , which generally have masses @xmath76 ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ) , the fragmentation boundary is therefore likely to be close to that determined using the local model .",
    "earlier in the star formation process , when the discs are expected to be more massive , fragmentation may occur for cooling times somewhat longer than that predicted by the local model results ( gammie 2001 ) .    for quiescent t tauri discs ,",
    "@xmath39 is conventionally estimated to be of the order of @xmath77 or smaller ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ; bell & lin 1994 ) .",
    "the simple estimates quoted earlier would suggest that such discs are comfortably stable . boss ( 2001 ) , however , has shown using an approximate treatment of the disc heating and cooling that there may be periods when the cooling time is comparable to the orbital period .",
    "our results suggest that if the disc is fairly massive , such short cooling times open a window of opportunity for the formation of substellar objects , probably in the form of a multiple system ( armitage & hansen 1999 ) .",
    "not only does this have implications for planet formation in protoplanetary discs , it also has implications for angular momentum transport .",
    "the presence of a number of massive clumps within a protoplanetary disc is likely to significantly enhance the transport of angular momentum through tidal interactions ( larson 2002 ) .",
    "similar considerations apply to agn discs .",
    "numerous theoretical studies ( e.g. clarke 1988 ; kumar 1999 ; hure 2000 ; menou & quataert 2001 ) show that agn discs invariably become self - gravitating at radii of @xmath78 .",
    "fragmentation would lead to the formation of stars ( collin & zahn 1999 ) , and truncation of the inner accretion disc ( goodman 2002 ) .",
    "instability of gaseous discs at much larger radii of @xmath79 pc may also occur ( shlosman & begelman 1989 ) .",
    "fragmentation of these larger scale discs would yield a flattened stellar system , while rapid angular momentum transport could play a role in replenishing the inner galactic resevoir ( shlosman & begelman 1989 ) .",
