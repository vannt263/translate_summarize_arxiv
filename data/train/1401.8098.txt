    "cygnus ob2 is not only interesting as a very active star forming region , but also as an association containing a wealth of massive stars .",
    "this population has been intensively studied over recent years both in terms of a general census @xcite as well as in terms of an extensive radial velocity survey ( @xcite , and @xcite for the most recent results ) . despite its heavy extinction ,",
    "cygob2 is therefore an interesting place for the study of massive stars over a wide range of wavelengths , including the x - ray domain .",
    "x - ray emission is a well - known property of massive stars of spectral type earlier than about mid - b . for single o - stars ,",
    "this emission is generally attributed to a distribution of hydrodynamic shocks produced by the so - called line deshadowing instability ( ldi , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the radiatively - driven winds of these objects .",
    "another mechanism to produce x - ray emission from single early - type stars is the head - on collision of magnetically channeled gas in the stellar winds of massive stars that feature a strong enough magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , in massive binary systems , additional x - ray emission can arise from large - scale shocks associated with wind - wind interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the shocks in magnetically confined winds and in colliding wind binaries occur at much higher mach numbers than ldi shocks and are thus expected to produce stronger and harder x - ray emission than the latter .",
    "already in the early - days of the discovery of x - ray emission of early - type stars with the _ einstein _ satellite @xcite , it has been found that the x - ray luminosity of o - type stars scales with their bolometric luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this relationship was subsequently confirmed and refined with large samples of o - type stars observed with _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , and more recently _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "this situation contrasts with that of wolf - rayet stars , for which there is no clear dependence between x - ray and bolometric luminosities @xcite and where some wolf - rayet stars remain undetected with current observatories ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same holds for the lower luminosity end of massive stars , where only a subsample of the b - type stars is detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of non - supergiant b - stars ,",
    "the winds are generally thought to be too tenuous to produce strong emission via ldi shocks and alternative scenarios such as low - mass pre - main sequence companions and magnetic wind confinement have been suggested @xcite .    despite some attempts for a theoretical explanation @xcite ,",
    "the origin of the empirical l@xmath1/l@xmath2 scaling relation of o - stars remained elusive for many years . from first principles , a steeper than linear relation",
    "would be expected for x - ray emission produced by ldi shocks should scale as l@xmath4 or l@xmath5 respectively for radiative or adiabatic shocks @xcite . ] .",
    "very recently , @xcite argued that the shocks in o - star winds are radiative , although the density of the winds remains in most cases sufficiently low to prevent the wind absorption from playing a significant role .",
    "turbulence in the radiatively cooling post - shock gas , could then lead to an efficient mixing of cold and hot material .",
    "assuming a scaling of the volume filling factor of the hot gas with some ad - hoc power @xmath6 of the ratio between cooling length and position in the wind , @xcite were able to recover the observed l@xmath1/l@xmath2 scaling relation .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite scenario predicts a change in the behavior of the l@xmath1 versus l@xmath2 relation at the high- and low - luminosity ends of the o - star domain , which needs to be tested observationally .",
    "indeed , at the high - luminosity end , winds should become optically thick and the eddington factor @xmath7 corresponding to the transition in spectral morphology from normal o / of - type stars to wolf - rayet characteristics . ] , whereas at the low - luminosity end the shocks should become adiabatic , resulting in a change of the l@xmath1 versus l@xmath2 relation .",
    "the _ chandra _ cygob2 legacy survey offers an ideal data set for such an in - depth study of the x - ray properties of massive stars , as it provides a large and homogeneous sample of objects from early b - type , over almost all categories of o - stars , and even several wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the data analyzed here are taken from the _ chandra _ cygnusob2 legacy survey . a full description of this project and details on the data reduction are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the survey consists in an overlapping @xmath8 raster mosaic of 30ks exposures with an 8arcmin pointing offset between adjacent fields .",
    "the sources in the central 42arcmin@xmath9 square region were typically observed four times at different off - axis angles .",
    "the survey reaches 90% completeness for @xmath10ergs@xmath11 at the distance of cygob2 . for our variability study of o - type stars ,",
    "we further include some spectra from the _ xmm - newton _ observations discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "cygob2 has a very rich population of massive stars .",
    "the field of view of the _ chandra _ survey contains a hundred stars classified as b - stars , 52 o - type stars and 3 wolf - rayet stars @xcite .      the sample of o - stars detected with acis spans a wide range in spectral types and luminosity classes , from o3i to o9.5v , although there is a clear dominance of spectral type o8v ( see fig.[sample ] ) .",
    "all 52 known o - stars in the field of view are detected as x - ray emitters .",
    "the information on multiplicity of our stars was taken from the latest results of the cygnus ob2 radial velocity survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and kobulnicky et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we have estimated the interstellar neutral hydrogen column density towards each source from the @xmath12 color excess following the conversion formula of @xcite .",
    "the color excess was evaluated from the observed @xmath13 and the intrinsic @xmath14 colors as a function of spectral type according to @xcite . for stars , where no @xmath13 data are available",
    ", we used the @xmath15 color - excess @xcite and the relation @xmath16 from @xcite .",
    "as expected for observations in cygob2 , the interstellar absorption is quite heavy , leading to n@xmath17 values that frequently exceed @xmath18@xmath19 ( see fig.[sample2 ] ) .      out of 108 b - type stars that fall into the field of view covered by the survey ,",
    "54 are detected as x - ray sources .",
    "the information on spectral types and multiplicity is taken from @xcite .",
    "unlike the situation for o - stars , the b - star sample probably suffers from severe incompleteness and our knowledge of its multiplicity is only fragmentary .    out of the nine known binaries in the sample ,",
    "all but one are detected in x - rays . as can be seen in fig.[sample ] , b0 stars have a higher detection rate ( 75% ) than b2 stars ( 40% ) .",
    "the distribution of the interstellar column density ( fig.[sample2 ] ) clearly indicates that absorption by the ism has no impact on the detection or non - detection of an x - ray source associated with a b - star .",
    "there are three wolf - rayet stars that fall in the field of view of the _ chandra _ survey : wr144 , 145 and 146 .",
    "all of them are detected as x - ray sources and they are all of the wc subclass , with wr146 being one of the few wn / wc hybrid stars @xcite .",
    "two of these three wolf - rayet stars ( wr145 and wr146 ) are actually part of binaries or higher multiplicity systems .",
    "all three stars have interstellar hydrogen column densities around @xmath18@xmath19 ( see fig.[sample2 ] ) and are considered probable members of cygob2 @xcite .",
    "the acis x - ray spectra were binned in such a way as to have at least 5 counts per energy bin .",
    "they were then fitted using xspec v.12.7 @xcite . for each source , we fitted both the spectra from different observations , provided there were sufficient counts in the individual spectra , and the total , combined acis spectrum . for the analysis of the global properties of the x - ray spectra ( sect .  [ global ] ) , we used only the combined acis spectra .    unless stated otherwise , we used optically thin thermal plasma ( apec , * ? ? ? * ) models with solar abundances according to @xcite .",
    "the majority of the spectra were fitted assuming a single plasma component . only in those cases where the spectra are of sufficient quality and where the addition of a second plasma temperature significantly improves the fit ,",
    "did we opt for a two - temperature model .",
    "the models used were thus : phabs*phabs*apec and phabs*phabs*(apec+apec ) , where the phabs component indicates the absorption model .",
    "the first absorption column was fixed to the interstellar neutral hydrogen column density derived above .",
    "the second absorption column is meant to represent the absorption by the stellar wind . at first sight",
    ", this might appear a crude approximation as the wind material is ionized by the photospheric radiation , whilst the model employed here assumes neutral material .",
    "however , this approximation impacts the spectrum only at energies below 1kev , which are anyway absorbed by the heavy interstellar absorption in cygob2 .",
    "another approximation comes from the fact that in real stellar winds , the absorbing and emitting materials are interleaved and a more sophisticated treatment of absorption is needed to fit high - resolution x - ray spectra of o - type stars @xcite . yet , for ccd spectra , such as those analyzed here , such complex models can not be fitted and the above simple models are sufficient to provide a general description of the x - ray spectral energy distribution .",
    "the acis spectra of the four brightest sources in our sample ( cygob2 # 8a , # 5 , # 9 and # 12 ) suffer from severe pile - up .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of these objects revealed orbital or long - term changes in the observed x - ray flux ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we have evaluated the pile - up fraction of the acis spectra via two independent techniques .",
    "first , we applied pimms to the best - fit parameters inferred from the _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra @xcite . adopting the lowest fluxes observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , we estimated pile - up fractions of 60 , 34 , 18 and 16% respectively for on - axis _",
    "_ observations of cygob2 # 8a , # 5 , # 9 and # 12 .",
    "of course , the sources were not observed on - axis for each pointing of the _ chandra _ campaign . for large off - axis angles",
    ", the degradation of the psf reduces pile - up .",
    "therefore , in a second approach , we estimated the pile - up fraction directly from the data , by looking at the maximum count rate of all the pixels within the psf .",
    "this approach confirms that the four brightest sources are most of the time subject to pile - up fractions well above 10% .",
    "chandra _ data of these sources are thus not considered further in this paper .",
    "the next brightest sources of our sample are cpr2002a20 , cpr2002a11 , mt91516 , cygob2 # 3 , and wr146 .",
    "the former and the latter two stars fall outside the field of view covered by the _ xmm - newton _ observations @xcite and we can only estimate the pile - up fraction from the _",
    "chandra_-acis data themselves .",
    "for the two remaining stars , we proceeded in the same way as for the four brightest objects , relying on the parameters derived by @xcite for the conversion from _ xmm - newton _ data . in this way , we estimate pile - up fractions of 3  10% for these five stars , except for obsid10961 where the actual data indicate a 15% pile - up fraction for mt91516 .",
    "we keep these objects in our analysis , although their spectra are probably affected by a moderate level of pile - up . as a test",
    ", we have repeated the spectral fits , using the pileup model implemented in xspec and based on the work of @xcite .",
    "the best - fit parameters are usually in good agreement with those obtained without pile - up corrections .",
    "the fluxes ( both observed and absorption corrected ) are on average 5  6% larger than without pile - up correction . because of some degeneracy between the plasma parameters and the pile - up model , some of the individual spectra yield larger deviations .",
    "we will thus include both solutions ( with pile - up correction and without ) when discussing the variability of these five sources .",
    "all other o - stars in our sample should have pile - up fractions of less than 5% , and we did not apply a correction in these cases .",
    "excluding the three o - stars with heavy pile - up ( cygob2 # 8a , # 5 and # 9 ) , we are left with a sample of 49 o - type stars .",
    "the fits of the spectra of 10 objects required two plasma components with different temperatures , whilst the remaining spectra were well fitted with a single plasma component .",
    "the distributions of the best - fit temperatures and wind column densities are shown in fig.[stats ] .",
    "for single temperature model fits , there is a continuous distribution of @xmath20 from about 0.1 to 1.4kev , with a prominent peak between 0.5 and 0.6kev .",
    "this looks quite different from the temperature distribution found for the o - stars in the carina nebula @xcite , which is rather flat between 0.1 and 0.7kev and lacks objects with higher values of @xmath20 .",
    "however , for ccd spectra with a low number of counts , there is a well - known degeneracy between the column density and the plasma temperature . in the present case ,",
    "the fact that we have found a significant number of objects that apparently lack a wind column density in the best - fit model ( see below ) could bias @xmath20 towards higher temperatures . to test this hypothesis , we also show in fig.[stats ] the distribution of @xmath20 for those objects where the best - fit wind column density is different from zero .",
    "this distribution actually lacks the plasma temperatures between 0.5 and 0.6kev that dominate the histogram of the entire data set .",
    "this confirms that most of the higher best - fit plasma temperatures are associated with a zero wind column density . for 2-t fits ,",
    "the lower temperature is generally below 0.3kev with a few exceptions .",
    "the second temperature spans a wide range of values , between 0.6 and 3kev .    for 27 stars out of the 39 fitted with a single plasma component ,",
    "the best - fit column of the wind absorption is found to be zero .",
    "one may thus wonder whether there are biases in our sample against the detection of a wind column .",
    "the most obvious candidates for such biases are the strong interstellar absorption towards most objects in cygob2 and the low flux level of some of the sources .",
    "we have tested both hypotheses .",
    "the interstellar column has no clear impact on the detection of additional wind absorption .",
    "there are however some hints for a potential bias against such a detection for the lowest flux objects ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "fig.[acispn ] shows a comparison of the observed fluxes inferred from the acis spectra analyzed here with the _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn count rates reported by @xcite for 17 objects in common . generally speaking , we find that the epic - pn count rates of most objects are larger than expected from the fluxes that we infer from the acis spectra",
    ". in some cases , the difference amounts to a factor two ( 0.3dex ) .",
    "we have also compared the fluxes obtained here with those derived by @xcite using the 2xmm catalogue .",
    "the fluxes of the brighter sources are in good agreement , whereas there are rather large discrepancies for the fainter objects . whilst some of the discrepancies could be due to variability ( see below )",
    ", it seems extremely unlikely that all stars would be fainter at the time of the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the current status of the cross - calibration of the _ chandra_-acis and _ xmm - newton_-epic instruments is discussed by @xcite .",
    "these authors compare the fluxes inferred from a sample of more than 50 clusters of galaxies that are fitted with optically thin thermal plasma models , as are our stellar spectra .",
    "these authors find that acis yields lower flux than epic , mainly in the lower energy range ( 0.7  2.0kev ) with typical differences of about 10% .",
    "this is less than the differences found here , but one has to bear in mind that @xcite focus on _ extended sources in an otherwise rather empty environment _ , whereas our study is concerned with _",
    "point sources in a crowded environment_. therefore , the most likely reasons for the larger discrepancies in our case are source confusion in crowded regions with _ xmm - newton _ , due to its coarser point spread function ( psf ) , and photon loss due to pile - up of the brighter sources for _ chandra_. we have inspected the impact of applying a wider extraction region ( such as required for _ xmm - newton _ data ) to the treatment of the acis data . compared to a 2.5 arcsec extraction radius ( as used typically for the acis data ) , an extraction radius of 28 arcsec leads to a 50  100% increase in the number of photons associated with a moderately bright source .",
    "this is due to contamination by a weak diffuse emission and/or a conglomerate of faint point sources .",
    "the situation is even worse for sources such as cygob2 # 8c where the extraction region in the _ xmm - newton _ data is affected by the wings of the psf of the very bright cygob2 # 8a . in summary , we conclude that most of the discrepancies seen on the fainter sources indeed stem from a contamination of the epic spectra by neighboring sources .      to investigate the relation between x - ray luminosity and bolometric luminosity , we rely on the x - ray fluxes and bolometric fluxes , which have the advantage of being independent of the distance of cygob2 . the x - ray fluxes were inferred from the best - fit models of the acis spectra .",
    "these fluxes were corrected for the interstellar absorption only , i.e.  they were not corrected for additional wind absorption .",
    "errors on the absorption corrected fluxes were estimated via the cflux command in xspec .",
    "the bolometric fluxes were computed from the @xmath21 magnitudes , assuming a value of @xmath22 and adopting the bolometric corrections of @xcite . when no @xmath23 , @xmath21 photometry was available , we relied on the near - ir photometry of @xcite .",
    "the resulting relation between x - ray flux and bolometric flux is shown in fig.[fxfbol ] .",
    "this plot reveals the well - known empirical scaling relation between the bolometric and x - ray luminosities of o - type stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "early - type binaries are a priori expected to be more luminous in x - rays as a result of the violent wind - wind interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , fig.[fxfbol ] does not show a clear overluminosity of the known binary systems in cygob2 ) , especially at phases / epochs when their x - ray flux reaches its maximum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the same conclusion was already reached by @xcite from a sample of massive binaries observed with _ rosat _ , @xcite for o - type stars in ngc6231 , @xcite for the general sample of o - type stars observed with _ xmm - newton _ , @xcite for the o - stars in the carina complex , and , most recently , by @xcite for the o - star population of ic2944 - 8 and havlen - moffat1 . in our sample ,",
    "the strongest over - luminosities are found for cpr2002a26 , cpr2002a20 , mt91516 , and cpr2002a11 .",
    "the corresponding points are labelled in fig.[fxfbol ] .",
    "the x - ray flux of the first of these objects is almost certainly spurious .",
    "indeed , the acis spectrum of cpr2002a26 has a very low number of counts and the error bar on the net flux is huge ( see fig.[fxfbol ] ) .",
    "its large absorption corrected x - ray flux results from the correction of an apparently low - temperature plasma ( @xmath24kev ) by the effect of a large interstellar column density ( @xmath25@xmath19 ) .",
    "the position of this point should thus be taken with extreme caution .",
    "the other outliers have much higher quality spectra and are thus robust .",
    "conversely , there are a number of underluminous stars towards the lower end of the range in bolometric luminosity explored by our sample .",
    "these are mt91611 , 420 and cp2012e54 ( three presumably single stars with a 1-t fit ) and cygob2#41 ( a binary candidate ) .",
    "the spectra of some of these objects are again of poor quality .",
    "we have thus built a new version of the figure , where we have discarded those data points that correspond to spectra with less than 30 counts ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fxfbol ] ) .",
    "we can then adjust the l@xmath1/l@xmath2 relation of the o - stars in cygob2 .",
    "for this purpose , we exclude the five data points corresponding to spectra with less than 30 counts , as well as the three overluminous systems ( cpr2002a11 , a20 and mt91516 ) , and we combine the data of cygob2 # 22a and # 22b ( see sect.[sec22 ] ) .",
    "let us start with a simple scaling law between the x - ray flux and the bolometric flux ( see also appendix [ annexe ] ) .",
    "we obtain the following result : @xmath26 where all 40 data points were given equal weight in the fit .",
    "this result is in perfect agreement with the scaling relation found by @xcite for the o - type stars in the _ chandra _ carina complex project . if we weight the data according to the square root of the number of counts in the spectrum , we obtain @xmath27 alternatively , we can also weight the data according to the cflux estimated errors on the x - ray fluxes . this time we find @xmath28",
    "both relations are fully consistent with the unweighted result .",
    "keeping the data points with less than 30 counts in the fits does not change the @xmath29 relation , but increases its dispersion .",
    "keeping also the overluminous systems further increases the dispersion and leads to a slight increase of @xmath29 but still within the uncertainties of eqs.[eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] and [ eq4 ] .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath30 for a sample of 26 ob stars in cygob2 .",
    "their relation is consistent with ours , but with a much larger dispersion than obtained here .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath31 for o stars of cygob2 in the 2xmm catalogue .",
    "this is 0.25dex brighter than what we find here . if we restrict the 2xmm sample to those stars that are not known to be overluminous ( either from _ xmm - newton _ data or from the present study ) , we are left with 20 objects which have @xmath32 .",
    "the difference is now reduced to 0.1dex .",
    "this remaining difference can stem from the issues discussed above and/or a slightly different treatment of the bolometric luminosity ( e.g.  differences in adopted spectral types ) .    following the suggestion by @xcite",
    ", we have searched for a scaling of l@xmath1 with @xmath33 . for this purpose",
    ", we need to estimate the wind parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we have based our evaluation of these parameters on the mass - loss rates inferred using the @xcite formalism and tabulated by @xcite , and on the assumption that @xmath36 @xcite for all o - type stars . if we restrict ourselves to the presumably single stars in our sample ( weighted according to the estimated errors on the fluxes ) , and discarding the two overluminous stars mt91516 and",
    "cpr2002a20 , we obtain @xmath37 this result is shown in fig.[fxmdot ] . in terms of the @xcite relation ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity should scale with @xmath38 over most of the spectral range of o - type stars , where the ldi shocks that produce the x - rays are radiative and the winds themselves are optically thin .",
    "we thus find that @xmath39 , which is slightly larger than the upper limit of the range ( 0.2  0.4 ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "we note however that there is considerable scatter around the relation given by equation[eq3 ] .",
    "this could indicate that either the relation is not tight , or that the values of the wind parameters are not well enough determined with the assumptions made here .",
    "our current results do not show a change in the @xmath29 relation towards the higher or lower luminosity end of the o - star range , as was suggested by @xcite . at the lower luminosity end",
    ", we actually find that the @xmath29 relation of o - stars holds also for the most luminous b - stars ( see sect.[bstars ] ) .",
    "concerning the high luminosity end , it must be stressed though that the wolf - rayet star wr144 clearly deviates from the relation in fig.[fxmdot ] .",
    "furthermore , the o - star population of cygob2 does not contain oif@xmath40 supergiants which are likely transition objects between o and wr stars , and would thus be the ideal targets to search for the predicted change in the @xmath29 relation at the highest luminosities @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , we find no indication of a strong x - ray overluminosity of the known binary systems in the acis data .",
    "yet it is interesting to consider this situation in a more detailed way .",
    "wind interactions in relatively short period o + ob systems are usually in the radiative regime where the x - ray luminosity of the wind - wind collision scales with @xmath41 .",
    "if we consider the known o + ob binary systems ( leaving the higher multiplicity system cygob2 # 5 aside ) with orbital periods shorter than 30days , we find indeed a roughly linear increase of the x - ray overluminosity with the kinetic power of the primary star wind , although the scatter is quite substantial ( see fig.[cwb ] ) .",
    "the two long - period systems cygob2 # 9 ( @xmath42days ) and # 11 ( @xmath43days ) , do not follow this trend .",
    "@xcite showed that the wind collision zone in cygob2 # 9 is indeed in the adiabatic regime , where the x - ray luminosity scales with @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the orbital separation .",
    "given its orbital period , a similar situation probably applies to cygob2 # 11 .      aside from the bright blue hypergiant cygob2 # 12 @xcite which suffers from pile - up in the acis data , the vast majority of the b - type stars in our sample are rather faint x - ray sources .",
    "first , we have performed a spectral fit for those sources with a sufficient number of counts in their combined spectra ( 35 objects out of 51 ) , using the same model as for the o - stars .",
    "there are two families in the best - fit parameters .",
    "the majority ( 2/3 ) of the objects have a spectrum that does not require an absorption component in addition to the ism column density .",
    "the @xmath20 of these objects lies between 0.2 and 4.4kev , with a mean of @xmath46kev .",
    "the remaining objects apparently require additional columns in the range 0.1 to @xmath47@xmath19 with a mean value of @xmath48@xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding temperatures are lower ( between 0.1 and 1.6kev ) , suggesting that the additional columns are due to the above - mentioned degeneracy between temperature and column density in the fits of x - ray spectra with a low number of counts .",
    "the x - ray plasma in the b - type stars appears to be generally hotter than in the o - type stars , although there is a large dispersion in @xmath20 for the b - stars .",
    "the lowest temperatures are usually found to be associated with early - type b - stars , although some late - type b - stars also have low @xmath20 and some early - type b - stars are found to have large @xmath20 .",
    "we have used the above fits to derive x - ray fluxes corrected for the ism absorption .",
    "for the 16 objects where no spectral fit could be achieved , we have derived observed and ism absorption - corrected fluxes , assuming that their count rates are consistent with a spectrum described by a thermal plasma model with @xmath49kev , absorbed by the sole ism column . the resulting distribution of x - ray fluxes versus bolometric fluxes is shown in fig.[fxfbolb ] .",
    "the bolometric fluxes were taken from @xcite .",
    "for those known b - stars that were not detected in x - rays , we have evaluated upper limits on the x - ray luminosities . for this purpose ,",
    "1-@xmath50 upper limits on the number of detected counts were estimated by inserting their position into the acis - extract pipeline .",
    "these were then converted into photon fluxes following relation ( 8) of @xcite , and into ism absorption - corrected fluxes assuming @xmath49kev and accounting for the ism column density .",
    "the results are shown by the downwards pointing open triangles in fig.[fxfbolb ] .",
    "the relation valid for o - stars that we have derived above , still holds for the brightest b - stars ( early b supergiants with @xmath51 , corresponding here to @xmath52 ) . for fainter stars",
    ", there is a huge dispersion . restricting ourselves to the brightest objects ( encircled in fig.[fxfbolb ] )",
    "would suggest a flattening of the l@xmath1/l@xmath2 relation ( see the case of ngc6231 , * ? ? ?",
    "this feature as well as the generally high plasma temperatures of b - stars could reflect x - rays from magnetically confined winds @xcite .",
    "however , studying a sample of early - type b - stars with known magnetic fields , @xcite found that hard and strong x - ray emission does not necessarily correlate with the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "moreover , such a flattening is not supported by the full sample .",
    "the same conclusion was reached from the data of the _ chandra _ carina complex project @xcite .",

    "however , an older observation ( obsid 4501 ) actually indicates a very similar , even somewhat lower , flux of @xmath112erg@xmath19s@xmath11 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the flux of mt91213 indeed varies by at least a factor three and that these variations can occur on short time scales . flares from an unseen low - mass companion are unlikely to explain this behavior , as the star seems to spend more time at a roughly constant high flux level , unlike what is seen in flaring stars .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed one of the richest samples of x - ray data of ob stars belonging to a single association .",
    "these data have shed new light on the x - ray properties of massive stars .",
    "we have shown that o - stars in cygob2 follow a well - defined scaling relation between their x - ray and bolometric luminosities with @xmath0 .",
    "this relation is in excellent agreement with the one previously derived from _",
    "observations of the carina nebula , suggesting that any environmental effect on this relation should be quite small .",
    "our investigation indicates that , owing to its narrow psf , _ chandra _ is the best mission to evaluate the x - ray emission of moderately bright and faint massive stars in crowded environments , whilst _ xmm - newton _ is better suited to study the massive stars at the x - ray brighter end .    except for the brightest o - star binaries , that we have not studied here , we do not find a general x - ray overluminosity due to colliding winds in o - star binaries , neither",
    "do we find a clear phase - locked variability in most of them . for o - star binary systems with short orbital periods",
    ", there is some tentative trend for an increase of the x - ray overluminosity with wind kinetic power , although this result clearly calls for confirmation .",
    "b - type stars do not show a clear relationship between their x - ray and bolometric luminosity , suggesting that their x - ray emission might come , at least for some of them , from a low - mass companion .",
    "finally , out of the three wc stars in cygob2 , probably only one ( wr144 ) is itself responsible for the observed level of x - ray emission , @xmath3 .",
    "the x - ray emission of the other two wolf - rayet stars in cygob2 can be accounted for by the emission of their o - type companion as well as a moderate contribution from a wind - wind interaction zone .",
    "the lige team acknowledges support from belspo through an xmm prodex contract , from the frs / fnrs and from an arc grant for concerted research actions , financed by the federation wallonia - brussels .",
    "mg and njw acknowledge support from _ chandra _ grant go0 - 11040x . njw was also supported by a royal astronomical society research fellowship .",
    "jjd was supported by nasa contract nas8 - 03060 to the _ chandra _ x - ray center and thanks the director , h.  tananbaum , and science team for continuing advice and support .",
    "facilities : _ , .",
    "@xcite argued that at least for evolved ob stars ( luminosity classes i - iii ) in cygob2 , a lower scatter is achieved for power - law relations instead of simple scaling laws .",
    "we have therefore tested a power law relation on our full data set , where l@xmath1 is allowed to scale with some power of l@xmath2 . the best - fit power - law relation ( for equal weights of all 40 data points )",
    "becomes @xmath114 adopting instead a weighting according to the square root of the number of counts in the spectrum yields @xmath115 in the same way , weighting the data according to the estimated errors on the fluxes leads to @xmath116    we have then considered the 13 o - type stars of our sample with luminosity class i - iii . these objects have @xmath117 ( unweighted ) , and @xmath118 ( weighted ; same relation for both types of weights ) . a power - law relation for the unweighted and weighted samples of giants and supergiants yields respectively @xmath119 and @xmath120 for weighting according to the square root of the total number of counts , and @xmath121 for weighting according to the estimated errors on ism - corrected x - ray fluxes .",
    "we see that , independently of the weighting , and of whether or not we restrict ourselves to the giants and supergiants , the exponent of l@xmath2 deviates by less than 2@xmath50 from unity ( i.e.  from a simple scaling law ) .",
    "our data thus do not support the need of a power - law relation , suggesting that a scaling law is sufficient to describe the dependence of l@xmath1 on l@xmath2 for o - stars of all luminosity classes .    restricting ourselves to the 23 presumably single stars of the cleaned sample , we obtain the scaling relation @xmath122 @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the unweighted data , the data weighted according to the number of counts , and the data weighted according to the estimated errors respectively .",
    "the corresponding power law relations are @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 within the error bars , there is no significant difference between the relations obtained from the full sample and those for presumably single stars only , even though including binaries leads to systematically higher average @xmath29 values ( as was also found e.g.  in the carina nebula , * ? ? ?",
