    "the world health organization lists migraines among the four most disabling chronic medical disorders @xcite .",
    "stroke is currently the third leading cause of death in developed countries .",
    "there is clinical and experimental evidence that in both conditions spreading depolarization ( sd ) waves of non - or - all type emerge .",
    "sd waves are characterized by massive redistribution of ions across cell membranes peaking after several seconds in a nearly complete neuronal depolarization , followed by a much slower recovery process taking up to minutes during which ion gradients are re - established towards their physiological values .",
    "this maximal ionic perturbation clearly distinguishes sd from all other brain states such as epileptic seizure activity , functional activation or the physiological resting state .",
    "the sequence of ionic perturbation and its recovery spreads at a pace of about 3  mm / min over cortical regions .    in migraine ,",
    "this phenomenon  originally termed _ spreading depression _ of activity in the cerebral cortex @xcite , causes neurological symptoms starting about 30  min before the headache phase @xcite .",
    "it is also currently debated whether migraine headache is caused by substances released in the course of sd @xcite . in stroke , so - called _ periinfarct depolarizations _",
    "@xcite , a variant of sd , occur and spread in the boundary zones surrounding a cerebral infarct",
    ". a greater number of sd waves is believed to worsen outcome .",
    "sd has been demonstrated in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury , ischemic stroke , subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haematoma @xcite .",
    "the difference between sd in migraine and stroke is that sd in the latter occurs when the cortex is deprived of adequate perfusion , i.e. , under ischemia , while sd in migraine occurs under normoxic conditions , but otherwise both processes share a common underlying neuronal mechanism @xcite , and they should not be seen as two different processes .",
    "for this reason they are referred to as _ spreading depolarizations _ @xcite .",
    "this name reflects the common mechanism rather than the effect ( depression of activity ) or location ( periphery of infarct ) of these waves as the other terms do . to focus on common macroscopic features",
    "is in particular advisable when two - dimensional spatio - temporal characteristics are investigated .",
    "moreover , it emphasises the depolarization wave as one of the common aspects within the complex bidirectional relation between migraine and stroke @xcite .",
    "for example , sd activity may play an important role in complications of migraine , including migrainous infarction , persisting migraine aura without infarction , and ischaemia - induced migraine ( symptomatic migraine ) .    in this study ,",
    "our aim is to understand the emergence of pathological spatio - temporal sd states in the cortex and possible transitions between them in terms of nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation .",
    "this approach complements more traditional clinical research methodologies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : experimentalresults ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mm ] , we propose a mathematical framework to model reaction - diffusion patterns that are controlled and modulated by weak nonlocal transmission , and in sec .",

    "we end with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "monitoring the spatio - temporal characteristics of sd in two spatial dimensions is crucial for studying this phenomenon , in particular from a clinical point of view .",
    "we present data from two experimental systems of complementary complexity each with a specific optical method .",
    "optical methods have much better spatial resolution than electrical measurements .",
    "they provide indirect evidence of sd .",
    "the information about the spatio - temporal development of sd is very precise since correlation between the optical signals and electrophysiological changes of sd are well studied @xcite .",
    "the chicken retina is a typical _ in vitro _ system used to study the formation of pathological activity pattern of sd by intrinsic optical signals @xcite .",
    "retinal sd can be easily observed by intrinsic optical signals , because it evokes an optical signal with an amplitude being several orders of magnitude higher than that observed in cortex .",
    "in fact , retinal sd can be observed by the naked eye as a milky front .",
    "moreover , the chicken retina is a very homogeneous neural tissue because it lacks blood vessels .",
    "the neural aspects of pattern formation can be thus studied in retinal sd in isolation , that is , without the neurovascular coupling , with the obvious disadvantage that retinal sd provides no information on this coupling .",
    "last but not least , the retina has , similar to the cortex , a layered structure with several layers of neurons interconnected by synapses and there is a solid knowledge of retinal network functioning @xcite .",
    "the chickens ( 4 - 7 days ) were decapitated and the eyes were carefully extracted from the orbit .",
    "the eye was purged from adherent muscles and connective tissue and afterwards the eye was equatorially divided .",
    "the vitreous body was gently removed , and then the eyecup including the retina was transferred into a small petri - dish filled with standard ringer ( r ) solution ( fig  [ fig : rsdstimmgbreak ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the standard ringer solution has the following composition ( in @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 glucose . throughout the experiment ,",
    "the submerged retina was perfused with fresh ringer solution . for more details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    following this preparation protocol",
    ", the healthy chicken retina has a dark appearance .",
    "since blood vessels do not course across the retinal surface , the only landmark , situated in the infero - temporal field , is the pecten oculi ( fig  [ fig : rsdstimmgbreak ] ( b ) ) , a highly vascularized organ with corrugated structure that projects from the optic disc into the vitreous body of the avian eye .",
    "the pecten is believed to nourish the retina .",
    "pectineal blood capillaries deliver nutrients to the retina , therefore , there are no retinal blood vessels .",
    "this fact , together with the intrinsic optical signal , makes the avian retina an ideal experimental system to study sd .",
    "all measurements were obtained with a ccd video camera and stored with a dvd - recorder .",
    "the retina was pricked with a fine tungsten needle to elicit a retinal sd wave . after measuring a control wave ,",
    "the standard ringer solution was replaced with a ringer solution where drugs had been added . after a time of 30 minutes",
    "a new wave was elicited .",
    "the experiments in chicken retina were approved by the local ethics committee ( stuttgart and magdeburg ) and the regierungsprsident of stuttgart and magdeburg .",
    "the choice of the cat as a species for studying sd has been governed by disappointing experience with the use of rodent models of stroke : none of the promising trials of neuroprotective agents in rodents , especially those that block sd , has been reproduced in clinical trials of the same agent . the cat cortex is closer than rodent cortex to that of humans in two important respects .",
    "first , it is gyrencephalic ( folded ) , whereas the rodent cortex is lissencephalic ( smooth ) .",
    "the data obtained establish beyond doubt that sd spreads via sulci ( clefts between gyral convexities ) , and never `` jumps '' between gyral convexities ; the information has allowed reliable interpretation of data from monitoring the human brain , and indeed provided a justification for the initial work ( with invasive monitoring methods ) seeking evidence of depolarisations in the injured human brain .",
    "secondly , the ratio of astrocytes to neurones in the cat brain is much closer to that of the human brain than it is in the rodent brain .",
    "this is important since the small energy metabolite pool in the brain , glycogen , is almost entirely located in astrocytes , again making a model of occlusive stroke in cats a more reliable analogue of human stroke than one in rodents .",
    "a further advantage of the cat brain is that the anatomical arrangement of its blood supply closely resembles that of the human brain .    in cat cortex",
    ", sd can be visualized by illuminating the cortex with laser light and imaging the resulting speckle pattern . the laser speckle contrast imaging can be used as a proxy for sd , because cerebral blood flow changes are almost invariably coupled to sd and so these changes can be studied as surrogate markers to image and map the occurrence and spread of sd in real time @xcite .",
    "the imaging observation field was chosen so as to achieve maximal spatial resolution in the area around the periphery of the initial stimulation site .",
    "[ fig : reentrantpid ] ( a ) illustrates the anatomy of the cat cerebral cortex , where the gyri are arranged in concentric arcs , in the order ectosylvian ( eg ) , suprasylvian ( sg ) , marginal ( mg ) gyri .",
    "the experiments in cats were approved by the local ethics committee and the regierungsprsident of cologne .",
    "in the following two subsections , we present the observed sd patterns in two experimental systems . we then develop in sec .  [",
    "sec : mm ] the conceptual framework for modeling sd on a macroscopic level that allows us to understand these experimentally observed spatio - temporal patterns of sd and possible transitions between them in terms of nonlinear dynamics . in sec.[sec : atcases ] , special cases are derived from this framework .",
    "an sd wave segment is a wave with a broken wave front and thus with two freely moving open ends .",
    "the open ends of the wave front allow more complex spatio - temporal dynamics , in contrast to a wave with a closed wave front or a wave where the open ends are attached to a non - excitable boundary .",
    "monitoring the dynamics of the open ends can be used to probe the tissue excitability , as we will first show experimentally and then develop the mathematical framework in the next section .",
    "travelling sd wave segments have , to our knowledge , neither been observed in cortex nor in any other grey matter brain region of any species .",
    "however , indirect evidence , presented in a recent study combining migraine patients reports and high - field functional magnetic resonance imaging , suggests that retracting sd wave segments cause migraine aura symptoms @xcite .",
    "we show here that these retracting waves can be observed in retinal sd by controlling excitability in a regime weakly susceptible to sd .",
    "this provides the first direct evidence that the recently predicted retracting waves exist in sd and that their emergence depends critically on the tissue excitability .",
    "an sd wave segment can be created from an initially closed circular sd wave front .",
    "the circular sd wave is created by local superthreshold stimulation .",
    "one way to break the sd front is by manually inducing a transient excitation block in the tissue in some confined location in front of the approaching wave . performing this procedure",
    ", the two open ends of the wave segment usually curl in to form a double spiral , whose wave front then repeatedly re - enters the same retinal tissue . in chicken retina , a spiral - shaped sd can rotate up to 20 times before its center collides with the tissue boundary @xcite .",
    "another way to obtain wave segments is to reduce retinal susceptibility to sd to a degree at which the wave front spontaneously breaks . in this case , the newly emerged open ends retract , as we show , and the wave vanishes invading the tissue only once .",

    "firstly , we describe the manual creation of a spiral - shaped sd wave to contrast this procedure and the resulting spatio - temporal development with retracting sd wave segments . retinal sd is elicited mechanically by gently touching the tissue with a sharp needle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsdstimmgbreak ] ( c ) , the stimulation needle ( s ) is seen by its dark shadow .",
    "after about @xmath9 , when the extension of the circular sd wave front has grown in diameter to about @xmath10 , we administer locally through a pipette a @xmath11 drop of ringer solution containing a tenfold raised @xmath8 concentration ( @xmath12_r=10\\,mm$ ] ) .",
    "pipettes having an inner tip diameter of about @xmath13 are best suited .",
    "they must be placed directly over the surface of the submerged retina without touching it and less than @xmath14 in front of the approaching sd wave ( fig .",

    "[ fig : rsdstimmgbreak ]  ( e ) , is indicated by dashed lines and its target position marked by an asterisk .",
    "the propagation of the circular sd wave is blocked around the pipette s target position and as a consequence its wave front breaks open .",

    "we now adjusted retinal susceptibility to sd by adding cocaine in a concentration range in @xmath16 concentration steps . at @xmath16 cocaine concentration ,",
    "sd waves propagated normally after being stimulated mechanically . at @xmath17 cocaine concentration , we observed a spontaneous excitation block . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsdcocaine ] ( c ) , this happens at a location where the retina appearance was less dark indicating a compromised tissue state .",
    "the tissue at this location is , however , still viable .",
    "after the cocaine is washed out , sd waves propagate normally again in the entire retina .",

    "the term _ collapse _ refers to an unstable , and therefore transient , sd wave profile that fades away although the front does not break .",

    "the reader is advised to run the video to see the patterns . ]      a single sd wave that repeatedly invades the same tissue forms a re - entrant pattern .",
    "a re - entrant pattern is easy to understand as a wave propagating around an obstacle .",
    "this obstacle can be a functional or anatomical block . in this subsection ,",
    "we present re - entrant sd patterns revolving around an anatomical block that develops after microinjections of high concentration of potassium have been locally administered to the cortical surface .",
    "firstly , we describe further in the next paragraph functional blocks in sd and re - entrant spiral patterns , whose creation protocol was introduced in the previous subsection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rsdstimmgbreak ] ( f ) ) .",
    "a functional block refers to a block that transiently forms as an intrinsic property of the 2d wave dynamics .",
    "the core of the rotating spiral center in retinal sd is an example of a functional block .",
    "since re - entrant sd waves with a functional block in the cortex have , to the best of our knowledge , not been reported , we refer here to the observed characteristics in the retinal experiments .",
    "the spiral core can be a circular area under certain conditions , but it is in general a more complex structure .",
    "for example , the core does not need to cover a spatially extended two - dimensional area , instead it can be an one - dimensional curved line ( inset ( a ) fig .  [",
    "fig : parameterplane ] ) , which itself performs a rotation , as is the case for retinal sd @xcite .",
    "the detailed dynamics of the core is a measure of susceptibility to sd and provides important information about macroscopic model parameters ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rd ] ) .",
    "in contrast to a functional block , an anatomical block refers to non - excitable tissue , possibly an infarct region or an artificially created lesion .",
    "sd patterns rotating around an artificially created lesion have also been called reverberation of sd waves @xcite .",
    "reverberation of sd was demonstrated in rat cerebral cortex and has been known for a long time .",
    "recently , data from monitoring the human brain has renewed interest in re - entrant patterns @xcite , in particular in experimental models of stroke to investigate the cause of infarct expansion , because more frequent sd waves are believed to worsen stroke outcome and therefore the emergence of re - entrant sd waves is of considerable clinical interest .    the creation of a re - entrant wave demands , in general , special initial conditions .",
    "sd is induced with microinjections into the cortex of @xmath24 potassium chloride ( @xmath25 ) . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : cat ] , laser speckle contrast imaging flowmetry is used to detect waves of regional blood flow alteration coupled to sd in a cortical field of view covering three gyri called marginal , suprasylvian , and ectosylvian gyrus ( mg , sg , and eg ) respectively ( fig .  [ fig : reentrantpid ] ( a ) ) .",
    "a radial pattern is regularly observed for the initial wave after an injection , starting from the point of @xmath25 injection and propagating outwards , often appearing as a concentric wave .",
    "this is demonstrated with a supplementary video ( video  1 , filename dahlemetalvideo.mov ) .    following the radial pattern ,",
    "an area of markedly reduced perfusion becomes established surrounding the injection point .",
    "we infer that an ischemic region develops at this site , most likely due to the marked vasoconstriction associated with high levels of @xmath26 concentration in the perivascular fluid . it is known that the perivascular administration of @xmath26 concentrations at levels of @xmath27 decreases pial arteries calibre by 47.2% and vein calibre by 13.5% @xcite .",
    "this significant reduction changes the conditions at the injection point and in its border zone .",
    "at least this assumption is consistent with the changes following the radial pattern and being observed in the surrounding of this developing ischemic focus .    during observation for 40 minutes following a @xmath25 injection , we saw new waves of hyperemia that developed spontaneously at the edge of the lesion , without any further @xmath25 injection .",
    "surprisingly , these secondary waves did not propagate radially but instead each revolves several times the ischemic focus .",
    "this is demonstrated in the supplementary video ( video  1 , filename dahlemetalvideo.mov ) .",
    "similar perilesion re - entrant patterns have been seen around experimental ischaemic lesions in the cerebral cortex after occlusion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , note that re - entrant patterns result in consistent periodicity of depolarizations when monitored at a single cortical point , and such periodic events have also been seen in the injured human brain @xcite .",
    "in this section , we develop the conceptual framework for modeling sd on a macroscopic level .",
    "this framework consists of a continuum model of the cortex in which the communication between neurons is separated in two major schemes : ( i ) local coupling , and ( ii ) nonlocal coupling in space and time . in the cortex ,",
    "these schemes represent ( i ) diffusion , and ( ii ) network communication and neurovascular feedback . with this framework general information in gained on how reaction - diffusion patterns of phathological states in the cortex are controlled and modulated by weak nonlocal transmission schemes .",
    "we apply this framework in sec .",
    "[ sec : atcases ] to interpret the experimentally observed patterns , in particular , their emergence and transitions .",
    "the level of detail and complexity of our framework is determined by both spatial extension and propagation speed of the emerging patterns .",
    "sd waves extend in the cortex over several centimeters and spread with a remarkably slow speed of several millimeters per minute .",
    "the extension of sd patterns suggests that its mathematical description should be in terms of large - scale activity in neural populations and describe how this activity affects the cortical ionic equilibrium ( homeostasis ) .",
    "the slow speed of sd ( about @xmath28 ) indicates that diffusion in cortical tissue plays a major role .",
    "therefore , the central parts of a macroscopic continuum model of sd are reaction rate terms and diffusion terms .",
    "these terms are supplemented by additional terms reflecting augmented transmission capabilities .",
    "within such a framework , the model equation is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a short hand notation for the derivative with respect to time .",
    "the terms on the right hand side represent ( i ) reaction rates @xmath31 and @xmath32 of a simplified activator(@xmath33)-inhibitor(@xmath34 ) model of cortical homeostasis ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ai ] ) , ( ii ) diffusion of chemical signals and other local transmission schemes summarized under the term _ volume transmission _ in the brain and described by the diffusion operator @xmath35 ( sec .",

    "sec : at ] ) . the model equation  ( [ eq : main ] ) and also its derived special cases ( sec.[sec : atcases ] ) are nondimensionalized equations . in such systems , natural units of a system are used in a systematic manner so that the input and output variables of the rate functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in the order of unity .",
    "therefore , beside many other advantages , nondimensionalization suggests explicitly a parameter , namely @xmath37 that should be used for analyzing this pattern forming system .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 indicates how much slower the production rate of the inhibitor @xmath34 is compared to the one of the activator @xmath33 .",
    "local dynamics of activator - inhibitor type are common in pattern forming systems , and  if they are coupled by diffusion  have been shown to govern several aspects of sd wave propagation @xcite .",

    "this configuration usually results from the parameter vicinity of an oscillatory regime whose large amplitude limit cycle is suddenly destroyed . a rest state ( fixed point )",
    "is usually the only attractor in the excitable regime",
    ". there exists also a threshold close to this rest state , e.g. , a separatrix or a sharp trajectory , that must be crossed by a stimulation to result in phase space excursion .",

    "[ sec : ehg ] and the validity and applicability of generic dynamics to model sd is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "communication between neurons is usually classified in two schemes : wiring and volume transmission @xcite .",

    "waves caused by nonlinear reactions coupled by diffusion of monovalent ions travel at speeds in the order of @xmath41 assuming moderate reaction rates in the nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",

    "we do not consider cross - diffusion , therefore off - diagonal entries vanish .",
    "the foam - like geometry of the interstitial space renders diffusion in the brain different from aqueous solution .",
    "in particular , apparent diffusion coefficients should be considered in a dimensionalized model @xcite . in our nondimensionalized framework ,",
    "diffusion coefficients of activator and inhibitor , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , do not appear explicitly .",
    "only the ratio @xmath46 of the diffusion coefficients enters eq .",

    "[ fig : sdpathways ] ) , in which case the inhibitor would not be subject to diffusion and therefore we choose @xmath47 in this study .      similar to the diffusion operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) , the operator @xmath36 describes the augmented transmission capabilities as @xmath48 @xmath49 is a operator specifying the augmented transmission ( in analogy to the laplace operator @xmath43 for volume transmission ) , examples are given in sec .",

    "[ eq : d ] ) so that the operator @xmath52 represents three individual steps of augmented transmission , namely ( i ) selecting a species @xmath53 whose transmission capability is augmented , ( ii ) creating the nonlocal driving force from this species , and ( iii ) feeding this driving force back , multiplied by the coupling strength @xmath54 , into the dynamical variable of species @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 describes the coupling strength relative to the diffusion coefficient , which is normalized to unity .",
    "therefore , the @xmath50 are also normalized to unity , i.e. , @xmath57 and we limit our framework to cases where @xmath58 holds . with the constraints in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : anorm])-([eq : klimit ] ) diffusion becomes the dominant coupling .",
    "we pose these constraints , because , within this framework , augmented transmission capabilities must not become an essential part of the sd wave propagation mechanism . rather we assume ( i ) that the propagation of sd can be explained even for @xmath59 , but ( ii ) that only for @xmath60 and appropriate choices of @xmath50 and @xmath49 the observed two - dimensional sd patterns are described correctly , because augmented transmission determines the specific spatial evolution of an sd wave on the two - dimensional cortical surface .",
    "we pose one further constraint on augmented transmission , in addition to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , namely on the choices of @xmath49 .",
    "the operators @xmath49 should be , in contrast to volume transmission , of nonlocal nature .",
    "these two constraints , summarized as _ weak nonlocal coupling _ , are the key to incorporating just the right amount of flexibility in this framework .",
    "the nonlocality , on one hand , addresses wiring transmission by describing the effect of the structural and functional cortical connectivity on sd , and , on the other hand , includes changes in cerebral blood flow in response to sd and how these changes are fed back to change subsequent neural activity , a feedback process termed neurovascular coupling .",
    "wiring transmission and neurovascular coupling can include nonlocalities in both space and time .",
    "for wiring transmission , nonlocalities in space are due to long - range lateral cortical connections , and nonlocalities in time are due to increased open probabilities of metabotropic receptors in the range of seconds after their activation .",
    "the traveling speed of action potentials along lateral cortical connections and the ionotropic synaptic transmission are , compared to the speed of sd , quasi instantaneous .",
    "nonlocality in space for neurovascular coupling , that is , how localized the vascular response is , also referred to as the vascular point spread function , depends on which component of the vascular system is considered . while changes to capillaries , i.e. , the smallest component controlled by pericytes @xcite , can be considered as a localized transmission in space , compared to the sd wave size , changes to arterioles and arteries have wider point spread functions .",
    "latencies in the neurovascular coupling in the order of seconds are typical and cause nonlocalities in time .",
    "moreover , wiring transmission and neurovascular coupling can act in combination to constitute a nonlocal transmission scheme .",
    "for example , the sd wave will activate quasi instantaneously a wide spread increase in neural activity through feed - forward and feedback cortical circuitry that induces therefore a spatially global but time - delayed neurovascular response .    in sec .",

    "we have presented a mathematical framework for cortical spreading depolarizations that unifies existing activator - inhibitor models as special cases @xcite . within this framework the reaction - diffusion mechanism of sd is extended by nonlocal coupling as an integral part of the phenomenon necessary to describe the emergence and transitions of two - dimensional sd wave patterns . as a framework it provides a flexible procedure for analysing sd patterns observed in both experimental migraine and stroke models , and clinical data @xcite .",
    "this framework is aimed at providing basic insights needed to understand cortical susceptibility to transient sd wave propagation in terms of nonlinear science . in particular , we focus on bifurcations in the dynamics of cortical homeostasis caused by cortical circuits and neurovascular coupling represented as nonlocal transmission schemes .",
    "a long term goal is to provide control strategies based on bifurcation theory for both traditional pharmacological treatments and biomedical engineered devices that intelligently target the occurrence of sd waves .    a mathematical model that involves only two species with activator - inhibitor dynamics is undoubtedly a very crude macroscopic level of cortical homeostasis .",

    "little insight into microscopic mechanisms of sd is offered by such minimal dynamic systems .",
    "there are much more sophisticated mathematical descriptions of sd on a detailed microscopic level that try to resolve the mechanism of sd @xcite . in our framework , these microscopic mechanism are hidden inside the box labeled as `` firing rate '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdpathways ] ) .    proposing a conceptual framework at this macroscopic level must be justified by showing that this approach avoids deficiencies that would arise if sd wave propagation is modeled on a microscopic level . from the clinical perspective , the macroscopic scale , in particular , the two - dimensional pattern on the cortical surface , is highly relevant . in migraine , the whole spectrum of aura subtypes could depend critically on whether sd can break away from a focus point , and , if it does , whether sd waves take the shape of a particle - like wave and therefore limit the extent of a full - scale attack to certain cortical regions ( fig .  [",

    "[ fig : persistent ] ) . in stroke ,",
    "outcome depends on sd as these waves are suspected to contribute to the loss of potentially salvageable tissue , i.e. , tissue at risk of infarction .",

    "none of these questions can be addressed in a cellular model of sd including only one or several neurons , let alone the semantic objection against applying the term _ spreading _ to such models because they are not meant to model the spread @xcite .",
    "microscopic models include several ion channel types in a single neuron , and its dendritic tree .",
    "these models also consider surrounding compartments , and can therefore also describe changes in intra- and extracelluar ion concentrations @xcite . to obtain the continuum limit of such discrete microscopic cellular models is by no means straightforward .",
    "the problem is to match the very detailed and accurate knowledge of microscopic processes involved in the depolarization cycle of sd by an equally detailed description of volume transmission and wiring transmission needed to provide the spatial coupling for transition to the continuum limit . mismatching these levels of description by merely using a diffusion term as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) to simulate spatial coupling by extracellular potassium would be like attaching the wheels of a carriage on a mercedes .",
    "efforts have been made to address this problem by accounting not only for interstitial ionic diffusion but also for ionic movement through a neuronal syncytium of cells connected by gap junctions and for cells that are allowed to expand in response to osmotic pressure . from these",
    "it was concluded that cytosolic diffusion via gap junctions and osmotic forces are important mechanisms underlying sd @xcite . yet , to compute the spatio - temporal development of sd across the cortical surface on a centimeter scale and investigate the emergence of retracting , re - entrant , and stationary sd waves , coupling schemes other than local schemes must be accounted for .",
    "there are important nonlocal transmission schemes in the cortex hat provide spatial coupling over a long range or lead to time delays .",
    "example are ( i ) the functional and structural cortical connectivity , in the continuum limit described by neural fields @xcite , ( ii ) the cortical energy state maintained by a segmental blood perfusion from the arteries to smaller arterioles and finally branching capillaries leading to a complex hemodynamic response that is regulated by smooth muscle cells ( arterioles ) and pericytes ( capillaries ) @xcite , and ( iii ) the topology of the network of the neuronal syncytium that will be compromised by disseminate neuronal injury during ischemia @xcite .",
    "there are more transmission schemes , but the effect of these ( i)-(iii ) are the ones we have considered in a first approximation by ( i ) long - range connections , ( ii ) global coupling , and ( iii ) spatial diversity .",
    "future investigations have to relate the quantitative values of the parameters in macroscopic model that successfully describe the bifurcations observed in the spatio - temporal characteristics of sd to the cellular level .",
    "this will open up this approach for the design of both drug treatments @xcite and engineered devices utilizing transcranial stimulation @xcite with the aim to target sd intelligently .",
    "migraine and stroke are found in specific genetic disorders giving clues to genetic factors that hint at differences in the cortical network activity .",
    "such hints may provide means to bridge the gap between the macroscopic and microscopic level of sd .",
    "similar hints of changed network activity are coming from psychophysics describing abnormal cortical processing in migraine by concepts like hyper- and hypoexcitability , heightened responsiveness , a lack of habituation and/or a lack of intra - cortical inhibition @xcite . our framework provides means by which such statements on cortical excitability in migraine can be investigated , in particular how abnormal cortical nonlocal connectivity changes susceptibility to sd .",
    "although it seems tempting to suggest that cortical hyperexcitability increases susceptibility to sd or even that neurons prone to hyperexcitabilty trigger sd , such a simple relation can not be expected , and a detailed bifurcation analysis will be important for the thorough understanding of sd as a nonlinear pattern formation process .",

    "<S> we present spatio - temporal characteristics of spreading depolarizations ( sd ) in two experimental systems : retracting sd wave segments observed with intrinsic optical signals in chicken retina , and spontaneously occurring re - entrant sd waves that repeatedly spread across gyrencephalic feline cortex observed by laser speckle flowmetry . a mathematical framework of reaction - diffusion systems with augmented transmission capabilities is developed to explain the emergence and transitions between these patterns . </S>",
    "<S> our prediction is that the observed patterns are reaction - diffusion patterns controlled and modulated by weak nonlocal coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the described spatio - temporal characteristics of sd are of important clinical relevance under conditions of migraine and stroke . in stroke </S>",
    "<S> , the emergence of re - entrant sd waves is believed to worsen outcome . in migraine , retracting sd wave segments cause neurological symptoms and transitions to stationary sd wave patterns may cause persistent symptoms without evidence from noninvasive imaging of infarction .    </S>",
