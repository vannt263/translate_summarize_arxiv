    "this is a rapidly evolving domain , and at present , only 8 systems are published ( cf table 1 ) .",
    "the search of co lines at high @xmath8 has been triggered by the detection of the co(3 - 2 ) line in emission in the faint iras source f10214 + 4724 at @xmath17 by brown & vanden bout ( 1991 , 1992 ) . at this time , it was a redshift 30 times larger than that of the most distant co emission discovered in a galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath11 mass derived was reaching 10@xmath18 m@xmath10 , with the standard co - h@xmath11 conversion ratio , a huge mass although the fir to co luminosities was still compatible with that of other more nearby starbursts .",
    "since then , the derived h@xmath11 mass has been reduced by large factors , both with better data and realizing that the source is amplified through a gravitational lens by a large factor ( solomon et al 1992 , 1997 ) .",
    "after the first discovery , many searches for other candidates took place , but they were harder than expected , and only a few , often gravitationally amplified , objects have been detected : the lensed cloverleaf quasar h 1413 + 117 at @xmath19 ( barvainis et al .",
    "1994 ) , the lensed radiogalaxy mg0414 + 0534 at @xmath20 ( barvainis et al .",

    "1998 ) , at @xmath22 , and the magnified bal quasar apm08279 + 5255 , at @xmath23 , where the gas temperature derived from the co lines is @xmath24 200k , maybe excited by the quasar ( downes et al .",
    "recently scoville et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported the detection of the first non - lensed object at @xmath25 , the weak radio galaxy 53w002 , and guilloteau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the radio - quiet quasar bri 1335 - 0417 , at @xmath26 , which has no direct indication of lensing .",
    "if the non - amplification is confirmed , these objects would contain the largest molecular contents known ( 8 - 10 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 with a standard co / h@xmath11 conversion ratio , and even more if the metallicity is low ) .",
    "the derived molecular masses are so high that h@xmath11 would constitute between 30 to 80% of the total dynamical mass ( according to the unknown inclination ) , if the standard co / h@xmath11 conversion ratio was adopted .",
    "the application of this conversion ratio is however doubtful , and it is possible that the involved h@xmath11 masses are 3 - 4 times lower ( solomon et al . 1997 ) .",

    "( 1997 ) ; ( 8) omont et al . ( 1996 )    it is surprising that very few starburst galaxies have been detected in the co lines at intermediate redshifts ( between 0.3 and 2 ) , although many have been observed ( e.g yun & scoville 1998 , lo et al 1999 ) .",
    "a possible explanation is the lower probability of magnification by lenses in this range ( cf figure 1 ) .",
    "most of the previous sources , detected in the co lines , had previously been detected in the dust continuum . at high redshift , it becomes easier to detect the dust emission , because of the large k - correction ( e.g. blain & longair 1993 ) : the emission is roughly varying as @xmath29 with the frequency @xmath30 in the millimeter range , until the maximum around 60@xmath5 m . at one mm , it is even easier to detect objects at @xmath31 than @xmath32 .",
    "this has motivated deep searches in blank fields with sensitive instruments , since they should be dominated by high redshift objects , if they exist in sufficient numbers .",
    "their detection will give information about the star - formation rate as a function of redshift , a debated question : the maximum of star - formation rate , found around @xmath33 = 2 from optical studies ( madau et al 1996 ) could shift to higher @xmath8 if dust is obscuring the higher - redshift objects . from recent infrared lines observations ( pettini et al 1998 ) , it does not seem a serious problem , however .",
    "the first search was made with the scuba bolometer on jcmt ( hawaii ) towards a cluster of galaxies , thought to serve as a gravitational lens for high-@xmath8 galaxies behind ( smail et al 1997 ) .",
    "the amplification is in average a factor 2 .",
    "a large number of sources were found , all at large redshifts ( @xmath34 ) , extrapolated to 2000 sources per square degree ( above 4mjy ) , revealing a large positive evolution with redshift , i.e. an increase of starbursting galaxies .",
    "searches toward the hubble deep field - north ( hughes et al 1998 ) , and towards the lockman hole and ssa13 ( barger et al 1998 ) , have also found a few sources , allowing to derive a similar density of sources : 800 per square degree , above 3 mjy at 850 @xmath5 m .",
    "this already can account for 50% of the cosmic infra - red background ( cirb ) , that has been estimated by puget et al ( 1996 ) and hauser et al ( 1998 ) from cobe data .",
    "the photometric redshifts of these sources range between 1 and 3 .",
    "their identification with optical objects might be uncertain ( richards 1998 ) .",
    "however , hughes et al ( 1998 ) claim that the star formation rate derived from the far - infrared might be in some cases 10 times higher than derived from the optical , due to the high extinction .",
    "if only some of the sources have a redshift higher than 4 , it will flatten the madau curve at high @xmath8 .",
    "eales et al ( 1999 ) surveyed some of the cfrs fields at 850@xmath5 m with scuba and found also that the sources can account for a significant fraction of the cirb background ( @xmath24 30% ) .",
    "their interpretation in terms of the star formation history is however slightly different , in that they do not exclude that the submm luminosity density could evolve in the same way as the uv one .",
    "deep galaxy surveys at 7 and 15@xmath5 m with isocam also see an evolution with redshift of star - forming galaxies : heavily extincted starbursts represent less than 1% of all galaxies , but 18% of the star formation rate out to @xmath32 ( flores et al 1999 ) .",
    "absorption techniques are also very efficient in the millimeter range , and a few systems have been discovered at high redshift , between @xmath8 = 0.2 to 1 in the last years ( wiklind & combes 1994 , 95 , 96 ; combes & wiklind 1996 ) .",
    "the sensitivity is such that a molecular cloud on the line of sight of only a few solar masses is enough to detect a signal , while in emission , upper limits at the same distance are of the order of 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "some general properties of the known absorbing systems are summarised in table 2 .",
    "they reveal to be the continuation at high column densities ( 10@xmath3510@xmath13 @xmath14 ) of the whole spectrum of absorption systems , from the ly@xmath36 forest ( 10@xmath3710@xmath38 @xmath14 ) to the damped ly@xmath36 and hi 21 cm absorptions ( 10@xmath3810@xmath35 @xmath14 ) .",

    "1992 , 1993 , 1998    about 15 different molecules have been detected in absorption at high redshifts , in a total of 30 different transitions .",
    "this allows a detailed chemical study and comparison with local clouds ( wiklind & combes 1997 , carilli et al 1998 ) . up to now , no significant variations in abundances have been found as a function of redshift , at least within the large intrinsic dispersion already existing within a given galaxy .",
    "note that the high redshift allows us to detect some new molecular lines , never observed from the ground at @xmath78 , such as o@xmath11 ( combes et al 1997 ) , h@xmath11o or lih ( combes & wiklind 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "molecular oxygen has not yet been detected in space , and water vapour appears to be extended and cold ( see also the swas satellite preliminary results , melnick et al 1999 ) .",
    "primordial molecules are thought to play a fundamental role in the early universe , when stellar nucleosynthesis has not yet enriched the interstellar medium . after the decoupling of matter and radiation , the molecular radiative processes , and the formation of h@xmath11 , hd and lih contribute significantly to the thermal evolution of the medium ( e.g. puy et al 1993 , haiman , rees & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "lih has the lowest rotational first level ( @xmath79 above the ground level ) and plays a unique role in the cooling of primordial clouds .",
    "unfortunately , the first transition of hd is at very high frequency ( 2.7 thz ) , and the first lih line , although only at 444 ghz , is not accessible from the ground at @xmath80 due to h@xmath11o atmospheric absorption .",
    "although the li abundance is low ( 10@xmath81 - 10@xmath82 ) , the observation of the lih molecule in the mm range is facilitated by its large dipole moment , @xmath83 debye .",
    "it has been proposed that the lih molecules could smooth the primary cbr ( cosmic background radiation ) anisotropies , due to resonant scattering , or create secondary anisotropies , and they could be the best way to detect primordial clouds as they turn - around from expansion ( e.g. maoli et al 1996 ) .",
    "this motivated a search for lih at very high redshifts ( @xmath84 ) , which resulted in upper limits ( de bernardis et al 1993 ) .",
    "the predictions of the lih abundance changed drastically in recent years , from the value of lih / h@xmath11 as high as 10@xmath85 corresponding to a primordial lih / h ratio of @xmath2410@xmath86 ( lepp & shull 1984 ) , to the value of lih / h of @xmath87 in the postrecombination epoch , from stancil et al .",
    "indeed , quantum mechanical computations now predict the rate coefficient for lih formation through radiative association to be 3 orders of magnitude smaller than previously thought from semi - classical methods ( dalgarno et al 1996 ) . in",
    "more evolved dense clouds , when three - body association reactions and formation of dust grains are taken into account , a significant fraction of all lithium could turn into molecules .",
    "it is therefore important to try to detect lih in a dense cloud , at high enough redshift that the line falls in an atmospheric window .",
    "this is the case for the absorbing cloud in the lensing galaxy in front of the b0218 + 357 quasar at a redshift of @xmath88 .",
    "the h@xmath11 column density is estimated to be n(h@xmath11)@xmath89 @xmath14 ( combes & wiklind 1997 ) . from a tentative detection",
    "( see figure 2 ) it was possible to deduce lih / li @xmath24 1.5 10@xmath90 .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the derived abundances are large , but the low lih / li ratio seems to exclude complete transformation of li into lih , as would be expected in very dense clouds ( e.g. stancil et al 1996 , although the li chemistry is not yet completely understood in dark clouds ) .",
    "however , it is likely that the cloud is clumpy , and in some of the more diffuse parts , lih is photodissociated ; some regions of the cloud could have a higher excitation temperature , in which case our computation under - estimates the lih abundance .",
    "the best candidates to determine the hubble constant via gravitational lenses , are quasars for which the multiple images are close together ; then the lens can be only a bulge of a spiral galaxy , quite simple to model ( contrary to widely separated images , where the lens is a cluster of galaxies ) .",
    "but then , the light rays pass close to the center of the lens galaxy , and absorption is likely to occur . among the four absorption systems detected in the mm ( cf table 2 ) , there are two cases of confirmed gravitational lenses , with two images ( the two other cases are likely to be internal absorption ) . for these systems",
    "( b0218 + 357 and pks1830 - 210 ) , the separation between the two images is among the smallest recorded : 0.3 and 1 arcsec respectively .",
    "this makes these two objects good candidates for the determination of the hubble constant , and the monitoring of the mm absorption can help to estimate the time - delay ( wiklind & combes 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "already , lovell et al ( 1998 ) determined a time delay of 26@xmath91 days in pks1830 - 210 from radio - cm observations .",
    "given the recently determined redshift of the quasar , of @xmath8 = 2.507 ( lidman",
    "et al 1999 , in prep ) , the derived hubble constant is 65@xmath92 km / s / mpc . in b0218 + 357 , biggs et al ( 1999 , in press ) were able to determine h@xmath93 = 69@xmath94 km / s / mpc .",
    "molecular lines in the millimeter domain are a tool to determine the background temperature , not because molecular clouds are usually very cold , with a kinetic temperature of the order of 10 - 20k , but mainly because the lines are excited by collisions with h@xmath11 . in diffuse regions , the collisional excitation is not enough , and the radiative excitation dominates .",
    "the excitation temperature of the molecules is then lower than the kinetic temperature , and close or equal to the background temperature @xmath95 .",
    "this is precisely the case of the gas absorbed in front of pks1830 - 211 , where @xmath96 for most of the molecules .",
    "the measurement of @xmath97 requires the detection of two nearby transitions . when the lower ones is optically thick , only an upper limit can be derived for @xmath97 .",
    "ideally , the two transitions should be optically thin , but then the higher one is very weak , and long integration times are required .",
    "the results obtained with the sest-15 m and iram-30 m on different molecules agree and are plotted as a single point in figure 3 .",
    "surprisingly , the bulk of measurements points towards an excitation temperature lower than the background temperature at @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath95= 5.20k .",
    "we suspect that this could be due to a variation of the total continuum flux , due to a micro - lensing event .",
    "at the present time , only objects at @xmath8 below 10 have been detected .",
    "the amount of star formation at higher redshifts will be negligible for the global balance of the universe , since the corresponding time is less than 3% of the hubble time ; however , it is of primordial importance to trace back the first stars formed , to understand star / galaxy formation processes just after recombination .",
    "would it be possible , with the future millimetric instruments , that will gain at least a factor 20 in sensitivity with respect to the present ones , to detect starbursts at even higher redshifts ?",
    "first , it will be easy to detect starbursts at @xmath99 5 without the help of gravitational lensing as today ( see figure 1 ) . beyond",
    ", since we do not know the nature of the objects , we can extrapolate their physical characteristics from the ultra - luminous fir sample detected at lower @xmath8 .",
    "as can be seen in table 1 , molecular masses range from 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath100 m@xmath10 , the dust temperature is high , about 30 - 50k ( up to 100k ) , and their size is strikingly small , below one kpc ( 300pc disks , solomon et al 1997 ) . in these conditions ,",
    "the average column density of h@xmath11 is 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , and the dust becomes optically thick at @xmath101 150@xmath5 m .",
    "two extreme simple models can be made about the corresponding molecular medium : either the gas is distributed in an homogeneous sphere , at a temperature of 50k , with a density of 10@xmath102 cm@xmath90 in average , or the gas is clumpy , distributed in cold dense clouds , with embedded hot cores .",
    "the expected flux coming from such starbursting regions in the various co lines , and the continuum flux from the dust emission , can then be derived as a function of redshift ( cf combes et al 1999 ) .",
    "the results of the two - component model , with kinetic temperatures 30 and 90 k at @xmath8 = 0 , and total gas mass 6 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 is plotted in figure 4 .",
    "this picture shows that , since the low-@xmath104 co lines are optically thick , their flux varies with the wavelength as @xmath105 at large @xmath106 in the millimeter range .",
    "this means that the co - lines detection will be less favoured at high redshift than the continuum emission .",
    "unfortunately , the increase of the cmb temperature t@xmath7 with redshift has not a significant effect on the detectability at high @xmath8 : if the excitation temperature of the gas is indeed increased , the background emission to subtract is also increased in the same proportions .",
    "it is already much more difficult to detect objects at @xmath31 than at @xmath32 , contrary to the dust emission .",
    "this conclusion is opposite to what was found by silk & spaans ( 1997 ) in their model .",
    "the most favourable wavelengths to detect the co lines are always longer than 1 mm ( assuming that the kinetic temperature of the gas is the same as the dust temperature ) . we can note that it is already possible to detect now in the continuum such huge starbursts at any redshifts ( up to 30 ) . with the upcoming future millimeter instruments , it will be possible to detect them also in the co lines , or detect much more modest starbursts in the continuum .    barger a.j . ,",

    "<S> it becomes possible now to detect cold molecules at high redshift in the millimeter domain . since the first discovery in 1992 by brown and van den bout of co lines at @xmath0 in a gravitationally lensed starburst galaxy , </S>",
    "<S> nearly ten objects are now known to possess large quantities of molecular gas beyond @xmath1 and up to @xmath2 , through millimeter and sub - millimeter emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> even more objects have been detected in their continuum dust emission , and a few galaxies through millimeter absorption lines in front of quasars at @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuum dust emission is the most easily detected : for a starburst dust at t@xmath4 60 k , the emission peaks around 60 @xmath5 m , and falls as @xmath6 at longer wavelengths . in the mm domain , </S>",
    "<S> the emission is then stronger for the more redshifted objects . for the co lines , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is less favorable , and the reported detections are helped by gravitational amplification . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the cmb temperature t@xmath7 with redshift helps the rotational line excitation ( especially at high @xmath8 ) , but not its detection .    </S>",
    "<S> absorption in front of quasars is a more sensitive probe of cold gas at high redshift , able to detect individual clouds of a few solar masses ( instead of 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 for emission ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of the small size of the qso , very high spatial resolution ( of the order of milli - arcsec ) can be achieved , and high spectral ( 30 m/s ) resolution , due to the heterodyne technique . the sampled column - densities range between n(h@xmath11)= 10@xmath12 et 10@xmath13 @xmath14 . the high sensitivity allows to detect a multitude of molecular lines in a single object ( hco@xmath15 , hnc , </S>",
    "<S> hcn , n@xmath11h@xmath15 , c@xmath16o , cs , h@xmath11co , cn , cch , h@xmath11s etc .... ) , and compare the chemistry with the local one , at @xmath8 = 0 . from the diffuse components </S>",
    "<S> , one can measure the cosmic black body temperature as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the high column densities component allow to observe important molecules not observable from the ground , like o@xmath11 , h@xmath11o and lih for example .    </S>",
    "<S> all these preliminary studies carry a great hope for what will be observed with future millimeter instruments , and some perspectives are given . </S>"
