    "many multi - physics problems , including fluid  structure interaction problems and multiphase flow problems , involve coupling between different physical systems through the interface , which separates two phases of matter , i.e. , solid , liquid , or gaseous . in the endeavor to solve such multi - physics problems ,",
    "one of the most challenging tasks is that of devising an accurate numerical discretization of the interface problems . in this paper , we consider the following elliptic interface problem : @xmath2 & = & g_n , & \\mbox { on } \\gamma,\\\\ \\left[u\\right]&=&\\boldsymbol{g_d } , & \\mbox { on } \\gamma,\\\\ u&=&0 , & \\mbox { on } \\partial\\omega . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the global regularity of the solution is low due to the nature of the interface . here , domain @xmath3 is a bounded and convex polygonal / polyhedral domain in @xmath4 or @xmath5 and an internal interface @xmath6 divides @xmath3 into two open sets , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is @xmath10-smooth ( see figure [ fig : domain ] for an illustration of a unit square that contains a circle as an interface ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath11 .",
    "the jump @xmath12 $ ] is defined in and , and the coefficient @xmath13 is bounded from below and above by some positive constants . due to the discontinuity of the coefficient @xmath13 , the standard numerical methods , which are efficient for smooth solutions , usually lead to a loss of accuracy across the interface .",
    "one way to render the more accurate approximation is to use interface - fitted / resolved grids .",
    "this way , the non - smoothness of the solution can be restricted to a `` narrow '' sub - domain in respect to the grid near the interface , such that the approximation error caused by the grid - mismatch is reduced to some extent . in @xcite ( see also @xcite for an english translation ) and more recently in @xcite , the following error estimate is obtained for @xmath14 : @xmath15 a sharper analysis is given in @xcite , wherein the logarithm factor of the above estimate is removed for @xmath14 .",

    "unfortunately , it is usually a nontrivial and time - consuming task to construct good interface - fitted meshes for problems involving geometrically complicated interfaces .",
    "when the problem is time - dependent , the domain needs to be re - meshed at each time step , which introduces an interpolation error between two consecutive meshes .",
    "therefore , numerous unfitted mesh methods , in which the interface is allowed to cross the elements , have been proposed in the literature . in the finite difference",
    "setting , we refer to the immersed boundary method in @xcite , the immersed interface method in @xcite , the ghost fluid method in @xcite , and the references therein . in the finite element framework",
    ", we refer to the work of @xcite for elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients in which finite element basis functions are locally modified for elements that intersect with the interface where the coefficient jumps . in @xcite , the adaptive immersed interface finite element method based on a posteriori error estimates",
    "is proposed for elliptic and maxwell equations with discontinuous coefficients .    in the past decade , a combination of the extended finite element method ( xfem ) ( sometimes also known as the unfitted finite element method ) with the nitsche scheme has become a popular discretization method .",
    "xfem was introduced in the context of crack formation in structure mechanics , and one of its benefits is the ability to model discontinuities independent of the mesh structure @xcite .",
    "the idea of xfem is to enrich the original finite element space by using specially designed basis functions that reflect the local features ( discontinuity , singularity , boundary layer , etc . ) of the problem .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for a historical account of xfem . inspired by the simple idea for handling dirichlet boundary conditions described in @xcite , hansbo @xcite applied nitsche s method to reformulate the problem in an xfe space .",
    "hansbo @xcite proved that this nitsche - xfem can achieve the optimal convergence rate for the linear element , thereby generalizing the results in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the nitsche - type weak boundary conditions are extended to a fictitious domain setting .",
    "a penalty term acting on the jumps of the gradients is added over the element faces , and optimal a priori error estimates are thereby derived for the linear element . in @xcite , an unfitted symmetric interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method for elliptic interface problems",
    "is considered , and optimal @xmath21-convergence for arbitrary @xmath22 is given for the two - dimensional case in the energy norm and in the @xmath1-norm . in @xcite , an unfitted @xmath23-interface penalty finite element method for elliptic interface problems is studied for both two and three dimensions .",
    "an extra flux penalty term is added to the bilinear forms .",
    "thus the stability could be proved by applying local trace and inverse inequalities on regular sub - elements . in @xcite ,",
    "the focus is a modified scheme for which the error estimates are independent of the contrast between diffusion coefficients . in @xcite ,",
    "a quadratic nitsche - xfem is studied for the interface problem , and a clear classification of the shape of interface intersecting elements is given .",
    "an overview of the ways in which nitsche s method has been applied to interface problems is given in @xcite .",
    "the nitsche - xfem can be interpreted as applying interior penalty ( ip ) methods on the interface , and techniques inspired by ip methods are used in @xcite . in this paper , we first extend ip - xfem to high - order xfe spaces , and then we consider another new dg - xfem for solving elliptic interface problems .",
    "we note that in our first approach , the penalization is applied only to the jump of the solution values across the interface ( compared with the bilinear form in @xcite ) , and the optimal @xmath21-convergence rate for arbitrary @xmath22 in the energy and @xmath24-norm are proved regardless of the dimension .",
    "the major and defining step in our variant is a delicate choice of the weight in the average ( see ) , which leads to an inverse estimate for possibly degenerated sub - elements ( see ) .",
    "whereas nitsche - type schemes are sometimes criticized for the inconvenient choice of stabilization parameters , we propose a second `` parameter - friendly '' scheme . in this scheme a penalization based on a lifting operator is introduced locally along the interface , and parameters need not be `` sufficiently large '' in regard to establishing the stability of the bilinear form .",
    "furthermore , we derive a generalized version of c ' ea s lemma ( see ) to retrieve the optimal convergence rate on high - order xfe spaces , even though the bilinear form is not bounded for functions in the continuous space in a normal sense",
    ". the main results of the analysis are summarized in theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thml2 ] .",
    "note that the trace and inverse inequalities such as are pivotal both in analyzing nitsche - type methods , and in deriving approximate penalty parameters to stabilize these schemes .",
    "they play an even more important role in the analysis of the unfitted mesh approach where the interface is allowed to intersect elements in an arbitrary manner . when sub - elements degenerate , which is not a rare case , the traditional technique by trace theorem and scaling argument is difficult to apply .",
    "the lowest version of is derived in @xcite , which utilized the fact that the gradient of the linear polynomial is constant .",
    "a similar inequality has been proved for possibly degenerated sub - elements in @xcite for two dimensions , whereas further justification is required for three dimensions . in section [ sec : aux ] , we prove the trace and inverse inequalities for polynomials of arbitrary order and for a general class of sub - elements , even though some of these may be very irregular in shape . the stability and the optimal convergence rate of the schemes are thus obtained .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give some preliminary results , which are used in subsequent sections , and then we introduce the xfe spaces and reformulate the interface problem in two types of dg schemes . in section [ sec : aux ] , we prove a special inequality  this is the key step in proving the stability of dg - xfem with arbitrary polynomial order for both the 2-@xmath25 and 3-@xmath25 interface problems .",
    "the @xmath26- and @xmath27- error estimates of both schemes  which attain the optimal order of the convergence rate in respect to mesh size @xmath21  are given in section [ sec : error ] .",
