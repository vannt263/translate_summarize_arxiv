    "massive stars with an initial mass greater than @xmath28  are expected to end their lives with the gravitational collapse of their degenerate core .",

    "these sne are characterised by the presence of strong hydrogen balmer lines in their optical spectra .",
    "their high - brightness phase , which also coincides with the photospheric phase , lasts about one hundred days .",
    "early simulations of such type ii sne ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggest a progenitor star with a massive and extended h - rich envelope , as typically found in red - supergiant ( rsg ) stars . the physics underlying the evolution of a sn ii - plateau ( ii - p ) has been extensively discussed by , for example , @xcite or more recently @xcite .",
    "the association between type ii - p sne and rsg stars has also been more directly made through the identification of the progenitor star on pre - explosion images ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "type ii sne exhibit a broad range in @xmath5-band absolute magnitude , spanning about 5 mag during the photospheric phase and the nebular phase @xcite .",
    "the latter suggests a range of @xmath610 in the mass of ni ejected .",
    "the ejecta expansion rate inferred from p - cygni profile widths halfway through the plateau also spans a range from 1000 to 8000   @xcite , suggestive of a large scatter in the ratio of ejecta kinetic energy @xmath7 and ejecta mass @xmath8 .",
    "more recent surveys document this diversity further @xcite , and also emphasize , for example , the range in photospheric phase durations , the @xmath4-band decline rate after maximum , how various radiative properties correlate .",
    "the existence of low - luminosity ( i.e. , intrinsically faint ) sne ii was well established in the 90s .",
    "sn1997d was one of the first type ii to exhibit abnormally narrow p - cygni profiles ( of the order of 1000 ) and a low optical brightness during the photospheric phase ( always fainter than @xmath914.65mag in the @xmath4-band ; @xcite ) , both suggestive of a low energy explosion in an extended h - rich star .",
    "the sample of low - luminosity type ii sne now includes a handful of objects @xcite , with an absolute @xmath4-band magnitude that covers from @xmath914 to @xmath915.5mag around 50d after explosion , thus 2@xmath93mag fainter than the prototypical type ii - p sn1999em @xcite .",
    "the fraction of low - luminosity sne could be @xmath25% of all type ii sne @xcite .",

    "constraints on the progenitor star and the ejecta ( explosion energy , ni mass ) are obtained through iteration until a good match to the bolometric light curve and the photospheric velocity evolution .",
    "@xcite modelled the low - luminosity sn2003z and obtained an ejecta mass of 14 , an ejecta kinetic energy of 2.45@xmath010@xmath1erg , 0.006  of ni , and a progenitor radius of 230 .",
    "@xcite used a similar approach and proposed progenitor masses in the range 1015  for the whole sample of low - luminosity sne ii .",
    "these results suggest that low - luminosity type ii sne are intrinsically under - energetic and synthesize little ni .",
    "other studies have argued that these low - luminosity type ii sne are the result of weak explosions in higher mass rsg stars . in this context , the low ni mass arises from the significant fallback of material onto the proto - neutron star , associated potentially with the subsequent formation of a black hole .",
    "@xcite propose this scenario with a 26  progenitor star for sn1997d @xcite , and argue against the possibility of a lower mass progenitor .",
    "later work by @xcite , using a semi - analytic modelling of the light curve , give support to the association with higher mass progenitors , in which the explosion is followed by fallback .",
    "the situation is therefore unsettled .",
    "for sn1997d , @xcite proposes a 14  progenitor , which disagrees with @xcite .",
    "for the low - luminosity sne ii - p 2005cs and 2008bk , a progenitor detection exists and suggests a low / moderate mass massive star ( in the range 913  on the zero - age main - sequence , zams ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even when an ejecta mass is inferred from light - curve modelling , estimating the corresponding progenitor mass on the main sequence is subject to error because of the uncertain mass loss history .",
    "furthermore , the light curve modelling above is primarily sensitive to the h - rich ejecta mass , not the total ejecta mass .",
    "the helium core mass can only be estimated by modelling nebular phase spectra and the helium core dynamics @xcite .    in this work , we model the low - luminosity sn2008bk because it is the best observed sn of this class of event , with a good photometric monitoring in the optical that started about a week after explosion @xcite .",
    "based on pre - explosion images and evidence of the disappearance of a source on post - explosion images , inferences have been made to constrain the nature of the progenitor star and its mass .",
    "the consensus is that it is a rsg star , although its inferred zams mass differs somewhat between studies , with 88.5  ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and 11.114.5  @xcite . in contrast , there has been little analysis of the sn spectroscopic and photometric data .",
    "a preliminary analysis is presented in @xcite , who proposes an ejecta with @xmath102.5@xmath010@xmath1erg , a total mass of 12 , and a ni mass of 0.009 , together with a progenitor radius of 550 , @xcite present an analysis of a nebular - phase spectrum at 547d after explosion and propose a progenitor star with a main - sequence mass of 12 .",
    "the simulations presented here are based on models of the progenitor evolution from the main - sequence until core collapse , together with the subsequent simulation of the piston - driven explosion including explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "the bulk of the work lies , however , in the non - local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( nlte ) time - dependent radiative - transfer modelling of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of sn2008bk .",

    "the overestimate of the velocity at maximum absorption by model x is in the same sense as for the luminosity ; our model x is slightly over - energetic for its mass and radius .",
    "the spectral morphology is markedly different from standard sne ii ; line profiles are narrower and suffer much less overlap with neighbouring features . at the end of the photospheric phase the h@xmath3 profile in sn2008bk shows a complex structure , which is absent in model x ( fig .",

    "this may be a signature of asphericity in the inner ejecta , which our 1-d approach can not capture .",

    "the expansion rate in model x is slightly larger than needed for sn2008bk ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_x_vabs ] ) , so the broader lines of the model tend to overestimate line overlap and erase the structure in the h@xmath3 region .",
    "we surmise that the complex appearance of the h@xmath3 region at the end of the photospheric phase in low - luminosity sne ii is due to ba6496.9 . in standard sne ii",
    "the higher expansion rate at the base of the h - rich envelope causes the contributions of ba6496.9  and h@xmath3 to merge into a single spectral feature .",
    "in addition to the influence of ba , interaction with the progenitor rsg wind ( ignored in our model ) may influence at such late times the h@xmath3 and h@xmath22 line profile morphology through the formation of a ` high - velocity ' absorption notch @xcite .",
    "it is however unclear whether the effect would apply for our model x since its low mass rsg progenitor should have a low wind mass loss rate .",
    "leaving aside the discrepancies associated with the neglect of ba , fig .",

    "the features around 90001@xmath23 m seen in the observations of sn2008bk at 35 and 55d are not predicted by our models  these are perhaps observational artefacts ( e.g. , second order contamination when using a dichroic ) .",

    "the colour shift discussed above is visible in the spectra at early times .",
    "the bluer spectrum of model xr2 at a given post - explosion epoch is suggestive of a higher photospheric temperature and ionisation .",
    "for example , the ca  near - ir triplet is hardly visible in model xr2 at 13.3d , but readily visible as a weak absorption feature in model x in which the transition to the recombination phase is more advanced . as apparent , a change of only 15% in the progenitor radius causes a significant difference in colours at early times ( this offset may be missed without the correct explosion time since a larger progenitor radius merely shifts the colour to later in time ) .",
    "the spectral offset between models x , xr1 , and xr2 is however smaller than obtained between the models mlt1 and mlt3 of @xcite , which resulted from the explosion of rsg stars with a much larger difference in surface radius ( 1100 and 500 , respectively ) .",
    "modulations in intrinsic colour may stem from diversity in progenitor radii , although in observations , such variations can also originate from reddening .    model x is brighter than sn2008bk by 0.5mag during the photospheric phase . given the results for models",
    "xr1 and xr2 , a reduction in radius by 15% would make it fainter by 0.2mag  this could arise from the adoption of a lower metallicity , like for model y. but a greater reduction would be needed to cancel the present offset and this would likely impact the colour . however , the colour of model x matches that of sn2008bk , and confirms the need for a rather compact rsg progenitor star , as advocated by @xcite for sne",

    "the light curve transition can be modulated by mixing of h and he . however , the properties of the highly bound slow - moving he - core material are hard to constrain from the light curve since the corresponding ejecta regions have a low / moderate optical depth at the end of the plateau phase .",
    "we now discuss mixing in order to test how our implementation affects our results .",
    "we use two approaches that are crude representations of the process of mixing as simulated in core - collapse sne @xcite . in the first approach , we step through each ejecta mass shell @xmath29 and mix all mass shells within the range [ @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath310.4",
    " this is the usual way we proceed @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that it is straightforward to implement .",
    "this mixing is carried out during the 1d  simulation , at 10,000s after the explosion was triggered ( and thus about one day before shock breakout ) .",
    "this mixing is both macroscopic ( material is shuffled in mass / velocity space ) and microscopic ( each 1-d / spherical mass shell on the  grid is homogeneous ) .",
    "this is the mixing done in models x , xr1 , xr2 , and xm .    in the second approach",
    "only ni is mixed ; all other species are essentially left as in the original  model except for hydrogen . in practice , after mixing ni , regions where the sum of mass fractions is below unity , hydrogen is added , while in regions where the sum of mass fractions is above unity ( typically by 1% ) , all species mass fractions are scaled so that the total is unity .",
    "this causes the spike in the h mass fraction in the innermost shells of models yn1 , yn2 , and yn3 because the ni mass fraction was close to unity in those layers prior to mixing ( fig .  [ fig_mix ] ) .",
    "this mixing approach is used in models yn1 , yn2 , and yn3 , which differ in the values of @xmath32 used . in this order ,",
    "we have used @xmath310.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 .",
    "we show the composition for a selection of species in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig_mix ] .",
    "this exercise is instructive because our various models all derive from a 12  main sequence star , with similar h - rich envelope and he - core properties . yet",
    ", these different levels of mixing produce drastic variations at nebular times , as we discuss now .",
    "the middle - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_mix ] shows the bolometric luminosity for models x and yn1/yn2/yn3 . during the photospheric phase ,",
    "the early - time luminosity is higher in model x because of the large progenitor radius ( 502 compared to 405 ) and the higher ratio @xmath27 .",
    "the lower ejecta mass of model x ( 8.29 compared to 9.45 ) produces a shorter plateau length by 20d ( all four models have the same ejecta kinetic energy of @xmath33erg ) .",
    "interestingly , the three models yn1/yn2/yn3 show a similar bump at the end of the plateau phase , despite their different levels of ni mixing . model x , which has a similar level of ni mixing as model yn1 , does not show a bump .",
    "this bump is controlled by the mixing of other species , and in particular how h and he are mixed in velocity / mass space at the he - core edge ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in model",
    "x , all species are mixed and this tends to soften the changes in composition in the inner ejecta , which the photosphere probes at the end of the plateau phase .",
    "h is important here because it is the main electron donor so that different levels of h mixing can modulate the evolution of the optical depth at the end of the plateau phase ( and modulate the recession of the photosphere and the variation in luminosity ) .",
    "the middle - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_mix ] shows the evolution of the @xmath24 colour for the four models .",
    "the more extended model x is bluer during the photospheric phase , but redder at nebular epochs .",
    "model yn3 with the strongest mixing is the redder of all four models during the photospheric phase ",
    "the extra heating does not compensate for the increased opacity from metals , but it is the bluer of all models at nebular times .",
    "the drastic change is seen when the models transition to the nebular phase .",
    "model x becomes exceedingly red , while models yn1 , yn2 , and yn3 remain systematically bluer , the more so the larger the mixing of ni",
    ".    the broad - band fluxes of type ii sne do not depend on the temperature in the same way at nebular times as during the photospheric phase , when the escaping radiation has roughly the properties of a blackbody . at nebular times",
    ", the sn radiates the energy deposited by radioactive decay through strong emission lines , many of which being forbidden . here ,",
    "temperature and ionisation of the gas control which lines cool the ejecta .",
    "then , depending on the location of these transitions in wavelength space , one can produce different colours , even if the bolometric luminosity ( which is set by the amount of decay energy absorbed by the gas ) is the same between models .    in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig_mix ] , we show a comparison of model x ( left ) and model yn3 ( right ) with the observations of sn2008bk at 282d after explosion ( the models and observations have been normalised at 6310  to better reveal the relative offsets in flux ) .",
    "model x follows roughly the observed spectral energy distribution , but it underestimates the flux in the 5000  region and overestimates it in the red part of the optical .",
    "model x has cooler and more recombined h - rich shells ( e.g. , with dominance of fe ) than model yn3 ( with dominance of fe ) .",
    "more importantly , it strongly overestimates the ca7300  doublet and underestimates the strength of h@xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , model yn3 , which has the same amount of ni and a similar core composition as model x , has a completely different nebular spectrum .",
    "model yn3 matches well the ca7300  doublet and the ca8500  triplet and overestimates the strength of h@xmath3 by about a factor of two ( model yn1 , characterised by a weaker ni mixing , slightly underestimates the strength of h@xmath3 ) . the half - width - at - half - maximum is @xmath2500  for h@xmath3 ( this velocity corresponds to the innermost h - rich layers in the ejecta ) and is about 350  for the ca7300  doublet ( this velocity corresponds to the he - rich ejecta regions ) . in both cases ,",
    "the line forms over a range of velocities . for h@xmath3 , model yn3 strongly overestimates the extent of the absorption trough  model yn1 with a weaker ni mixing has a narrower trough that matches closer the observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig_yn_line ] ) .",
    "the different levels of mixing affect the h@xmath3 widths , but not ca7300   the ni mixing affects more the ionisation of h  than that of cain the outer ejecta .",
    "this short exploration on mixing highlights the complications it introduces even for ejecta that have the same overall composition , mass , and energetics .",
    "how the different elements are distributed at both the microscopic and macroscopic level is a fundamental aspect of the problem @xcite , and it depends both on the composition prior to explosion as well on the impact of the explosion on this distribution .",
    "we will come back to the issue of mixing for nebular phase spectra in a future study .",
    "we have presented the results of numerical simulations that aim at understanding the properties of the ejecta / radiation associated with sn2008bk , as well as the progenitor star at its origin .",
    "we have focused on a single mass of 12  for the progenitor , and have evolved this model with  at solar metallicity but with different parameterisations for mass loss and convection in order to produce rsg stars at death that cover a range of final masses and surface radii .",
    "these models were then exploded with the radiation hydrodynamics code 1d  to produce ejecta with various explosion energies and ni mass .",
    "finally , starting at a post - explosion time of 10d , we have evolved these ejecta with the nlte radiative transfer code , building multi - band light curves and multi - epoch spectra that can be directly compared to observations .",
    "our model x , which closely matches sn2008bk , corresponds to a star with an initial mass of 12 , a final mass of 9.88 , an h - rich envelope mass of 6.7 a final surface radius of 502 .",
    "the associated ejecta has a mass of 8.29 , a kinetic energy of 2.5@xmath010@xmath1erg and 0.0086  of ni .",
    "provided we introduce a 0.5mag offset , model x follows closely the multi - band optical and near - ir light curves of sn2008bk , including the colour evolution ( e.g. , the sharp drop in the @xmath34 band and the near - constant evolution of the @xmath35band magnitude ) and the plateau duration .",
    "model x reproduces well the spectral evolution of sn2008bk ( provided we renormalise the spectra to cancel the 0.5mag offset in brightness ) , the progressive reddening of the spectra as the photospheric temperature drops and line blanketing strengthens , the reduction in line widths as the photosphere recedes to deeper / slower ejecta layers .",
    "the early colour evolution and reddening of the spectra is best matched with an explosion date of mjd54546.0 .",
    "we find that model x yields lines that are 10 - 20% too broad  it typically overestimates the expansion rate by 1020% .",
    "our model x is therefore somewhat too energetic for sn2008bk .",
    "a lower explosion energy could reduce the offset in line widths and brightness .",
    "the offset in luminosity could be reduced by invoking a larger reddening ( perhaps up to @xmath110.1mag ) to sn2008bk .",
    "the uncertainty in the cepheid - based distance to the host of sn2008bk is probably small . given all the uncertainties involved , these offsets are reasonably small to suggest that model x is a sensible representation of sn2008bk .    our model of sn2008bk is a low - energy counterpart of the models for  standard \" sne ii - p like 1999em .",
    "the mechanisms that control their evolution are the same for both  in our approach we merely reduce the energy injection to produce a model for sn2008bk rather than one for sn1999em .",
    "however , the lower expansion rate in sn2008bk allows a much better inspection of the line profile fits .",
    "interestingly , in low - luminosity sne ii , the h@xmath3 line systematically develops a complex structure at the end of the plateau phase .",
    "this structure is most likely not a signature of asymmetry , but instead caused by overlap with the strong ba6496.9  line .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the good match obtained to the isolated line of ba6141.7  in sn2008bk .",
    "we have performed additional models to gauge the sensitivity of our results to changes in progenitor / explosion parameters .",
    "a 15% increase in the progenitor surface radius leads to a @xmath215% increase in plateau luminosity and a 0.2mag brightening of the @xmath4-band magnitude , but does not affect the length of the photospheric phase .",
    "an increase in ejecta mass of 1  hardly affects the results for model x , except for the lengthening of the photospheric phase by 10.0d .    in our simplistic approach",
    ", chemical mixing has little impact on the sn radiation throughout most of the plateau phase .",
    "early on , increased mixing causes extra line blanketing and produces redder optical colours . in our models where only ni is mixed outwards ( but no mixing is applied to h and he ) ,",
    "the light curve develops a 15-d long ledge before dropping from the plateau .",
    "mixing of h with he smoothes that transition , most likely because it allows a much smoother evolution of the electron - scattering optical depth , which controls the release of radiative energy stored in the ejecta ( and the rate of recession of the photosphere ) .",
    "however , the most drastic impact of mixing in our models is seen at the nebular times .",
    "depending on how we perform the mixing , we can completely quench h@xmath3 , boost ca7300 , or mitigate the temperature and ionisation state of the gas to alter the sn colours .",
    "because of all these complications , we defer the modelling of the nebular - phase spectra of sn2008bk .",

    "<S> an increase in ejecta mass by 10% lengthens the plateau by @xmath210d . </S>",
    "<S> chemical mixing introduces slight changes to the bolometric light curve , limited to the end of the plateau , but has a large impact on colours and spectra at nebular times .    </S>",
