    "but it will be argued here that _",
    "uncertainty relations exist precisely because waves diffract_. as in figure  4 , at the origin , the dipole field is basically concentrated in one point , so @xmath73 , but the streamline directions carrying the field s momentum @xmath74 point in an infinite number of directions , hence @xmath75 . very far from the origin , the streamlines are basically parallel to the @xmath17 axis and @xmath76 , but the wavefront has spread very widely and @xmath77 . at intermediate points",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 can be mathematically related in several ways .",

    "what are the quantum implications of such a field , particularly the cut - off angle @xmath99 ? the probability amplitude can be directly related to the curvature of @xmath2 : increasing the curvature increases the angle of incidence of @xmath2 on @xmath98 , and hence the smaller the @xmath89 vector",

    "according to the analysis above , an electromagnetic - relativistic - quantum - mechanical equivalence principle can now be generalized as follows : `` in the field surrounding a system of electromagnetic charges , the gravitational field is equivalent to the curvature of the diffracting streamlines , while the local quantum mechanical state is equivalent to the gradient of the potential .
