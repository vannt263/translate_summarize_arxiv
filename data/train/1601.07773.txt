    "since the experimental realisation of graphene,@xcite a lot of research has been done in order to understand its remarkable electronic structure and transport properties .",
    "notably , charge carriers in graphene were shown , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite to behave like ultra - relativistic particles which lead to the introduction of the concept of pseudospin and the observation of klein tunneling.@xcite it is also remarkable that when multiple graphene sheets are stacked the low - energy electronic structure completely changes , despite the very weak van der waals coupling between the graphene sheets .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the stacked multilayer structures still have a high symmetry and results in very different transport properties such as anti - klein tunneling for bilayer graphene@xcite and even more remarkable phenomena for multilayers.@xcite    an in - plane magnetic field has no influence on the energy - momentum relation of monolayer graphene but it does alter the electronic properties of multilayer and specifically bilayer graphene.@xcite in contrast to a perpendicular magnetic field , for which the influence on the transport properties of both monolayer@xcite and bilayer@xcite graphene has been investigated in much detail , an in - plane magnetic field breaks the equivalence of the two layers of bilayer graphene and as such decouples them at low energy .    in this work",
    "we investigate how an in - plane magnetic field influences the electronic and transport properties of electrons in bilayer graphene that tunnel through potential steps and barriers .",
    "we show that the results can be explained by using the chiral properties of the charge carriers.@xcite the crucial effect of an in - plane magnetic field is that it changes the parabolic low - energy spectrum of bilayer graphene into two linear dirac cones each corresponding to one of the two graphene layers.@xcite for magnetic fields oriented parallel to the potential boundaries this leads to an additional propagating mode that strongly affects the tunneling properties by increasing the conductance and introducing klein tunneling at normal incidence and at strong enough magnetic fields , reminiscent of the linear electron dispersion .",
    "further , we find that the transmission resonances that are due to confinement in the barrier are morphed into anti - resonances at large magnetic fields .",
    "these features are visible in the conductance of the system and in this way we provide a relation between empirically verifiable quantities as the conductance,@xcite fermi level and the magnetic field . for magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to the potential boundaries",
    "the splitting into dirac cones leads to a transition from a bilayer system to two separated monolayer - like systems with klein tunneling emerging at certain incident angles symmetric around 0 , a feature which can also be seen in the conductance .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field used in this paper is very large and although these fields can not be created in terrestrial laboratories , we show that they can be achieved by means of shifting the two graphene planes with respect to each other .",
    "following a similar reasoning as for monolayer graphene@xcite in this way one creates an in - plane pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "we are aware of two articles which study similar systems .",
    "however , the first paper@xcite only focuses on one orientation of the magnetic field and the second paper@xcite only focuses on the case in which the fermi energy equals the height of the potential barrier .",
    "furthermore , both papers were limited to transport governed by a single transmission channel .",
    "our findings match these results in the respective limits but we extend them by taking into account all the different transmission and reflection channels for a range of both fermi energy and incident angle values and for two fundamentally different orientations of the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "this is important since it shows new results .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the conductance which also is a new and important result because it shows the experimentally observable signatures of the new physics",

    "bilayer graphene consists of two stacked hexagonal monolayers which in turn are made of two trigonal sublattices .",

    "therefore , one can identify the two branches of the low - energy spectrum with the orthonormal pseudospin - up and pseudospin - down eigenstates , respectively .",
    "this identification is shown as the red and blue bands in figs .",
    "[ fig : energie](d ) and ( f ) .",

    "furthermore , the influence of the skew hopping parameters on the transport properties of bilayer graphene was already shown to be negligible@xcite and because of their relatively small importance but large computational cost they will also be neglected in this work .",
    "fig .

    "because the above formula shows that the low - energy spectrum of a graphene bilayer where one layer is shifted over a distance @xmath55 in the armchair direction corresponds to that of an in - plane magnetic field in the armchair direction , the magnetic field @xmath2 from eq .",

    "the energy spectrum for the case of the in - plane magnetic field is simpler and can therefore be used as a theoretical approximation to determine the tunneling properties of shifted bilayer graphene .",

    "[ fig : energie](f ) .",

    "this also explains why @xmath145 in this zone .    in zone 4",
    "all the modes outside the potential are propagating while all the modes inside the potential are not .",

    "the only propagating mode in zone 5 is the @xmath78-mode which is why @xmath146 in this zone while all the other scattering probabilities either vanish or are undefined .    finally , in zone 6 the @xmath78- and @xmath87-modes are propagating while their @xmath79- and @xmath88-counterparts are not",
    "this explains why @xmath143 and @xmath147 vanish while @xmath148 and @xmath149 are finite .",
    "however , because the energy of the electrons is much larger than the height of the potential step , the transmission is nearly unity while the reflection is almost zero .",

    "the reflection probabilities are similar to those for the case of scattering on a potential step since the situation at the left side of the potential has not changed .",
    "in contrast , the transmission probabilities differ significantly from those for the potential step .    fig .",
    "[ fig : gridbar ] shows that the transmission probabilities for which the propagating mode is the same at the left and right side of the barrier are dominant over the transmission probabilities for which the propagating mode is altered .",
    "for example , while the @xmath151 channel for low - energy is significant for the potential step , for the barrier it is almost completely suppressed to the advantage of the @xmath144 channel in the same energy range .",
    "a similar probability transfer has occurred between the @xmath148 and @xmath143 channels in the lower part of zone 3 .",
    "the reason for this probability transfer is that a possible way of transiting the barrier region in the same mode is by switching modes when entering and leaving the barrier , i.e. @xmath152 . fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] shows that in the case of the potential step , the transmission probabilities @xmath153 dominate over the probabilities @xmath154 for @xmath95 .",
    "thus in the case of the potential barrier , for @xmath95 the transmission probabilities @xmath154 will dominate because the electron is likely to change its propagating mode at both edges of the potential .",
    "the reason that @xmath148 is dominant for @xmath97 in the case of the potential barrier is because @xmath148 is also dominant for @xmath97 in the case of the potential step and thus a @xmath78 electron can go through the barrier by staying in the same mode .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : gridbar ] that now not only @xmath150 , but also @xmath155 .",
    "the reason is similar to the argument used for the case of the potential step.@xcite    a remarkable feature of the transmission probability @xmath148 is that in a range around @xmath156 and @xmath47 there is a non vanishing transmission probability despite the fact that there are no propagating modes inside the barrier .",
    "this finite transmission stems from evanescent tunneling through the finite barrier , a process which is impossible for the step since it is infinitely wide .",
    "furthermore , the results are again in agreement with the predictions made in sec .",
    "[ sec : current density and scattering probabilities ] based on the conservation of pseudospin , keeping in mind that the predictions for @xmath95 are not valid for the barrier and that the predictions for @xmath97 can be extended to the entire positive energy domain since the electron will always end up in a positive energy solution at the right side of the barrier .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the potential step for which the electron will end up in a negative energy solution in the step for @xmath95 .",
    "[ fig : gridbar ] shows that the transmission probability @xmath148 carries most of the tunneling features present in the system .",

    "this happens in the region corresponding to zone 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : biparschematisch](b ) and is to be expected as in this zone the energy spectrum can both inside and outside the potential barrier be considered to be that of two separate linear dirac cones .",
    "the requirement that the black and white dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmmevolutie ] have the same value for @xmath47 immediately yields the minimal magnetic field at which chiral supported tunneling for @xmath95 can be observed in this system , which is given by @xmath158 which yields @xmath159 t for @xmath160 .",
    "note however that at these large magnetic fields also the high energy transmission is affected . from @xmath161 t and beyond",
    "there is a set of anti - resonances appearing in zone 3 .",

    "the conductance has different characteristics as a function of the magnetic field for energies @xmath95 .",
    "the typical bilayer resonances are shifted to higher energy values until they vanish and eventually morph into anti - resonances .",

    "the conductance calculation shows the remarkable fact that the resonances in the conductance morph into anti - resonances , implying that they stem from the same physical process and that the resonances in the transmission probability morph into anti - resonances as well .",
    "these results are characteristic experimental features and are a direct consequence of the in - plane ( pseudo-)magnetic field .",
    "when the thickness of the barrier increases , more resonances and anti - resonances will appear . in the limit of an infinitely thick potential barrier , i.e. a potential step , all the resonances will merge to form the region of enhanced conductance around @xmath171 and all the anti - resonances will merge to form the region of zero conductance around @xmath156 .    for a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the potential boundaries , the conductance at first increases as the magnetic field increases for a given energy but then decreases for even larger magnetic fields . the initial increase in the conductance",
    "is due to the splitting of the bilayer system into two monolayer - like systems .",
    "however , as the magnetic field increases even further the two monolayer - like transmission regions separate further as well .",
    "as the transmission probability for @xmath80 values in between these two regions vanishes this leads to a decrease in the conductance .",
    "furthermore , for the case of the potential barrier the resonances for @xmath95 now move to lower energies as the magnetic field increases , as opposed to the case of a magnetic field oriented parallel to the potential boundaries where the resonances move to higher energies before morphing into anti - resonances .",
    "there are now also distinct resonances visible for @xmath97 .",
    "by shifting one of the two layers of the bilayer system , the energy spectrum becomes similar to the spectrum of bilayer graphene in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "therefore the shift has the same effect as an in - plane pseudo - magnetic field that can reach extreme high values .",
    "the scattering of electrons on a potential step and barrier in bilayer graphene was studied in the presence of such large in - plane magnetic fields oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the potential boundaries and it was linked with the concept of pseudospin .    for a magnetic field",
    "oriented parallel to the potential boundaries , the different scattering probabilities were shown to be drastically altered by the presence of the magnetic field as a consequence of an extra propagating mode at low energies .",
    "the results for electrons at normal incidence were explained by conservation of pseudospin and the results in general can be understood by dividing the @xmath107 plane in different zones in which electronic transport is governed by different propagating modes . at large magnetic fields , we have further shown that due to the splitting of the parabolic cone into two linear ones , the chiral suppressed transmission is transformed into a chiral supported transmission at normal incidence .",
    "for both a potential step and a potential barrier the conductance decreases as a function of the strength of the parallel magnetic field for energies @xmath97 . for electrons with energy @xmath95 the conductance",
    "is enhanced in the regions where additional propagating modes are available .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a potential barrier a parallel magnetic field shifts the tunneling resonances to higher energies and eventually morphs them into anti - resonances . this can be clearly seen in the conductance of the system .    for a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the potential boundaries",
    ", we found a very clear transition from a bilayer system to two separated monolayer - like systems .",
    "this transition is clearly shown in the shifting of the bilayer graphene high - transmission regions at @xmath95 which leads to the occurrence of klein tunneling at @xmath162 for the case of the potential step .",
