    "one of the unsolved problems in the physics of hadron spectroscopy is the negative - parity baryon .",
    "experimentally , negative - parity baryons in hyperon channels have not been sufficiently studied .",
    "there are little data in the @xmath5 channel and spin - parity quantum numbers of many resonances are not determined in the @xmath7 and @xmath1 channels  @xcite . theoretically , chiral symmetry is a key issue in qcd together with confinement and therefore it is important to understand how it manifests itself in the baryon sector . positive and",
    "negative - parity baryons have different masses in the broken ( goldstone ) phase of chiral symmetry while they should be degenerate in the unbroken ( wigner ) phase .",
    "thus , mass differences of positive and negative - parity baryons should be understood as a consequence of the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry . however ,",
    "this has not been achieved yet . in constituent quark models ,",
    "negative - parity baryons are usually regarded as states in which one of three constituent quarks is excited to a p - wave orbit , and the relation to the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry is unclear  @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd , which is the most legitimate nonperturbative method , has difficulties in applying to negative - parity baryons because the negative - parity baryon is located in the continuum of the positive - parity baryon and the meson  @xcite . in the qcd sum rule approach , the properties of hadrons , such as the mass or the decay constant ,",
    "are related to the vacuum condensates , i.e. vacuum expectation values of quark - gluon composite operators  @xcite . since the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry",
    "is associated with condensates of chiral - odd operators , the method of the qcd sum rule seems very suitable for the purpose of understanding the parity splitting of baryons from the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "though the method of the qcd sum has the same difficulty as does the lattice qcd , there have been some attempts to overcome the difficulty and apply the method to negative - parity baryons . still , their sum rules are not very satisfactory in a sense that they do not have a sufficient borel stability .",
    "recently , we proposed a new approach of the qcd sum rule for the baryon in which positive- and negative - parity baryons couple with each other  @xcite .",
    "then , we applied the method to the nucleon channel and investigated the parity splitting of the nucleon .",
    "we found that the borel stability of the sum rule has been drastically improved not only for the positive - parity nucleon but also for the negative - parity nucleon .",
    "the obtained results showed that the parity splitting of baryons can be studied in the framework of the qcd sum rule once the coupling of positive- and negative - parity states is appropriately taken into account .",
    "the following point , however , remained unclarified in the previous work  @xcite .",
    "for the positive - parity nucleon we found a sum rule with an energy region in which the operator product expansion ( ope ) reasonably converges and contribution from the continuum is smaller than the pole contribution , while such a sum rule can not be found for the negative - parity nucleon .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "our first aim is to reexamine the nucleon channel in the coupled qcd sum rule more carefully .",
    "we would like to see if it is really impossible to construct sum rules for the negative - parity nucleon which has convergence of the ope and dominance of the pole over the continuum .",
    "our second aim is to apply the method of the coupled qcd sum rules to the hyperon channels and investigate the parity splitting of the hyperons .",
    "we would like to see which observed states are the parity partners of the lowest positive - parity hyperons and also study the effect of the su(3 ) breaking on negative - parity baryons .",
    "there is a well - known problem in the negative - parity hyperon , the problem of the @xmath4 . in the @xmath0 channel",
    "the lowest negative - parity state is the @xmath4 .",
    "however , many theoretical calculations have failed to reproduce its mass .",
    "this may imply that the parity partner of the @xmath0 is not the @xmath4 but a higher resonance .",
    "in fact , the idea has been proposed that @xmath4 is not a flavor - octet state or not even a simple three - quark state .",
    "we would like to clarify if the sum rules conclude that the @xmath8 can be regarded as the parity partner of the @xmath0 or not .",

    "we determine the phenomenological parameters from the condition that they are least sensitive to the borel weight .",
    "namely , we search for the effective continuum thresholds , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the mixing parameter , @xmath49 , for which the obtained baryon masses with two choices of the borel weight , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , become as close to each other as possible and the borel curves for baryon masses have most stable plateaus .",

    ", the borel stability appears within the range of @xmath64  gev with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the obtained baryon masses are roughly the same , as we will show .",
    "it should be noted that for the sum rule to be reliable the ope must converge and the pole contribution must dominate over the continuum contribution , which can be realized in a restricted range of the borel mass if at all possible . from here on , we call the energy region a borel window , which satisfies that in the ope the contribution of the highest order included terms is less than 10 % of the total sum and that the continuum contribution is less than the pole contribution . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we made an optimal choice of the parameters only from the condition that the sum rule for the positive - parity nucleon has a borel window .",
    "then , the sum rule for the negative - parity nucleon had no borel window because of its large continuum contribution .",
    "the absence of the borel window for the negative - parity baryon seemed natural since the negative - parity nucleon is above the positive - parity continuum threshold .",
    "surprisingly , by reexamining the sum rules carefully , we have found sum rules with a borel window for not only positive but also negative - parity baryons , which we will show in the following .",
    "we first study the sum rules for the nucleon channel in detail .",
    "figures  [ figi ] and [ figii ] show the borel curves for the masses of positive- and negative - parity nucleons with @xmath62 and @xmath65 , respectively , which also include the curves without continuum contribution for comparison .",
    "the curve without continuum contribution , however , is not shown for the negative - parity nucleon in fig .",
    "[ figii ] , because it is outside the range of the figure . on the one hand",
    ", one sees from fig .",
    "[ figi ] that the continuum contributes less than 50% to the positive - parity ( negaive - parity ) mass when the borel mass is below @xmath66 @xmath67  gev and @xmath62 .",
    "simiarly , from fig .",
    "[ figii ] the continuum contribution in the positive - parity ( negative - parity ) mass is less than 50% when the borel mass is below @xmath68 ( @xmath69 )  gev and @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    ", we checked that the highest - order terms , dimension - six terms , in the ope contribute to the nucleon mass less than 10% both in the positive- and negative - parity channels when the borel mass is above 0.8  gev .",
    "moreover , the borel curve has a perfectly stable plateau for the positive - parity nucleon mass in fig .",
    "[ figii ] and a reasonably stable plateau for the negative - parity nucleon mass in fig .",
    "[ figi ] in the range of @xmath70  gev . from the values of the plateaus",
    "we obtain the results of the sum rules for the masses of the positive- and negative - parity nucleons as @xmath71 these values reproduce the experimental masses , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , within 5% .",
    "we next move on to the hyperon channels . concerning the stability of the sum",
    "rules the hyperon channels have tendencies similar to the nucleon channel .",
    "namely , the borel weight @xmath65 ( @xmath62 ) gives the most stable sum rule for the positive - parity ( negative - parity ) hyperons .",
    "figures  [ figiii ] and [ figiv ] show the borel curves for the masses of positive- and negative - parity flavor - octet baryons , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ figiii ] one sees that the borel curves calculated by eq .",
    "( [ srtwo ] ) with @xmath65 are fairly stable in the whole range of the figure .",
    "these curves turn out to have roughly the same borel window , @xmath74  gev . from the values in the borel window",
    "we obtain @xmath75 these values reproduce the experimental masses , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , fairly well . from the sum rule for the masses of negative - parity baryons , eq .",
    "( [ srtwo ] ) with @xmath62 , we find that the borel window is about @xmath79  gev . in fig .",
    "[ figiv ] one sees that the borel curves are stable in the region of @xmath80  gev .",
    "taking the values in the region of @xmath81  gev we obtain @xmath82 the obtained values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are close to the breit - wigner masses of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the results of the sum rules suggest that the parity partner of the @xmath0 should be assigned to the @xmath2 and that of the @xmath1 to the @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 can not be regarded as the parity partner of the @xmath85 and may be a flavor - singlet or exotic state .",
    "an interesting point to mention is the ordering of the negative - parity @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
    "if one accepts the above assignment , the parity partner of the @xmath0 , the @xmath2 , is a little heavier than that of the @xmath1 , the @xmath3 .",
    "though @xmath0 and @xmath1 are almost degenerate in the sum rule as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figiv ] , the sum rule predicts that the @xmath0 is slightly heavier than @xmath1 .",
    "this ordering seems rather robust in the sum rule .",
    "the fact that the su(3 ) breaking effect shows up oppositely in the positive- and negative - parity states is an interesting point to be investigated further .    in the @xmath5 channel , there exist too little experimental data to conclusively assign an observed state to the parity partner of @xmath5 . among the observed states , the mass of the @xmath6  @xcite is the closest to our predicted value , 1.8 gev .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 can be a candidate of the parity partner , though its spin and parity are not observed yet .",
    "however , there is another possibility that the parity partner of the @xmath5 is not yet found because the observation of the @xmath5 channel is relatively poor due to the experimental difficulty in the production of the particles with strangeness @xmath86 .",
    "recently , there has appeared an interesting lattice qcd calculation  @xcite for the negative - parity hyperon .",
    "the predicted mass , @xmath87 , is 1.8  gev with the statistical errors less than 0.1  gev , which is close to the result of the present work .",
    "this result seems to support our conjecture that the parity partner of the @xmath5 exists around 1.8  gev , although one should expect large systematic errors in the lattice calculation .",
    "finally , we examine how the errors of qcd parameters propagate to the results of sum rules .",
    "the significant sources of uncertainties are the errors of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , both of which are about 40 % , while the error of @xmath55 causes rather minor modification in the results  @xcite . in the nucleon channel , varying the @xmath88 ( @xmath90 ) between this range , we find that the positive - parity masses change from 0.88 to 1.03  gev ( 0.9 to 1.02  gev ) and the negative - parity from 1.44 to 1.54  gev ( 1.45 to 1.56  gev ) . in the hyperon channel",
    "the errors of these parameters change the masses by @xmath91  gev on average .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are about 30% , 10% and 40%  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these errors change the hyperon masses by @xmath95  gev on average .",
    "the total uncertainties of the predicted masses are roughly 10% .",
    "we have applied the method of the qcd sum rule , in which positive- and negative - parity baryons couple with each other , to the flavor - octet hyperons and investigated the parity splittings .",
    "we have also reexamined the nucleon in the method , which was studied in our previous paper  @xcite . by carefully choosing the borel weight",
    "we have obtained sum rules , which have very good borel stability and also have a borel window , an energy region in which the ope converges and the pole contribution dominates over the continuum contribution for the positive- and negative - parity nucleon and hyperons . in the @xmath96 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , the predicted masses of the positive- and negative - parity baryons reproduce the experimental ones fairly well .",
    "the parity partners of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assigned to the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this means that the @xmath4 state is not the party partner of the @xmath0 and may be a flavor - singlet or exotic state . in the @xmath5 channel , there are too little experimental data to conclusively assign an observed state to the parity partner and we pointed out two possibilities .",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath6  @xcite is the parity partner of the @xmath5 , whose mass is closest to our predicted value , 1.8 gev , among the observed states of the @xmath5 channel though the spin and parity are not determined yet .",
    "another possibility is that the parity partner of the @xmath5 is not yet found because the observation of the @xmath5 channel is relatively poor due to the experimental difficulty in the production of the particles with strangeness @xmath86 . in the latter case",
    "the sum rule predicts the parity partner of the @xmath5 exists around 1.8 gev .",
    "this seems to be supported by a recent lattice qcd calculation  @xcite , which also predicts that @xmath87 is 1.8  gev with a statistical error of about 0.1 gev , though one should keep in mind large systematic errors should be taken into account .    in this paper",
    "the @xmath4 is not assigned to the parity partner of @xmath0 . in order to understand",
    "the structure of the @xmath4 many works have already appeared . in the nonrelativistic quark model  @xcite the @xmath4",
    "is interpreted as the flavor - singlet negative - parity three - quark state . on the contrary , according to the lattice qcd calculation  @xcite it is difficult to identify the @xmath4 to be the flavor - singlet three - quark state .",
    "there is another interesting indication that the operators consisting of the four quarks and one antiquark play an important role in the qcd sum rule approach  @xcite .",
    "we will report on the @xmath4 as well as the flavor - singlet three - quark state in the present approach elsewhere .    #",
