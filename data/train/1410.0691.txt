    "the initial bicep2 high - sensitivity measurements of b - mode polarization in the microwave sky on large angular scales ( @xmath4 ) have generated a great deal of excitement @xcite .",
    "this result was originally seen as a clear detection of primordial b - modes , which can be interpreted as the imprint of gravitational radiation from the epoch of inflation ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite , for a review of different models ) .",
    "these potential primordial b - modes could also be interpreted as the signature of alternatives to inflation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or as the signature of topological defects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent work has shown the strong possibility that the bicep2 signal can be explained by galactic dust ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the excess b - modes seen by bicep2 have been confirmed by deeper measurements from the _ keck array _",
    "@xcite over the same patch of sky , a joint analysis of the bicep2 , _ keck array _ and _ planck _ maps finds that the significance of the residual signal after subtraction of the galactic dust emission is too low to constitute a robust detection of primordial b - modes @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the bicep2 signal is due entirely to dust or has a significant primordial contribution .",
    "if the signal really is primordial , it would be interesting to measure the scale dependence of these tensor fluctuations ( henceforth called `` tensor tilt '' ) using future polarization measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : pspec ] shows the effect of varying the tensor tilt @xmath0 on the theoretical power spectrum of the primordial b modes for a fixed value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath3 power spectra have been normalized at @xmath6 , an angular scale well probed by the bicep2 experiment , although for the results presented in section [ sec : results ] the pivot scale at which @xmath5 is taken will be held to @xmath7 .",
    "this choice of pivot scale affects the quoted values of @xmath5 but not the r - marginalized constraints on @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "all tensor power spectra are for @xmath5 defined at @xmath6.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a serious impediment to measuring the tensor tilt will be noise coming from gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization fluctuations generated by scalar fluctuations .",
    "removing this signal is possible , using a procedure known as `` delensing '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in principle , with sufficiently high signal - to - noise measurements and in the absence of any primordial b - mode signal this delensing procedure can be done with arbitrarily high precision @xcite . the ability to remove the lensing signal requires a good map of the polarization fluctuations from the scalars ( e - mode polarization anisotropies ) and a good estimate of the intervening projected gravitational potential .",
    "e - mode polarization maps can be obtained only from sensitive cmb polarization measurements on the relevant angular scales , while the gravitational potential can either be estimated from the cmb data or obtained using astronomical sources as tracers of the potential .",
    "one of the most promising cmb lensing potential tracers is the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) .",
    "the cib is an extragalactic radiation field generated by the unresolved emission from star - forming galaxies ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is generated by dust which is heated by the uv light from young stars and then reradiates thermally in the infrared with a graybody spectrum of @xmath10 . due to its higher temperature , fluctuations in the cib dominate over the cmb on most angular scales at frequencies @xmath11ghz .",
    "the cib contains approximately half of the total extragalactic stellar flux , and has long been predicted to have excellent redshift overlap with the cmb lensing potential @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the cross - correlation between the lensing potential and high signal - to - noise measurements of the cib fluctuations from the _ planck _ and _ herschel _ satellites have upheld these predictions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we evaluate prospective constraints on @xmath0 using both the cmb and the cib to estimate the lensing potential . a similar study uses delensing to obtain constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , for @xmath5 values much smaller than the bicep2 initial claim of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to this work for a thorough investigation of the optimal use of cib data for delensing purposes , alone or in combination with the cmb .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this work ,",
    "we use the planck / wp / highl fiducial cosmology @xcite for all cosmological parameters except @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "we take the fiducial values of the tensor power spectrum parameters to follow the consistency relation @xmath12 , characteristic of the single - field slow - roll inflation models @xcite .",
    "the cmb temperature , cmb polarization and lensing potential power spectrum have been computed using the class boltzmann code @xcite .",
    "we discuss here the tools we used to achieve cmb delensing and to compute forecasted errors on the parameters describing the primordial b modes .",
    "gravitational lensing deflects cmb temperature and polarization primordial anisotropies according to @xcite : @xmath13 the lensing potential @xmath14 can be expressed as a line of sight integral : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hubble factor , @xmath17 the newtonian gravitational potential and @xmath18 the comoving distance to the redshift @xmath19 .",

    "thus , to delens b modes up to @xmath32 it is only required to accurately measure e modes up to @xmath33 , given a good map of the gravitational potential .",
    "obtaining accurate e - mode measurements on these scales is relatively straightforward : current ground - based cmb experiments such as sptpol @xcite , actpol @xcite , and polarbear @xcite make sample - variance limited measurements of the e - mode polarization on these scales .    for the lensing potential ,",
    "most of the lensing b modes are generated by gravitational potential fluctuations on half - degree scales or larger ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "there are again a number of possible tracers for these modes .",
    "cmb lensing measurements can be used , although polarization - based lensing measurements require high sensitivity and sensitivity to smaller angular scales than are required for large - scale tensor b - mode experiments ( such as bicep2 ) .",
    "alternatively , astrophysical tracers could be used to estimate the potential , provided they are sufficiently correlated with the lensing potential .",
    "the idea behind delensing is to build a noisy estimate of the lensing b modes using wiener - filtered e modes and lensing potential @xmath35 .",

    "we use the eb estimator which yields the best signal to noise ratio at high experimental sensitivities .",

    "it can be seen from equation ( [ eq : nlpp_eb ] ) that the lensing b modes act as a contaminant for the lensing reconstruction process . substituting the signal+noise lensed b modes of equation ( [ eq : nlpp_eb ] ) by delensed b modes ,",
    "defined in this forecast as @xmath42 one can estimate the lensing potential with higher signal - to - noise and then produce lower residual b modes . repeating these steps until convergence of @xmath43",
    "is referred to as iterative delensing @xcite .",
    "quadratic delensing will indicate the use of a delensed power spectrum @xmath43 computed through only one iteration .",
    "lensing reconstruction can also be achieved using large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "we explore here the possibility of estimating the lensing potential by using its cross - correlation with the cib , its best known tracer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we assume that high signal - to - noise cib measurements are available , and that the cross - correlation between the cib and the lensing potential can be well - approximated as flat with a constant correlation coefficient @xmath44 this simple approximation is quite accurate ( see for example fig .  13 of @xcite ) .",
    "including the poisson noise component to the cib power spectrum in equation ( [ eq : f_corr ] ) causes @xmath45 to fall off on small scales , but on scales larger than @xmath32 of interest for delensing , the flatness of the correlation factor is not substantially affected .",
    "although recent measurements have shown a correlation at the @xmath46 level , we will pessimistically also consider delensing with correlation coefficients as low as @xmath47 .",
    "this could effectively be the case , for example , in a region with comparable foreground and cib power .",
    "the introduction of this correlation coefficient results in a simple expression for the lensing estimate signal+noise power spectrum used in equation ; @xmath48    assuming gaussianity of the likelihood function @xmath49 which gives the probability distribution of a cosmological model @xmath50 given some set of independent observations @xmath51 , we use the fisher matrix formalism to compute forecasted errors on the tensor tilt .",
