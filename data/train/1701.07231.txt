    "a fundamental problem in statistical and solid mechanics is to explain theoretically why atoms at low temperature self - assemble into subsets of periodic lattices , and why these subsets exhibit specific polyhedral shapes .    in previous studies ,",
    "the specific shapes have been beautifully explained under two simplifications .",
    "first , one _ assumes _ crystallization , i.e. one restricts the admissible atomic positions to lattice sites .",
    "second , one passes to a coarse - grained description in which atomistic energy minimization is replaced by minimization of an effective surface energy of the region @xmath1 occupied by the atoms .",
    "such a surface energy governing the shape @xmath1 was first written down by gibbs , and in modern notation has the form @xmath2 here @xmath1 is an  up to regularity requirements arbitrary  subset of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the outward unit normal to @xmath1 at the point @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a surface energy density which captures the fact that interfaces with certain orientations with respect to the crystal lattice are favoured over others , and @xmath7 is the usual area element ( hausdorff measure @xmath8 ) on @xmath9 .",
    "a fundamental result going back to taylor @xcite and fonseca and mller @xcite states that minimizers of among sets of finite perimeter and fixed volume are unique up to translation , and given by a dilation of the _ wulff shape _ @xmath10 . for a related uniqueness result at finite temperature in the context of the 2d ising model see @xcite .",
    "microscopically , the situation regarding uniqueness is much more subtle .",
    "our goal in this note is to settle the uniqueness question completely in case of the two - dimensional heitmann - radin model , the perhaps simplest model describing the self - assembly of atoms into crystalline order and special shapes despite allowing arbitrary particle positions in @xmath11 .",
    "the heitmann - radin energy for a system of @xmath0 identical particles with positions @xmath12 , introduced in @xcite , is @xmath13 where here and below we abbreviate the position vector of all particles by @xmath14 and the interaction potential @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 the potential arises naturally from the lennard - jones potential @xmath17 by passing to the limit @xmath18 @xcite . in @xcite , heitmann and",
    "radin proved the fundamental result that for any fixed @xmath19 , the configurations @xmath20 minimizing @xmath21 are , up to rotation and translation , subsets of the triangular lattice @xmath22 moreover the authors give an explicit formula for the ground state energy from which it is elementary to deduce examples of non - uniqueness .",
    "such examples by no means contradicts the macroscopic uniqueness result for ; indeed in @xcite the associated macroscopic surface energy density @xmath6 is derived for the model , and it is shown that as the number of @xmath0 of particles gets large , the empirical measure @xmath23 associated with any sequence of microscopic minimizers converges after re - scaling to the characteristic function of the unique wulff shape .",
    "further insight into the uniqueness question was recently achieved by schmidt @xcite .",
    "he showed that microscopic regular hexagons ( figure [ f : uniqueness ] , left picture ) are the unique microscopic minimizer for their particle number , by re - writing the discrete energy in the form via introducing suitable tiles around each particle and applying the macroscopic uniqueness theorem for . moreover in @xcite it is shown that for particle numbers @xmath0 exceeding those of a microscopic regular hexagon by @xmath24 , the amount of nonuniqueness can be surprisingly large ( for a refinement of this result see @xcite ) .    here",
    "we completely settle the question of when microscopic uniqueness occurs .",
    "the result is as follows .",
    "[ uniqueness ] let @xmath19 .",
    "the minimizers of @xmath21 among @xmath0-particle configurations are unique up to translation and rotation if and only if either @xmath25 for some @xmath26 , or @xmath27 for some @xmath26 and some @xmath28 .    an explicit list of the numbers between 1 and 120 satisfying ( a ) or ( b ) was given in the abstract .",
    "case ( a ) corresponds to regular hexagons ( see the leftmost picture in figure [ f : uniqueness ] ) , recovering the uniqueness result of @xcite .",
    "the other uniqueness cases were neither previously conjectured , nor can they be established with the same method , as the microscopic minimizers are no longer regular hexagons and hence the associated continuum sets introduced in @xcite do not minimize the correspoding continuum energy .     with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "starting from the left : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the particles added to the regular hexagon on the left in order to obtain the unique minimizers are shown in red.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    our proof of theorem [ uniqueness ] relies on the discrete differential geometry approach introduced recently by us in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we used this approach to give a new proof of the heitmann - radin crystallization theorem ; here we employ it to settle the uniqueness question .",
    "this approach starts by associating , to each particle configuration @xmath37 , its bond graph , a planar graph ( see figure [ bondgraph ] ) whose definition we recall here : vertices correspond to the particle positions @xmath38 , edges to line segments @xmath39 $ ] connecting two particle positions of distance @xmath24 , and faces to open bounded subsets of @xmath11 which are nonempty , do not contain any point in @xmath20 , and whose boundary is given by a cycle @xmath40 $ ] of edges for some points @xmath41 with @xmath42 . a key result of @xcite needed in the proof of theorem [ uniqueness ] is the following geometric decomposition of the heitmann - radin energy on @xmath0-particle configurations : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the euler characteristic of the bond graph of @xmath20 , @xmath45 is its combinatorial perimeter as introduced in @xcite , namely the number of boundary edges with `` wire edges '' counted twice ( see figure [ bondgraph ] ) , and @xmath46 is the defect measure @xmath47 which can be viewed as a distance measure between the bond graph and vacancy - free subsets of the triangular lattice @xmath48 . see figure [ bondgraph ] .    .",
    "for the bond graph above , the euler characteristic @xmath49 is @xmath24 ( since the graph is connected ) , the defect measure @xmath50 ( see ) equals @xmath51 ( since the graph contains a square and a pentagon ) , and the combinatorial perimeter equals @xmath52 .",
    "the latter is because there are @xmath53 regular boundary edges , i.e. edges lying on the boundary of precisely one face , and @xmath54 wire edges , i.e. edges not lying on the boundary of any face , which must be counted twice .",
    "it follows that the right hand side of equals @xmath55 , which indeed agrees with the heitmann - radin energy of the configuration.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we begin by showing non - uniqueness in the case when the particle number @xmath0 is not of the form ( a ) or ( b ) in theorem [ uniqueness ] .",
    "first notice that for such @xmath0 , the `` canonical '' minimizer from @xcite ( see figure [ f : counterex ] , left picture ) has a non - convex angle at the boundary .     for @xmath56 , with @xmath30 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "+ left : the `` canonical '' minimizer from @xcite : starting from the grey particles constituting a regular hexagon with sidelength @xmath59 , the remaining ( red ) particles are added by following a counterclockwise path around the hexagon starting from the encircled point .",
    "+ right : another minimizer , obtained from the one on the left by moving the boxed segment of atoms .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    as in the figure , let @xmath60 be the number of complete sides of the canonical minimizer that were added to the central regular hexagon .",
    "when @xmath61 , we can move the first not yet covered side of the central hexagon ( boxed particles , left picture in figure [ f : counterex ] ) on top of the last not yet covered side of the central hexagon ( see figure [ f : counterex ] , right picture ) .",
    "this preserves @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and does not change the perimeter , and hence , by , yields another minimizer .",
    "when @xmath64 , we can instead move the first new side of the canonical minimizer obtained by covering the central hexagon on top of the third covered side , again leaving defect measure , euler characteristic and perimeter  and hence the heitmann - radin energy  unchanged .",
    "either way , the new minimizer is not a rotated translate of the canonical one .    before moving to the proof of uniqueness when @xmath0 is of form ( a ) or ( b ) , we introduce some notation ( which was also used in @xcite ) . for an @xmath0-point configuration , i.e. @xmath65 with @xmath66 , endowed with the planar graph structure described in the introduction",
    ", we say that @xmath67 is a _ boundary particle _ if it is adjacent to a boundary edge , i.e. an edge lying on the boundary of at most one face .",
    "we denote the set of boundary particles by @xmath68 , and say that @xmath20 has simply closed polygonal boundary if the union of boundary edges forms a simply closed curve .",
    "let us also recall the heitmann - radin crystallization theorem proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result says that minimizers of the heitmann - radin energy among arbitrary @xmath0-particle configurations , i.e. @xmath65 with @xmath66 , belong  up to translation and rotation and for @xmath69  to the set of crystallized configurations @xmath70 this reduces the uniqueness question to uniqueness among configurations in @xmath71 , and together with shows that @xmath72 moreover , to describe the numerical value of the ground state energy , we recall that for any @xmath19 there exists a uniquely determined triple + with @xmath73 and @xmath74 such that @xmath75 in terms of the numbers @xmath59 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , it follows from @xcite that @xmath78 finally , we will need the following result which is an immediate consequence of ( * ? ? ? * lemma 4.1 , lemma 4.2 ) .    [ lemmaimp ]",
    "let @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 and let @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 conversely , let @xmath83 and set @xmath84 then @xmath85    we are now in a position to prove the uniqueness statement in theorem [ uniqueness ] .",
    "we establish the claim only for @xmath0 of the form ( b ) , the proof in case ( a ) being analogous ( and an alternative proof in case ( a ) being already known @xcite ) .",
    "we use induction on @xmath86 .",
    "it is easy to see that the claim is satisfied for @xmath87 , for any value of @xmath76 in @xmath88 .",
    "fix such a @xmath76 . assuming that the minimizer is unique for @xmath89",
    ", we prove that it is unique for @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a minimizer of @xmath21 among @xmath0-particle configurations ; then by the heitmann - radin theorem @xmath20 belongs ( up to rotation and translation ) to @xmath71 , and by it satisfies @xmath91 .",
    "set @xmath81 .",
    "we have that @xmath92 . by lemma [ lemmaimp ] , we conclude that @xmath93 and hence all the above inequalities are equalities . therefore @xmath94 is a minimizer . by the inductive assumption ,",
    "the minimizer @xmath94 is unique ( up to rotation and translation ) .",
    "since , by the construction in lemma [ lemmaimp ] , the set @xmath20 is fully determined by @xmath94 , we obtain the claim .",
    "the above arguments show that @xmath95 where @xmath96 moreover , using one can easily check that for any @xmath97 , @xmath98 has a simple geometric meaning : it is the maximum particle number whose heitmann - radin minimizer has perimeter @xmath99 , in formulae :      it appears that the sequence @xmath101 is well - known in number theory ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xmath98 seems to co - incide with the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the diophantine equation @xmath102 nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , neither the geometric characterizations of @xmath98 in theorem [ uniqueness ] and nor the explicit one given in have been observed before .",
