    "the lhc will provide new opportunities to explore the physics of heavy flavour quarks .",
    "this note focuses on analyses in cms and atlas that are dedicated to the understanding of heavy flavour production .",
    "studies on heavy flavour decays are summarized in  @xcite .",
    "atlas and cms are expected to contribute to the study of heavy quark physics thanks to their excellent capabilities to detect muons up to large pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) and transverse momentum .",
    "since charm and beauty quarks will be produced in abundance , many analyses dedicated to heavy flavour production are viable already with small integrated luminosity . in the results presented below ,",
    "collisions are assumed to occur at 14 tev centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the outline of this note is as follows . in section 2 trigger strategies for heavy flavour physics analyses",
    "will be outlined .",
    "section 3 is devoted to quarkonium studies , including the @xmath2  cross section measurement , quarkonium polarization and reconstruction of @xmath3-states .",
    "similar analyses are being done in both experiments , but here we discuss only one analysis of each type . in section 4",
    "we discuss inclusive @xmath0-production .",
    "section 5 contains conclusions .",
    "the lhc bunch crossing rate at atlas and cms at nominal luminosity will be 40 mhz . via a level 1 ( l1 ) and a high level trigger ( hlt ) system",
    "the rate will be reduced to @xmath4 hz before the events are stored  @xcite .",
    "the relevant triggers for heavy flavour analyses in cms are :    * dimuon trigger",
    ". there are triggers with invariant mass cuts for selecting certain resonances ( @xmath2 s , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and triggers without invariant mass cuts ( e.g. for @xmath9 ) .",
    "the l1 and hlt trigger muon @xmath10 threshold for both muons is 3 gev / c ( the @xmath11 menu ) .",
    "in addition there is a hlt menu based on selecting events with a displaced dimuon vertex , for collecting events containing @xmath2 s produced in b - hadron decays . *",
    "single muon trigger , where both at l1 and at hlt one muon is required to exceed a given @xmath10 .",
    "different trigger @xmath10 thresholds are anticipated and the lowest thresholds will be prescaled triggers .    in atlas , two trigger scenarios are considered .    *",
    "dimuon trigger .",
    "two identified muons are required with a minimum @xmath10 threshold for the first and second muon of 6 and 4 gev / c respectively ( @xmath12 ) . at startup ,",
    "the threshold of the @xmath10 of the first muon may be lowered to 4 gev ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these menus are aimed at selecting low - mass resonances and non - resonance dimuon events . *",
    "single muon trigger . here",
    "only one identified muon is required with a threshold of @xmath14 gev / c ( @xmath15 ) . for quarkonium analyses , a second muon",
    "is then searched for offline among the other tracks reconstructed in the inner tracker .",
    "the single muon trigger can also be used for heavy flavour analyses with hadronic final states , or final states with electrons , jets or photons .",
    "inclusive quarkonium production at hadron colliders has been studied extensively in the theory of nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "one of the innovations of nrqcd is the so - called colour - octet mechanism ( com ) , which successfully explains the inclusive quarkonium cross section data at the tevatron .",
    "however , recent polarization measurements , which revealed unpolarized @xmath2 s  @xcite , are in clear contrast with com predictions .",
    "the colour singlet model ( csm ) has recently been revived  @xcite , but whether it can account for both cross section and polarization is still uncertain . in view of this puzzling situation and",
    "given the fact that quarkonia can be probed up to very large transverse momenta and with high statistics , it is very important to study quarkonium production at atlas and cms .",
    "quarkonia are additionally relevant because they are crucial for detector alignment and calibration .",
    "below we discuss feasibility studies on quarkonium production at cms and atlas .",
    "three processes dominate @xmath2  hadro - production : prompt @xmath2 s produced directly , prompt @xmath2 s produced indirectly ( via decay of heavier charmonium states such as @xmath3 ) , and non - prompt @xmath2 s from the decay of a b - hadron .",
    "cms proposes a measurement of the @xmath2@xmath16 differential cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the @xmath2 , @xmath17 , with 3 pb@xmath18 of data  @xcite .",
    "prompt and non - prompt @xmath2  events will be selected with the @xmath11 trigger , followed by a set of offline selection cuts including invariant mass and dimuon vertex requirements .",
    "the main background comes from any other source of muons that , when paired , could accidentally have an invariant mass close to that of the @xmath2 , i.e. muons from heavy flavour meson decay and @xmath19 decays - in - flight .",
    "it must be noted that cms can not reconstruct @xmath2 s with a transverse momentum below about 5 gev / c .",
    "[ ref1 ] ( left ) displays the invariant mass for prompt @xmath2 s , non - prompt @xmath2 s , and background .",
    "the yield per 1 pb@xmath18 of data is expected to be 25000 @xmath2 s and the mass resolution averaged over all @xmath20 values is roughly 30 mev/@xmath21 .",
    "the inclusive @xmath2  differential cross section will be measured by fitting the mass spectrum with a @xmath2  signal and a background hypothesis .",
    "the fraction @xmath22 of @xmath2 s from b - hadron decays in this study is determined by using decay length distributions . in each bin of @xmath17",
    "an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit to the data is performed .",
    "dominant systematic errors are the luminosity and the polarization uncertainties .",
    "the inclusive @xmath2  differential cross section and the fraction of @xmath2 s from b - decay with 3 pb@xmath18 of data are displayed in fig .",
    "[ ref1 ] ( center and right ) .      atlas has outlined a proposal for measuring the polarization of @xmath2  and @xmath6  states  @xcite . the @xmath2  polarization ( naturally the same holds for all quarkonia )",
    "can be inferred from the angular distribution of the muons from @xmath2  decay .",
    "looking in the @xmath2  rest frame , @xmath23 is defined as the angle between the @xmath24 and the direction of the motion of the @xmath2  in the laboratory frame .",
    "the normalized angular distribution is @xmath25 .",
    "unpolarized , transversely and longitudinally polarized @xmath2 s have @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "quarkonium events will be selected with the @xmath29 trigger ( at startup possibly the @xmath13 trigger ) .",
    "offline vertex cuts and invariant mass cuts will be made .",
    "due to detector effects no @xmath2 s can be reconstructed below @xmath17@xmath30 gev / c . for @xmath6",
    "s the corresponding threshold is about 2 gev / c . with the @xmath13 startup menu @xmath6 s",
    "could be reconstructed down to zero @xmath31 . the invariant mass distribution for @xmath2 s and @xmath6 s",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ ref2](left ) . the mass resolutions for @xmath2",
    "s and @xmath6 s are expected to be about 54 and 170 mev/@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the yield for 1 pb@xmath18 of data is 15000 @xmath2 s and 4000 @xmath6 s .         the reconstructed polarization angle for the @xmath29 is displayed in fig .  [ ref2](right ) .",
    "the acceptance is maximal in the region where @xmath32 , corresponding to the case where the two muons have roughly equal transverse momentum . in the region",
    "@xmath33 instead , the acceptance is zero .",
    "the reason is that here one muon is boosted and the other anti - boosted by the quarkonium , the latter not passing the dimuon trigger threshold .",
    "hence atlas anticipates to use additionally the @xmath15 trigger , and to reconstruct the @xmath2  by searching offline for a second muon track ( see sec .",
    "[ trig ] ) .",
    "this allows the slow muon to be detected only in the tracker , without having to pass any muon trigger thresholds , so sensitivity at @xmath33 is recovered , see fig .",
    "[ ref2 ]  ( right ) . using the",
    "@xmath15 trigger implies more background . while for @xmath2 s the background is manageable , for @xmath6 s the background is too high and the single muon trigger can not be used . the sensitivity to measure the polarization in the @xmath10 range 12 - 20",
    "gev / c is 0.02 - 0.06 for @xmath2 s and about 0.2 for @xmath6 s with 10 pb@xmath18 of data",
    ".      atlas has studied the reconstruction of the excited quarkonium states @xmath3 and @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "based on the fact that the angle @xmath35 between the photon and the @xmath2  is very tiny , a photon is searched for in a very narrow cone around the @xmath2(@xmath36 ) and the @xmath37 invariant mass is calculated . if the mass difference between the @xmath38 and the @xmath37 system is between 200 and 800 mev/@xmath21 the system is considered to be a @xmath39 candidate . by fixing the masses of the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 to their expected value",
    ", their relative contributions can be measured .",
    "b - production will be an abundant source of hadron production at the lhc . to disentangle the different contributions to production ( @xmath43 fusion and @xmath44 annihilation , flavour excitation , gluon splitting ) , measuring the @xmath45-hadron @xmath10 spectrum up to large momentum and with large statistics is important at the lhc . in cms  @xcite , b - hadron events will be selected with a l1 single muon trigger and a muon+@xmath0-jet hlt .",
    "offline b - jet tagging is applied .",
    "each reconstructed muon is associated with the most energetic @xmath0-tagged jet , and must be closest to this jet than to any other jet .",
    "the transverse momentum of the muon is calculated with respect to the b - jet axis , which discriminates effectively between signal and background , and thereby allows to determine the signal fraction from a fit to the data . in 10 fb@xmath18 of data about 16 million @xmath0-quark events",
    "are expected to be collected . the expected cross section uncertainty as a function of the @xmath10 of the @xmath0-tagged jet is given in fig .  [ ref3 ] .",
    "we have summarized a selection of analyses expected to be performed at cms and atlas in the context of heavy flavour production .",
