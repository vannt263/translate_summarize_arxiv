    "there are many good reasons for investigating the dynamics of thin accretion discs that are warped or twisted , in the sense that fluid elements closely follow circular keplerian orbits , but the orbital plane varies slowly with radius and possibly with time .",
    "the existence of such discs is supported by a growing body of observational evidence and theoretical reasoning .",
    "direct observational evidence for warped profiles has been obtained in exceptional cases , including the circumnuclear disc in the galaxy ngc  4258 , revealed through very - long - baseline interferometric observations of water masers ( miyoshi et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and the dusty circumstellar disc of @xmath0  pic ( e.g.  heap et  al",
    "indirect observational evidence comes from several low - mass x - ray binaries in which a long periodicity or other modulation is attributed to a precessing tilted disc ( see wijers & pringle 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the best example is the eclipsing system her  x-1 ( tananbaum et  al . 1972 ; katz 1973 ; roberts 1974 ) , but the precessing jets of ss  433 ( e.g.  margon 1984 ) also presumably originate in a tilted disc .",
    "further indirect evidence comes from pre - main - sequence binaries or unresolved young stellar objects from which two jets emanate in different directions ( see terquem et  al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "if the jets are emitted perpendicular to the discs that produce them , at least one of the discs must be misaligned with the binary orbital plane .",
    "such a misalignment appears to have been captured directly in images of hk tau ( stapelfeldt et  al .",
    "1998 ; koresko 1998 ) . in each of these cases , the disc can not simply be rigidly tilted , but must become warped under the influence of the tidal potential .    even without observational motivation , there are theoretical grounds for considering warped discs . in any situation in which , for historical reasons ,",
    "the disc is misaligned with the spin axis of a central black hole ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ) , the axis of a central magnetosphere , the orbit of a companion object ( papaloizou & terquem 1995 ) , or the angular momentum vector of matter being supplied at a large distance , the disc experiences a external torque that attempts to change its orientation .",
    "the response of the disc is basically gyroscopic , but , unlike a rigid body , it communicates internally through bending waves and ` viscous ' torques . in these situations",
    "the disc is likely to become warped , at least temporarily . even in a system that is initially",
    "coplanar , a warp may develop spontaneously through instabilities , which may be due to resonant tidal interactions ( lubow 1992 ; lubow & ogilvie 2000 ) , wind torques ( schandl & meyer 1994 ) , radiation torques ( pringle 1996 ) or magnetic torques ( lai 1999 ) .",
    "historically , attempts to describe the dynamics of warped accretion discs have involved deriving linear equations for slowly varying @xmath1 bending disturbances of an initially flat disc .",
    "it is usually assumed that the agent responsible for angular momentum transport in accretion discs ( probably magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ) may be treated as an isotropic effective viscosity , described by the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 . for keplerian discs an important qualitative distinction exists between significantly viscous discs ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the angular semi - thickness of the disc ) , in which warps evolve diffusively ( papaloizou & pringle 1983 ) , and almost inviscid discs ( @xmath5 ) , in which warps propagate as approximately non - dispersive waves ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) .",
    "however , a non - linear theory is required in many cases where the disc is warped sufficiently to have observational consequences .",
    "different approaches have been taken to the non - linear problem .",
    "direct numerical simulations have been carried out using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; e.g.  larwood et  al .",
    "1996 ; nelson & papaloizou 1999 ) .",
    "this method makes no attempt to resolve the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence but involves an artificial viscosity over which some control can be exerted .",
    "it is most suitable for relatively thick discs of limited radial extent , and these investigations have focused mainly on the case @xmath5 .",
    "usually good agreement is found with linear theory , but new , non - linear effects have also been found .",
    "the computational expense makes it difficult to follow the evolution of the disc on the long , viscous time - scale .",
    "meanwhile , the semi - analytical method has been developed into a non - linear theory .",
    "pringle ( 1992 ) adopted plausible evolutionary equations for a thin , viscous disc with a warp of arbitrary amplitude .",
    "the equations are simple conservation laws for mass and ( vector ) angular momentum in one ( radial ) dimension .",
    "the advantages of this approach are that the equations have a clear physical interpretation in terms of torques acting on rings , and that the numerical implementation is much less demanding than for a direct numerical simulation , so that the evolution of the disc on the viscous time - scale is easily described .    in an effort to provide a more complete justification of the latter approach ,",
    "i have developed a theory of fully non - linear bending waves in a thin , viscous disc , starting from the navier - stokes equation in three dimensions ( ogilvie 1999 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "it was shown that , in cases where the resonant wave propagation found in inviscid keplerian discs ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) may be neglected , the problem can indeed be reduced to one - dimensional evolutionary equations as suggested by pringle ( 1992 ) . moreover",
    ", the dimensionless coefficients in the equations , and their variation with the basic parameters of the disc and with the amplitude of the warp , were derived , and a proper connection was made with the existing linear theory .",
    "further discussion of the meaning and validity of this approach is given in section  5.2 below .",
    "it was recognized that the treatment of thermal physics in paper  i was oversimplified . in order to make the non - linear problem tractable ,",
    "a polytropic relation was assumed to hold locally in radius . in reality , the thickness of the disc and the stresses between neighbouring rings depend on a balance between the local rate of dissipation of energy and the radiation from the surfaces of the disc . in a warped disc , as a result of induced motions ,",
    "the viscous dissipation is enhanced where the warp is strongest , and this affects the non - linear dynamics of the warp .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give a proper treatment of thermal physics by solving an energy equation including viscous dissipation and radiative transport .",
    "remarkably , the problem can still be reduced by separation of variables to a set of dimensionless , non - linear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) which yield the required coefficients .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "i present the extended set of equations in section  2 and solve for the instantaneous azimuthal and vertical structure of the warped disc and the induced motions .",
    "i then deduce the complete set of evolutionary equations for the warped disc . in section  3",
    "the evolutionary equations are tested for stability with respect to short - wavelength perturbations .",
    "the outcome of numerical evaluation of the dimensionless torque coefficients and the local stability of the disc is presented in section  4 .",
    "the results are collected in section  5 in a concise form suitable for direct application , and the meaning and validity of the theory are discussed . in the appendix ,",
    "the possible effects of external irradiation are assessed .",
    "the detailed application of this theory to warped discs in x - ray binaries will be given in a forthcoming publication ( ogilvie & dubus 2000 ) .",
    "the basic equations and notation are taken to be the same as in paper  i ( equations i.37i.39 ) , except that the adiabatic condition ( equation i.38 ) is replaced by an energy equation that includes both viscous dissipation and radiative transport of energy within the rosseland approximation .",
    "the governing equations are therefore the equation of mass conservation , @xmath6 the equation of motion , @xmath7 +    \\nabla\\left[(\\mu_{\\rm b}-{\\textstyle{{2}\\over{3}}}\\mu )    \\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!{\\bmath u}\\right],\\ ] ] and the energy equation , @xmath8 +    ( \\mu_{\\rm b}-{\\textstyle{{2}\\over{3}}}\\mu )    ( \\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!{\\bmath u})^2-\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!{\\bmath f}. \\label{newenergy}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is the radiative energy flux , where @xmath10 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath11 the temperature and @xmath12 the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "the disc is assumed to be optically thick .",
    "the adiabatic exponent @xmath13 is assumed to be a prescribed function of radius , but a polytropic relation is no longer adopted .",
    "the equation of state is that of an ideal gas , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath16 the mean molecular mass ( assumed constant ) and @xmath17 the mass of the hydrogen atom . as in paper  i , the dynamic shear and bulk viscosities are assumed to be locally proportional to the pressure , so that @xmath18 where the dimensionless coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are prescribed functions of radius .",
    "finally , the opacity law is assumed to be of the general power - law form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "this includes the important cases of thomson scattering opacity ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and kramers opacity ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the appropriate values of @xmath22 are discussed in section  5.1 below .      in paper",
    "i the equations of fluid dynamics were derived in warped spherical polar coordinates , which follow the principal warping motion of the disc , and were then reduced by means of asymptotic expansions for a thin disc . in physical terms",
    ", this separates the ` fast ' orbital motion from the ` intermediate ' oscillatory velocities induced by the warp and from the ` slow ' velocities associated with accretion .",
    "the equations to be considered form two sets .    set  a , which determines the ` intermediate ' velocities ,",
    "is a set of coupled non - linear partial differential equations ( pdes ) in two dimensions , azimuthal and vertical .",
    "the physical content of set  a is as follows . in a flat disc ,",
    "the pressure and viscous stress are stratified in the vertical direction . when the disc is warped , this produces horizontal forces of odd symmetry about the mid - plane .",
    "these forces drive shearing horizontal epicyclic motions in the disc . the horizontal motions couple non - linearly with the warp itself to produce compressive vertical motions , causing the thickness of the disc to vary in azimuth .",
    "all the induced motions are subject to viscous damping and contribute to the energy dissipation rate . the problem defined by set  a is effectively instantaneous and local to a single annulus ; derivatives with respect to time and radius do not appear because of the separation of scales in a thin disc .",
    "the solution of set  a must be obtained in full .",
    "set  b , which determines the ` slow ' velocities , is a set of coupled linear pdes with coefficients depending on the solution of set  a. set  b does not have to be solved , however , because the necessary information can be extracted through certain integrations .",
    "this procedure amounts to obtaining the solvability conditions for the set of linear equations , and these conditions are precisely the required equations determining the evolution of the warp .",
    "physically , they involve a calculation of the instantaneous internal torque associated with the ` intermediate ' velocities and the deformed structure of the disc , known from the solution of set  a.    by replacing the adiabatic condition with the energy equation ( [ newenergy ] ) , equations ( i.69 ) in set  a and ( i.74 ) in set  b are modified . however , the manipulations of set  b in paper  i did not involve equation ( i.74 ) and are therefore unaffected .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the modifications to set  a.    recall that ( @xmath27 ) denote warped coordinates , which are based on spherical polar coordinates , but the equatorial plane @xmath28 is deformed to correspond to the warped mid - plane of the disc . for a thin disc ,",
    "the scaled dimensionless vertical coordinate @xmath29 is used , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "also @xmath32 denote the relative velocity components , which are proportional to the rates of change of the three coordinates following a fluid element .",
    "the shape of the warp is described through the unit tilt vector @xmath33 , which has euler angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the orbital angular velocity is @xmath36 and the associated epicyclic frequency is @xmath37 .",
    "a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath38 .    in this paper a simplified notation is adopted in which @xmath39 are written as @xmath40 .",
    "no confusion can result because set  b will not be considered explicitly .",

    "the numerical evaluation of the dimensionless torque coefficients proceeds similarly to paper  i. attention is restricted here to the case of a keplerian disc ( @xmath156 ) with adiabatic exponent @xmath157 and vanishing bulk viscosity ( @xmath158 ) .    in figs  13",
    "the coefficients @xmath94 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and also the products @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , are plotted as functions of the amplitude @xmath147 of the warp .",
    "three values for the viscosity coefficient , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , are investigated , and both thomson and kramers opacity are considered .",
    "the coefficients @xmath94 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 depend very little on the opacity law and are very similar to their values for the polytropic disc considered in paper  i. however , the coefficient @xmath106 increases rapidly with increasing amplitude , reflecting the thickening of the disc in response to increased viscous dissipation .",
    "the precise behaviour of @xmath106 depends to some degree on the opacity law .",
    "the products @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 reflect the true variation of the three torque components with the amplitude of the warp .",
    "if @xmath2 is large , say @xmath167 , the variation of @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 with amplitude is modest .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath2 the variation can be significant .",
    "in particular , if @xmath168 , @xmath94 can eventually become positive , meaning that the usual viscous torque parallel to @xmath169 is reversed . however , as noted in paper  i , the disc becomes highly non - axisymmetric in this limit and the validity of the solution appears questionable .",
    "the roots of the local dispersion relation for short - wavelength perturbations can be calculated from this information .",
    "the system is found to be stable for @xmath170 when @xmath171 or @xmath167 .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath2 , instability is found for sufficiently large @xmath147 .",
    "the critical values of @xmath147 for various values of @xmath2 are listed in table  1 .",
    "instability usually , although not invariably , occurs where @xmath94 is already positive .",
    "it has not been found possible to give an exact solution for the vertical structure of a _ warped _",
    "disc including the photospheric boundary conditions .",
    "the difficulties are especially pronounced in the case of a disc irradiated by the central x - ray source , since the irradiation then varies strongly with azimuth ( especially if the disc is partially self - shadowed ) and is one - sided , breaking the symmetry of the vertical structure .",
    "however , for @xmath172 the thermal time - scale is longer than the orbital time - scale and it is appropriate to average the irradiation over the orbital motion of the fluid .",
    "this restores the symmetry about the mid - plane and suggests that the effect on the @xmath100@xmath68 relation will be similar to that found above for a flat disc ."
