    "t dwarfs are the coolest ( @xmath3k , @xcite ; @xcite ) and least luminous brown dwarfs observed . with atmospheres rich in molecular gases and condensate clouds",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , these sources represent a class of object intermediate between giant planets and low mass stars .    in the cool atmospheres of t dwarfs , methane and water vapor",
    "are formed in abundance .",
    "these give rise to broad absorption features in the near - infrared , which distinguish t dwarfs from hotter brown dwarfs in which the production of atmospheric methane is prohibited by collisional dissociation ( @xcite ) .",
    "these prominent ch@xmath4 and h@xmath5o features have been used to construct schemes of spectral classification for these objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . because of their low photospheric temperatures , an understanding the atmospheres of t dwarfs is likely to yield important clues about the nature of giant planetary atmospheres .",
    "a statistically complete census of t dwarfs is highly desirable in an effort to extend our understanding of the initial mass function to lower masses , but cataloguing t dwarfs can be a time consuming process . with faint intrinsic magnitudes and near - infrared colors similar to most main sequence stars , t dwarf candidates can be buried in an overwhelming number of background sources .",
    "traditional spectroscopic follow - up of large samples is extremely time consuming and has typically had low rates of success . @xcite",
    "describe a new method for simplifying the search process , based on imaging through ch@xmath4 filters . here",
    "we describe a new t dwarf discovered by this method .",

    ". section  [ sec : results ] describes the observations and empirical properties of the new t dwarf 2mass j21513839 - 4853542 , hereafter 2m2151 - 4853 .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the 2mass wide - field t dwarf search is an attempt to conduct a census of the t dwarf population over most of the sky .",
    "the selection process is described in detail by @xcite , and is summarized here .",
    "the initial sample has been culled from the 2mass all sky working database ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , via color and magnitude selection .",
    "areas within a galactic latitude @xmath6 have been excluded to avoid regions where source confusion will be problematic .",
    "likewise the magellanic clouds , and other dense source regions have been omitted . to facilitate follow up observations , regions within 2@xmath7 of the equatorial poles were also omitted . in total",
    "the search covers 74% of the sky .    from this sample objects",
    "were selected with @xmath8 or @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and no counterpart in the usno - a2.0 catalogue ( @xcite ) , effectively @xmath11 .",
    "this range of color is sufficiently broad to accommodate warmer t dwarfs , as early as type t1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this selection process yields over 250,000 targets .",
    "since it is expected that there will only be 20 - 30 t dwarfs in this sample ( @xcite ) , further discrimination of the targets has been made on the basis of visual classification by ajb and mwm , leaving @xmath12 targets .",
    "targets from this list are being observed as part of a methane imaging program .",
    "our methane imaging program of 2mass t dwarf candidates is described in full by @xcite .",
    "images were taken through the ch@xmath4s and ch@xmath4l filters with the infrared camera and spectrograph ( iris2 ) on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope , siding spring , australia .",
    "the ch@xmath4l filter covers the wavelength range of the strong methane absorption features in the infrared h band , which define the spectral type t dwarfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile the ch@xmath4s filter samples a wavelength range outside the methane absorption ( though within the range of absorption by other molecules such as h@xmath5o ) .",
    "the methane observations were calibrated via a series of extensive observations described in @xcite .",
    "stars of known spectral standard were observed , and then calibrated according to observations of a , f and g stars which show virtually no color variation in ch@xmath4s@xmath13ch@xmath4l , and k and m stars for which the methane colors have been empirically calibrated .",
    "methane observations of 2m2151 - 4853 , as described above , were made on 2003 june 11 ( ut ) , in patchy cloud ( which appears not to have affected our imaging ) and 1.1 arcsec seeing .",
    "exposures of 30 seconds in each of the ch@xmath4s and ch@xmath4l filters were made .",
    "images were dark subtracted and flat fielded using standard procedures with the pipeline reduction software , orac - dr .",
    "the flat fields were made by median combining jittered images of the targets .",
    "finding charts extracted from these images and the 2mass h band image are shown in figure  [ fig : find ] .",
    "sextractor ( @xcite ) was used to measure magnitudes in fixed apertures of @xmath14 arcsec diameter .",
    "the differential photometry was calibrated using the procedure described in @xcite using 2mass sources in the field , to produce figure  [ fig : colmag ] .",
    "a plot of ch@xmath4s@xmath13ch@xmath4l against ch@xmath4s is shown in figure  [ fig : colmag ] with 2m2151 - 4853 clearly visible above the other objects in the field .",
    "a comparison of the methane color of 2m2151 - 4853 with the calibrated methane colors of a stars through to t dwarfs is shown in figure  [ fig : methane_id ] , taken from @xcite .",
    "the color of ch@xmath4s@xmath13ch@xmath4l=@xmath15 suggests that 2m2151 - 4853 is of type t2.5@xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : methane_id ] highlights the power of the methane imaging methodology .",
    "short images of the target field are made through the ch@xmath4 filters .",
    "any t dwarfs present in the field will be immediately obvious in a plot of ch@xmath4s@xmath13ch@xmath4l , standing out prominently from the locus of points made up from the hotter stars .",
    "furthermore , a first estimate of spectral type within the t dwarf class can be made from the methane color .",
    "thus only t dwarf candidates with unusual methane colors ever need to be followed up with spectroscopic observations .",
    "hs band spectroscopy of 2m2151 - 4853 was obtained using iris2 on 2004 june 23 ( ut ) .",
    "the seeing was @xmath17 arcseconds , and there was patchy cloud cover .",
    "this spectrum was taken with very low signal to noise , sufficient to identify 2m2151 - 4853 as a t dwarf , but not to classify its spectral type .",
    "higher signal to noise spectra spectra were then obtained on 2004 august 22 ( ut ) under good conditions ( seeing @xmath18 arcseconds and clear sky ) in the hs and jl bands .",
    "the total exposure was 15 minutes in each band .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded using dome flats created from a lamp - on@xmath13lamp - off sequence .",
    "the wavelength calibration was achieved through imaging of a xe arc lamp .",
    "the flattened spectra were divided by a normalized spectrum of a g dwarf telluric standard star to remove the effect of absorption bands .",
    "the final spectra , binned by a factor of six to improve signal to noise , are shown in figure  [ fig : spect ] , along with the spectrum of the t4.5 dwarf , 2mass j05591914 - 1404488 , hereafter 2m0559 - 1404 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distinctive absorption features due to h@xmath5o and ch@xmath4 are clearly visible , and are identified at the top of each figure , along with the ki absorption lines in the jl band .",
    "[ fig : spect2 ]    spectral classification schemes have been devised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have used the spectral indices of both schemes within the wavelength range of our spectra , to check the classification based on the methane colors described above .",
    "both schemes define spectral indices based on distinctive h@xmath5o and ch@xmath4 features in t dwarf spectra .",
    "@xcite define the diagnostics given in equation  [ eqn : burgindex ] , based on the mean flux within the regions of interest , and those of a neighboring region of the spectrum outside the absorption feature , and calculating their ratio . for the case of 2m2151 - 4853",
    "we have ,    @xmath19    where the subscripts denote the wavebands of interest in @xmath20 m .",
    "@xcite list index values for t dwarf standards in their table  10 .",
    "a comparison with that table shows that 2m2151 - 4853 lies between type t3 and t5 for all the diagnostics ( there is no type t4 standard listed ) .    @xcite",
    "define similar indices based on the integrated flux from diagnostic regions of t dwarf spectra .",
    "computing their indices for 2m2151 - 4853 we find ,    @xmath21    where the limits of the integrals are given in @xmath20 m .",
    "@xcite present a look - up table of indices for different spectral types . comparing to this ( table 5 in their paper ) , we find that the ch@xmath4 and h@xmath5o indices indicate that 2m2151 - 4853 is of type t5 and t4 respectively .",
    "a hybrid system between the schemes of @xcite and @xcite is in development , utilizing a unified set of fundamental t dwarfs and spectroscopic indices ( @xcite ) . we compared a subset of the revised spectral indices for this scheme ( presented in @xcite ) between the spectrum of 2m2151 - 4853 and those of a set of t dwarf comparison sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "these indices yield a mean spectral type of t4.5 for 2m2151 - 4853 , consistent with the above indices .",
    "this classification is further verified by the similarity of j and h band spectra with those of 2m0559 - 1404 ( figure  [ fig : spect ] ) , itself a t4.5 dwarf ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 2mass photometry available for 2m2151 - 4853 has been used to derive an estimate of distance .",
    "we have compared the 2mass magnitudes to the spectral type ",
    "absolute magnitude relations given by @xcite and @xcite . in order to make the comparison with @xcite the 2mass magnitudes were first transformed to the cit magnitude system using the relations of @xcite .",
