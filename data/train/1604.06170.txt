    "owen ( 1988 , 1990 , 1991 ) introduced empirical likelihood ( el ) method which is the data - driven method combining the advantages of parametric and nonparametric methods .",
    "the most appealing property of the el method is that the associated empirical likelihood ratio statistics asymptotically follows standard chi - square distribution , which is same as the one used in parametric analysis .",
    "since then , it has been widely used to make statistical inference of parameters and construct confidence regions .",
    "see owen ( 2001 ) for more details .",
    "however , when the data is dependent , it becomes difficult to apply the empirical likelihood method as it is originally designed for independent observations . using el method to address dependent data problems has been studied by many researchers .",
    "mykland ( 1995 ) established the connection between the dual likelihood and the empirical likelihood through the martingale estimating equations and applied it to time series model .",
    "monti ( 1997 ) developed the idea of extending the el method to short - memory stationary time series by using the whittle s ( 1953 ) method to obtain an m - estimator of the periodogram ordinates of time series models which are asymptotically independent .",
    "however , his method can not be applied directly to long - time memory time series model .",
    "kitamura ( 1995 ) developed the blockwise empirical likelihood method for time series models . for long - memory or long - range dependence time series data ,",
    "hurvich and beltrao ( 1993 ) showed that the normalized periodogram ordinates obtained from a gaussian process are asymptotically neither independent identically distributed nor exponentially distributed .",
    "nordman and lahiri ( 2006 ) developed frequency domain empirical likelihood based on the spectral distribution through the fourier transformation to study short and long range dependence .",
    "yau ( 2012 ) extended monti s idea to autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average ( arfima ) model by showing that the dependence in periodogram only applies to a small portion of the periodogram ordinates with fourier frequencies tending to zero .",
    "however , the profile empirical likelihood function computation which involves constrained maximization requires the convex hull of the estimating equation to have zero vector as an interior point . when the solution does not exist , owen ( 2001 ) suggested assigning @xmath0 to the log - el statistic .",
    "chen et al . (",
    "2008 ) pointed out the drawbacks in doing so and proposed an adjusted empirical likelihood ( ael ) method by adding a pseudo term which always guarantees the existence of a solution .",
    "they further showed that the asymptotic results of the ael are similar to that of the el .",
    "moreover , it achieves improved coverage probabilities without using bartlett - corrections .",
    "based on their work , piyadi gamage et al .",
    "( 2016 ) modified monti s work by proposing an adjusted empirical likelihood for short - memory time series models .    in this paper , we extend yau s el method for arfima model by proposing an adjusted empirical likelihood method .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", the el for arfima models is discussed .",
    "the ael for stationary arfima model is derived and the asymptotic distribution of the ael statistic is established in section 3 .",
    "simulations are carried out in section 4 to compare the confidence regions of the proposed ael method to the el method for arfima model for different distributions for the white noise term .",
    "in addition , coverage probabilities are calculated to illustrate the effectiveness of ael method as compared to el method with and without bartlett - correction for different values of the parameters , different sample sizes and different distributions for the white noise term .",
    "section 5 provides some discussion and proofs of results are given in the appendix .",
    "a stationary arfima(p , d , q ) process  @xmath1  is given by @xmath2 for some @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the backward shift operator ( @xmath5 ) , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the absolute values of the roots of these two polynomials are all greater than 1 to guarantee the stationarity and invertibility of the model .",
    "we also assume that  @xmath8  and  @xmath9  have no common factors to avoid the redundancy of the parameters .",
    "we only consider the values of  @xmath10  between 0 and 0.5 since it is the most interesting long - memory scenario ( beran , 1994 ) and only under this condition the dependence structure of periodogram ordinates has been established ( yau , 2012 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 @xmath12 is estimated by whittle s method ( whittle , 1953 ) based on the periodogram where @xmath13 is a compact subset of the @xmath14-dimensional euclidean space @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be @xmath17 observations from the process in .",
    "an approximate log - likelihood function is given by whittle ( 1953 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spectral density and @xmath20\\ ] ] is the periodogram ordinate evaluated at fourier frequency @xmath21 the whittle s estimator , @xmath22 , maximizes over @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , it is the solution of  @xmath23  where @xmath24 monti ( 1997 ) showed that this estimator has the interpretation of an m - estimator from asymptotically independent periodogram ordinates and applied the empirical likelihood to short - memory time series models . as pointed out by yau ( 2012 ) , the el method used by monti ( 1997 ) can not be directly applied to long - memory scenario due to the dependence structure of the periodogram . as shown in lemma 1 of yau ( 2012 ) ,",
    "the periodogram ordinates are asymptotically independent which ensures that the empirical likelihood ratio statistic to be chi - squared distributed and uses the @xmath25 s in equation to construct the empirical likelihood .    following monti s ( 1997 )",
    "argument , yau ( 2012 ) extended the empirical likelihood ratio statistic to the arfima(p , d , q ) model defined by @xmath26 , \\tag{2.4}\\label{eq:2.4}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the lagrangian multiplier satisfying @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the empirical likelihood ratio for time series models defined by @xmath30 subject to the constraints:(i ) @xmath31 , ( ii ) @xmath32 , and ( iii ) @xmath33 with @xmath34^{-1}$ ] . by extending monti s result to arfima models , yau ( 2012 ) showed that @xmath35 also has an asymptotic chi - squared distribution with @xmath14 degrees of freedom where @xmath36",
    "the definition of @xmath35 in ( 2.4 ) depends on obtaining positive @xmath37 such that @xmath38 for each @xmath39 . under some moment conditions on @xmath40 ( owen 2001 )",
    ", the solution exists if the convex hull @xmath41 contains 0 as its interior point with probability 1 as @xmath42 .",
    "when the parameter @xmath39 is not close to @xmath22 , or when @xmath43 is small , there is a good chance that the solution to the equation @xmath31 does nt exist which raises some computational issues as mentioned by chen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . to overcome this difficulty , chen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed an adjusted empirical likelihood ( ael ) ratio function by adding @xmath44-th term to guarantee the zero to be an interior point of the convex hull so that the required numerical maximization always has a solution . by doing so , they modified owen s method and applied it to dependent observations with the asymptotic null distribution of the statistic as obtained by owen .",
    "we adopt their idea to modify yau s method for arfima models .",
