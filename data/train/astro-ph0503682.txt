    "the cooling and thermal balance of the primordial , zero - metallicity gas by molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath11 ) and deuterated hydrogen ( hd ) are key ingredients in the formation process of the first baryonic objects in the universe , such as dwarf - sized galaxies and pop - iii stars ( see for recent reviews on this topic barkana & loeb 2001 ; ciardi & ferrara 2004 ; bromm & larson 2004 ) . it is well known that h@xmath11 and hd molecules form in the universe after recombination ( e.g. , lepp & shull 1984 ; puy et al .",
    "1993 ; palla , galli , & silk 1995 ; galli & palla 1998 ; stancil , lepp , & dalgarno 1998 ) . the formation of h@xmath11 and hd molecules in primordial gas is also possible in a postshock flow ( mac low & shull 1986 ; shapiro & kang 1987 ; uehara & inutsuka 2000 ) , where the gas density and temperature , as well as the molecular fractions , are different from those of the expanding homogeneous gas .    the h@xmath11 molecule is considered typically as the main coolant in the primordial medium ( e.g. , tegmark et al . 1997 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) .",
    "thus , rather detailed calculations were carried out for it ( see for the most recent results and references therein le bourlot , pineau des forts & flower 1999 ; flower et al .",
    "2000 ; shaw et al . 2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of dense primordial gas , the role of the hd molecule in the thermal and cooling process may become comparable to or more important than the one of h@xmath11 .",
    "therefore , detailed calculations of the hd cooling function ( the rate of cooling per hd molecule , hereafter cf ) are needed .",
    "the hd molecule is an efficient coolant in the primordial medium because it has a permanent electric dipole moment that allows high probabilities for the radiative rotational transitions from the rotational levels pumped by collisions with h and he . besides the hd molecule was efficiently produced in the reaction of chemical fractionation @xmath12 , which leads to a strong enhancement of the initial abundance of hd , up to roughly @xmath13/[h_{2}]=10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ ] ( e.g. puy et al .",
    "1993 ; galli & palla 1998 ; flower 2000 ) .",
    "the hd molecule can cool the primordial gas to temperatures below @xmath14 k because it has allowed dipole rotational transitions characterized by energies two times smaller than those of the quadrupole transitions of h@xmath15 . in that regard higher temperatures ( @xmath16k ) , cooling by hd",
    "can be again as important as that by h@xmath15 .",
    "this question will be discussed in the present paper .",
    "the hd cf was calculated for the first time by dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) for low temperatures and boltzmann distributed rotational level populations .",
    "varshalovich & khersonskii ( 1976 ) improved the calculations by taking into account the departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "more recently , flower et al . ( 2000 , and see also more references therein ) have calculated the hd cf for low and intermedium kinetic temperatures and a large range of densities .",
    "these authors considered the rotational transitions within the vibrational ground state @xmath17 of hd .",
    "note that in the case of higher kinetic temperatures ( @xmath18 ) , the populations of the vibrational levels become significant , and cooling by ro - vibrational transitions of hd may be important due to ( i ) the relatively high energy of vibrational quanta , and ( ii ) the relatively high probabilities of the ro - vibrational radiative transitions .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the the vibrational structure of the hd molecule in the calculation of its cf might be important .",
    "the aim of this paper is to recalculate the hd cf for a wide range of kinetic temperatures and densities by taking into account ro - vibrational transitions within ground @xmath17 and the first three excited @xmath19 vibrational levels .",
    "further exploration of the influence of the hd cf calculated here on the thermal evolution of the primordial medium will be presented elsewhere . in ",
    "2 we give details of our calculations .",
    "the revised hd cf is given and compared with that from flower et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in  3 .",
    "finally , in  4 we discuss our results and speculate about possible implications .",
    "it is well known that in the low density limit ( @xmath20@xmath7 ) , the relative populations of the levels of hd molecule depart significantly from the boltzmann distribution .",
    "therefore , to calculate the hd cf in the general case , we need the correct values of the ro - vibrational level populations outside the thermodynamical equilibrium . this can be calculated by using the equations of detailed population level balance : @xmath21where @xmath22  is the population of the ro - vibrational level @xmath23 , @xmath24  and @xmath25  are the probabilities of the radiative and collisional transitions , respectively . we assume a steady state for the population levels . this assumption has been used and discussed to be valid in our context by many other authors ( e.g. , flower et al .",
    "2000 ; flower & pineau des forts 2001 ; le petit , roueff & le bourlot 2002 ) .",
    "the population of the ro - vibrational levels of the @xmath26 molecule was calculated in the wide range of number densities @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29@xmath7 , and for the kinetic temperature @xmath30 from @xmath31 to @xmath4 k. the ro - vibrational radiative transition probabilities for the hd molecule were taken from abgrall et al .",
    "( 1982 ) . regarding the collisional transition probabilities , it was shown in flower et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the hd cf is insensitive to the h / h@xmath15 density ratio .",
    "therefore , one may take into account the excitation and de - excitation of hd only by collisions with the h atoms .",
    "the probabilities of the collisionally excited pure rotational transitions of hd ( up to the third vibratioanally excited state , @xmath32 , and up to the 8-th rotational level @xmath33 ) were taken from roueff & flower ( 1999 ) and roueff & zeippen ( 1999 ) .",
    "we consider only the dipolar transitions ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "owing to the permanent dipolar moment of the hd molecule , these transitions dominate collisional population transfer ( flower & roueff 1999 ) .",
    "flower & roueff ( 1999 ) computed probability coefficients for several ro - vibrational transitions in hd induced by collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen in a range of temperatures from 100 to 2000 k. in that paper , some values of the transition probabilities for the vibrational relaxation @xmath35 are presented and compared with the corresponding coefficients for h@xmath15 .",
    "the rate coefficients for vibrational relaxation of hd and h@xmath11 in collisions with h are similar in magnitude for a given temperature .",
    "besides , the probabilities for both molecules change approximately in the same way with temperature . on the basis of these results and in the absence of extensive calculations for the hd+h collisional ro - vibrational transition probabilities in the range of temperatures we want to explore , we will use the corresponding probabilities of the h@xmath15+h ( tin , lepp & dalgarno 1998 ) given in electronic form on the website http://www.physics.unlv.edu/astrophysics/h2h2rates/index.html ( lepp , tin & dalgarno 1997 , in preparation ) .",
    "the total cf per unit of volume is defined , for example for the hd molecule , as : @xmath36where @xmath37 is the hd number density , and @xmath38 is the hd cf in unities of erg s@xmath39 per hd molecule : @xmath40here , @xmath41  are the probabilities of the radiative transitions with the emission of the photon @xmath42 , and @xmath43  are the probabilities of radiative transition with the absorption of the corresponding field photon . the symbols @xmath44 and @xmath45 are for the corresponding einstein coefficients and @xmath46 is the radiation field .",
    "the populations of the ro - vibrational levels @xmath22 are those calculated from the balance equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this definition of @xmath38 is more general than the one used in flower et al . (",
    "2000 ) , because it takes into account the potential effects of a radiation field in the cooling process . in the case of @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) tends to the case considered in flower et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . at high redshifts , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) temperature , @xmath48 , may become comparable to the kinetic temperature of the gas @xmath30 ; this will significantly affect the hd cf at that @xmath30 ( see below for more details ) .",
    "1 we present the variation of @xmath38 with @xmath30 and @xmath27 .",
    "the dotted - line curves correspond to the hd cf , neglecting the collisional ro - vibrational transitions as in flower et al .",
    "our results agree very well with those of these authors .",
    "note that we did not consider collisions of hd with he and h@xmath15 because , as it was mentioned above , flower et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that @xmath38 is essentially a function of @xmath30 and @xmath27 only .",
    "the solid - line curves in fig .",
    "1 are the cfs including ro - vibrational collisional transitions for a 4-level vibrational structure of the hd molecule ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "one sees that the latter cfs depart from the former , as @xmath30 and @xmath27 are larger . for @xmath50@xmath7 and @xmath51k ,",
    "the calculated value of @xmath38 including the vibrational transitions is more than a factor of fifty larger than the @xmath38 calculated neglecting collisional ro - vibrational transitions .",
    "note that in fig . 1 , @xmath38 has been calculated for @xmath52 k ( the cmbr temperature at present ) , i.e. , well within the limit @xmath47 , when the radiation field does not participate in the thermal balance of the gas and eq .",
    "( 3 ) is reduced to the equation for @xmath38 used in flower et al .",
    "this way were able to compare our results with those of these authors .",
    "the exact hd cf data presented here are available at http://www.cifus.uson.mx/personal_pages/anton/ data / hd_cooling / hd_cool.html . to facilitate the use of the hd cf in computational programs",
    "we give also a polynomial approximation for the hd cf .",
    "the approximation is very accurate in the ranges of @xmath27 and @xmath30 studied here , from @xmath28 to @xmath6 @xmath7 , and from @xmath31 to @xmath4 k , respectively .",
    "the approximation is writen in the form : @xmath53where the coefficients @xmath54 are tabulated in table 1 .",
    ".polynomial coefficients @xmath54 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from fig .",
    "1 one clearly sees how @xmath38 increases at high densities after including the collisional ro - vibrational level transitions . in the case of low densities ,",
    "the contribution of these transitions to the cooling of hd is less important .",
    "nevertheless , at high temperatures @xmath38 is still larger than in the case when these transitions are omitted ( pure rotational transitions shown by dashed line at fig .",
    "therefore , the analytical approximation commonly used for the low density limit ( see e.g. , galli & palla 2002 ) should be slightly modified .",
    "the approximation given in galli & palla ( 2002 ) is based on the calculations for only two low rotational transitions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , because the collisional probabilities of these transitions are rather large as compared with those of higher rotational levels .",
    "however , it should be stressed that when the vibrational structure is taken into account , then there are other ro - vibrational transitions with comparable probabilities of collisional excitation . based on our results ,",
    "we suggest the following modified approximation for the low - density limit hd cf : @xmath57 this aproximation can be applied for the gas density @xmath27 up to @xmath58 @xmath7 .",
    "the effects of the radiation field @xmath46 in @xmath38 become important when @xmath59 ( flower 2000 ; flower & pineau des forts 2001 ) . in this case , the radiative absorption by the hd molecule dominates and the second term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , as well as the @xmath60 term in the probability @xmath61 , should be considered . the second term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be interpreted as a heating function . at the redshfits at which the first baryon objects are expected to form ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the cmb temperature can be similar to the typical kinetic temperatures of the small primordial gas clouds . in fig .",
    "2 we present the complete hd cfs ( with the collisional ro - vibrational transitions included ) considering a radiative field with @xmath63 for redshifts @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( dotted , dashed and long - dashed lines , respectively ) and for two densities , @xmath67 and @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "one sees that when @xmath59 , @xmath38 falls dramatically . the second term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) actually comes to dominate and the hd molecular lines act as heating sources .",
    "this will inhibit the collapse of a gas cloud .",
    "therefore the minimum temperature of the primordial collapsing clouds is limited by the cmbr temperature ( or by the heating due to other radiation fields ) and not by hd ( and h@xmath15 ) cooling .",
    "we note that the steady state assumption for the hd population levels ( see  2 ) remains even at the high redshifts considered here .",
    "the typical time scales for population level changes are determined mainly by the inverse of the transition einstein coefficients . for the hd molecule transitions these coefficientes imply typical time scales much less than the time scales related to variations in @xmath68 and/or to the gas clouds collapse in the epochs considered here ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we have calculated the hd cf , @xmath38 , for a wide range of kinetic temperatures and gas densities by taking into account the ro - vibrational structure of the molecule for both the radiative and collisional transitions .",
    "we have found that , when including the collisional ro - vibrational transitions , the cooling efficiency of hd molecule is higher than previously reported .",
    "the main increasing of @xmath38 as compared to previous works is at the high - temperature side and for high densities ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; for @xmath70 @xmath7 , the differences in @xmath38 reach an order of magnitude and more at @xmath71 . our results in support of recent claims ( flower 2000 ; uehara & inutsuka 2000 ; flower & pineau des forts 2001 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ; galli & palla 2002 ) , suggest that the hd molecule may play an important role in the thermal balance and cooling of primordial gas at high densities .    in fig .",
    "3 we attempt to compare the relative contributions to the cf of the gas by the h@xmath11 and hd molecules . because the ratio of abundances of hd to h@xmath11 is significantly smaller than 1 , the @xmath38 curves should be reduced by a factor equal to this ratio in order to compare the contributions to the cooling of gas by both molecules . as it was mentioned above",
    ", this ratio for the primordial gas , after chemical fractionation , is approximately @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "3 , we reduce @xmath38 by a factor of @xmath13/[h_{2}]=10^{-2.4}$ ] according to galli & palla ( 2002 ) for @xmath64 . as one can see in fig .",
    "3 , the role of hd in the cooling of low - density gas is still unimportant with respect to the one of h@xmath11 , while for high densities , hd becomes as efficient a coolant as h@xmath11 , being even more efficient at low temperatures .",
    "the h@xmath11 cf has been calculated according to flower et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the contribution to the gas cooling of hd found here for high gas densities and temperatures larger than @xmath10 k is close to the corresponding contribution of h@xmath11 .",
    "this will surely affect calculations of galaxy formation in the regime when dense gas cools down from temperatures above @xmath10 k. this regime may arise in photoionization - heated gas or in shock - heated dense material in dwarf galaxy - size dark matter halos with masses @xmath73 m@xmath74 ( bromm & larson 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of an efficient coolant , besides that h@xmath11 , able to operate at @xmath75 k and at high densities ( as is the case of hd ) is probably also relevant to understand the formation of the first globular clusters .",
    "bromm & clarke ( 2002 ) have shown that , under the action of an efficient coolant at @xmath76 k , stellar clusters with masses @xmath77 may form into small dark matter subhalos that later on are tidally destroyed during the violent relaxation of dwarf galaxy - sized halos at @xmath78 ( see also weil & pudritz 2001 ) .",
    "the cooling efficiency of h@xmath15 or hd molecules increases with density until the population levels reachs the local thermodynamical equilibrium at a critical density @xmath79 , in such a way that at @xmath79 the probability of collisional de - exitation becomes equal to the spontaneous radiative probability . beyond this density",
    ", the cooling is saturated . for molecular hydrogen ,",
    "the critical density is rather low , @xmath80 @xmath7 , due to the relatively small values of the h@xmath15 einstein coefficients . in the case of the hd molecule ,",
    "the einstein coefficients are larger as compared to those of h@xmath15 by @xmath81 orders of magnitude .",
    "one may estimate the ratio of critical densities @xmath82 as @xmath83 , which is @xmath84 for radiative vibrational transitions .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is indeed around two orders of magnitude higher than @xmath86 . from fig . 1 ( see also flower et al .",
    "2000 ) , one sees that @xmath87 @xmath7 . to conclude",
    ", we remark the importance of taking into consideration the hd cf calculated here in the simulations and models of the first baryonic objects in the universe . in particular , those processes related to dense gas that cool down from temperatures above @xmath10 k will be affected by our results .",
