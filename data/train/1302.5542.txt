    "oseledets splitting _ is @xmath14-invariant , measurable , but in general not continuous .",
    "for example , the dimensions of the subbundles may depend on the basepoint .",
    "notice that the oseledets splitting always refines the finest dominated splitting , since domination forces a gap between lyapunov exponents .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for any ergodic measure @xmath26 , the generic automorphism @xmath14 has the property that the oseledets splitting coincides @xmath26-almost everywhere with the finest dominated splitting above the support of the measure . in this paper",
    "we obtain this property simultaneously for all measures , under suitable assumptions :    we say the space @xmath1 has _ finite dimension _ if it is homeomorphic to a subset of some euclidean space .",
    "for instance , subsets of manifolds ( assumed as usual to be hausdorff and second countable ) have finite dimension .",
    "we say that the homeomorphism @xmath5 is _ minimal _ if every orbit is dense .",

    "of course , these values are a.e .  constant if the measure is ergodic ; they may however depend on the measure .",
    "since a minimal homeomorphism may have uncountably many ergodic measures , theorem  [ t.main ] is not a consequence of the aforementioned result of @xcite .",
    "actually , the theorem was proved first in the case of @xmath0-cocycles in @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the minimality assumption is necessary for the validity of theorem  [ t.main ] ; it is easy to see that it can not be replaced e.g.  by transitivity .",
    "an example from @xcite shows that it is not sufficient to assume that @xmath5 has a unique minimal set .",
    "as in @xcite , we do not know whether the assumption that @xmath1 has finite dimension is actually necessary .",
    "an immediate consequence of the [ t.main ] is that for the generic automorphism , the oseledets splitting varies continuously .",
    "another consequence is that the time needed to see a definite separation between expansion rates along different oseledets subbundles is uniform .",
    "all these properties are much stronger than those provided by the oseledets theorem itself .",

    "putting these results together with [ t.main ] , it is possible to show the following :    [ t.dense_conf ] let @xmath4 be a minimal homeomorphism of a compact space @xmath1 of finite dimension , and let @xmath2 be a vector bundle over @xmath1 .",

    "moreover , this metric is adapted in the sense of @xcite .",
    "this result should be useful to study the following question : _ when can an automorphism @xmath12 be approximated by another with a nontrivial dominated splitting ? _      to prove theorem  [ t.main ] we used ideas and tools developed in @xcite to deal with the @xmath0 case .",
    "the basic strategy for mixing different expansion rates on higher dimensions is similar to that from @xcite , but using a characterization of domination from @xcite to find the suitable places to perturb . as in @xcite",
    ", the desired residual set is obtained as the set of continuity points of some semicontinuous function .    despite these overlaps , dealing simultaneously with several lyapunov exponents with respect to all invariant measures presented substantial new difficulties .",
    "we introduce an especially convenient semicontinuous function @xmath43 to measure quasiconformal distortion .",
    "this function was in fact suggested by some ideas from @xcite .",
    "the proof that the mixing mechanism actually produces a discontinuity of @xmath43 is also more delicate : it is essential not to be too greedy , and instead attack only the points on @xmath1 where the distortion is comparatively large .",
    "this is explained in [ ss.proof_main_lemma ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in [ s.initial ] we explain several preliminaries , and reduce the proof of to a result ( [ l.discontinuity ] ) on the existence of discontinuities of a certain function ( related to @xmath43 ) .    in [ s.segment ]",
    "we prove [ l.main ] , which produces the suitable perturbations along a segment of orbit .    in [ s.global ]",
    "we explain how to patch those local perturbations to prove [ l.discontinuity ] and therefore conclude .",

    "we have to assure ourselves that this drop is a significant one .",
    "similar strategies are used in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , the short perturbative subsegment",
    "is chosen basically halfway along the segment ; that this is a suitable position for perturbation is a consequence of oseledets theorem . in the minimal @xmath0 situation",
    "considered in @xcite , the middle position is not necessarily the most convenient one , but nevertheless it is easy to see that there exists a suitable position that produces a big drop .",
    "the considerations here are more delicate .",
    "we actually apply [ l.moving spaces , l.bv ] to the index @xmath309 which maximizes the half - gap @xmath310 and so is likely to produce a bigger drop in the @xmath112-area ( see [ fig.areas ] ) .",
    "suppose we break @xmath311 into left and right unperturbed subsegments ( disregarding the short middle term ) .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we choose the breaking point so that @xmath312",
    ". then we need to estimate the drop in @xmath112 . by subadditivity ,",
    "@xmath313 for each @xmath109 . on the other hand , since the lengths @xmath22 and @xmath314 of @xmath244 and @xmath252 are big , the values @xmath315 and @xmath316 are essentially bounded by @xmath317 .",
    "we can assume that for the point @xmath30 under consideration , the value @xmath318 is already sufficiently close to @xmath317 , because otherwise no perturbation is needed .",
    "it follows that @xmath319 and therefore @xmath320 for each @xmath109 .",
    "this allows us to recover an `` oseledets - like '' situation and carry on the estimates easily .",
    "the actual argument is more subtle , because in order to prove the we need to consider points @xmath30 such that @xmath318 is close , but not extremely close , to @xmath317 .",
    "we proceed with the formal proof .",
    "let @xmath321 be given by [ l.bobo ] , and define @xmath322 let @xmath12 be without nontrivial dominated splitting , and let @xmath34 . take a positive number @xmath323 ; how small it needs to be will become apparent along the proof .    for each @xmath324 ,",
    "we apply [ l.moving spaces ] and thus obtain an integer @xmath325 and a nonempty open set @xmath326 with the following property : along segments of orbits of length @xmath325 starting from @xmath327 , we can @xmath40-perturb the linear maps in order to make any given @xmath109-dimensional space intersect any given @xmath328-dimensional space .",

    "since the functions @xmath385 and @xmath112 are invariant under composition with homothecies , we can assume for simplicity that @xmath386 , i.e. , @xmath387 , for all the linear maps involved .",
