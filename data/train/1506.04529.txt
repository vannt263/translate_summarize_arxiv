    "anisotropic lattices are a standard tool in modern lattice calculations , and have been used in the study of a large variety of problems , ranging from glueball  @xcite and light - hadron  @xcite spectroscopy to properties of qcd at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations in four dimensions usually employ lattices with 3 + 1 anisotropy , i.e. , only one of the lattice spacings is different from the others , while more general anisotropy classes have received much less attention  @xcite , due to the increasing difficulty in the scale setting procedure .",
    "indeed , for anisotropy classes other than 3 + 1 , one needs to appropriately tune the action in order to recover lorentz invariance in the continuum , already at the pure - gauge theory level",
    ". a better understanding of these more general anisotropy classes would be useful , since they provide a more flexible setting for varying length scales independently in different directions .",
    "this would allow , for example , to enlarge the range of momenta accessible to lattice calculation at a reasonable computational cost , by improving the resolution only in a single spatial direction  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic lattices provide , quite obviously , the natural setting for the nonperturbative study of anisotropic systems , also beyond numerical applications .",
    "an interesting case is that of longitudinally rescaled actions , which in recent years have been considered in the context of high - energy scattering in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of refs .",
    "@xcite is to perform a rescaling of the longitudinal directions , which appear highly lorentz - contracted in a high - energy scattering process , in order to derive an effective action starting from qcd . in refs .",
    "@xcite only the classically rescaled action was considered , while the important effect of quantum corrections was studied later in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the framework of wilsonian anisotropic renormalisation in the continuum . in this context , the use of a gauge - invariant , anisotropic lattice regularisation could lead to more insight in the structure of quantum corrections .",
    "the relevant anisotropy class here is 2 + 2 , with different lattice spacings in the longitudinal and in the transverse plane .",
    "this is also the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , although for different purposes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a classical anisotropic rescaling of the functional integral has been used to justify , on nonperturbative grounds , the analytic continuation from euclidean to minkowski space , required to obtain physical results in the euclidean formulation  @xcite of the nonperturbative approach to soft high - energy scattering  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain a theoretical estimate of the leading energy dependence of hadronic total cross sections , resulting in fair agreement with experiments .",
    "as the analytic continuation plays a key role in this approach , it is important to establish its correctness going beyond the formal argument of ref .",
    "@xcite , which , as we have said above , is based only on a classical rescaling of the qcd action . to this end ,",
    "quantum corrections to the effective action must be included to prove that the necessary analyticity requirements are actually fulfilled .",
    "the relevant anisotropy class in this case is 2 + 1 + 1 , with different lattice spacings in the transverse plane and in the two longitudinal directions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform the renormalisation of a @xmath0 gauge theory regularised on a general anisotropic lattice , and to apply the results in the study of hadronic high - energy scattering through the approaches mentioned above . to avoid the complications related to the introduction of fermions on the lattice",
    ", we work here in the _ quenched _ approximation , i.e. , pure gauge theory .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sec : anis_ren ] we study renormalisation for a general anisotropic lattice regularisation , using the background field method on the lattice  @xcite . in section [ sec : ac ]",
    "we use the results in the context of the nonperturbative approach to soft high - energy scattering of refs .",
    "@xcite , refining the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite on the possibility of performing analytic continuation to euclidean space . in section [ sec:2dmodel ]",
    "we discuss the longitudinally rescaled actions of refs .",
    "@xcite , focussing on the representation of the @xmath0 gauge theory as a set of coupled two - dimensional principal chiral models .",
    "finally , section [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions and prospects .",
    "some technical details are discussed in the appendices .",
    "our aim is to renormalise the euclidean @xmath0 gauge theory regularised on a 4d orthogonal anisotropic lattice .",
    "more precisely , lattice points are located at @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are four orthogonal unit vectors , and the physical coordinates @xmath3 in euclidean space are @xmath4 , @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the lattice spacing in direction @xmath7 , with the dimensionless _ anisotropy parameters _ @xmath8 being the inverse ratios of @xmath9 to a reference length scale @xmath10 . and @xmath11 are obviously redundant , and some condition has to be imposed on @xmath11 to remove this redundancy .",
    "this notation is however convenient , as we treat all the directions on the same footing . ]",
    "consider the following wilson - like action , @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the usual plaquette variables built up with the link variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 with @xmath17 the coupling constant , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , are the _ plaquette coefficients _ , . ]",
    "@xmath20 it is straightforward to show that eq .",
    "yields the correct nave continuum limit upon identification of the continuum , physical gauge fields @xmath21 through @xmath22 as appropriate for an anisotropic lattice .",
    "the choice of plaquette coefficients @xmath18 is easily understood by noticing that @xmath23 is just the volume of an elementary cell , so that @xmath24 is the jacobian for the change of variables from isotropic to anisotropic coordinates , while @xmath25 is the area of the faces of an elementary cell lying in the @xmath26 plane .",
    "as is well known , divergencies appear in the continuum limit when taking into account quantum corrections .",
    "these divergencies need to be subtracted through a suitable renormalisation of the couplings in order to obtain a finite continuum theory . on the isotropic lattice , the symmetry under the unbroken hypercubic subgroup of @xmath27 guarantees that all the plaquette terms in the action need to be renormalised in the same way , so that a single redefinition of @xmath17 is sufficient to reabsorb the divergencies .",
    "the form of the action is therefore unchanged , and one recovers the full @xmath27 invariance in the continuum limit .    on a general anisotropic lattice this residual symmetry",
    "is broken , except for reflections through lattice hyperplanes , and so in general different terms will require a different renormalisation .",
    "since there are six different plaquette terms and only four lattice spacings , it will not be possible in the general case to reabsorb completely the quantum corrections into a redefinition of @xmath28 , keeping at the same time the same form of the tree - level action  @xcite . in turn",
    ", this implies that the continuum limit of eq .",
    "can not be made into an @xmath27-invariant theory by an appropriate , simple rescaling of the lattice spacings , since in the general case one will still find different coefficients for the six continuum field - strength terms . to recover @xmath27 invariance one must ensure that these coefficients are equal , and this requires that we take the action to be of the more general form @xmath29 where the couplings @xmath30 have to be properly tuned to yield a finite , @xmath27-invariant theory in the continuum limit .    the need for tuning comes , as we have said , from the fact that there are in general more couplings than anisotropy parameters .",
    "it is however easy to show that one has to tune at most only two combinations of the couplings to achieve restoration of @xmath27 invariance in the continuum limit , while the other four independent combinations can be interpreted as the coupling fixing the overall lattice scale , and renormalisations of the anisotropies @xmath31 . to see this ,",
    "let us remove the redundancy in the set @xmath11 by imposing the symmetric condition @xmath32 , thus defining @xmath10 in terms of the volume of an elementary cell .",
    "any other equivalent choice ( i.e. , giving the same @xmath9 ) is obtained by a simple global rescaling of @xmath11 and of @xmath10 .",
    "the six plaquette terms can be grouped in pairs of `` complementary '' @xmath33 and @xmath34 plaquettes , i.e. , @xmath35 , etc . , which we denote as @xmath36 .",
    "it is also easily noticed that @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests to parameterise @xmath39 as follows , @xmath40 as there are two redundant parameters , we choose to fix @xmath41 , so that our condition on @xmath11 is not renormalised , is defined to be one of the lattice spacings by choosing @xmath42 for some @xmath7 , then it is convenient to choose @xmath43 .",
    "the new values of @xmath44 are obtained from those corresponding to the symmetric condition by replacing @xmath45 , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 are unaffected . ] and @xmath48 . in this way @xmath47 , @xmath49 and @xmath46 are unambiguously defined and can be obtained from @xmath39 as follows , @xmath50^{{\\frac{1}{3}}}\\,.\\ ] ] this makes it explicit that the restoration or not of @xmath27 invariance in the continuum depends only on the values of the ratios of the couplings @xmath39 .",
    "defining now the bare anisotropy parameters @xmath51 , and the bare plaquette coefficients @xmath52 , one can rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath53\\,.\\ ] ] this equation shows that to obtain an @xmath27-invariant theory in the continuum limit , one can choose freely @xmath54 ( up to a constraint to remove the redundancy ) , and then tune only the two independent ratios of @xmath46 to the appropriate values .",
    "the physical anisotropy parameters @xmath28 are related to the bare ones through the renormalisation @xmath55 , and can be measured _",
    "ex post_.    using the parameterisation eq .  , it is possible to set up a rather simple nonperturbative scheme to achieve restoration of @xmath27 invariance in the continuum , for an arbitrary choice of bare anisotropy parameters .",
    "the basic idea is to impose that the string tension , determined from the asymptotic behaviour of large rectangular @xmath56 on - axis wilson loops @xmath57 , is the same for all pairs of directions @xmath58 .",
    "denoting with @xmath59 the physical ( dimensionful ) string tension , this amounts to impose @xmath60 , for all pairs of different @xmath58 . multiplying the relations for @xmath61 and its `` complementary '' @xmath62",
    ", one obtains the following consistency conditions , @xmath63 which have to be imposed to recover @xmath27 invariance .",
    "this can be done without any prior knowledge of the physical @xmath64 , and requires only to properly tune two of the coefficients @xmath46 ( the third one being constrained by our choice @xmath48 ) .",
    "having done this , the anisotropies can then be obtained from the ratio @xmath65 for any @xmath66 .",
    "imposing @xmath67 one can explicitly determine all @xmath28 s , and set the lattice scale @xmath10 from the relation @xmath68 . while the string tension is known not to be the best observable for setting the physical scale , nevertheless it could be useful for the tuning , as it can be determined to high precision by means of multilevel algorithms  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the tuning of two parameters is only required when all the lattice spacings are different : if at least a pair of lattice spacings are equal , one easily sees that only one parameter has to be tuned .      from the discussion above",
    ", we see that our task is to find the relations among the couplings @xmath39 that will lead to an @xmath27-invariant theory in the continuum limit .",
    "we will study this problem to lowest order in perturbation theory , making use of the background field method  @xcite on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it allows to keep an exact gauge invariance on the lattice after gauge fixing , which greatly simplifies the calculations .",
    "a full account on the background field method can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we briefly recall the main points of the method to fix the notation .",
    "the first step is to introduce a background field @xmath69 in the gauge action as follows , @xmath70 \\equiv s_{\\rm lat}[vu^{(c ) } ] \\,,\\ ] ] where we now denote with @xmath71 the gauge links , to be integrated over with the usual haar measure . as a consequence of the gauge invariance of @xmath72 , the action @xmath73 is invariant under the _ background gauge transformation _",
    "@xmath74 with @xmath75 , as well as under the following gauge transformation of @xmath71 alone , @xmath76 the integration measure is also obviously invariant under the transformations eqs .   and .",
    "one then proceeds to set up perturbation theory in the usual way , setting @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the generators of @xmath0 in the fundamental representation , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "one then changes variables of integration to @xmath83 , expressing the jacobian as a contribution @xmath84 $ ] to the action .",
    "notice that powers of @xmath17 and @xmath10 are chosen so that @xmath83 is dimensionless , while @xmath85 has dimensions of mass .",
    "this distinction is convenient for book - keeping purposes  @xcite .    under the transformation",
    ", the background field @xmath85 transforms as a gauge field , while the `` quantum '' field @xmath83 transforms as a matter field in the adjoint representation .",
    "the symmetry under the gauge transformation eq .",
    "requires to impose a gauge condition on @xmath83 to define the corresponding propagator .",
    "this is done _  la _ faddeev  popov , adding a gauge - fixing term to the action , together with the corresponding ghost term .",
    "the key point is that there is an appropriate choice of gauge , called the _ background field gauge _ ,",
    "for which the gauge - fixing and the ghost terms are invariant under the background gauge transformation eq .  .",
