    "observations of distant galaxies have advanced rapidly as a result of the keck telescope , which because of its large collecting area is sensitive to faint objects . but despite extensive searches , only four galaxies of redshift @xmath4 have as yet been identified spectroscopically using the keck telescope ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ; hu , mcmahon , & cowie 1998 ; weymann et al .",
    "1998 ; spinrad et al .",
    "it has proven extremely difficult to identify high - redshift galaxies solely based on ground - based spectroscopy , because ( 1 ) galaxies lack prominent narrow - band features at rest - frame ultraviolet wavelengths ( which are redshifted to observed - frame optical or infrared wavelengths ) and ( 2 ) background sky light is the dominant source of noise at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we have sought to identify distant galaxies in very deep slitless spectroscopy observations acquired by stis on board hst , by combining a new spectrum extraction technique with photometric and spectroscopic analysis techniques .",
    "our analysis was designed to identify redshifts of galaxies in the slitless data by means of broad - band photometric techniques and to test these redshifts by identifying narrow - band emission , absorption , and continuum features in the same spectra . as a result of this analysis ,",
    "we obtained optimally extracted spectra and self - confirming redshift measurements for roughly 250 object , including a galaxy at @xmath0 , and 5 isolated emission - line objects .",
    "the very deep observations , obtained by hst using stis toward a region of sky flanking the hubble deep field , consisted of pairs of images : a direct image taken using no filter and a dispersed image taken using the g750l grating .",
    "additional observations consisted of only a direct image .",
    "the integration time of the direct images totaled 4.5 h over 82 exposures , and the integration time of the dispersed images totaled 13.5 h over 60 exposures .",
    "we summed the direct and dispersed images using conventional image processing techniques .",
    "the summed image covers a sky area of @xmath5 arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the summed direct and dispersed images is @xmath7 arcsec , the @xmath8 detection threshold of the summed direct image is @xmath9 mag arcsec@xmath10 , and the @xmath8 detection threshold of the summed dispersed image at @xmath11   is @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 cm@xmath10 @xmath13 arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "the spectrum extraction of the dispersed image is made especially difficult because the image of the field is covered by light of faint galaxies , which when dispersed overlaps in the spatial direction and is blurred in the spectral direction .",
    "to spatially deblend and spectrally deconvolve the spectra , we used the summed direct image to determine not only the exact object locations but also the exact two - dimensional spatial profiles of the spectra on the summed dispersed image .",
    "the spatial profiles of these objects are crucial because ( 1 ) they provide the `` weights '' needed to optimally extract the spectra , ( 2 ) they provide the models needed to deblend the overlapping spectra and determine the background sky level , and ( 3 ) they provide the spectral templates needed to optimally deconvolve the spectral blurring of extended objects .    first , we identified objects in the summed direct image , using the sextractor program of bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) .",
    "roughly 250 objects were identified in the summed direct image .",
    "next , we modeled each pixel @xmath15 of the summed dispersed image as a linear sum of contributions from ( 1 ) relevant portions of all overlapping neighboring objects and ( 2 ) background sky : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are spectral elements of the @xmath18th object , @xmath19 is the object position along the spectral direction in the direct image , @xmath20 is the constant offset between object position and the starting pixel of the spectrum along the spectral direction , @xmath21 is the object profile measured in the direct image , and @xmath22 is the model sky ( for which we found that a fourth order polynomial is necessary and sufficient ) .",
    "we treated the problem as a @xmath23 minimization problem , where the data were the pixel values of the summed dispersed image , the model was a linear sum of appropriate elements of the spatial profiles , and the parameters of the model were values of the spectral pixels .",
    "the @xmath23 is written @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the flux measurement and @xmath26 is the 1-@xmath27 error at pixel @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we minimized @xmath23 between the model and the data with respect to the model parameters and obtained estimates of all model parameters simultaneously to form one - dimensional spectra .",
    "the model parameters included roughly 250,000 `` object '' parameters ( from roughly 1000 spectral pixels each of roughly 250 objects ) and four thousand more `` sky '' parameters .",
    "as a zeroth order approximation , the spectral elements of individual objects are independent of each other , and so we can solve the minimum @xmath23 separately for individual columns .",
    "the @xmath23 for column @xmath28 is @xmath29 now we only need to solve for approximately 250 spectral elements @xmath17 and @xmath30 sky paremeters @xmath31 ( here @xmath32 ) that give the minimum @xmath33 each time and repeat the calculation for all columns .",
    "errors of the model parameters were obtained by solving the hessian matrix at the minimum @xmath33 .",
    "this new spectrum extraction method is superior to other extraction methods in many ways .",
    "first , the method employs optimal weights for the spectral extraction .",
    "second , the method deblends the spectra .",
    "third , the method determines the precise sky background . because the dispersed image is covered by light of extremely faint galaxies over most of its area , the spatial templates are needed to find the rare `` clear '' regions of sky background between the object spectra . finally , the method estimates errors correctly by taking into account the correlation between spectral elements of overlapping objects .    as a result of the spectrum extraction technique ,",
    "we obtain 250 optimally extracted spectra for redshift analysis . to determine redshifts of extremely faint galaxies in stis slitless spectra , we first measured photometric redshifts by means of a redshift likelihood technique ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ) and verified these redshifts by identifying narrow - band emission , absorption , and continuum features in the same spectra .",
    "the goal is to obtain self - confirming photometric redshift estimates .",
    "the new spectrum extraction technique adopts object profiles determined from the direct image as model templates to determine the exact sky and to optimally extract spectra from the dispersed image .",
    "the analysis involves complicated smoothing and deblending .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to expect that the noise characteristics may have been highly skewed in the extracted spectra and do not follow a normal distribution any more . to proceed with discussions on the significance of detections of any spectral features , it is indeed necessary for us to first understand the noise characteristics of the final products of the analysis .    to examine the noise characteristics , we form a histogram of pixel values of about 15 rows randomly chosen from the residual image .",
    "the histogram is shown in figure 1 , in which we also plot the best - fit gaussian distribution with the full width at half maximum of 0.004 .",
    "the corresponding 1-@xmath27 deviation is 0.0017 , which is slightly larger than the 1-@xmath27 deviation measured in the dispersed image ( 0.0015 ) .",
    "the fact that the noise in the residual image follows a gaussian distribution with a slightly larger 1-@xmath27 deviation has secured our subsequent reference to a normal noise distribution for any further statistical analysis .",
    "in addition to the 250 objects observed in the direct image , which included a galaxy at @xmath0 , we identified five isolated emission lines in the dispersed image that were not accounted for by objects detected in the direct image .",
    "the @xmath0 galaxy is the most distant galaxy that has yet been spectroscopically identified .",
    "detailed analysis has been presented elsewhere ( chen , lanzetta , & pascarelle 1999 ) . here",
    "we focus on the five emission - line objects .    to objectively identify these isolated emission lines",
    ", we applied the sextractor program to the smoothed dispersed image , setting the detection threshold such that nothing was detected in the negative of the image .",
    "next , we removed the lines that correspond to objects identified in the direct image . consequently , five isolated emission lines remained in the dispersed image .",
    "the nature of these isolated emission lines is uncertain because of the ambiguities in the wavelength determination .",
    "it is impossible to determine the wavelengths and therefore to calibrate the fluxes for these lines without first knowing their positions on the sky .",
    "we show in figure 2 that the 1-@xmath27 flux threshold of an unresolved emission line in the dispersed image may vary with wavelength by as much as a factor of four across the entire spectral range .",
    "however , given the 1-@xmath27 single pixel detection threshold of the direct image , @xmath9 mag arcsec@xmath10 , we can work out the 3-@xmath27 lower limit to the observed equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of wavelength for these isolated emission lines .",
    "the dot - dashed curve in figure 2 indicates the 3-@xmath27 lower limit to the observed ew of an unresolved line detected at a 3-@xmath27 significance level in the dispersed image versus wavelength .",
    "the actual observed ew limit as a function of wavelength for a particular line can be obtained by scaling the dot - dashed curve to the significance of the line detection .",
    "according to the ew limits shown in figure 2 , the observed five emission lines are most likely to be high - redshift  emission lines , rather than low - redshift [ oii ] or h@xmath34 lines .",
    "the sensitivity curve shown in figure 2 also indicates that the stis observations are more sensitive to faint emission - line galaxies than existing deep narrowband surveys from the ground ( e.g. hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ) .",
    "if these lines are high - redshift  emission lines , the statistics drawn from this observation may place a strong constraint on the number density of high - redshift  emission line galaxies and the star formation rate density contributed by this population .",
    "however , the study has been made extremely difficult because of the ambiguities in the wavelength ( and therefore redshift ) determination .    to solve this problem",
    ", we applied a likelihood analysis to the observed emission lines , assuming that all five emission lines are high - redshift   lines and that the number density of these lines is well represented by a simple @xmath1-function luminosity function , @xmath35 the likelihood analysis returns a best - fit characteristic luminosity @xmath36 .",
    "given the fact that five lines were detected , we find the number density to be @xmath37 .    on the basis of",
    "the simple @xmath1-function galaxy luminosity function determined for the observed  emission line objects , we estimated the statistical properties of the galaxy population .",
    "first , we calculated the mean redshift of the observed lines and found @xmath38 .",
    "second , we estimated the star formation rate density , using the relationship between h@xmath34 luminosity and star formation rate of madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 ) and assuming case b recombination , where /h@xmath39 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "it turns out that the star formation rate density of   emission line galaxies is @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( without correction for extinction ) .",
    "this is about 15% of the star formation rate density measured by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the lyman break galaxies at @xmath42 , suggesting that galaxies exhibiting the   emission feature represent only a small portion of the whole galaxy population at high redshifts .",
    "we therefore conclude that high - redshift galaxies are more efficiently and objectively identified using broad - band photometric rather than narrow - band imaging / spectroscopic techniques .",
    "finally , we calculated the surface density of  emission line galaxies expected in observations of a given sensitivity . figure 3 shows that we expect to detect no more that five  emission line galaxies per arcmin@xmath6 at @xmath42 that are stronger than @xmath43 and no more than 10  emission line galaxies per arcmin@xmath6 at @xmath44 that are stronger than @xmath45 ."
