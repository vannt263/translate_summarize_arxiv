    "for a knot @xmath3 in the @xmath4-sphere @xmath5 , there is a connected compact embedded surface @xmath6 in @xmath5 whose boundary is @xmath3 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath6 can be chosen to be orientable , and then it is called a seifert surface for @xmath3 .",
    "the genus @xmath7 of @xmath3 is the minimal number of genera of all seifert surfaces for @xmath3 .",
    "thus the unknot is the only knot of genus zero .    on the other hand , we can choose the above @xmath6 to be non - orientable , for example , by adding a half - twisted band to a seifert surface .",

    "we call @xmath8 the crosscap number because it counts the number of ` crosscap summands ' in the closed surface obtained by capping off a non - orientable spanning surface with a disk , which is well known to be a connected sum of projective planes . in the literature , a crosscap number is also called a non - orientable genus @xcite . for a non - trivial knot @xmath3 ,",
    "if a non - orientable spanning surface @xmath6 satisfies @xmath11 , then @xmath6 is called a _",

    "any minimal genus seifert surface becomes a non - orientable spanning surface for the same knot if we attach a small half - twisted band as above , and hence we have an obvious inequality @xmath12",
    ". there are only a few results about crosscap numbers of knots .",
    "clark @xcite introduced the notion of crosscap number and pointed out that @xmath13 if and only if @xmath3 is a @xmath0-cabled knot .",

    "the crosscap numbers of torus knots are completely determined .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the crosscap numbers of @xmath0-bridge knots , which form a special but important class of knots . for @xmath0-bridge knots , hatcher and",
