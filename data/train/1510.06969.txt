    "recently , physical layer security in the optical layer has gained significant traction .",
    "security treats in optical networks generally impact the reliability of optical transmission . in the case of fiber cut and tapping attacks",
    ", an attacker has physical access to network equipment and can disrupt the operation .",
    "the interchannel eavesdropping and jamming , on the other hand , can be lunched from a legitimately acquired optical channel @xcite . in addition",
    ", an attacker can exploit the crosstalk effects and launch both jamming and eavesdropping attacks . for a jamming attack",
    ", the attacker injects a high - power jamming signal ( @xmath0 db above other , legitimate signals ) into the acquired lightpath inducing a severe interference effect for transmission channel on the fiber link , thus degrading the signal quality . at the same time",
    ", the attacker can collect the leakage signals from adjacent lightpaths and extracts the secret information by amplifying the collected signals @xcite .",
    "a number of effective solutions against jamming and eavesdropping attacks propose encryption and optimization of lightpath disjointness ; encryptions can effectively protect against eavesdropping , and path disjointness can make eavesdropping more difficult .",
    "one of the prospective methods used in networks other than optical includes linear network coding ( lnc ) .",
    "lnc can protect from both the jamming and eavesdropping .",
    "first , the source combines the original data with random information and designs a network code in such a way that only the receivers are able to decode the original packets .",
    "the nodes can only decode packets if they have received a sufficient number of linearly independent information vectors , which an eavesdropper might not be able to do .",
    "second , lnc is also an erasure coding technique and thus can protect the source message also from random errors , and errors injected by the wiretapper via jamming attacks @xcite .",
    "lnc can provide the so - called _ r - secure coding , _",
    "whereby a wiretapper can eavesdrop any @xmath1 channels in the network , without gaining any knowledge about the source message .        in this paper",
    ", we study the effectiveness of lnc to balance the demands of reliable transmission and security in optical networks . to this end , we combine the coding process with parallelization of the source data stream , matching the generation size to the number of paths allocated in the optical network . in our approach , a serial data stream from the source",
    "is parallelized into @xmath2 lightpaths , whereby @xmath3 represents number of data blocks of the original ( secret ) data and @xmath1 is a number of redundancies ( random data sources ) generated at the source to protect a secret data against wiretap security attacks .",
    "in addition , we study how the path selection in the optical layer impacts the security overall .",
    "specifically , we study two path selection methods in circuit switched ( wdm ) transmission networks : 1 ) optimized paths , and 2 ) arbitrarily available paths .",
    "the results show that lnc and a random path selection method can effectively balance and improve both the security and reliability of optical transmission .",
    "fig .  [ networkm ] shows our reference network model .",
    "the data traffic is modeled as a binary sequence , whereby original data can be decomposed into _",
    "m data blocks _ of the same length .",
    "every data block is then parallelized and distributed in a round robin fashion to @xmath3 sub - flows at the source nodes .",
    "this is akin to the high speed ethernet systems with multiple lane distribution ( mld ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , in an mld ethernet network an incoming serial flow consists of multiple 66b data blocks distributed over multiple lanes , where , for instance , @xmath4 lanes of @xmath5 each can be utilized to reach the total transmission rate of @xmath6 @xcite .    without loss of generality , and for simplicity ,",
    "[ networkm ] illustrates how lnc is performed at the end - system ,",
    "i.e. , at source and destination , and the assumption is that there is no coding in the middle of the network .",
    "the linear coding process is performed over a field @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the field size . here",
    ", each data block is decomposed into _ symbols _ , whereby each symbol has the same length of @xmath9 bits .",
    "symbols encoded with the same set of coding coefficients are referred to as a _ generation _ , while the number of original information symbols @xmath3 encoded with the same set of coding coefficients defines the _ generation size_. here , new coding coefficients are utilized for each new set of data blocks from @xmath3 parallel sub - flows .",
    "thus , the source data of @xmath10 data blocks result in @xmath11 generations .    in this network system , we assume that the number of outgoing encoded flows @xmath12 , corresponding to the number of required optical paths @xmath13 over optical network , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the source sends the encoded data over @xmath13 out of all @xmath15 available paths in the network .",
    "generally , the number of outgoing encoded flows @xmath12 can be equal to or larger than number of incoming flows @xmath3 , @xmath16 , which is of special importance here .",
    "we refer to @xmath17 symbols sent as _",
    "redundancy_. thus , a reliable transmission of one generation is possible since only @xmath3 out of @xmath2 arbitrary encoded symbols / data blocks from the same generation of any of @xmath12 paths are required for a successful decoding at the receiver .",
    "this provides protection against jamming attacks , when an attacker disrupt only @xmath18 data blocks from each generation . at the same time",
    ", a eavesdropping can be successfully defeated by lnc due to the fact that a wiretapper requires at least @xmath3 encoded data blocks from the same generation and knowledge about coding coefficients to recover a secret data .",
    "a final feature in our reference network is the path selection .",
    "we assume that a network provides @xmath19 paths between source and destination , while at most @xmath15 optical paths are available ( i.e. , not blocked ) for a transmission request . for a successful data transfer , the choice of @xmath12 , @xmath20 paths in the network can be either optimal ( p - opt ) or arbitrary ( p - rnd ) .",
    "an optimization goal maybe to find @xmath12 shortest paths , with a minimal differential delay , or similar . to this end ,",
    "offline and online tools maybe necessary to calculate paths , such as ietf path computation element ( pce ) . on the other hand",
    ", any available path can be chosen for simplicity , or in absence of optimization tools .",
    "we study both methods and evaluate the benefits of path selection for security and reliability purposes , since depending on the location of the attacked edge , different path selection strategies will yield different performance .",
    "the network is represented as a directed and acyclic graph @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are vertex set and edge set , respectively .",
    "the source and destination nodes are denoted as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "a distinction is made between incoming and outgoing edges of an arbitrary node @xmath26 , which are denoted as a set @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . in our model , @xmath29 , if the optical switch supports @xmath30 input interfaces and each input interface @xmath31 provides @xmath32 different available wavelengths .",
    "similarly , we define the outgoing links as @xmath33 .",
    "an incoming link of a node @xmath34 is denoted as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "an outgoing link @xmath37 of a node @xmath34 is denoted as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "since each edge and each link on a wavelength @xmath40 in the network @xmath41 connects two nodes , e.g. @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we denote each edge as @xmath44 and each link as @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the refined definition of link is @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is capacity of edge measured in number of available wavelength for transmission . in other words ,",
    "each edge @xmath44 provides @xmath49 parallel links between nodes @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in the proposed system , the _ time unit ( tu )",
    "_ can be modeled as a discrete time based on the link capacity of the physical link and analyzed as transmission delay of one data block .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath50 , the incoming symbols at source node @xmath24 are generated by the processes @xmath51 on every edge @xmath31 considered as an incoming link of a node @xmath52 and denoted as @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the incoming symbols are encoded into symbols @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and sent out on each outgoing links @xmath37 of a node @xmath52 , @xmath58 . in this model ,",
    "the lnc encoder buffers incoming symbols from all incoming flows in parallel , and encodes the same with simple linear coding by using coding coefficients @xmath59 from the finite field @xmath7 . thus ,",

    "the data blocks are serialized and leave the decoding functional block in the correct order .",
    "the decoded information at time @xmath63 on edge @xmath31 in lnc decoder at the destination @xmath64 is modeled as @xcite : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is decoding interval and @xmath67 is decoding coefficients from the finite field @xmath7 .",

    "generally , only @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 optical paths are required for transmission , out of @xmath80 available paths . given the paths available ,",
    "every intermediate node @xmath34 can forward @xmath9 incoming data blocks from source over pre - configured set of @xmath81 available outgoing links .",

    "as previously mentioned , paths can be chosen from the set of all available paths in either arbitrary fashion , or , as it is more commonly the case , according to an optimization objective , for instance to minimize the differential delay .",

    "we analyzed and compared both the security capabilities against eavesdropping attacks , and reliability against jamming attacks .",
    "the results showed that lnc and parallel transmission over randomly selected paths significantly increases security against both eavesdropping and jamming compared with conventional wdm transmission , especially in the case , when a wiretapper has access to the shortest paths between source and destination .",
    "the combination of lnc and random path selection requires smaller number of redundancies to prevent jamming attacks .",
    "finally , we showed that in absence of physical layer security measures , conventional wdm transmission can lead to a _ catastrophic security treat _ , whereby an attacker can eavesdrop or to disrupt a whole secret data by accessing only one edge in a network .",
