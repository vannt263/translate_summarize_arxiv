    "the energy dependence of the `` diffractive '' central production of two - pions is quite different than the one for elastic scattering , single- or double - diffraction .",
    "this is due to the specificity of the reaction , where rather the subsystem energies dictate the energy dependence of the process .    at high energies we find a preference for the same hemisphere ( same - sign rapidity ) emission of @xmath56 and @xmath58 . at isr energies the same size emission is about 50 @xmath188 while at lhc energies the same hemisphere emission constitutes about 90 @xmath188 of all cases .    in the present analysis",
