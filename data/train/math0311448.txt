    "in a 1930 letter to o. klein ( @xcite letter 261 ) and in a survey to be given at the 8th solvay congress , planned for october 1939 , pauli suggested to describe the motion of a particle with rest mass @xmath5 , charge @xmath6 , spin @xmath7 and magnetic moment @xmath8 ( @xmath9 the bohr magneton ) in an electric field @xmath10 and a magnetic field @xmath11 by means of the operator @xmath12 a revised version of this review appeared in @xcite ( the relevant equation is ( 91 ) ) ; the original manuscript was not published until 1993 in @xcite pp .",
    "827901 .    if @xmath13 and @xmath14 , self - adjoint realisations of @xmath15 in @xmath16 are unitarily equivalent to the orthogonal sum of self - adjoint realisations of @xmath17 in @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the angular momentum quantum number .    the first mathematical treatment of the operators @xmath15 and @xmath1 is due to behncke @xcite",
    "he showed that @xmath1 has a unique self - adjoint realisation if @xmath20 for a very large class of potentials @xmath21 , including the coulomb potential @xmath22 for all values of the coupling constant @xmath23 ( for alternative proofs see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the case @xmath24 where it is well known that @xmath0 is essentially self - adjoint on its minimal domain if and only if @xmath25 . for larger values of @xmath26",
    "the singular end - point @xmath2 is in the limit - circle case ; but as long as @xmath27 one still has a distinguished self - adjoint realisation of @xmath0 defined by the requirement that functions in the domain behave like the principal solution of the eigenvalue equation of @xmath0 at @xmath2 .",
    "the location of the essential spectrum of @xmath1 is comparatively easy to determine and for a wide range of potentials , notably the coulomb potential , coincides with that of @xmath0 @xcite .    in the following , we normalise constants and write the coulomb hamiltonian as @xmath28 assuming @xmath29 .",
    "( the cases of positive @xmath4 and/or @xmath30 can be reduced to this situation by means of suitable unitary transformations . )",
    "the discrete spectrum of @xmath0 accumulates at the right end - point of the gap @xmath31 in the essential spectrum . since @xmath32 is a common core for @xmath0 and @xmath1 if ( and only if ) @xmath33 , @xmath1 converges to @xmath0 in the strong resolvent sense as @xmath34 ( @xcite thm viii.25(a ) ) , and as a consequence , the spectrum of @xmath1 can not expand in the limit @xmath34 for this range of the parameters @xmath35",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect ( and has been used as a basis for a perturbative calculation of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 ) that the point spectrum is stable in the limit @xmath34 in the sense that the eigenvalues of @xmath1 converge to those of @xmath0 , and each eigenvalue of @xmath0 is the limit of exactly one eigenvalue branch of @xmath1 .",
    "decoupling the eigenvalue equation of @xmath1 and using a comparison theorem for principal and non - principal solutions of second - order equations , behncke @xcite proved this stability for @xmath36 if @xmath37 , and @xmath38 if @xmath39 .",
    "he conjectured that @xmath40 might be sufficient in the latter case .",
    "( farther - reaching conjectures are to be found in @xcite p. 218",
    "seq . )    in the present paper , we study the convergence of the point spectrum of @xmath1 as @xmath30 tends to @xmath2 , for the whole parameter range for which a distinguished realisation of @xmath0 exists , i.e. for @xmath41 .",
    "we find a surprising qualitative difference in the limiting behaviour depending on the sign of @xmath3 . indeed , for negative @xmath3 , the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are exactly the limits of eigenvalues of @xmath1 for all values of @xmath4 . for positive @xmath3 , however ,",
    "there are ( finitely or infinitely many ) exceptional values @xmath42 in @xmath43 ; for @xmath44 , the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are still the limits of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , but with a shift of size @xmath45 in the eigenvalue numbers .",
    "this shift is reflected in the appearance of @xmath45 additional oscillations of the corresponding eigenfunction of @xmath1 , compared to that of @xmath0 , very close to the origin .",
    "it seems a delicate question to decide whether the number of exceptional values @xmath46 is finite or infinite ; in any case it grows beyond all bounds with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , we have the following results .",

    "the proof of these theorems is based on oscillation theory , in particular on an asymptotic study of the behaviour of the prfer angle of solutions of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath1 ( i.e. the solutions of equation ( [ eq:31 ] ) below ) as @xmath30 tends to @xmath2 .",
    "after rescaling @xmath62 , the mass term and spectral parameter are lower order terms in the limit and can be omitted in order to obtain an overview of solutions in the asymptotic regime near the origin .    the direction field of the resulting simplified equation ( [ eq:21 ] ) ( where @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , and hence the qualitative behaviour of its solutions , shows a fundamental difference depending on the sign of @xmath65 .    for negative @xmath3 ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the @xmath67 plane is divided into essentially horizontal strips in which the right - hand side of ( [ eq:21 ] ) is alternatingly positive and negative ( cf .",
    "[ fig : kapneg ] ) ; as a consequence , the distinguished angle @xmath68 which corresponds to an @xmath69 solution of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath1 , can not change by more than @xmath70 , and eventually tends towards an asymptotic value @xmath71 ( prop .",

    "the convergence becomes faster as @xmath34 .",
    "a stability argument ( lemma 3.2 , prop .",
    "3.3 ) then shows that for a certain point @xmath73 the influence of the previously neglected mass and spectral parameter terms can be controlled on @xmath74 , and that the solution of the full prfer equation ( [ eq:31 ] ) converges at that point to the prfer angle of the principal solution of the equation for @xmath24 .",
    "theorem 1.1 follows in view of the uniformity of this convergence with respect to the spectral parameter , and the fact that the presence of the anomalous magnetic moment does not significantly affect the behaviour of the solutions at @xmath75 .",
    "a curious phenomenon occurs , however , in the case of positive @xmath3 ( @xmath76 ) . for @xmath77 close to @xmath2 and for large @xmath77",
    ", one again has @xmath78-regions of opposite sign of the right - hand side of ( [ eq:21 ] ) , and hence of essential confinement of the solutions , and for large @xmath77 , the distinguished angle @xmath68 generically tends to the limit @xmath79 .",
    "in contrast to the previous situation , there is now a @xmath77-interval @xmath80 on which the right - hand side of ( [ eq:21 ] ) has no zeros and is strictly negative ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : kappos ] ) .    depending on @xmath4 , the size of this",
    "gap increases , vanishing as @xmath81 and becoming infinite as @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , one can show that the angle @xmath68 changes by several multiples of @xmath70 in this interval if @xmath83 is large enough ( prop .",
    "2.3 b ) , and hence will eventually converge to @xmath84 for some @xmath85 .",
    "thus the corresponding @xmath69 solution of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath1 will perform @xmath45 oscillations which are absent in the principal solution of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath0 , to which it however converges in phase at the point @xmath73 .",
    "theorem 1.2 then follows by way of the same stability argument as before ( lemma 3.2 , prop .",
    "as @xmath4 crosses the exceptional value , a transition of the asymptotic limit from @xmath84 to @xmath86 takes place . at @xmath87 ,",
    "the distinguished solution @xmath68 of the simplified equation ( [ eq:21 ] ) approaches an unstable limit as @xmath88 .",
    "the asymptotics of the solutions of the full prfer equation ( [ eq:31 ] ) appear to be a rather delicate matter in these cases , and the limiting behaviour of @xmath1 with @xmath87 remains an interesting open question .",
    "the basic analytical tool of the present paper is the study of the direction field of prfer and riccati type ordinary differential equations near a singularity ( for related earlier but simpler results see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the underlying comparison techniques are outlined in the appendix .",
    "in this section we consider the scaled and simplified equation @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) which arises from the prfer equation ( [ eq:31 ] ) equivalent to the eigenvalue equation for @xmath1 by omitting the @xmath93 @xmath94 terms after rescaling @xmath95 , which eliminates @xmath96 .",
