    "grb afterglow observations from x - rays to radio are generally well described by an external shock model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "however , model fits to the data still leave uncertainties in some of the parameters of the basic external shock model , and the bolometric luminosity depends on the poorly known gev range spectrum .",
    "the gamma ray large area space telescope glast @xcite is expected to be launched at the end of 2007 .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) covers the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev , while the gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) covers the range from 8 kev to 25 mev .",
    "the effective area of the lat is about 7 times larger than of the previous egret experiment at gev energies .",
    "agile was successfully launched on april 23 , 2007 , with an energy range of 30 mev to 50 gev @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that the higher photon statistics at gev energies of glast and agile will lead tighter constraints on the burst parameters , and an improved understanding of the gev afterglow spectra .",
    "glast may also be able to test recent developments in the understanding of grb afterglows , motivated by observations with the swift satellite ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one such development is the presence of a shallow decay phase of the x - ray afterglow , which may be due to refreshed shocks or late energy injection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or alternatively , it may be due to a change in time of the shock parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate here the effects of such new features on the expected gev spectrum .",
    "another question of great interest is how far can glast detect the mev to gev emission from such bursts , both in the basic model and the case where new features such as the above are present .",
    "this requires a detailed calculation of the gev spectrum as a function of time , with allowance for the changes in the dynamics implied by the injection , time variability , etc .",
    "the most conservative and widely considered mechanism for producing photons in this range is inverse compton ( ic ) scattering @xcite .",
    "another potential mechanism is hadronic cascades following proton acceleration @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is less well constrained , depending on the efficiency of proton acceleration ; it may be important in the prompt phase , but its parameter regime is small and generally outside of the afterglow parameter fit range @xcite , so it is not considered here .",
    "the maximum distance to which glast could detected grb afterglow was discussed by @xcite for the basic standard model , using a simplified analytical broken power - law approximation to the ic spectrum .",
    "this resulted in an ic - to - synchrotron peak - flux ratio which is overestimated by a factor @xmath0 , compared to a more accurate calculation , as we discuss in this paper .",
    "the usefulness of this ratio is that it allows simple predictions for the detectability in the gev range based on the lower energy measurements .",
    "here we discuss the validity of the simple analytical approximations , compared to more accurate numerical calculations of afterglow spectra at gev energies .    in @xmath1 [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the afterglow synchrotron - inverse compton model used for the numerical computations , a comparison between numerical and analytical approximations being given in the appendix . in @xmath1 [ sec : comp_detection ] we then present both numerical ic spectra and their appropriate analytical approximations , for the basic grb afterglow model and for the extended models including new swift - motivated elements such as energy injection or time - varying parameters , and evaluate their detectability as a function of redshift for the glast lat instrument and for agile .",
    "the afterglow of a grb , due to the external shock as it slows down in the external medium , produces synchrotron radiation in the x - ray to mev range , which is then inverse - compton upscattered into the gev - tev range @xcite",
    ". more specific calculation of the ic gev range are , e.g. those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "we describe the afterglow models , as usual , by the total isotropic energy @xmath2 ( for the case of energy injection see below ) , the external density @xmath3 , a jet opening half - angle @xmath4 , electron equipartition parameter @xmath5 , magnetic equipartition parameter @xmath6 and electron energy index @xmath7 .",
    "the other parameter of relevance in synchrotron - ic models is the scattering y - parameter which is defined as the luminosity ratio of ic to synchrotron , usually given by @xmath8 the initial lorentz factor @xmath9 of the burst is not needed as a parameter , since in the asymptotic blast wave regime the lorentz factor follows from the scaling law , @xmath10 our numerical calculations of the spectra and fluence curves use the basic synchrotron - ic equations given in @xcite , extending now to the gev range .",
    "we also consider in this range the spectral effects of the photon - photon opacity effects , which impose cutoffs depending on the spectrum and density of lower energy photons @xcite .",
    "we calculate the synchrotron - ic spectra of three different types of grb afterglow models , and evaluate their detectability with the glast large area telescope ( lat ) and with agile .",
    "these calculations improve on previous calculations , e.g. @xcite , in several respects .",
    "first , in the `` standard '' afterglow model such as used in @xcite , we use the exact ic spectrum instead of the broken power - law approximation , and the peak flux ratio is taken as f1 instead of f2 ( see appendix ) .",
    "second , we include the complete spectral regimes , not only the commonly used @xmath11 regimes where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the synchrotron self - absorption , injection , and cooling frequencies , respectively @xcite .",
    "this assures that the grb afterglows evolve through the correct regimes at all times .",
    "third , we consider swift - motivated additions to the standard afterglow model , such as a continued energy injection model , and a varying afterglow parameter model ( motivated by the presence of a shallow decay phase , and a high apparent radiative efficiency , see e.g. @xcite@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the details of the three models calculated are as follows .",
    "( a ) a standard afterglow model , with all parameters remaining constant during its evolution ( for a detailed description of this model , see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "( b ) a continuous energy injection model , which is a widely considered model to explain the shallow decay phase commonly seen in _ swift _ light curves . for this , we assume that the total kinetic energy increases over time with a power - law index , @xmath15 , before the break time @xmath16 seconds and the break time here is defined as the one when the shallow decay phase ends .",
    "fits to swift observations indicate a value @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "( c ) an evolving parameter model , which is an alternative model for explaining the shallow decay phase , based on the assumption that the electron equipartition parameter @xmath5 increases with the time as @xmath18 @xcite before the break time , as for the energy injection model .",
    "for all three models , we assume that they have the same parameters at late times , i.e. after the break time .",
    "since the flux has to be integrated over the observation time , we set the observation time to be one half of the final time of observation since the trigger ( e.g. if the observational data stop at @xmath19 seconds , the integration time is from @xmath20 seconds to @xmath19 seconds ) .",
    "this is consistent with the glast observation characteristics , as well as those of agile , in the point - source observing mode , where due to earth occultation , only about @xmath21 of the orbit time is used for the burst observation .    to determine the limiting redshift to which a burst can be detected",
    ", we calculate the instrumental fluence threshold as in @xcite , using the instrument characteristics of the glast lat and agile . for a flux sensitivity @xmath22 over an exposure time t and",
    "a point source observed over an effective observation time @xmath23 ( in seconds ) in an energy band centered around a photon energy @xmath24 , the fluence threshold is estimated as @xmath25 e t_{eff } $ ] where @xmath26 $ ] is the sensitivity for the effective observation time @xmath23 because the sensitivity scales as @xmath27 for the longer observations where the sensitivity is limited by the background . due to the occultation by the earth",
    ", the effective observation time @xmath23 is normally @xmath28 of the total orbit time , @xmath29 , for both glast and agile   ( or equivalent to the observation time after the burst ) , namely , @xmath30 where the observing efficiency @xmath31 is taken to be @xmath32 . hereafter ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , the small `` @xmath33 '' without the subscript refers to the observation time @xmath29 for simplicity . for glast",
    "we use the fluence threshold listed in the updated instrument performance documents . considering the integral sensitivity above 100 mev for glast lat to be @xmath34 for an effective observation time of one year in the sky - survey mode ,",
    "the fluence threshold is @xmath35 for the long - time observation in the sky - survey mode . for grb afterglows , in most cases",
    "glast will perform a pointed observation rather than the survey mode observation . in this mode",
    ", glast will keep the grb position always at the center of the lat field of view for as long as possible , and this will improve the sensitivity by a factor of 3 - 5 ( depending on where the grb lies with respect to the orbital plane ; an object which lies at the orbit pole will not be occulted by the earth and can be continuously observed ; j. mcenery 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , taking the improvement factor of 3 , the fluence threshold for a grb observation is @xmath36 for the long - time observation .",
    "the short - time fluence threshold can be defined by the criterion that at least 5 photons are collected and it depends on the effective area of the instrument which is around 6000 @xmath37 at 400 mev for glast lat , so it is @xmath38 ( the transition time when the short - time sensitivity and long - time sensitivity meet is @xmath39seconds ) .",
    "compared to the previous estimate of @xcite for the glast sensitivity , the short - time observation sensitivity here is roughly the same , but the long - time sensitivity has changed from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , increased by a factor of 3 .",
    "the energy range of agile   is somewhat lower than that of glast lat .",
    "its flux sensitivity above 100 mev is @xmath42 for a point - source observation over an effective period of @xmath43 seconds @xcite .",
    "thus , taking the observing efficiency @xmath32 , the fluence threshold can be estimated as @xmath44 at an average energy of 400 mev , where @xmath45 seconds is the exposure time corresponding to the given sensitivity .",
    "the fluence threshold is for the long - time observation .",
    "the shorter - time fluence threshold can be obtained similarly as above , @xmath46 mev @xmath47 where we have taken the effective area for agile to be 550 @xmath37 . in summary , for agile , the fluence threshold for the long - time observation ( i.e. , @xmath48 seconds ) is @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the short - time observation , the transition time being @xmath51 seconds .",
    "the initial nominal set of parameters for the standard model ( a ) used here are the same as for the standard model of @xcite : @xmath52 .",
    "an additional feature is that we also assume a jet opening half - angle @xmath53 , which does not affect the flux at early times .",
    "the other parameters are as for model ( a ) . for the injection model ( b )",
    ", the kinetic energy is assumed to increase following the relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is taken to be 0.5 based on the _ swift _ observation fits @xcite .",
    "for the model ( c ) with evolving parameters , we assumed @xmath5 to follow the relation @xmath56 @xcite , other parameters being the same as for model ( a ) . in the alternative models ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , either the kinetic energy or the electron equipartition parameter starts out with a smaller value as for ( a ) , but at late times end up with the same values as the standard model ( a ) .",
    "the transition time at which the energy injection or the @xmath5 evolution stops is set at @xmath16 seconds .",
    "fig [ fig : zhang_detection ] shows the results for the three models above , using the nominal set of parameters .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the partial fluence , defined here as the energy flux integrated over the time intervals [ @xmath57 , @xmath33 ] , as a function of @xmath33 , where the @xmath59 is the observation time counted after the trigger , adopting a nominal integration time @xmath60 throughout .",
    "the partial fluence curves shown correspond to the three different grb afterglow models , ( a ) the standard model , which is the same as the type ii grb model in @xcite ; ( b ) the energy injection model ; ( c ) the evolving parameter model . as can be seen in panel ( a ) , for a burst at a low redshift @xmath61 the gev emission from all three models can be detected by glast up to a time @xmath62 seconds ( the thick solid line indicates the glast lat sensitivity ) .",
    "note that the gev emission from the standard model is higher than that from the two other models .",
    "this is because all the models end up with the same energy and same parameters at late times , which means the injection starts with lower energy and the evolving parameter begins with the lower @xmath5 at the beginning .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the synchrotron and ic spectra of the standard model ( a ) at times @xmath63 and @xmath43 seconds . hereafter ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we always calculate the spectra at these time epoches .",
    "the fluxes around tev ( @xmath64 ev ) show the effects of inclusion of the photon - photon absorption within the sources .",
    "the upper curves are the flux without the @xmath65-@xmath65 absorption , and the lower curves are the flux after internal absorption . for this",
    "we have used the optical depth to internal @xmath65-@xmath65 interactions of equation ( 20 ) in @xcite . for the relatively low compactness parameters of the external afterglow shock discussed here ,",
    "the @xmath66 cutoff becomes important above @xmath67 tev energies , which is more of interest for ground - based air cherenkov telescope observations than for space detectors .",
    "the lower panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the redshift dependence of the gev emission for all three models , at @xmath68 and @xmath69 seconds . at @xmath68 seconds , the limiting redshift is @xmath70 for the standard model and @xmath71 for the other two models . at @xmath69 ,",
    "the limiting redshift is around @xmath72 for all the models .",
    "note that while the usual fluence is defined as flux integrated over the observation time since the trigger , which always increase with time , the partial fluences shown in panel ( a ) first increase and eventually decrease .",
    "this is because the afterglow flux decreases with time @xmath33 , and for the partial fluences the integration time starts at @xmath73 and ends at @xmath33 .",
    "this is done to check the limiting redshift to which afterglows can be detected for typical observations at different epochs @xmath33 with some uniform criterion for the integration time .",
    "the snapshot at the time @xmath74 seconds lies where the partial fluence is roughly flat in time , during which period the limiting redshift reaches its maximum ( although the partial fluence within the flat phase varies by a factor @xmath75 , the limiting redshift changes only slightly ) .",
    "other snapshot epochs were chosen around one decade earlier or later than the typical maximum redshift epoch .    in fig",
    "[ fig : normal_energy ] we consider an alternative set of parameters .",
    "the motivation for this is that the parameters of the standard model shown in figure [ fig : zhang_detection ] , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , differ somewhat from the statistical average values quoted for low - redshift grbs , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , e.g. @xcite . in order to check the sensitivity of the detectability of grbs to variations in these parameters , we perform the same calculation suing the values @xmath80 , and @xmath53 , the results being shown in fig ( [ fig : normal_energy ] ) . for these average parameters ,",
    "the limiting redshift is @xmath81 for all three grb models at @xmath82 seconds .    in fig",
    "[ fig : agile_glast ] we show the corresponding results for agile .",
    "this is a smaller - scale mission than glast , launched in april 23 , 2007 , and it is interesting to compare its detectability limits with those of glast .",
    "agile has a different energy range ( 30 mev to 50 gev ) and has a relatively narrower energy band than the glast lat ( 20 mev to 300 gev ) , as well as a lower effective area .",
    "thus the observed fluxes and partial fluences are expected to be lower for agile in contrast to glast .",
    "this is seen in panel ( a ) of fig [ fig : agile_glast ] .",
    "the dashed line is for agile , and the solid line is for glast , showing that it is hard for agile to detect a burst with the typical parameters at @xmath61 , while glast could detect it until around 2 days .",
    "panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of fig [ fig : agile_glast ] show the detectability with agile and with glast at different time epochs . at @xmath83 seconds",
    ", agile can detect bursts up to @xmath84 , and glast can detect bursts to @xmath81 . at the time @xmath85 seconds",
    ", the limiting redshifts are @xmath86 for agile , and @xmath87 for glast(same as fig [ fig : normal_energy ] ) , respectively . at @xmath88 seconds , the limiting redshift for agile is apparently well below @xmath89 , while the limiting redshift for glast can still reach up to @xmath90 .",
    "we see that the limiting redshift for agile drops relatively quickly with increasing observation times ; the short - time sensitivity for agile lasts around @xmath91 seconds , and after that the sensitivity drops quickly . for glast ,",
    "the short - time sensitivity lasts a longer time , @xmath92 seconds , and since the afterglow gev flux does nt change much for up to one day after the trigger , we do nt expect the sensitivity drop to have much of an effect on the limiting redshift for glast .    in figure",
    "[ fig : high_energy ] we probe the sensitivity of the detectabilty on the total kinetic energy of the burst , taking as an example the results for a value of @xmath93 .",
    "this is in the range of values derived for objects such as grb 990123 and grb 050904 , which may be called hyper - energetic grb . for the `` standard '' model case ( a ) with this energy",
    "( see upper panels of fig [ fig : high_energy ] ) we see that the limiting redshift for a glast detection has increased from @xmath81 to a value @xmath94 , assuming that the other parameters remain the same as in figure [ fig : normal_energy ] .",
    "thus , hyper - energetic bursts such as grb 990123 , at the observed redshift @xmath95 , should be detected by glast in the gev band , if they have the above conventional parameters .",
    "the other hyper - energetic object , grb 050904 , has a similar kinetic energy as grb 990123 , but it was at the much higher redshift @xmath96 , which appears out of range for glast .",
    "grb 050904 had the most complete set of observational data so far , covering from the bat band , through x - ray , to the optical / nir and to the radio band .",
    "thus a lot of effort has been invested in obtaining the best fitting parameters for this burst @xcite . taking the best fitting parameters from model ( b ) of @xcite ,",
    "our results here indicate that such grb 050904-like bursts could be detected by glast up to @xmath97 .",
    "there are two reasons for this relatively modest limiting redshift detectability by glast in this case : ( 1 ) the electron equipartition parameter derived is small , @xmath98 , which means only a fraction of the kinetic energy is radiated ; ( 2 ) the compton parameter parameter in the fast cooling case is relatively small , @xmath99 , which means that the energy lost via ic scattering is comparable to the energy lost via synchrotron radiation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : different_y ] we illustrate the sensitivity of the gev detectability on the value of the compton y parameter , showing the fluxes for two values , @xmath100 ( thin solid line ) and @xmath101 ( thin dashed dotted line ) in the fast cooling case .",
    "the parameters are same as the ones of the standard case ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : normal_energy ] , except for the electron equipartition parameter @xmath5 , which is @xmath102 for the @xmath100 case and @xmath77 for the @xmath101 case .",
    "one expects a higher flux over the glast energy band for the @xmath101 case because a larger compton parameter means that more energy goes into the gev band via the ic process , which can be seen from the spectrum on the lower panels .",
    "the limiting redshifts for the observation time @xmath85 seconds are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we have calculated the time - dependent gev synchrotron and inverse compton spectra for three generic types of grb afterglows which , at lower photon energies , have been used to interpret observations from the swift satellite and other ground - based facilities .",
    "these models include a standard , constant parameter afterglow model ( a ) , a model with late energy injection ( b ) and a model with varying parameters ( c ) .",
    "the spectra and the gev partial fluence curves in the gev range were used to estimate the detectability with glast and agile of bursts in these model categories , for various sets of parameters , at various epochs after the trigger and for various observation durations .",
    "these model spectra improve on previous calculations in several respects .",
    "in particular , in the past mainly constant parameter spectral models such as ( a ) were computed ; here we have extended these calculations over a broader range of input parameters , based on more recent information and statistics . models ( b ) and ( c ) have not been previously investigated in the gev range , and are motivated by recent swift results .",
    "the gev spectra discussed here were computed numerically , using the formalism described in @xcite .",
    "these are compared with previous analytical synchrotron - ic spectra of type ( a ) in the appendix .",
    "the detectability depends most obviously on the total burst energy @xmath105 and on the observation time @xmath33 and integration time @xmath106 , in addition to the other parameters such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 etc .",
    "e.g. , for bursts of the standard constant parameters ( a ) with the nominal values of the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath107 , the limiting detection redshift with glast for times @xmath83 s and @xmath74 s and integration time @xmath108 are roughly the same , @xmath109 ( fig . [",
    "fig : zhang_detection ] , panels b and c ) . for models with energy injection ( b ) or varying parameters ( c ) , where the final values of @xmath110 or @xmath5 reach the same value as for model ( a ) at a later time ,",
    "the detection threshold is somewhat lower for the shorter observation time , as seen in the same figure , panel ( c ) , since they start out weaker and build up to be comparable to ( a ) at later times .",
    "however , for the longer of the two observation times above , panel d , the limiting redshifts are the same . for the more standard values @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : normal_energy ] , panel b ) the limiting redshift for the constant parameter model ( a ) at @xmath113 s goes up to @xmath114 .    for agile",
    "the limiting redshifts are lower than for glast due to its lower effective area . for a standard burst model ( a ) with average parameter values @xmath111 , @xmath112 ,",
    "the limiting redshift is @xmath84 at an earlier observation time @xmath83 s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agile_glast ] , panel b ) , and @xmath115 at @xmath113 s. with agile bursts can only be detected at relatively early times , since the short - time sensitivity for agile ( where the sensitivity curve is flat in time ) only lasts , e.g. around @xmath116 seconds , versus @xmath117 s for glast for a burst at @xmath118 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agile_glast ] , panel a ) .",
    "a discrimination between models ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) based on gev measurements of the spectral evolution in time is possible in principle , as seen e.g. by comparing fig . 1 panel ( c ) , and fig .",
    "2 panels ( c ) and ( d ) . however , it will require good energy and time coverage , and extensive simulations over a wide range of parameter space , since changes in @xmath110 , @xmath119 ( e.g. figs .",
    "[ fig : high_energy ] and [ fig : different_y ] ) and the other afterglow parameters needs to be carefully disentangled .",
    "the limiting redshift naturally increases for larger values of @xmath110 .",
    "e.g. , for glast at an observation time @xmath120 s and a standard model ( a ) with @xmath121 , @xmath112 it is @xmath122 , while for a for a burst with the parameters of grb 050904 ( high @xmath110 but low @xmath5 ) it is @xmath123 .",
    "the limiting redshift also increases with the compton @xmath119 parameter , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : different_y ] , which reflects the fact that @xmath119 provides a measure of how much energy gets scattered into the gev range .",
    "besides the photon - photon absorption inside the source considered in our calculation , another interesting absorption process is the photon - photon absorption by the external cosmic infrared background radiation ( external absorption ) , which produces electron / positron pairs , and the resulting pairs can ic scatter the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , yielding a delayed mev - gev emission @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the external absorption does nt affect the limiting redshift much .",
    "@xcite show that , at @xmath124 , the absorption optical depth is @xmath125 for photons with an energy of 50 gev , and @xmath126 for photons of 300 gev .",
    "if we define the cutoff energy as the photon energy corresponding to an optical depth @xmath127 , the cutoff energy should shift to higher energies as one considers lower redshift , based on the numerical results in @xcite . assuming that ( 1 ) the photons above 50 gev is totally absorbed and there is no absorption below 50 gev ; ( 2 ) the cutoff energy is roughly the same within the redshift range considered ; and ( 3 ) the flux contribution from the delayed emission is ignored",
    ", we can conclude that in this case the flux observed by glast will be comparable to that observed by agile , because the effective observing band will have become similar for both instruments ( due to external absorption effectively cutting off the glast higher energy contribution ) .",
    "the limiting redshift for agile , as shown in fig [ fig : agile_glast ] , will be approximately the same for the case with external absorption as it is without , because absorption is important only above the agile band .",
    "the detectability estimates discussed here illustrate the sensitivity to different types of model assumptions in current synchrotron - inverse compton models , when one takes into account newer information gleaned from _",
    "swift_. calculations using simplified generic models show that around tens of _ swift_-detected grb per year will fall in the lat field of view @xcite during their prompt emission phase .",
    "considering the _ swift_-detected burst redshift distribution to imply a fraction of around @xmath128 below @xmath124 @xcite , we may roughly expect @xmath129 _",
    "swift_-burst prompt detections per year by glast .",
    "however , since the gev afterglows can last up to a day ( e.g. figs . 1 and 2 , panel a ) , glast may actually be able to observe more than this number of bursts in the afterglow , as opposed to the prompt phase .",

    "( a1 ) , @xcite  @xcite ) .    the f2 form ( equation [ [ eq : fkoba ] ] ) of the peak flux ratio , on the other hand ,",
    "is obtained by solving for @xmath137 from an equation ( [ eq : lum - ratio ] ) which relates the compton y parameter to the ratio of the luminosities produced by the first order ic and the synchrotron mechanisms @xcite , y = l_ic,1st / l_syn ~^ic_peak f_^ic(^ic_peak ) / _ peak f _ ( _ peak)=2_m _ c [ eq : lum - ratio ] where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the peak frequency of the ic and synchrotron spectra , respectively , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the peak fluxes corresponding to the ic and synchrotron peak frequencies . the corresponding analytical approximation to the ic spectrum is a simpler one than in the previous f1 case , in that it is a broken power law ( without the logarithmic corrections ) . in the low - frequency part of the ic spectrum , the broken power law is a good approximation to a numerically calculated ic spectrum .",
    "however , in the high - frequency part , the broken power - law analytical approximation under - estimates the numerical ic spectrum , which is larger ( and has a flatter spectral index ) than the broken power - law prediction ( this under - estimation is avoided in the f1 case by including the logarithmic correction ) . in the f2 pure broken power law case , therefore , in order to keep the frequency integrated total luminosity radiated by the ic mechanism equal to the numerically computed total ic luminosity , and to preserve the desirable simple broken power law shape ,",
    "an artificially boosted peak flux ratio is adopted , which leads to the same ic - to - synchrotron luminosity ratio .",
    "thus , while the total energetics are the same for both analytical approximations , the ic flux expected over the glast ( and agile ) energy range differ . whereas @xmath142 is simpler for quick estimates since it involves pure power laws and correctly describes the global energetics , @xmath143 with the logarithmic corrections to the power laws is preferable for more accurate gev spectral flux estimates"
