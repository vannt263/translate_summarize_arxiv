    "although a free particle on a half - line is one of the first problems commonly used in the standard courses of quantum mechanics , nevertheless the fact that the properties of the barrier preventing a particle from a motion on the whole line , and existing bound states are related to self - adjoint extensions of the energy operator @xcite is frequently unfamiliar even to working in the field of quantum theory .",
    "indeed , the analysis of self - adjointness of operators is usually treated as a boring mathematical task without any reference to concrete properties of the physical system under consideration .",
    "the motivation for this work was the clarification of details of the analysis of a quantum free particle on a pointed plane .",
    "indeed , the theory of such quantized system seems to be far from complete .",
    "this observation is supported by the very recent paper @xcite discussing a quantum free particle in two dimensions .",
    "first of all , the authors of @xcite seem to be unaware of the fact that they do not deal with the plane @xmath0 but the pointed plane i.e.  @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , in spite of the fact that one can find in @xcite the reference to the celebrated monograph @xcite on the self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators in hilbert space , the study of such extensions which is crucial for the identification of bound states of a quantum particle on a pointed plane is ignored in @xcite .    in this work the detailed analysis of a quantum free particle on a pointed plane is performed . as a matter of fact some aspects of a quantum particle moving on a pointed plane in a coulomb potential have been already investigated by schulte @xcite .",
    "the properties of the resolvent of the extensions of the hamiltonian were also discussed from the mathematical point of view @xcite ( _ nota bene _",
    "these works were not cited in @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of the problem performed in this paper is much more complete and physically oriented and we provide the new observations concerning the self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian for the quantum free particle on a pointed plane especially in the context of the properties of the angular momentum as well as the important role played by discrete symmetries such as the time - reversal one .",
    "in particular , we have determined the energy spectrum of the bound states and their explicit connection with the extension parameters by means of much more simple methods comparing with the advanced mathematical approaches applied in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of the hamiltonian of a free particle on the plane @xmath0 . in the coordinate representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 and the corresponding hilbert space is the space of square integrable functions @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to see that the von neumann deficiency index @xcite of @xmath4 is ( 0,0 ) so the hamiltonian is in this case essentially self - adjoint and positive definite as a sum of squares of the self - adjoint momentum operators .",
    "therefore it is translationaly invariant , its spectrum is @xmath5 ( the set of non negative real numbers ) and there are no bound states .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the topology of the plane : it is homogeneous and simply connected .",
    "a completely different situation arises if we extract from the plane @xmath0 a single point . in this case",
    "the translational invariance is lost and the pointed plane @xmath6 is infinitely connected i.e. its fundamental group is infinite cyclic group .",
    "as shown in this work , this fact has dramatic consequences for quantum mechanics on @xmath7 . now",
    "the most natural coordinates for the study of the case with the pointed plane @xmath7 are the polar coordinates .",
    "the origin \\{0,0 } is identified with the hole in @xmath7 .",
    "we stress that in the polar coordinates the origin is a singular point ( the jacobian is going to 0 when @xmath8 ) , of course this is no problem for the pointed plane @xmath7 where this point is extracted",
    ". however , this can be a source of misinterpretations when polar coordinates are applied to the usual plane @xmath0 , because in such a case we have a `` hidden '' extraction of the origin .",
    "the hamiltonian for a free particle on the pointed plane @xmath7 written in the polar coordinates takes the form @xmath9 we designate the corresponding carrier hilbert space of the square integrable functions on @xmath7 by @xmath10 .",
    "this space can be represented as the natural tensor product of the form @xmath11 where the former is the hilbert space of square integrable functions ( with respect to the measure @xmath12 ) on the half - axis @xmath5 whereas @xmath13 denote a hilbert space of the square integrable functions on a circle @xmath14 .",
    "we discuss the structure of @xmath13 in the next section . in view of the tensor product structure of the hilbert space",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath15.\\ ] ] therefore to analyze the problem of self - adjointness of @xmath16 , we should proceed in two steps :    ( a ) : :    consider the realizations of the plane rotation group    @xmath17 and discuss the self - adjointness of    @xmath18 in    the corresponding space @xmath13 .",
    "( b ) : :    find the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath16 using the    tensor product decomposition of @xmath16 .",
    "let us start with discussion of the hilbert space representation of the rotations on @xmath14 .",
    "bearing in mind an important role of the rotational invariance in the analysis of the problem , we first discuss the realizations of @xmath19 group in a hilbert space @xmath20 of functions on @xmath14 .",
    "our basic requirement is that the physical states as well as local observables ( like current densities ) are periodic in the angle variable @xmath21 with the period @xmath22 .",
    "now , the most general action of @xmath23 in @xmath20 is of the following form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the factor @xmath26 appears because the covering group of @xmath27 is the additive group of real numbers .",
    "taking into account we see that the above mentioned projective structure of @xmath20 is preserved with the period @xmath22 if for each @xmath28 @xmath29 for all @xmath21 and @xmath30 . to fulfill the condition the vectors from @xmath20 must be quasi periodic i.e. for each @xmath31 @xmath32 for a fixed @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 is rational , then @xmath35 is periodic .",
    "because the @xmath23 invariant measure on @xmath20 is ( up to a real multiplier @xmath36 ) the usual lebesgue measure @xmath37 , therefore the scalar product can be written as .",
    "it is easy to see that this product reduces to for a subspace determined by the condition with a fixed @xmath34 . ]",
    "@xmath38    notice that the transformation preserves the quasi periodicity condition .",
    "hereafter we will denote the hilbert space of the square integrable quasi periodic functions satisfying the quasi periodicity condition and with the scalar product by @xmath39 .",
    "we now return to the realization of @xmath17 . from the stone theorem we know that @xmath40 is generated by a self - adjoint operator @xmath41 via the exponential map @xmath42 taking into account of and we find that @xmath43 eqs . , and taken together yield @xmath44 .",
    "thus @xmath45 and consequently @xmath41 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "the domain of @xmath41 contains absolutely continuous functions @xmath35 from @xmath39 such that @xmath46 too .",
    "this can be verified also by means of the standard theory of self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators of von neumann and krein @xcite .",
    "indeed , the solutions of the equations @xmath47 i.e. @xmath48 are ( up to normalization ) @xmath49 of course @xmath50 do not belong to @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , the deficiency index of @xmath41 is ( 0,0 ) i.e. @xmath41 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "the next important question is related to the spectrum of @xmath41 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath51 has the solutions of the form @xmath52 because @xmath53 they satisfy the quasi periodicity condition and consequently @xmath54+l\\equiv \\epsilon+l,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is integer and @xmath56 .",
    "the symbol @xmath57 $ ] designates the biggest integer in @xmath58 . notice that for @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we remark that the transformation @xmath61 maps unitarily @xmath39 into @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ; here @xmath64 is the heaviside step function .",
    "notice that for @xmath65 these spaces are orthogonal in the sense of the scalar product @xmath66 .",
    "finally , consider the unitary phase operator @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 it is evident that @xmath67 preserves the quasi periodicity condition and consequently acts unitarily in @xmath39 .",
    "we can interpret @xmath67 as a `` position '' operator on the circle .",
    "using and we get @xmath69 so @xmath67 and @xmath70 are the ladder operators . furthermore , we can represent @xmath67 as @xmath71 , where the self - adjoint angle operator @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73\\right)f\\left(\\varphi\\right)\\ ] ] to preserve the quasi periodicity condition . because @xmath72 is bounded therefore its domain is the whole space @xmath39 .",
    "as was discussed in the previous section , to preserve periodicity of the circle @xmath14 under rotations on the level of the hilbert space representation , it is necessary to deal with the space of quasi periodic functions .",
    "for this reason a sensible discussion of the operator @xmath75 as a self - adjoint operator with @xmath17 invariant domain must be given in the context of the space @xmath39 .",
    "notice , that the action of @xmath75 does not violate the quasi periodicity condition and consequently leaves invariant the domain @xmath39 . taking into account the form of the scalar product and quasi periodicity condition we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath77 i.e. it is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to verify that the deficiency spaces for @xmath78 in @xmath39 are zero dimensional so the corresponding deficiency index is ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the domain of @xmath79 contains functions such that @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath81 consequently , the spectrum of @xmath79 in @xmath39 is of the form ( see eq . and ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 designates the set of integers .",
    "the common eigenvectors of @xmath41 and @xmath79 ( see eq . ) can be rewritten in the more convenient form with respect to @xmath79 , namely @xmath84 it should be noted that for @xmath59 we have @xmath85 , however in general @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "we finally recall that in the @xmath87 dimensional case the corresponding rotation group @xmath88 is not infinitely many connected as it takes place in the @xmath17 case as well as the first fundamental group for @xmath89 , @xmath87 , is trivial contrary to the @xmath90 case .",
    "this is the reason of the qualitative distinctions between free quantum mechanics on @xmath91 and @xmath89 , @xmath87 .",
    "now we are in a position to find all self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian which acts in the tensor product @xmath92 with a fixed @xmath33 . in view of our observations from sections [ iii ] and [ iv ]",
    ", @xmath39 is the direct sum of the one dimensional eigenspaces @xmath93 of @xmath41 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath16 acts in the direct sum of the tensor products @xmath94 , i.e. in @xmath95 using , , and we find that the hamiltonian takes the following form in a subspace @xmath94 : @xmath96 our purpose now is to determine the possible deficiency spaces of @xmath97 in the space @xmath98 with the scalar product @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath101 is symmetric for @xmath102 such that @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( here prime designates differentiation with respect to @xmath105 ) also belong to @xmath98 and satisfy the boundary condition @xmath106 .",
    "the conjugate operator @xmath107 has also the form however its domain is in general larger than @xmath101 . in order to find the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath16 we apply the von neumann - krein method .",
    "we seek the solutions of the eigenvalue equations @xmath108 where @xmath109 is introduced to keep the dimension of the right hand side of ; however as shown in the next section , it has a definite physical meaning . from and",
    "it follows that    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the modified bessel functions and macdonald functions , respectively .",
    "now , from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the regions @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( see appendix ) we deduce that are elements of @xmath98 only for @xmath115 .",
    "therefore @xmath116 and @xmath33 or @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus for @xmath119 and for @xmath117 and @xmath120 the deficiency indices are ( 0,0 ) so @xmath101 is in these cases essentially self - adjoint . on the other hand , @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    "are only symmetric because has for such @xmath123 the solutions @xmath124 respectively from @xmath98 .",
    "now , because we are looking for the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath16 we must solve the equation @xmath125    expanding @xmath126 with respect to @xmath127 given by , using and the above results we find that +    we have one solution for ( @xmath128 ) and one for ( @xmath129 ) @xmath130 +    we have two solutions for ( + ) and two for ( @xmath129 )    @xmath131    therefore , in the case of @xmath120 the deficiency index of @xmath16 is ( 1,1 ) and for @xmath132 it is ( 2,2 ) .",
    "thus , applying the von neumann - krein theory we arrive in the former case at the one parameter family of extensions and in the latter case the four parameter family .",
    "we remark that the parameters labelling the family of self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian are usually related to the properties of a barrier .",
    "an excellent example is a particle in a box @xcite .",
    "the authors do not know such relationship in the discussed highly nontrivial case of the pointed plane .",
    "we now discuss the case with @xmath120 ( see ) .",
    "according to the von neumann - krein theory the domain of @xmath16 contains in this case the vectors of the form    @xmath133    where @xmath134 , @xmath135 is an arbitrary complex number and @xmath136 fix the domain .",
    "of course @xmath137 in this case . in particular , @xmath138 .      the case of @xmath118 ( see ) is more complicated than the case with @xmath120 discussed above . applying the von neumann - krein theory",
    "we find that the domain of @xmath16 contains the vectors of the form @xmath139,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 , @xmath141 i.e. @xmath142 , @xmath143 is arbitrary complex two dimensional row vector , @xmath126 are given by and @xmath144 is a fixed unitary @xmath145 matrix defining this self - adjoint extension .",
    "therefore , demanding the rotational invariance of the domain of @xmath16 i.e. preservation of the form of the second term in the eq .",
    ", applying @xmath40 ( see and ) to both sides of the eq . and",
    "absorbing irrelevant phases in the row @xmath143 we find that the matrix @xmath144 must be diagonal .",
    "thus it turns out that the rotational invariance reduces the family of extensions to the two parameter one .",
    "more precisely , we can write in the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 are constants parametrizing the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath16 .",
    "as is well known and easy to show , the spectrum of @xmath16 contains continuous non negative part from 0 to infinity and possible bound states corresponding to negative energies .",
    "we now concentrate on the negative energy case . since the hamiltonian commute with @xmath40 it can be diagonalized in the negative part of its spectrum together with @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , the eigenstates of @xmath16 have determined value of @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalue equation for the radial part of the eigenvector of @xmath16 can be written as @xmath149 the general solution to is expressed ( up to normalization ) by the macdonald functions    @xmath150    where @xmath151 because @xmath152 only when this condition is valid . in",
    "the following we consider the cases @xmath120 and @xmath153 separately .",
    "we first study the case of @xmath120 ( so @xmath116 ) .",
    "since the corresponding solutions @xmath154 of belong to domain of @xmath16 therefore it is of the form , that is    @xmath155    the probability density @xmath156 with respect to the measure @xmath157 ( not @xmath12 ) , where @xmath158 is given by eq . and @xmath159 .",
    "notice that @xmath160 approaches zero when @xmath105 tends to zero . ]    therefore @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "if we apply the last condition satisfied by @xmath164 by taking the derivative of both sides of with respect to @xmath105 and make use of some elementary properties of the macdonald functions ( see appendix ) we get @xmath165 @xmath166    energy of the bound state .",
    "we point out that we have one - to - one correspondence between @xmath167 and the energy @xmath168 of the bound state .",
    "therefore @xmath169 can be treated as the extension parameter instead of @xmath167 . ]    in view of it is clear that the parameter @xmath170 fixes the energy scale .",
    "moreover , for a fixed self - adjoint extension given by the concrete @xmath167 we have only one bound state .",
    "notice that for @xmath171 we have singularity in the formula and i.e. there is no finite energy bound state for @xmath171 .",
    "we now investigate the case with @xmath118 . in this case @xmath148",
    "takes the values 0 or -1 .",

    "in this section we analyze the role of the time reversal symmetry .",
    "more precisely , we show that such symmetry which is most natural for the discussed case of a free dynamies considerably reduce the family of possible realizations of quantum mechanics on @xmath7 .    the operator of time inversion must be antiunitary to preserve the canonical structure of quantum mechanics . in our case its action on the wave functions @xmath183 is given by the following formula @xcite : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a fixed phase i.e. @xmath186 .",
    "the _ sine qua non _ condition to discuss the role of @xmath187 is its existence in the hilbert space under consideration that is in @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath187 symmetry is required , the domain of @xmath16 should be invariant under the action of @xmath187 .",
    "it is obvious that in order to define @xmath187 in the above product space it is enough to define it in the spaces @xmath189 and @xmath190 separately . in @xmath189",
    "the action is well defined because it does not affect the asymptotic behavior of vectors in the spatial infinity ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in @xmath190 the situation is different . applying @xmath187 to the defining relation for the quasi periodic functions we get @xmath191 following from the antiunitarity of @xmath187 .",
    "consequently , the conditions and are compatible only for @xmath120 or @xmath192 i.e. for periodic and antiperiodic functions with the period @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the time inversion operation can be defined only for these two cases i.e. in the spaces @xmath193 or @xmath194 now , let us analyze the invariance of the domain of the hamiltonian @xmath16 in these two cases .",
    "+     + by applying @xmath187 to both sides of , using @xmath195 , absorbing a phase in @xmath196 and taking into account that the complex conjugation does not change the boundary conditions for @xmath197 , we again obtain for @xmath198 the same relation .",
    "thus the domain of @xmath16 is in this case @xmath187-invariant .",
    "+     + by applying @xmath187 to both sides of we find that @xmath199 satisfy the same form of if @xmath200 i.e. we arrive at the following family of extensions : @xmath201 where we have used the explicit form of the function @xmath202 ( see appendix ) , @xmath203 satisfies as before the standard boundary conditions in @xmath204 , i.e. @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 are arbitrary complex numbers and @xmath136 .",
    "thus analogously as for @xmath192 we also obtain in the case of @xmath120 the one - parameter family of extensions .",
    "we now discuss the bound states .",
    "as mentioned above , in the case with @xmath120 the time reversal symmetry does not imply any additional condition .",
    "therefore , in this case our earlier observations concerning bound states hold true . on the other hand , in the case",
    "@xmath192 the additional condition @xmath208 reduces possible spectrum of negative energy states .",
    "namely , we have in this case doubly degenerate energy level : @xmath209\\ ] ]    energy of the bound state .",
    "it should be noted that we have analogous situation as in fig.[wyke0 ] referring to the energy of the bound state . ]    corresponding to the eigenfunctions @xmath210    the probability density @xmath211 ( with respect to the measure @xmath157 ) , where @xmath212 is given by .",
    "the behavior of @xmath213 at the origin is similar to @xmath160 presented in fig.[wykk0 ] . ]",
    "if @xmath167 does not belong to the interval @xmath214 $ ] then @xmath16 does not have negative energies in its spectrum .    finally , it should be noted that the form of the @xmath17 transformations is reduced by @xmath187-symmetry to @xmath215 i.e. we have @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , the momentum operator @xmath216 has the spectrum @xmath217 , where @xmath218 for @xmath120 and @xmath219 , where @xmath218 , for @xmath192 .    finally , we comment on some statements of the paper @xcite .",
    "first of all , the analysis of the two dimensional quantum mechanics by authors of @xcite is related to the pointed plane @xmath7 rather than to the plane @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , by using the polar coordinates they extract the origin from the coordinate frame and effectively work with the pointed plane @xmath7 which has completely different topology .",
    "furthermore , in our opinion the formation of the bound states is , as was shown above , a consequence of the change of the topology of the configuration space and it is not the result of the attractive centrifugal force .",
    "in fact , let us look at the radial hamiltonian @xmath101 .",
    "after unitary transformation @xmath220 mapping @xmath221 into @xmath222 the eigenvalue equation takes the form @xmath223    in the case of the bound state discussed in @xcite we have @xmath120 and @xmath116 ( i.e s - wave ) and the centrifugal potential is indeed attractive .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath224 and @xmath116 ( or @xmath225 and @xmath117 ) this effective potential is evidently repulsive or vanish in the @xmath187-symmetric case with @xmath192 , nevertheless the bound states can exists also in these cases as is evident from our discussion in section [ vi ] .",
    "moreover , in these cases the angular momentum does not vanish ( it equals @xmath226 for @xmath116 or @xmath227 for @xmath117 , respectively )",
    ".    we remark that an advantage of the method of the self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators applied in this work in comparison with the approach based on the formal dirac distribution potential ( fermi pseudopotential ) @xcite is that we can more naturally interprete the extension parameters as related to the boundary conditions specifying what happens in the extracted point . on the other hand",
    ", we would like to stress once more that the theory of self - adjoint extensions applied herein is the most adequate tool for the study of such subtle problems as quantum mechanics on a pointed plane .",
    "the general solution to the equation @xcite @xmath228 can be written in the form          * @xmath231 + for @xmath232 we have @xmath233 @xmath234 for @xmath235 the asymptotic formulas can be written as @xmath236 @xmath237 * @xmath238 + for @xmath239 we have @xmath240 + for @xmath235 the asymptotic relations can be written in the form @xmath241 + @xmath242"
