    "einstein s discovery that a body s rest energy @xmath2 is related to its inertial mass @xmath1 by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the speed of light , is arguably among the most famous in physics .",
    "while most treatments of relativistic mechanics deal with particles , einstein is clear in his original paper that eq .",
    "( [ e = mc2 ] ) is meant to be applied to any body , and speculates that the formula can be tested by searching for mass changes in materials with variable internal energy content such as radium salts.@xcite as a consequence , for a system with internal dynamics , one should expect that the internal motions would affect the center of mass motion through its effect on the system s inertial mass .",
    "a container of gas at room temperature has a larger mass than the same gas at a lower temperature since the warmer gas has greater internal energy from the increased average kinetic energy of the gas molecules .",
    "yet , one does not find much discussion in textbooks of how eq .",
    "( [ e = mc2 ] ) might modify the dynamics of a system as compared to a particle .",
    "presumably this is because the effects are tiny in most practical situations and the energy is a constant of motion .    when one attempts to raise similar questions in the quantum realm , an interesting problem arises . in the usual time - dependent schrdinger wave equation for the wave function @xmath5 of a free particle ,",
    "@xmath6 the particle s mass @xmath1 is a parameter .",
    "if one considers the system to be an atom , then the center of mass motion of the atom would be described by eq .",
    "( [ s eqn ] ) , but now what should we use for the mass ? if we take einstein seriously , then the mass should include the internal energy of the atom , but a quantum atom might not have a definite energy if it is in a superposition of internal energy states .",
    "if the universe obeyed galilean relativity , then bargmann s theorem forbids a quantum system from existing in a superposition of mass states,@xcite which would be inconsistent with einstein .",
    "of course , as einstein showed , our universe does not obey galilean relativity , but obeys special relativity ( if we exclude gravity as we do here ) . even in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "features of the non - galilean nature of the universe remain and void bargmann s argument.@xcite yet , there still remains the problem of how to describe quantum mechanically the motion of the center of mass of a system in a superposition of internal energy states .",
    "recently , several authors have developed a natural approach for incorporating the internal dynamics of a system into the dynamics of the system s center of mass by essentially making the mass of the system a dynamical variable .",
    "they have shown that in the quantum realm , this idea leads to special and general relativistic entanglement between a system s internal and external dynamics , producing a loss of coherence in quantum twin paradox interference experiments @xcite and universal decoherence from gravitational time dilation .",
    "@xcite ( however , see ref .   for a criticism of the latter effect . ) the general principle at work is that a quantum system with internal dynamics ( a `` quantum clock '' ) can be produced in a superposition of states that experience different proper times , leading to novel interference effects .    in this paper",
    ", we will examine this work with a simple derivation of the hamiltonian motivated by einstein s mass - energy relation eq .",
    "( [ e = mc2 ] ) which incorporates the internal and center of mass motions of the systems . a more formal derivation using lagrangian mechanics",
    "is relegated to the appendix .",
    "we then apply hamilton s equations to the new hamiltonian and show that they lead to physically intuitive results .",
    "we next extend the formalism to the quantum realm where we apply it to a 2-level atom trapped in an infinite potential well .",
    "this simple system illustrates the consequences of the relativistic entanglement of internal and center of mass dynamics .",
    "in this section , we provide a simple derivation of the formalism developed in refs .   for a small isolated system of interacting particles that are non - relativistic relative to their center of mass frame .",
    "in the appendix a more formal derivation is given of the system hamiltonian using lagrangian mechanics .",
    "we begin with the relativistic hamiltonian describing a free point particle of mass @xmath1 with momentum @xmath7:@xcite @xmath8 let us now replace the particle with a very small compact system such as an atom or molecule of mass @xmath9 .",
    "relative to the system s center of mass , the total momentum of the system vanishes , so the total energy of the system @xmath10 in this frame ( the rest energy ) is an invariant quantity : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the total 4-momentum of the system , and @xmath13 is the flat spacetime metric tensor .",
    "thus , the total energy relative to an arbitrary inertial frame can be written as @xmath14 where from now on we will write @xmath15 .",
    "we now make the _ ansatz _ that the total hamiltonian of the system can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) by making the replacement @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant , and @xmath18 is the system s hamiltonian relative to the center of mass frame , which , by definition , is written in terms of only the internal coordinates",
    ". then @xmath19 represents the non - dynamical part of the rest energy ( e.g. , the sum of the rest energies of the constituent particles ) . in order for the concept of center of mass to make sense here",
    ", we assume that there exists a frame in which all of the system particles are non - relativistic so that a center of mass frame can be defined.@xcite this requires that we assume @xmath20 for all subsequent calculations , and that we retain only first order terms in @xmath21 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the total hamiltonian of the freely propagating system becomes @xmath22 where @xmath7 is the total momentum , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the generalized coordinates and momenta relative to the center of mass .",
    "if the system is under the influence of an external potential @xmath25 , which is sufficiently uniform over the size of the system @xmath26 that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the position of the center of mass , then the hamiltonian of the system is to good approximation given by @xmath29 the first two terms on the right side of eq .",

    "the momentum equation for the @xmath32th component gives @xmath33 or @xmath34 which is the usual result from newton s 2nd law when an external force acts on the system .",
    "similarly , the equation for the system s center of mass velocity component @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the @xmath32th component of the system s center of mass position , is @xmath37 which gives for the expression for the center of mass velocity @xmath38 eq .",

    "( [ h ] ) leads to physically intuitive and reasonable results for classical systems .",
    "it also provides a more general underpinning for dynamical approaches of obtaining time dilation through the analysis of the physical mechanisms of clocks as done by jefimenko.@xcite let us now turn our attention to the dynamics of a quantum system governed by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will quantize the hamiltonian eq .  ( [ h ] ) .",
    "previous authors have obtained this hamiltonian and used it to examine the quantum interference of essentially freely propagating systems in gravitational fields . here",
    "we will show that similar quantum interference arises in the simplest bound system encountered by undergraduate students : a 2-level atom in a 1-dimensional infinite potential well .",
    "not only is this system simple , it also can be solved exactly . for novel behavior to be observed , the system will then be prepared in a superposition of both internal and center of mass states . using the density operator formalism to trace over the internal states , the center of mass position probability density",
    "is obtained , revealing a collapse and revival of the center of mass position interference due to the relativistic coupling .      in our analysis of the classical system , we assumed that one can find a frame in which the system is non - relativistic with a well - defined center of mass .",
    "we then placed essentially no restrictions on the motion of this center of mass . in this paper , we wish to investigate the quantum aspects of our problem without having to deal with the significant complications of particle creation , which requires a treatment using quantum field theory .",
    "therefore , we will now assume @xmath45 and include only the leading order special relativistic terms of our hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , which now becomes @xmath46 so far our treatment has been classical and three - dimensional . for the rest of this paper , we will focus our attention on 1-dimensional quantum mechanical systems , where we replace the center of mass canonical coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 with their corresponding quantum mechanical operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , while making similar substitutions with the internal coordinates .",
    "this leads to the quantum mechanical hamiltonian describing a small quantum system bound to a potential , @xmath51 to account for ground state energies , the constant @xmath17 is defined so that the energy of the internal system vanishes when it is in its ground state .",
    "we note in passing that all of these results could have been obtained by starting with the single particle hamiltonian @xmath52 and replacing the particle mass @xmath9 with the mass operator @xmath53 defined by @xcite @xmath54 and keeping only first order terms in @xmath55 .",
    "in essence , this takes einstein s famous formula eq .",
    "( [ e = mc2 ] ) seriously in the quantum realm where systems can be in superpositions of energy states , which also means they should be in superpositions of mass eigenstates .",
    "arguments have been made against mass superpositions,@xcite but they are based on galilean relativity rather than the non - relativistic limit of special relativity . finally , one can similarly deal with unstable quantum particles by replacing @xmath9 in eq .",

    ", one frequently considers problems where the non - relativistic center of mass and internal dynamics are known , and the remaining portions are small in comparison .",
