    "nanoscale light - matter interactions can be tailored using plasmonic approaches to have an impact on quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it has been conclusively demonstrated that propagating surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) can possess non - classical properties such as entanglement @xcite and squeezing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , inspite of the decoherence expected from losses and electron collisions , these properties are preserved during propagation and are manifested in the outcoupled photons @xcite .",

    "one important application where plasmonics can play a key role is in the development of room temperature single photon sources @xcite .",

    "deterministic out - coupling of single photons and tolerance to emitter positioning is another important factor affecting device performance @xcite .    at low temperatures",
    "when the linewidth of the emitter is narrow , resonant routes using microcavities can provide the purcell enhancement .",
    "the broadband nature of many quantum emitters such as nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond make them unsuitable for conventional resonant cavity based approaches @xcite .",
    "the high index of diamond also leads to total internal reflection of photons and a poor collection efficiency ( 4 % ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the use of nanoplasmonic structures capable of a broadband purcell effect is necessary for efficient extraction of single photons @xcite .",
    "plasmonic metamaterials which engineer the spontaneous emission can also be used to enhance the absorption spectrum of the isolated emitter @xcite . however , a significant limitation of any plasmonic approach is the presence of loss and non - radiative quenching @xcite . especially near the plasmon resonance , only a modest increase in quantum efficiency and collection efficiency is possible @xcite .",
    "the key is to move away from resonant approaches and focus on low mode volume plasmons .",
    "we emphasize that for applications requiring indistinguishable photons , photonic crystal and narrowband cavity approaches are ideally suited whereas plasmonic / metamaterial approaches have an advantage for broadband applications .    in this paper",
    ", we show that tailored plasmonic metamaterials support collective modes which can efficiently channel single photons from an isolated quantum emitter to highly directional beams and simultaneously provide a broadband purcell effect .",
    "our design for the single photon source , compatible with emitters such as nv centers in diamond , takes into account all non - idealities in the structure arising from the finite patterning scale , absorption and dispersion .",

    "the half angle of the plasmonic resonance cone is given by @xcite @xmath8 furthermore , for all the waves in the medium with wavevectors along the asymptotes of the hyperbola , the poynting vectors point in the same direction .",
    "since there are infinitely many waves ( in the emt limit ) with wavevectors along the asymptotes of the hyperbola , a spatial crowding of poynting vectors is expected in preferred directions ( fig.[resonanceconesfigure](b ) ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in anisotropic plasmas @xcite and emulated in microwave metamaterial circuits @xcite .",
    "here , we consider the plasmonic equivalent of resonance cone behavior at optical frequencies .",

    "low mode volume confinement of the emitter and the ability to function away from plasmonic resonances holds the key to efficient outcoupling of light . the proposed structure will lead to a platform for understanding propagation of non - classical light in plasmonic metamaterials and can be integrated with other plasmonic structures for future nanoscale quantum information applications .",
