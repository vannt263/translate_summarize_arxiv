    "in contrast , a small current applied perpendicular to the layers leads to linear voltage dependence ( within the regime of detectable resistivity ) , with nonlinear behavior at higher currents .",

    "we have observed that both charge and spin stripe orders are significantly enhanced by the field .",
    "the correlation lengths for the vortex - induced stripe orders@xcite are significantly larger than the typical vortex core size , so that the induced stripe order must coexist with superconducting screening currents .    can we find a way to make sense of the different behaviors in @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the regime where one indicates superconducting order and the other does not ?",
    "one way to possibly understand these differences is in terms of anisotropic vortex pinning . in measuring @xmath125",
    ", the response necessarily indicates that vortices are pinned .",
    "this pinning may be aided by the stripes present in the system . in the ltlo or ltt lattice structures ,",
    "stripes are pinned in orthogonal directions from one layer to the next . for a current flowing parallel to the layers with applied field",
    "@xmath3 , the transverse lorentz force in the plane would push pancake vortices in half of the layers in the modulation direction of the induced stripe order . given that the vortices appear to induce stripe order",
    ", the lorentz force may serve to pin each vortex core within the halo of induced spin order . because vortices between layers are ( attractively ) coupled electromagnetically,@xcite pinning in one layer will aid pinning in adjacent layers , even in those layers where the lorentz force acts along the stripe .",
    "in contrast , for a current perpendicular to the layers , there is no lorentz force on the pancake vortices , thus allowing them freedom to fluctuate parallel to the stripes , resulting in a lower threshold for detectable resistivity .",
    "another possibility to consider is whether there might be an intimate connection between the superconductivity and stripe order .",
    "a state with apparent superconducting order parallel to the planes but finite resistivity between the planes was previously observed in lbco @xmath6.@xcite there it occurs in zero field and onsets together with spin stripe order .",
    "frustration of the interlayer josephson coupling is evident from the extreme anisotropy of the resistivity and diamagnetism.@xcite for the present case , @xmath0 , the interlayer josephson coupling is finite in zero field , but the coupling is reduced by the field .",
    "dissipation appears while the josephson coupling is still finite .",
    "a large magnitude of @xmath4 in strong @xmath3 occurs for a range of temperatures where @xmath5 remains very small , suggesting a frustration of josephson coherence .",
    "we have also observed that @xmath3 enhances spin and charge stripe order .",
    "thus , there are significant qualitatively similarities between the phases of superconductivity with uniaxial resistivity in the @xmath0 and 0.125 samples .",
    "of course , there are also some quantitative differences . even in the state of uniaxial resistivity ,",
    "the in - plane superconductivity appears much more robust to @xmath3 in the @xmath0 sample than for @xmath6 .",
    "the pair - density - wave ( pdw ) superconducting state has been proposed@xcite to explain the frustrated josephson coupling in cuprates with strong stripe order.@xcite in the pdw state , the pair wave function is intertwined with the spin and charge stripe order such that the spin order and pair wave function minimize their overlap .",
    "while there has not been definitive evidence for the pdw state , there have been recent observations of time - reversal - symmetry breaking associated with the onset of the charge stripe order,@xcite which provide possible connections . in any case , one expects this state to be sensitive to disorder and perturbations , and the more rapid suppression of the superconducting signatures in @xmath3 in lbco @xmath6 is qualitatively consistent with expectations .",
    "the coexistence of uniform superconducting order with the pdw is expected to eliminate the sensitivity to disorder,@xcite and this might help to explain the more robust field dependence of the in - plane superconductivity in lbco @xmath0 . of course , the presence of uniform superconducting order should also provide a channel for interlayer josephson coupling , which is certainly a significant factor for the @xmath0 sample . nevertheless , even if the pdw state is relevant , we are not aware of any theory that could explain a superconducting state with field - induced uniaxial resistivity",
