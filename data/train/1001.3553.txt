    "wide band gap nitride semiconductors are now widely used for light emission in the blue and ultraviolet range.@xcite thanks to large band offsets , gan / aln heterostructures are also promising candidates for fast telecommunication devices based on intersubband transitions@xcite or for high - temperature single photon emitters.@xcite one of the specifics of nitride heterostructures is the existence of large internal electric fields due to spontaneous polarization and strains ( piezoelectricity).@xcite these built - in fields might transfer charges in the devices , leading for example to the formation of two dimensional ( 2d ) electron gases at the interfaces between gan and ( ga)aln layers.@xcite they might also separate the electrons from the holes in gan quantum wells and stranski - krastanov ( sk ) quantum dots , thereby reducing the band gap and oscillator strength ( quantum confined stark effect).@xcite it is therefore essential to understand and tailor the electric field in nitride heterostructures to suit a particular application .",

    "the validity of this assumption will be discussed in the next paragraphs .",

    "the gray dots are the al atoms in the aln barriers . ]    the tight - binding band gap energy @xmath173 of empty 4 nm thick gan qds is plotted as a function of the electric field @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ figeg ] .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 are reported between parenthesis .",
    "the excitonic correction is not included in this calculation and should further decrease the optical band gap by at most @xmath174 mev .",
    "the band gap energy is strongly red - shifted ( below the bulk value ) by the electric field ( stark effect ) .",
    "it depends almost linearly on @xmath107 and spans around 1 ev in the investigated range of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the ground - state electron and hole wave functions of a particular qd ( @xmath90 nm ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figwfn ] .",
    "as expected , the electron is confined at the upper interface , while the hole is confined at the lower interface of the qd .",
    "the electron and hole are , interestingly , both localized around the axis of the nanowire , where the strains are maximum , hence the piezoelectric field slightly larger than at the surface .",
    "this helps preventing one of the carriers from being trapped by the charged lateral surface states.@xcite        finally , we compare our theoretical predictions with the experimental results of ref . .",
    "in this work , the room - temperature luminescence of 1 to 4 nm thick gan qds embedded in 30 nm diameter nanowires showed clear evidence of the quantum confined stark effect .",
    "we have therefore computed the electronic structure of a 1 nm thick qd ( @xmath175 nm , @xmath176 nm ) , of a 2.5 nm thick qd ( @xmath177 nm , @xmath178 nm ) and of a 4 nm thick qd ( @xmath179 nm , @xmath180 nm ) . the geometry and thickness of the barriers were chosen after a detailed analysis of the experimental tem images.@xcite the calculated and experimental band gap energies are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figexp ] .",
    "all the dots are empty , which is consistent with the observation of the biexciton in the 1 nm thick qds.@xcite the electric field ranges from @xmath181 mv / cm for @xmath89 nm to @xmath182 mv / cm for @xmath163 nm .",
    "it is , as expected , much smaller than in gan / aln quantum wells@xcite ( qws ) and stranski - krastanov@xcite dots ( sks ) with similar sizes due to to strain relaxation and screening by the electron gas and surface charges ( see the comparison between qws , sks and qds in fig . [ figexp ] ) .",
    "the calculation reproduces the luminescence energies of the 1 and 2.5 nm thick qds within the error bars , and the downward trend of the electric field with increasing qd size evidenced in the experiment .",
    "still , the calculation underestimates the luminescence energy of the 4 nm thick qds , where the stark effect is the largest , by about @xmath183 ev .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ figeg ] , this suggests that the electric field in this qd is overestimated by @xmath184 % .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unclear at present . increasing the density of surface states to pin the fermi level in the bandgap of aln increases the electric field and ultimately charges the dots .",
    "the experimental data have , moreover , been collected at low enough excitation power to prevent screening by photogenerated multiple electron - hole pairs.@xcite the calculated electric field might be affected by the electromechanical coupling@xcite ( influence of the electric field on strains ) , by the uncertainties in the pyro- and piezoelectric constants of gan and especially aln , and by their dependence on strains ( non - linear piezoelectricity).@xcite a simple 1d model however shows that the electromechanical coupling should reduce the electric field by at most @xmath185 ( see appendix [ appendix ] ) .",
    "although the nanowires of ref .",
    "are likely metal - polar , their polarity has not actually been assessed experimentally.@xcite interestingly , we would like to point out that a n - face polarity would give a slightly better agreement between theory and experiment . in that case , the pyro- and piezo - electric field are reversed , so that a hole gas forms at the interface between the gan pillar and heterostructure and electrons accumulate at the top aln surface .",
    "the difference of potential across the heterostructure [ eq .",
    "( [ eqdv ] ) ] then becomes @xmath186 ev , which is slightly higher in magnitude than for the metal - face polarity [ @xmath187 ev ] . as a consequence , the pyro- and piezoelectric field in the qd",
    "are better screened , so that the luminescence in the 4 nm thick qds is raised by @xmath188 mev .",
    "further experiments ( for different barrier and qd thicknesses ) , as well as detailed polarity measurements might therefore be needed to get a complete picture .",
    "we have modeled the quantum confined stark effect in @xmath0$]-oriented aln / gan / aln nanowire heterostructures using a tight - binding approach .",
    "we have taken strain relaxation and band bending into account in the calculation of the pyro- and piezoelectric field .",
    "we have shown that strain relaxation reduces the piezoelectric polarization , and that the electric field pulls out electrons from the occupied states of the top surface .",
    "these electrons accumulate in the gan pillar below the heterostructure , thereby screening the pyro- and piezoelectric field .",
    "we suggest that the electric field is likely strong enough to pin the fermi level in or close to the valence band edge of aln at the top surface . as a consequence , the electric field",
    "is significantly reduced with respect to gan / aln quantum wells or stranski - krastanov quantum dots .",
    "this is in agreement with recent experimental data on gan / aln nanowire heterostructures.@xcite the calculation however overestimates the electric field in thick quantum dots , which calls for further experiments with different geometries and detailed polarity measurements .",
    "we have , for this purpose , provided a simple 1d model for the electric field to help the design of such heterostructures .",
    "we thank b. daudin , b. gayral , j. renard and c. bougerol for fruitful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we give an estimate of the electromechanical coupling and of its effect on the optical band gap of the nanowire heterostructures .",
    "we assume that the heterostructures are biaxially strained onto gan . according to fig .",
    "[ fige]b , this should provide an upper bound to the electric field , hence to the electromechanical coupling .",
    "the in - plane strains @xmath189 in the gan qd and aln barrier are then :      following ref .",
    ", the vertical strain @xmath191 reads in each material : @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are the macroscopic elastic constants.@xcite the first term is the `` uncoupled '' elastic strain while the second one describes the feedback of the electric field @xmath195 on the structure ( electromechanical coupling ) . solving eq .",
    "( [ emc ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ eqeqd])([eqeinfsup ] ) for the electric field yields :      in a 4 nm thick qd with @xmath179 nm and @xmath180 nm ( experimental geometry ) .",
    "the electromechanical coupling can therefore reduce the electric field by at most 5.75% . according to fig .",
    "[ figeg ] , a @xmath197 mv / cm decrease of the electric field would account for a @xmath198 mev increase of the bang gap .",
    "additionally , the strains in the gan layer are :      using the interband deformation potential @xmath200 ev in gan,@xcite the strains in the coupled system would further increase the band gap by @xmath201 mev . as a whole ,",
    "the electromechanical coupling can not , therefore , be expected to increase the band gap by more than @xmath202 mev .",
    "the same order of magnitude is obtained assuming the heterostructure is biaxially strained onto aln .",
