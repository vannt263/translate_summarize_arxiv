    "<S> we propose a microscopic description of heavy fermions in upt@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the assumption that two of the three 5@xmath1 electrons of the u ions are localized . </S>",
    "<S> band - structure calculations based on this supposition reproduce the observed de haas - van alphen frequencies very well . the observed enhancement of the quasiparticle mass as compared with the lda band mass results from the local coulomb interaction of the delocalized @xmath1 electrons with the localized ones . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalization of the coulomb interaction matrix yields the level scheme of the localized @xmath2 states . assuming a splitting of the ground - state doublet by the crystal field of similar size as in upd@xmath3al@xmath0 results in a mass enhancement factor of order 10 in agreement with experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> psfig.sty    pacs .     </S>",
    "<S> 71.10.-w , 71.10.ay , 71.18.+y , 71.27.+a    2    the intermetallic compound upt@xmath0 is a well known heavy fermion system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sommerfeld @xmath4 coefficient of the linear low - temperature specific heat is strongly enhanced , i.e. , @xmath4 = 420 mj/(mole  u @xmath5k@xmath6 ) and so is the pauli - like spin susceptibility @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> both findings can be explained by attaching a large effective mass m@xmath8 to the quasiparticles , i.e. , one which is by a factor of order 20 bigger than the band mass m@xmath9 obtained from local density approximation ( lda ) calculations for the electronic structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , heavy quasiparticles have been observed in de haas - van alphen ( dh - va ) experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments unambiguously confirm that upt@xmath0 has to be regarded as a strongly correlated fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> although a complete picture of the low temperature phase of upt@xmath0 has emerged , a comprehensive theoretical picture of the heavy quasiparticles is still missing . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally accepted that the latter are derived from the u 5f states . </S>",
    "<S> the number of itinerant u 5f electrons as well as the microscopic mechanism yielding the high effective masses are still controversial . </S>",
    "<S> it has been considered a success of the lda that the dh - va frequencies could be related to extremal orbits on the fermi surface obtained by band - structure calculation which treats the u 5f states as itinerant . from these findings , however , one should not conclude that the u 5f states are ordinary band states which can be described by conventional electronic structure calculation . as pointed out above </S>",
    "<S> , the calculated energy bands are too broad for explaining the effective masses . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they are too small in order to fit the photoemission data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter shows a broad peak just below the fermi energy e@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite different from the data of heavy- fermion systems involving ce@xmath11 instead of u ions , such as cept@xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> a small kondo resonance is observed near e@xmath10 together with a broad 4@xmath1 peak approximately 2 ev below that energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we add that the photoemission data near e@xmath10 of upt@xmath0 resembles that of ube@xmath12 and upd@xmath3al@xmath0 , two other heavy - fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is also similar to that of upd@xmath0 , which has localized 5@xmath1 electrons except that in this case there is no @xmath1 weight left at e@xmath10 . from the above </S>",
    "<S> it follows that a more microscopic understanding of the heavy - quasiparticle excitations is highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> it seems clear that the kondo effect as well as more exotic versions of it @xcite can be excluded for upt@xmath0 , for various reasons .    </S>",
    "<S> there are indications that u ions may have two types of @xmath1 orbitals , i. e. , with localized and with delocalized electrons , depending on the degree of hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> for example , quantum chemical calculations for uranocene u(c@xmath13h@xmath13)@xmath3 have demonstrated this @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown that the system has low - lying excitations which are due to local rearrangements of the 5@xmath1 electrons . also neutron inelastic scattering experiments on upd@xmath3al@xmath0 point towards the existence of localized as well as delocalized 5@xmath1 electrons in that material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the susceptibilities of upt@xmath0 and upd@xmath3al@xmath0 look very much alike . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are the basis of our theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present letter is to suggest that in upt@xmath0 we deal with localized as well as delocalized 5@xmath1 electrons and that the coupling of the two subsystems results in heavy fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the mass enhancements of the quasiparticles are shown to follow from the local exchange interaction of the delocalized 5@xmath1 electrons with localized f@xmath6 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the situation resembles that in pr metal where a mass enhancement of the conduction electrons by a factor of 5 results from virtual crystal field ( cef ) excitations of localized 4@xmath2 electrons @xcite . as shown below </S>",
    "<S> , the theory suggested here allows for an explanation of the observed dh - va frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the attained accuracy is similar , if not better than that of previous lda band structure calculations , although the fermi surface shows distinct differences in the two cases .    in the following we consider two of the 5@xmath1 electrons as localized , in agreement with the absence of any kramers doublets in cases where </S>",
    "<S> a cef splitting of u states has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> we put the localized @xmath1 electrons into 5@xmath1 j=@xmath14 orbitals , with j@xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is also consistent with the observed ground state , e.g. , of upd@xmath3al@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 5@xmath1 j=@xmath14 , j@xmath17 states , on the other hand , are treated as itinerant band electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this yields the observed dh - va frequencies when subsequently a band structure calculation is done .    </S>",
    "<S> a plot of the calculated dh - va frequencies and of the observed ones is shown in figure [ fig : crosssections ] . </S>",
    "<S> we should like to emphasize that the theoretical data were obtained without any adjustments of the bands .        </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface from which the data are derived is displayed in figure [ fig : fermisurface ] . </S>",

    "<S> these features imply the existence of open orbits for magnetic fields pointing along the a - direction as suggested by magnetoresistance data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second band intersects the fermi surface several times giving rise to a @xmath19-centered hole ellipsoid which is enclosed by a large closed @xmath19-centered electron surface . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is strongly anisotropic in the basal plane . finally , there are closed ellipsoids centered at h. the assignment of the observed quantum oscillation frequencies to extremal orbits on this fermi surface is as follows : the thermodynamically most important orbit @xmath20 is assigned to the @xmath19-centered strongly anisotropic electron surface . the variation with magnetic field direction of the dh - va frequencies is quantitatively reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the spitting obtained in the a - c plane . </S>",
    "<S> this feature which is also found in lda calculations has been confirmed by recent experiments @xcite .    the observed effective masses and </S>",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the enhancement of the observed effective masses m@xmath8 over the ones calculated within the present theory m@xmath9 is of the order of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be quantitatively explained by the interaction of the itinerant 5@xmath1-states with the localized f@xmath6 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath23 is obtained in analogy to ref . </S>",

    "<S> the prefactor a is the 5@xmath1-weight per spin and u atom of the conduction electron states near e@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element m describes the transition between the ground - state singlet and the low - lying excited singlet state at energy @xmath25 of the localized @xmath2 subshell in the presence of a cef . with appropriate numbers put into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) we find @xmath26 10 .    in the following , we present the details of the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> band - structure calculations have been performed starting from the self - consistent lda potentials but excluding the u 5@xmath1   j=@xmath14 , j@xmath27=@xmath28 and j@xmath27=@xmath16 states from forming bands . </S>",
    "<S> the localized 5@xmath1 orbitals are accounted for in the self - consistent density and , concomitantly , in the potential seen by the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the 5@xmath1-bands are calculated by solving the dirac equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic bandwidth of the itinerant u 5@xmath1 j=@xmath14 , j@xmath27=@xmath29 is taken from the lda calculation while the position of the corresponding band - center c is chosen such that the density distribution of the conduction states as obtained within lda remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the @xmath1 band relative to the calculated pt d states is consistent with photoemission data . </S>",
    "<S> the band centers of the remaining u 5@xmath1 states are shifted to higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence the corresponding orbitals can not form bands in the energy range of interest . </S>",
    "<S> they affect the bands in the vicinity of the fermi level via the hybridization tails only . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the u 5@xmath1 bands with j@xmath30 hybridize strongly near the fermi level so that the @xmath1 occupancy per u atom for the delocalized 5@xmath1 electrons amounts to n@xmath31 = 0.65 indicating that we are dealing with a mixed valent situation .    </S>",
    "<S> we next turn to the discussion of the localized u 5@xmath1 states . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplet structure of the localized @xmath2 states is calculated by diagonalizing a 6 x 6 coulomb matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit splitting is rather large and therefore a jj - coupling scheme is used . </S>",
    "<S> this simplification gives six 2-particle states build from @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting eigenstates are generally no longer eigenstates of the total angular momentum j@xmath6 , but remain eigenstates of j@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb matrix elements are calculated following condon and shortley@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inputs are the slater - condon parameters f@xmath35 ( coulomb integrals ) and g@xmath36 ( exchange integrals ) which are evaluated with the radial function r@xmath37 for u which is determined from a self - consistent band structure potential . </S>",
    "<S> the radial function is calculated for an energy given by the center of gravity of the 5@xmath1 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the required integrations are done within the atomic sphere surrounding the u ion . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalization of the matrix yields a doubly degenerate ground state j@xmath38 which must be an eigenstate of j = 4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the pauli principle permits even values of j only , i.e. , j = 0 , 2 , 4 in our case . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath39 have an overlap of 0.865 with the hund s rule ground state @xmath40 derived from the ls - coupling scheme . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the choice of jj vs. ls coupling should only weakly affect the results obtained for the ground - state multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> the two - fold degeneracy of the ground - state is lifted by a cef yielding the two states    @xmath41    note that @xmath42 has been suggested as ground state of upd@xmath3al@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the splitting energy @xmath25 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is of order 20 mev as in upd@xmath3al@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next - higher eigenstates of the coulomb matrix is a doublet with j@xmath44 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy separating it from the ground state is rather large ( 0.4 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore neglect all higher levels . for the evaluation of the effective mass enhancement </S>",
    "<S> we need to determine the coupling between the localized and delocalized @xmath1 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is directly obtained from the expectation values of the coulomb interaction u@xmath45 in the 5@xmath46 states . for the latter we use </S>",
    "<S> the product states @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath48 amounts to -0.38 ev from which we deduce the transition matrix element    @xmath49    we may also rewrite m in form of an exchange coupling between the itinerant and localized @xmath1 states . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the land @xmath50 factor for the localized @xmath2 states must be determined . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that this @xmath50 factor is @xmath51 and that the exchange integral is @xmath52 , which is of the correct size for 5@xmath1 electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to the mass enhancement eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : effmass ] . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states n(0 ) corresponding to the fermi surface in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fermisurface ] equals @xmath53 15.5 states/ ( ev cell ) , the other parameters are @xmath54m@xmath55 = 0.036 ev@xmath6 , 4a@xmath6=0.13 and @xmath56 20 mev . when these parameters are put into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) a mass enhancement @xmath57 of approximately 8.3 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this is in excellent agreement with experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> the above scenario provides for a satisfactory explanation of the heavy quasiparticles observed in upt@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the different hybridization behavior of the various u 5f orbitals requires further investigations . in a separate study </S>",
    "<S> we shall investigate the effect of strong local electron correlations on the different lda hybridization matrix elements . in concluding we want to point out that the way of treating the @xmath1 electrons in upt@xmath0 may be also applicable to other uranium compounds . </S>"
