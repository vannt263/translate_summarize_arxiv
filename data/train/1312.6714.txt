    "consider the problem of approximating a function @xmath0 defined on a domain in @xmath1 by a sequence of numerical solutions @xmath2 .",
    "the target function @xmath0 may be an exact solution of a second or higher order partial or ordinary differential equation , and the sequence may be piecewise polynomials from a discontinuous galerkin method @xcite or reconstructed polynomials @xmath3 in an intermediate phase @xcite , and even post - processed finite element solutions to achieve superconvergence @xcite .",
    "although we had discontinuous galerkin numerical solutions in mind , the source of the problem is not important for our purpose here , as it only puts the degree of smoothness of @xmath0 in perspective .",
    "now suppose that @xmath0 is in @xmath4 ( standard notation for sobolev spaces here , supindex for the order of derivative and subindex for the @xmath5 based space ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that the approximation solutions should be as smooth ( in some sense ) in order to achieve optimal convergence rate .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give clear and rigorous results on this simple minded principle .",
    "sun @xcite showed in one dimension if the mesh is uniform and the function @xmath0 has @xmath6 weak derivatives in @xmath7 , then a necessary condition can be formulated . in particular in the @xmath8 case",
    ", the jumps of the @xmath9 derivatives , ( across a mesh point ) of the approximation piecewise polynomial of degree @xmath10 must be less than or equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this one dimensional result is perhaps not surprising , once one realizes the interpolation error behaves in a similar way : taking a derivative , one loses a power of @xmath12 , assuming @xmath13 . in the appendix of this paper ,",
    "the assertion is actually proved by comparing the derivatives of @xmath0 , its continuous piecewise lagrange interpolant @xmath14 , and @xmath3 at a mesh point .",
    "this short proof can even be carried over to higher dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , it can not be extended to higher dimensions when @xmath15 due to the restriction on continuity imposed by the sobolev imbedding theorem ( see remark [ a.1 ] in the appendix for other reasons ) . since now",
    "one starts with a function @xmath16 , there are always some @xmath17 and up for which the @xmath17th derivative of @xmath0 at a point of interest is not well defined . on the other hand , in hindsight an idea ( lemma [ crucial ] below ) in the much lengthier and originally unfavored proof in @xcite for one dimension can be distilled and generalized to prove the two and three dimensional versions of the same principle .    while sun_etal .",
    "_ @xcite have successfully applied it to the analysis of numerical methods for one dimensional nonlinear conservation laws , it is quite clear that this principle has a very broad scope of applications such as safeguarding divergence or negating optimal order convergence in designing new methods , let alone in creating smoothness indicators @xcite in an adaptive algorithm , and so on .",
    "being motivated by its application potential in higher dimensions , in this paper we generalize the concept of numerical smoothness of a piecewise polynomial in @xcite to higher dimensions and show that in order for the convergence of @xmath18 to @xmath0 to have optimal order @xmath10 in @xmath19 , @xmath18 must have @xmath20 numerical smoothness , provided that the domain can be meshed by quasi - uniform subdivisions into triangles or quadrilaterals in 2-d and tetrahedrons or hexahedrons ( cubes ) in 3-d .",
    "we accounted for both interior and across interface numerical smoothness . in @xmath21 3 , we formerly define the across - interface numerical smoothness in definition [ smooth_def ] , which is well motivated by the theorems in @xmath21 2 and also define interior numerical smoothness in definition [ smooth_def1 ] . the main result that states optimal order convergence implies numerical smoothness",
    "is proved in theorems [ smoothness ] and [ smoothness1 ] .",
    "this section is written in such a way that the reader can go read it directly after the introduction section .",
    "the organization of rest of this paper is as follows . in @xmath21 2 , we first derive basic error estimates without imposing conditions on meshes other than the shape regularity .",
    "the main theorem is theorem [ main2 ] , now under the quasi - uniform condition on the mesh .",
    "finally , in @xmath21 4 we give a short proof of the one dimensional version of theorem [ smoothness ] and explain why it can not be extended to higher dimensions .",

    "next we move to the 2-d case . for a given @xmath97 , we will use a dual mesh @xmath98 consisting of covolumes as in chou and vassilevski @xcite .",
