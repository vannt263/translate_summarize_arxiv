    "the ionization degree @xmath3 (= @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the electron and h@xmath7 number density , respectively ) in dense molecular clouds plays a key role in determining the initial conditions which precede the collapse to form a star ( e.g. shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field threading the dense gas is sufficiently large to prevent immediate collapse , ambipolar diffusion of neutrals across field lines can lead to a situation where a dense core of gas is gravitationally unstable .",
    "the time scale for such ambipolar diffusion is proportional to the ionization degree and it therefore becomes of interest to develop methods of estimating the ionization degree based upon the abundances of various species which trace the ionization in the dense gas .    in an earlier article ( @xcite , hereafter cwt98 ) , we studied the possibility of using the [ ] / [ ] abundance ratio as a tracer of the ionization degree in dense molecular gas , following previous work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the time ",
    "dependent models of  @xcite to study the expected behavior of a variety of species thought to be relevant in this context and compared with the abundances measured by  @xcite .",
    "an analogous study carried out by  @xcite reached very similar results .",
    "we confirmed earlier work ( @xcite ) which showed that a critical parameter in addition to the ionization degree which determines the fractionation of deuterated species ( and hence abundance ratios such as [ ] / [ ] ) is the degree of depletion of carbon and oxygen bearing species onto the surfaces of interstellar dust grains .",
    "measuring the ionization degree in reliable fashion therefore requires the use of observations to solve for both @xmath3 and depletion .",
    "one possible approach to this problem discussed by cwt98 was to use the cyanoacetylene ( ) abundance as a `` depletion indicator '' ( see also  @xcite ) . a more detailed analysis on the possibility to use  to estimate the degree of depletion in a dense core is currently under way ( comito et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .    the cwt98 and  @xcite studies used data with angular resolution of the order of an arc minute and did not search for spatial variations in the ionization degree and hence in the [ ] / [ ] ratio",
    ". studies of variations in the deuterium fractionation and in the degree of ionization across cores have been previously done in active star forming regions such as the r coronae australis molecular cloud ( @xcite ) , and in massive cores located in regions that are currently forming stellar clusters ( @xcite ) . in the former case , the electron fraction was found to decrease near the cluster of newly born stars , whereas in the latter no differences in the ionization fraction were detected between cores with and without associated stars .",
    "no changes in the ionization fraction was found either between the edge and the center of the mapped regions .",
    "however , no similar studies have been performed so far in the direction of pre  star  forming cores in relatively quiescent zones of our galaxy , which give the opportunity to investigate the initial conditions in the star formation process presumably not triggered by external agents .    in any model of a pre ",
    "protostellar cores , one expects to observe a concentration of material around the region of highest density .",
    "as the density becomes higher , one expects the degree of ionization to decrease , the degree of depletion onto dust grain surfaces to increase , and , consequently , the fractionation of deuterated species to be enhanced ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , one might naively expect that deuterated species correlated with high depletion might trace the phase prior to the formation of a protostar . with this in mind",
    ", we undertook observations using the iram 30-m telescope of a variety of species towards the dense core l1544 in the taurus molecular cloud which is thought ( e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ) to be in a phase shortly prior to that at which collapse occurs .",
    "the data and a kinematical study of this region are presented in caselli et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter paper i ) . here",
    "we present our determination of the electron fraction across l1544 and show that @xmath3 at the center of the core  where the h@xmath7 number density is @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10  is about 2@xmath1110@xmath12 , about five times smaller than expected if the electron fraction is due to cosmic  ray ionization alone and the cosmic  ray ionization rate @xmath13 has its `` standard '' value ( @xmath3 = 1.3@xmath14 ; cf .",

    "the determination of electron fraction is presented in section 3 . finally in section 4",
    ", we discuss the consequences of our measurements for the understanding of high density cores like l1544 .",
    "an accurate estimate of electron fraction implies measurements of ( i ) the column density of the observed molecular ions , ( ii ) the temperature as well as ( iii ) the density structure of the core , and ( iv ) the amount of co depletion . in the following sections we will describe the above points separately .",
    "because of its low dipole moment , co is likely thermalized at the typical core densities and it can be used to measure kinetic temperatures .",
    "@xcite used the j = 1@xmath150 transition of ,  and  to determine the excitation temperature of the co emitting gas across l1544 and found @xmath16 @xmath8 12 k , in good agreement with previous kinetic temperature estimates based on co and  observations ( @xmath8 10 k ; @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we repeated a similar analysis using ( 10 ) and ( 10 ) data and found an average value of @xmath16 = 10.10.1 k .",

    "we assume on this basis a constant temperature of 10 k in the rest of our analysis . however",
    ", model calculations of the dust temperature in pre  stellar cores (  @xcite ,  @xcite ) predict a fall off in dust temperature from @xmath8 14 k at the edge to @xmath8 7 k at the center .",
    "this is likely to be reflected also in the behaviour of the gas temperature at least for densities above 10@xmath18 @xmath10 .",
    "although for our purposes we can neglect such findings ( our simple chemical model presented in sect .  [ smodel ] is not significantly affected by a change in temperature from 10 to 7 k ) , the predicted temperature gradient affects our estimates of the volume density from , as discussed below .      from our molecular line data",
    "we can deduce good number density estimates only at the l1544 `` molecular peak '' and in a few adjacent positions ( see sect .  [ sdcod ] , [ sn2dpd ] ) .",
    "therefore , for our electron fraction estimates across l1544 ( sect .",
    "[ smodel ] ) we used the density profiles obtained from 1.3 mm continuum observations ( @xcite , hereafter wma ) and isocam absorption in the mid  infrared ( @xcite , hereafter bap ) .",
    "these density profiles are described in section  [ sdescription ] .",
    "a number of line intensity ratios measured by us are sensitive to density .",
    "since the line ratios depend on collisional rates , one in principle derives n ( ) independently of assumptions about abundance .",
    "however , in a situation where the density varies rapidly along the line of sight ( as suggested by the dust emission and absorption ) , the density which one derives will be a weighted mean . in the following ,",
    "we describe some estimates we have made using different tracers .",
    "our observations of ( 32 ) and ( 21 ) allow estimates to be made of the hydrogen number density in the regions responsible for the emission of these lines as well as estimates of the  column density .",
    "we have done this using an lvg statistical equilibrium code similar to that described e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "the approach is essentially identical to that discussed by  @xcite .",
    "the collisional rates were taken from those calculated for collisions of para - h@xmath7 with  by  @xcite assuming a temperature of 10 k. at this temperature , the rates are essentially identical to the more recent rates of  @xcite .",
    "we assumed a dipole moment of 3.9 debye following  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fnh2 ] , we show the results obtained in this manner superimposed upon the half  maximum contours of the ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) maps ( see paper i for details on these data ) and the 1.3 mm continuum map of wma .",
    "we see a definite tendency for the highest densities derived from  to be close to the dust emission maximum .",
    "we see also that the values found for n ( ) towards the dust peak are close to those derived by wma from their observations ( @xmath8 10@xmath21 @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , there are a number of _ caveats _ of which one should be aware .    one of these is that the ( 2 - 1 ) line is almost certainly optically thick towards the core of l1544 .",
    "this is suggested by both our lvg results themselves and the comparison at offset ( 20,-20 ) with   ( see paper i ) which suggests an optical depth of order 4 .",
    "our density estimates are thus sensitive to the geometry and velocity gradients within l1544 .",
    "we note additionally that our ( 3 - 2 ) map can not be convolved to the 21 resolution ( 1.5 times worse ) because it is undersampled ( grid of 1.7 times hpbw ) .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that we are sampling in  the high density inner core of l1544 .",
    "our  and  observations allow an independent estimate of the density .",
    "this is of special interest because , as we have seen in paper i , the  and , in particular , the  integrated intensity maps appear to trace best the dust emission ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another characteristic of these species is that , due to the hyperfine splitting , we can determine directly the optical depth in several transitions utilising the relative intensities of the hyperfine satellites .",
    "this reduces considerably the errors in our determinations of level column densities for , say ,  , as compared to .",
    "finally , it is of some importance that we have detected ( 3 - 2 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) .",
    "this is because we expect such transitions to be essentially collision dominated in the sense that the integrated line intensity has , for a given temperature , a one  to  one correspondence with the integral of the product of the density and the  density along the line of sight .",
    "we call this integral @xmath22 the  collision measure @xmath23 in the following .",
    "essentially , the ( 3 - 2 ) line intensities are proportional to @xmath23 in the limit where collisional deexcitation is negligible with respect to radiative transitions which for ( 3 - 2 ) at 10  k for example implies n ( ) less than @xmath24 .    we have developed an lvg code for ( ) analogous to that for .",
    "we use the collisional rates of green(1975 ) for collisions of  with he and multiply them by 1.4 to take account of the differing mass of .",
    "we also have adjusted the escape probability to account for hyperfine splitting in the 1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , and 3 - 2 transitions of .",
    "we first use our determination of the optical depth in the ( 1 - 0 ) line at offset ( 20 , -20 ) to obtain an estimate of the  column density and find @xmath25 = @xmath26  at offset ( 20 , -20 ) .",
    "then , we determine @xmath27 from ( 32 ) data , which have been averaged in a 3@xmath113 grid of positions spaced by 10  and centered at ( 20 , -20 ) ( see tab .  3 of paper i , second row ) in order to simulate a 20  beam , similar to the 10 observations . from the @xmath28 ratio we find a mean density of 1.3@xmath1110@xmath18 , smaller than the value derived above from our  measurements and also smaller than the central densities suggested by the results of wma and of bap .",
    "these discrepancies may be partly due to the assumption of a constant temperature of 10 k , in particular in the dense highly co  depleted nucleus of l1544 , best traced by n  bearing molecules , where @xcite derive @xmath29 @xmath8 7 k.    we can in analogous fashion use our  observations to obtain a density estimate . at the center of l1544",
    "assuming a temperature of 10  k , we find a mean density @xmath30 = @xmath31 = @xmath32 .",
    "this is a factor of 2 higher than the  estimate above which might perhaps reflect the fact that the  emission is more compact than that of . however , it is still a factor of 3 smaller than the density deduced from dust continuum and  observations , again suggesting a possible temperature fall off in the core center .",
    "the depletion factor @xmath33 is defined by the ratio between the `` canonical '' fractional abundance of co ( 9.5@xmath1110@xmath34 , @xcite ) and the observed @xmath35(co ) = @xmath36 . to determine @xmath33 at the dust peak position , cwt99 compared the  integrated intensity with the 1.3 mm continuum dust emission flux density from wma .",
    "they found that @xmath33 @xmath8 10 at the dust peak , and that observations are consistent with a model where co is condensed out onto dust grains at densities @xmath8 10@xmath18 @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding radius of the region where co is severely depleted is @xmath8 6500 au and the depletion causes 2.3  of gas to be lost to view in molecular line emission .",
    "here we extend this analysis to all the other positions where  has been observed . to do this",
    "we divided the 1.3 mm map by the ( 10 ) map .",
    "this division implies three steps : ( i ) convolve the 1.3 mm map with a 22beam ( the hpbw of the  observations ) and reproject it to have the same coordinates as the  map ; ( ii ) make a regularly sampled  map ; ( iii ) divide one map by the other .",
    "the result of this operation can be translated into a depletion factor map .",
    "we somewhat arbitrarily assume `` normalcy '' to be given by [ ] /[h@xmath7 ] = 4.8@xmath1110@xmath38 ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming an excitation temperature for  of 10 k and a 1.3 mm dust grain opacity @xmath39 = 0.005 @xmath40 g@xmath41 ( wma ) , we find that the depletion factor @xmath33 can be expressed as : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the integrated intensity ( over all hyperfine components ) of ( 1 - 0 ) and @xmath44 is the flux density at 1.3 mm in a 22  beam . in those positions where only  was observed , we used @xmath33 = 0.085 @xmath45 .    in fig .",
    "[ fdep ] the depletion factor map is shown together with the 1.3 mm continuum map from wma .",
    "there is a fairly good correspondence between the @xmath33 and 1.3 mm contours as one might expect given the `` flat '' nature of the  and  maps .",
    "we note however that the peaks are not coincident and there is a projected distance between the @xmath33 and the dust peaks is 13  ( about half a beam ) .",
    "this appears significant but one must remember that the and  maps are probably dominated by emission from gas of density a few times @xmath46  to the foreground or background of the dust emission core . thus structures unrelated to the pre ",
    "protostellar core may influence our maps .",
    "the methods used to estimate column densities of the observed species , which give same results within a factor of 2 , are reported in appendix  [ acolumn ] . here",
    "we show the results .",
    "the statistical equilibrium calculations used to estimate the  density ( see sect .",
    "[ sdensity ] ) can also be applied to a determination of the column densities of  and . as in the case of density determination",
    ", our errors grow rapidly if the observed lines are optically thick . towards the peak of l1544",
    ", we have used the optically thin species  and   to determine  and  column densities and  to determine the co column density .",
    "we have considerable confidence that in these three cases , the observed lines are in fact optically thin ( see discussion in sect .  [ adcop ] ) . for , we can check ( see e.g. cwt99 ) optical depth using the relative intensities of the hyperfine satellites .",
    "we nevertheless for most of the following discussion use and  column densities derived from transitions which are optically thick towards the dust emission peak and in the immediate vicinity .",
    "the reason for this is the greater extent of our maps in these lines .",
    "the justification is that our checks with the optically thin variants yield results which are consistent with those presented here .",
    "thus we have checked our  column densities using  where available and our  column density using the  measurement at ( 20,-20 ) .",
    "we conclude that our column density estimates are accurate to within a factor of 2 also when the optical depth is high ( see appendix  [ adcop ] for details ) .",
    "bearing this in mind , we present in fig .",
    "[ dco - hco ] our  and  column density maps .",
    "one sees in the first place that these differ considerably from the integrated intensity maps . while for the reasons discussed above , the column density maps ( or ratio maps ) should be treated with caution , we consider them a better estimate than simply scaling the integrated intensity maps .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ dco - hco ] the inferred ratio of column densities @xmath47 .",
    "is clearly more concentrated towards the structure seen in dust emission by wma than is .",
    "considering the column density ratio map , we see that [ ] / [ ] appears to vary by almost an order of magnitude between the centre and the edge of the map ( roughly an arc minute or 0.04 parsec ) .",
    "away from the peak , the inferred @xmath47 ratios are considerably lower than found in the survey of  @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because we expect to be observing higher density gas on average with greater degrees of depletion than in the arc minute resolution @xcite survey .",
    "the  @xcite estimates for @xmath47 vary between 0.02 and 0.07 whereas our results for l1544 vary from 0.04 near the dust peak to values a factor of 10 lower at the edge of our map .      the  and column density maps , together with @xmath48()/@xmath48 ( ) ,",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "[ dco - hco ] .",
    "our  observations as noted previously ( see also paper i ) show that  _ traces the dust peak emission better than any other species_. it also turns out that the values we infer for @xmath0 are much higher than for @xmath1 . at offset ( 20,-20 ) , we infer @xmath0= 0.24@xmath49 .",
    "this is a factor of 4 higher than our maximum value for @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude from this that the degree of deuterium enhancement increases towards the dust emission peak of l1544 .",
    "cwt98 used a simple chemical model to find analytic expressions which allow one to directly estimate @xmath3 ( and the cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath13 ) once @xmath1 , @xmath33 , and @xmath50 are known from observations ( see their eqns .  3 and 4 )",
    "however , these expressions furnish upper limits of @xmath3 and @xmath13 ( see section [ sul ] ) . in fact",
    ", in the simple chemical scheme used to derive cwt98 analytic expressions , dissociative recombination of molecular ions onto negatively charged dust grains and gaseous reactions involving atomic deuterium ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are not taken into account .",
    "moreover , this chemical model is only valid for homogeneous clouds , whereas l1544 clearly has a density structure and a varying amount of depletion and molecular abundances along the line of sight ( see sect .  [ sder ] ) .",
    "in fact , cwt98 eqns.(3 ) and ( 4 ) have been applied to data with a significantly lower ( factor of @xmath8 6 ) spatial resolution compared to the present observations , so that any gradient was smoothed out in the beam and resultant @xmath1 , @xmath33 , and @xmath50 should be considered as `` average '' quantities for the cores .",
    "the same problem is met if `` pseudo  time dependent '' chemical codes are used .",
    "the density structure as well as differential depletion of molecular species has to be taken into account to reach a satisfactory agreement with observations ( see also @xcite ) .    in this section",
    ", we discuss what one can say about the ionization fraction in l1544 .",
    "one may obtain a lower limit to the ionization fraction @xmath3 summing the abundances of observed molecular ions in l1544 .",
    "this limit may be close to the real ionization fraction , if refractory metals of low ionization potential such as mg and fe are significantly depleted ( see e.g. fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we first briefly discuss the limits one can place on ionization degree based upon the observed molecular ion column densities .",
    "lower limits of the electron fraction across l1544 can be obtained by simply summing up column densities of the observed molecular ions : @xmath51 @xmath52 has been obtained for each observed position toward l1544 based upon the column density determinations from sect .",
    "[ sder ] and the column densities of wma .",
    "we find in this way a lower limit at essentially all positions where  was observed of : @xmath53 @xmath8 1@xmath1110@xmath12 with little variation .",
    "these estimates do not however really sample the high density nucleus of l1544 and in order to do that , we use the model discussed in the following section .      deriving the behavior of the electron fraction as a function of radius",
    "is complicated however by the strong abundance gradients due to depletion .",
    "these cause observed quantities such as e.g. the  column density to be strongly influenced by background and foreground emission in the observed lines .",
    "this is the main rationale for the simple model introduced below .",
    "the results of wma and bap show rather clearly that the l1544 `` core '' itself contains a high density `` core '' where the density reaches values as large as @xmath54  over a volume of radius several thousand au .",
    "we have shown previously ( cwt99 ) that co is depleted by at least an order of magnitude in the central high density peak . in this section , we consider the behavior of the ions and of the electron density in the depleted region .",
    "we have done this with an extension of the model briefly described by cwt99 and used to fit the co depletion .",
    "we assume for this purpose a spherically symmetric density distribution with a constant molecular hydrogen density of ( i ) @xmath55  out to a radius @xmath56 = 2900 au followed by a @xmath57 fall off out to a cut  off radius of 10000 au , which simulates the results of bap based on the extinction measured with isocam against the emission of small particles at a wavelength of 7 @xmath58 m ; ( ii ) 1.3@xmath1110@xmath21 out to a radius @xmath56 = 2500 au followed by a @xmath57 fall off out to a cut  off radius of 13000 au , as found by wma on the basis of 1.3 mm observations of dust emission .",
    "the h@xmath7 column and volume density inside @xmath59 determined by bap are a factor of 3.8 and 2.4 , respectively , lower than those found by wma ( see however the comments in table 2 of bap ) .",
    "it is clear that this approximation is somewhat crude and indeed that the distribution departs considerably from spherical symmetry .",
    "moreover , the recent study of @xcite has shown that the temperature drop in the l1544 core nucleus to about 7 k ( in agreement with @xcite ) implies a steeper density profile than in the isothermal case of wma and bap .",
    "however , we believe that our simple model suffices to explain many of the observations .    as in cwt99 , we have followed the time  dependent depletion of co neglecting dynamic effects .",
    "that is to say , we assume the depletion time  scale to be more rapid than dynamical time  scales and assume initially a `` canonical '' co abundance of @xmath60 relative to .",
    "however , we also consider in this study the recycling of co back into the gas  phase using the cosmic ray desorption rate proposed by  @xcite and a co adsorption energy @xmath61(co ) to the grain surface of 1210 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is for a surface of sio@xmath62 while for binding with a co mantle , sandford and allamandola ( 1990 ) find @xmath61(co ) to be 960 k. this is critical for the model because we have , following  @xcite , assumed a time ",

    "rough estimates suggest that `` chemical '' desorption due to molecular hydrogen formation ( @xcite ) appears to be less effective .",
    "indeed , a recent theoretical work by  @xcite has shown that the chemical desorption of co can occur on small grains with size less than 20 @xmath69 , but it is negligible on larger grains .",
    "a crucial point in our discussion moreover is that we also consider the analogous depletion of molecular nitrogen assuming an initial  fraction of 7.5@xmath1110@xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is a maximal value in that it is based on nitrogen depletion measurements in diffuse clouds .",
    "critical for our model is also that we adopt a adsorption energy of @xmath70 787 k (= 0.65@xmath71(co ) ; @xcite based upon calculations of  @xcite ) considerably lower than that for co. the exponential dependence of the cosmic ray desorption rate above causes more effective depletion of co and gives rise to a layer where  is the most abundant gas phase species containing heavy elements and where  is an abundant ion .    in a model of this type",
    ", one can write for the abundance @xmath72 of species @xmath64 ( where @xmath64 can be co or ) relative to   that : @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is the total abundance of @xmath64 in both gas and solid phase , @xmath75 is the steady state gas phase abundance given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the depletion time scale @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 is the sticking coefficient , @xmath80 is the grain number density , @xmath81 is the thermal velocity of @xmath64 , and @xmath82 is the grain cross section ) . the time ",
    "scale @xmath83 is simply @xmath84 .",
    "we are assuming here that one can neglect destruction of @xmath64 due to either gas or solid  phase reactions .",
    "this rather crude model of depletion has the advantage that it can be rapidly computed as a function of density and time .",
    "for the present purpose , we ( as in cwt99 ) continue the calculation until such time as we reach a central co column density compatible with the observed  column density toward the central dust peak in l1544 . at this point , as discussed by cwt99 , the main contributions to the observed co column come from lower density foreground and background material while co in the central high density peak is depleted to very low abundances .",
    "the present calculations confirm this .",
    "even though cosmic ray desorption is included , the central co abundance is still depleted by a factor of 10@xmath85 ( @xmath8 30 ) , if the wma ( bap ) density structure is used .",
    "this also depends sensitively on @xmath86 and indeed our results suggest that @xmath86 must be larger than @xmath8 900 k in order to have depletion in the central region as observed ( for the standard values of @xmath13 and @xmath79 , see tab .  [ tbfit ] ) .",
    "a similar result has also been found by  @xcite , who can not reproduce the observed `` hole structure '' in the co column density if the grain surface is covered by non ",
    "polar ice ( i.e. @xmath86 = 960 k ) .",
    "although the gas phase chemistry in general has long time scales , the ion chemistry is relatively rapid and thus one can expect in reasonable approximation that the abundances of ionic species such as ,  etc . are given by the steady state chemical equations using the instantaneous abundances of the neutral species which are important heavy element repositories .",
    "the time scale for the `` ion chemistry '' is expected to be determined by recombination to species such as  with a rate of @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the dissociative recombination rate and @xmath5 the electron density . for `` canonical estimates '' @xmath89  and @xmath90 @xmath91 s@xmath41",
    ", we find a time scale of 30 years for the ion chemistry which is much less than depletion time scales .",
    "thus one can compute  in terms of the instantaneous co abundance and  in terms of the instantaneous  abundance .",
    "analogously , the electron fraction @xmath3 can be computed in terms of global estimates for the molecular and metallic ions and using the same instantaneous abundances for co ,  etc . in the gas phase .",
    "the approach we have adopted is a simplified version of the reaction scheme of  @xcite .",
    "thus , we compute a generic abundance of molecular ions `` mh@xmath92 '' assuming formation due to proton transfer with  and destruction by dissociative recombination with electrons and recombination on grain surfaces ( using rates from  @xcite ) . the abundance of is calculated considering formation as a consequence of cosmic ray ionization of molecular hydrogen and destruction by proton transfer with heavy molecules ( essentially co and here ) as well as due to the processes mentioned above for molecular ions .",

    "we stress that this is _ not _ our `` best fit '' model ( see sect .",
    "[ sbestfit ] ) but it illustrates several features of our results .",
    "we note first the rapid increase of the co depletion factor with decreasing radius , i.e. the gaseous co abundance is reduced to a value of order 10@xmath105 ( 0.03 ) of the `` canonical value '' of @xmath106 relative to  in the constant density central region , using wma ( bap ) density values .",
    "this contrasts with n@xmath7 which ( although itself depleted ) becomes the most abundant heavy molecule in the center .",
    "it is the rapid variation of these quantities as a function of density which renders necessary a consideration of abundance variations along the line of sight and hence radially .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fstandard ] are the variations of the and  abundances .",
    "their ratio ( @xmath107 ) increases by roughly an order of magnitude from 0.04 ( 0.04 ) to 0.7 ( 0.35 ) , using wma ( bap ) parameters , between the edge and center of our model .",
    "the variation in ion densities shown in the bottom panel of fig .  [ fstandard ] reflects the behavior of the depleted species in the two standard models .",
    "thus , in a wma core ,  abundance is strongly reduced in the center because of co depletion , whereas  shows a rather flat dependence due to the increase of the deuterium fractionation with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "a similar behaviour is present for the  and  abundances , with the consequence that @xmath108 and [ ] / [ ] become greater than 1 in the innermost parts of the core . in a bap core",
    ", the lower density causes less efficient co and n@xmath7 depletion , and much shallower profiles for   and  fractional abundances .",
    "the ions plotted in the figure are `` major ions '' at all radii ( except that  becomes abundant in the central region under some circumstances ) suggesting that for depleted high density cores , the sum of the observed molecular ion abundances may give a good estimate of the electron abundance .",
    "this is a great simplification relative to `` normal cores '' where `` metal ions '' have comparatively high abundances .",
    "our calculations suggest that in high density depleted cores , the depletion of `` metals '' ( assumed here to behave like co ) is likely to be so large that this complication becomes negligible .",
    "we have used an initial metal abundance about one order of magnitude lower than that measured in diffuse clouds , as is usual ( `` low metals '' ) in chemical models of dense clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most convincing aspect of our model is that it qualitatively explains the enhancement of in the center of l1544 , close to the depletion peak .",
    "thus it explains the higher degree of fractionation of deuterium in  as compared with .",
    "it also explains roughly the differing depletions observed for , co , and .",
    "in fact , as discussed in the next section , the qualitative features of the model are in excellent agreement with observation . the pattern that ions and deuterated species peak close to dust emission maxima appears to be a general feature ( @xcite ) of nearby cores and suggests that the model presented here has wider applications than to l1544 .",
    "several model calculations have been performed to find the `` best fit model '' , i.e. the model which best reproduces observed column densities at the peak of l1544 .",
    "we started with a `` standard '' cloud model , where @xmath13 = 1.3@xmath1110@xmath109 s@xmath41 , the co binding energy @xmath110(co ) = 1210 k ( @xcite ) , the n@xmath7 binding energy @xmath110(n@xmath7 ) = 787 k , the minimum radius of dust grains @xmath111 = 10@xmath112 cm , the sticking coefficient @xmath79 = 1.0 ( see table  [ tbfit ] ) .",
    "two density distributions ( from wma and bap ) were considered and the above parameters were varied until the quantity : @xmath113 ^ 2 \\label{echi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] was minimised . in eqn.([echi ] ) , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the observed and model calculated column density of , , , and at the l1544 `` molecular peak '' .",
    "@xmath116 is the uncertainty associated with @xmath117 , which has been assumed here to be a 30% error .",
    "thus we assume the errors in our column density determination to be dominated by systematic effects such as those caused by our summary treatment of the radiation transfer .    the column density dependence as a function of impact parameter @xmath118 predicted by the two `` best fit '' models ( for the two density distributions )",
    "can then be compared with those observed .",
    "we have made azimuthal averages of our observed column densities using averages within bins defined by @xmath119 arcsec , with @xmath120 = 0 , 20 , 40 , ...",

    "the parameters used in these models are reported in tab .",
    "[ tbfit ] together with the @xmath121squared estimates using equation ( [ echi ] ) . to understand our results ,",
    "it is useful to recall that we need to assume high degrees of co depletion in order to explain the co and column densities .",
    "a certain amount of nitrogen depletion is also needed to explain n ( ) . such low gas phase molecular abundances cause extremely high degrees of d fractionation however with the model expectation for e.g. [ ] / [ ] higher than unity in the dense depleted central regions .",

    "the range of parameters in tab .",
    "[ tbfit ] demonstrates that the peak column densities on their own only give partial constraints on the chemical models .",
    "[ fbfit ] however shows that the extent of the emission in the various ions is also an important constraint . in models 1 and 2 ( tab .",
    "[ tbfit ] ) for example , the model half  width for  is much too small . while this could be partially due to our azimuthal averaging ( see fig .  [ fmol_dist ] )",
    ", it is also the case that the cosmic ray ionization rate has been chosen to have values in models 1 and 2 more than an order of magnitude lower than in the standard model and the result is that n ( ) is much too small at large radii .",
    "a way of improving the agreement between observations and model predictions is to more efficiently deplete co outside the core center ( to increase the  column density at @xmath118 @xmath122 0 ) .",
    "this can be done by increasing the co binding energy and thus reducing the efficiency of cosmic ray induced desorption . however",
    ", this also causes an increase in deuterium fractionation which is not observed . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sdco ] , [ ] / [ ] is observed to have rather low values at high impact parameter .",
    "this suggests that reactions other than with co and  act to reduce the  abundance .",
    "we therefore postulate the existence of a volatile neutral species which will remain in the gas phase when co is depleted and which has a proton affinity permitting transfer of a proton from .",
    "this species needs to be abundant ( at least as abundant as co ) to effectively keep the deuterium fractionation low in those regions where co is significantly depleted .",
    "one possibility may be atomic oxygen , which is predicted to be quite abundant in dense clouds ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its binding energy onto a dust grain covered with water ice is thought to be a factor of about 1.5 smaller than that of co ( @xmath110(o ) @xmath8 800 k ; tielens & allamandola 1987 ) .",
    "we have therefore run several models which include atomic oxygen in the chemistry , with different values of @xmath110(o ) , and determine the @xmath123 and column density profiles in the same fashion as before .",

    "our results are compatible with electron fractions only a factor of order 3 higher than the lower limits based on the inferred  abundance in the nucleus of l1544 .",
    "such low electron fractions are linked to the depletion of metals which , being positively charged , directly affect the electron budget of cloud cores .",
    "we use an initial abundance of metals 10 times lower than in the standard relation quoted above and this causes the difference in the coefficient ( see sect .  [ sdescription ] ) .",
    "the difference in the exponent is to be attributed to the further metal depletion inside the core .",

    "gas and dust temperatures are probably coupled and hence there may be a gradient in the gas temperature too ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "this simulates the observed depletion and can reproduce the observed dependence of the column densities of species such as , , , and  as a function of offset .",
    "the main advantage of this is that it allows us in objective fashion to consider the relative contributions to observed column densities from the high density depleted nucleus and the lower density foregrond ( background ) gas .",
    "there are large uncertainties in both the input to the chemistry and the process of inferring radial dependences of molecular abundances from the observations .",
    "one interesting result is that we get the best fit to the observed deuterium fractionation in models in which atomic oxygen is allowed to remain with an abundance of order @xmath106 in the gas phase .",
    "there are some problems associated with this but one needs more detailed models of both the surface and gas phase chemistry to test this .",
    "it does have an observational consequence which is that  becomes a major ion towards the dust peak , in agreement with numerical chemical models of @xcite .    applying this model , we find that the ionization degree in l1544 is likely to be an order of magnitude smaller than estimated using `` canonical formulae '' existing in the literature , mainly because of the reduced metal abundances .",
    "the result is a tentative finding because we have difficulty in fitting the observed abundances as a function of offset in l1544 and in particular the observed degree of d fractionation .",
    "however , our estimates for ionization degree do not vary greatly when one compares the different models which give an adequate fit to the observed column density distributions .",
    "we conclude that in the case of l1544 , the ionization degree is lower and hence the ambipolar diffusion timescale is shorter .",
    "our estimated timescale is of the same order as the free - fall time consistent with the idea that the nucleus of the l1544 core is undergoing dynamical collapse .",
    "a final point to emphasize is that in models without atomic oxygen , or where o also experiences strong depletion , the main ion in the highly depleted region is , so that the mean mass of positive ions decreases from @xmath8 30 ( in the `` canonical '' undepleted case , where the representative ion is ) to @xmath8 3 .",

    "therefore it is important to have clear detections of the seven components before attempting an hfs fit .",
    "however , even in the presence of high sensitivity spectra one can encounter problems if the transition is very thick ( @xmath156 @xmath176 30 ) because the class fit procedure is limited to @xmath156 values smaller than 30 . in these cases , it is convenient to estimate the ( 10 ) optical depth from the thinnest component ( the lowest frequency @xmath221 = 1@xmath222 @xmath15 0@xmath223 line , see  @xcite ) assuming a certain value of @xmath16 ( e.g. the mean value , @xmath224 , which in l1544 is 5 k ) , and using eqn .",
