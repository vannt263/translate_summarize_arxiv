    "the origin of spiral structures in disk galaxies is one of the unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "the density wave model is a classical model for spiral arm formation @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the spiral arm is considered as a quasi - stationary density wave that rotates around the galactic center with a constant pattern speed .",
    "since the wave winds much more slowly than the material arm , the winding problem is avoidable .",
    "another picture is a dynamic material wave model . in a differentially rotating disk ,",
    "a leading density pattern rotates to a trailing one due to the shear . during the rotation , the leading mode",
    "is amplified into spiral arms due to the self - gravity if toomre s @xmath0 is @xmath2 .",
    "this mechanism is called swing amplification @xcite . in this model ,",
    "spiral arms are a superposition of many unstable waves .",
    "the spirals generated by the swing amplification are transient and recurrent , which are observed in @xmath1-body simulations of multi - arm spirals @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed the linear analysis of the collisionless boltzmann equation and found the swing amplification .",
    "if the spirals are generated by the swing amplification in @xmath1-body simulations , it is expected that the spirals correspond to the most amplified wave in the linear analysis .",
    "however , @xcite did not investigate the property of the most amplified wave in detail .",
    "@xcite investigated the azimuthal wave number of the most amplified wave by the liner analysis of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "however , his formula is only available for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the shear rate @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the galactocentric distance , @xmath7 is the circular frequency , @xmath8 is the oort constant , and @xmath9 is the epicycle frequency . using this formula , @xcite estimated the pitch angle of spiral arms for @xmath3 .",
    "observationally , it has been known that the pitch angle tends to decrease with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath1-body simulations and investigated the pitch angle of spiral arms and found that the galaxies with higher shear rates tend to have smaller pitch angles , which is consistent with the observations .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as paper i ) investigated the pitch angle by local @xmath1-body simulations and the linear analysis .",
    "we performed local @xmath1-body simulations with various @xmath4 and found that the pitch angle decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "we obtained the fitting formula of the pitch angle that is available for wider range than that in @xcite .",
    "based on the linear theory of the swing amplification by @xcite , we derived the pitch angle formula for large toomre s @xmath0 , which is almost the same as the fitting formula by @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "this formula also seems consistent with the grand - design spirals in barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the swing amplification can explain some aspects of basic physics of the spiral arm formation .    in this paper , we extend paper i to investigate the other quantities that characterize spiral arms and understand the swing amplification .",
    "one of the important quantities is the amplification factor , which means how the wave amplitude increases during the swing from leading to trailing .",
    "using the goldreich - lynden - bell model @xcite with the reduction factor @xcite investigated the dependence of the amplification factor on the azimuthal wavelength for @xmath10 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed the same analysis for general @xmath4 . however , in these works , the most amplified wave was not focused on . in paper",
    "i , we showed that the pitch angle of spiral arms in @xmath1-body simulations can be explained by the most amplified wave in the linear theory .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate the most amplified wave .",
    "the dependence of the wavelength and amplification factor of the most amplified wave on @xmath4 and @xmath0 has not been investigated by the linear theory in detail yet . moreover ,",
    "the property of the most amplified wave has not been confirmed by @xmath1-body simulations quantitatively .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend paper i to calculate the amplification factor and radial and azimuthal wavelengths of the most amplified wave , which enables us to understand the structures of spiral arms .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with the julian - toomre model and gives the wavelength of the most amplified wave and the amplification factor . in section 3 , we compare the results of the julian - toomre model with those by local @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a summary and discussions .",
    "first we briefly summarize the julian - toomre model @xcite .",
    "we consider local cartesian coordinates @xmath11 whose origin revolves around the galactic center with the circular frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath12- and @xmath13-axes are directed along the radial and rotational directions , respectively , and the @xmath14-axis is normal to the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane .",
    "we consider the plane wave with the radial wavelength @xmath15 and the azimuthal wavelength @xmath16 .",
    "because of the shear , the wave rotates from a leading wave to a trailing one .",
    "while @xmath15 changes with time @xmath17 , @xmath16 remains constant .",
    "we set @xmath18 when the radial wavenumber @xmath19 , that is , the pitch angle is @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the negative time @xmath21 corresponds to a leading wave , and the positive time corresponds to a trailing one .",
    "we use the non - dimensional parameter @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the unperturbed surface density , which is the same as @xmath25 in @xcite . during the rotation , the wave amplitude changes .",
    "@xcite derived the equation for the evolution of the density amplitude from the collisionless boltzmann equation in the corotating frame of the wave .",
    "the time evolution of the density @xmath26 with the imposed density perturbation @xmath27 is described by the integral equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the initial time and @xmath30 is the kernel function @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 is toomre s @xmath0 and @xmath35 is the radial velocity dispersion @xcite . as seen in equation ( 2 ) , @xmath26 is a function of two disk parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath0 , and two wave parameters @xmath29 and @xmath36 . assuming that the imposed density is described by the delta function @xmath37 and using the simpson s rule , we solve equation ( [ eq : int0 ] ) numerically .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : den_evo_jt ] shows the time evolution of @xmath26 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the variable @xmath42 is the normalized time @xmath43 .",
    "the density amplitude has a peak at the positive time , that is , the most amplified wave is trailing . the peak density @xmath44 depends on the initial time @xmath45 , but the time for @xmath44 barely depends on @xmath46 , which is @xmath47 .",
    "optimizing @xmath46 , we can calculate the maximum amplitude with fixed @xmath36 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : den_evo_jt ] shows the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath46 .",
    "the wave is most amplified with @xmath48 , where @xmath44 is @xmath49 .",
    "more generally , @xmath44 depends on @xmath46 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , by optimizing @xmath46 and @xmath36 we can calculate the most amplified wave for the disk model given by @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : t0xdep ] shows @xmath44 for various @xmath29 and @xmath36 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the peak density has the maximum value @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this most amplified wave is considered as the wave observed in @xmath1-body simulation .",
    "we investigate the pitch angle @xmath53 , the azimuthal wavelength @xmath54 , the radial wavelength @xmath55 , and the amplification factor @xmath50 of the most amplified wave , where @xmath56 is calculated by @xmath57 figure [ fig : pitchjt ] shows the dependence of these quantities on @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we obtain their fitting formulae as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath0 .",
    "we have already obtained the fitting formula of the pitch angle in paper i @xmath61 where we neglected the weak dependence on @xmath0 considering the @xmath1-body simulation results . in this paper , we derive a more general fitting formula based on the linear theory .    the most amplified wave has the maximum amplitude at time @xmath62 . the corresponding pitch angle @xmath53 of the most amplified wave is @xmath63 according to paper i , @xmath62 decreases with @xmath0 and approaches @xmath64 for large @xmath0 . considering these behaviors , we assume @xmath65 substituting equation ( [ eq : taumax ] ) into equation ( [ eq : pitch00 ] )",
    ", we obtain the pitch angle @xmath66 using the least square fit method , we obtain @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the relative error is less than 4.7 % for @xmath69 , while the maximum relative error is about 30 % for @xmath70 .    in practice , the range @xmath71 is important . for example , in paper i , regardless of the initial @xmath0 , @xmath0 quickly increases and becomes larger than about @xmath72 due to gravitational scattering by the spiral structure . in this range , @xmath73 increases with @xmath0 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , indicating that the dependence on @xmath0 is weak .",
    "thus , setting @xmath73 as the intermediate value @xmath76 , we obtain the almost same formula as equation ( [ eq : fit_pitch ] ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath54 for the efficient swing amplification is @xmath77 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : pitchjt ] , the amplification is significant for @xmath78 and decreases with @xmath79 .",
    "we find that the simple power law @xmath80 is appropriate for any @xmath0 and @xmath54 weakly depends on @xmath0 .",
    "while @xmath54 decreases with @xmath0 for @xmath81 , @xmath54 increases with @xmath0 for @xmath82 .",
    "assuming @xmath83 and using the least square fit method , we obtain the following formula @xmath84 the relative error of this formula is less than 20 % . for the range @xmath85 , we obtain the simpler formula @xmath86 where the relative error is less than 9 % .      substituting equations ( [ eq : fit_pitch2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fit_xf2 ] ) into equation ( [ eq : lambdafor ] )",
    ", we obtain the radial wavelength @xmath87 as already mentioned , for @xmath71 , we can approximate @xmath88 . in this case , using equation ( [ eq : fit_xf_simp ] ) , we obtain the simpler fitting formula @xmath89 this formula agrees well with the linear analysis . for example , @xmath55 is almost constant for @xmath90 and is about @xmath91 for @xmath92 , and for @xmath93 , @xmath94 increases and exceeds @xmath95 .",
    "the maximum amplification factor @xmath50 increases with decreasing @xmath0 . this is because small @xmath0 means that the self - gravity is strong relative to the stabilizing effects due to the rotation and the velocity dispersion .",
    "the dependence on @xmath58 is somewhat complicated .",
    "for @xmath96 , @xmath50 increases with @xmath58 from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath99 , @xmath50 is almost constant for @xmath100 and is about @xmath101 and decreases with @xmath58 for @xmath102 .",
    "similarly for @xmath92 , @xmath50 is almost constant for @xmath100 is about @xmath103 and decreases with @xmath58 for @xmath102 . for @xmath104",
    ", we find that the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath58 is roughly described by @xmath105 .",
    "considering various function forms , we find that the dependence on @xmath0 is approximated by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a constant .",
    "using the least square fit method , we obtain @xmath50 for @xmath108 as @xmath109 this fitting formula has relatively large error , but it roughly agrees with the linear analysis , which demonstrates the sensitive dependence on @xmath0 .",
