    "since the discovery of @xmath6 violation in 1964  @xcite , great effort has been placed in understanding the origin and mechanism of this asymmetry . in 1973 ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa proposed a model where @xmath6 violation is accommodated within the weak interaction as an irreducible complex phase in the quark mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "today we refer to this as the ckm matrix and with three known fermion families it can be written as    @xmath12    the unitary nature of the matrix implies there are six orthogonality conditions obtained by row - column multiplication with its inverse .",
    "one of these conditions which is relevant to @xmath7 decays is :    @xmath13    each orthogonality condition requires the sum of three complex numbers to be zero , and therefore can be represented geometrically in the complex plane as a triangle .",
    "these are known as ` unitary triangles ' , and for the condition expressed in equation  [ buni ] , we refer to the angles in the triangle as @xmath10 = @xmath14 , @xmath15 = @xmath16 and @xmath17 = @xmath14 .",
    "two @xmath7-factories have been built , babar at slac usa and belle at kek japan , with the aim of measuring @xmath6 violation in the @xmath7 system and to constrain further the ckm matrix using information from @xmath7 meson decays .",
    "we can write the time dependent amplitude of the @xmath18 state at @xmath19 = 0 decaying into a final state @xmath20 as    @xmath21,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 = @xmath23 is the amplitude of the @xmath18 decay to the final state @xmath20 , @xmath24 is the amplitude for @xmath25 and @xmath26 give the weak eigenstates @xmath27 in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath25 ) basis @xmath28 . the average between the h and l masses",
    "is @xmath29 and the difference is @xmath30 , whilst we make the approximation @xmath31 .",
    "when both @xmath18 and @xmath25 can decay to the same final state @xmath20 , @xmath6 violation can occur through the interference between mixing ( @xmath32 ) and the decay ( @xmath33 ) , even if @xmath6 is conserved in both @xmath34 .",
    "pairs of @xmath7 mesons are generated at the @xmath35 resonance where the two mesons oscillate coherently between the @xmath18 and @xmath25 until one decays .",
    "we consider the time interval @xmath36 between the decay of one @xmath7 flavor eigenstate ( or `` tag '' ) and the decay of the other @xmath7 to a @xmath6 eigenstate @xmath20 where the decay rate in terms of @xmath36 can be written as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and it is assumed @xmath39 and the @xmath40 sign represents the @xmath18(@xmath25 ) tag . in the @xmath35 center of mass frame the @xmath7 meson is nearly at rest , leading to a strong correlation between the reconstructed mass and the missing mass of the partner @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the typical choice for an independent pair of kinematic variables is    @xmath41    where the asterisk refers to the @xmath35 frame and the subscript @xmath7 denotes the reconstructed @xmath7 .",
    "true @xmath7 decays tend to be peak at @xmath42 = 0 and @xmath43 = @xmath44 .",
    "the tagged @xmath7 does not need to be fully reconstructed as the important information required is simply the decay vertex and whether it s a @xmath18 or @xmath25 .",
    "the flavor of the tagged @xmath7 is determined by the sign of the charge in the ( @xmath45 ) , leading charged track .",
    "the efficiency @xmath46 and the mistag fraction @xmath47 for each tagging algorithm is measured with fully reconstructed eigenstate decays .",
    "the effective efficiency is given by @xmath48 , where the babar and belle experiments report average measured values of ( @xmath49)% and ( @xmath50)% respectively .",
    "the decay rate as a function of @xmath36 is modified as a consequence of the tagging efficiency and also the convolution with the resolution function @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting decay rate becomes    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the @xmath7 lifetime .",
    "we look for asymmetries between @xmath18 and @xmath25 tagged events having a @xmath54 ) dependence with a known angular frequency @xmath30 and an amplitude that is given by @xmath55 multiplied by the dilution factor @xmath56 .",
    "the interesting physics lies within @xmath55 as it contains the factor @xmath32 which is common to all decay modes . depending on the decay mode under study , it is @xmath55 which is measured to help provide information on @xmath10 , @xmath15 or @xmath57 .",
    "considering decays @xmath60 ( @xmath58 or @xmath59 ) , the time dependent decay rate can be further written as    @xmath61,\\ ] ]    where the @xmath6 violating asymmetry parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 will be used throughout the document with subscripts referring to the decay in question . ]",
    "(= @xmath65 ) are expressed as @xmath63 = ( 1 @xmath66)/(1 + @xmath67 ) and @xmath62 = 2im@xmath68/(1 + @xmath67 ) , where @xmath68 is a parameter that depends on @xmath69 mixing and the amplitudes for @xmath18 and @xmath70 decaying to @xmath71 . if these decays proceed only via @xmath72 tree amplitudes , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ". if there are penguin contributions to the amplitude then @xmath62 = @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "a limit on the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath77 can be set using the grossman - quinn bound  @xcite which is    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the branching fraction of @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the branching fraction of @xmath82 .",
    "based on a dataset of 81  fb@xmath83 and 140  fb@xmath83 used by the babar and belle experiments respectively , the results in table  [ tab : pipi ] where obtained for the decay @xmath9 .",

    "given the semileptonic decay @xmath86 one can reconstruct the neutrino where then it is possible to measure the hadronic mass @xmath87  @xcite . in the case where @xmath88 the hadronic mass is greater than or equal to the mass of the @xmath89 meson .",
    "however when @xmath90 the hadronic mass distribution extends below the @xmath89 meson mass such that a cut @xmath91 significantly enhances the relative contribution @xmath72 compared to @xmath92 . a measurement of the rate can then be used directly to measure @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "this approach was first used by cleo  @xcite and is now being used by babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite .",
    "we can study the moments of the invariant mass distributions , @xmath93 and @xmath94 where the moments are extracted directly from the measured @xmath87 and @xmath95 distributions directly , taking into account corrections for mass scales , the detector efficiency and small residual backgrounds .",
