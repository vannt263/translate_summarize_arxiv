    "the threshold energy of the @xmath14 and @xmath1 reactions is above the second resonance region , which might be a good place to extract information of the less - explored higher nucleon resonances around @xmath15 gev .",
    "thus , the study of @xmath16 photoproduction becomes an interest topic in both experiment and theory .",
    "however , due to the small production rate for the @xmath16 via an electromagnetic probe , it had been a challenge for experiment to measure the @xmath16 production cross section in the photoproduction reaction  @xcite .",

    "they also predicted that effects of higher resonances in the @xmath4 shell might be observable in experiment .",
    "the dominant role of @xmath2 was also suggested by borasoy with the @xmath21 baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , and sibirtsev _ et al . _ with a hadronic model  @xcite . considering the interferences between @xmath2 and the background ( @xmath22 channel vector meson exchanges )",
    ", they gave a reasonable description of the old data . in 2003 chiang and yang developed a reggeized model for @xmath23 and @xmath16 photoproduction on protons  @xcite .",
    "in this model , the differential cross section data from  @xcite can be well described by the interference of an @xmath24 resonance with a mass in the range of @xmath25 gev and the @xmath22 channel regge trajectory exchanges . in 2004",
    "nakayama and haberzett  @xcite analyzed the differential cross section data from  @xcite within a relativistic meson exchange model of hadronic interactions .",
    "they predicted that the observed angular distribution is due to the interference between the @xmath22-channel and the nucleon resonances @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "although there are some hints of higher nucleon resonances in the @xmath16 photoproduction process , it is not straightforward to extract them based on the old data with large uncertainties .    with the rapid development in experiment ,",
    "recently , high - statistics and large - angle - coverage data for the @xmath14 reaction have been reported by the clas collaboration  @xcite and cbelsa / taps collaboration  @xcite , respectively .",
    "more recently , the measurements of the quasi - free photoproduction of @xmath16 mesons off nucleons bound in the deuteron were also carried out by the cbelsa / taps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the recent new data not only provide us a good opportunity to better understand the reaction mechanism but also allows us to carry out a detailed investigation of the less - explored higher nucleon resonances .",
    "motivated by the new high - precision cross - section data obtained by the clas collaboration  @xcite , nakayama and haberzett  @xcite updated their fits and found that higher resonances with @xmath28 might play important roles in reproducing the details of the measured angular distribution . a bump structure in the total cross around @xmath29 gev is predicted and might be caused by @xmath19 and/or @xmath30 . in the quark model",
    "li  @xcite and zhao  @xcite also found a bump structure around @xmath31 gev ( @xmath32 gev ) in the cross section by analyzing the old data .",
    "this structure comes from the @xmath4 terms in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the later higher - precision free proton data from the clas collaboration  @xcite indeed show a broad bump structure in the cross section around @xmath6 gev .",
    "this structure seems to also appear in the very recent quasi - free proton data and the data for inclusive quasi - free @xmath33 process  @xcite .    to clarify the structures from the above analyses and observations , we present a systemic analysis of the recent experimental data for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the framework of a chiral quark model as an improvement of the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the chiral quark model has been well developed and widely applied to meson photoproduction reactions  @xcite .",

    "recently , we applied this model to study @xmath23 photoproduction on the free and quasifree nucleons  @xcite .",
    "good descriptions of the observations were obtained . in this work ,",
    "we extend this approach to @xmath16 photoproduction .",
    "given that the @xmath16 and @xmath23 are mixing states of flavor singlet and octet in the su(3 ) flavor symmetry , we expect that some flavor symmetry relation can be applied to these two channels as a constraint on the model parameters .",
    "moreover , since @xmath16 production has a higher threshold , the determinations of the low - lying resonances in @xmath18 gev in the @xmath23 photoproduction would be useful for estimating their off - shell contributions in the @xmath16 photoproduction .",
    "similar to the @xmath23 production , an interesting difference between @xmath14 and @xmath1 is that in the @xmath36 reactions , contributions from states of representation @xmath37 $ ] will be forbidden by the moorhouse selection rule  @xcite in the su(6)@xmath38o(3 ) symmetry . as a consequence ,",

    "if a complete set of resonances are included in the @xmath42 and @xmath3 channels , the introduction of @xmath22-channel contributions might result in double counting  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it shows that the beam asymmetry for @xmath1 ( @xmath169 ) is quite similar to that of @xmath14 ( @xmath170 ) up to @xmath171 gev . in this energy region",
    "the beam asymmetry is nearly symmetric in the forward and backward directions . above @xmath172 gev",
    ", obvious differences show up between @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "it should be noted that the contribution of @xmath9 does not appear to be significant in the hadronic model studies .",
    "therefore , experimental measurement of the polarized beam asymmetries should provide a test for various models .    in brief , @xmath1 has features similar to those of @xmath14 .",
    "both reactions are dominated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 channel contributions .",
    "we predict that @xmath5 should have significant contributions to @xmath167 , and the polarized beam asymmetries might be sensitive to its presence in the transition amplitude .",
    "finally , we should point out that although @xmath149 has a significant contribution to @xmath173 process , its contributions to @xmath1 is negligible .",
    "in this work , we have studied the @xmath16 photo - production off the proton and neutron within a chiral quark model .",
    "a good description of the recent experimental data for both processes is achieved . due to the similar reaction mechanism for both processes",
    "it is understandable that some similar features exist in both reactions as manifested in the cross sections , excitation functions and polarized beam asymmetries .",
    "the large peak of the cross section around threshold for both processes mainly accounts for the constructive interferences between @xmath2 and the @xmath3-channel background",
    ". strong evidence of @xmath5 has been found in the reactions , with which we can naturedly explain the following recent high - statistics observations for the @xmath14 reaction from the clas collaboration : ( i ) the sudden change of the shape of the differential cross section around @xmath174 gev , ( ii ) the bump - like structure in the total cross section around @xmath6 gev ( @xmath172 gev ) , and ( iii ) the peak around @xmath6 gev in the excitation functions at very forward angles .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 also accounts for the bump - like structure at @xmath175 gev in the inclusive quasi - free @xmath176 cross section measured by cbelsa / taps .",
    "@xmath7 seems to be needed in the reaction , with which the total cross section near threshold for @xmath14 is improved slightly .",
    "however , the differential cross sections , excitation functions , and beam asymmetries are not sensitive to @xmath7 .",
    "to confirm @xmath7 , more accurate observations are needed .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that the polarized beam asymmetries are found to be sensitive to @xmath9 , although its effects on the differential cross sections and total cross sections are negligible .",
    "there is no obvious evidence of the @xmath10- , @xmath11- , @xmath12- , and @xmath13-wave resonances with a mass around 2.0 gev in the reactions .    to better understand the physics in the @xmath17 and @xmath1 reactions , we expect more accurate measurements of the following observables for both of the processes : ( i ) the total cross section in the energy region @xmath177 gev , ( ii ) the fixed - angle excitation functions at very forward angles from threshold up to @xmath178 gev , ( iii ) the differential cross sections in the energy region @xmath179 gev , and ( iv ) the beam asymmetries in the energy region @xmath180 gev",
