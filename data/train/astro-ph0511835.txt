    "as recalled by , `` systems where the stars are completely eclipsed are particularly important because they can provide robust measurements of the ratio of radii '' , @xmath1 .",
    "accurate determination of @xmath1 is indeed a well known problem in partially eclipsed systems .",
    "an impressive demonstration of this is provided by fig .  3 of .",
    "here , i draw attention to a few tens of totally eclipsing systems in the lmc , which would deserve spectroscopic observations for an orbit determination , and possibly additional photometric ones for a more accurate determination of radii and surface brightness ratio",
    ". such systems will be useful , not only for distance determination , but also for comparison with stellar structure models .",
    "from the sample of wyrzykowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on ogle photometry , we have selected a subsample of 510 binaries with @xmath2 , a depth of the secondary minimum @xmath3  mag and an ea type .",
    "this is the same sample as that used by north & zahn ( 2004 ) .",
    "all lightcurves were solved interactively with the ebop code , assuming a linear limb - darkening coefficient @xmath4 except in the few cases of clearly cool components . out of this sample",
    ", we selected visually 35 systems with clearly total eclipses .",
    "the fundamental stellar parameters were determined through interpolation in the evolutionary tracks of computed for a metal - content @xmath5 typical of the lmc .",
    "this was done as in , but without the hypothesis of identical components and assuming @xmath6 .",
    "the relative radii , orbital period and surface brightness ratio @xmath7 were used to constrain the solution .",
    "@xmath7 was calibrated in terms of ratio through the models of .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 and @xmath9 were determined simultaneously , using the measured @xmath10 index , following . the condition that both components lie on the same isochrone",
    "was not implemented , because of the presence of some post - mass exchange systems ; for the latter , the masses given are just those of single stars with same and luminosity , and therefore may be wrong . for main sequence systems lacking a @xmath10 index ,",
    "stellar parameters were determined in a cruder way , assuming both components lie on a @xmath11 isochrone .",
    "the of cool giants in a few systems were derived from the @xmath10 or the @xmath12 index assuming @xmath13 , while the masses were assumed identical to those of stars with same @xmath14 on the isochrone .",
    "some parameters of the @xmath0 dia lightcurve as well as and mass of the primary components are given in table  1 , a more complete version of which is available at the site ` http://obswww.unige.ch/~north/deb/tot_param ` .",
    "+ the errors are the formal ones given by the ebop code and give an idea of the quality of the fit , though one has to keep in mind that some parameters were kept fixed in the fit , so that the errors displayed are rather lower limits to the real uncertainties .",
    "many systems with total eclipses have also relatively shallow minima .",
    "although this might be due to 3rd light in some cases , this can not explain all of them .",
    "many such systems are certainly pairs of main sequence stars with a relatively small ratio of masses and radii . among them , those for which @xmath15 are especially interesting : they are composed of two stars close to the turn - off , with an evolved primary and an unevolved secondary .",
    "the ratio of radii is often near @xmath16 .",
    "such systems allow to probe efficiently the global metallicity and helium content of each component  as far as the stellar structure models can be trusted  according to the method of .",
    "since the metallicity of the lmc is less than half that of the sun , this can potentially improve the @xmath17 relation obtained by ribas et al .",
    "on the basis of galactic systems . adding totally eclipsing systems of the smc",
    "will further improve the determination of this relation , even providing an independent estimate of the primordial he abundance through extrapolation to zero metallicity",
    ".    however , the great interest of these systems has a price as regard to spectroscopic observations : the small @xmath1 implies a small luminosity ratio  especially in the blue ( @xmath18 domain of choice because of the number of spectral lines ) if the secondary is cooler than the primary  so that high s / n spectra will be needed",
    ". the uves instrument on the vlt , used with a wide slit , may be appropriate .",
    "another possibility would be the use of flames - giraffe in the ifu `` low '' resolution mode ( @xmath19 ) , which would allow to observe a few systems simultaneously .",
