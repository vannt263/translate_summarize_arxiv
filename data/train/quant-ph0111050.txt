    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the most general admissible boundary conditions for the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect in the plane on the background of a homogeneous magnetic field , and also to investigate the basic properties of hamiltonians obtained this way .",
    "the history of the effect goes four decades back and starts from the observation of aharonov and bohm @xcite that the behavior of a charged quantum particle is influenced by a magnetic flux even if the field is zero in the region where the particle is localized .",
    "a particularly elegant treatment is possible in case of an idealized setup in which the ab flux is concentrated along a line perpendicularly intersecting the plane , conventionally at the origin @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions of the last mentioned paper are not the most general ones ; the full family of such conditions giving the ab effect in the plane was derived in @xcite , and simultaneously also in @xcite .",
    "these generalised boundary conditions may be interpreted as a combination of the ab effect with a point interaction supported , too , at the origin , although this is just one possible point of view . in any case",
    "they can be described and investigated by the technique of self - adjoint extensions which is in principle the same one as that used in the paper @xcite in which two - dimensional point interactions were introduced .",
    "a natural question is what happens if such a system is placed into a background homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "this problem attracted some attention recently , even with a controversy : the papers @xcite consider the `` pure '' ab effect in this setting for the pauli operator , i.e. a spin @xmath3 particle .",
    "the last named property leads to specific behavior related to the aharonov - casher effect , which we will not discuss here .",
    "our aim here is different : we are going to consider a spinless particle with a point flux and a homogeneous background , and ask about the most general class of boundary conditions analogous to those of @xcite .",
    "the basic difference between the situations without and with a homogeneous magnetic field is that in the former case the spectrum is absolutely continuous and equal to the positive half - line possibly augmented with at most two negative eigenvalues ( depending on the choice of boundary conditions ) while in the latter case the spectrum is pure point and the point flux and interaction gives rise to eigenvalues in each gap between neighboring landau levels .",
    "our goal is to discuss these spectral properties in detail .",
    "we consider the symmetric operator @xmath4 where the vector potential @xmath5 is a sum of two parts , @xmath6 , with the part @xmath7 corresponding to the homogeneous magnetic field in the circular gauge , @xmath8 and with the part @xmath9 corresponding to the idealised ab effect , @xmath10 without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath11 .",
    "further , we rescale the aharonov - bohm flux , @xmath12 to have a variable which expresses the number of flux quanta and , as usual , we make use of the gauge symmetry allowing us to assume that @xmath130,1[\\ ,   $ ] . hence the case @xmath14 is excluded since it is gauge equivalent to the vanishing ab flux .",
    "our goal is to describe all the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath15 as well as to investigate their basic properties .",
    "it is straightforward to determine the adjoint operator @xmath16 , @xmath17 next we can employ the rotational symmetry when using the polar coordinates @xmath18 and decomposing the hilbert space into the orthogonal sum of the eigenspaces of the angular momentum , @xmath19 in the polar coordinates the operator @xmath15 ( and correspondingly @xmath16 ) takes the form @xmath20 the operator @xmath16 commutes on @xmath21 with the projectors @xmath22 onto the eigenspaces of the angular momentum , @xmath23 and therefore @xmath16 decomposes in correspondence with the orthogonal sum ( [ ogsum ] ) , @xmath24    thus we can reduce the problem and work in the sectors @xmath25 , @xmath26 . for a given spectral parameter @xmath27",
    "we choose two independent solutions ( except of particular values of @xmath28 ) of the differential equation @xmath29 namely @xmath30 where @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are confluent hypergeometric functions ( * ? ? ?",
    "13 ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35    notice that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are linearly dependent if and only if @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , @xmath36 is an entire function , particularly , it is regular at the origin while @xmath37 has a singularity there provided @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and in that case it holds true that @xmath41 thus in the case when @xmath42 we have the asymptotic behaviour , as @xmath43 , @xmath44    we shall also need some information about the asymptotic behaviour at infinity . when @xmath45 it holds true that @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "with the above preliminaries it is straightforward to solve the spectral problem for the standard ab hamiltonian as we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this means to solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath48 with the boundary condition @xmath49 by virtue of the decomposition ( [ decompl ] ) the problem is reduced to the countable set of equations @xmath50 and hence to the differential equations ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "the solution @xmath51 of ( [ eqm ] ) is ruled out because it contradicts the condition ( [ bc ] ) and the solution @xmath52 belongs to @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "since it holds @xmath56 we get a countable set of eigenvalues , @xmath57 with the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the normalisation constants .",
    "as it is well known if we fix @xmath26 then the functions @xmath60 form an orthonormal basis in @xmath61 and so the complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath62 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath63,{\\mathrm{d}}\\theta ) $ ] .",
    "since all the eigenvalues @xmath64 are real we get this way a well defined self - adjoint operator which is an extension of @xmath15 .",
    "we conventionally call it the standard ab hamiltonian and denote it by @xmath65 .",
    "thus the spectrum of @xmath65 is pure point and can be written as a union of two parts , @xmath66 notice that the eigenvalues belonging to the first part are nothing but the landau levels .",
    "all the eigenvalues @xmath67 have infinite multiplicities while the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath68 is finite and equals @xmath69 .",
    "a final short remark concerning the hamiltonian @xmath70 is devoted to the green function .",
    "naturally , the green function is expressible as an infinite series @xmath71 where @xmath72 the radial parts can be rewritten with the aid of the standard construction of the green function for ordinary differential operators of second order , @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "this amounts to the identity @xmath77 we do not expect that a simpler form for the green function could be derived since the hamiltonian @xmath70 enjoys only the rotational symmetry .",
    "recalling what has been summarised in section [ problem - prelim ] it is easy to determine the deficiency indices . the solution @xmath79 diverges exponentially at infinity ( cf .",
    "( [ asf ] ) ) while @xmath80 behaves well at infinity but has a singularity at the origin of the order @xmath81 . thus @xmath82 if and only if @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "this means that the deficiency indices are @xmath85 .",
    "for a basis in the deficiency subspaces @xmath86 we can choose @xmath87 thus @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are normalisation constants making the basis orthonormal .",
    "we shall need the explicit values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . using the relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the whittaker function we get @xmath93 where @xmath94 combining the identities @xcite @xmath95 and @xmath96 we arrive at the relation@xmath97 finally we get @xmath98",
    "let us have a look at the asymptotic behaviour at the origin of the basis functions in the deficiency subspaces @xmath86 . by ( [ gm ] ) and ( [ gasym ] )",
    "we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 the coefficients @xmath101 , @xmath102 are related to the normalisation constants @xmath103 for it holds true that @xmath104 where @xmath105 particularly , we shall need the fact that the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 are regular .",
    "let us now describe the closure of the operator @xmath15 . in virtue of the decomposition ( [ decompl ] ) we have@xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "as it is well known , @xmath110 belongs to @xmath111 if and only if @xmath112 for all @xmath113 .",
    "thus @xmath114 for @xmath115 , and if @xmath116 then @xmath117 belongs to @xmath118 if and only if @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the wronskian . using the asymptotic behaviour ( [ as ] ) and the regularity of the matrix @xmath121 we arrive at two conditions @xmath122 which can be rewritten in the equivalent form , @xmath123 but",
    "since @xmath1240,r[}|x^{-2|m+\\alpha |+1 } \\partial _ { x}(x^{|m+\\alpha |}\\varphi ( x))|\\ ] ] we finally get a sufficient and necessary condition for @xmath117 to belong to @xmath111 , namely @xmath125    this shows that if @xmath126 then @xmath127 let us formally introduce the functionals @xmath128 on @xmath21 , @xmath129 notice that the upper index refers to the sector of angular momentum while the lower index refers to the order of the singularity .",
    "if @xmath130 then according to ( [ cl ] ) it actually holds @xmath131 for @xmath132 , @xmath133 . on the other hand , if @xmath134 and @xmath131 for all indices @xmath132 , @xmath133 , then @xmath135 ( this is again guaranteed by the regularity of the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) .",
    "let us introduce some more notation .",
    "it is convenient to arrange the functionals @xmath136 into column vectors as follows,@xmath137 further , applying the functionals to the basis functions in @xmath138 we obtain four @xmath139 diagonal matrices .",
    "more precisely , set @xmath140 then @xmath141    now it is straightforward to give a formal definition of a self - adjoint extension @xmath142 of the symmetric operator @xmath15 determined by a unitary operator @xmath143 .",
    "we identify @xmath144 with a unitary @xmath139 matrix via the choice of the orthonormal bases @xmath145 in @xmath86.the self - adjoint operator @xmath142 is unambiguously defined by the condition : @xmath146 and @xmath110 belongs to @xmath147 if and only if@xmath148 however condition ( [ ran ] ) is rather inconvenient and we shall replace it in the next section by another one which is more suitable for practical purposes .",
    "to turn ( [ ran ] ) into a convenient requirement which would involve boundary conditions we shall need the following proposition .",
    "set @xmath149 _ _ there is a one - to - one correspondence between unitary matrices @xmath150 and couples of matrices @xmath151 obeying@xmath152 and@xmath153 modulo the right action of the group of regular matrices @xmath154 .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence is given by the equality__@xmath155    let us note that the equivalence class of a couple @xmath156 modulo @xmath154 corresponds to a two - dimensional subspace in @xmath157 and hence to a point in the grassmann manifold @xmath158 .",
    "the complex dimension of @xmath158 equals 4 , i.e. @xmath159 . the points of @xmath158 obeying the ( `` real '' ) condition ( [ re ] ) form a real 4-dimensional submanifold which is diffeomorphic , according to the proposition , to the unitary group @xmath160 .    to verify the proposition",
    "we first show that to any couple @xmath156 with the properties ( [ two ] ) , ( [ re ] ) there are related unique @xmath161 and @xmath150 such that @xmath162 where we have set@xmath163 using ( [ det ] ) one easily finds that @xmath164 is regular and @xmath165 let us introduce another couple of matrices , @xmath166 , by the relation@xmath167 thus @xmath168 .",
    "it follows that @xmath169 and , consequently , @xmath170 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 commute ( all of them are diagonal ) , @xmath173 and@xmath174 ( cf .",
    "( [ det ] ) ) . owing to the property ( [ re ] ) we have @xmath175 which jointly with the property ( [ two ] ) implies that @xmath176 the only possible choice of the matrices @xmath177 and @xmath144 satisfying ( [ yu ] ) is@xmath178 the matrix @xmath144 is actually unitary because of ( [ vv ] ) .",
    "conversely , we have to show that any couple of matrices @xmath179 , @xmath180 related to a unitary matrix @xmath144 according to the rule@xmath181 obeys ( [ two ] ) and ( [ re ] ) .",
    "condition ( [ two ] ) is obvious since @xmath164 is regular and condition ( [ re ] ) is again a matter of a direct computation . in more detail ,",
    "since it holds@xmath182 it suffices to verify that @xmath183 this concludes the proof of the above proposition .    using this correspondence one can relate to a couple @xmath151 obeying ( [ two ] ) and ( [ re ] ) a self - adjoint extension @xmath184 determined by the condition @xmath185 two couples @xmath156 and @xmath186 determine the same self - adjoint extension if and only if there exists a regular matrix @xmath177 such that @xmath187 .",
    "moreover , all the self - adjoint extensions can be obtained in this way .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to an open dense subset in the space of all self - adjoint extensions by requiring the matrix @xmath180 to be regular . in that case",
    "we can set directly @xmath188 and rename @xmath189 .",
    "thus @xmath190 is a @xmath139 complex matrix satisfying @xmath191 the corresponding self - adjoint extension will be denoted @xmath192 .",
    "the condition ( [ dom ] ) simplifies in an obvious way .",
    "we conclude that @xmath193 and @xmath110 belongs to @xmath194 if and only if @xmath195 and this is in fact the sought boundary condition .",
    "matrices @xmath190 obeying ( [ dlambda ] ) can be parametrised by four real parameters ( or two real and one complex ) .",
    "we choose the parameterisation@xmath196 the relation between @xmath190 and @xmath144 reads@xmath197 ( provided the rhs makes sense ) .",
    "the `` most regular '' among the boundary conditions is @xmath198 , i.e. the one determined by @xmath199 , and the corresponding self - adjoint extension is nothing but the standard aharonov - bohm hamiltonian @xmath65 discussed in section [ standardhamilton ] .",
    "according to ( [ lambdau ] ) @xmath65 corresponds to the unitary matrix @xmath200",
    "let us now proceed to the discussion of spectral properties of the described self - adjoint extensions .",
    "it is clear from what has been explained up to now that everything interesting is happening in the two critical sectors of the angular momentum labeled by @xmath83 and @xmath84 . to state it more formally we decompose the hilbert space into an orthogonal sum of the `` stable '' and `` critical '' parts , @xmath201 where @xmath202 a self - adjoint extension @xmath192 decomposes correspondingly , @xmath203 and we know that on @xmath204 the operator @xmath192 coincides with the standard ab hamiltonian,@xmath205    thus @xmath206 and , as explained in section [ standardhamilton ] , @xmath207 where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath67 is infinite while the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath208 equals @xmath209 . on the other hand , @xmath210 where all the eigenvalues are simple ( the first set is a contribution of the sector @xmath83 while the second one comes from the sector @xmath84 ) .",
    "since the deficiency indices are finite the krein s formula jointly with weyl theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem xiii.14 ) tells us that the essential spectrum @xmath211 is empty for any @xmath190 .",
    "thus the spectrum of @xmath212 is formed by eigenvalues which are at most finitely degenerated and have no finite accumulation points .",
    "let us derive the equation on eigenvalues for the restriction @xmath212 .",
    "let @xmath213 . in each of the sectors",
    "@xmath214 there exists exactly one ( up to a multiplicative constant ) solution of the equation @xmath215 which is @xmath216-integrable at infinity ( with respect to the measure @xmath217 ) and we may take for it the function @xmath218 ( cf .",
    "( [ gm ] ) ) . for",
    "a second linearly independent solution one may take @xmath219 provided @xmath220 ( cf .",
    "( [ beta ] ) ) . if @xmath221 then a possible choice of a second linearly independent solution is @xmath222 where@xmath223 ( cf .",
    "( [ gf ] ) ) .",
    "thus @xmath28 is an eigenvalue of @xmath212 if and only if there exists a vector @xmath224 such that the function @xmath225 satisfies the boundary condition ( [ bcfinal ] ) . using again ( [ gm ] ) and ( [ gasym ] ) one finds that @xmath226 where @xmath227 this immediately leads to the desired equation on eigenvalues which takes the form @xmath228 where@xmath229 after the substitution @xmath230 we get @xmath231 to simplify somewhat the form of the equation it is convenient to rescale the parameters as follows , @xmath232 finally we arrive at an equation depending on three real parameters @xmath233 , namely @xmath234    there is no chance to solve equation ( [ ev ] ) explicitly apart of some particular cases .",
    "one of them , of course , corresponds to the standard ab hamiltonian .",
    "this case is determined by the values of parameters @xmath235 and the roots of ( [ ev ] ) form the set @xmath236 .",
    "consider also the case when when @xmath237 and @xmath238 with the set of roots equal to @xmath239 .",
    "comparing the latter case to the former one we see that there is one additional root , namely @xmath240 , which escapes to infinity when @xmath241 .    in the last particular case one can also consider the limit @xmath242 .",
    "more generally , suppose that @xmath243 , i.e. @xmath244 , replace @xmath190 with @xmath245 in ( [ bcfinal ] ) and take the limit @xmath246 .",
    "the limiting boundary condition reads@xmath247 and the corresponding self - adjoint extension which we shall call @xmath248 is one of those omitted when we restricted ourselves to an open dense subset in the space of all self - adjoint extensions ( regarded as a a 4-dimensional real manifold ) .",
    "equation ( [ ev ] ) reduces in this limit to the equation@xmath249 with the set of roots @xmath250    another case when equation ( [ ev ] ) simplifies though it is not solvable explicitly is @xmath251 .",
    "this is easy to understand since if @xmath251 then the matrix @xmath190 is diagonal and the two critical sectors of angular momentum do not interfere .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the equation ( [ ev ] ) splits into two independent equations , @xmath252    let us shortly discuss the dependence of roots of equation ( [ ev ] ) on the parameters @xmath233 .",
    "since the derivative of the lhs of ( [ ev ] ) with respect to @xmath253 and with the values of parameters @xmath254 equals @xmath255 where @xmath256 , the standard implicit function theorem ( analytic case ) is sufficient to conclude that the roots are analytic functions in @xmath233 at least in some neighbourhood of the origin ( depending in general on the root ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath257 and @xmath258 the roots of ( [ ev ] ) regarded as analytic functions in @xmath233 and such that @xmath259 and @xmath260 , with @xmath256 . a straightforward computation results in the following power series truncated at degree 4 .",
    "set @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the euler constant , @xmath263 is the digamma function and @xmath264 is the zeta function . then @xmath265 @xmath266    a similar analysis can be carried out to get the asymptotic behaviour of roots for @xmath233 large .",
    "to this end assume that @xmath244 and set @xmath267 notice that @xmath268 .",
    "equation ( [ ev ] ) becomes @xmath269 roots of ( [ evinf ] ) are analytic functions in @xmath270 at least in some neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "again , it would be possible to compute the beginning of the corresponding power series and to derive formulae similar to those of ( [ trun1 ] ) , ( [ trun2 ] ) but we avoid doing it here explicitly .",
    "instead we prefer to plot two graphs in order to give a reader some impression about how the eigenvalues may depend on the parameters , i.e. on the boundary conditions . in each graph",
    "we choose a line in the parameter space , @xmath271 , and we depict the dependence on @xmath272 of several first eigenvalues for the corresponding self - adjoint extension restricted to @xmath273 ( see ( [ subs ] ) for the substitution ) . in the both graphs we have set @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "probably the most complete general information which is available about solutions of equation ( [ ev ] ) might be a localisation of roots of this equation with respect to a suitable splitting of the real line into intervals .",
    "let us choose the splitting into intervals with boundary points coinciding with the roots of equation ( [ rinf ] ) .",
    "to get the localisation let us rewrite equation ( [ ev ] ) , equivalently provided @xmath276 , as follows    @xmath277    put @xmath278 so that equation ( [ evloc ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath279    it is easy to carry out some basic analysis of the function @xmath280 .",

    "let us note that this localisation is in agreement with a general result according to which if @xmath5 and @xmath317 are two self - adjoint extensions of the same symmetric operator with finite deficiency indices @xmath318 then any interval @xmath319 not intersecting the spectrum of @xmath5 contains at most @xmath320 eigenvalues of the operator @xmath317 ( including multiplicities ) and no other part of the spectrum of @xmath317 @xcite .",

    "the above discussion does not exhaust all questions related to the system under consideration .",
    "one may ask , for instance , how the state of such a particle evolves under an adiabatic change of parameters .",

    "<S> the most general admissible boundary conditions are derived for an idealised aharonov - bohm flux intersecting the plane at the origin on the background of a homogeneous magnetic field . a standard technique based on self - adjoint extensions </S>",
    "<S> yields a four - parameter family of boundary conditions ; other two parameters of the model are the aharonov - bohm flux and the homogeneous magnetic field . the generalised boundary conditions may be regarded as a combination of the aharonov - bohm effect with a point interaction . </S>",
