    "a subcluster is defined as any cluster smaller than @xmath80 that can be embedded in cluster @xmath80 .",
    "this scheme can be used to develop power series expansions , such as high temperature series expansions in powers of inverse temperature @xmath81 , or , some coupling constant expansion ( such as expansion in inverse field - strength ) .",
    "it can also be used to numerically calculate properties for a given value of temperature and coupling constants , as we do in the present work .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice is a lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra and it proves useful to develop nlc in terms of clusters consisting of complete tetrahedra .",
    "we have calculated temperature and field - dependent properties up to @xmath82 order , that is , including contributions from all clusters made of up to @xmath51 tetrahedra .",

    "the parameter region where nlc begins to lose accuracy is when the temperature and the applied field ( zeeman energy ) are both smaller than the exchange constants .",
    "thus , as long as either the high temperature expansion or the high - field expansion converges , the nlc calculations should be highly accurate .",
    "the reason for developing nlc in terms of complete tetrahedra comes from the fact that , for spin ice systems , the ` ice rule ' constraints at the origin of spin ice physics are local to tetrahedra .",
    "thus , having clusters with only parts of a tetrahedron would cause wild oscillations in the calculated properties as the constraints can not be satisfied for such a cluster . having only clusters with full",
    "tetrahedra allows the system to always satisfy the ice - rule constraint .",
    "for example , in the case of the classical nearest - neighbor spin - ice exchange model , such a tetrahedra - based nlc was found to be highly accurate .",
    "@xcite in fact , the first order nlc , which uses a single tetrahedron and is equivalent to pauling s approximation for the entropy of ice , gives quantities at all temperatures ( in zero external field ) that are accurate to a few percent .",
    "@xcite    however , in the quantum spin ice problem , nlc must break down at low temperatures due to the development of either long - range correlations or long - range entanglement .",
    "we have found ( see results below and in ref .  [ ] ) that the first signature of such a breakdown in the low temperature and low field region is an alternation of the thermodynamic property @xmath75 considered .",
    "this reflects the fact that , as system sizes increase , the thermodynamic properties must approach their infinite size values in some way .",
    "now , imagine that , at some order , the numerically calculated property is a bit too large , giving rise to a large cluster weight @xmath88 .",
    "subcluster subtraction then causes the weight in the subsequent order to be too small .",

    "it would thus be interesting to invesgitate its validity via @xmath175 experimental measurements .    to summarize , the rather large anisotropic exchange interactions at play in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 lead to the development of a collective paramagnetic state at @xmath187 k with @xmath188 , being thus somewhat `` hidden '' and difficult to quantitatively describe using standard textbook ( e.g. rpa and other mean - field like ) methods .",
    "in this material , and perhaps in other candidate quantum spin ice materials , the fit of bulk thermodynamic data such as @xmath175 and @xmath6 using nlc may provide a useful alternative .",
    "in this paper we have compared the results from numerical linked - cluster ( nlc ) calculations of the temparature and magnetic field dependent magnetization of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 with those obtained from experimental measurements on this material in a temperature range @xmath189 $ ] k and magnetic field range @xmath190 $ ] t. the nlc calculations were performed on a hamiltonian describing the interactions between pseudospins @xmath191 and characterized by effective anisotropic exchange couplings determined via inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements in the polarized paramagnetic state of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the overall agreement between the nlc and the experimental results were found to be excellent ( see fig .  [ fig:3panels ] ) .",
    "conversely , nlc magnetization results obtained using the exchange couplings determined from a random phase approximation analysis of the diffuse paramagnetic neutron scattering  @xcite were found to be in significant disagreement with the experimental magnetization measurements .",
    "the excellent argreement between nlc and experimental measurements of @xmath6 shows that ( i ) the proposed nearest - neighbor exchange model  @xcite is quantitatively accurate to describe yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , that ( ii ) high - field inelastic scattering in the polarized paramagnetic state is a reliable method for extracting effective exchange parameters and that ( iii ) long - range dipolar interactions appear to not play an important role in the energetics of the system .",
    "the latter conclusion is perhaps a bit surprising given that long - range dipolar interactions play a key role in the physics of classical ( dipolar ) spin ices .",
    "@xcite one obvious difference is that , relative to the @xmath89 effective exchange interaction , the nearest - neighbor contribution of the magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than in the classical dipolar spin ices .",
    "@xcite at the very least , one may consider that the nearest - neighbor contribution of the dipolar interactions are incorporated in the @xmath139 effective anisotropic exchange .",
    "then , it thus appears that the perturbative long - range ( beyond nearest - neighbor ) part of the dipolar interactions plays no dramatic role in a field greater than 0.2 t and down to 1.8 k ( this work ) or , in zero field , down to approximately 0.7 k as found in ref .",
    "it may be that , if yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 does possess a ferrimagnetically ordered state with a magnetization along of the @xmath192 axes , that the sole role of dipolar interactions is to weakly renormalize the critical temperature and the level of quantum fluctuations , along with inducing ferrimagnetic domains . yet , perhaps one should not be too expedient in assuming a generic irrelevance of long - range dipolar interactions of order @xmath193 compared to @xmath89 for any candidate quantum spin ice material .",
    "one can imagine that dipolar interactions may play an important role , possibly inducing novel phases , in a material that would , based solely on its effective anisotropic exchange couplings @xmath139 , find itself at the boundary between the various semi - classical and intrinsically quantum phases identified in mean - field lattice gauge theories of quantum spin ices .",
    "@xcite    we believe that it would be , at this time , very interesting and most useful to carry out similar studies that combine inelastic neutron scattering and thermodynamic bulk measurements for other candidate quantum spin ice materials , with yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and yb@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 being obvious choices . from the lessons learned in the present work , as well as from ref .",
    "[ ] , we anticipate that nlc will contribute to developing a quantative parametrization of microscopic models of quantum spin ices and help pave the way for an ultimate understanding of these fascinating systems .",
    "however , for this program to be successful , the availability of large high resolution inelastic neutron scattering data sets will likely prove to be essential . in parallel , in - field single crystal measurements which properly account for demagnetization effects will also be necessary . to end on yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , we believe that , notwithstanding the evidence presented here and elsewhere  @xcite , it is by no means certain  @xcite at this time that long - range ferrimagnetic order develops below 0.26 k  @xcite in this very interesting material .",
    "more experiments on well - characterized samples are needed to settle this question .",

    "the pairwise interactions themselves could be ferromagnetic but be frustrated by strong local single - ion anisotropy with local axis that form an angle larger than 90@xmath194 , as arises in spin ice compounds . in that case , the _ effective _ interactions can be said to be antiferromagnetic .",
