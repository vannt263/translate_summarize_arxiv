    "the fagnano s problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is an optimization problem that was first stated by giovanni fagnano in 1775 :            [ fag1 ] in figure [ fig : fg6a ] , suppose @xmath0 is an acute - angled triangle , then , the of smallest perimeter triangle @xmath1 can be inscribed in @xmath0 is a right triangle if and only if @xmath0 has only one @xmath2 angle . in addition , the right angle @xmath3 and the @xmath2 angle are opposite angles , which means here , @xmath4 .",
    "according to the answer above , the @xmath1 is the orthic triangle of @xmath0 , and it s also known that the incenter of the orthic triangle @xmath1 is the orthocenter of @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . now , suppose @xmath1 is a right triangle with @xmath5 , then in @xmath1 , we have @xmath6 @xmath7 then we get @xmath8 and in the quadrilateral @xmath9 , we have @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 with @xmath5 , we conclude @xmath4 , and obviously , an acute - angled triangle can only have one @xmath2 angle , and also , it s easy to see that the right angle @xmath3 and @xmath13 are opposite angles .          in figure [",
    "fig : fg6b ] , @xmath14 is a golden rectangle with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , made up of a unit square @xmath17 and a small golden rectangle @xmath18 , then the of smallest perimeter triangle @xmath19 that can be inscribed in the acute - angled triangle @xmath20 is a right triangle having sides proportional to @xmath21@xcite .",
    "it s easy to see that @xmath20 is an acute - angled triangle with @xmath4 , and according to theorem [ fag1 ] , the orthic triangle @xmath19 is a right triangle with @xmath22 . since @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 and get @xmath25 , then apply the law of cosines to @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 and get @xmath28 . using the similar method , we can get @xmath29 , hence @xmath30 .      fagnano s problem , _ wikipedia , the free encyclopedia _ , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fagnano_problem .",
