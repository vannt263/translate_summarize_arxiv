    "+    consistent with our previous observations , @xmath72 was seen to vanish with small errors across the full range of temperatures considered .",
    "the diagonal qrc was negative and differed significantly from zero , as shown in figure [ fg.nf2 ] . for comparison ,",
    "results from the quenched theory at the same bare quark mass are also shown .",
    "the @xmath6-dependence is seen to be a little different ; this could reflect either the difference in the value of @xmath135 or be a quenching artifact .",
    "the off - diagonal qrc ( see figure [ fg.cs11 ] ) is consistent with zero within small errors above @xmath5 . near and below @xmath5 larger fluctuations are seen .",
    "although still consistent with zero at the 3-@xmath118 level , the averages increase by several orders of magnitude compared to @xmath62 , and seem to be comparable in magnitude to the diagonal qrc .",
    "the results of our preliminary investigation of the continuum limit with dynamical quarks are shown in figure [ fg.nf2conti ] . at @xmath188",
    "the 3-@xmath118 error band on the extrapolation of the diagonal qrc is consistent with zero . at @xmath5",
    "the continuum extrapolation perforce had to be performed with data from only two lattice spacings .",
    "these completely fix the parameters of a linear extrapolation to the continuum .",
    "error estimates were obtained by then taking the slope as this given parameter and estimating the error on the continuum value in the usual way .",
    "the resulting 1-@xmath118 and 3-@xmath118 error limits on the extrapolation are shown in figure [ fg.nf2conti ] .",
    "another estimate is to take the extrapolations of the upper end of one error bar and the lower end of the other .",
    "this lies within the 3-@xmath118 band given . with all these caveats ,",
    "our data currently points to a non - zero continuum extrapolation of renormalized @xmath73 at @xmath5 .",
    "the chiral condensate is a derivative of the free energy density with respect to quark mass ( eq .  [ cond ] ) , and the latter requires renormalization . as a result , so does the condensate and its taylor coefficients .",
    "we have defined two renormalization schemes for staggered quarks ( eq .  [ scheme ] ) in order to set up a well defined taylor series expansion for the chiral condensate as a function of the chemical potential @xmath1 ( eqs .",
    "[ ctaylor ] and [ conds ] ) .",
    "diagrammatic rules for writing down the operators defining the taylor coefficients have been given ( figure [ fg.chicnd ] ) .",
    "the first order taylor coefficient , @xmath72 vanishes by symmetry .",
    "the two qrcs are related through maxwell relations and chiral ward identities to all other second order taylor coefficients in the chiral sector ( eqs .  [ maxwell ] ) .",
    "the diagonal qrc , @xmath73 , has small errors and is easily measurable at the renormalized quark mass we used .",
    "we found that at finite lattice cutoff it is negative .",
    "away from @xmath5 , both in quenched and @xmath0 qcd , the continuum limit of this quantity vanishes .",
    "we have presented evidence ( figure [ fg.nf2conti ] ) that near @xmath5 in the @xmath0 theory it does not vanish .",
    "this negative peak in @xmath73 ( figures [ fg.nf2 ] and [ fg.nf2conti ] ) corresponds to a significant shift of the condensate , and hence @xmath107 , with chemical potential .",
    "the implications for strangeness production have been pointed out in section [ sc.maxwell ] . here",
    "we discuss how measurements of the diagonal and off - diagonal qrcs , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , test current conjectures about the phase diagram of qcd at small @xmath1 based on the perturbative expansion or model computations @xcite .",
    "the location of @xmath5 is often identified through a peak in the scalar susceptibility @xmath109 ( which is the same as the mass derivative of the chiral condensate through the patel ward identity @xcite ) . in the chiral limit",
    "this is an unique definition , since the direction of spontaneous symmetry breaking at low @xmath6 makes this a massive particle , which becomes massless precisely at @xmath5 .",
    "however , at finite quark mass the symmetry is explicitly broken , @xmath107 is finite throughout the low @xmath6 phase and there is a cross over instead of a critical point along the @xmath6 axis at @xmath5 @xcite , as shown in the top panel of figure [ fg.phsdg ] ( see however , @xcite ) .",
    "the cross over temperature @xmath5 is usually not uniquely defined , in the following sense . at a phase transition",
    "different physical quantities give exactly the same estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "this is no longer true at a cross over .",
    "thus the slight shift in the peak of @xmath73 ( figure [ fg.nf2 ] ) compared to @xmath5 previously defined from peaks in @xmath109 and the wilson line susceptibilities @xcite lends some support to the scenario of a cross over .",
    "furthermore , the observed negative peak in the quadratic response of the condensate shows that @xmath107 decreases at finite @xmath1 , and hence pions can not be the soft mode as one approaches the critical end point . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first such indication from lattice qcd .",
    "unless @xmath73 changes sign in the continuum , this argument continues to hold .",
    "we have presented evidence that it does , because the diagonal qrc does not turn positive in the vicinity of @xmath5 ( figure [ fg.nf2conti ] ) .",
    "thus support for the standard picture of the phase diagram for @xmath189 is provided by @xmath73 in two different ways by indicating that at @xmath3 there could be a cross over , and by showing that pion fluctuations decrease as the baryon density increases .",
    "it is interesting to see what else the qrcs can say about the phase diagram . for @xmath189 , as @xmath6 decreases ,",
    "the taylor series for @xmath54 will eventually hit the critical end point in an extrapolation in @xmath49 @xcite , and the critical line in @xmath51 @xcite ( see upper panels in figure [ fg.phsdg ] ) .",
    "therefore , at lower @xmath6 there must be differences in the two extrapolations .",
    "this can only happen if the off - diagonal qrc becomes significant .",
    "we have shown preliminary evidence for this in figure [ fg.cs11 ] .",
    "this should become easier to measure with decreasing @xmath164 since @xmath126 as well as the chemical potential at the critical end point are expected to decrease .    in the chiral limit the phase diagram in the @xmath6-@xmath49 plane",
    "is expected @xcite to contain a critical line meeting the @xmath6 axis at a critical point @xmath5 .",
    "it is also expected that this critical line ends in a tri - critical point where it meets a line of first order phase transitions emerging from the @xmath49 axis ( see lower panels in figure [ fg.phsdg ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath6-@xmath51 plane has been explored in @xcite .",
    "a second critical line is expected to emerge from the @xmath6 axis , curving down to eventually touch the @xmath51 axis @xcite .",
    "since there is a unique transition along the @xmath6-axis for @xmath190 , one expects both critical lines to start from @xmath5 .",
    "a taylor expansion can not be started at the critical point @xmath5 , but it is possible to make such a series expansion immediately above and below , and thus track the curvature of the two critical lines .",
    "if the off - diagonal qrc vanishes , then the physics along these two lines is the same .",
    "however , one has massless pions , whereas the other does not .",
    "also , at lower temperature , one series should give evidence of a tri - critical point on extrapolation , whereas the other should not .",
    "thus , if the phase diagrams drawn above are accurate , then they should be reflected by a non - vanishing value of the off - diagonal qrc .",
    "further , measurements of @xmath191 would give information on the soft modes in these two directions .",
    "thus , there are several extensions of this study which would be interesting to perform in the future .",
    "first , the chiral extrapolation of @xmath73 and @xmath74 obtained at fixed @xmath116 by varying @xmath164 would indicate whether the tri - critical point indeed appears at @xmath63 .",
    "if the standard picture does hold , then the chiral extrapolation of @xmath192 and @xmath193 at @xmath6 just below @xmath5 would give information on the soft modes along the two critical lines .",
