    "spin , the elementary unit responsible for magnetism , is essentially a quantum mechanical property.@xcite the most stable state for an antiferromagnetic spin pair ( dimer ) is the spinless singlet state . as the wave function of the singlet state is an entanglement of up - down and down - up spin states ,",
    "there is no classical analogue .",
    "nevertheless , most antiferromagnets , in which the magnetic ions form a uniform three - dimensional lattice , can be well described by a classical ( trivial ) model of an alternating arrangement of antiparallel spins.@xcite systems in which geometrical constraints prevent the formation of such a trivial structure have received considerable attention in recent years . in such systems , known as frustrated magnets ,",
    "quantum behaviors are particularly enhanced.@xcite the simplest example of a frustrated system is a triangle of three spins that interact antiferromagnetically .",
    "this configuration clearly precludes stable resolution of all three antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this situation is exacerbated in a spin tetrahedron .",
    "a three - dimensional network of vertex - sharing tetrahedra constitutes an extremely frustrated system when the nearest interactions are antiferromagnetic .",
    "such a lattice is known as a pyrochlore lattice . as",
    "pylochlore - lattice magnets have a vast number of microscopic states of very similar energies , the magnetic phase is very sensitive to subtle perturbations that can be otherwise ignored in non - frustrated systems .",
    "antiferromagnetic pyrochlore - lattice magnets , such as zncr@xmath4o@xmath0 , cdcr@xmath4o@xmath0 and hgcr@xmath4o@xmath0 , display both lattice distortion and long - range magnetic ordering.@xcite in this kind of materials , the true ground state of the undistorted pyrochlore lattice is usually hidden by the effect of lattice distortion , which relieves the high frustration and imparts a long - range ordered state . on the other hand ,",
    "the pyrochlore antiferromagnet y@xmath4mo@xmath4o@xmath5 has been shown to undergo a transition to a spin - glass state@xcite in which spins are frozen without the formation of long - range order .",
    "the spin glass can be well described within a classical mechanical framework and the true ground state is still hidden .",
    "theoretically , the precise ground state of pyrochlore lattices with quantum ( @xmath6 ) spin , however , remains controversial , with some theories predicting a spin - liquid state and others predicting spin - singlet ordering.@xcite the concept of a spin liquid has been proposed for a triangular lattice of @xmath6 spins , in which all spins form singlet pairs but the combination of pairs fluctuates.@xcite however , it has been pointed out that the pyrochlore lattice contains not only dimer singlets , but also other types of singlet states , which have been referred to as plaquette singlets.@xcite the coexistence of different types of singlet states is expected to have an important effect on the ground state of pyrochlore magnets .",
    "apart from such infinite systems , direct experimental evidence for a simpler system composed of almost isolated tetrahedra is expected to provide valuable information clarifying the relationship between highly symmetric structures and the quantum aspects of spins .",
    "the aim of the present study was to characterize the behavior of a perfect spin tetrahedron formed by four magnetic ions without lattice distortion .",
    "however , lattices comprised of perfect spin tetrahedra are exceedingly rare , as the spin tetrahedra in most model materials are distorted.@xcite recently , the present authors succeeded in synthesizing good single crystals of co@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite which is one of the ideal materials for studying a spin tetrahedron .",

    "the volume of a typical crystal is 1 - 10 mm@xmath9 , large enough for the measurements of magnetic and thermal measurement .",
    "we confirmed that each of the obtained crystals has the lattice constant of co@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2 , @xmath10   , reported by rowsell , _ _ et al.__@xcite using an imaging - plate type x - ray diffractmeter ( rigaku , r - axis rapid ) .",

    ", @xmath32 is negative .    in the classical regime , the total magnetic moment per cluster is completely cancelled under a zero field , while a finite non - zero moment is induced under a small magnetic field because the spins continuously change direction with respect to the magnetic field .",

    "the energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( 1 ) ) are easily obtained by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the quantum numbers corresponding to the magnitude of the total spin per cluster and of each spin , respectively , @xmath37 is the magnetic field , and @xmath38 is the spin component of the total spin along the magnetic field .",
    "the total spin ( @xmath35 ) is an integer from 0 to @xmath39 , and @xmath38 is an integer from @xmath40 to @xmath35 .",
    "this results in a staircase - like magnetization curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the step width and step height are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "such a magnetization curve qualitatively explains the undulating feature of the observed curve , although the observed relationship is considerably more smeared .    for further clarification of this relationship , and to clarify the origin of the double - peak structure of the specific heat relationship and the non - zero susceptibility at low temperature",
    ", the simple model can be extended to include the interactions originally omitted in eq .",
    "the hamiltonian for this expanded model is given by @xmath43 in this hamiltonian , the second term accounts for single - ion spin anisotropies , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) for easy - plane ( easy - axis ) anisotropy .",

    "when a finite @xmath51 is introduced , degenerate levels are split as a result of mixing between different @xmath35 states as shown in fig .",
    "this results in the non - zero susceptibility at low temperature and the smearing of the ideal staircase - like magnetization curve .",
    "a group - theoretical analysis reveals that the ground state is four - fold degenerate for @xmath60 , splitting into three energy levels ( the highest still doubly degenerate ) with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "this behavior gives rise to the double peak structure in the specific heat curve , where the peak at 1 k corresponds to the excitation between different types of singlet states .",
    "in co@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2 , the single - ion anisotropy ( @xmath51 ) lifts the degeneracy of the ground state , and may explain why the spin tetrahedra in this material are free from jahn - teller type distortion .",

    "the present results demonstrate that the coexistence of different types of singlet states is an important characteristic of spin tetrahedra . in the simplest @xmath6 spin tetrahedron ,",
    "the singlet states have two - fold degeneracy , assigned in one previous study to a dimer singlet and a plaquette singlet,@xcite and in another to two bases with opposite chirality.@xcite it is interesting to remember that such degenerate nature of spin tetrahedron may make the ground state of the pyrochlore magnet exotic .",
    "through investigation of the magnetic properties of undistorted spin tetrahedra in co@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2 , this compound was demonstrated to have an almost spinless ground state and a periodically undulating magnetization curve indicative of quantization of the total spin per spin tetrahedron .",
    "the specific heat exhibited two peaks at low temperature , which are interpreted as being due to a complex ground state composed of multiply degenerate singlet states reflecting the highly symmetric structure of the regular tetrahedron . in the present material , it would also be interesting to investigate magnetism under high pressure , which modifies the magnitude of the intercluster interactions and might cause a quantum phase transition to a long - range ordered state .",
