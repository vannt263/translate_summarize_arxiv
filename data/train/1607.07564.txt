    "<S> more accurate results are achieved with hse hybrid dft functional and g@xmath18w@xmath18 approximation , and the corrected gaps agree well with available experimental data . for ges , for example , theory indicates gaps between 1.53 - 1.81  ev , in close agreement with experimental values , in the range 1.70 - 1.96  ev for the conduction gap after extrapolation to @xmath19  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spread in experimental values for conduction and optical gaps makes an estimate of the exciton binding energy difficult to obtain , but place a higher bound at 0.3 ev .    </S>",

    "<S> the scenario changes in the gw - bse framework : two intense exciton peaks are present at 2.2 ev and 2.6 ev , below the indirect g@xmath8w@xmath8 gap of 2.85  ev . </S>",
    "<S> these two excitons are still originated from critical points but the e - h interactions induce different intensity , and have different binding energies . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , in the armchair case , the top valence- bottom conduction band transitions at @xmath22 and @xmath1 points are very attenuated by the dipole coupling term ( as displayed at gw - rpa level ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gw - bse absorption spectrum calculations shows strong excitonic effects that lead single - particle transitions with energies higher than the band gap to the continuum of bottom of conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> excitons living in the band gap are almost suppressed .    in gese monolayer , absorption spectrum calculations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ abs_gese ] ) provide different outcomes . as far as armchair direction </S>",

    "<S> the excitonic effects determine a general red shift of the one particle excited states with an increase in intensity of the continuum of the transitions .    in order to better understand the nature of the first peak excitons in armchair directions in ges and gese monolayer , the normalized squared electron - hole wavefunctions @xmath30 have been shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> when dealing with 2d materials , one must exercise caution as the coulomb term is replaced by the keldysh - like potential due to the in - plane screening . </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath31 felt by an electron in a 2d dielectric was obtained in ref .   for a 2d sheet in vaccum and extended in ref .   </S>",

    "<S> it is determined that , at large @xmath38 , the @xmath31 interaction follows the usual @xmath39 form , while at small distances it diverges logarithmically .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since the logarithmic well is more gradual than @xmath39 , this results in substantially smaller binding energies .    </S>",
    "<S> once the correct potential is chosen , it is important to keep in mind that the reduction of the two - body exciton problem to a single - body central potential problem is only applicable to mott - wannier excitons where the wave function is much larger than the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the reason behind this requirement is the fact that the potential ( [ phi2d ] ) treats the system as a continuous medium . with these considerations , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to determine exciton binding energies of 2d anisotropic materials , with and without substrate effects , as detailed in ref .  .    the dependence of the exciton binding energies on the substrate dielectric constant @xmath40 , for single - layer ges and gese , are presented in the plot in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> screening effects introduced by the substrate decrease the binding energies with increasing @xmath40 . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , a reasonable choice is to consider the layers deposited on sio@xmath2 substrate ( @xmath41  2.4 ) . in this case , the exciton binding energies are reduced to 0.60 and 0.22  ev for ges and gese , placing phosphorene in the middle - way of these two materials , with an exciton binding energy of 0.4  ev for the same substrate  @xcite .    = ( 1+@xmath36)/2 . ]    </S>",
