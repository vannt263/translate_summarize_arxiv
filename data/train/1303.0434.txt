    "secondary data for solar particle flux and energy in space was collected .",
    "this data was primarily collected by a satellite geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes -11 ) , and prepared by the u.s .",
    "department of commerce , noaa , space weather prediction center .",
    "goes 11 is an american weather satellite , which is part of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration s geostationary operational environmental satellite system .",
    "it was launched in 2000 , and as at 2009 it was operating at the goes - west position , providing coverage of the west of the united states .",
    "the data consist of proton flux ( @xmath0 ) and electron flux ( @xmath1 ) in geo , taken at five minutes interval on daily basis for the period of three months ( april june , 2010 ) .",
    "the label used for particles flux has the following interpretation : @xmath2 = particles at @xmath3 , @xmath4 = particles at @xmath5 , @xmath6 = particles at @xmath7 , @xmath8 = particles at @xmath9 , @xmath10 = particles at @xmath11 , @xmath12 = particles at @xmath13 , @xmath14 = electrons at @xmath15 , @xmath16 = electrons at @xmath17 .",
    "units : particles = @xmath18 , electrons = @xmath19      the mean flux per day was determined for each month ; they were compared by means of graphs and logical interpretations .",
    "the composite materials of spacecraft and its electronic components were considered for assessment and analysis ( germanium , silicon , aluminum and aluminum alloy ) .",
    "the constituent elements of the aluminum alloy considered and their composition ( by weight ) are presented in table 1 .",
    "the mass stopping power of the materials for the particle ( with e=1 - 100mev ) was calculated as well as the range and distance traveled by the particle as it traverses the materials .",
    "the dose as a function of particle s flux and energy was also calculated .",
    "consequently , predictions of possible effects ( of solar particles ) on space system operations and life - span were made , particularly as values exceeded certain threshold or limit .",
    "a more fundamental way of describing the rate of energy loss is to specify the rate in terms of the density thickness ; this is called the mass stopping power and has the unit @xmath20 .",
    "the empirical relation below was adopted [ 5 ] .",
    "@xmath21    the appropriate values of the constants and are a=915 , b=0.85 , c=0.145 , d=0.635 + the combined mass stopping power of the aluminum - silicon alloy material in this work was calculated from the expression below :",
    "@xmath22    the dose ( in gy ) as a function of the particle flux is also important , particularly as the spacecraft spends more time in the space radiation environment .",
    "the stopping power is used to determine dose from charged particle by the relationship :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the particle fluence ( the number of particle striking the material over a specified time interval ) , its unit is @xmath25 .",
    "d is measured in mev / g . converting this to units of dose in the relation we get ;    @xmath26    where 1gy = 100rad    the range , r of a proton with initial kinetic energy @xmath27 , mass m , is mean distance it traveled before it stops .",
    "the range depends upon the type of the particle , its initial energy and the material it traverses .",
    "it is expressed in the unit of @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "we adopted the empirical relation [ 5 ] below ;    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    the range is related to the distance , x traveled by the particle ( in cm ) by the equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the density of the material through which the particle traverses .",
    "the equations adopted for calculations in this work , particularly the mass stopping power ( 1 ) was originally obtained and used for calculation of mass stopping power of low energy region . by way of comparison calculations made using bethe s equation",
    "showed that at higher energies ( @xmath35 ) the difference between equation ( 1 ) and bethe s equation becomes significant .",
    "satellite and space probes typically encounter total ionizing dose between 10 ( 100gy ) and 100 krad ( si ) ( 1000gy ) . a spacecraft made of al alloy ( 20 mm thick ) , housing sensitive eeec in the absence of mitigation of any kind becomes susceptible when particles with @xmath36 bombards it .",
    "greater percentage of this energy is lost during the process due to the stopping power of the alloy ; however the remainder constitutes a significant dose to the eeec components .",
    "the cumulative equivalent dose from this energy spectrum is about 259 rad(si ) in silicon and 120 rad(ge ) in germanium .",
    "the net effect is that deposited dose builds up with time as exposure continues until the threshold is exceeded and consequently failure occurs due to total ionizing dose ( tid ) . to predict the mean time of failure , the time to failure t ( in years )",
    "is given by the suggested equation :    @xmath37",
    "using the empirical relations in equations 1 , 3 and 4 , the mass stopping power and particle s range and distance in aluminum , aluminum alloy , germanium and silicon were calculated for proton energy of e=1 - 100mev .",
    "the results are presented in tables 2 - 5 . the dose deposited by particles as it traverses through the materials ( ge , si )",
    "was also calculated from equation 2 and presented in tables 6 and 7 .",
    "the mean particles ( electron and proton ) fluxes per day were determined for each month ; they were compared by means of graphs and logical interpretations .",
    "aluminum alloy material gave increased stopping power compared to pure aluminum .",
    "this implies that al alloy may be a better shield from particles than pure al ( see figure 3 and table 2 ) .",
    "as could be seen ge is more prone to particle penetration than si .",
    "though dose deposited by the particle at same energy is much less in ge compared to si , ge receives twice as si ( figure 3 and table 2 ) . between 2nd and 11th day",
    ", electron flux tend to increase with the peak occurring in april ( figure 4 ) .",
    "there is a possibility of the spacecraft being in eclipse / shadow between 2nd and 11th .",
    "the satellite / spacecraft ( in geo ) may have experienced negative charging and consequently assume a negative potential .",
    "proton flux ( @xmath38 ) climaxed in june between 10  13th ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "in addition to trapped radiation in the geostationary orbit a solar particle event ( such as cmes , solar flares ) may have occurred leading to an increase in particle flux .",
    "this implies increased dose to spacecraft components in the event of particles access to the components .",
    "in addition , the probability of single - event effects occurrence in eeec is most likely .",
    "aluminum alloy should be used in building the body of spacecrafts . where the recommendation for the use of aluminum has been implemented , increase in percentage composition of constituent elements with high stopping power ( such as mg and si ) should also be considered . however , this should be carefully done so as to avert inherent problem resulting from properties of individual constituent elements such as expansion and contraction during temperature rise / fall , and associated weight of the craft .",
    "a multi - layer surface coating should be considered in addition to using materials with high stopping power such as magnesium , silicon , carbon and beryllium .",
    "aluminum alloy may better shield the spacecraft and its eeec against particle than pure aluminum because it high stopping power .",
    "electron flux was at peak between 2nd and 11th of april 2010 considering the three months data .",
    "this could result to a negative potential build up on spacecraft surface ( depending on it position ) , of which upon emergence into sunlight could experience a possible discharge effects which can disrupt satellite operations .",
    "proton flux peaked between 10th and 13th of june , an indication that a solar particle event may have occurred .",
    "this exposes the space system to high dose rate and susceptibility to single event effects . under these space radiation environmental conditions , in the geosynchronous orbit and in the absence of mitigation of any kind a spacecraft whose body is made of al alloy and 20 mm thick , housing sensitive eeec will theoretically experience minimum failure - time threshold after 3 years ( 10 krad ) and continue to be at risk until 29th year when dose build - up equals 100krad ( due to total ionizing dose ) , during which it will experience a catastrophic failure .",
