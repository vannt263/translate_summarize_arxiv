    "it was recognized a while ago  @xcite that the simplest model to reconcile the existence of a hot dark matter ( hdm ) component in the universe @xcite and possibly incorporating an explanation of the lsnd results @xcite with the solar @xcite and atmospheric neutrino data @xcite is to invoke a fourth sterile ( electroweak singlet ) neutrino at the ev scale .",
    "recently there have been many papers on this scheme and its variants as well as phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the effects of active to sterile neutrino transitions induced by the mixing on supernova physics have been studied in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "here we also consider the relevance of such active to sterile neutrino conversion @xmath8 ( @xmath2 denote sterile neutrino ) but induced by a nonzero transition magnetic moment ( tmm ) , similar to the transition magnetic moment between two active neutrino flavours  @xcite . such tmm leads to a neutrino spin - flavour precession ( sfp ) effect similar to the active - active case  @xcite . the same way as the sfp effect may take place resonantly in the presence of matter @xcite , like msw effect @xcite , so does the active - sterile sfp .",
    "here we adopt the general case where and are two independent majorana particles .",
    "however , the sterile state can be a right - handed component of a dirac neutrino . in this case , @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) should be regarded as a particle carrying lepton number @xmath10 ( 1 ) in our notation .",
    "although expected to be small , e.g. if the neutrino mass is introduced _ a la dirac _ in the same way as the charged fermion masses in the standard electroweak theory the resulting neutrino magnetic moment is known to be very small @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino mass and @xmath13 denotes the bohr magneton .",
    "however , several attempts have been made to construct various mechanisms to induce a large neutrino magnetic moment of order @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in fact this is a natural possibility in the context of radiative models of neutrino mass , such as that of the sterile neutrino models of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us first recall here the previous bounds on the neutrino magnetic moments from laboratory experiments as well as from astrophysical considerations .",
    "starting with laboratory limits , the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moments comes from the @xmath15 scattering experiments which give @xcite , @xmath16 this bound applies to the direct or transition magnetic moment of dirac neutrinos , as well as to the transition magnetic moment of majorana neutrinos .    from the sn1987a",
    "neutrino observations the bounds on dipole magnetic moment of dirac neutrinos has been derived by considering the helicity - flipping scattering processes such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 inside the supernova core @xcite . by requiring that the @xmath19 luminosity should be not too large in order to account for the observed neutrino data from sn1987a in kamiokande ii @xcite and imb @xcite detectors , the constraint @xmath20 is obtained .",
    "similar upper bound has been obtained also in a recent paper @xcite by considering neutrino helicity flipping process through photon landau damping in a dense relativistic plasma in a supernova core .",
    "it has also been discussed @xcite that this bound could be improved to @xmath21 by taking into account the absence of higher energy neutrino events which would be expected due to the spin rotation of higher energy @xmath19 produced in the core to @xmath22 in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "let us note that these discussion also applies to the transition magnetic moment of dirac neutrinos as well as to the ones which connects active and sterile majorana neutrinos if one can neglect the mass squared difference @xmath23 in the process discussed above .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that @xcite these bounds could be invalid if the resonant re - conversion of neutrinos take place in the supernova .",
    "one could also obtain limits from the arguments of excessive cooling of red giant stars due to the neutrino emission induced by the neutrino magnetic moment . ref .",
    "@xcite gives the bound , @xmath24 which also applies both to dirac magnetic moments , as well as for majorana transition moments .    in this paper",
    "we show that a non - zero - transition magnetic moment ( tmm ) would have an important effects in the presence of the strong magnetic fields @xmath25 gauss during a sn explosion since there can be a resonant spin - flavour precession ( rsfp ) between the active and the sterile neutrino flavour , similar to what occurs for the active - active case .",
    "the latter has been extensively considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we show how - resonant conversions induced by the active - sterile tmm enhance the @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis in all of the mass range relevant for the neutrino hot dark matter scenario @xcite . on the other hand",
    "we estimate the restrictions on neutrino active - sterile tmm from sn1987a data , and investigate the influence of these - tmm - induced conversions in the shock revival problem . for previous related work",
    "see refs .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite has considered - tmm - induced rsfp in the context of sn physics for the case of random magnetic fields , in which case the conversion occurs in a non - periodic regime . here",
    "we are considering the case of regular fields , and we discuss novel issues related to sn physics which were not considered in @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath26 so that the neutrino helicity flipping process in the core @xcite , discussed above can be neglected ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "iv for the case if @xmath27 ) . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the picture of the neutrino propagation in matter and the resonant @xmath28 conversion @xcite . sec .",
    "iii.a discusses the implications of @xmath28 conversions for the neutrino re - heating mechanism . in sec .",
    "iii.b we analyse the impact of our scenario in the later epoch of supernova evolution ( few seconds after the core bounce ) for sn ( anti- ) neutrino detection rates ( sec .",
    "iii.b ) , as well as for @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis ( sec .",
    "iii.c ) . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our results .",
    "in our discussion we only consider the @xmath8 and @xmath29 conversion channels , where ( @xmath9 ) is a sterile neutrino , due to resonant spin precession . for simplicity we neglect in what follows the mixing between and so that the @xmath30 evolution hamiltonian for the neutrino system @xcite reduces to an effective @xmath31 system .",
    "moreover we consider the @xmath32 case , i.e. , sterile state is heavier .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath28 system in the matter background with non - zero magnetic field is determined by the following schredinger - like equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neutrino magnetic moment and @xmath35 is the magnetic field strength perpendicular to the neutrino trajectory .",
    "the effective potential @xmath36 for @xmath37 arises from the coherent forward neutrino scattering off - matter constituents @xcite and is given by , @xmath38 note that there is no potential for @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the fermi constant , @xmath41 is the matter density , @xmath42 is the nucleon mass and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the net electron and the neutron number densities in matter , respectively . note that charge neutrality @xmath45 is assumed . for the @xmath29 system the matter potential just change its sign .",
    "the resonance condition is : @xmath46 let us note that for @xmath47 , either @xmath8 ( for @xmath48 i.e. @xmath49 ) or @xmath29 ( for @xmath50 i.e. @xmath51 ) conversions take place .",
    "this is important because , as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the region above the neutrinosphere the matter potential @xmath36 changes its sign due to the different chemical content .    -0.5",
    "cm    -0.5 cm    -0.8 cm    in figs . 1 ( earlier epoch ) and 2 ( later epoch ) we reproduce the typical profiles of corresponding @xmath52 in the region of interest , taken from ref .",
    "they are obtained from the @xmath53 and @xmath41 profiles taken from wilson s supernova model outside the neutrinosphere , at two different times , @xmath54 s and @xmath55 s post - bounce .",
    "there is a point where @xmath53 takes the value @xmath56 ( i.e. @xmath57 ) , as indicated by @xmath58 .",
    "this position corresponds to @xmath59 km and 12 km for the earlier and later epochs , respectively .",
    "clearly , the effective potential @xmath36 changes its sign from negative to positive at the point @xmath58 .",
    "the resonance condition in provides the @xmath23 value for which neutrinos with some given energy can experience the resonance for a certain value of the potential ( or equivalently , at some position @xmath4 ) . for convenience , in the right ordinate of the figs . 1 and 2 we have also indicated the corresponding @xmath23 values for which neutrinos under go resonance , for typical neutrino energy @xmath60 mev .",
    "we see that for @xmath61 ev@xmath62 only @xmath63 conversions can occur , and this happens in the region where @xmath64 . on the other hand for @xmath65 ev@xmath62 three resonances may occur .",
    "the @xmath3 s are first converted , say at @xmath66 , then there are two resonance points at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 ( i.e. in the region where @xmath70 ) , for the @xmath8 channel .",
    "a schematic level crossing diagram for @xmath71 and @xmath1 system may be seen explicitly in fig .",
    "note that the @xmath2 s originated from the first @xmath37 conversion ( at @xmath72 ) can be re - converted into @xmath37 s at the second resonance ( at @xmath68 ) .    in what follows",
    "we will employ the simple landau - zener approximation @xcite in order to estimate the survival probability after the neutrinos cross the resonance . under this approximation ,",
    "the @xmath37 ( or @xmath3 ) survival probability is given by , @xmath73 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the neutrino oscillation length at resonance .",
    "notice that for @xmath75 the resonant neutrino conversion will be adiabatic @xcite .    as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , depending on the @xmath76 values , the @xmath0 system may encounter two resonances . in order to take this into account",
    "we compute the @xmath37 survival probability after the second resonance as follows , @xmath77 [ 1-p(r_3)],\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the survival probabilities calculated according to the at the first and second resonance positions @xmath72 and @xmath68 , respectively .    in this work",
    "we will neglect the spin precession due to the galactic magnetic field discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since for the relevant parameters of interest to us here the condition @xmath80 , where @xmath81 g is the galactic magnetic field , is always satisfied so that the spin precession in the galactic field is strongly suppressed .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we now consider the possible impact of active - sterile neutrino conversions on different aspects of supernova astrophysics . we analyse processes taking place at the early epochs as well as at the cooling stage , in order to get a feeling for their sensitivity to the underlying neutrino mass - square difference , magnetic moments and magnetic fields . in the following we consider only epochs after the core bounce and the neutrino evolution in regions outside the neutrino - spheres , where resonant conversions take place .      here",
    "we are considering the earlier epoch @xmath54 second after core bounce . in the delayed explosion scenario @xcite the neutrino energy deposition , occurring between the neutrino sphere and the site where",
    "the shock is stalled ( about 500 km or so from the core ) can re - start the shock and power the explosion .",
    "the disappearance of either @xmath37 or @xmath82 due to the resonant spin precession into sterile states would reduce the energy deposition rate .",
    "the neutrino energy deposition rate @xmath83 at the stalled shock is defined as follows , @xmath84 where the primed quantities @xmath85 and @xmath86 stand for the proton and neutron abundances calculated in the presence of active - sterile neutrino conversions .",
    "the un - primed ones correspond to the case where no conversion occurs . as an approximation ,",
    "we have assumed , in that the neutrino energy spectra @xmath87 are fermi - dirac with zero chemical potential but with different characteristic temperatures @xmath88 which depend on the neutrino flavour . as in our previous analysis @xcite we choose @xmath88 for @xmath37 and @xmath82 such that the typically predicted average energies , @xmath89 mev and @xmath90 mev are obtained in the absence of any conversion .",
    "we assume a magnetic field profile @xmath91 where @xmath92 g , @xmath93 , @xmath94 km and @xmath4 is the distance from the center of the star .",
    "we have also studied the case where @xmath95 and obtained the similar results .    in",
    "we plot the iso - contour of @xmath83 in terms of ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "we show the values of @xmath97 in units of @xmath98 gauss , where @xmath99 g ( at @xmath100 km ) might be the maximally conceivable value @xcite .",
    "this is taken as a reference value in order to illustrate the maximal sensitivity to the neutrino magnetic moment ( though such a value of magnetic field may affect the supernova dynamics and self - consistent calculations would be required for its justification @xcite ) .",
    "thus we can say that if the neutrino re - heating is essential for successful supernova explosion the parameter region right to the curve , say @xmath101 , is disfavoured .",
    "we are now in the later epoch @xmath102 second after core bounce , in the so - called kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase .",
    "the observed @xmath3 events from the supernova sn1987a in kamiokande ii @xcite and imb @xcite detectors , 11 and 8 events , respectively , are in good agreement with the theoretical expectations .",
    "therefore , any significant conversion of @xmath3 s into a sterile neutrino species would be in conflict with this evidence .",
    "we consider the effect of active - sterile neutrino conversions both on the @xmath3 signal in order to analyse the possible restrictions on neutrino parameters , the neutrino magnetic moment and the mass - squared difference .",
    "we plot in three contours of the @xmath3 survival probability @xmath103 , which is averaged over the fermi - dirac energy distribution , for the @xmath104 conversion , in the ( @xmath96 ) plane . in the plot",
    "the left , the middle and the right lines correspond to @xmath103=0.9 , 0.5 and 0.1 , respectively . if we assume that the successful observation of the sn1987a signal implies that at least 50 % of the expected @xmath3 signal has been detected",
    ", one can conclude that all the portion right to the curve @xmath105 is ruled out .",
    "we note that due to the fact that the potential is much steeper in the later epoch than in the earlier epoch , the bound we obtained in fig .",
    "4 is much weaker than the sensitivity we have displayed in fig .",
    "3 .      here",
    ", we consider the implications of resonant neutrino conversions for the supernova nucleosynthesis of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the supernova could be the most promising site for heavy elements ( mass number @xmath106 ) nucleosynthesis , the so - called @xmath4-process @xcite , in which neutrinos play very important rle @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition required for the @xmath4-process is @xmath107 in the nucleosynthesis region .",
    "the @xmath53 value in the @xmath4-process site is mainly determined by the following neutrino absorption reactions , @xmath108 therefore , in the nucleosynthesis region we can write @xmath53 as follows @xcite , @xmath109 from this expression , we notice that the @xmath110 conversion leads to an increase of @xmath53 , whereas the @xmath111 conversion acts in the opposite way . as we described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , depending on the @xmath23 range , one channel dominates over the other one , and @xmath53 can be increased or decreased .",
    "using again the fermi - dirac energy distribution to average the neutrino absorption rates , we have calculated the electron abundance @xmath53 at the site where heavy elements nucleosynthesis is expected to take place as functions of @xmath112 .",
    "we present our result in fig .",
    "5 . for a successful @xmath4-process ,",
    "the region above @xmath113 is ruled out . on the other hand",
    "we find that the supernova nucleosynthesis could be enhanced in the region enclosed by the contour @xmath114 , similar to the results obtained in ref .",
    "this region is delimited by @xmath115 ev@xmath62 and @xmath116 in units of @xmath13 for @xmath92 g. inside the contour of @xmath117 , @xmath53 might get stabilised to @xmath118 1/3 due to some feedback effect which we discussed in detail in ref .",
    "we see from the plot that the most promising mass range for the neutrino hot dark matter scenario @xcite , @xmath119 ev@xmath62 , lies inside that where the @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis is enhanced .",
    "moreover , it is neither in conflict with the re - heating process ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , for @xmath120 g ) , nor with sn1987a observations ( see fig .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effect on supernova physics of having rsfp conversions induced by non - zero active - sterile tmm . we have investigated the sensitivity of the shock revival and @xmath4-process arguments , as well as estimated the restrictions from the observed sn1987a @xmath82 detection rates .",
    "we have analysed the effect of rsfp conversions involving to or to in the region above the hot proto - neutron star in type ii supernovae , assuming the simple magnetic field profile , @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 is taken to be 100 and 10 km for earlier and later epoch , respectively . if the mass of the is in the cosmologically interesting range and the product of the tmm by the magnetic field just above the neutrinosphere , @xmath97 , is larger than @xmath124 g )",
    ", then a significant fraction of @xmath37 and @xmath82 would be converted into @xmath2 and @xmath9 , respectively , in the region outside neutrinosphere .",
    "such conversion could lead to the depletion of @xmath37 and @xmath82 fluxes , resulting in a suppression of the expected @xmath82 signal in underground terrestrial detectors , in contradiction with the successful observation of the sn1987a @xmath82 signal in the imb and kamiokande detectors .",
    "hence , on this basis we can constrain the neutrino mass and neutrino magnetic moment by requiring that the total @xmath82 flux during the thermal neutrino emission epoch should not be significantly depleted by @xmath29 conversion , and can rule out the range @xmath125 g ) .",
    "the tmm - induced - rsfp would also suppress the neutrino re - heating behind the stalled shock .",
    "we have found that for @xmath126 g ) , the energy deposition by @xmath127 and @xmath82 absorption reactions during the shock re - heating epoch ( @xmath128 s after the bounce ) could be significantly decreased . from the @xmath4-process argument , for the parameter range @xmath129 , where the @xmath130 conversion is dominant , @xmath53 at the nucleosynthesis site could become larger than 0.5 and hence @xmath4-process would be forbidden , leading to a disfavoured range , @xmath131 g ) . on the other hand , for @xmath132 , @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis could be enhanced due to the decrease of @xmath53 down to the minimum value 1/3 due to the efficient @xmath111 conversion if the parameters are in the region @xmath133 g ) .    throughout the above discussion we have neglected , for simplicity , the production of the sterile state due to the neutrino helicity - flipping processes in the core , which was discussed in refs",
    "this requires @xmath20 .",
    "let us finally discuss briefly the case @xmath34 is larger than @xmath134 ( but smaller than the laboratory limit ( 1 ) ) . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in this case the sterile states can be copiously produced by the helicity - flipping scattering processes in the sn core and they can escape freely to the outer region with higher energy . for the earlier epoch ,",
    "relevant for shock reheating , if the parameters ( @xmath96 ) are in the region where the rsfp is efficient , the reheating rate would be increased  @xcite due to the re - conversion of @xmath135 and/or @xmath136 since the @xmath37 and @xmath82 would have higher energy compared to the standard case .",
    "therefore , we would not get any disfavoured region but a positive effect from this conversion .",
    "however , for the discussion on the @xmath82 signal we still would get constraints due to a different reason @xcite . in this case",
    "we would not have the reduction of the @xmath82 signal but instead we would get an increase in the expected number of events at underground detectors .",
    "this enhanced @xmath82 signal would follow from the increase in the average energy due to the @xmath137 re - conversion .",
    "this would allow us to disfavour a similar range of parameters as in fig .",
    "4 . finally from the @xmath4-process argument",
    ", we would have a different conclusion from what we obtained in sec .",
    "iii c. roughly speaking , the allowed region ( @xmath138 ) in fig .",
    "5 would now become disfavoured region whereas the disfavoured region ( @xmath113 ) in the same plot would now become the allowed one .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "for example , if the parameters are in the region where @xmath139 in fig .",
    "5 , only the resonant conversion at @xmath68 ( defined in sec .",
    "ii ) is adiabatic due to the fast variation at @xmath72 but the slower variation of the potential at @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in the anti - neutrino case ,",
    "the @xmath140 conversion at @xmath141 can be neglected , as one can see from fig .",
    "4 , for magnetic moments smaller than @xmath142 @xmath13 or so .",
    "this implies that , instead of the net effect of the @xmath8 conversion expected in the case we considered in sec .",
    "iii.c , now we expect efficient @xmath136 conversion , which makes the average energy of the resulting @xmath37 higher than in the no - conversion case .",
    "this has the result of driving the @xmath53 value larger than 0.5 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ye_new ] ) ) . on the other hand one can expect the opposite behaviour for the region where",
    "@xmath113 ( and larger magnetic moment ) the conversions at all the points @xmath143 are expected to be adiabatic and therefore important .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , the net effect is the reduction of @xmath37 flux , when neutrinos reach the position where the r - process is occurring .",
    "the net effect is that the @xmath37 flux is decreased and the @xmath82 is increased . this way we expect that the value of @xmath53 will become smaller than in the no - conversion case .",
    "thus ( assuming that @xmath2 and @xmath9 are copiously produced in the core ) the region with @xmath113 would now become allowed by the r - process criterion .",
