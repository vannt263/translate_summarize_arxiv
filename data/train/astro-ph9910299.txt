    "information obtained from estimating the x - ray properties of quasars as a function of x - ray luminosity and redshift may be useful in constraining physical accretion disk models that explain the observed agn continuum emission .",

    "the gravitational lensing ( gl ) effect has been widely employed as an analysis tool in a variety of astrophysical situations .",
    "the study of gl systems ( gls ) in the radio and optical community has proven to be extremely rewarding by providing constraints on cosmological parameters @xmath2 and h@xmath1 ( kochanek 1996 , falco et al .",
    "1997 ) , by probing the evolution of mass - to - light ratios of high redshift galaxies ( keeton et al .",
    "1998 ) , by probing the evolution of the interstellar medium of distant galaxies ( nadeau et al . 1991 ) , and by determining the total mass , spatial extent and ionization conditions of intervening absorption systems .",
    "the study of gl quasars in the x - ray band has been limited until now , the main limiting factor being the collecting area and spectral resolution of current x - ray telescopes combined with the small angular separations of lensed quasar images .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to make use of the magnification effect of gl systems to investigate the x - ray properties of faint radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .    in many cases the available x - ray spectra of distant quasars",
    "have relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "this has lead to the development of various techniques to aid the study of faint quasars with 0.2 - 2 kev x - ray fluxes below 1 @xmath3 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "most of these observational and analysis techniques employed to date to study the evolution and spectral emission mechanism of faint quasars are in general a slight variation of two distinct approaches . on the one end",
    "we find techniques that are based on summing the individual spectra of many faint x - ray sources taken from a large and complete sample ( see for example schartel et al .",
    "1996 ; vikhlinin et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the goal of stacking is to obtain a single , high signal - to - noise ratio spectrum that contains enough counts to allow spectral fitting with quasar emission models . in some cases , where the initial sample is large enough",
    ", the spectra can be summed into bins of x - ray flux , redshift and radio luminosity class .",
    "schartel et al .",
    "1996 applied the stacking technique to a complete quasar sample and found that the mean spectral index for the stacked radio - quiet quasar spectrum was significantly ( @xmath7 ) steeper than that of the stacked radio - loud quasar spectrum .",
    "several of the assumptions made in this analysis which were related to the general properties of the quasars may , however , strongly influence the further interpretation of the results .",
    "it was assumed , for example , that quasar spectra follow single power - laws over rest frame energies ranging between ( 1+z)@xmath8 and ( 1+z)@xmath9 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the minimum and maximum energy bounds , respectively , of the bandpass of the x - ray observatory and z is the redshift of the quasar .",
    "analyzed in the observer s frame , quasar spectra with concave spectral slopes of increasing redshift would appear to be flatter as a consequence of the cosmological redshift .",
    "any implications of evolutionary change within the quasar spectrum derived from the analysis of stacked spectra in observed frames would need to include the effect of cosmological redshift .",
    "detailed spectra of quasars however indicate in general the presence of several components each associated to a different physical process .",
    "for example , several known processes contributing to the observed x - ray spectra are compton reflection of photons in the disk coronae by the disk which becomes significant at rest energies above @xmath10 10kev , inverse compton scattering of photons in the disk coronae by uv photons originating from the disk resulting in a boost of photon energies from the uv range into the soft x - ray range ( this is the mechanism that produces the observed power - law spectrum in the 2 - 10kev range ) , accretion disk emission , absorption by highly ionized gas ( warm absorbers ) , beamed x - ray emission from jets which may be a large contributor for distant radio - loud quasars , absorption by accretion disk winds , and intervening absorption by damped lyman alpha systems .",
    "the stacked spectrum therefore contains contributions from quasars of different redshifts and possibly spectral shapes that make the interpretation of the results difficult .",
    "vikhlinin et al .",
    "1995 , using the rosat emss sample of 2678 sources , produced stacked spectra within several flux bins .",
    "they find a significant continuous flattening of the fitted spectral slopes from higher towards lower x - ray fluxes .",
    "one interesting result of their study is that the spectral slope at the very faint end is approximately equal to the slope of the hard ( 2 - 10kev ) x - ray background .",
    "the unknown nature of many of the point sources included in the vikhlinin sample , the inclusion of sources with different redshifts and the calculation of observed rest spectral indices complicates the interpretation of the results .    a second technique used to study the general properties of quasars is based on obtaining deep x - ray observations of a few quasars .",
    "one advantage of such an approach is that the properties of individual quasars are not smeared out as with stacking methods .",
    "the faint fluxes however require extremely long observing times to achieve useable s / n . when total counts are low the quasar x - ray spectra are commonly characterized by a hardness ratio defined as r = ( h - s)/(h + s ) , where h and s are the number of counts within some defined hard and soft energy band in the observer s frame respectively .    in this paper",
    "we outline an alternative approach to investigating the emission mechanism of radio - loud and quiet quasars at high redshift .",
    "the gravitational lensing magnification of distant quasars allows us to investigate the x - ray properties of quasars with luminosities relatively lower than those of unlensed quasars of similar redshifts .",
    "the amplification factors produced by lensing depends on the geometry of the lensing system and for our sample range between 2 and 30 . the moderate - s / n spectra of our sample allow us to employ spectral models with multiple power - law slopes and perform fits in rest - frame energy bands .",
    "our analysis makes use of the gl amplification effect to extend the study of quasar properties to unlensed x - ray flux levels as low as a few @xmath3 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 . the limiting sensitivity of the rosat all - sky survey , for example , on which many recent studies are based is a few @xmath3 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 .    for a gl system with a lens that can be modeled well with a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model",
    "the amplification is straightforward to derive analytically . in most observed cases , however , the deflector is a galaxy or cluster of galaxies with a gravitational potential that does not follow the sis model and more sophisticated potential models need to be invoked to successfully model these gl systems . to estimate the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of gl quasars in our sample we have incorporated magnification factors determined from modeling of the gl systems with a variety of lens potentials",
    "we performed fits of spectral models to the x - ray data in three rest energy bins , soft from 0.5 - 1 kev , mid from 1 - 4 kev , and high from 4 - 20 kev .",
    "working in the quasar rest frame as opposed to the observers rest frame allows us to distinguish between true spectral evolution of quasars with redshift and apparent change in quasar spectra due to the cosmological redshift of quasar spectra through a fixed energy window in the observer s rest frame .    our search of the rosat and asca archives yielded 16 gl systems detected in x - rays out of a total of approximately 40 gl candidates .",
    "six of the gl quasars have observed x - ray spectra of medium - s / n .",
    "our search for x - ray counterparts to known gl quasars resulted in the identification of the relatively x - ray bright radio - quiet quasar sbs0909 + 532 with an estimated 0.2 - 2 kev flux of about 7 @xmath3 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "another interesting result of our search was the identification of a relatively large fraction of radio - quiet gl quasars with bal quasars .",
    "in particular we find that at least 35% of the known radio - quiet gl quasars are bal quasars .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the @xmath10 10% value presently quoted from optical surveys .    in section 2",
    "we present details of x - ray observations of gl quasars and describe the analysis techniques used to extract and fit the x - ray spectra .",
    "estimates of the flux magnification factors and unlensed luminosities for the gl systems studied in this paper are presented in section 3 .",
    "a description of the properties of each gl quasar is presented in section 4 . included in this section",
    "are results from spectral modeling of several x - ray observations of the variable gl bal quasar pg1115 + 080 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize the spectral properties of faint quasars as implied by spectral fits to a sample of gl quasar spectra and provide a plausible explanation for the apparently large fraction of gl bal quasars that we observe .",
    "the x - ray observations presented here were performed with the rosat and asca observatories .",
    "results for the spectral analyses in the x - ray band for the gl quasars q0957 + 561 , he1104 - 1805 , pks1830 - 211 and q1413 + 117 have already been published ( chartas et al . 1995 , 1998 ; reimers et al . 1995 ; mathur et al . 1997 ; green & mathur , 1996 ) while results from x - ray spectral analyses for the quasars sbs0909 + 532 , b1422 + 231 , pg1115 + 080 , 1208 + 1011 and qj0240 - 343 are presented here for the first time . we have included in table 1 several additional gl systems observed in the x - ray band .",
    "these observations however yielded either very low - s / n detections or were made with the rosat hri which provides very limited spectral information .",
    "x - ray spectra of the gl quasars q0957 + 561 , 1422 + 231 , he1104 - 1805 , sbs0909 + 532 and pg1115 + 080 with best fit models are presented in figure 1 through figure 5 respectively .",
    "the wide separation quasar pairs mg 0023 + 171 , q1120 + 0195 , lbqs 1429 - 008 and qj0240 - 343 are considered problematic gl candidates that may be binary quasars and not gravitational lenses ( kochanek et al .",
    "however , recent stis spectroscopy of q1120 + 0195(um425 ) has revealed broad absorption line features in both lensed images thus confirming the lens nature of this wide separation system ( smette et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the origin of the detected x - ray emission for the gl systems rxj0921 + 4528 and rxj0911.4 + 0551 can not be determined from the presently available poor s / n asca gis and rosat hri observations respectively .",
    "the most likely origins are either the lensed quasar and/or a possible lensing cluster . in table 1",
    "we list the asca and rosat observations of gl quasars with detected x - rays .    the spatial resolution for on axis pointing of the rosat hri , rosat pspc and asca gis is about 5@xmath13 , 25@xmath13 and 3@xmath14 respectively .",
    "thus only for the rosat hri observation of q0957 + 561 was it possible to resolve the lensed x - ray images ( chartas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "for the data reduction of the asca and rosat observations we used the ftools package xselect .",
    "the asca sis data used in this study were all taken in bright mode and high , medium and low bit rate data were included in the analysis .",
    "we created response matrices and ancillary files for each chip using the ftools tasks sisrmg and ascaarf respectively . for the rosat pspc data reduction we used the response matrix pspcb_gain2_256.rmf supplied by the rosat gof and created ancillary files using the ftools task pcarf .",
    "net events shown in table 1 are corrected for background , vignetting , exposure and point spread function effects using the source analysis tool _ sosta _ ( part of the software package ximage ) .    for the spectral analyses we are mostly limited by the energy resolution and counting statistics to fitting simple absorbed power - law models to the data .",
    "in addition to spectral fits in the quasar rest frame we also performed spectral fits in the observer s reference frame to facilitate the comparison of our results to those of previous studies . in table 2",
    "we show the results from fits of absorbed power - law models within three quasar rest frame energy intervals . in most cases",
    "no data are available in the soft interval since the corresponding observed energy interval is redshifted below the low energy quantum efficiency cutoff of the rosat xrt / pspc .",
    "to estimate any significant difference of the spectral properties of our gl sample from those of unlensed quasar samples we computed the merit function , @xmath15 , defined by the expression ,    @xmath16^{2}}\\over{{\\sigma_{ul}}^{2}(i)}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17(i ) and @xmath18(i ) are the spectral indices of the gl and unlensed quasar sample respectively , @xmath19 are the errors of the spectral indices of the unlensed samples and n is the number of spectral indices compared .",
    "we computed the merit function between our data set and that of fiore et al .",
    "1998 . for the comparison we computed the spectral indices @xmath20(0.1 - 0.8 kev ) and @xmath21(0.4 - 2.4 kev ) in",
    "the quasar observed frames . incorporating the 1@xmath22 uncertainties in the fitted values for the gl spectral indices we obtain a distribution of values for the merit function with a most likely value of @xmath15 @xmath10 0.5 with n = 7 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no significant difference at the @xmath23 = 0.3 level between our lensed sample and the fiore et al .",
    "1998 sample .",
    "spectral modeling of the radio - loud and ( non - bal ) radio - quiet quasars of our gl sample that have unlensed x - ray fluxes ranging between 3 @xmath3 10@xmath11 and 1 @xmath3 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 have indices that are consistent with those of brighter quasars ( see figure 7 ) . in spite of the fact that most of the quasars in our sample have intervening absorption systems ( see comments on individual systems ) we find that the estimated photon indices for the very faint non - bal quasars of our sample do not approach the level of 1.4 of the hard x - ray background .    in figure 8",
    "we also show that the photon indices of our gl quasar sample do not show any signs of hardenning over a range of three orders of magnitude in unlensed 2 - 10kev luminosity .",
    "the three apparently harder spectra of figure 7 and figure 8 correspond to two bal quasars and one absorbed blazar of our sample .",
    "the x - ray spectra of bal quasars that are modeled as power - laws with galactic absorption and no intrinsic absorption will erroneously imply relatively low photon indices .",
    "for example , spectral fits of a simple power - law plus galactic absorption model to the x - ray spectrum of pg1115 + 080 ( fit 1 , table 8) yields a relatively low photon index of 1.4 .",
    "the presently available spectra of the two bal quasars of our sample have poor s / n and can not provide significant constrains on the intrinsic absorber column densities .",
    "the apparent surface brightness of gravitationally lensed images is a conserved quantity , however the observed x - ray flux is amplified due to the geometric distortion of the gl images .",
    "the lensed quasar images of our sample are not spatially resolved so we only observe the total magnification of the x - ray flux and not the spatial distortion of the image .",
    "gravitational lensing is in general an achromatic effect , however possible differential absorption in the multiple images , microlensing from stars in the lens galaxy and source spectral variability combined with the expected time delay between photon arrival for each image may produce distinct features in the multiply lensed spectrum of the quasar .",
    "we estimated the unlensed x - ray luminosity of the quasars in our sample by scaling the lensed luminosity determined from the spectral fits to the gl magnification factors .",
    "the magnification parameters were derived from fits of singular isothermal ellipsoid sie lens models ( keeton , kochanek , & falco , 1997 ) to optical and radio observables ( e.g. image and lens positions and flux ratios ) and incorporating the best fit parameters to derive the convergence , @xmath25 , of the lens .    for a sie",

    "the radio - quiet quasar sbs0909 + 532 was recently identified as a candidate gravitational lens system with a source redshift of 1.377 , and an image separation of 1.107@xmath13 .",
    "the lens has not yet been clearly identified , however , gl statistics place the most likely redshift for the lens galaxy at z@xmath36 @xmath37 0.5 with 90@xmath0 confidence bounds of 0.18 @xmath38 z@xmath36 @xmath38 0.83 ( kochanek et al .",

    "the optical data at this point can not clearly discern whether the heavy - element absorber is associated with the lensing galaxy .",
    "we searched the heasarc archive and found a bright x - ray source within 7@xmath13 of the optical location of sbs0909 + 532 , well within the error bars of the rosat pointing accuracy of @xmath10 30@xmath13 .",
