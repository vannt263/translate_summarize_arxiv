    "in 200304 , the na48/2 experiment has collected at the cern sps the world largest sample of charged kaon decays , with the main goal of searching for direct cp violation in the @xmath5 decays  @xcite . in 200708 , the na62 experiment ( @xmath0 phase ) collected a large minimum bias data sample with the same detector but modified data taking conditions , with the main goal of measuring the ratio of the rates of the @xmath6 decays ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the large statistics accumulated by both experiments has allowed the studies of a range of rare @xmath8 decay modes .",
    "the main stage of the na62 experiment , expected to start physics data taking in 2014 , aims at measuring the @xmath4 decay rate .",
    "the recent results and prospects of these experiments are discussed here .",
    "the beam line has been designed to deliver simultaneous narrow momentum band @xmath9 and @xmath10 beams derived from the primary 400 gev/@xmath11 protons extracted from the cern sps .",
    "central beam momenta of 60 gev/@xmath11 and 74 gev/@xmath11 have been used .",
    "the beam kaons decayed in a fiducial decay volume contained in a 114  m long cylindrical vacuum tank .",
    "a detailed description of the detector used in 200308 is available in  @xcite .",
    "the momenta of charged decay products are measured in a magnetic spectrometer , housed in a tank filled with helium placed after the decay volume .",
    "the spectrometer comprises four drift chambers ( dchs ) , two upstream and two downstream of a dipole magnet which gives a horizontal transverse momentum kick of @xmath12 or @xmath13 to singly - charged particles .",
    "each dch is composed of eight planes of sense wires . a plastic scintillator hodoscope ( hod ) producing fast trigger signals and providing precise time measurements of charged particles",
    "is placed after the spectrometer . a 127  cm thick liquid krypton ( lkr ) electromagnetic calorimeter located further downstream is used for lepton identification and as a photon veto detector .",

    "decays of pseudoscalar mesons to light leptons ( @xmath16 , denoted @xmath17 below ) are suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) by helicity considerations .",
    "ratios of leptonic decay rates of the same meson can be computed very precisely : in particular , the sm prediction for the ratio @xmath18 is  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an electromagnetic correction . within extensions of the sm involving two higgs doublets",
    ", @xmath0 is sensitive to lepton flavour violating effects induced by loop processes with the charged higgs boson ( @xmath21 ) exchange  @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has concluded that @xmath0 can be enhanced by @xmath22 within the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "however , the potential new physics effects are constrained by other observables such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 decay rates  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 is sensitive to the neutrino mixing parameters within sm extensions involving a fourth generation of quarks and leptons  @xcite .",
    "the analysis strategy is based on counting the numbers of reconstructed @xmath25 and @xmath26 candidates collected concurrently .",
    "therefore the analysis does not rely on the absolute beam flux measurement , and several systematic effects cancel at first order .",
    "the study is performed independently for 40 data samples ( 10 bins of reconstructed lepton momentum and 4 samples with different data taking conditions ) by computing the ratio @xmath0 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the numbers of selected @xmath29 candidates @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the numbers of background events , @xmath32 is the geometric acceptance correction , @xmath33 are the efficiencies of @xmath34/@xmath35 identification , @xmath36 are the trigger efficiencies , @xmath37 is the global efficiency of the lkr calorimeter readout ( which provides the information used for electron identification ) , and @xmath38 is the downscaling factor of the @xmath39 trigger .",
    "the data sample is characterized by high values of @xmath33 and @xmath36 well above 99% .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is used to evaluate the acceptance correction and the geometric part of the acceptances for most background processes entering the computation of @xmath40 .",
    "particle identification , trigger and readout efficiencies and the beam halo background are measured directly from control data samples .",
    "two selection criteria are used to distinguish @xmath25 and @xmath39 decays .",
    "kinematic identification is based on the reconstructed squared missing mass assuming the track to be a electron or a muon : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are the kaon and lepton 4-momenta ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mm2 ] ) . a selection condition @xmath45",
    "is applied ; @xmath46 vary across the lepton momentum bins depending on resolution .",
    "lepton type identification is based on the ratio @xmath47 of energy deposit in the lkr calorimeter to track momentum measured by the spectrometer .",
    "particles with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are identified as electrons ( muons ) , where @xmath50 is 0.90 or 0.95 , depending on momentum .",

    "@xmath53 has been measured as a function of momentum using dedicated data samples .",
    "the contributions to the systematic uncertainty of the result include the uncertainties on the backgrounds , helium purity in the spectrometer tank ( which influences the detection efficiency via bremsstrahlung and scattering ) , beam simulation , spectrometer alignment , particle identification and trigger efficiency .",
    "the result of the measurement , combined over the 40 independent samples taking into account correlations between the systematic errors , is @xmath54 the stability of @xmath0 measurements in lepton momentum bins and for the separate data samples is shown in fig .",

    "the result is consistent with the standard model expectation , and the achieved precision dominates the world average .",
    "measurements of radiative non - leptonic kaon decays provide crucial tests for the ability of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) to explain weak low energy processes . in the chpt framework , the @xmath3 decay receives two non - interfering contributions at lowest non - trivial order @xmath55 : the pion and kaon _ loop amplitude _ depending on an unknown @xmath56 constant @xmath57 representing the total contribution of the counterterms , and the _ pole amplitude _  @xcite .",
    "higher order unitarity corrections from @xmath58 decays , including the main @xmath59 contribution as well as those beyond @xmath59 due to using the phenomenological values of @xmath58 amplitudes , have been found to modify the decay spectrum significantly ; in particular , they lead to non - zero differential decay rate at zero diphoton invariant mass  @xcite . the total decay rate is predicted to be @xmath60 , with the pole amplitude contributing 5% or less  @xcite .",

    "the latter set has been collected with a set of downscaled trigger conditions with an effective downscaling factor of about 20 .",

[ fig : pigg - z ]    the data spectra of the @xmath69 kinematic variable , together with the signal and background expectations , are displayed in fig .",

    "the values of the @xmath57 parameter in the framework of the chpt @xmath55 and @xmath59 parameterizations according to  @xcite have been measured by the performing likelihood fits to the data .",
    "the preliminary results of the fits are presented in table  [ tab : chat ] : they are in agreement with the earlier bnl e787 ones .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by the statistical ones ; the systematic errors and mainly due to uncertainties of the background estimates .",
    "the @xmath59 parametrization involves a number of external inputs . in this analysis ,",
    "they have been fixed as follows : the polynomial contribution terms are @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 as suggested in  @xcite , while the @xmath73 amplitude parameters come from a fit to the experimental data  @xcite . along with the separate 2004 and 2007 results ,",

    "the combination takes into account the large positive correlation of the systematic uncertainties of the two measurements .",
    ".the preliminary results of the fits to the @xmath3 diphoton mass spectra to the chpt parameterizations  @xcite .",
    "the quoted br values correspond to the full kinematic range . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "among the flavour changing neutral current @xmath74 and @xmath75 decays , the @xmath76 decays play a key role in the search for new physics through the underlying mechanisms of flavour mixing .",
    "these decays are strongly suppressed in the sm ( the highest ckm suppression ) , and are dominated by top - quark loop contributions .",
    "the sm branching ratios have been computed to an exceptionally high precision with respect to other loop - induced meson decays : @xmath77 and @xmath78 ; the uncertainties are dominated by parametric ones , and the irreducible theoretical uncertainties are at a @xmath79 level  @xcite .",
    "the extreme theoretical cleanness of these decays remains also in certain new physics scenarios .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath4 decay has been observed by the bnl e787/e949 experiments , and the measured branching ratio is @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the achieved precision is inferior to that of the sm expectation .",
    "the main goal of the na62 experiment at cern is the measurement of the @xmath4 decay rate at the 10% precision level , which would constitute a significant test of the sm .",
    "the experiment is expected to collect about 100 signal events in two years of data taking , keeping the systematic uncertainties and backgrounds low . assuming a 10% signal acceptance and the sm decay rate",
    ", the kaon flux should correspond to at least @xmath81 @xmath9 decays in the fiducial volume . in order to achieve a small systematic uncertainty , a rejection factor for generic kaon decays of the order of @xmath82",
    "is required , and the background suppression factors need to be measured directly from the data . in order to achieve the required kaon intensity , signal acceptance and background suppression , most of the na48/na62 apparatus used until 2008 is being replaced with new detectors .",
    "the cern sps extraction line used by the na48 experiment is capable of delivering beam intensity sufficient for the na62 .",
    "consequently the new setup is housed at the cern north area high intensity facility where the na48 was located .",
    "the decay in flight technique will be used ; optimisation of the signal acceptance drives the choice of a 75 gev/@xmath11 charged kaon beam with 1% momentum bite .",
    "the experimental setup is conceptually similar to the one used for na48 : a @xmath83  m long beam line to form the appropriate secondary beam , a @xmath84  m long evacuated decay volume , and a series of downstream detectors measuring the secondary particles from the @xmath9 decays in the fiducial decay volume .",
    "the signal signature is one track in the final state matched to one @xmath9 track in the beam .",
    "the integrated rate upstream is about 800 mhz ( only 6% of the beam particles are kaons , the others being mostly @xmath63 and protons ) .",
    "the rate seen by the detector downstream is about 10 mhz , mainly due to @xmath9 decays .",
    "timing and spatial information are required to match the upstream and downstream track .",
    "backgrounds come from kaon decays with a single reconstructed track in the final state , including accidentally matched upstream and downstream tracks .",
    "the background suppression profits from the high kaon beam momentum . a variety of techniques will be employed in combination in order to reach the required level of background rejection .",
    "they can be schematically divided into kinematic rejection , precise timing , highly efficient photon and muon veto systems , and precise particle identification systems to distinguish @xmath63 , @xmath9 and positrons .",
    "the above requirements drove the design and the construction of the subdetector systems .",
    "the main na62 subdetectors are : a differential cherenkov counter ( cedar ) on the beam line to identify the @xmath9 in the beam ; a silicon pixel beam tracker ; guard - ring counters surrounding the beam tracker to veto catastrophic interactions of particles ; a downstream spectrometer composed of 4 straw chambers operating in vacuum ; a rich detector to distinguish pions and muons ; a scintillator hodoscope ; a muon veto detector .",
    "the photon veto detectors will include a series of annular lead glass calorimeters surrounding the decay and detector volume , the na48 lkr calorimeter , and two small angle calorimeters to provide hermetic coverage for photons emitted at close to zero angle to the beam .",
    "the design of the experimental apparatus and the r&d of the new subdetectors have been completed .",
    "the experiment is under construction , and the first technical run is scheduled for october  december 2012 .",
    "the na48/2 and na62 experiments at cern have recently accomplished several precision measurements of rare @xmath8 decays .",
    "the @xmath0 phase of the na62 experiment provided the most precise measurement of the ratio of leptonic @xmath8 decay rates @xmath85 .",
    "this result is consistent with the sm expectation , and constrains multi - higgs and fourth generation new physics scenarios . na48/2 and",
    "na62 experiments have performed new measurements of the @xmath3 decay , significantly improving the precision of chpt tests with this channel .",
    "the ultra - rare @xmath4 decay represents a unique environment to search for new physics .",
    "the na62 experiment , aiming to collect @xmath86 events of this decay , is being constructed and is preparing for a technical run in 2012 .",
