    "one of the problems of the @xmath1cdm hierarchical merging paradigm in local scale is that the observed number of the remaining `` building blocks '' in the milky way is about an order of magnitude smaller than the predicted number of subhalos ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "despite the recent progress in searching for the ultra faint dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although it is widely accepted by the community that almost all gcs were initially much more massive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "more massive gcs in the milky way bulge are expected to have this characteristic @xcite .",
    "detailed studies for these gcs , however , are hampered by highly obscured environment in which they are placed .",
    "the near ir photometry and spectroscopy would be ideal probes to detect any evidence for multiple populations in these gcs as shown , for example , by @xcite for the case of terzan  5 . as suggested by (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , in the case of mildly obscured gcs in the bulge , however , the combination of narrow - band ca photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy can effectively disentangle the reddening and metallicity effects . the purpose of this letter is to report our discovery , by employing this technique , that ngc  6273 also belongs to this growing body of gcs .",
    "our observations , both narrow - band ca photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy , were made on the du pont 2.5 m telescope at las campanas observatory during the 14 nights from 2011 to 2014 .",
    "the narrow - band ca photometry covered 15 @xmath5 15 field centered on the cluster .",
    "total exposure times for the central region ( 9 @xmath5 9 ) were 12600 , 2520 , and 1260 sec for ca , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 filters , respectively , and those for the outer regions were 3600 , 720 , and 360 sec .",
    "the low - resolution spectroscopy was performed on the multi - object spectroscopic mode of the wide field reimaging ccd ( wfccd ) in the same field covered by the photometry .",
    "the exposure times were between 1200 and 1800 sec , depending on the magnitude of the target stars in the masks .",
    "for the data reduction , both for the photometry and spectroscopy , we followed the same manner described in paper i ",
    "iraf for the preprocessing , daophot ii / allstar and allframe @xcite for the point spread function photometry , and the modified wfccd reduction package ( @xcite ; paper i ) for the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "readers are referred to paper i for the details of procedures adopted in our data reduction .    figure  [ f : cmd ] shows color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for ngc  6273 in ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) planes , where the @xmath10 index is defined as @xmath11ca@xmath12 @xcite . as described in paper i , stars affected by adjacent starlight contamination and bad measurements were rejected ( i.e. , @xmath13 @xmath140.5 , @xmath15 @xmath2 1.5 , and sharp @xmath2 @xmath16 ) .",
    "we adopted more rigorous criterion as to the @xmath13 index ( less than 0.5 instead of 1.0 as adopted in paper i ) because of a larger field star contamination in the bulge field where ngc 6273 is placed .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ f : cmd ] show all stars in our program field , where the field star contamination ( mostly main - sequence stars in the disk and red giant branch stars in the bulge ) is evident .",
    "the stars within 3 from the cluster center are shown in the middle panels where the cmd features from the cluster members are more clearly visible . in these panels ,",
    "the most notable feature is the presence of two distinct red giant branch ( rgb ) subpopulations in the ( @xmath9 ) cmd , while this split is not apparent in the ( @xmath8 ) cmd , suggesting a difference in calcium abundance between the two rgb sequences .",
    "note that this spilt is also present on the sub giant branch in the ( @xmath9 ) cmd .",

    "the target stars are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ f : cmd ] , and figure  [ f : spc ] shows measured indices as functions of @xmath7 magnitude .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ f : spc ] are the differences in hk@xmath21 and cn indices ( @xmath22hk@xmath21 and @xmath22cn ) measured from the least - square fits ( black solid lines in left panels ) to show only the abundance effect at fixed temperature and gravity ( see paper i ) .",
    "the mean differences in @xmath22hk@xmath21 and @xmath22cn indices between the two subpopulations are 0.05 dex and 0.31 dex , respectively , in the sense that the redder rgb stars are more enhanced .",
    "these differences are significant at 6.3@xmath23 level for @xmath22hk@xmath21 and at 6.4@xmath23 level for @xmath22cn compared to the standard deviation of the mean for each group .",

    "the blue and red solid lines are the least - square lines for each subpopulation , respectively .",
    "the red dashed line indicates the expected locus of redder rgb stars if the rgb split is due to the reddening . ]",
    "since some differential reddening is reported in the field toward ngc  6273 ( @xmath17@xmath25@xmath260.2 ; @xcite ) , it is important to check whether the rgb split is affected by the reddening . in order to examine this",
    ", we plot hk@xmath21 index versus @xmath24 color in figure  [ f : redding ] .",
    "if the rgb split is due to the reddening , the redder rgb stars would be placed on the right side in this diagram or around the red dashed line . however , the observed redder rgb stars are located in the opposite regime as would be expected if they are enhanced in hk@xmath21 .",
    "this confirms , together with the discrete distribution of the two rgb sequences on the cmd , that the effect from the differential reddening , if any , is not significant .",
    "furthermore , note that the @xmath10 index has a little dependence on the reddening , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "the solid and dashed lines indicate , respectively , the mean value and @xmath291@xmath23 error of the mean for each subpopulation . ]",
    "we have shown that the rgb stars in ngc  6273 are divided into two distinct subgroups in the narrow - band ca photometry .",
    "our low - resolution spectroscopy confirms that the origin of this split is indeed due to the difference in calcium abundance between the two rgbs . after the draft of this paper",
    "was completed , the iron spread in this gc was recently reported by @xcite from high - resolution spectroscopy of 18 rgb stars . while this result is qualitatively consistent with our finding ,",
    "the discrete nature of the metallicity distribution function is more clearly shown in this investigation from the narrow - band ca photometry for @xmath261,600 rgb stars , together with the low - resolution spectroscopy for 78 stars .    in order to see whether the calcium enhanced stars in our sample are similarly enhanced in iron abundance , in panel ( a ) of figure  [ f : comspc ] , we have cross - matched stars in @xcite with those in our sample ( filled circles ) .",
    "the two subpopulations were defined from the photometry by the difference in @xmath17@xmath10 from the fiducial line as described in section 2 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the calcium enhanced stars in our observations are enhanced in [ fe / h ] as well , with the difference of 0.2 dex ( 4.0@xmath23 level ) .",
    "calcium abundance obtained from johnson et al .",
    "( 2015 ) in panel ( c ) also confirms the difference in [ ca / h ] ( 0.24 dex , 4.4@xmath23 level ) .. however , when [ mg / h ] is plotted , instead of [ mg / fe ] , we found no difference between the two groups as correctly pointed out by the referee .",
    "this confirms that the apparent difference in [ mg / fe ] is only the reflex of the variation in fe between the two subpopulations .",
    "] we also compare the ca ii triplet measurements of @xcite with our photometry ( open circles ) , where the difference in [ ca / h ] was deduced from their reduced equivalent widths ( @xmath30ca@xmath31 ) . in this case , the mean difference in [ ca / h ] between the two subpopulations is 0.16 dex , which is significant at 9.3@xmath23 level ( see panel ( d ) ) .",
    "figure  [ f : cnch ] presents the correlation between @xmath22cn and @xmath22ch for the rgb stars in ngc  6273 , which shows a positive correlation .",
    "as discussed in paper i ( see figure 13 ) , most `` normal '' gcs show anti - correlation between cn and ch , while some massive gcs enriched by sne , such as m22 , show positive correlation .",
    "it was suggested in paper i that this systematic difference would reflect how strongly sne have enriched the later generation of stars .",
    "the fact that ngc  6273 is following the same trend observed in m22 is also consistent with our conclusion that the chemical evolution in this gc was relatively strongly affected by sne .",
    "this further suggests that ngc  6273 was massive enough to retain sne ejecta , which would place this cluster in the growing group of gcs with galactic building block origin , such as @xmath0  cen and terzan  5 . in particular ,",
    "this places ngc  6273 as the first metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath18 -1.5 ) gc in the bulge field with this characteristic ."
