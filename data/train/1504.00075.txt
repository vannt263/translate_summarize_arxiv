    "the primordial gas would not be able to collapse sufficiently quickly within the center of dark matter halos to form the galaxies we observe @xcite .",
    "total mass - density profiles of spiral galaxies were obtained decades ago , given the simple geometry of their spiral disks and the availability of ionized @xcite and neutral gas @xcite , which provides a kinematical tracer easy to measure and model ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements indicated flat circular rotation curves and consequently nearly - isothermal @xmath14 profiles .",
    "the situation is very different for early - type galaxies ( etgs : ellipticals and lenticulars ) , which by definition lack well - defined spiral disks and are cold - gas poor . for etgs one",
    "usually has to rely on expensive observations of the stellar kinematics and more complex dynamical models .",
    "this has restricted most studies to radii not much larger than the half - light radius .",
    "a general consensus has emerged for the mass distribution of the etgs inner parts .",
    "long - slit observations of two different samples of @xmath15 etgs revealed rotation curves to be nearly flat with nearly - isothermal mass profiles , as in spiral galaxies , within the median radius @xmath16 sampled by the kinematics @xcite .",
    "this agrees with strong gravitational lensing studies finding nearly - isothermal slopes , with small scatter , for the _ total _ galaxy density profile of 73 etgs , at a typical radius of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these central slopes are similar to those measured for group / cluster - scale profiles using x - ray modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or stacked weak - lensing technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the largest detailed study of dark matter in galaxy centers was based on the integral - field observations of the volume - limited atlas@xmath1  sample of 260 etgs @xcite .",
    "it inferred a median dark matter fraction of just @xmath17 , within a sphere of radius , over the full sample @xcite .",
    "_ this shows that studies restricted to the central regions of etgs mainly measure the stellar mass distribution . _    to explore the region where dark matter dominates , one needs to reach at least @xmath18 .",
    "existing studies at these radii targeted one galaxy at a time .",
    "they used observations of extended hi disks @xcite , deep stellar kinematics at a few sparse locations @xcite , globular cluster kinematics @xcite and planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "the fact that galaxies were modeled using different techniques or kinematic tracers , and for a mix of etgs with axisymmetric and triaxial shapes , resulted in a still unclear picture of the global trends .",
    "tentative conclusions suggest a trend with massive etgs having nearly isothermal total mass profiles and flat circular velocities ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while lower mass ones have more slowly rising dark matter profiles and correspondingly falling circular velocity profiles ( also * ? ? ?",
    ".    the situation is changing with the availability of extended stellar kinematics for significant samples of etgs @xcite . here",
    "we present the first detailed and fully homogeneous analysis using larges - scale stellar dynamics of a statistically significant sample of 14 etgs ( but see @xcite for less detailed models ) .",
    "the key novelty of this work is the availability of _ two - dimensional _ stellar kinematics out to a median radius for the sample of @xmath19 from the sluggs survey @xcite , which we combine with integral - field kinematics in the central regions ( @xmath20 ) from the atlas@xmath1  survey @xcite .",
    "we study a subsample of the sluggs etg sample , with kinematics from @xcite .",
    "we want a homogeneous set of galaxies and we use an axisymmetric dynamical modelling method . for this reason we only select etgs classified as fast rotator in @xcite .",
    "we add the fast rotator ngc  3115 , without atlas@xmath1  kinematics .",
    "our sample of 14 galaxies is given in ( stellar masses @xmath0 from @xcite ) .",
    "fast rotators were shown by @xcite to have kinematical axes , within about 1 , extremely well aligned with the _ photometric _ major axes measured at the much larger radii @xmath21 sampled by the sluggs kinematics .",
    "this alignment , for the statistically - significant , atlas@xmath1  sample , shows that fast rotator etgs , as a class , must be axisymmetric out to the region sampled by our models .",
    "significant deviations from axisymmetry would produce a broad distribution of kinematical misalignment that is clearly ruled out by the atlas@xmath1  data .",
    "the sluggs kinematics of fast rotators is also generally consistent with axisymmetry and shows small kinematical misalignment .",
    "some genuine deviations from a bi - symmetric velocity field do exist in the sluggs data .",
    "notable examples are ngc  4494 in the maps of @xcite and ngc  4473 in @xcite",
    ". however , these deviations are more likely due to unrelaxed substructure in the stellar halo , than to non - axisymmetry in the relaxed stellar distribution .",
    "in fact , the tight alignment between atlas@xmath1  stellar kinematics and photometry , as well as the complete lack of photometric twist , is extremely unlikely in a triaxial configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this work",
    "we attribute deviations from the axisymmetric assumption to either sub - structure or systematic problems in the data , and simply try to remove their effects from our models .",
    "we use the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) @xcite to parametrize both stellar and dark halo distributions .",
    "the mges of 8 galaxies come from @xcite and one from @xcite .",
    "they include deep @xmath22-band photometry out to 510 .",
    "three sdss @xmath23-band mges come from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24-band mge for ngc  3115 comes from @xcite .",
    "the mge for ngc4111 was redone on the @xmath25-band sdss image using the python version of the mge - fitting method of @xcite , to avoid the @xmath23-band saturation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* supplementary material ) .",
    "the kinematics for the inner ( @xmath20 ) region of our galaxies was observed with the sauron integral - field spectrograph and was homogeneously extracted for the atlas@xmath1  survey as described in @xcite . for 10/14 galaxies the observations , taken as part of the sauron survey ,",
    "were already presented in @xcite .",
    "the kinematics for the outer regions were observed with the keck / deimos multi - slit spectrograph by the sluggs survey .",
    "they were presented and described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , in both cases the kinematics were extracted in pixel space using the ppxf method @xcite .",
    "the atlas@xmath1  data covered the h@xmath26 and mg  @xmath27 spectral region ( 48005380  ) and were extracted using the full miles stellar library @xcite as templates . while the sluggs data covered the triplet spectral region ( 8480 - 8750  ) and were extracted using the stellar library of @xcite .",
    "a key step of this analysis is the removal of potential outliers from the sluggs kinematics .",
    "these may have significant effects on the modeling results , owing to the relatively sparse sampling of the kinematics at large radii .",
    "when fitting kinematics to models , one can enforce symmetry during the kinematic extraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt here a conceptually similar idea , which is easier to apply to irregularly sampled or discrete kinematics ( see also @xcite ) .    at every observed location @xmath28 on the sky , where the @xmath29-axis coincides with the kinematic major axis pa@xmath30 ( taken from @xcite )",
    ", we calculate the rms velocity @xmath31 from the sluggs data , where @xmath32 is the mean stellar velocity and @xmath33 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "we then generate a new set of bi - symmetric positions by replicating four times the observed values as follows : @xmath34 the measurement uncertainties are increased by @xmath35 . given the bi - symmetry of the model , the @xmath36 statistics , describing the quality of the fit , is unchanged",
    ". applies to the even velocity moments like @xmath37 and @xmath38 . while for the odd velocity moments like @xmath24 ,",
    "the last line is replaced by : @xmath39 the resulting kinematics measurements are then smoothed with the ( python version ) of the two - dimensional loess algorithm of @xcite , implemented@xmath40 by @xcite ( see example in ) .",
    "comparison between the smoothed / cleaned @xmath41 and the original one suggests the sluggs error being underestimated due to systematics , with typical errors of @xmath42 ( ) .",
    "the original errors would indicate non - smooth kinematics , which seems inconsistent with the smooth galaxy images .    in the following models we do not fit the original kinematics , but",
    "the symmetrized / smoothed one .",
    "this has the added benefit of making the agreement between data and model easy to visually assess .",
    "we need to verify that our models capture the global features of the data , and that our results are not driven by a few deviant values .",
    "this is important in situations where data systematics may be present and relying entirely on @xmath36 statistics may be misleading .",
    "another issue for the modeling is the fact that the atlas@xmath1  observations consist of many more data points with smaller uncertainties , which completely dominate the @xmath36 estimate .",
    "however here we want our dark halo determinations to be especially constrained by the sluggs data , which sample the region where the halo dominates .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we increase the size of the atlas@xmath1  kinematic uncertainties so that , for a good fit , the two datasets provide an equal contribution to the @xmath36 .",
    "we leave the sluggs uncertainties unchanged , to retain properly normalized confidence levels for our model parameters .",
    "the sluggs @xmath37 at the sauron locations tend to be lower than the measured sauron values .",
    "we find a median offset of 11% , which is larger than the 5% level we consider unavoidable between independent datasets .",
    "this offset was noted by @xcite , but its source is unknown .",
    "the atlas@xmath1  data agree on average with hundreds of independent determinations from the literature ( fig .",
    "8 of @xcite ) , suggesting the sluggs data may be offset with respect to the optical literature . here",
    "we simply multiply the sluggs @xmath37 to fit , for each galaxy , the interpolated sauron data at the same locations .",
    "this is the standard kinematics we fit with our models .",
    "however , importantly , we have also run all our models with the sluggs data alone , and confirmed that the slopes of the total mass profiles agree with those of our standard models .",
    "we model the atlas@xmath1  and sluggs stellar kinematics using the ( python version ) of the axisymmetric jeans anisotropic modeling ( jam ) method@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the approach is the same used in @xcite for the atlas@xmath1  data alone .",
    "it employs a bayesian method with constant ( i.e. , ` ignorant ' ) priors on all parameters .",
    "the key difference between this work and previous stellar dynamical studies of dark halos in etgs is the fact that we place virtually no constraint on the halo profile parameters .",
    "the halo is assumed to be spherical , but is described by a generalized @xcite profile ( gnfw ) with free normalization , inner slope and break radius : @xmath43    our models have 7 free parameters . some are poorly constrained but are not of interest here .",
    "they are just ` nuisance parameters ' , marginalized over to derive the total mass profiles studied here .",
    "the parameters are : ( i ) the inclination @xmath25 ; ( ii ) the anisotropy @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the stellar dispersion in cylindrical coordinates , for the mge gaussians with @xmath47 ; ( iii ) the anisotropy for the remaining gaussians at larger radii ; ( iv ) the stellar @xmath48 ; ( v ) the break radius of the dark halo , constrained to be @xmath49 kpc ; ( vi ) the halo density @xmath50 at @xmath51 ; and ( vii ) the dark halo slope @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the first result is the simple fact that the models provide a good description of the stellar kinematics of all the modeled galaxies over the full field ( , [ fig : jam_fits2 ] and ) .",
    "this was not expected .",
    "it would have been natural if we had employed e.g. the more general orbit - superposition method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is fully described by thousands of parameters . however our models have just six non - linear parameters and one scaling factor @xmath48 .",
    "moreover the fits look similarly good even assuming a power - law halo and a constant - anisotropy stellar body ( four nonlinear parameters and one scaling factor ) .",
    "the fact that four parameters are able to consistently describe all features of the two - dimensional maps , for the full set of 14 galaxies , then indicates that ( i ) the ( cleaned ) sluggs data are reliable and ( ii ) the model assumptions provide a good description of the dynamics and mass distribution of the real galaxies .",
    "an alternative interpretation for the good fits would be that the anisotropy and dark matter variations , and data systematics , conspire to mimic the simple orbital structure and mass distribution assumed by the models .",
    "this would be a realistic possibility when studying a single galaxy , given the non full generality of the jam models , but such a conspiracy is unlikely for such a large and diverse set of galaxies .",
    "the second and main result of this work is that all 14 modeled fast - rotator etgs have a nearly - isothermal @xmath14 _ total _ density distribution from @xmath54 out to the median radius of 4  sampled by this study ( ( a ) ) .",
    "total _ mass - density profiles\\ , { \\rm erf}\\left[r\\sqrt{1-q_j^2}/(q_j\\sigma_j\\sqrt{2})\\right]}{4\\pi\\sigma_j^2 r\\sqrt{1-q_j^2}}$ ] ] , marginalized over all nuisance parameters , are tightly constrained by the data . in the whole range @xmath55 the profiles",
    "are well described by a power - law @xmath56 with the largest average deviation of 11% .",
    "the corresponding average logarithmic slope is @xmath3 for the sample , with an rms scatter of just @xmath4 .",
    "we do not detect any significant correlation of the slope with , stellar mass , or stellar velocity dispersion . for @xmath57",
    "the average slope is @xmath58 with @xmath59 , while for @xmath60 we find @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "our inner - profile slope and scatter are in excellent agreement with those @xmath63 with @xmath64 found around @xmath5 using strong lensing @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) shows that the observed trend is consistent with what one would predict for the whole atlas@xmath1  sample , for cosmologically - motivated _ uncontracted _ nfw halos . in ( c ) , the stellar profiles are very different from the total ones at the radii we sample : they have slopes @xmath65 around @xmath5 ( fig .  2 of @xcite ) but fall off more steeply than @xmath66 around @xmath19 .",
    "\\(d ) compares our total profiles with published ones for ngc  0821 , ngc  2974 , ngc  4494 , ngc  4649 , and ngc  4697 ( from * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath67 was derived from the circular velocities @xmath68 , assuming spherical symmetry . in 4/5 cases",
    "the agreement is excellent , with our _ statistical _ uncertainties enclosing the published profiles over the full radial range .",
    "notable is the tight agreement for ngc  2974 , where the @xmath68 was directly measured from a regular hi disk .",
    "we believe the disagreement for ngc  4494 may be due to the inclusion in @xcite models of the strong asymmetry in the sluggs data at @xmath69 .",
    "we excluded those data from our fits , but including them would improve the agreement .",
    "we combine the integral - field stellar kinematics from the atlas@xmath1  survey , within @xmath20 , with the two - dimensional stellar kinematics from the sluggs survey , out to a median radius of about 4 , and a maximum radius of 2.06.2 , for a sample of fast rotator early - type galaxies consistent with axisymmetry .",
    "we construct the first statistically significant set of detailed axisymmetric dynamical models of the two - dimensional stellar kinematics out to those large radii , where dark matter dominates .",
    "we find that the galaxies dynamics is well represented by few relatively simple assumptions .",
    "the models tightly constrain the _ total _ density profiles , which closely approximates the isothermal form @xmath14 , from /10 out to the median radius of 4  sampled by the data , with remarkably little scatter .",
    "the observed total mass distribution is not a generic prediction of @xmath70cdm and provides constraints on the models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our sample highlights the importance of similar studies on larger samples of galaxies , to provide a much needed benchmark for galaxy formation models . for this",
    ", studies like the present one , using deimos on keck or muse on the vlt , can be complemented with models of shallower data , but for much larger samples like manga @xcite . to be most useful , samples need to include both spiral and early - type galaxies .",
