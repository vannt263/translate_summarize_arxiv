    "scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) is a powerful method to investigate local transport properties of electronic nanostructures .",
    "typically the biased tip of a scanning force microscope is used to locally deplete ( in the case of algaas heterostructures , @xcite ) or change ( in the case of graphene , @xcite ) the carrier density below the tip .",
    "the conductance is monitored as a function of tip position resulting in so - called scanning gate images .",
    "important ingredients for the interpretation of such images are the shape and size of the tip - induced potential in the landscape of the electronic nanostructure . in the literature numbers for the size of the tip - induced potential at",
    "the fermi energy vary between a few tens of nm and more than 1 m depending on experimental setup and analysis procedure @xcite .",
    "since many nanostructures , such as quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) and quantum dots , are formed by suitably biased top gates , the effective electronic landscape is a superposition of the gate - defined and tip - induced potential .    in this paper",
    "we describe four different and complimentary methods which allow us to determine the effective size of the tip - induced potential at the fermi energy .",
    "the sample is a gate - defined ballistic cavity . with the additional tip - induced potential we measure the positions of the conductance plateaus formed by the tip - gate constrictions and how they shift as a function of tip position .",
    "equipped with this knowledge we also analyze the effects of gate screening on the detailed positions of observed features in scanning gate images .",

    "this crude estimate , which we call method i in the following , regards the tip - depleted region to be hard - wall , simplifies the detailed geometry , and neglects all screening and stray - capacitance effects caused by the surface gates .",
    "it should therefore be taken as an order of magnitude estimate .",

    "these lines run at approximately constant distance from the edge of the gate directly indicating @xmath38 m ( method iii ) as illustrated in e ) .",
    "this estimate is an order of magnitude agreement with the previous ones , given the fact that the density in the cavity may be enhanced compared to the constrictions ( although possibly reduced compared to the bulk ) , and given the distinct electrostatic environment formed by the surface gates .",
    "all previous estimates of @xmath26 neglected the long - range tails of the tip - induced potential .",
    "the long - range capacitive coupling of the tip to a qpc @xcite can be used to determine this tail quantitatively . to this end the tip , kept at constant voltage , is placed at several positions along the transport axis of the qpc . at each point the qpc depletion gate - voltage is determined .",

    "the radius of the tip - depleted region is found to increase linearly with the tip voltage .",
    "this linear behavior is understandable since the lorentzian is steep at the fermi energy and thus can be approximated as a straight line within the given range of tip voltages . for voltages above 3 v this assumption is not justified since the 2deg is no longer depleted .",
    "the change of @xmath26 with @xmath51 is approximately 80 nm / v for tips of any radius given the tip - surface and surface-2deg separation of 60 nm and 120 nm , respectively .",
    "the tip characterized by the measurements of figure 2 is now used to find the change of the depletion width at the borders of the gate - defined cavity i [ see a ) ] as a function of gate voltage . in order to get such spatial information , a set of 2d scans with the biased afm tip and varying gate voltages is taken . for a first set of five scans the voltage on @xmath10",

    "the values of @xmath60 are smaller , and they increase with fringe number ( tip position ) due to reduced screening of the gate voltage by the tip .",
