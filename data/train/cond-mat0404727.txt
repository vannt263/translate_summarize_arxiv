    "among the various proposals for quantum computation , quantum bits ( qubits ) in solid state materials , such as superconducting josephson junctions @xcite and quantum dots @xcite , have the advantage of scalability .",
    "proposals to implement a quantum computer using superconducting nanocircuits are proving to be very promising @xcite , and several experiments have already highlighted the quantum properties of these devices @xcite .",
    "such a coherent - two - level system constitutes a qubit and the quantum computation can be carried out as the unitary operation functioning on the multiple qubit system .",
    "essentially , this quantum coherence must be maintained during computation .",
    "however , it is difficult to avoid dephasing due to the system s interaction with its external environment .",
    "the dephasing is characterized by a dephasing time of @xmath0 .",
    "various environments can cause dephasing .",
    "background charge fluctuations ( bcfs ) have been observed in diverse kinds of systems @xcite . in nanoscale systems , bcfs are electrostatic potential fluctuations arising due to the dynamics of an electron , or a hole , on a charge trap . in particular , the charges in charge traps fluctuate with the lorentzian spectrum form , which is called random telegraph noise in the time domain @xcite .",
    "the random distribution of the positions of such dynamical charge traps and their time constants leads to bcfs or 1/f noise @xcite . in solid - state charge qubits , these bcfs result in a dynamical electrostatic disturbance and hence , dephasing .",
    "it should be noted that this dephasing process does not mean the qubit being entangled with the environment , but rather , that the stochastic evolution of an external classical field is suppressing the density matrix elements of the qubit after averaging out over statistically distributed samples .",
    "it has been shown that bcfs are important dephasing channels for a single josephson charge qubit system @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the effect of bcfs on the two - qubit - gate operation . to construct a controllable quantum computer ,",
    "one requires the suppression of dephasing and accurate universal quantum gate which consists of single qubit operations and two - qubit operations is required .",
    "therefore , to address these manipulations , we examine the dephasing of a coupled qubit system , which is an experimentally current topic .",
    "there is a lot of interest in understanding what causes dephasing and its role in these systems . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the dephasing in a josephson charge qubit system .",
    "sec iii is a brief conclusion .",
    "similar subjects are also discussed in terms of decoherence - free subspace in ref .",
    "the system under consideration is a pair of cooper pair boxes @xcite . under appropriate conditions ( charging energy @xmath1 and the josephson coupling @xmath2 are much larger than and temperatures @xmath3 ) only two charge states in each box are important , and the hamiltonian of the pair of qubits @xmath4 reads @xmath5 where the charge bases @xmath6 are expressed using pauli matrices . we chose the charge degeneracy point @xmath7 except for our last result , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are capacitance and gate bias of i - th cooper pair box .",
    "the environment is a set of bcfs electrostatistically coupled to the qubits @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron creation and annihilation operators of a charge trap , and the coupling with the qubit is such that each bcf produces a bistable extra bias @xmath15 . because the qubit hamiltonian consists of @xmath2 and @xmath16 , the dephasing is accompanied by dissipation .",
    "it should be noted that we evaluated a _ collective _ environment .",
    "the two cooper pair boxes feel the same fluctuations in our model .    using the environment variable @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a trace of the operator @xmath19 about the electron reservoir of the charge trap , we rewrite the perturbation hamiltonian in terms of the pauli matrix as @xmath20 where we denote that the charge trap is strongly coupled with its charge reservoir and the time evolution of @xmath21 is a poisson process ( bcf ) .",
    "we assume @xmath22 , which corresponds to dephasing due to a single trap where @xmath23 denotes the ensemble average and @xmath24 is the time constant of a bcf . in the interaction representation , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the ensemble averaged density matrix @xmath28 at time @xmath29 in a second - order perturbation approximation is , @xmath30 u_0^{\\dagger } ( t ) . $ ] the gate fidelity is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath34 , where the initial density matrix is @xmath35 . for simplicity",
    "we set @xmath36 .",
    "the solid lines denote @xmath37=20 and the dotted lines denote @xmath38 .",
    "we choose parameters @xmath39=0.5 and @xmath40 . at @xmath29=0 ,",
    "fidelity is 1 , and it decreases with time . in the short time regime @xmath41 ,",
    "the fidelities show @xmath42 .",
    "the lowest - order gaussian behavior @xmath43 originating from the term like @xmath44 $ ] is absent , since we started from a diagonal qubits density matrix . as @xmath45 increases , fidelity worsens @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of @xmath46 is larger than that of @xmath47 .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath48 only induces transitions between the ground state and the 2nd excited state of @xmath4 , and between the 2nd excited and the 3rd excited state . when @xmath16=0 , the sum of the dephasing rates for these two transitions is given by @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath16 increases , the dephasing rate decreases down to @xmath50 , since the dephasing by the transition between the ground state and the 2nd excited state is gradually suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus , the dephasing rate of @xmath51 is larger than that of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that interaction between the qubits leads to more reliable quantum gate operations .",
    "figure 2 shows the positive operator - value measurement ( povm ) results where @xmath52 is the sum of the density matrix elements of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with parameters @xmath55 ghz , @xmath56 ns , @xmath57 ghz , @xmath58 ghz and @xmath59ghz , which are the same as those in the experiment in ref .",
    "we compared the fourier spectrum for @xmath60 and that of @xmath61ghz .",
    "there are two peaks in fourier spectrum with finite width which correspond to different @xmath2 of qubit system .",
    "the spectrums also show that the peak widths of the qubit system are larger for @xmath62 .",
    "this signals that the dephasing due to bcf occurs , as we have shown in the analysis of gate fidelity . for fidelity , @xmath63=1 when @xmath60 and @xmath64 when @xmath62 .",
    "we also examined the time evolution of coherent transition between @xmath65 .",
    "we choose @xmath66 , @xmath67=152 ghz and @xmath59 ghz .",
    "this corresponds to single qubit coherence oscillation .",
    "the coherent oscillation is robust against bcf compared with the case of two - qubit operations .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the experiment ref .",
    "we speculate that this result depends on the way of the environment coupling to qubits .",
    "we examined the effect of bcf on the coupled qubit system during gate operation .",
    "the fluctuation leads to gate error , however quantum gate operation becomes more accurate with increasing interaction between qubit systems when one start from @xmath35 .",
