    "_ saturated graph_.    the famous turn problem in extremal combinatorics can be expressed naturally in the language of saturated graphs .",
    "the extremal number of @xmath15 , @xmath19 , ( often written as @xmath20 ) is usually defined as the maximum number of edges in an @xmath15-free subgraph of @xmath21 . however , it can equivalently be written as :    @xmath22    this formulation yields a natural ` opposite ' of the turn problem .",
    "we define the _ saturation number of @xmath15 _",
    ", @xmath23 as :    @xmath24    a variant of this is the _ semi - saturation number _ , @xmath25 .",
    "we say that a graph is _ @xmath17-semi - saturated _ if @xmath0 is a subgraph of @xmath16 and adding any edge from @xmath18 increases the number of copies of @xmath15 .",
    "a graph is @xmath17-saturated if and only if it is @xmath17-semi - saturated and @xmath15-free .",
    "we define :    @xmath26    the most frequently studied host graph is the complete graph , @xmath21 .",
    "since work in the area began with erds , hajnal and moon @xcite , many others have studied @xmath27 and @xmath28 : see for instance the survey articles of pikhurko @xcite and of j. faudree , r. faudree and schmitt @xcite and the references contained therein . in the literature , @xmath28 is often written as @xmath29 and @xmath30-saturated is usually written as @xmath15-saturated .",
    "since the results in this paper concern a different host graph , we will reserve this latter abbreviation for a different meaning .",
    "a much studied variant of the turn problem was initiated by erds in @xcite and expanded upon by alon , krech and szab @xcite . for a fixed graph @xmath15 , they ask for @xmath31 , the maximum number of edges in an @xmath15-free subgraph of the @xmath3-dimensional hypercube , @xmath4 .",
    "the most natural case is @xmath32 , a fixed cube .",
    "this is wide open , even for the case @xmath9 . the asymptotic edge density of a maximum @xmath33-free graph , i.e. @xmath34 was conjectured by erds @xcite to be @xmath35 .",
    "it is still unknown , despite the attention of many authors ",
    "see for instance the work of balogh , hu , lidick and liu @xcite and of brass , harborth and nienborg @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the saturation and semi - saturation problems , where the host graph is the hypercube and the forbidden graph is a subcube .",
    "that is , we study @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for brevity , we shall often write @xmath15-saturated ( resp . @xmath15-semi - saturated ) rather than @xmath38-saturated ( resp .",
    "@xmath38-semi - saturated ) in the remainder of this paper , when the value of @xmath3 is clear or irrelevant .",
    "the best result along these lines is that of choi and guan @xcite :    @xmath39    a conjecture that this is best possible , due to santolupo , was reported in @xcite .",
    "the same survey article posed the more general question of determining @xmath5 .",
    "the main result of this paper , in section [ zero density ] , is the construction , for all fixed @xmath8 , of @xmath1-saturated graphs of arbitrarily low edge density , thus both generalizing and improving the bound of choi and guan . in other words ,",
    "we show :    [ generalupper ] for fixed @xmath8 ,    @xmath40    slightly more precisely , we show @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants depending on @xmath8 . in the case",

    "[ q2upper ] for all @xmath3 , @xmath47 .",
    "it is easy to see that both these theorems are best possible up to a constant factor , as all @xmath48-semi - saturated graphs have minimum degree @xmath49 .    in section [ lowerbounds ]",
    ", we will improve this trivial lower bound , by showing that    @xmath50    in section [ discussion ] , we discuss an extension to our zero density upper bound and raise some open questions .",
    "we briefly mention here a somewhat related saturation problem on the cube . here , @xmath4 is considered as @xmath51 , the power set of an @xmath3 element set , @xmath52 . let @xmath15 be a fixed poset .",
    "a family @xmath53 is said to be @xmath15-saturated if there is no subfamily of @xmath54 with the same poset structure as @xmath15 , but adding any set to @xmath54 destroys this property .",
    "both the maximum and minimum size of such @xmath54 have been studied ",
    "see for instance katona and tarjn @xcite for the former and morrison , noel and scott @xcite for the latter .",
    "in this section , we introduce terminology , notation and concepts that will be used frequently in the remainder of this paper .    the hypercube @xmath4 is the graph with vertex set @xmath55 , and with edges between each pair of vertices that differ in exactly one coordinate .",
    "alternatively , the vertex set may be considered as @xmath56 , the @xmath3-dimensional vector space over the field with 2 elements .",
    "we write @xmath57 for the canonical basis of @xmath56 ( @xmath58 is the vector with a 1 in the @xmath59 coordinate , and 0 s elsewhere ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath60 is adjacent to @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 , for some @xmath63 .    a subcube of @xmath4 is an induced subgraph isomorphic to @xmath2 , for some @xmath64 .",
    "a set of vertices , @xmath65 , is a the vertex set of a subcube if and only if there is some set of coordinates @xmath66=\\{1,2,3, ... ,n\\}$ ] , and constants @xmath67 for each @xmath68 such that @xmath69 @xmath65 if and only if for all @xmath68 , @xmath70 .",
    "_ fixed coordinates _ are those coordinates in @xmath71 , whereas _",
    "free coordinates _ are coordinates that are not fixed .",
    "we can thus represent a subcube as an element of @xmath72 , with stars in the free coordinates , and @xmath73 in the fixed coordinates . as edges can be thought of as @xmath74 s",
    ", we may represent edges as elements of @xmath72 in this way .",
    "we will say an edge or subcube lies _ along _",
    "the directions @xmath75 if these contain all the free coordinates of the edge or subcube .",
    "the _ weight _ of @xmath76 is the number of coordinates of @xmath60 that are 1 .",
    "we may write @xmath77 as @xmath78 , the graph cartesian product of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , @xmath77 is formed by replacing each vertex of @xmath80 with a copy of @xmath79 .",
    "we call these _",
    "principle @xmath79s_. where there was a @xmath80 edge , @xmath81 , we instead put edges between corresponding vertices of the principle @xmath79 s placed at the endpoints of @xmath81 .",
    "so we have two types of edges : _ internal edges _ which have both endpoints in the same principle @xmath79 and _ external edges _ which have endpoints in different principle @xmath79 s .",
    "notice that there are @xmath82 directions along which internal edges lie , and @xmath83 directions along which external edges lie .",
    "this view of @xmath77 is crucial in the proof of theorem [ generalupper ] ; we will write @xmath77 as @xmath78 when we wish to use this viewpoint .",
    "another way of encapsulating the product nature of @xmath4 is to write a vertex @xmath84 as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "two vertices @xmath85 and @xmath88 are adjacent if and only if there is a @xmath89 such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are adjacent as vertices of @xmath92 and for all @xmath93 .",
    "we will use this notation heavily in section 4 .",
    "an object we shall use in several of our constructions is the _ hamming code_. the properties of hamming codes that we require are listed below , but see van lint @xcite for more backgound . for our purposes , a hamming code , @xmath94 , can be thought of as a subset of @xmath95 , where @xmath96 for some @xmath97 , with the following properties :    1 .",

    "every vertex of @xmath4 is either in @xmath94 or adjacent to a vertex in @xmath94 .",

    "a subset @xmath94 with these properties exists only if @xmath96 ( and when it exists , it is the largest set with property 3 , and the smallest with property 4 ) . for other values of @xmath3 , we make do with an _ approximate hamming code_. this is any @xmath102 satisfying :    1 .",
    "@xmath94 is a linear subspace of @xmath56 .",

    "in this section , we shall prove a quantitative version of theorem [ generalupper ] , of which theorem [ generalupper ] is an immediate consequence .",
    "generalupper for all @xmath106 , there exist constants , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , for all @xmath112 .    before discussing the proof of theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113",
    ", we sketch a proof of the @xmath114 bound of choi and guan , as this contains the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113 .",
    "this proof is significantly different from choi and guan s , which may be considered more direct .",
    "however , our approach , which uses @xmath115 density saturated graphs to build @xmath116 density saturated graphs , naturally gives rise to an iterative approach for proving theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113 .",
    "we assume that there exist three @xmath117-saturated graphs , @xmath118 and @xmath119 of @xmath115 density , such that every edge of @xmath4 lies in one of them .",
    "we will use these to produce a @xmath116 density @xmath120-saturated graph @xmath121 .",
    "these @xmath122 are relatively easy to construct  we will require a generalization of them in our proof of theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113 .",
    "we first construct an ` almost ' @xmath120-saturated graph @xmath123 .",
    "we consider @xmath124 as @xmath125 .",
    "we leave two principle @xmath4 s corresponding to antipodal vertices of @xmath126 empty . around each of these empty @xmath4",
    ", we arrange copies of @xmath127 , as in the figure below .",
    "we also add all external edges with one endpoint in either of the two empty principle @xmath4 s ( as indicated by the bold edges in the figure ) .    ]",
    "the graph constructed has the property that for any edge of an empty @xmath4 , @xmath81 , the corresponding edge , @xmath128 is present in one of the @xmath122 .",
    "so adding @xmath81 forms a @xmath33 comprising @xmath81 , @xmath128 and the two external edges that connect corresponding endpoints of @xmath81 and @xmath128 . since the @xmath122 are themselves @xmath33-saturated graphs , adding any internal edge forms a copy of @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath123 is still @xmath33-free , and a quick calculation shows that @xmath123 has edge density @xmath116 .",
    "we now prove a simple lemma that allows us to extend @xmath123 to a @xmath33-saturated graph .",
    "[ greedylemma ] fix @xmath129 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a @xmath2-free subgraph of @xmath4 and @xmath130 .",
    "then we can form a @xmath2-free graph @xmath131 by adding no more than @xmath132 edges to @xmath0 with the property that adding any edge in @xmath133 forms a copy of @xmath2 .",
    "we order the edges of @xmath65 arbitrarily .",
    "consider these edges in this order and add them to @xmath0 if and only if doing so does not form a copy of @xmath2 .",
    "since only edges of @xmath65 are added by the process , we are done .    applying this lemma to @xmath123 , with @xmath65 being the set of external edges , forms a @xmath33-saturated graph , @xmath121 .",
    "since there are @xmath134 external edges , the asymptotic edge density is still @xmath10 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113 uses a similar method multiple times to produce @xmath1-saturated graphs of arbitrarily low density . in the case",
    "where @xmath9 , we assume that we have a collection of @xmath33-saturated graphs , @xmath135 , of edge density at most @xmath136 , such that every edge of @xmath4 is contained in at least one of the @xmath122 .",
    "we will view @xmath137 as @xmath138 and leave several principle @xmath4 empty .",
    "we shall ensure that each empty @xmath4 is adjacent , for every @xmath139 , to a principle @xmath4 filled with @xmath122 , and add every external edge leaving these empty @xmath4 .",
    "this ensures that adding an edge within the empty @xmath4 forms a copy of @xmath33 .",
    "the constraint on the empty principle @xmath4 is that the set of vertices that we replace with empty @xmath4 s must have minimum distance 3 , and so we employ a hamming code , enabling us to produce a graph with a lower density , @xmath140 .",
    "of course , to apply this method again , we need several @xmath141-saturated graphs of density @xmath140 , which between them cover the edges of @xmath137 .",
    "this turns out to be not much harder , using cosets of the hamming code .",
    "in the general @xmath8 case we adapt this method .",
    "we would like to use a collection of @xmath122 that cover all the copies of @xmath142 in @xmath4 .",
    "such a collection seems hard to construct , but a modification of the argument shows that it suffices to cover almost all copies of @xmath142 .",
    "the other modification is that instead of using empty principle @xmath4 , we fill them with low density @xmath142-saturated graphs , which we may assume exist by induction on @xmath8 .",
    "we proceed by an induction on @xmath8 , wherein the inductive step uses the ` density increment ' argument sketched above .",
    "* base case : * m=1 .",
    "this is trivial ",
    "the subgraph of @xmath4 with no edges is @xmath74-saturated .",
    "* inductive step : * take @xmath112 and assume the theorem holds for @xmath49 .    [ increment ] suppose we have a collection , @xmath143 , of @xmath1-saturated graphs , each of density at most @xmath136 , and some @xmath144 such that every @xmath142 lies along the first @xmath144 directions is within one of these @xmath122 .",
    "then there is a collection of @xmath145 @xmath141-saturated graphs , @xmath146 , such that every @xmath142 that lies along the first @xmath144 directions is in one of these @xmath147 .",
    "further , each of the @xmath147 has density at most @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is a function that tends to zero whenever @xmath3 , @xmath150 in such a way that @xmath151 .",
    "a precise upper bound on the densities of the @xmath147 is required for the quantitative part of the theorem ; this will be stated at the end of the proof of this claim .",
    "we start by constructing a @xmath145 colouring , @xmath152 , of @xmath153 , with the colours @xmath154 .",
    "fix @xmath155 , an approximate hamming code in @xmath153 .",
    "we set @xmath156 for all @xmath157 and for all @xmath158 and all @xmath159 , we set @xmath160 .",
    "note that when @xmath145 is not a power of 2 ( i.e. when we do not have a genuine hamming code ) , this colouring is not fully defined , since @xmath94 is not dominating .",
    "for now we assign arbitrary colours other than 0 to these vertices , but we will later decide on these colours .",
    "we write @xmath161 .",
    "we induce from @xmath152 a colouring on the set of principle @xmath4 s in the natural way .",
    "we start forming the graph @xmath162 by placing a copy of @xmath163 in each principle @xmath4 coloured @xmath89 , for each @xmath164 . also , we add to the graph @xmath162 every external edge with one endpoint in a principle @xmath4 coloured 0 .    by our induction hypothesis ,",
    "there exists a @xmath142-saturated subgraph , @xmath0 , of @xmath4 with no more than @xmath165 edges .",
    "we place a graph isomorphic to @xmath0 in each @xmath4 that is coloured 0 ( we will choose which isomorphism later ) .",
    "notice that so far , @xmath162 is @xmath2-free . indeed , suppose that @xmath162 does contain a @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2 can not lie entirely within a single principle @xmath4 , by our assumption that the @xmath122 are saturated .",
    "as we have only added external edges that leave @xmath4 coloured 0 , the @xmath2 may contain an edge between two principle @xmath4 s only if one of them is coloured @xmath166 .",
    "since the hamming code has minimum distance 3 , the @xmath2 must contain edges in exactly two principle @xmath4 s , one of which is coloured @xmath166 .",
    "but such @xmath4 are @xmath142-saturated and thus contain no @xmath142 , yielding a contradiction .",
    "so far , @xmath162 is not quite @xmath2-saturated  for instance adding an external edge may not create a copy of @xmath2 .",
    "however , we use lemma [ greedylemma ] to remedy this .",
    "we add at most @xmath167 edges to @xmath162 and we now only need to consider adding internal edges .    adding an edge within a @xmath4 coloured @xmath164 forms a @xmath2 , as each @xmath163 is @xmath2-saturated . adding an edge within a principle @xmath4 coloured 0 will form a @xmath142 within that @xmath4 . if that @xmath142 only uses edges in the first @xmath144 directions , it lies within one of the @xmath163 by the hypothesis of claim [ increment ] . since every principle @xmath4 coloured zero is adjacent to a principle @xmath4 of every non - zero colour , a @xmath2 will be formed .",
    "therefore , we only need to worry about adding edges to @xmath0 if the @xmath142 formed does not lie exclusively along the first @xmath144 directions  we call such edges _ bad edges_. we will now show that we may assume there are not very many bad edges .",
    "apply a random automorphism of @xmath4 to @xmath0 , our low density @xmath142-saturated graph .",
    "we call the graph formed @xmath168 , which is to be placed within a principle @xmath169 coloured 0 .",
    "let @xmath81 be a fixed edge of this principle @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath170    this tells us that the expected number of bad edges , in each principle @xmath4 coloured 0 , is no more than @xmath171 .",
    "we now choose the automorphism of @xmath0 that we left unspecified earlier ; we can do this such that we get no more bad edges than the expected number .",
    "we use lemma [ greedylemma ] , with @xmath65 being the set of bad edges , to form a graph that we also call @xmath162 that is @xmath2-saturated .",
    "we now construct the other @xmath147 to cover the required @xmath142 s .",
    "to construct @xmath147 , we repeat the same method used for constructing @xmath162 , except we use @xmath172 instead of @xmath155 .",
    "note that we can make the arbitrary choices of colours to ensure each principle @xmath4 is filled with each of the graphs @xmath135 , in one of the @xmath147 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath147 satisfy the necessary @xmath142 condition .",
    "indeed any @xmath173 along the first @xmath144 directions must lie within a principle @xmath4 . when considered as a subgraph of this @xmath4",
    ", it must lie in a copy of one of the @xmath122say @xmath163 .",
    "this principle @xmath4 is filled with @xmath163 in one of the @xmath147 , so we are done .",
    "it remains only to bound the number of edges in each saturated subgraph , @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath174 and @xmath175.in the calculation that follow , we write @xmath176 and @xmath177 for brevity .",
    "recall that edges were added to each @xmath178 in 4 ways : from copies of @xmath122 , from adding external edges , from the @xmath142-saturated graphs and from adding bad edges .",
    "@xmath179    clearly if @xmath144 is large enough , and @xmath180 , the last two terms can be arbitrarily small , thus concluding the proof of the claim .",
    "we first find a collection of subgraphs , @xmath181 , of @xmath182 that satisfy the hypothesis of claim [ increment ] , with @xmath183 . to do this , let @xmath122 initially consist of all edges whose lowest weight endpoint has weight in @xmath184 , and then extend greedily until @xmath122 is @xmath2 saturated .",
    "each @xmath122 contains every @xmath142 whose lowest weight vertex has weight @xmath185 , so every @xmath142 is contained in one of these @xmath122 .",
    "trivially , we may bound the density of these @xmath122 above by 1 , and it is easy to see this is best possible up to a constant .",
    "we now apply claim [ increment ] repeatedly , @xmath186 times .",
    "we write @xmath187 and @xmath188 for the value of @xmath189 and @xmath3 after the @xmath190 iterate .",
    "clearly , @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "after @xmath186 steps , we end with saturated graphs of density , @xmath136 :    @xmath193    here , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are constants dependent on @xmath8 . if @xmath9 it is optimal to take @xmath196 , otherwise @xmath197 , it is optimal to take @xmath198    this gives the required bound .",
    "note that the better bound for @xmath14 in the next section can be fed into the induction in the theorem to produce the slightly better bound of @xmath199 .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem [ semisatupper ] , by constructing for each @xmath8 a family of @xmath2-semi - saturated graphs with bounded average degree .",
    "although it seems difficult in general to make these graphs @xmath2-free , in the @xmath9 case we will use similar ideas to prove theorem [ q2upper ] .    in",

    "these vertices form a subcube of @xmath4 and all but the endpoints of @xmath81 are in @xmath210 .",
    "thus when the edge @xmath81 is added , a copy of @xmath2 is formed , concluding our proof .    clearly , when @xmath226 for some @xmath186 , we get the slightly stronger bound @xmath227 .      in the @xmath9 case , the @xmath33-semi - saturated graph constructed above consists of all edges incident with vertices in @xmath228 .",

    "just this alteration means the graph is no longer semi - saturated ; we get around this by picking a subset @xmath237 of @xmath238 with similar properties to @xmath94 , and adding edges starting at @xmath239 if @xmath240 contains an odd number of 1 s and if @xmath241 .    similarly to before , we write @xmath242 , where @xmath243 , and let @xmath202 .",
    "we write an element , @xmath60 , of @xmath72 as @xmath244 , where @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",

    "further , @xmath16 only contains edges incident with @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "we shall prove this claim later , first we show why it implies the theorem .",
    "we start by constructing a graph @xmath0 that is @xmath33-free and will then use lemma [ greedylemma ] add a ` few ' edges ( @xmath254 edges ) to form @xmath131 , a @xmath33-saturated graph . as in the proof of theorem [ semisatupper ] , we will define a subset , @xmath210 of the vertices , which will be dominating in @xmath0 :    @xmath255 the definition of @xmath0 is slightly more complicated .",
    "we add edges to @xmath209 in three stages , and then delete some of these edges to ensure @xmath0 is @xmath33-free .",
    "firstly , we add all edges , @xmath81 , where @xmath256 , and the remainder , @xmath257 , contains an even number of 1 s and a single star , as well as edges where @xmath258 and the remainder , @xmath259 contains an even number of 1 s and a single star .",

    "all @xmath4-edges with exactly one endpoint in @xmath210 are edges of @xmath0 , so we only need to consider edges where one endpoint , @xmath268 , has @xmath236 and @xmath293 .",

    ", it is an independent , dominating set and @xmath308 .",
    "we write @xmath309 ; in other words , @xmath310 .",
    "let @xmath311 .",
    "it is easy to see every edge of @xmath16 is incident with @xmath252 . since the @xmath312 are disjoint translates of @xmath94 , a hamming code , @xmath251 .    again using that @xmath313 is a translate of a hamming code ,",
    "every @xmath314 can be written uniquely in the form @xmath315 for @xmath231 and @xmath316 $ ] .",
    "the restriction @xmath317 is equivalent to @xmath318 .",
    "the restriction @xmath319 is equivalent to @xmath320 .",
    "this is as @xmath321 .",
    "similarly , @xmath322 if and only if @xmath323 . thus steps 2 , 3 and 4 ensure @xmath237 is independent and dominating in @xmath16 .    notice also that each @xmath324 is @xmath16-adjacent to exactly 1 element in @xmath237 .",
    "hence @xmath325 , as required .",
    "it remains only to show that @xmath16 is @xmath33-free .",
    "suppose not .",
    "since we have only added edges with at least one endpoint in @xmath252 , the @xmath33 must contain two opposite vertices in @xmath252 . since @xmath94 has minimum distance 3 , and since every @xmath324 is adjacent to only 1 element in @xmath237 , one of these vertices is in @xmath237 , and one is in @xmath94 .",
    "thus the vertices of the @xmath33 may be written in the form @xmath326 and @xmath327 , where @xmath328 $ ] are such that @xmath329 , and @xmath330 .",
    "but it is impossible for all the edges of this @xmath33 to lie in @xmath331 .",
    "indded , suppose for example that @xmath322 .",
    "then @xmath219 and @xmath90 must both have 1 in the first coordinate and 1 in the second coordinate , impossible if they sum to @xmath304 .",
    "this concludes the proof of the claim .",
    "again , we get a stronger bound for some values of @xmath3 ; when @xmath332 for some @xmath186 , it is easy to see that @xmath333 .",
    "all the lower bounds in this section are for @xmath334 ; easily @xmath335 , so the bounds are also valid for @xmath336 .",
    "if a graph is @xmath48-semi - saturated , for @xmath129 , it must be connected .",
    "thus it contains a spanning tree for @xmath4 and so @xmath337 .",
    "this shows that theorems [ semisatupper ] and [ q2upper ] are best possible up to a constant factor .",
    "another trivial observation improves this for @xmath338 : if a graph is @xmath48-semi - saturated , it has minimum degree @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath339 .",
    "we do better than both trivial bounds for all @xmath8    if @xmath129 , @xmath340    let @xmath0 be a @xmath341-semi - saturated graph with minimum degree @xmath49 ; note this contains all @xmath48-semi - saturated graphs .",
    "we call a pair @xmath342 , where @xmath343 , _ good _ if there is a path of length 3 in @xmath0 linking the endpoints of @xmath81 , that passes through @xmath84 , meaning @xmath84 is not a start or end vertex of the path .    note that every non - edge of @xmath0 is in at least 2 good pairs , whereas each vertex @xmath84 is in at most @xmath344 good pairs .    therefore @xmath345    subject to fixed @xmath346 , the left hand side is maximized when the degrees are as different as possible . but no degree can be larger than @xmath3 or smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath347 , so we have @xmath348 vertices of degree @xmath3 in this extreme case .",
    "so certainly @xmath349",
    "having seen that @xmath350 , it is natural to ask for a more precise bound  while in section 4 we have determined @xmath5 up to a constant , for @xmath9 , there is still a wide gap between the best upper and lower bounds for general @xmath8 . in particular , we do not know whether families of @xmath2-saturated graphs of bounded average degree exist for all @xmath8 .      in section 4",
    ", we were able to produce better bounds on @xmath352 than @xmath353 .",
    "further , the construction we had for @xmath334 contained many copies of @xmath33 .",
    "this small amount of evidence may suggest that in general , the two are different , even asymptotically .        another version of @xmath336 that has been studied in the literature ( see section 10 of @xcite ) ( where the host graph is @xmath21 ) could be studied for this problem .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath356 is _ @xmath1-weakly - saturated _ if we can add the edges in @xmath287 one at a time ( in some order ) such that every new edge creates at least one new copy of @xmath15 .",
    "we write @xmath357-@xmath5 for the minimum number of edges a @xmath48-weakly saturated graph can have .",
    "clearly , @xmath357-@xmath358 .",
    "it is not hard to see , by induction on @xmath3 , that there are many weakly @xmath117-saturated trees and so @xmath359 .",
    "indeed , given any @xmath360 , possibly different weakly @xmath361-saturated trees , we place them in complementary @xmath362 s , and connect any one pair of corresponding vertices .",

    "we say that a subhypergraph @xmath16 of @xmath365 is @xmath367-free if it contains no subhypergraph isomorphic to @xmath368 . as in the usual ( @xmath369 ) case of this turn problem",
    ", they ask how many edges @xmath16 can have- in particular asking for the limit : @xmath370 .",
    "this question is still open , but it is interesting to know that the corresponding saturation problem can be attacked by the same method as the proof of theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113 .    let @xmath16 be a subhypergraph of @xmath365 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is @xmath371-saturated if @xmath0 is @xmath367-free but adding another @xmath366-edge to @xmath0 forms a subhypergraph isomorphic to @xmath367 .",

    "we write @xmath372 for the smallest number of edges a @xmath371-saturated @xmath16 can have .",
    "we can show by the same method as the proof of theorem [ generalupper]@xmath113 that , for @xmath373 and @xmath374 , @xmath375    as in the proof of theorem [ generalupper] we proceed by induction on @xmath273 with the @xmath282 case being trivial .",
