    "we prove the existence of a global minimizer for @xmath7 , in the class of finite systems of axisymmetric surfaces , under the constraints that the total area and the total enclosed volume of the surfaces are fixed .",
    "biological membranes and their shapes have attracted attention from researchers across many areas of mathematics .",
    "for example , membranes connect classical problems of differential geometry involving willmore s functional to studies of shape configurations of biological cells in physics and biology ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , researchers in both mathematical analysis and scientific computing have directed efforts to understanding _ multiphase _ membranes , where phase transitions and pattern formation can be observed ( see , e.g.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the modeling of multiphase membranes has numerous applications associated with artificial membranes in pharmacology and bioengineering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in his seminal work @xcite ,",
    "canham proposed the functional , in the case @xmath8 , in order to model the elastic bending energy of biological membranes formed by a double layer of phospholipids . when immersed in water ,",
    "these molecules , which are composed by a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail , spontaneously aggregate in order to shield the tails from water , forming a closed bilayer with the heads pointing outwards .",
    "since the thickness of a layer is generally three to four orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the observed cells or vesicles , the bilayer is usually approximated as a two - dimensional surface @xmath0 embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the functional @xmath7 is the most general example of energy which is quadratic in the principal curvatures .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 , added by helfrich @xcite , accounts for an asymmetry in the composition of the layers and gives rise to a spontaneous curvature of the membrane in absence of other constraints .",
    "the bending rigidities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also material - dependent parameters . under the simplifying assumption that the membrane is homogeneous , we choose @xmath11 and @xmath10 constant . in reality , phases with different levels of aggregation and different rigidities are observed @xcite .",
    "there are two natural constraints associated with the membrane configuration .",
    "since lipid membranes are inextensible , the total area of the membrane should be fixed . on the other hand ,",
    "the membrane is permeable to water but not to dissolved ions .",
    "the resulting osmotic pressure leads then to a constraint on the volume enclosed by the membrane , which can therefore be regarded as constant @xcite . from the point of view of our analysis , the constraint on the area plays a crucial role in obtaining a priori bounds and compactness .",
    "the constraint on the volume , instead , does not add any property or difficulty , but it is the combination of these two constraints that makes highly nontrivial the problem of determining the minimizer .",
    "another important feature of membranes is that they can undergo topological changes , for example , a spherical vesicle can shrink at the equator and eventually split into two vesicles ( fission ) or a small dome can rise from a point of the surface and grow into a new entity which separates from the original one ( budding ) , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.9 ) and @xcite . in order to be able to describe these kind of phenomena",
    ", we do not impose restrictions on the number of components of the minimizers .",
    "helfrich s functional can be regarded as a generalization of the classical willmore functional , defined by @xmath12 in the seminal paper @xcite , leon simon proved that for each @xmath13 there exists a compact embedded real analytic torus in @xmath14 which minimizes @xmath15 among compact embedded surfaces of genus 1 . following the direct method of the calculus of variations",
    ", he first shows that sequences of minimizers are compact in the sense of measures , and then proves that the limit measure is actually an analytic surface .",
    "simon s proof of regularity relies on the invariance of willmore functional under conformal transformations and on the fact that a minimizing surface @xmath0 must satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "owing to the presence of the spontaneous curvature @xmath17 and to the combined area and volume constraints , helfrich s functional _ is not conformally invariant _ , and for general values of area and volume , we only know that @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , though measure - compactness can be easily transferred to our case , simon s method for regularity can not be employed , and we have to find a different approach .",
    "regarding minimization with area and volume constraints in the case @xmath8 , existence of genus 0 minimizers with fixed isoperimetric ratio was recently proved in @xcite , while @xcite gives a complete classification of smooth critical points with low energy .",
    "existence of minimizers for functionals with weak second fundamental form in @xmath19 was addressed also in @xcite , using the theory of varifolds ( see also the end of section [ ssec : discussion ] ) . however , in contrast to the mean curvature vector , the scalar mean curvature @xmath3 does not have a variational characterization and there is no definition of scalar mean curvature for an arbitrary integral varifold .",
    "this obstacle can be removed using the generalized gauss graphs introduced in @xcite and developed in @xcite .",
    "compactness and lower - semicontinuity properties allow to obtain a minimizer , but it is not trivial to understand whether the limit , which in general is only a rectifiable current , is actually a classical surface .",
    "this is certainly true in the case of one - dimensional curves in @xmath20 , see for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but the question remains open for surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "a different approach , based on a new formulation for the euler - lagrange equation of willmore functional , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "one of the results therein is a new proof of the existence of minimizers . in the attempt to apply this new method to helfrich functional ,",
    "the same difficulties as above appear , in particular , the lack of an equivalent of li - yau minimality condition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6 ) for helfrich functional necessitates another approach in order to guarantee that minimizers are embedded .",
    "regarding the existence of minimizers for the constrained willmore functional , in @xcite it is proven existence and regularity of axisymmetric solutions of the euler - lagrange equations with symmetric boundary conditions . in @xcite , adopting the techniques introduced in @xcite , the author proves the existence of minimizers with prescribed isoperimetric ratio .",
    "we are not aware of any extension of these methods to the constrained helfrich functional .    in the present work ,",
    "we give an answer that is only partial , since we restrict to axisymmetric surfaces .",
    "we note that our result can not be obtained from the above - mentioned results for @xmath21-regular curves , since if a curve @xmath22 generates a surface with bounded helfrich energy @xmath7 , it is not true in general that @xmath22 is @xmath21-regular ( see section [ ssec : discussion ] below ) .",
    "the class of axisymmetric surfaces is probably the most interesting from the point of view of applications .",
    "in fact seifert ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1.4 ) ) notes that  it turns out that in large regions of the interesting parameter space the shape of lowest energy is indeed axisymmetric for vesicles of spherical topology \" .",
    "we actually conjecture that _ for any given area and volume satisfying the isoperimetric inequality , and for any constant spontaneous curvature , the problem of minimizing in the class of embedded , constrained surfaces has a solution , and it is axisymmetric_.    after this work was completed , we became aware of the preprint @xcite , which studies the @xmath23-limit of a diffuse - interface approximation of helfrich s functional for two - phase axisymmetric surfaces , and where many of the same technical difficulties that we encounter are addressed .",

    "the crucial ingredients , which are not prescribed by the general direct method and have to be chosen for each specific problem , are the set of minimizers , which we discuss at the beginning of section [ sec : existence ] , and the topology with respect to which compactness and lower - semicontinuity must be verified . regarding the topology ,",
