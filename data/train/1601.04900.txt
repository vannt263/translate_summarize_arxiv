    "for a gas of point - like particles off resonantly illuminated by coherent light , the individual dipoles oscillate in phase , each emitting radiation in a characteristic pattern .",
    "when several particles contribute to the scattering , the corresponding amplitudes interfere , which leads to a strongly angle - dependent scattering distribution  @xcite . in addition , if the motional degree of freedom is relevant on the considered time scales , any high field seeking particle will be drawn towards the corresponding local light field maxima , where in turn light scattering is enhanced .",
    "this directional energy and momentum transfer between the gas and the field leads to an instability resulting in density fluctuations and potentially also in the formation of an ordered pattern . while for a room temperature gas",
    "this typically occurs only at very high pump powers  @xcite , it can become important for very strong scatterers as larger nano- or microparticles  @xcite .",
    "the stringent threshold conditions can be relaxed by laser cooling the gas to temperatures well below the @xmath0-range as well as by recycling the scattered light in optical resonators . in this case",
    "much weaker forces and thus lower light power is needed to a create substantial back - action effect of the scattered light onto the particles .",
    "this back - action was predicted to lead to roton - like instabilities and spatial bunching even at moderate pump powers , as observed in several configurations  @xcite .",
    "a relevant question is thus whether these instabilities can in some cases lead to the formation of a stable crystalline phase in the steady state of such driven , dissipative systems .",
    "the first and simplest instance of such crystals is the self - ordered phase of transversally driven atoms in optical resonators  @xcite , with the corresponding transition observable also as a quantum phase transition at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently that a similar phase is also realizable in longitudinally pumped ring - cavities  @xcite .    while this self - ordered phase shows some aspects shared by standard crystals like a roton - like mode  @xcite , other characteristic features like the breaking of a continuous translational symmetry and a crystal spacing",
    "which is not externally fixed are both missing , since the resonator mirrors select a single electromagnetic mode . in order to include such features one necessarily needs to couple the particles to several electromagnetic modes , ideally a continuum .",
    "this is the case in one - dimensional tapered optical nanofibers  @xcite or confocal cavities  @xcite , where transversally driven atoms are predicted to spontaneously break the continuous symmetry into a crystal phase .",
    "the existence of a continuum of electromagnetic modes opens up the possibility for photons to crystallize , as it was studied with light propagating under electromagnetically - induced - transparency conditions through a nonlinear medium @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose and characterise a novel crystalline phase of light and ultracold atoms .",
    "we consider a mirror symmetric and translation invariant setup as it is depicted in  [ fig : model ] .",
    "it involves an elongated bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) longitudinally illuminated by two counter propagating gaussian beams far detuned from any atomic resonance .",
    "the beams have either orthogonal polarization or a sufficiently large frequency difference to suppress any interference effects . above a finite driving intensity",
    "both atoms and light break a continuous translational symmetry leading to pattern formation with an intrinsically defined lattice spacing determined by the polarizability and density of the gas .",
    "the resulting state corresponds to a supersolid bec trapped in an emerging optical lattice , the latter showing collective phononic excitations .",
    "the appearance of an emergent length scale in combination with lattice phonons - i.e. the appearance of a crystal of light - is a crucial difference to configurations where the drive is transverse to the direction in which the system organises  @xcite .",
    "a useful property of the chosen geometry is that ample information about the coupled system dynamics can be retrieved from the reflected light fields in a completely non - invasive manner .",
    "the present study opens a new direction in ( ultra)cold atom - lattice physics , naturally including long range phonon - type interactions and real - time non - destructive monitoring .",
    "we consider a trapped atomic bec interacting with the electromagnetic ( em ) field driven by two far off - resonant , counterpropagating , orthogonally polarized laser beams , as depicted in  [ fig : model ] . in the dispersive regime",
    "considered below , the em field provides an optical potential for the bec ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gpe ] ) ) , while the bec significantly modifies the refractive index ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : helmh_total ] ) ) , thus both field and matter are dynamical quantities .",
    "the bec is treated within the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field approximation @xcite , whereby the condensate wave function satisfies the equation @xmath1\\psi(x , t)\\\\ + \\frac{g_cn}{a}|\\psi(x , t)|^2\\psi(x , t ) , \\label{eqn : gpe}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes the particle s mass , @xmath3 is the effective s - wave atom - atom interaction strength , and @xmath4 is the atom number . for computational simplicity",
    "we assume the bec to be confined by an extra transverse trapping potential @xmath5 such that the dynamics along the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axis is negligible .",
    "therefore , the bec wave function @xmath8 is assumed to be in the ground state of the transverse trap with characteristic size @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the bec cross section .",
    "such a quasi one - dimensional treatment is eligible if the bec s chemical potential @xmath11 is much smaller than the characteristic transverse trap frequency : @xmath12 .",
    "the wavefunction satisfies the normalization condition : @xmath13 .",
    "the total optical potential for the bec has two contributions : @xmath14 representing the _ static _ trapping potential @xmath15 and the longitudinal ( along x ) optical potential @xmath16 determined by the _ dynamical _ part of the injected and scattered em field ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the latter consists of two far off - resonant fields with orthogonal polarizations driven from the left ( l ) and right ( r ) side of the bec as depicted in  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the two polarization components of the field satisfy the helmholtz eq .",
    "the atoms inside the bec are described as linearly polarizable particles with a scalar polarizability @xmath17 where the imaginary part is negligibly small , i.e.  spontaneous emission of the atoms is neglected .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that the driving laser frequency @xmath18 is sufficiently far detuned form any atomic resonance to prevent substantial internal excitation .",
    "this avoids spontaneous emission and thus mixing of the two counterpropagating em components via raman scattering as it is used for near resonant polarization gradient cooling may be neglected .    while for spin - polarized atoms the polarizability is field direction dependent in general , we assume the same polarizability for both polarizations orthogonal to the laser axis being the quantization axis .",
    "this corresponds to transitions from a spherically ( or at least cylindrically ) symmetric atomic ground - state .",
    "the impinging laser fields from left and right are approximated by plane waves so that we can write the em field components as @xmath19 with the orthogonality condition @xmath20 .",
    "as the light transit time through the sample is negligible compared to all other time scales , the propagation delay of the em field is adiabatically eliminated and the two field envelops ( @xmath21 for the field from left and @xmath22 for the field from right ) satisfy the helmholtz equations @xmath23 with the wavenumber @xmath24 of the incoming beams and the susceptibility @xmath25 of the bec .",
    "this susceptibility depends on the condensate s density and is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the solution of  .",
    "the directionality of the field propagation in the helmholtz equations   is defined by the boundary conditions , according to which the l - component has a finite imposed amplitude on the left end of the system and the r - component has such on the right end ( see also appendix [ app : numerics ] ) .",
    "as soon as one knows the spatial distribution of the electric fields , one can calculate the optical potential for the atoms via @xmath28 inserting the optical potential   into   leaves us with the set of three coupled differential equations :  the gp   and the two helmholtz  , describing the nonlinear dynamics of our system .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity resulting from the atom - light coupling is quantified by the dimensionless constant @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the three - dimensional density of the homogeneous bec with @xmath32 its characteristic extension along @xmath33 . due to the adiabatic approximation involved in the helmholtz equation , the em fields depend only parametrically on time through the dynamical refractive index set by the bec density .    due to the orthogonality of the two chosen polarizations",
    "there is no interference between the two counterpropagating components of the em fields .",
    "therefore , the optical potential   only depends on the absolute value squared of the fields .",
    "this important feature guarantees the translation invariance of the setup along the x direction nevertheless maintaining a mirror symmetric setup . indeed ,",
    "since we are driving with plane - wave lasers , as long as the bec density is homogeneous , the em fields @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : helmh_total ] ) are also plane waves , leading to a translation invariant optical potential  .",
    "this invariance with respect to continuous translations is spontaneously broken above a finite driving intensity , as discussed in section  [ sec : crys_thres ] . in the resulting crystalline phase ,",
    "the lattice constant is intrinsically established as it is discussed in section  [ sec : groundstate ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that no specific modes are selected and the fields can counterpropagate independently .",
    "as already mentioned above , due to the orthogonality of the polarizations of the two injected counter - propagating laser fields the particles do not feel any longitudinal optical forces .",
    "naively , one could thus expect the bec to remain unperturbed independently of the pump intensity . in this section",
    "we show that this is actually not the case , as above a particular threshold driving strength small density fluctuations lead to backscattering of light which in turn amplifies these fluctuations .",
    "this leads to an instability towards crystallization in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the latter can be described by considering the collective excitation spectrum of the system for a spatially homogeneous density distribution of the bec @xmath35 with the corresponding propagating field solution of eq .  .",
    "these are plane waves of the form @xmath36 , with the modified wavenumber @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a real number fixed by the driving strength .",
    "the spectrum is obtained by linearizing the coupled equations , with the ansatz @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here",

    "the above analytical expression   is very useful to understand some essential features of the atom - light interaction in the present setup and in particular the nature of the crystallisation transition .",
    "apart from the last term , we recognize the known form of the bogoliubov spectrum of interacting becs  @xcite , with the linear - in-@xmath48 behavior corresponding to phononic excitations at low @xmath48 .",
    "the last term on the other hand is the only one resulting from the atom - light interactions .",
    "the first thing to note is that its denominator vanishes at @xmath49 , which tells immediately that the modified wavenumber   sets the favoured momentum for the appearance of the instability .",
    "however , the vanishing of the denominator is compensated by the diverging bec length @xmath32 , at every finite atom number @xmath4 ( note that @xmath50 ) .",

    "this divergence is an artefact of our model in which the light - mediated atom - atom interaction is of infinite range since the em field is adiabatically adapting to the bec configuration .",
    "the inclusion of the dynamics of the em field ( retardation effects ) would introduce a finite range and thus eliminate the divergence in the energy .",

    "here we still describe the one - dimensional bec using the gp equation , which requires the atom density to be large enough to be in the mean - field regime  @xcite .",
    "the enforcement of unidirectional propagation of light is more demanding since an appreciable amount of diffraction out of the bec axis would be present inducing propagation also perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "apart from the use of hollow - core optical fibers around the bec  @xcite , one option available in many laboratories today is using a two - dimensional array of tubes with spacing comparable with the wavelength of the light .",
    "this arrangement would generically produce destructive interference between the transverse field components diffracted from different tubes , so that if the latter are long enough only the forward propagation along the tube axis would remain . in this configuration ,",
    "each tube will act equally while the field propagates inside a medium with a refractive index given by the sum of the contributions from each tube .",
    "indeed , since all tubes share the same backreflected field there is a natural synchronization of the different tube lattices .    in any experimental realization",
    "a trap to confine the bec along @xmath33 will also be present .",
    "in addition , the two laser intensities might differ to some extend due to experimental inaccuracies . as an exemplary case we study the crystallization as in section  [ sec : groundstate ] but add a harmonic trapping potential @xmath106 and chose different pump intensities @xmath107 .",
    "it can be seen from  [ fig : groundstate_trap ] that the qualitative features of the crystalline phase remain the same as in the homogeneous case .",
    "the only difference is the parabolic envelope for the density as well as for the light intensity distribution and the shift of the distribution towards the direction of the higher intensity .",
    "the threshold behaviour remains similar to the one presented in  [ fig : threshold ] with the only difference being an increase of the threshold intensity .",

    "the solid blue line depicts the sum of both intensities.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a useful feature of the considered configuration is that the crystallization process can be observed in real time by looking at the amount of reflected light , since the transmitted part of the counterpropagating beam can be separated from the reflected part having orthogonal polarization .    in order to choose the most suitable atomic transition , pump detuning and power , as well as bec parameters like density and extension , one must consider the following constraints : we need to have i ) a low enough critical driving strength ( [ eqn : icrit ] ) , which depends on the detuning @xmath112 and spontaneous emission @xmath113 through the real part of polarizability @xmath114 , reading @xmath115 and at the same time ii ) a low enough bec heating rate , which at the critical power reads @xmath116 with @xmath117 being the surface density of the medium with respect to the light propagation . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : icrit_experiment ] ) and ( [ eqn : heating ] ) one sees that the crystallisation is easier achieved before the bec is heated up if we increase the bec surface density @xmath118 .",
    "there is no favorable scaling neither with detuning @xmath112 nor with the linewidth @xmath113 , since both heating rate ( [ eqn : heating ] ) and critical power ( [ eqn : icrit_experiment ] ) scale with @xmath119 . for commonly employed transitions like the rb or cs d lines ,",
    "the required laser power is easily achieved , but the heating rate can become a problem at too low densities due to the required laser powers and detunings .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath120 atoms confined over a transverse cross section @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we estimate a required power @xmath123 with a heating rate @xmath124 for the rubidium @xmath125 nm line with a detuning @xmath126ghz as well as for the cesium @xmath127 line with a detuning @xmath128ghz .",
    "such a heating rate would still allow to observe the crystal fromation since , as we see in  [ fig : densint_realt ] , this process takes place on the inverse recoil time scale , which is of the order of ms .",
    "we predict that in suitable geometries roton instabilities originating from non - linear free space atom light interactions can be tailored to generate stationary crystalline states .",
    "they involve an optical lattice showing an emergent spacing and phononic excitations , trapping the atoms at the intensity maxima .    the required translation invariant , mirror symmetric geometry can be realized using two orthogonal polarization degrees of freedom or frequency shifted counterpropagating beams .",
    "we estimate that the dynamics studied in this work should be accessible in already existing experimental setups on large quasi-1d bose - einstein condensates . actually , in comparison with standard crossed beam dipole traps , one simply has to adapt and control the polarizations of the trapping lasers and choose suitable detunings .",
    "the ordering process should be easily observable not only by measuring the atomic distributions but directly by looking at the reflected light from the condensate .",
    "this non - destructive measurement allows for a real - time monitoring of the dynamics .",
    "our results open up an intriguing new direction in quantum simulations with ultracold atoms in optical lattices , where the latter are enriched by the presence of collective phononic excitations resulting from the spontaneous crystallisation of light . in this spirit , the application of our approach to two - dimensions and the inclusions of retardation effects as well as quantum fluctuations constitute the natural extension of this study .    we thank s. krmer for support in the numerical implementation and f. meinert and t. donner for helpful discussions on the experimental limitations and implementability of the system .",

    "let us now move on to the calculation of the collective excitation spectrum above threshold as it is presented in section  [ sec : crystal_excitations ] . in this case",
    "an analytical answer like the one presented in the previous section is not possible , since the translation - invariance is broken so that the matrices describing the linear system are not diagonal in momentum space .",
