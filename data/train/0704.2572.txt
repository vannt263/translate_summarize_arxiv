    "the study of groups acting on trees is a central subject in geometric group theory .",
    "the bass - serre theory establishes a dictionary between the geometric study of groups acting on trees and the algebraic study of amalgams and hnn extensions . a central topic of investigation is the fixed point property for groups acting on trees , introduced by j .-",
    "serre in his book as the property ( fa)@xcite . a fundamental result due to tits states that a group without a free subgroup on two generators which acts on a tree by automorphisms fixes either a vertex or a point on the boundary or permutes a pair of points on the boundary ; see @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath0 , and more generally , groups with kazdhan s property ( t ) , in particular lattices in higher rank lie groups have the property ( fa ) ( @xcite ) . a natural problem is to understand the structure of the class of ( fa)-groups ( the class of groups having the property ( fa ) ) .",
    "there is an algebraic characterization of enumerable ( fa)-groups , due to j .- p .",
    "( @xcite , theorem i.6.15 , page 81 ) .",
    "an enumerable group has the property ( fa ) if and only if it satisfies the following three conditions :    \\(i ) it is not an amalgam ,    \\(ii ) it is not indicable ( i.e. admits no epimorphism onto @xmath1 ) ,    \\(iii ) it is finitely generated .",
    "but even such a nice result does not clarify the structure of the class of ( fa)-groups , as the first of these properties is usually difficult to check .",
    "the class of ( fa)-groups contains the class of finite groups and is closed under quotients . as",
    "every infinite finitely generated group surjects onto a just - infinite group ( i.e. an infinite group with all proper quotients finite ) a natural problem is to describe just infinite ( fa)-groups .    in  @xcite the class ( jinf ) of just infinite groups",
    "is divided in three subclasses : the class ( b ) of branch groups , the class ( hjinf ) of finite extensions of finite powers of hereditary just infinite groups and the class ( s ) of finite extensions of finite powers of simple groups .",
    "for example , the group @xmath0 belongs to the class ( jinf ) ; all infinite finitely generated simple torsion groups constructed in  @xcite are ( fa)-groups and belong to the class ( s ) .",
    "a precise definition of a branch group is given in section 1 .",
    "roughly speaking a branch group is a group which acts faithfully and level transitively on a spherically homogeneous rooted tree , and for which the structure of the lattice of subnormal subgroups mimics the structure of the tree .",
    "branch groups may enjoy unusual properties . among them",
    "one can find finitely generated infinite torsion groups , groups of intermediate growth , amenable but not elementary amenable groups and other surprising objects .",
    "profinite branch groups are also related to galois theory and other topics in number theory @xcite .    in this article",
    "we discuss fixed point properties for actions of branch groups on gromov hyperbolic spaces , in particular on @xmath2-trees .",
    "one of the corollaries of theorem 3 is :    [ a ] let @xmath3 be a finitely generated branch group",
    ". then @xmath3 has serre s property ( fa ) if and only if it is not indicable and has no epimorphism onto @xmath4 .",
    "therefore a branch group can not be an amalgam unless it surjects onto @xmath4 .",
    "we say that a group is ( fl ) if it has no epimorphism onto @xmath1 or @xmath5 . a f.g .",
    "group is ( fl ) if and only if it fixes a point whenever it acts isometrically on a line .",
    "all proper quotients of branch groups are virtually abelian  @xcite",
    ". a quotient of a branch group may be infinite : the full automorphism group of the binary rooted tree is a branch group and its abelianization is the infinite cartesian product of copies of a group of order two .",
    "it is more difficult to construct examples of finitely generated branch groups with infinite quotients ( especially in the restricted setting of self - similar groups ) .",
    "the corresponding question was open since 1997 when the second author introduced the notion of a branch group .",
    "perhaps the main difficulty was psychological , as he ( and some other researches working in the area ) was sure that all finitely generated branch groups are just infinite .",
    "now we know that this is not correct and the second part of the paper ( section 3 ) is devoted to a construction of an example of an indicable finitely generated branch group ( thus providing an example of a finitely generated branch group without the property ( fa ) ) .",
    "this example is the first example of a finitely generated branch group defined by a finite automaton that is not just infinite .",
    "another example is related to hanoi towers group on 3 pegs @xmath6 ( introduced in  @xcite and independently in  @xcite ) .",
    "hanoi towers group @xmath6 is a 3-generated branch group  @xcite that has a subgroup of index 4 ( the apollonian group ) which is also a branch group and is indicable ( this is announced in@xcite ) .",
    "the group @xmath6 itself is not indicable ( it has finite abelianization ) , but it surjects onto @xmath4 , as was recently observed by zoran uni .",
    "thus @xmath6 is the first example of a finitely generated branch group defined by a finite automaton that surjects onto @xmath4 .",
    "the example presented in this paper is an elaboration of the 3-generated torsion 2-group @xmath7 firstly constructed in  @xcite and later studied in  @xcite and other papers ( see also the chapter viii of the book  @xcite and the article @xcite .",

    "an interesting question is to understand which virtually abelian group can be realized as a quotient of a finitely generated branch group .",
    "this question is closely related to the problem of characterization of finitely generated branch groups having the furstenberg - tychonoff fixed ray property ( ft )  @xcite ) ( existence of an invariant ray for actions on a convex cone with compact base ) .",

    "the property ( i ) , the existence of just infinite quotients for finitely generated infinite groups and the trichotomy from @xcite mentioned in the introduction make the problem of classification of finitely generated just infinite ( fa)-groups worthwhile .",
    "we are reduced to the classification of finitely generated ( fa)-groups in each of the classes ( b ) , ( hjinf ) and ( s ) .",
    "below we solve this problem , in a certain sense , for the class ( b ) .",

    "similarly , if @xmath3 surjects onto the infinite dihedral group @xmath18 , then it acts on the line via the obvious action of @xmath18 .",
