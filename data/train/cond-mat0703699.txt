    "once a conductor forms contact with an insulator , an energy barrier is formed between the two materials , which impedes the charge - carrier injection into the insulator .",
    "although this injection barrier in general sways charge transport through the conductor / insulator system , only the two limiting cases of very low or very high injection barriers are often considered .    for low injection barriers ,",
    "one expects the contact to be ohmic , meaning that the contact is able to supply more charges per unit time than the bulk of the insulator can support . in this case , a space - charge region is formed and the electric field at the interface vanishes @xcite . because excess charge - carriers dominate charge transport in insulators , one observes a space - charge - limited current ( sclc ) density of the form @xmath0 ( in the absence of charge - carrier traps ) , where @xmath1 is the sample thickness and @xmath2 is the applied voltage .",
    "the current - voltage characteristic ( iv - characteristic ) is determined by the bulk properties of the material with no influence of the contact properties @xcite .    for high injection barriers ,",
    "one anticipates the injection rate across the conductor / insulator interface to dominate the iv - characteristic of the system .",
    "the models to describe injection are the fowler - nordheim ( fn ) tunneling model @xcite or the richardson - schottky ( rs ) model @xcite for thermionic injection .",
    "the fn model describes the charge - carrier injection by tunneling through a triangular barrier into an unbound continuum of states .",
    "the current takes then the temperature independent form : @xmath3 , \\label{fowler}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the elementary charge , @xmath5 being the effective mass of a charge - carrier , @xmath6 is planck s constant , @xmath7 is a constant and @xmath8 is the height of the barrier .",
    "the rs model on the other hand describes charge injection as a thermally activated hopping over the potential barrier , where barrier lowering due to the superposition of the external electrostatic potential and the image - charge potential is considered .",
    "the rs model predicts the iv - characteristics to follow : @xmath9}\\exp { \\left [ \\frac{1}{kt}\\sqrt{\\frac{ev}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\epsilon_0 l } } \\right ] } .",

    "the steady state current density exemplarily given for holes in one dimension is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hole mobility , @xmath17 is the hole density , @xmath18 is the electric field in the insulator , and @xmath19 is the diffusivity of holes . @xmath18 and @xmath17 are coupled by the poisson equation .",
    "the drift - diffusion equation in combination with the poisson equation involves space - charge effects , but meets the problem of self - consistency in the boundary conditions .",
    "the electrostatic potential generated by the injected charge - carriers modifies the injection barrier , but on the other hand the amount of charge - carriers injected per unit time depends strongly on the barrier height .",
    "therefore , a proper description of the injection process by means of the drift - diffusion theory has to involve both , the insulator and the conductor side of the system .",
    "this can be seen in analogy to a strongly asymmetric _ pn_-junction .",
    "different attempts to numerically describe the injection process in insulators with account of the space charge were made recently @xcite .",
    "in transitive fe - simulations in one- and two - dimensional geometries by christen et al .",
    "@xcite both injection - limited and space charge - limited regimes were presented . however , the injection description was still not self - consistent imposing some phenomenological values for the field and the carrier density at the contact .",
    "a comprehensive one - dimensional numerical model accounting for space - charge effect was developed by tuti et al .",
    "@xcite which comprised the hopping transport and the tunnel injection from electrodes . unfortunately , this sophisticated numerical tool does not allow analytical fitting of current - voltage characteristics which gives insight in major mechanisms controlling injection . in the work of neumann et al .",
    "@xcite , a self - consistent numerical treatment of the injection and transport processes in a conductor / insulator / conductor device was presented in which continuity of the electrochemical potential and the electric displacement was assumed everywhere in the system , in particular at the contacts .",
    "the conductor and the insulator were characterized by their specific density of state ( dos ) distributions . in present work",
    "we obtain an exact analytical solution for the injection across the conductor / insulator interface in a self - consistent manner . to focus on the consequences of the self - consistent treatment , we discuss our results on the basis of a simplified indium tin oxide / organic semiconductor system used as hole - injecting contact in organic optoelectronic devices , shifting the comparison with experimental data to a future time .",
    "let us consider a single conductor / insulator interface located at a position @xmath20 .",
    "the conductor is supposed to extend over the semi - space with @xmath21 , whereas the insulator covers the semi - space with @xmath22 .",
    "all energies are measured downwards with respect to the top of the valence band in the conductor , in order to account for hole transport in the system . in the following sections ,",
    "the theoretical models describing the insulator and the conductor are introduced .",
    "the conductor electrode is characterized by its dos as a function of the energy @xmath23 . for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to assume the free electron approximation , in which the dos function reads : @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the effective mass in the conductor . in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite",

    "the current remains constant across the whole space and @xmath31 is given by the conductivity @xmath32 and the derivative of @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath33 ( notice the direction of the energy axis ) .",
    "the conductivity of a conductor @xmath34 can be expressed in terms of the hole mobility @xmath35 and the hole density @xmath36 in the valence band at an infinite distance from the conductor / insulator interface .    since charge - carriers are transferred from the electrode to the insulator",

    "however , charge - carrier densities in degenerate conductors are rather high and consequently , the value for the excess hole density is small in comparison with the background hole density , @xmath41 . hence , the well - known linearized thomas - fermi approximation @xcite can be applied , leading with eqs.([kappametal]-[gaussmetal ] ) to a differential equation for @xmath42 : @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the thomas - fermi screening length , defining the typical length scale of the system .",

    "an exact quantum - mechanical theory of the inhomogeneous electron gas accounting for the ionic lattice of the material and electron correlations , gives a comparable scale for the electric field penetration in conductors and demonstrates the usability of the uniform positive background model for simple metals @xcite .",
    "while in typical metals the thomas - fermi screening length is about @xmath48 making the application of the quasi - classical thomas - fermi approximation , eq.([kappametal ] ) , inappropriate , substantially larger thomas - fermi screening lengths can be found in degenerate semiconductors such as transparent conducting oxides used in optoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "similarly , the insulator is characterized by a dos function , @xmath49 , describing extended states in which charge transport takes place .",
    "in contrast to the conductor the electrochemical potential , @xmath50 , is situated well above the top of the band of extended hole states . in other words ,",
    "the insulator is supposed to be non - degenerate . introducing a band - edge",
    "means that the dos function @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the density of holes in extended states can be calculated using boltzmann statistics : @xmath53 where the energy scale has been adjusted to the top of the valence band in the conductor .",
    "the injection barrier @xmath8 is defined as the energetic difference of the top of the extended state distribution , @xmath49 , to the electrochemical potential in the conductor at an infinite distance from the interface , @xmath45 . the electrochemical potential of the insulator is then given by @xmath54 where the quantity @xmath55 can be understood as the effective total density of states available in the insulator at a given temperature .",
    "we note that the temperature dependence of @xmath56 becomes weak in the case of a narrow - band insulator .",
    "since band - gap energies are much larger than @xmath57 , thermal excitation of a charge carrier from the valence band to the conduction band of a typical insulator is virtually impossible .",
    "charge - carriers contributing to the electrical current are therefore excess charge - carriers injected from the conductor and their total density has to appear in gauss law , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the relative dielectric permittivity of the insulator .",

    "we distinguish between the equilibrium condition , where space charge zones are formed as a consequence of diffusive charge carrier transfer , and the case of a steady state current , where charge carriers are driven through the system by a time invariant external electric field .    as an example for an insulator ,",
    "an organic semiconductor can be considered .",
    "organic semiconductors show many typical characteristics of insulators like relatively large band gaps up to @xmath89 ev and hence , the absence of intrinsic charge carriers .",
    "however , it is well established that disordered organic semiconductors possess a gaussian dos @xcite compromising the applicability of eq.([nsboltzmann ] ) - organic semiconductors are degenerate systems , the tail states acting as charge carrier traps . as a consequence",
    ", one has to distinguish between trap states and transport states and fermi statistics has to be considered . yet , for weak disorder , the gaussian width is small and in the limiting case of a vanishing disorder , charge - carrier trapping in tail states is negligible and boltzmann statistics is valid .    in organic light",
    "emitting diodes ( oleds ) or field effect transistors ( ofets ) organic semiconductors are contacted with metals like au , ca , al or transparent conducting oxides like indium tin oxide ( ito ) to allow for charge carrier injection in the otherwise charge - carrier free organic semiconductor . while in metals the thomas - fermi approximation is disputable due to the prevailed low screening length of @xmath48 , the characteristic scale @xmath90 varies in ito , depending on doping @xcite , from 2.4@xmath91 to a few @xmath92 .",

    "( [ bcssx0 ] ) .    in fig.[infivdmult ] , the resulting iv - characteristics for different barrier heights are presented assuming @xmath161 . in the displayed voltage region ,",
    "the barrier - free contact ( @xmath104 ) is able to supply more charge - carriers than the bulk of the organic semiconductor can transport .",
    "hence , the entire system appears to be space - charge limited with a current approximately @xmath162 for all voltages .",
    "deviations from the mott - gurney law are due to the formation of the space - charge region emerging by charge - carrier diffusion at @xmath163 . as the current increases , the position of the virtual electrode approaches the real electrode and the width of this space charge region decreases .",
    "thus , the calculated curve reproduces the mott - gurney law @xcite more exactly for higher voltages .    .",
    "the curves for @xmath104 and @xmath164 nearly merge in the above representation._,width=283,height=241 ]    in the presence of non - vanishing barriers , the current is substantially reduced . in the low voltage regime",
    "this reduction is about one order of magnitude once the height of the barrier increases from @xmath104 to @xmath165 . for high @xmath8s , one observes a transition from a @xmath162 to a @xmath166 dependence , followed by an exponential current increase with the applied voltage .",
    "since the sclc represents an upper limit for the current flow through the system , all iv - curves approach the sclc regime for even higher voltages .",
    "the calculated iv - characteristics for high injection barriers can be understood by considering some simple approximations .",
    "once the electric field at the interface becomes positive , the charge - carrier reservoir established in the organic semiconductor is exhausted and no virtual electrode is present .",
    "hence , diffusion is negligible all over the space and an electrical current is virtually due to charge carrier drift only , @xmath167 the solution depends on @xmath70 and reads @xcite , @xmath168 analyzing the drift equation ( [ drift ] ) at @xmath134 by using the boundary condition , eq.([bcssx0 ] ) leads to an exponential dependence of the dimensionless current @xmath65 on the local value of the electric field @xmath169 where the right hand side of the boundary condition , eq.([bcssx0 ] ) , has been neglected . solving eq.([approxcurrent ] ) numerically with respect to @xmath70 for a given current density @xmath65 determines the electric field distribution , eq.([driftfield ] ) , and integrating the field over the entire system leads to the iv - characteristic .",
    "this approximation offers a simple way to calculate iv - characteristics @xcite displayed exemplary for a barrier height of @xmath165 in fig.[infivapprox ] .    .",
    "the solid line has been obtained using the exact solution ( [ solspecial ] ) of the complete drift diffusion equation ( [ dglorgdimless ] ) .",
    "the circles show the iv - characteristic calculated with the help of the semi - analytical approach derived for high injection barriers , eqs.([driftfield])-([approxcurrent ] ) , and the triangles display the injection current @xmath170 calculated with the help of eq.([injeccurrent ] ) .",
    "the dashed line shows a characteristic current of the virtual electrode appearance._,width=283,height=241 ]    the agreement with the iv - characteristic calculated using the exact solution , eq.([solspecial ] ) , is perfect for all voltages where diffusive transport of charge carriers is negligible .",
    "this includes the sclc regime at high bias . only at low voltages , where the charge carrier reservoir in the organic semiconductor is not exhausted ,",
    "deviations are recognizable . according to the exact relation , eq .",
    "( [ fieldnode ] ) , one can see that below a characteristic current @xmath171 the virtual electrode at @xmath150 appears and the diffusion becomes important .    for a purely injection - limited regime space charge effects",
    "are of no importance , resulting in a constant electric field all over the semiconductor semi - space .",
    "this field coincides with the electric field strength at the interface .",
    "in such a case @xmath172 and eq.([approxcurrent ] ) governs the injection limited iv - characteristics alone , @xmath173 .",
    "\\label{injeccurrent}\\ ] ] eq.([injeccurrent ] ) resembles the result of the drift - diffusion equation @xcite . yet",
    ", the self - consistent treatment of the injection problem yields directly a barrier lowering arising from the potential energy a charge carrier gains on the conductor side of the interface .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath174 dependence of the schottky - lowering predicted from the image - charge potential in the single - electron picture , the current density depends exponentially on the external voltage @xmath2 .",
    "the injection - limited current @xmath175 is depicted in fig.[infivapprox ] .",
    "once space charge effects become predominant , @xmath70 can be neglected in eq.([driftfield ] ) and the temperature - independent mott - gurney law is reproduced .",
    "this occurs as soon as the field - induced barrier lowering has proceeded to such extent that the contact can again establish space charge in the organic semiconductor .",
    "hence , a transition from injection - limited to space - charge - limited current is observed . as may be seen from fig.[infivapprox ]",
    ", the crossover from injection - limited to sclc occurs at rather high voltages in presence of a medium injection barrier of @xmath176 .",
    "this has its origin in the weak barrier lowering for increasing external voltage . due to the low screening length in the conductor , a high voltage drop across the entire system",
    "is required to result in an energy gain in the conductor being comparable to the injection - barrier energy .",
    "note that in contrast to a space - charge formation resulting from diffusion , the electric field at the contact is positive once the space - charge formation is solely due to a drift - controlled injection .",
    "such a sclc regime occurs also for barrier - free injection as soon as the diffusive filling of the space - charge region is weaker than its depletion due to the external applied field .",
    "this , however , requires a very high bias . as a result",
    ", the sclc is directly supplied by an efficient charge - carrier drift out of the conductor .    from eq.([injeccurrent ] ) and mott - gurney law one can estimate the upper limit of the barrier required to retain sclc over the whole voltage range : @xmath177 assuming the parameters introduced before , we can predict a critical barrier height of @xmath178 .",
    "this is in slight contradiction to device models in which a schottky - type barrier lowering is assumed @xcite .",
    "here , one would expect the crossover between sclc and injection - limited current to occur at an injection barrier of @xmath179 .",
    "however , up to now the experimental data available predict the crossover to be at a barrier height between @xmath180 and @xmath181 , being consistent with both approaches .",
    "in the calculation of the charge - carrier transport through insulators , a fundamental question about the boundary conditions generally arises when a charge - carrier injecting interface has to be involved .",
    "typically , boundary conditions at the interface are chosen , fixing there the charge carrier density and/or the electric field . however , at the conductor / insulator contact the system is ill - defined , meaning that especially at the interface the charge carrier density and the electric field strongly depend on the condition of the system .    in this paper ,",
    "a one - dimensional analytical model describing the charge - carrier transport across a conductor / insulator junction was presented , where boundary conditions are defined far into the conductor and the insulator , respectively . here",
    ", the influence of the two materials on each other is negligible so that they can be regarded as independent . considering the poisson equation and assuming the electric displacement as well as the electrochemical potential being continuous over the entire system",
    ", the electric field distribution and the current - voltage characteristic were derived .",
    "the model predicts sclc , injection - limited conduction as well as the crossover between the two limits . in most current regimes ,",
    "the influence of the self - consistent treatment is noticeable . for pure injection - limited conduction , an injection current",
    "similar to the prediction of the drift - diffusion theory was derived . however , due to the consistent treatment of the injection problem in one dimension , a barrier lowering different to the one predicted from the three - dimensional image - charge potential in the single - electron picture emerges .",
    "this injection - barrier lowering results from the potential energy gain ( or loss ) of the charge - carriers in the electrode . also for sclc , a deviation of the mott - gurney law is observable as long as the virtual electrode does not match the physical one . only at high bias",
    "the self - consistent treatment has no influence on the iv - characteristic and the well known mott - gurney law is fully reproduced .",
