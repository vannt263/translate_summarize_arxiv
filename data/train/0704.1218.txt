    "this discovery points to a fundamental connection between the growth of central bhs and the formation of stellar spheroids in galaxies .",

    "simulations of the impact of these agn - driven radio cavities suggest that this powerful feedback provides sufficient energy to offset the cooling radiation from the cluster and potentially explain why so little cool ( @xmath3 ) gas is seen in these systems @xcite .    motivated by these discoveries , simple prescriptions for the feedback from agn ( aka .",

    "including radio - mode agn feedback has resulted in dramatic improvements in the models ability to match the sharp decline of the galaxy luminosity function and to explain the `` down - sizing '' seen in the evolution of the galaxy population . in particular , @xcite shows that , by assuming that agn feedback operates only in quasi - hydrostatic halos where the cooling time is longer than the dynamical time @xcite , the galaxy luminosity functions in local and higher redshifts universe can be matched well .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that similar results were obtained by modifying the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion rate formula @xcite to account for the multiphase structure of the accreting gas in rapidly cooling halos .",
    "recent simulations also have begun to track the impact of agn feedback on the galaxy population @xcite .",
    "one of the first hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation which invoked agn feedback was performed by @xcite by using cosmological simulations with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "they reproduced observed x - ray and optical properties of elliptical galaxies by injecting thermal energy into the centre of the main progenitor at @xmath4 , assuming that sufficient bh mass was present for the agn to be active when a convergent gas inflow exists at the centre of the main progenitor . a self - consistent model for agn `` quasar - mode '' feedback associated with bh accretion in simulations of galaxy mergers was proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they estimated accretion rate onto bhs by using a bondi - hoyle - lyttleton parameterisation and injected some fraction of accreted rest mass energy into the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) in the form of thermal energy . by using this model and performing a series of merger simulations , @xcite simulated evolution of quasar luminosity and predicted luminosity functions of quasars .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new methodology to incorporate bh growth and agn radio feedback self - consistently in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation . we are motivated to do this by the recent semi - analytic models that we have discussed above .",
    "these indicate that the distinction between `` quasar '' and `` radio '' modes is necessary to achieve good matches to the global properties of galaxies .",
    "we distinguish these two modes depending on the accretion rate onto the central bhs assuming that the radio - mode exists only when the accretion rate onto the bh is low .",
    "we estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central bhs by combining a radiation drag model by @xcite with our description of the ism and star formation .",
    "a virtue of the radiation drag model is that it relates star formation activity in galactic centre , which can be resolved in our simulations , to mass accretion onto a central bhs .",
    "it implies that a fixed fraction of the star formation in bulges is converted into bh mass just as assumed in most semi - analytic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since our estimate of the accretion rate onto central bhs is based on radiation from stars , the mass growth of bhs in our simulations is resolution independent so long as the star formation is modelled in a resolution independent fashion .    in order to model the agn radio - mode feedback , we distinguish two fundamentally different modes of agn accretion : radiatively efficient geometrically thin accretion flows ( standard disks ;",
    "* ) and geometrically thick , radiatively inefficient accretion flows .",
    "we assume only the latter are responsible for the radio - mode feedback through production of powerful jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this assertion is supported by theoretical models for jet production since the jet power is intimately linked to the scale of the magnetic field loops in the vicinity of the last stable orbit around the bh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since riafs exist only when the accretion rate is much lower than the eddington rate @xcite , agns can produce strong feedback in objects which have low specific star formation rates because the radiation drag model directly connects the star formation rate around bhs and mass accretion rate onto the bhs .",
    "given the limited numerical resolution inherent in our simulations , we adopt a subgrid model for the impact of the agn feedback .",
    "we simply assume that a certain fraction of the available jet power thermally couples to nearby diffuse halo gas .    until today , most of simulations of galaxy formation with agn feedback aimed to form elliptical galaxies because the agn feedback is the most plausible mechanism that halts the star formation activity in elliptical galaxies @xcite",
    ". therefore roles of agn feedback in disk galaxy formation are still largely unknown in spite that disk galaxies also harbour central supermassive bhs in their bulges . in this paper",
    "we hence focus on the impact that feedback from an agn jet might have on the formation of a large disk galaxy , and the resulting coevolution of the agn and the host galaxy .",
    "the majority of agn hosted by disk galaxies are known to be either seyfert nuclei or the lowest luminosity agn , the low - ionisation nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "several targeted observations of individual objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that seyfert galaxies commonly host compact radio jets spanning @xmath5 pc which strongly affect the state of the ism and contribute to its ionisation via shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also common that kpc - scale radio structures are observed , which are thought as extensions of the inner radio jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and sometimes blow out of the galactic disk with no preferential direction @xcite .",
    "very large array surveys of samples of seyfert and liner galaxies indicate that radio outflows with extent @xmath6 kpc are a common feature in seyfert galaxies , and presumably are driven by the agn jets @xcite .",
    "@xcite in particular find that @xmath7 of the galaxies in their complete sample display kpc - scale radio outflows , and they can not rule out that most seyfert galaxies produce extended radio outflows .",
    "the kinetic power carried by the seyfert jets as estimated from observations can be as high as @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if an appreciable fraction of this power reaches out of the nuclear region , then the jets may affect the environment of the agn and be a source of feedback in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the impact of feedback from agn jets on the nuclear environment of the host disk galaxies and the evolution of the nuclear activity during the formation of the disk galaxy are open problems , which we attack using our cosmological simulations . in this paper , we show that distinguishing the two modes of agn accretion yields results which are in broad agreement with observations of seyferts .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first describe our microscopic descriptions of the ism , star formation , and stellar feedback in section 2 and bh growth and agn feedback in section 3 .",
    "we present the details of our cosmological simulations in section 4 and the results in section 5 .",
    "finally , we summarise and discuss our results in section 6 .",
    "readers who are observation - oriented and are not interested in the technical details of the simulation may wish to skip directly to section [ obs ] , where we compare our results with observations of nuclear activity in seyfert galaxies .",
    "in order to study the effect of agn feedback on galaxy formation , we construct a physically motivated , well - controlled model of the star - forming gas .",
    "based on the simplest star formation and feedback recipes used in the first generation of hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation @xcite , several authors have introduced ` multiphase ' models for star - forming gas in which the ism is treated as a number of distinct phases by formulating differential equations that model the interactions between the phases ( @xcite ; springel & hernquist 2003 hereafter @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite but see @xcite where they explicitly model ` clouds ' by means of sticky particles in sph simulations ) . our model is based on the one used in @xcite but has been significantly modified .",
    "we describe the details in the following subsections .",
    "we compute the non - equilibrium cooling / heating rate and ionisation state of each gas particle by using the cooling functions in @xcite which include cooling by h , he , and metals , in the presence of an evolving but uniform ultraviolet background @xcite that is switched on at @xmath9 .",
    "inverse compton cooling is also included .",
    "metals are carried by particles and once assigned to a particle , they remain with it . nonetheless , effective",
    "mixing takes place because we use the smoothed metallicity ( smoothed in the same way as other sph quantities ) when computing the cooling rate and defining the metallicity of a newly - formed star .      as in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we treat an sph particle as a hybrid particle that consists of two distinct phases , i.e. hot ambient gas and cold clouds , once its gas density , @xmath10 , exceeds a density threshold , @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the cold clouds form and grow through thermal instability , that is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are mass in cold clouds and mass in the hot phase associated with the particle , respectively , @xmath15 is the cooling function for gas of metallicity @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent specific internal energy of the hot phase and cold clouds , respectively .",
    "this implies that we assume that the gas is thermally unstable when @xmath19 .",
    "cold clouds remain at a fixed temperature , @xmath20 hence @xmath18 is a constant as well .",
    "note , however , as far as @xmath21 is much lower than @xmath22 k our results are hardly affected by the choice of @xmath21 .",
    "we allow cold clouds to have a mass spectrum @xmath23 observationally @xmath24 is in a range between @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "since the effect of changing the value of @xmath24 is completely degenerate with changing other parameters we will introduce such as star formation efficiency and thermal conduction efficiency , we simply fix @xmath27 and the mass range of clouds , @xmath28@xmath29 , throughout this paper .",
    "following @xcite , we assume spherical clouds which follow the mass - radius relation of @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure in the ambient hot phase which is equal to the effective pressure of the particle .",
    "we assume that giant molecular clouds in mass range of @xmath32 to @xmath33 are eligible to form stars with a star formation timescale that is proportional to the dynamical time of each cloud .",
    "therefore the star formation rate for a cloud of mass @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is stellar mass , @xmath37 is the star formation timescale for a cloud of mass @xmath34 , @xmath38 is a dimensionless star formation efficiency parameter that must be less than unity , and @xmath39 is the dynamical timescale of the cloud .",
    "for the mass - radius relation in equation  ( [ mr ] ) , the dynamical timescale of a cloud of mass @xmath34 is given as @xmath40^{1/2 } \\simeq 0.32 \\",
    "p_4^{-3/8 } \\left ( \\frac{m}{m_\\odot } \\right)^{1/4 } { \\rm myr},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the mean density of a cloud of mass @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that now the star formation timescale is a function of ambient pressure and it could be very short in high - pressure medium .",
    "therefore we naturally have ` shock - induced ' starbursts that @xcite introduced by changing the star formation efficiency by hand when the rate of change of the entropy by shock heating exceeds a threshold value .",
    "the total star formation rate for clouds of total mass of @xmath42 with the mass spectrum @xmath43 is obtained by integrating @xmath44 over the range of masses that are eligible to form stars , @xmath45 where the normalisation @xmath46 is applied .",
    "the different phases of the ism exchange mass by evaporation . as in @xcite",
    ", we use the model of @xcite for the cloud evaporation , that is , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the dimensionless conduction efficiency parameter , the mean molecular weight , the conductivity where we use the spitzer value @xcite , the radius of the cloud , and the boltzmann constant .",
    "the total evaporation rate for clouds of total mass @xmath42 then becomes @xmath53      we consider each stellar particle as a single stellar population ( ssp ) having its own age , metallicity and initial mass function ( imf ) @xmath54 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the imf is always the salpeter imf @xcite whose lower and upper mass limits are @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 , respectively . the recycled mass fraction , type ii and type ia supernova ( sn ) rates , and metal production rates for some species are calculated according to the age , metallicity , and imf of the ssp . each sn is assumed to give @xmath58 erg of energy to surrounding gas , where @xmath59 is the feedback efficiency parameter .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite and references therein for a more detailed description .",
    "we have implemented the physics described above into a publicly available pm - treesph code gadget2 @xcite , a successor of the treesph code gadget @xcite .",
    "we do not use the instantaneous recycling approximation ( ira ) which is often assumed in studies of galaxy formation .",
    "in this section we describe how the physical processes described above are implemented in our code .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "an sph particle is eligible to form cold clouds .",
    "hence it is eligible to form stars .",
    "we compute the probability @xmath60 of a sph particle spawning a new star particle of mass @xmath36 during a time - step @xmath61 as @xmath62,\\ ] ] where the average star formation timescale @xmath63 is obtained by using equation ( [ totsf ] ) : @xmath64 we use @xmath65 as in @xcite , where @xmath66 denotes the original sph particle mass .",
    "when an sph particle spawns a star particle , the mass in cold clouds is reduced by @xmath36 .",
    "we relax the ira through a probabilistic treatment of sne ii and ia .",
    "first , we assume that stars more massive than @xmath67 explode as sne ii .",
    "the probability @xmath68 of a star particle having an event of sn ii explosion during a time - step @xmath61 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the age of the ssp , @xmath71 is the sn ii rate for the ssp of age @xmath70 and @xmath72 is the lifetime of the star of original mass @xmath67 . when a star particle satisfies the condition to have an event of sn ii we distribute mass , metals , and feedback energy , which are expelled by the total sne ii between @xmath73 and @xmath74 to the surrounding gas particles using the sph kernel weighting .",
    "since the sn ia rate is much lower than the sn ii rate , we allow star particles to have only one sn ia explosion event for each sn ia time - step @xmath75 , which is much longer than the time - steps for dynamical calculation . by doing this",
    ", we substantially reduce the computational expense that is needed mainly for the neighbour search to distribute energy , mass , and metals . as for sn",
    "ii , we can compute the sn ia probability during a time - step @xmath61 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the age at which the previous sn ia time - step finished and @xmath78 is the sn ia rate for a ssp of age @xmath70 .",
    "we adopt @xmath79 myr in this paper .",
    "the probabilistic method described above statistically relaxes the ira .",
    "finally , we update the mass of the hot phase @xmath14 and the specific internal energy of the hot phase @xmath17 .",
    "the new mass of the hot phase @xmath80 is given by solving the thermal energy equation implicitly using equation ( [ cool ] ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mass which evaporates from cold clouds during the time - step , and the new density of the hot phase @xmath83 is given by the mass conservation , @xmath84 , and by the assumption that the volume occupied by a sph particle remains the same during the time - step , i.e. @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the volume occupied by the cold clouds computed using the mass - radius relation ( eq .",
    "[ mr ] ) .",
    "in addition to the adiabatic heating / cooling and shock heating , non - hydrodynamic processes such as sn feedback and cloud evaporation also change the specific energy of the hot phase .",
    "the new specific energy of the hot phase @xmath87 due to the non - hydrodynamic processes is also calculated implicitly as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the thermal energy received by the sph particle during the time - step .",
    "note however that we model the sn feedback not as the thermal heating of the ism but as the kinetic heating described in the following subsection as _",
    "winds_. this is motivated by the results from high - resolution 2d and 3d simulations of the ism @xcite in which they showed that the ism is supported by the turbulent motion originated in the self - gravity of the gas and galactic rotation .",
    "they found that energy injection by sne hardly changes the structure of the ism .",
    "@xcite also indicated that the energy feedback from sne does not change the structure of the ism but significantly reduces the amount of gas in the galaxy in their cosmological simulation performed with an adaptive mesh refinement code .",
    "lacking the heating by the @xmath89 term , the ism loses its pressure quickly and would be fragmented .",
    "we therefore introduce _ minimal heating _ by imposing the minimum pressure for the star forming gas as a function of density , @xmath90 by which we mimic the heating from self - gravity and galactic shear motion claimed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . we adopt in this paper the value @xmath91 for the effective adiabatic index , which is close to the value found by @xcite for dense gas and is stable against gravitational instability ( the critical value is 4/3 ) . we normalise the minimum pressure as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the specific internal energy of the gas with temperature @xmath22 k. once pressure from the hot phase drops below @xmath94",
    ", we set the temperature of the hot phase to @xmath95 and recalculate the mass in cold clouds so that the ambient pressure becomes @xmath94 .",
    "we set @xmath95 to @xmath96 k in this paper but our results are hardly affected by the value of @xmath95 as far as @xmath97 k. in quiescent disks , most of the star forming gas has @xmath94 by construction",
    ". however , for example during a violent merger , the pressure can be significantly higher than @xmath94 due to shock heating and hence the gas can have very short star formation timescale .      as discussed in @xcite",
    ", we explicitly assume that cold clouds and hot ambient medium remain tightly coupled in high - density regions .",
    "hence , there is no obvious route for the high entropy gas to escape from the star forming regions .",
    "we thus extend our feedback model to account for galactic winds by sn feedback .",
    "our model is based on @xcite and is modified to take the non - instantaneous sn explosions into account .",
    "first , we specify the velocity of the wind , @xmath98 , when it leaves the disk .",
    "then , we assign the probability @xmath99 with which the gas particle is added to the wind as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mass of the gas particle and @xmath89 is the feedback energy received during the time - step . by doing this",
    ", our model becomes insensitive to the numerical resolution , time - step in the simulations , and the number of neighbours we use to distribute the feedback energy .",
    "when a particle is added to the wind , we modify the velocity @xmath102 of the particle according to @xmath103 for the unit vector @xmath104 , we choose random orientation along the direction @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "therefore wind particles are preferentially ejected along the rotation axis of a spinning object as the ` axial wind ' in @xcite .",
    "we also decouple a new wind particle from hydrodynamic interactions for a brief time such that the winds originate from a region close to the surface of the star forming region .",
    "the full hydrodynamic interactions are enabled again once the density of the particle has fallen to 0.1 @xmath11 , or once a time of @xmath61 = 20 myr has elapsed , whichever happens earlier .      in this paper we use the following parameters for star formation and sn feedback as a fiducial model ; the threshold density , @xmath107 g @xmath108 , the dimensionless star formation efficiency , @xmath109 , the dimensionless conductivity efficiency , @xmath110 , the sn feedback efficiency , @xmath111 , and the wind velocity @xmath112 km s@xmath113 .",
    "the relatively low value of @xmath38 compared to other papers comes from the fact that we use the dynamical time of each cloud not the dynamical time for sph particles .",
    "we choose the values of @xmath11 and @xmath38 so that our model reproduce the observed relation between surface gas density and surface star formation rate density @xcite .",
    "the most important parameters in our model are the feedback efficiency and the wind velocity .",

    "the bulge - to - total mass ratio of the ` slow - wind ' model is 0.9 and the @xmath262 colour of this galaxy is consistent with the mean colour of the red population at @xmath0 .    the evolution of the accretion rates in the ` ism - fb ' and ` max - fb ' models are similar to that in the ` reference ' model particularly at high redshift ( @xmath278 gyr ) where the accretion disc is thin ( @xmath283 ) .",

    "since the agn feedback energy is deposited into the surrounding star forming ism particles in this model , it can terminate star formation around the bh more directly than in the ` reference ' model where the agn feedback energy is distributed to the halo gas . in the max - fb model , there is no accretion event after @xmath284 gyr .",

    "[ mm2 ] tell us an important feature of the radiation drag model , that is , the @xmath289 relation after the last starburst does not depend on either the wind speed or efficiency of agn feedback . in all models ,",
    "the central bh masses are @xmath290% of the mass of their host spheroids , @xmath291 , when the accretion becomes radiatively inefficient .",
    "as we have shown in  [ relativeimportance ] , for @xmath292 the bolometric luminosity of the agn is feeble compared to the host galaxy and the nucleus undergoes several recurring episodes of activity . during these episodes when the nucleus is active ,",
    "its characteristic accretion rate is in the range @xmath293 , while the typical nuclear bolometric luminosities and jet powers are @xmath294 and @xmath295 respectively . given these properties , at @xmath292 during which the galactic disk is formed , the agn can be considered to be in a highly sub - eddington , low - luminosity or seyfert state which undergoes a stochastic cycle of activity .",
    "the seyfert nucleus is sometimes turned on , but most of the time is `` off '' or inactive with @xmath296 , resembling the nucleus of a normal spiral galaxy .",
    "the `` on '' episodes are induced by the inward motion of clumps of cold gas into the centre of the galaxy , which provide a replenishment of new stars . the radiation drag or poynting - robertson effect caused by stellar radiation in the central star - forming region then dissipates the angular momentum of the gas and fuels the agn .",
    "our model suggests that reasonably powerful jet outbursts accompany each `` on '' episode of the low - luminosity agn , suggesting that , in analogy to the observed states of agns , during the active phases the seyfert nucleus would be seen as radio - loud , becoming radio - quiet during the `` off '' phase . in this section",
    ", we compare the properties of our simulated agn with those of observed ones in disk galaxies .    in the reference model , the range of values obtained for the agn bolometric luminosity for @xmath292 agrees well with the median observational values for liners ( median @xmath297 ) and seyferts ( median @xmath298 ) inferred from the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies @xcite . since the seyfert episodes of the central agn coincide with jet outburst events during which the agn would be seen as radio - loud in our simulations , this suggests that observed seyfert / liner nuclei would be mostly radio - loud objects rather than radio - quiet given their formation history , contrary to the generally held notion existent in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite however investigated several low - luminosity agn and their radio - loudness classification , obtaining that a large fraction of seyfert / liner nuclei are radio - loud , a finding that corroborates our results .",
    "in particular , @xcite obtained that @xmath299 of the sources in their sample are radio - loud .    in our simulations ,",
    "the numerical resolution is not sufficient to resolve the details of the propagation of the jet as it flows out of the agn and how it transfer its power to the surrounding medium , for instance the spatial resolution is 0.5 kpc . as such",
    ", we assume that a fraction of the jet power is injected as thermal energy in the diffuse gas around the agn on kpc - scales .",
    "the size of the region which is affected by the feedback from the agn may be as large as @xmath300 kpc , although the jet itself is not resolved in the simulation .",
    "two important questions arise : ( a ) are the heating effects due to jets generated in seyfert galaxies able to affect kpc - scales and ( b ) can they be a source of feedback ?",
    "observations provides appealing clues to answering these questions .",
    "several observational studies of seyferts suggest that seyfert jets may indeed reach kpc - scales and beyond .",
    "the very large array surveys of @xcite and @xcite find that extended kpc - scale radio outflows most probably associated with jets are common in seyfert galaxies , although they can not rule out entirely the possibility that these outflows arise from starburst - driven winds in some sources .",
    "these radio outflows have random orientations with respect to the host galaxy , a result which is maintained for jets observed from sub - kpc to kpc scales @xcite , and have distorted , uncollimated morphologies . therefore the observed radio outflows could provide a broad effective surface for depositing the jet power in the surrounding gas , as envisioned in our simulations .",
    "several targeted observations of individual seyfert galaxies also demonstrate that kpc - scale radio jets are not a rare feature in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations also reveal kpc - scale outflows of x - ray - emitting hot plasma in seyfert galaxies @xcite , cospatial with the large scale radio outflows .",
    "two favoured interpretations are that these kpc - scale x - ray outflows are generated either by the agn jets that entrain and heat gas as they flow out of the nucleus , or through heating of the surrounding gas via thermalisation of the kinetic power of the jet , generating a wind .",
    "either way , these processes bear resemblance to the generation of cavities or bubbles of x - ray emitting plasma in the central elliptical galaxies of clusters of galaxies , which are inflated by the radio jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these observations therefore provide evidence for the possible importance of feedback due to the radio jets in seyfert galaxies , which could heat the circumnuclear plasma and generate x - ray emitting outflows .",
    "observational estimates of the kinetic power carried by the jets in seyferts using different methods indicate that it is in the range @xmath301 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this observational range is in agreement with the values of the jet power which are generated during the radio - loud episodes for @xmath292 in the simulation , @xmath295 ( fig .",
    "[ relative ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the jet power in our simulation is estimated using a physical model for the energetics of the jet , which depends on fundamental parameters of central engine , especially the accretion rate which is self - consistently calculated .",
    "the fraction of the jet power generated by the agn which is actually available to heat the gas on kpc - scales is a matter of debate . in the ` reference ' simulation",
    "we adopt that a fraction @xmath182 of the jet power is deposited as thermal energy of the diffuse gas , although it is possible that this may be an overestimate of the value of @xmath302 .",
    "for instance , based on ram pressure and terminal velocity considerations of the lobes of kpc - scale radio outflows in seyferts , @xcite argues that the seyfert jets lose almost all their power within the inner kpc , implying that @xmath302 may be considerably smaller than 0.1 .",
    "the other simulations we present encompass the uncertainty in the value of @xmath302 . in this respect ,",
    "the simulation adopting @xmath303 does not show any significant difference from the simulation without agn feedback ( @xmath274 ) . on the other hand , when 100% of the jet energy is transferred to the surrounding star forming gas ( ` ism - fb ' model ) , most of the feedback energy",
    "is rapidly radiated away , and the results are very similar to the ` reference ' model in which 10% of jet energy is given to the ambient halo gas .",
    "thus , a better knowledge on the `` microscopic '' physics of jet - ism interactions is required in order to improve the understanding of the effects of agn feedback in seyfert galaxies .",
    "our simulations show that during the cosmological formation of a typical spiral galaxy , a low - luminosity agn ( seyfert or liner ) is formed which has a stochastic cycle of activity , with many short - lived recurrent accretion events accompanied by jet outbursts .",
    "this finding agrees with the conclusion of @xcite that the seyfert activity is the result of short - lived stochastic accretion events .",
    "he arrived at this conclusion by considering plausible mechanisms that may fuel the central black holes of seyferts , which are stochastic in nature , and our simulations track the evolution of the agn by implementing one of these mechanisms : the accretion of molecular clouds to the galactic centre .",
    "our findings therefore provide support to the assumption of @xcite , central to their work , that the central supermassive bhs of seyferts stochastically increase their mass by accretion of cold gas .    in the period @xmath292",
    "after the galactic disk is formed , the agn is active only during a fraction @xmath304 of the its life in the ` reference ' model , @xmath305 in the ` weak - fb ' model and @xmath306 in the ` ism - fb ' model .",
    "this implies that the lifetime of seyfert activity in the spiral galaxy is @xmath307 yr for the ` reference ' or ` weak - fb ' model and @xmath308 yr for the ` ism - fb ' model .",
    "this is in agreement with statistical seyfert lifetime @xmath309 yr estimated by counting the fraction of spiral galaxies that are observed to be seyferts @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that each single episode of activity would not last longer than @xmath96 yr based on the size of seyfert jets , a prediction which is in agreement with the detailed study of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the time - step we used to output snapshot files is 16.8 myr and therefore we may miss many of such short - lived events . considering this , the ` ism - fb ' model may be more comfortable than the ` reference ' model because there is no long - lived accretion event in the ` ism - fb ' model for @xmath292 ( lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ difffb ] ) .",
    "it is also possible that the observed short duration of activity is not caused by the large - scale mass accretion to the galactic centres but by the physical processes in the accretion disk ( e.g. , instabilities ) which we do not take into account in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a new methodology that enables us to simultaneously model star formation , sn feedback , bh accretion , and agn feedback in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "our treatment of black hole accretion is based on a theoretical model of the mass accretion into the galactic centre due to radiation drag .",
    "this connects the kpc - scale star formation activity in the galactic centre with the bh accretion rate .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the recent semi - analytic models of @xcite and @xcite , we have distinguished two distinct accretion modes of bh fuelling , namely standard ( optically thick , geometrically thin ) shakura - sunyaev disks and ( geometrically thick , optically thin ) riafs .",
    "this allows us to distinguish radio loud and radio quiet agns depending on their mass accretion rate . in this model ,",
    "we only consider agn radio feedback in which we assume a fraction of the jet power is thermally coupled with the surrounding diffuse gas , and assume riafs are responsible for production of powerful jets . as the first application of this model",
    ", we have performed cosmological simulations of the formation of a disk galaxy and its coevolution with the central agn .",
    "our results reveal a fundamental agn - starburst connection during the evolution of the galaxy and the central agn . during the starburst period ( @xmath310 )",
    "there is a lot of gas available to be accreted and the agn is fuelled at high accretion rates , as a consequence the accretion disk is in the standard / thin state and the agn is relatively luminous and produces weak jets ( radio - quiet state ) .",
    "the starburst phase ceases at @xmath230 because most of the gas at the galactic centre is consumed by star formation or blown out by the associated sn feedback .",
    "afterwards , the agn fuelling rate drops and the accretion disk then switches to a radiatively inefficient ( riaf ) state . due to a combination of small accretion rates and the low radiative efficiency of the riaf , the agn becomes a low - luminosity agn or seyfert nucleus which is almost invisible compared to the host galaxy . at this point",
    "even a little star formation activity around the central bh triggers intense jet production that regulates further gas cooling to the centre .",
    "thus , in the quiescent star forming regime after @xmath230 the agn has a stochastic fuelling , undergoing several short - lived recurrent episodes of activity . during",
    "these accretion episodes the agn brightness increases and jet outbursts are generated , which correspond to the radio - loud state . in - between these seyfert episodes",
    "the nucleus is turned off and the galaxy is inactive",
    ".    below @xmath230 agn feedback becomes important if 10% of jet energy is available to heat the ambient diffuse halo gas ( or 100% is fed into the surrounding ism ) .",
    "this powerful episodic agn feedback suppresses star formation in the disc and almost completely halts the star formation in the bulge .",
    "this effect is minor when the wind speed due to sn feedback is fast compared to the circular velocity of the host halo because the sn feedback alone can suppress the star formation in the bulge reasonably well . when the wind speed is slow compared to the circular velocity of the host halo ,",
    "the agn feedback becomes more important .",
    "this leads to the formation of an old , red elliptical galaxy in the ` slow - wind ' model .",
    "many properties of the simulated low - luminosity agn and its jets are in broad agreement with observations of seyfert galaxies and their jets : namely its typical nuclear bolometric luminosity and radio luminosity , the coincidence of the radio - loud state with the seyfert episodes , the fact that the jet may reach kpc - scales and strongly affect the surrounding gas on these scales , and the predicted agn lifetime and duration of individual episodes of activity . the stochastic pattern of nuclear activity that emerges from our simulation seems to confirm the prediction of @xcite for seyfert galaxies .",
    "the ratios between the central bh mass and the mass of the host spheroid at @xmath0 in our simulations are @xmath1 regardless of the strength of either sn or agn feedback .",
    "this result is direct outcome of the radiation drag model which relates the star formation rate in the central star - forming region and the mass accretion rate to the central bh .",
    "the ratio is in good agreement with the observed ratio @xcite , although the efficiency of the radiation drag we assumed to obtain this ratio is somewhat higher than the value suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , as we have discussed , the geometry and density structure of star forming regions can easily change the efficiency .",
    "we also note that recent semi - analytic models @xcite and cosmological simulations @xcite suggest that stars may be born with top - heavy imfs ( and thus stronger radiation fields and higher radiation drag efficiencies ) in starbursts",
    ". the accretion rate by radiation drag can be much higher with this assumption because stellar populations with top - heavy imfs produce more radiation .",
    "the self - consistent treatment of bh accretion and associated agn feedback in galaxy formation enables us to explore the interplay between galaxies and agns in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "the self - regulation of mass accretion due to feedback from riafs produces galaxies whose agn properties are well matched to the observations .",
    "the model is also qualitatively consistent with recent semi - analytic models that successfully reproduce many of the global properties of the galaxy population .",
    "the effects of our agn feedback implementation on formation of groups of galaxies , where more powerful agn feedback from larger bhs is expected , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",

    "<S> this suppression of the star formation regulates mass accretion onto the black hole and associated agn feedback . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus becomes a stochastically fuelled low - luminosity agn ( seyfert galaxy ) with recurrent short - lived episodes of activity after the star bursts . during the `` on '' events the agn produces reasonably powerful jets ( radio - loud state ) and is less luminous than the host galaxy , while in the `` off '' phase the nucleus is inactive and `` radio - quiet '' . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts several properties of the low - luminosity agn including the bolometric luminosity , jet powers , the effect on kpc - scale of the radio jet and the agn lifetime , which are in broad agreement with observations of seyfert galaxies and their radio activity . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the ratios between the central black hole mass and the mass of the host spheroid at @xmath0 are @xmath1 regardless of the strength of either supernova feedback or agn feedback because the radiation drag model directly relates the star formation activity in the galactic centre and the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole .    </S>",
