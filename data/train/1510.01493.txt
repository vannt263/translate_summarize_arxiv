    "this local result is wrong if we merely assume that the integrals are smooth : locally the geodesic flow of any metric is smoothly integrable .",
    "this result is known in the folklore and we formulate it and give a sketch of the proof at the end of the paper , see proposition [ lastt ] .",
    "the explanation of this visual contradiction is that for a generic metric ( which can be even real analytic ) , the integral ( which can be real analytic on the unit bundle @xmath80 ) can not be real - analytically extended to the whole cotangent bundle ; we shall make this point more clear in the conclusion .",

    "this replacement does not change the mappings @xmath230 for @xmath231 , because we will replace only the vectors @xmath197 , @xmath198 and these vectors are not used in the construction of the mappings @xmath230 .",

    "the condition @xmath239 is a system of linear equations on @xmath240 whose coefficients come from @xmath241 .",
    "consequently , the condition that a homogeneous polynomial @xmath240 of degree @xmath11 is invariant with respect to the whole group @xmath201 is the following infinite system of linear equations : @xmath242 since any homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath11 invariant with respect to the whole group @xmath201 is trivial , we obtain that the rank of this system of equations is @xmath44 for @xmath11 odd and @xmath243 for @xmath11 even .",

    "it is easy to check that this map is epimorphic for @xmath259 , which means that there are no relations between the linear equations of the system ( compatibility conditions ) up to this prolongation .",

    "theorem [ thm:2 ] is proven .    in the proof of theorem [ thm:2 ] , in order to apply theorem [ folklore ] , we only need the existence of one real - analytic metric ( on a disc of an arbitrary dimension ) that does not admit a nontivial integral of degree @xmath11 .",

    "we consider @xmath293 with the canonical symplectic structure and the hamiltonian action on it generated by the hamiltonian @xmath22 of the geodesic flow .",
    "of course , the action is only locally defined and the projection of its orbits to @xmath28 are geodesic segments ; because of geodesic convexity the endpoints of these segments lie on the boundary @xmath295 .",

    "the result is a symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath297 , which we denote by @xmath298 .",
    "though it is not important for our proof , let us mention that in the riemannian case @xmath298 is diffeomorphic to @xmath299 .",
    "indeed , the points of @xmath298 are oriented geodesic segments with endpoints on the boundary , and so can be parameterised by outward unit vectors along the boundary ( whose natural projection to @xmath299 gives an open neighborhood of the zero section ) .",
    "denote by @xmath300 the tautological projection .",
    "it is a general property of the symplectic reduction that for any function @xmath301 the function @xmath302 is an integral of the restriction of the geodesic flow to @xmath303 .",
