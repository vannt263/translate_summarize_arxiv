    "the goal of this paper is to determine the asymptotic behavior ( as @xmath18 ) of the recurrence coefficients @xmath19 and of the leading coefficient @xmath20 , and to determine plancherel - rotach type asymptotics for the orthonormal polynomials @xmath14 in the entire complex plane .",
    "in addition , we use these asymptotics to prove universality results for laguerre - type unitary ensembles .",
    "the weights considered in this paper fall into the class of freud weights on @xmath0 .",
    "these weights are also closely related to symmetric freud weights on @xmath21 by a simple transformation so that our results can also be applied to freud weights of the form @xmath22 on @xmath21 with @xmath23 .",
    "there is a vast literature on asymptotic questions with respect to freud weights and we will now briefly summarize the results which are already known with respect to weights ( [ weight ] ) .",

    "full asymptotic description of the orthogonal polynomials and related quantities are known in the following special cases .",
    "first , the classical laguerre case , i.e.  @xmath9 and @xmath2 , is described in @xcite .",
    "next , for @xmath24 and @xmath3 a polynomial , the asymptotics are known from results of deift , kriecherbauer , mclaughlin , venakides and zhou in @xcite .",

    "the main goal was to prove universality of spectral correlations of the associated random matrix ensembles at the hard edge @xmath30 .",
    "explicit formulae for orthogonal polynomials were not derived in @xcite but can be deduced from their proof .",
    "one strong motivation for deriving the asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials comes from random matrix theory .",
    "indeed , the laguerre - type weights ( [ weight ] ) are related to random matrix ensembles used in the statistical description of mesoscopic quantum systems with disorder .",
    "depending on the symmetries of the physical system one distinguishes ten different classes of ensembles , see for example @xcite and references therein . besides the three standard classes ( orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ) there are seven novel classes , which have been introduced by physicists during the past ten years . in the gaussian case the joint probability distribution of the positive eigenvalues @xmath31",
    "can be written in the following form for all the seven novel symmetry classes , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a normalization constant .",

    "we replace the term @xmath39 in ( [ probability distribution ej ] ) by @xmath40 where @xmath3 denotes a polynomial of the form ( [ definition : q ] ) .",
    "a simple transformation @xmath41 then leads to the following probability density function , @xmath42 it is a beautiful and important observation ( see for example @xcite ) in random matrix theory that for @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is constructed out of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , all related statistical quantities of interest can be expressed in terms of @xmath45 .",
    "using our results on the asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials we will prove in this paper that for @xmath43 the local eigenvalue statistics have universal behavior ( as @xmath18 ) in different regimes of the spectrum . by _",
    "universal _ we mean that the behavior is independent of @xmath3 as long as @xmath3 is chosen to be a polynomial . in work in progress , together with deift , gioev and kriecherbauer @xcite , we will use the results of this paper , together with the approach developed in @xcite , to prove universality for @xmath47 .    in order to get our results ,",

    "we have to do a local analysis using bessel functions .",

    "we state the rh problem for orthogonal polynomials and apply the deift - zhou steepest descent method to analyze the rh problem asymptotically .",
    "afterwards , we use the asymptotics of the solution of this rh problem to determine the asymptotics of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 ( in section 4 ) , to determine the plancherel - rotach type asymptotics for @xmath14 ( in section 5 ) , and to prove universality results in random matrix theory ( in section 6 ) .",
    "it is well - known in the theory of orthogonal polynomials that there are two ingredients needed for the asymptotic ( as @xmath18 ) description .",
