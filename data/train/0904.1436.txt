    "in this note the problem of vortices in thin superconducting films is revisited .",
    "useful formulae for the interaction between vortices in thin superconducting films within london theory are given when the film thickness @xmath0 is smaller than the london penetration depth @xmath1 .",
    "in such thin films the vortex interaction is mediated mainly by the magnetic stray field , and the screening of the in - plane supercurrents is governed by the effective 2-dimensional ( 2d ) penetration depth @xmath2 .",
    "the current density @xmath3 in thin films is nearly independent of the @xmath4 coordinate ( perpendicular to the film ) and the sheet current in the film is thus @xmath5 .",
    "the sheet current of a vortex in such a thin film and the interaction force between two vortices was calculated first by judea pearl @xcite for an infinitely large film . for infinite films of arbitrary thickness",
    "the pearl - london vortex and the vortex - vortex interaction were calculated analytically , @xcite and the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory for periodic vortex lattices in such films with arbitrary gl parameter @xmath6 in the entire range of inductions @xmath7 was computed in ref .  .    for superconductors of finite size , recently there have been numerous computations based on the static or time - dependent gl equations for small ( mesoscopic ) specimens containing a few vortices , also giant vortices with several flux quanta , and considering the equilibrium state or the penetration , exit , nucleation , and annihilation of vortices .",
    "for example , superconducting disks are considered in ref .  , squares and other shapes in ref .  , also squares containing magnetic dots @xcite or antidots or blind holes @xcite as pinning centers , and disks in inhomogeneous magnetic field.@xcite when the 2d penetration depth @xmath8 is much larger than the film size , the energy of the magnetic stray field outside the specimen is expected to be negligible and analytical approximations can be made.@xcite further work computes the properties of infinitely long straight vortices in semi - infinite @xcite or cylindrical @xcite samples and argues that these results apply also to thin films in a perpendicular field in cases when the magnetic stray - field energy outside the film may be disregarded .    the present paper focusses on situations when the stray - field energy is not negligible , e.g. , since @xmath9 is smaller than the film size , and it is restricted to the london limit in which the superconducting coherence length @xmath10 and vortex core radius @xmath11 are much smaller than the film size and than @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "ii we first consider the limit of ideal screening ( @xmath12 ) when the sheet current and energy of vortices are completely determined by the stray field and can be derived easily for an _ infinite _ film .",
    "introduction of a finite @xmath9 then leads to pearl vortices , whose interaction is discussed in some detail in sec .",
    "ii - v and in appendix a. finally , in sec .",
    "vi vortices and their interaction in films of _ finite size _ are presented , computed by a method @xcite that applies to thin flat films of any size and shape and to any @xmath9 . as a main result in sec .",
    "vii it will be shown that the sheet current and interaction of vortices in films of finite size differ considerably from the ideal pearl result .",
    "as expected , this deviation is most pronounced near the film edges , where the real interaction _ potential _ vanishes while the interaction _ force _ is peaked .",
    "but less expectedly , this deviation is considerable even when the interacting vortex pair is located far from the film edges , e.g. , near the center of a square film : the real interaction with a central vortex is reduced from its pearl value by a factor which decreases approximately linearly from unity to zero as one goes from the central vortex towards the edge , see fig .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "the thin - film problem differs from the behavior of currents and vortices in bulk superconductors by the dominating role of the magnetic stray field outside the film .",
    "the interaction between vortices occurs mainly by this stray field and thus has very long range ( interacting over the entire film width ) , while in bulk superconductors the vortex currents and the vortex interaction are screened and thus decrease exponentially over the length @xmath1 .",
    "the long - range currents and forces can be shown for the ideal screening limit of zero @xmath1 as follows .",
    "consider one vortex in the center of a large circular film with radius @xmath13 . on length scales",
    "larger than @xmath1 this point vortex behaves like a magnetic dipole , composed of two magnetic monopoles : one sends magnetic flux @xmath14 into the space above the film and one receives the same flux from the lower half space . here",
    "tm@xmath16 is the quantum of magnetic flux .",
    "the magnetic field lines of this point - vortex are straight radial lines , all passing through this point .",
    "the magnitude of this magnetic stray field is @xmath17 above and @xmath18 below the film , since the flux @xmath14 has to pass through the shell of any half sphere of 3d radius @xmath19 and surface area @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the 2d radius in the film plane @xmath22 . directly above and below the film plane",
    "the stray field has the same magnitude @xmath23 but has opposite sign .",
    "this jump of the magnetic field component parallel to the film is caused by a sheet current that circulates around the vortex and equals this field difference in size , @xmath24 .",
    "this current thus decreases very slowly with radius @xmath25 .",
    "the force @xmath26 between this central vortex and a second vortex at a distance @xmath25 is radial ( central force ) and repulsive and in size equals just this sheet current @xmath27 times the flux quantum @xmath14 , @xmath28 the interaction potential @xmath29 between these two point vortices ( pearl vortices ) follows from its derivative @xmath30 and the definition @xmath31 , @xmath32 note that this result does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "it applies also for finite @xmath9 if the distance is large , @xmath33 .",
    "the general results for arbitrary @xmath9 can be derived from the expression for the interaction potential noting that still @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",

    "the final result for the curvature in this limit is then @xmath105",
    "the spring constant ( 14 ) may be calculated also from the elasticity theory of the vortex lattice , @xcite see appendix a. in this case one requires nonlocal elasticity with a dispersive compressional modulus @xmath106 .",

    "interestingly , for the 2d lattice of pearl vortices in thin films the same moduli @xmath221 , @xmath108 , eq .",
    "( a1 ) , apply ( referred to unit volume ) .",
    "namely , in the limit of thin films with thickness @xmath231 in the london limit @xmath232 one has @xcite for the moduli per unit area @xmath233 ( for @xmath234 ) and @xmath235 .",
    "thus , the below results apply both to the lattice of parallel abrikosov vortices with length @xmath236 and to thin films with thickness @xmath231 .",
    "we introduce the vortex displacements @xmath237 and their fourier transforms @xmath238 $ ] , @xmath239 here @xmath240 is the vortex density and the @xmath72 integral is over the first brillouin zone ( bz ) with area @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the radius of the circle that may be used to approximate the hexagonal bz . at the maximum @xmath243 one",
    "has @xmath244 .",
    "the elastic energy per unit area ( hence the factor @xmath0 ) is @xmath245 in it @xmath246 with @xmath247 is the elastic matrix , @xmath248 with @xmath249 .",
    "explicitly one has @xmath250 the determinant of @xmath246 is @xmath251 , and the inverse matrix has the elements @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 .",
    "we shall now apply this formalism to two problems .",
    "first , we consider the problem of eq .",
    "( 12 ) : all vortices are rigidly pinned but the free vortex at the origin is shifted by a distance @xmath116 along @xmath77 , thus @xmath255 . inserting this into ( a2 )",
    "yields @xmath256 and the elastic energy ( a3 ) becomes @xmath257 since @xmath258 one has from eqs .",
    "( a1 ) and ( a4 ) @xmath259 .",
    "averaging @xmath260 over the angle @xmath261 yields @xmath262 . with the bz area",
    "@xmath263 we thus obtain the potential curvature @xmath264 this coincides with eq .",
    "( 14 ) .",
    "second , we consider the case when all vortices in a cylinder or disk with radius @xmath110 can move freely , only the vortices at the surface or edge @xmath265 are pinned to ensure zero displacement there .",
    "we calculate the elastic force @xmath115 that is required to move the central vortex a distance @xmath116 , thereby deforming the vortex lattice .",
    "thus , the applied forces on the vortices are all zero except for the force acting on the central vortex , @xmath266 . in general",
    ", we define the forces @xmath267 per unit length ( the total force on the @xmath268th vortex of length @xmath0 is @xmath269 ) and their fourier transform @xmath270 $ ] by @xmath271 the elastic energy ( a3 ) may also be written as @xmath272 displacements and forces are related by @xmath273 for our example @xmath266 one has @xmath274 and the elastic energy becomes , with @xmath275 , @xmath276 for the @xmath72 integral we have used a lower cut - off @xmath277 and the upper limit @xmath278 .",
    "the curvature of the elastic potential , @xmath107 , that the vortex at the origin feels is defined by @xmath279 since the central force is @xmath280 , i.e. , @xmath107 is a spring constant . comparing eqs .",
    "( a10 ) and ( a11 ) and using the shear modulus ( a1 ) we obtain @xmath281 thus , when the surrounding vortices are allowed to relax elastically , the displacement of the central vortex , on which a force acts , is increased by a factor @xmath282 .",
