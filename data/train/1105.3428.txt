    "one important goal of modern liquid - crystal research is to enhance the properties of liquid crystals through _ physical _ methods , without the need for new chemical synthesis .",

    "if the particles have a length scale of 10100 nm , they are too small to distort the liquid crystal . in that case",
    ", the system enters into another regime of behavior , in which the particles function as molecular additives to change the effective properties of the liquid - crystal host .",
    "one particularly interesting case occurs if the particles are _",
    "ferroelectric_. experiments have shown that low concentrations of ferroelectric sn@xmath0p@xmath0s@xmath1 or batio@xmath2 nanoparticles increase the orientational order parameter , increase the isotropic - nematic transition temperature , and decrease the switching voltage for the frederiks transition  .",
    "thus , they provide a new opportunity to enhance the properties of liquid crystals for technological applications .    to make further progress with these materials , it is essential to develop a theory for the interaction between liquid crystals and ferroelectric nanoparticles . in previous theoretical research ,",
    "reshetnyak _ et al .",
    "_ have developed a theoretical approach based on electrostatics  @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the key issue is how an ensemble of nanoparticles with aligned dipole moments can polarize the liquid - crystal molecules , hence increasing the intermolecular interaction .",
    "this electrostatic effect enhances the isotropic - nematic transition temperature and reduces the frederiks transition voltage . in related research , pereira _ et al . _",
    "have performed molecular dynamics simulations of ferroelectric nanoparticles immersed in a nematic liquid crystal  @xcite .",
    "these simulations also assume that the nanoparticles are aligned , and they also find a substantial enhancement of liquid - crystal order .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , we proposed a different type of theory for the statistical mechanics of ferroelectric nanoparticles in liquid crystals .",
    "in that theory , we suppose that _ both _ the liquid crystals and the nanoparticles have distributions of orientations , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "these distributions are characterized by two orientational order parameters , which interact with each other . using a landau theory",
    ", we showed that the coupling stabilizes the nematic phase . by estimating the strength of the coupling",
    ", we calculated the enhancement in the isotropic - nematic transition temperature .",
    "we also predicted that the nanoparticles would greatly increase the kerr effect , the response of the isotropic phase to an applied electric field .",
    "although the work of ref .  @xcite demonstrates an important physical mechanism , we must acknowledge that it has one mathematical limitation : like all landau theories , it involves an expansion of the free energy in powers of the order parameters .",
    "this expansion is valid when the order parameters are small , but it breaks down when they become large . in particular , the theory allows the order parameters to become larger than 1 , which is clearly impossible . for ferroelectric nanoparticles in a liquid crystal ,",
    "the nanoparticle order parameter is not necessarily small , even near the isotropic - nematic transition .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to generalize the previous theory by eliminating the assumption that the order parameters are small . for this generalization",
    ", we now use a maier - saupe - type theory instead of a landau theory .",
    "we still consider the same physical concept of coupled orientational order parameters for the liquid crystals and the nanoparticles , and we still use the same energy of interaction between them .",
    "however , we now use a more general expression for the entropy , not a power series , which enforces the constraint that the order parameters can not become larger than 1 .",
    "this change allows us to avoid the potential mathematical inconsistency of landau theory .    like our previous calculation",
    ", the work presented here shows that doping liquid crystals with ferroelectric nanoparticles enhances the isotropic - nematic transition temperature . in the limit of weak coupling between the nanoparticles and the liquid crystal",
    ", the maier - saupe - type theory exactly reduces to the landau theory .",
    "however , in the case of strong coupling , the new theory predicts a smaller but still substantial enhancement .",
    "rough estimates suggest that the experimental system is in the limit of strong coupling , so it is important to use this modified theory .",
    "furthermore , the work presented here also predicts the kerr effect as a function of applied electric field . in the limit of low electric field , the maier - saupe - type theory exactly reduces to the landau theory .",
    "however , for larger field , the nanoparticle order saturates and the enhanced kerr effect is cut off .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the formalism of maier - saupe theory , with interacting orientational distributions for liquid - crystal molecules and nanoparticles . in sec .",
    "iii we apply this formalism to calculate the isotropic - nematic transition temperature , and determine the enhancement due to nanoparticles . in sec .",
    "iv we use the same formalism to calculate the kerr effect of induced orientational order under an applied electric field , and investigate how this effect depends on the magnitude of the field .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "v we discuss the main conclusions of this study .",
    "in this section we introduce the free energy for a system of liquid - crystal molecules with ferroelectric nanoparticles . to construct the free energy , we use the fundamental equation of mean - field theory , @xmath3 where the first term is the energy , the second term is the entropic contribution to the free energy , and the averages are taken over the single - particle distribution function @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the first step is to define the distribution functions for liquid - crystal molecules and nanoparticles .",
    "liquid - crystal molecules are rod - shaped objects , with each molecule characterized by the direction of its long axis @xmath5 . in the nematic phase ,",
    "these axes are preferentially oriented along the average director @xmath6 . because the individual molecules are equally likely to point along @xmath7 or @xmath8 , the single - molecule distribution function can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angle between the molecular orientation @xmath5 and the average director @xmath6 , and @xmath11 is the second legendre polynomial . the parameter @xmath12 is a variational parameter , which acts as an effective field on the molecular orientation .",

    "the average interaction energy becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of liquid - crystal molecules in the system , and @xmath22 is an energetic parameter proportional to the interaction strength and the number of neighbors per molecule .",

    "( [ tnij ] ) or  ( [ tstar ] ) to determine @xmath22 for that material , @xmath32    once we add nanoparticles to the system , we get another distribution function for the orientations of the nanoparticle dipole moments . by symmetry , we expect that this distribution should be aligned along the same axis @xmath6 as the liquid - crystal distribution",
    ". however , the magnitude of the order may be different .",

    "our current estimate is different from our previous paper  @xcite , where we assumed @xmath92 cm@xmath79 because of an understanding that the bulk polarization is reduced by surface effects in nanoparticles .",
    "the issue of estimating the polarization of nanoparticles is subtle , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a final point about the phase diagram , we should mention that the model defined by the free energy  ( [ freeenergy ] ) can exhibit one additional phase , between isotropic and nematic , which occurs if the parameter @xmath41 is sufficiently large . in this intermediate phase ,",
    "the nanoparticles have substantial orientational order ( with @xmath35 comparable to the maier - saupe order parameter of 0.429 ) , but the liquid crystal has only very slight orientational order ( with @xmath16 of order @xmath93 ) .",
    "for that reason , we might call it a `` semi - nematic '' phase .",
    "it is a perturbation on the pure liquid crystal s isotropic phase , not on the nematic phase .",
    "the semi - nematic phase is probably an artifact of the mean - field theory used here .",
    "it can only exist because the very slight order of the liquid crystal mediates an aligning interaction between the nanoparticles .",
    "this slight orientational order is unlikely to persist when one includes fluctuations in the liquid crystal .",
    "apart from the phase diagram , another important issue is the response of a liquid crystal to an applied electric field . in the isotropic phase ,",
    "an applied field @xmath94 induces orientational order proportional to @xmath95 , known as the kerr effect . in most pure liquid crystals ,",
    "the kerr effect is quite small , and can only be observed for very large fields .",
