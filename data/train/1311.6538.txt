    "@xcite the so - called spin - peierls ( sp ) transition leads to the formation of local magnetic singlets with a spin gap @xmath4 as a consequence of alternating structural distortions between neighboring spins .",
    "experimental fingerprints of this transition are usually the appearance of comparably weak superstructure reflections in structural investigation methods due to a doubling of the unit cell , as well as a drop of the magnetic susceptibility due to the formation of a singlet ground state with a gap @xmath4 to energetically higher triplet excitations .",
    "a crossover from well defined singlet and triplet bound states of dimerized phases to spinon excitations in the homogeneous state can be observed as a function of temperature or competing magnetic interactions .",

    "@xcite later , tio__x _ _ ( _ x _ = br , cl ) has been found to represent a more complex case of dimer formation .",
    "@xcite this is due to the existence of an extended intermediate fluctuation regime for @xmath6 , leading to a decoupling of @xmath4 from @xmath7 with a ratio of @xmath8 , i.e. far beyond a bcs - like , mean - field model .",
    "for tiocl the fluctuation regime has been attributed to comparably large , frustrated interchain interactions .",
    "@xcite however , speculations about the role of orbital excitations in destabilizing the lattice dimerization and possible high temperature superconductivity have been made .",
    "@xcite    recently , law _",

    "similar to tio__x _ _ , two successive phase transitions were found from magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements at @xmath18 k and @xmath9 k. while the latter is due to a sp - like instability , the first one signals the transition from a uniform to an incommensurate dimerized spin chain .",

    "@xcite nonetheless , neutron powder diffraction studies of the crystal structure reveal no apparent evidence for a structural phase transition as function of temperature .",
    "@xcite this highlights an apparent contradiction between the subtle nature of structural distortions and the relatively high sp transition temperature , which implies a strong spin - lattice interaction .",
    "similarly , a strong deviation of the ratio @xmath20 from the bcs - like value points toward other non - magnetoelastic contributions to the sp mechanism .    here , we report results of inelastic light scattering ( raman scattering ) in tipo@xmath1 , showing pronounced anomalies in phonon as well as magnetic scattering . from magnetic raman scattering",
    "we can extract an antiferromagnetic intrachain coupling of @xmath21 k in the sp phase , which is considerably lower than the value of the high temperature phase .",

    "7 we illustrate the calculated electron density distribution for the orbital ground state in the sp phase . the appearance of the new @xmath80 orbital order can explain an unusual expansion of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 lattice parameters with decreasing temperatures which is most pronounced between @xmath33 and @xmath7 and becomes static below @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    taking the orbital reordering process into account , we can qualitatively explain the discrepancy between the intrachain exchange coupling extracted from magnetic raman scattering in the sp phase and from magnetic susceptibility in the high temperature phase .",
    "in accordance with goodenough - kanamori rules , the orbital alternation from @xmath116-type into @xmath80-type ( shown in fig .",
    "7 ) drastically decreases the magnitude of intrachain exchange interaction in the sp - phase compared to the high temperature phase .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the topology of the electron lobes in the isotropic chain phase would support a direct exchange between ti - ti ions instead of a superexchange , as the lobes reach from metal to metal , past neighboring oxygens .",
    "this question is highly debated , owing to the anomalously large value of intrachain exchange interaction in tio@xmath126 ( @xmath126 = cl , br ) compounds .",
    "@xcite    the symmetry of the first excited crystal field level changes in the opposite way than the symmetry of the ground state level for all cases considered above . for the @xmath116 , @xmath121-type ground state",
    "the first excited level is of @xmath119 , @xmath80-type symmetry and vice versa . in the following",
    "we will discuss possible reasons for this unusual reverse order ( @xmath116 instead of @xmath119 symmetry ) of the lowest crystal field level in the tio@xmath10 octahedra as well as the source of orbital instability .",
    "in tipo@xmath1 the po@xmath1 tetrahedron is the most rigid unit with a high covalence of the p - o bonds .",
    "therefore , the tio@xmath10 octahedra are secondary units with highly distorted `` metal - ligand '' bonds compared to their equilibrium values , which can be estimated from the shannon radii .",
    "indeed , a closer look at the high temperature structure reveals that the length of the ti - o bonds along the @xmath47-direction is compressed compared to the ti - o bonds within the @xmath127-plane .",
    "therefore , in first approximation the symmetry of the crystal field forces the ti@xmath14 electron density into the @xmath127-plane .",
    "the lobes of this density distribution should be pointing in between the four oxygen ions of the @xmath127-plane ( see upper panel of fig .",
    "thus , we obtain an @xmath120 @xmath121 orbital ground state instead of the expected @xmath119 @xmath128 for an octahedral environment .",
    "the strength of crystal field increases as the lattice contracts under lowering the temperature and the influence of oxygen ions situated in the @xmath127-plane leads to a reordered orbital ground state into the @xmath44-plane ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "the accidental degeneracy of crystal field levels has also some dynamical aspect .",
    "calculations of the adiabatic potential for ti ions along the @xmath11-axis ( not shown ) show that for @xmath78 larger than a critical value this potential has a minimum at the center of the octahedra .",
    "however , under approaching the critical value the depth of the adiabatic potential decreases and it becomes more shallow . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the adiabatic potential acquires a double well shape so that the energy minimum is reached at a certain off - centering of the ti ions .",
    "thus , the accidental degeneracy leads to a jahn - teller like instability which is removed by shifting ti ions along the crystallographic @xmath11-axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic subsystem prevents a cooperative jahn - teller distortion with an equidistant distribution of ti ions .",
    "instead , the magnetoelastic interaction , acting against the coulomb repulsion , generates ti dimers .",
    "one can conclude that the interplay of the orbital and the magnetic subsystems as well as the orbital instability highly enforces the sp transition , leading to an enhanced @xmath7 , much larger than expected from a purely magnetoelastic mechanism .",
    "similarly , the spin gap also increases anomalously as for the closing of the gap one should spend energy against two subsystems , @xmath23 ) the magnetic exchange coupling and @xmath26 ) the reordered orbital ground state .    the mode around 3430 @xmath51 depicted in fig .",
    "8 is too high in energy for phonon or magnetic scattering processes .",
    "a good candidate could be a crystal field excitation . from theoretical calculations , a crystal field excitation energy of 3400 @xmath51 for the transition from the ti@xmath14 @xmath80 to the @xmath129 level",
    "is found in the sp phase at reasonable @xmath78 values and ti off - centering shifts ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "furthermore , its energy is of the same order of magnitude as the lowest titanium crystal field onsite excitation observed in tiocl by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "@xcite however , a strong modification of this signal with temperature , as shown in fig . 8 , is unexpected . on the other hand ,",
    "a jump in frequency under a first order phase transiton at @xmath7 is characteristic for a one - particle scattering process .",
    "note , that such a sensitivity to the lattice distortions can not be observed for two - magnon scattering or for any composite , two - particle processes as they are integrated over the brillouin zone .",
    "it is also noteworthy that this mode is only observed in @xmath49 polarization , i.e. with the light polarization parallel to the spin chains .",
    "no signal could be detected in either crossed or perpendicular polarization .",
    "additionally , a change in laser line from @xmath31 nm to 561 nm had no influence on the mode s energy or the line shape , proving its intrinsic nature in a raman scattering process . besides the strong mode at 3430 @xmath51 , weaker shoulders",
    "are observed above 3540 @xmath51 , which mimic the temperature and polarization behavior of the former mode .",
    "the energy difference between the first shoulder and the main mode corresponds to typical vibrational energies of ti ions .",
    "@xcite this points toward very strong coupling between the crystal field excitation and ti phonons . respectively",
    ", a two - particle process consisting of a phononic and a crystal field excitation can account well for the observed maximum , i.e. the simultaneous scattering with @xmath130 to a flat dispersion regime for one excitation and with @xmath131 of the same magnitude to a flat dispersion regime of a second excitation .",
    "such a scattering process is schematically sketched in the inset of fig .",
    "all of these observations support the scenario of a sp transition with a strong amplification by an orbital instability .",
    "another noteworthy anomaly is the large increase of linewidth with temperature of the mode around 3430 @xmath51 above @xmath7 , i.e. , when the system enters the incommensurate phase . as illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 the energy of the first crystal field excitation has a very steep slope as function of @xmath78 , so that minute changes of the covalency degree lead to a large variation of the energy .",
    "furthermore , the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 shows that a much stronger energy variation takes place for modest off - centering shifts of the ti ions .",
    "note , that in between @xmath7 and @xmath33 the adiabatic potential changes its shape along the chain direction from a two - minimum to a one - minimum form .",
    "thus , the thermal off - centering fluctuations are much larger in the incommensurate phase . consequently ,",
    "at @xmath6 the dynamical ( i.e. thermal ) variation of the crystal field excitation energy that effectively manifests itself as an increase in linewidth , is much larger than the natural width .",
    "this dynamical width should follow the amplitude behavior of the thermal off - centering fluctuations with temperature proportional to @xmath132 as is observed from experiment ( see the orange fit curve to the linewidth in the right panel of fig . 8) .",
    "the orbital instability due to an off - centering dimerization shift of the ti ions implies that the tio@xmath10 octahedral complex can be easily polarized along the @xmath11-direction .",
    "therefore , not only the first crystal field excitation but also the ti phonon modes which oscillate along the @xmath11-axis should gain in raman scattering intensity in @xmath49-polarization . based on this",
    "we attribute two modes at 132 @xmath51 and at 166 @xmath51 to the phonon modes with predominantly contribution from ti off - centering vibrations .",
    "these phonon modes should evidence strong coupling to the first crystal field excitation which is indeed observed as exciton - phonon shoulder around 3540 @xmath51 .",
    "also these phonon modes strongly modulate the magnetic intrachain exchange that is seen as characteristic fano - like line shape .",
    "the asymmetry decreases with temperature , i.e. , with the decrease of the modulation amplitude .    in conclusion",
    ", we suggest that the ti orbital degrees of freedom play an essential role in the dimerization process in tipo@xmath1 as their energies are comparable to the energy of the magnetic and lattice subsystems in a certain temperature regime . furthermore , the orbital instability highly enforces the sp transition by amplifying the value of the spin gap .",
    "this situation is completely different in the more conventional sp compound cugeo@xmath5 . comparing the observed effects to tiocl and tiobr ,",
    "it is evident that with respect to the reduced gap ratio as well as to the magnitude of the phonon anomalies the two latter compounds behave even more exotically .",
    "the clear identification of mixed orbital - lattice - spin excitations in the rather one - dimensional tipo@xmath1 would then allow to assign the previously identified magnetic scattering in tiocl and tiobr at least to a certain degree to mixed excitation processes .",
    "to some extent this clears up the previously unsolved discrepancy of their similar energies despite reasonably different exchange coupling constants .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive raman scattering study of the 1d spin chain system tipo@xmath1 .",
    "this system undergoes a complex dimerization process from a uniform to an incommensurate to a commensurate phase . in the incommensurate phase unusual lattice dynamics",
    "is observed which can be ascribed to strong spin - orbital - phonon coupling .",
    "the magnetic scattering that shows a pronounced renormalization within this process can be separated into a bosonic low and a fermionic high energy part . from the low energy regime",
    "we extract the size of the rather large spin gap @xmath101 k , which points to a contribution of orbital degrees of freedom to the energy gain in the dimerized phase .",
    "in contrast to other sp systems , a significant amount of undimerized spins remain in tipo@xmath1 below the sp transition temperature , as evidenced by a considerable spectral weight below the spin gap energy .",
    "furthermore , a mode at high energies with a distinct temperature and polarization dependence is attributed to a crystal field excitation of mixed orbital and lattice nature .",
    "we find a huge difference between the value of intrachain exchange interaction extracted from the cut - off magnetic raman scattering in the sp phase for @xmath77 and from the magnetic susceptibility measured for @xmath6 .",
    "we attribute this difference to a different orbital order in tipo@xmath1 at high and at low temperatures .",
    "our modified crystal field cluster calculations support this conclusion .",
    "we show that orbital instability develops in the incommensurate phase .",
    "the accidental degeneracy of crystal field levels and orbital instability is removed by the sp dimerization process at which strong magnetoelastic coupling acts against the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we uncover an exotic dimerization process different from other sp materials in which the spin gap energy gain is formed by magnetoelastic and orbital mechanisms .",
    "our study highlights the peculiar nature of tipo@xmath1 , which reaches far beyond a conventional sp picture .",
