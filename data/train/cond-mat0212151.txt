    "a _ liquid ball _ is a drop which remains quasi - spherical when brought into contact with a solid surface",
    ".  different examples of such objects have recently been described : let us quote _ pearl drops _ , which result from the extreme hydrophobicity of the solid @xcite , _ liquid marbles _",
    ", achieved by texturing the surface of the liquid @xcite , and ( more classically ) _ leidenfrost drops _ , obtained by putting a small amount of volatile liquid on a very hot plate @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "quick transportation of tiny amounts of liquid becomes possible without any leak , which can be of great interest in microfluidics applications . at the same time these systems realize pure  capillary `` devices , '' and are worth being studied for their original properties .",
    "for example , a liquid ball ( with a typical diameter 1 mm ) impinging onto a solid substrate bounces off , as if it were a tennis ball hitting the ground @xcite .",
    "the rebounds are persistent ( the restitution coefficient can be very high , of the order of 0.9 ) , and observed in a large window of impact velocity .",
    "if the velocity is too small ( typically smaller than a few centimeters per second ) , the drop gets stuck on the substrate .",
    "if too large ( above around 1 m / s ) , the drop endures extreme deformation during the shock , and finally breaks into several pieces . in between , a more detailed analysis of the shock itself shows that the contact time of the drop with the substrate does not depend on the impact velocity @xmath0 over a large interval of velocity @xcite .    in this note , we discuss the maximal deformation of this sort of `` water spring , '' and also the value of the contact time during the shock , in particular in the limit of elastic impact ( small impact velocity ) .",
    "these predictions are compared with original experimental data .",
    "we shall mainly focus on the limit of small deformations where a drop of initial radius @xmath1 bounces back with a high restitution coefficient of the order of 0.9 .",
    "this corresponds to kinetic energies smaller than surface energies , _",
    "i.e. _ to small weber numbers , where the latter quantity is defined as @xmath2 this condition is achieved for small impact velocities , _",
    "i.e. _ smaller than @xmath3 : @xmath4 for a millimetric water drop ( @xmath5 mn / m@xmath6",
    "kg / m@xmath7 ) , @xmath3 is of the order of 1 m / s . as seen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the drop at its maximal deformation looks like a flattened sphere for small impact velocities ( @xmath8 ) , or a pancake for larger velocities ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "mm , @xmath10 m / s , @xmath11 ) ; or at a larger velocity ( b : @xmath12 mm , @xmath13 m / s , @xmath14 ) . ]",
    "we start from the euler s equation:@xmath16 neglecting the effect of viscosity thanks to the high restitution coefficient .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath15 , in which the drop is deformed by a quantity @xmath17 much smaller than the initial radius @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1].a ) ; the characteristic time of deformation scales as @xmath18 . on the other hand , the laplace pressure gradient scales as @xmath19 ( for example , assuming an ellipsoidal form for the drop , the pressure jump at the equator or the apex scales as @xmath20 and changes over the length @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ euler ] )",
    "can be dimensionally written as@xmath21 this equation also expresses the transfer of kinetic energy into the surface and gravitational terms associated with the drop deformation .",
    "if the velocity is zero , the drop is deformed by gravity by a quantity @xmath22 , as first discussed by mahadevan and pomeau @xcite , which reads @xmath23 by use of the capillary length @xmath24 , which is about 3 mm for water .",
    "we first consider the case where capillarity dominates gravity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "then , we find from eq .",
    "( [ ec2 ] ) that the maximal deformation scales as the velocity:@xmath26 the contact time should be of the order of @xmath27 and thus can be written as@xmath28 eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , which yields a @xmath0-independent contact time of about one millisecond , indeed corresponds to the plateau observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) allows us to make clear the limit of this regime .",
    "since @xmath17 must be larger than @xmath22 , we find that the velocity must be larger than a characteristic velocity,@xmath29 which is about a few cm / s .",
    "if @xmath0 approaches @xmath30 , gravity can not be neglected any more ; we recast eq .",
    "( [ ec2 ] ) as@xmath31 which expresses the energy conservation of an _ imaginary _ spring - mass system of initial velocity @xmath0 and initial elongation @xmath22 .",
    "is plotted as a function of time @xmath32 .",
    "the circle ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to the moment of impact and the square to the maximal deformation .",
    "the star thus indicates the moment of rebound .",
    "( a ) general case .",
    "( b ) small velocity limit .",
    "( c ) large velocity limit . ]",
    "[ f2 ] may help to have an intuitive picture for eq .",
    "( [ spring ] ) .",
    "the elongation @xmath34 of the imaginary spring is plotted as a function of time @xmath32 , setting @xmath33 at the moment of impact . the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ spring ] ) is represented by a circle ( @xmath35 @xmath36 at @xmath33 ) while the right - hand side by a square ( @xmath37 at @xmath38 ) .",
    "the moment of taking off is marked by a star , and @xmath39 is compared in the plot with the period of the oscillator @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we can graphically deduce the contact time @xmath39 . in the small velocity limit @xmath41 ( @xmath42 )",
    ", we see in fig .",
    "[ f2].b that the contact time @xmath39 is equal to the vibration period @xmath43 in contrast , in the interval commented above ( @xmath44 ) and with increase in @xmath0 , @xmath39 decreases from @xmath45 and approaches the plateau value @xmath46 .",
    "the complete variation of the contact time @xmath39 as a function of the impact velocity @xmath0 will be calculated more precisely in the next section .",
    "note finally that , as stated above , the maximal deformation , in the limit of extremely small impact velocities , tends towards the constant @xmath22 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ spring ] ) : we logically recover the static deformation .",
    "the previous scaling arguments can be completed by considering local flows during the impact .",
    "we start from the incompressibility condition ( @xmath47 ) , which reduces to@xmath48 in the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath49 ) with @xmath50 . looking for a solution of the type @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfying appropriate boundary conditions , and introducing the equatorial radius @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1].b ) , we find@xmath54 setting @xmath55 at the substrate surface .",
    "the velocity potential @xmath56 defined by @xmath57 can thus be written as @xmath58 if the viscosity is neglected , the dynamics of @xmath56 is governed by bernoulli s equation : @xmath59 here , the pressure @xmath60 at the surface of the drop is given by the laplace pressure , i.e. @xmath61 where the local curvature is denoted @xmath62 .",
    "we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ bern ] ) at the apex ( @xmath63 @xmath64 ) and at the equator ( @xmath65 @xmath66 ) , in the limit of small deformation ( @xmath67 ) for which @xmath68 .",
    "( here , @xmath34 is defined as in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] but not necessarily at its maximal deformation ; the maximum magnitude of @xmath34 is @xmath17 . ) to estimate the curvature difference @xmath69 , we take the value in the static limit since we are in the regime of small velocities ; the condition of constant pressure inside the drop can be integrated numerically , which gives @xmath70 . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath71 writing @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( which gives as a plateau value for the contact time @xmath74 ) , we find a general solution:@xmath75 the initial conditions lead to the relations @xmath76 and @xmath77 , from which we get @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the time of rebound @xmath39 should be given by the equation , @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "hence , we find @xmath82 with @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) or@xmath85 where@xmath86 the analytical result eq .",
    "( [ analytical ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , and allows us to recover the predictions made _ via _ fig . [ f2 ] : the contact time decreases by a factor 2 when the impact velocity is increased from about @xmath30 to @xmath3 .",
    "we measured the contact time of bouncing drops at small impact velocities for millimetric water droplets hitting a super - hydrophobic substrate .",
    "rebounds were sequentially recorded with a high - speed camera with a typical sampling time of 10@xmath87 s for a contact time around 10@xmath88 s , which gives a precision higher than 10 % .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f4 ]  for two drop sizes .",
    "we indeed observed that the contact time significantly increases at low impact velocity ( in the range below 10 cm / s ) .",
    "in addition , the ratio between the largest and the shortest times is found to be very close to 2 , for both sizes . finally , the velocity above which a plateau is observed increases with the drop size .",
    "all these observations are qualitatively in agreement with our predictions .",
    "a fully quantitative comparison would require a very accurate measurement of the drop radii ( which determine the value of @xmath30 ) , and also taking into account the possibility for the drop to stick at very small velocity : for @xmath89 , it is observed that the drop does not bounce off but remains stuck to the solid .",
    "in contrast , the comparison between the model and the data becomes quite precise at higher speeds : the plateau value is well described by eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) with a numerical coefficient of 2.6@xmath90 @xcite , in good agreement with 2.3 , the value obtained above .",
    "we also measured the maximal deformation @xmath17 of the drop during the impact as a function of the impact velocity @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) .",
    "we found a linear behavior , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "this first series of experiments confirms that the contact time of the bouncing drop deviates from its asymptotic value when we are in the regime of low impact velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ in the linear regime of deformation .",
    "we interpreted this effect as due to gravity , and tried to confirm this interpretation thanks to a second series of experiments .",
    "there , we studied the bouncing with gravity working in the opposite direction ( _ inverted gravity _ ) .",
    "drops were dropped from centimetric heights onto a super - hydrophobic substrate slightly tilted . after bouncing off",
    ", they hit at a height close to their maximum rebound height on a second plate of the same nature and inclined by the same angle .",
    "we recorded the contact time for rebounds on this second plate .",
    "the data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , as a function of the impact velocity .",
    "the error bars are there larger ( because of the experimental resolution and the effects due to the vibrations induced by the first impact ) , but the data clearly indicate that the contact time",
    "_ increases _ with the impact velocity .",
    "this is in agreement with our theory : transforming @xmath91 into @xmath92 ( equivalently , @xmath22 into @xmath93 ) in eq .",
    "( [ analytical ] ) makes @xmath39 increase with @xmath0 as plotted in dotted line in fig .",
    "interestingly , here , the contact time can vary between @xmath94 and @xmath39 ( between @xmath39 and 2@xmath39 in the previous experiments ) which can be understood qualitatively using the construction suggested in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . in the inverted gravity case ,",
    "the whole sequence takes place below the line @xmath95 , so that we recover that the contact time should vary between @xmath94 and @xmath39 .",
    "interesting perspectives can be given in the regime of higher impact velocities ( @xmath96 ) where the drop is highly deformed and makes some kind of ( transient ) pancake of radius @xmath97 and thickness @xmath98 ( fig .",
    "[ f1].b ) . since the drop crashes on the solid during a _ crashing time _",
    "@xmath99 , we expect the inertial term in the euler s equation to be of the order of @xmath100 .",
    "the laplace pressure scales as @xmath101 at the equator and it changes over the length @xmath98 .",
    "the pressure gradient thus scales as @xmath102 .",
    "the gravity term can be neglected in this regime of large deformation , so that the euler s equation can be cast dimensionally into@xmath103 _ via _ the conservation of the volume ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "thus , the maximal size of the pancake is deduced as@xmath105 where @xmath106 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ weber ] ) .",
    "@xmath17 is indeed found to be larger than @xmath1 for @xmath107 .",
    "we note that if the initial kinetic energy were transformed mainly into a surface term , namely , @xmath108 we would find @xmath109 instead of eq .",
    "( [ addlarge ] ) .",
    "( [ enrgcons2 ] ) is in striking contrast with the case of a small deformation where the kinetic energy was found to be stored in surface ( and gravitational ) energy during the shock as in eq .",
    "( [ ec2 ] ) .",
    "namely , eq . ( [ enrgcons2 ] ) tells us that the initial energy is transferred primarily into other forms , identities of which ( internal flow in the pancake , and possibly , the phonon energy of the substrate , etc . ) remains to be clarified .    in this regime",
    ", the contact time can be regarded as the dewetting time of the pancake . in this inertial case ,",
    "the dewetting velocity @xmath110 scales as @xmath111 @xcite , which corresponds to the retraction speed of a liquid sheet @xcite .",
    "thus , the contact time is given by @xmath112 , which happens to result in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the contact time was observed to be independent of @xmath0 and to increase as @xmath113 even for such high velocities @xcite .",
    "this fact emphasizes that the drop is no longer in a linear - spring regime , for which eq .",
    "( [ hypo ] ) would hold , and the contact time would be given by @xmath114 .",
    "note also that both @xmath115 and @xmath18 are certainly much longer than the crashing time @xmath99 in the present case ( @xmath116 ) , which justifies our previous estimation of the inertial term in eq .",
    "( [ enrgcons2 ] ) .",
    "in the limit of small deformations ( _ i.e. _ for small impact velocities ) , a liquid ball thrown on a solid behaves as a quasi - ideal spring .",
    "this can be understood as a conventional spring - mass system with a stiffness given by surface tension and a mass given by that of the ball ; the deformation of the small ball during the impact linearly depends on the impact velocity and the contact time scales as the period of this spring - mass system , as observed with high speed photographs .",
    "the contact time was found to _ increase _ ( typically by a factor of 2 ) at small impact velocity , which can be interpreted as the result of the weight of the ball .",
    "this was confirmed by achieving a similar experiment in an inverted field of gravity , which indeed leads to a _ decrease _ of the contact time at small velocities .    in this system ,",
    "the effect of viscosity could be ignored . this might be physically due to the absence of a contact line in a situation of non - wetting ; most of viscous dissipation usually takes place near the contact",
    ". it would be interesting to see how our views would be modified when the viscosity of the liquid consisting the ball is increased .",
    "extensions to similar ( but different ) systems such as gel balls @xcite or drops of surfactant solution would also be worth studying .",
