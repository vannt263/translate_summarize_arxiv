    "the overlap valence quark on @xmath10 flavor domain wall fermion ( dwf ) configurations has been used to calculate the strangeness and charmness in the nucleon  @xcite with high precision . due to the high degree of chiral symmetry of these fermions ,",
    "the calculation of the strangeness content is free of the problem of large mixing with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 matrix elements due to the additive renormalization of the quark mass that plagues the wilson fermions .",
    "in addition to having small @xmath13 discretization errors  @xcite , the overlap fermion that we use for the valence quarks in the nucleon can also be used for the light and charm quarks with small @xmath14 error  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to calculate the charmonium and charm - light mesons in addition to strangeness and charmness contents .",
    "the inversion of overlap fermions can be speeded up by using hyp smearing  @xcite and deflation with low eigenmodes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0qcd collaboration is determining charm and strange quark masses  @xciteand other physical quantities with the setup of overlap valence on dwf sea .",
    "the renormalization constants of quark bilinear operators needed to match lattice results to those in the continuum @xmath1 scheme are presented in this paper .",
    "non - perturbative renormalization is important in current lattice calculations aiming at percent level accuracy . as we know , the convergence of lattice perturbative calculations is often not satisfying and lattice perturbation series rarely extend beyond the one - loop level .",
    "we use the ri - mom scheme  @xcite to calculate renormalization constants for flavor non - singlet scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial vector operators @xmath15 , where @xmath16 respectively ( we will use @xmath17 to denote the four operators throughout this paper ) .",

    "a main source of systematic errors for @xmath22 comes from the truncation of the perturbative ratio from the ri - mom scheme to the @xmath1 scheme .",

    "the green functions needed to be computed include the quark propagator @xmath24 the forward green function @xmath25 and the vertex function @xmath26 the renormalization condition requires that the renormalized vertex function at a given scale @xmath27 coincides with its tree - level value .",

    "eq.([eq : ri_condition ] ) is defined in the quark massless limit so that ri - mom is a mass independent renormalization scheme . in practice , we do calculations at finite quark masses and then extrapolate to the chiral limit . for convenience ,",

    "@xcite , we shall use the renormalization of the axial - vector current to set the scale . since we can obtain the renormalization constant @xmath37 of the local axial vector current from ward identities , which equals to @xmath38 in the ri scheme",

    "the green functions in eq.([eq : ri_condition ] ) are not gauge invariant , therefore the calculation has to be done in a fixed gauge , usually in the landau gauge .",

    "we employ one hyp smearing on the gauge fields  @xcite and then fix to the landau gauge .",
    "the corresponding rotation matrices are saved .",
    "then the quark propagators in the landau gauge are rotated from those already computed before the gauge fixing to save time by avoiding doing inversions .",
    "the effects of smearing ( one or only a few iterations ) on observables go away in the continuum limit .",
    "also , note that hyp smearing and gauge rotation on a configuration commute .",
    "thus the effects in vertex functions of doing smearing before or after gauge fixing , or not doing smearing at all differ by discretization effects at a fixed lattice spacing . in tab .",
