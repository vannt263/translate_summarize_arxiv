    "mechanical , electromagnetic , and quantum - mechanical wave scattering share some remarkable universal features .",
    "a striking common characteristic among these fields is the optical theorem . the original idea behind it was to relate the optical index of refraction of a medium to what has been extinct in the scattering process  @xcite .",
    "for a traveling plane wave , the optical theorem states that the extinction cross - section , i.e. the time - averaged power extracted from the incident wave by scattering and absorption per incident intensity , is tantamount the forward scattering function .",
    "the theorem was initially stated for electromagnetic waves  @xcite . in quantum - mechanics , it was derived by feenberg  @xcite .",
    "the optical theorem was also established for a plane electromagnetic  @xcite , plane sound wave in an ideal fluid  @xcite , and plane elastic waves in solids  @xcite .",
    "a generalized form of the optical theorem was proposed in the electron diffraction theory using reciprocity relations  @xcite and in the acoustic scattering by objects with inversion symmetry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the generalized theorem was obtained for waves in a stratified medium  @xcite , surface waves  @xcite , and raman scattering by fractal clusters  @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that the ordinary optical theorem established for plane waves has some limitations .",
    "it can not be applied to beams with some transverse amplitude roll - off such as gaussian beams  @xcite .",
    "an extension of the optical theorem for nonplane wave scattering by a radially symmetric potential in quantum mechanics was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , both incident and scattered eigenstates are expanded in spherical function bases , allowing the extinction cross - section be expressed in terms of the expansion coefficients .",
    "another extended optical theorem was derived for the on - axis scattering of a non - diffracting acoustic beam ( such as bessel beams ) propagating in an ideal fluid  @xcite .",
    "this result was subsequently generalized for a scalar beam with arbitrary wavefront  @xcite .",
    "this problem has outstanding similarity with the inelastic scattering of quantum beams by a radial symmetric potential  @xcite .",
    "extended optical theorems using the cylindrical wave decomposition has also been established for both acoustic  @xcite and electromagnetic  @xcite waves .",
    "as noted by newton  @xcite , the optical theorem accounted for dispersion of light propagating in a material . a description of x - rays dispersion was also provided based on similar ideas  @xcite .",
    "it also served as the foundation of the connection between dispersion relation and causality  @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of applications of the optical theorem includes phase shift estimation from measurements of the differential scattering cross - section in quantum mechanics  @xcite , evaluation of cracks in elastic solids  @xcite , diffraction tomography  @xcite , analysis of attenuation effects from scatterers  @xcite , green s function reconstruction in inhomogeneous elastic solid medium  @xcite , seismic interferometry  @xcite , and calculation of energy loss in solids with dislocation  @xcite , to name a few . in ultrasonic nondestructive testing ( ndt )  @xcite , an ultrasound wave is employed to investigate solid structures with inclusions , dislocation , and microcracks  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the wide range of applications that the optical theorem may bring to elastodynamics and ndt , we developed the extended formalism applicable to any longitudinal or shear ultrasound beam of an arbitrary wavefront .",
