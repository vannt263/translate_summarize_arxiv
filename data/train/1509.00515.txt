    "the spinor three - body problem has received renewed interest recently due to the flourish of activity in the cold - atom community focused on the creation and manipulation of bose - condensed gasses of alkali atoms with access to the full multiplet of hyperfine ground states ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and citations within . )",
    "these spinor condensates exhibit the rich interplay between superfluidity and magnetism , displaying interesting static and nonequilibrium many - body phenomenon from spin textures and spin domains to complex spin mixing dynamics @xcite .",
    "this scenario also displays richness on the few - body level , where recent work has focused on the strongly - correlated regime @xcite . in spinor condensate experiments with alkali atoms to date ,",
    "the interactions have typically been weak ( with the exception of @xmath0rb @xcite and possibly also @xmath1cs and @xmath2li ) , and so the strongly - correlated regime remains largely unexplored . in the strongly correlated regime ,",
    "the @xmath3-wave scattering lengths associated with each two - body spin state exceeds the typical range of interatomic interactions , and efimov physics becomes important @xcite . in the single - level case , this leads to the formation of efimov states whose level spectrum has an exponential structure and whose presence strongly affects the scattering observables , characterized by the geometric scaling factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 for identical bosons ) is a universal constant that relates to the strength of the three - body interaction .",
    "one of the major differences of the spinor three - body problem is the presence of multiple length scales in the problem associated with the @xmath3-wave scattering lengths for each of the two - body scattering channels .",
    "this not only modifies the energy spectrum but also increases the number of pathways three - body collisional processes like three - body recombination , atom - dimer relaxation and three - body spin - exchange , can occur @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , the spin physics leads to the appearance of different values for the efimov @xmath5 parameter , leading to the formation of novel families of efimov states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple toy model which illuminates how these novel efimov states arise in spinor systems .",
    "we consider a model where each boson has access to two degenerate internal states . by considering the full parameter space of scattering lengths and couplings between the two - body scattering channels , the mechanism by which the novel efimov states arise is characterized .",
    "our results echo the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , although the toy model presented here is the first to probe the parameter space of scattering lengths and couplings in the case of degenerate internal levels .",
    "on the one - body level the two internal states are labeled @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "pairs of atoms interact via a multichannel generalization of the fermi pseudopotential @xcite , which ( in a.u . )",
    "has the form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the three - dimensional dirac delta - function , @xmath11 is the atomic mass , and @xmath12 is the scattering length matrix . the matrix @xmath12 is a multichannel generalization of the scattering length where the diagonal elements represent the background scattering lengths in each channel and the off - diagonal elements are the couplings .",
    "the two - body basis is constructed by requiring them to be eigenkets of the symmetrization operator @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we solve the three - body problem in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation , using the green s function method developed in refs  @xcite .",
    "the three - body system is characterized by the hyperradius @xmath14 which sets the overall size of the system and a set of five hyperangles collectively denoted @xmath15 which describe the internal motion . treating @xmath14 as an adiabatic parameter",
    ", the three - body wave - function can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the hyperradial wave functions , @xmath18 the channel functions , and @xmath19 the basis set labeling the internal levels for each three - body configuration @xcite .",
    "the task of solving the full three - body schrdinger equation is reduced to solving a the fixed-@xmath14 hyperangular equation @xmath20\\phi_\\nu^\\sigma(r;\\omega)\\\\ = u_\\nu(r)\\phi_\\nu^\\sigma(r;\\omega),\\label{eq : schroad}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the three - body reduced mass , @xmath22 is the grand angular momentum operator @xcite , and @xmath23 is the sum of pairwise interactions . the three - body potential @xmath24 is obtained by solving eq .",
    "[ eq : schroad ] for fixed @xmath14 values , where the problem reduces to solving a transcendental equation whose roots @xmath25 enter as @xmath26 in the single - level case for three identical bosons in the limit @xmath27 , solving eq .",
    "[ eq : schroad ] yields a single imaginary root @xmath28 , which when inserted in eq .",
    "[ eq : threebodypotential ] gives an attractive @xmath29 potential which supports an infinite amount of bound trimers ( efimov states ) characteristic of the efimov effect .",
    "for two identical and one dissimilar bosons @xmath30 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first few @xmath25 for spin-1,2 , and 3 are tabulated over all relevant length scales .",
    "the results demonstrate novel imaginary roots that lie in between the results from the analysis of single - level three - body systems as described in ref .  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we illustrate with a simple toy model how to understand the appearance of these novel roots .",
    "we will discuss first a toy model which explores the parameter space of the matrix @xmath12 , the toy model will then be generalized and a connection with the spinor three - body problem and the appearance of novel efimov roots made . in our two - level toy model @xmath12",
    "is a real - valued symmetric @xmath31 matrix with eigenvalues @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the full parameter space of @xmath12 is large , but by considering a simple case the structure becomes more apparent .",
    "consider the scenario where @xmath34 with eigenvalues @xmath35^{1/2}\\nonumber\\\\ a_\\gamma&=a_{3,3}\\label{eq : egvalues}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and eigenvectors @xmath36^{1/2}\\right]}.\\ ] ] by construction , variation of the angle @xmath37 $ ] ensures that the scattering lengths @xmath32 and @xmath33 remain constant while the eigenvectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe admixtures of the basis states @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in figure 1 , the results from solving eq .",
    "[ eq : schroad ] for the first few roots @xmath25 in the hyperradial region @xmath42 are shown . when @xmath43 , there are two imaginary roots @xmath44 , associated with the three - body configurations @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and all other configurations obtained by label permutation . when @xmath47 , there is only one imaginary root @xmath28 associated with the three - body configuration @xmath48 . for intermediate values of @xmath49 the values @xmath50 are not assigned to any of single - level results .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5 and @xmath51 are associated with a three - body configuration which is a linear combination of the configurations of the extreme @xmath43 and @xmath52 cases and producing novel families of efimov states .     obtained from solving eq .",

    "the roots are plotted versus the angle @xmath49 which controls the amount of admixture in the system.,width=302 ]    the toy model is a result of a unitary transformation , @xmath53 .",
    "equivalently , it is a result of a transformation ( rotation ) of the basis @xmath54 .",
    "what is then the class of unitary transformations which produce novel families of efimov states ?",
    "the eigenvector of @xmath12 attached to the resonant channel must mix two - body product states under the transformation , which can not arise from a unitary transformation on the one - body level .",
    "there is a simple connection between these results and those from ref .",
    "@xcite for spin-1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "when the internal levels are composed of the hyperfine spin multiplet there is the additional requirement that the two - body eigenstates be simultaneous eigenstates of both the symmetrization operator and spin operator @xmath55 .",
    "the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the matrix @xmath55 carries the product basis @xmath56 into the @xmath57 basis , and the elements of this matrix are clebsch - gordan coefficients , which is also equivalent to a unitary transformation of the matrix @xmath12 . in the toy model , the admixture was set by the angle @xmath49 and treated as tunable for exploring the full parameter space . in the spinor case ,",
    "this admixture is set by the values of the clebsch - gordan coefficients . as in the toy model",
    ", this admixture produces roots @xmath50 which are associated with three - body spin configurations that can be composed of a linear combination of product state spin functions and are capable of producing novel families of efimov states .",
