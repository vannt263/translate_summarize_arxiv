    "this precise detail is important with respect to the existence of nonpolynomial solutions giving rise to relevant directions for the gaussian fixed point .",

    "this means that instead of having a line of equivalent fixed points generated by the change of normalization of the field , one gets a line of non equivalent fixed points each being associated with a different value of the field - rescaling parameter @xmath9 .",
    "however a residual effect of the invariance allows to determine an optimal value of @xmath9 .",

    "the nonperturbative wilson s approach for example in the papers by wetterich and coworkers .",
    "the expression `` continuum limit '' comes from the consideration of a field theory on a lattice for which one would like to make the lattice spacing @xmath79 vanish ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "in fact , the wilson theory allows us to consider special kinds of actions which already display the fantastic property of evolving ( under the effect of a rg transformation ) as if the lattice spacing was actually zero although it is not .",
    "these actions are called `` improved actions ''  @xcite or `` perfect actions ''  @xcite according to the method used to construct them .    actually , the continuum limit of a lattice field theory leads to a nonperturbative equivalent expression of the notion of renormalizability .",
    "this relies essentially upon the following correspondence :    * in one hand ( perturbation theory ) , the renormalizability states that one may push the initial cutoff @xmath0 ( @xmath81 ) to infinity while defining only a finite ( usually small ) number of renormalized parameters ; * in the other hand ( wilson s theory ) , in the same limit ( @xmath82 ) , the nature of the renormalized parameters and their number are given by the finite set ( usually small ) of relevant directions of a fixed point .",
    "but , be careful , the expression : `` _ the relevant parameters are the renormalized parameters _ '' is incomplete ( and thus incorrect ) .",
    "this is because there are two _ inseparable _ aspects in the definition of a renormalized parameter :    1 .",
    "its nature : e.g. , is it a @xmath83-like or a @xmath84-like coupling or something else ?",
    "2 .   the rg flow which runs along a renormalized trajectory ( rt ) emerging from the fixed point .",
    "this flow is usually expressed via a @xmath85-function expressing a momentum dependence of the renormalized coupling ( the nature of which is already specified ) .    a relevant",
    "parameter has the same nature as the renormalized parameter but , because the notion of relevance is attached to a linearization of the rg transformation in the vicinity of a fixed point ,  @xcite the flow carried by a relevant parameter runs locally only _ tangentially _ to the trajectory of actual interest .",
    "consequently , the second characteristics ( the rg flow along the rt ) is not correctly expressed by the relevant character of a parameter .",
    "it is the aim of the following considerations to illustrate and discuss these issues .    : since the famous review by wilson and kogut ,  @xcite one invariably illustrates the notion of continuum limit with the once unstable fixed point configuration giving rise to a _ purely massive _",
    "renormalized field theory .",
    "but it is not the best candidate for an illustration of the most important aspect of the rg in field theory , namely , the momentum - scale dependence of the renormalized parameters ( i.e. , in the continuum limit ) .",
    "@xcite let us first discuss briefly this traditional figure ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .    in the wilson space @xmath86 ( of infinite dimension @xmath87 ) of the action - parameters",
    ", there is the critical submanifold @xmath88 of dimension @xmath89 in which , when @xmath90 , lies the wilson - fisher fixed point ( with only one direction of infrared instability ) .",
    "if we initialize a bare action in @xmath88 , then the rg transformation carries the running action toward the fixed point .",
    "if the bare action is chosen very close to @xmath88 , then the renormalization trajectory passes close to the fixed point and finally goes away from @xmath88 essentially along a limiting trajectory which ideally emerges from @xmath88 at the fixed point .",
    "this trajectory is a rt because if we formally associate a point of it to a finite and fixed momentum scale @xmath18 then , since an infinite time is required to go out from the fixed point , the initial cutoff @xmath0 ( assumed to be associated to the fixed point ) appears to be infinite with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "then it is an obvious matter to show that the relevant parameter ( presently a mass ) takes on a finite value at this point and that , consequently , a finite ( renormalized ) mass - parameter exists in the limit @xmath92 .",
    "this issue , which specifies the nature of the renormalized parameters in the continuum limit , clearly illustrates the crucial aspect of the renormalizability : namely the small number of the renormalized parameters finally involved .    the second issue ( the specification of the rg flow ) is the main content of the rgt .",
    "the rg flow in the continuum is precisely ( obviously ) the flow which runs along the rt . ideally , to get it in the exact rgt , we could initialize the action at a point lying _",
    "right on _ the rt ( perfect action ) .",
    "although the corresponding cutoff is @xmath0 , the perfect action is `` renormalized '' ( the continuum limit is reached ) in the sense that the subsequent evolution under a rg transformation is unique ( for a given fixed point ) .    hence , the continuum limit could be obtained by imposing a perfect action as initial condition to the erge .",
    "but , since the rt is entirely plunged in a space of infinite dimension , an infinite number of action - parameters must be specified . because this can not be realized in practice",
    ", one has recourse either to a truncation ( approximate perfect action ) or to a limiting process consisting in a fine tuning of the bare action somewhere close to @xmath88 .    in perturbation",
    "theory an initial complicated action is never considered explicitly . on the contrary ,",
    "one systematically insists on the fact that the renormalized action remains simple ( i.e. , does not involve an infinite number of parameters ) .",
    "hence , the latter mentioned facet of the wilson theory seems to contradict the notion of renormalizability which we were particularly attached to .",
    "actually , in the expression of the rg flow in the `` continuum '' , we distinguish two things :    a ) : :    the rg flow itself characterized by its instantaneous speed .",
    "it may be    expressed with a small number of flowing parameters the nature of which is that of the    relevant parameters at the fixed point .",
    "the scale dependence then    expresses under a differential form ( @xmath85-functions ) .",
    "it is that aspect of the renormalization of field theory which is    privilegiated in the perturbative approach .",
    "b ) : :    the initialization of the rg flow .",
    "it requires the specification of an    infinite number of conditions on the action .",
    "this aspect of the    renormalization of field theory is nonperturbative by nature .",
    "we refer    to it as the functional form of the scale dependence in the continuum    limit .",
    "a legitimate question then arises . since in constructing perturbatively the renormalized theory",
    "we never refer explicitly to a fixed point  and a fortiori to the notion of relevance  , and also we never consider any perfect action , how the right rg flow has been chosen allowing us to get `` the best '' estimates of the 3-@xmath93 critical exponents even though these quantities are highly nonperturbative in nature ?",
    "the answer is : by picking out a particular rg flow which turns out to be the slowest in @xmath86 .",
    "let us illustrate this with the massless @xmath94-theory .",
    ": a massless theory is defined in the critical submanifold @xmath88 .",
    "because the renormalization of field theory gives rise to a scale dependence , the massless theory of interest is not defined at the fixed point .",
    "of course , a fixed point theory is scale invariant and could correspond to a theory without mass ( since a mass would break the scale invariance ) .",
    "but , despite this marvellous and fascinating property of scale invariance , at a fixed point everything is fixed , there is no scale dependence and in fact , there is nothing interesting to describe .",
    "the 3-@xmath93 massless theory which we are interested in is scale dependent and it is defined by reference to a rg flow running in @xmath88 and emerging from the gaussian fixed point .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the same fixed point configuration as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] but with a larger view which includes the gaussian fixed point .",
    "we can see a rt which emerges from the gaussian fp .",
    "it is the rt on which is defined the continuum limit of the massless field theory for @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows exclusively the ( projected ) rg flows in the critical submanifold @xmath88 .",
    "we observe critical flows reaching the wilson - fisher fixed point . to get these critical trajectories we must adjust , for each of them , one parameter of the initial action ( critical temperature ) .",
    "the rt for the massless field theory interpolates between the gaussian and the wilson - fisher fixed points .",
    "it is an ( infrared ) attractive one - dimensional submanifold .",
    "it is like a large river into which the ordinary wilson flows run .",
    "it corresponds to the slowest flow in the wilson space .",
    "@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is static : it only shows rg trajectories .",
    "[ fig5 ] is a dynamic picture of the flows showing the evolution of the @xmath83-coupling @xmath95 along the critical ( massless ) rt .",
    "we obtain this way an image of the functional forms of the scale dependence in the continuum which differ only by one initial condition .",
    "if we require that each flow reaches the same value of @xmath96 ( the same point in @xmath86 ) at the same time , then we obtain an unique evolution except for some marginal `` finite cutoff '' effects corresponding to those trajectories which were initialized far from the gaussian fixed point .",
    "expressed under the differential form , we get a unique @xmath85-function : @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath85-function so obtained expresses the uniqueness of the slowest flow along the rt which interpolates between the gaussian and wilson - fisher fixed point ( in the critical submanifilod @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is precisely that flow which has been picked out by the perturbative approach while applying the subtraction procedure required to make finite , order by order , the perturbative series of the @xmath98-theory in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "so defined as carrier of the differential rg flow running along the rt , @xmath95 is like the usual renormalized @xmath83-coupling of perturbation theory provided that asymptotically close to the gaussian fixed point it behaves like the @xmath83-coupling which coincides with the relevant direction at this fixed point as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . ] .    once the ideal flow has been selected near the gaussian fixed point , it remains to calculate the perturbative series and to borel - resum them up to the wilson - fisher fixed point in order to estimate the critical exponents .",
    "@xcite    now this is not the whole story , because , when @xmath59 , there are ultraviolet renormalon singularities in the perturbative series which prevent them from being borel summable .",
    "@xcite    in four dimensions , the wilson - fisher fixed point disappears and all the critical rg flows run toward the gaussian fixed point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we see that , if the ideal slowest flow is underlying ( all the trajectories are attracted to an infrared stable submanifold of dimension one ) , it can not be exactly reached by the rg flows because there is no once - unstable fixed point in @xmath88 which could canalize all the degrees of freedom of the theory along an unique ideal ( perfect ) trajectory yielding a complete momentum scale dependence in the range @xmath99 0,\\infty \\right [ $ ] .",
    "consequently , the wilson trajectories _ approach _ the ideal trajectory in the infrared regime but never reach it exactly and there remain ambiguities between the actual and the ideal trajectories especially in the ultraviolet regime ( i.e. , at least for the momentum - scale of reference larger to some finite @xmath100 ) .",
    "the only possibility of reaching a pseudo `` continuum limit '' ( i.e. , of reaching the ideal , but incomplete , slowest rg flow ) would be to explicitly write down the perfect action which associates a point of the underlying ideal trajectory to @xmath18 ( initial condition on the functional form of the momentum scale dependence )",
    ". however an infinity of conditions are required and moreover the range of variation of the momentum - scale would remain finite ( @xmath99 0,\\lambda _ { \\max } \\right ] $ ] ) due to the lack of ultraviolet stable fixed point .",
    "ambiguities are then induced in the process of defining of the initial ( perfect ) action in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "ambiguities of the same nature as the preceding ones exist also in perturbation theory , they are due to ultraviolet renormalons .  @xcite it has been shown by parisi  @xcite and then by bergre and david  @xcite that the renormalons could be removed from the theory by considering an infinite number of composite operators and this would amount to reintroducing a `` finite cutoff '' .",
    "@xcite in fact , this removal is nothing but the construction of the perfect action ( initialization of the functional form of the momentum - scale dependence ) . indeed it has been shown that even in the absence of an ultraviolet stable fixed point , the perturbative series of the @xmath98 field theory are borel summable  @xcite provided that the rg flow be initialized somewhere and identifiable at any smaller cutoff scale ( infra - red @xmath98 model - model is a massless theory with an ultra - violet cutoff .",
    "its renormalization flows have been also rigorously studied .",
    "@xcite ] ) .    in the continuum limit ,",
    "the problem of dealing with the infinite number of degrees of freedom is completely involved in the initial condition of the ideal scale dependence provided we have first picked out the slowest flow .",
    "if the ultraviolet stable fixed point is lacking then the initial condition is obliged and introduces ambiguities .",
    "otherwise , all the degrees of freedom are exactly canalized in the relevant direction leaving no room for any ambiguity ( the obliged initial condition takes place `` at '' the fixed point ) .",
    "now the following question arises : why the @xmath85-function perturbatively determined would display renormalon singularities since it expresses a simple flow describable by a single variable while the renormalons are related to the specification of an obliged initial condition ( involving explicitly the infinity of degrees of freedom of the theory ) ?",
    "the answer is that in the definition of the @xmath85-function , there are two aspects :    1 .   the slowest flow itself 2 .   the running variable chosen to express this flow    if we choose the renormalized coupling via a renormalization - point condition then the question of dealing explicitly with the infinity of degrees of freedom ( determination of a vertex function ) is raised and there is a gap between the ideal flow and the variable chosen",
    ". consequently , there are renormalon singularities in the @xmath85-function in four dimensions .",
    "however if we choose a renormalization scheme in such a way as to exclusively refer to the ideal slowest flow without making any reference to any vertex function , then the @xmath85-function in four dimensions would have no renormalon singularities at all and it would be borel summable .",
    "such renormalization schemes exist , they are called minimal subtraction schemes . in such schemes , one only subtracts what is necessary to make the theory finite when @xmath59 , the renormalized coupling is not a vertex function , it is some intermediate parameter not particularly defined in other respects and the momentum scale of reference is purely artificial . in doing",
    "so one has exclusively referred to the ideal slowest flow .",
