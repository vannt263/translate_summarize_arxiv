    "before 2005 , we believed we knew very well how to model the evolution and interior structure of the sun",
    ". evolved solar models with the latest input physics ( including diffusive helium and element settling and without tachocline mixing ) reproduced the sound speed profile determined from seismic inversions to within 0.4@xmath0 , as well as the seismically - inferred convection zone depth and convection zone helium abundance .",
    "solar interior modelers had little impetus to progress beyond one - dimensional spherical models of the sun , with perhaps the exception of introducing some additional mixing below the convection zone ( hereafter cz ) to deplete surface lithium and reduce the small remaining sound - speed discrepancy at the cz base .",
    "for the ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter gn93 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gs98 ) abundances , the simplest ` spherical sun ' assumptions appeared nearly adequate for solar modeling .",
    "these include one - dimensional zoning ( concentric shells in hydrostatic equilibrium ) , initial homogeneous composition , negligible mass loss or accretion , neglecting rotation and magnetic fields , simple surface boundary conditions , mixing - length theory of convection ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and no additional mixing or structural changes from convective overshoot , shear from differential rotation , meridional circulation , waves , or oscillations .    however , new analyses of solar spectral lines revise downward the abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium , particularly the abundances of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen that contribute to the opacity just below the cz",
    ". see table [ table : abund ] for a summary of some of the major abundance revisions over the last twenty years .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ table : zyr ] summarizes the cz y , cz base radius , and photosphere z / x for the models examined here . figure [ fig : c_all ] shows the relative sound - speed differences of our models with the gn93 mixture , the ags05 mixture , and models with mass - loss , accretion , and convective overshoot .",
    "the observed minus calculated frequencies of these models are shown in figure [ fig : o - c_all ] .",
    "as seen in table [ table : zyr ] and figures [ fig : c_all ] and [ fig : o - c_all ] , the ags05 model and overshoot model do not agree well with the data . the gn93 model , the 1.3 m@xmath1 mass loss model , and the accretion model show better agreement , though no model matches the data perfectly .",
    "figure [ fig : small_sep_all ] shows the small frequency separation differences of the guzik et al .",
    "models minus the solar - cycle corrected frequency differences from the bison group @xcite for @xmath2=0 and 2 modes , which are sensitive to the structure of the core .",
    "this plot illustrates that including low - z accretion in the model retains the core structure of the gn93 model .",
    "the overshoot model and ags05 model do not agree as well with the data as the models with higher core z. the mass losing model with the best sound speed and observed minus calculated frequency agreement ( m@xmath3 = 1.3 m@xmath4 ) shows worse agreement than any of the other models .",
    "however , mass loss does change the value of the small frequency separation in the right direction to correct for the discrepancy seen with the new abundances .",
    "perhaps the over - compensation indicates that this model has too much mass loss ; a model with a smaller initial mass would reduce the disagreement , as seen with the m@xmath3 = 1.15 m@xmath4 model .",
    "mass - losing models can improve seismic agreement for the new abundances , but they do not fully restore agreement .",
    "in addition , the destruction of too much li and the production of too much surface @xmath5 make the two models considered here unlikely . a smaller amount of mass loss that leads to destruction of some , but",
    "not all , of the initial li could provide a plausible partial mitigation of the solar abundance problem .",
    "the accretion model allows for a solar interior that is similar to models developed with the higher abundances and therefore agrees nicely with seismic inferences in the central 0.5 r@xmath4 of the sun .",
    "the model still shows poor agreement near the cz base .",
    "the very steep z abundance gradient developed at the cz base seen in figure [ fig : z_accret ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might have a detectable signature in the seismic frequencies .",
    "@xcite finds that inversions appear to rule out such steep composition gradients at the cz base .    the convective overshoot model with a cz depth of 0.704 r@xmath4 improves sound speed agreement slightly within the cz but not much below it . extending the cz depth to 0.64 r@xmath4 results in even worse agreement .",
    "in addition , y diffusion is not inhibited by the deeper cz , as we had hoped .",
    "at the suggestion of both the referee and a colleague p. bonifacio , we also include here a preliminary exploration of solar models using the co@xmath6bold abundances with a z / x of 0.0209 and z of 0.0154 , intermediate between the ags05 and agss09 abundances , but lower than the gn93 abundances .",
    "because the abundances of only 12 elements have been re - evaluated at this time by the co@xmath6bold group @xcite , it is a little premature to create new opacity tables for the co@xmath6bold mixture , which can , in principle be done using the lawrence livermore opal web request at http://opalopacity.llnl.gov . in addition",
    ", we do not have low - temperature opacities for a mixture representative of the co@xmath6bold abundances available to us .",
    "therefore , here we decided to calibrate standard models to the z / x of co@xmath6bold using opacity tables based on the gn93 and ags05 mixtures .",
    "we observe that the o / fe ( oxygen to iron ) mass fraction ratio of co@xmath6bold is 4.98 , intermediate between the o / fe mass ratio of 6.56 for the gn93 mixture and 4.65 for the ags05 mixture , so our two standard models should bracket results that use the co@xmath6bold mixture in the opacity tables .",
    "we did update abundances to the co@xmath6bold values for our in - line equation of state calculation and for tracking the diffusion of the major elements .",
    "the initial y , z , and mixing length to pressure - scale - height ratios needed to calibrate to the co@xmath6bold z / x using either opacity set are listed in table [ table : zyr ] ; figures [ fig : c_caf ] , [ fig : smallsep_caf ] , and [ fig : o - c_caf ] show the results for sound - speed differences , small separations between calculated @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=2 modes , and observed minus calculated frequencies for @xmath2 = 0 , 2 , 10 , and 20 .",
    "the sound speed discrepancy is reduced to only about 0.6@xmath0 at the convection zone base for the co@xmath6bold abundances , compared to 1.4@xmath0 for the ags05 abundances and 0.4@xmath0 for the gn93 abundances .",
    "the results for either opacity set are identical above 0.6 r@xmath1 , but differ below this where oxygen is the main opacity contributor , and in the core where iron is the main opacity contributor , as expected .",
    "the model using the ags05 opacity mixture requires a higher y abundance to compensate for the relatively higher fe opacity contribution in the core",
    ". the small separations and observed minus calculated frequencies are slightly higher than found for a model calibrated to the gn93 abundances on average , but not as high as for a model calibrated to the ags05 z / x .    as also surmised by the referee , since the co@xmath6bold sound speed differences are closer to observed , improvement could be obtained with a smaller amount of mass loss .",
    "here we have calculated an additional mass - loss model with initial mass 1.1 m@xmath1 and an initial mass - loss rate of 2.25 x 10@xmath7 m@xmath1/yr , exponentially decaying with e - folding time 0.45 gyr .",
    "this model was calibrated to the co@xmath6bold z / x using the ags05 opacities that have o / fe abundance closer to that of the co@xmath6bold o / fe .",
    "previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indiciated that an initial mass of 1.1 m@xmath1 or less and a relatively short mass loss phase ( less than 0.2 - 0.5 gyr ) could deplete the lithium to the present - day observed values from initial solar - system abundance without completely destroying the lithium or building up too much @xmath8he .",
    "the sound speed agreement ( figure [ fig : c_caf ] ) shows considerable improvement with this smaller amount of mass loss ; however , the agreement for the solar core is not as good as for the non - mass losing models , as can be seen more clearly in the small separations ( figure [ fig : smallsep_caf ] )",
    ". this mass - losing model restores the level of agreement attained with the gn93 abundances for the observed minus calculated frequencies ( figure [ fig : o - c_caf ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lum_cafml ] shows the luminosity versus time for this model , as well as for the standard solar models evolved with gn93 and ags05 abundances .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_cafml ] shows the effective temperature experienced by the surface layer throughout the evolution of the mass - loss model compared to that experienced by the standard models . during the mass - losing phase , the high temperatures that depleted the lithium in the current surface layer were experienced when the material that is at the surface of the now 1 m@xmath1 sun was deeper , before the previous surface layers were lost .",
    "after the mass - loss phase , the temperature that affects the surface layer is that of the cz base , since the material currently at the surface is continually mixed through the cz .",
    "we see that including mass loss in the co@xmath6bold model exposes the surface layers to high enough temperatures to deplete li early in the evolution ( 2.8 million k is the temperature required for relatively rapid li destruction ) .",
    "it is not clear that the advantages of mass loss ( e.g. li depletion and better sound speed agreement in the outer 80@xmath0 of the solar radius ) can be retained while at the same time not creating a discrepancy in the inner 20@xmath0 .",
    "in spite of the seismic evidence in favor of the old abundances , the new abundances can not be easily dismissed .",
    "the improvements in the physics of the atmospheric models used to determine the abundances , the success achieved in line - profile matching , and the self - consistency of the abundance determinations provide great credibility to the new lower abundances .",
    "however , solar models developed with the new abundances remain discrepant with helioseismic constraints , even with a variety of ( often unjustified ) changes to the input physics .",
    "adjustments to the evolution of solar models , such as the early mass loss and low - z accretion discussed here , show some promise but do not fully restore agreement .",
    "any single adjustment to solar models does not fully resolve the problem .",
    "combinations of changes might provide better agreement but seem contrived .",
    "a resolution to the solar abundance problem ( or the solar model problem ) remains elusive .    in the future",
    ", a more comprehensive exploration of parameter space , including opacity variations , different mass - loss or accretion prescriptions , diffusion , and perhaps even combinations of these effects could be useful .",
    "in particular , models with ags05 abundances and a smaller amount of mass loss than explored here may provide a way to retain the core structure without completely destroying li or creating too much @xmath8he build - up .",
    "further examination of the co@xmath6bold models with revised abundances for every element and opacity tables ( including low - t opacities ) adjusted for a new mixture would also be enlightening .",
