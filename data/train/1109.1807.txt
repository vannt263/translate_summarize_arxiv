    "in the classical theory , discrete - time measurable and topological dynamical systems are generated by the iteration of a single automorphism on a space , and are thus actions of the group @xmath3 . since the 1970 s an important direction of research has focused on actions of more general groups .",
    "the work of ornstein and weiss @xcite has established countable amenable groups as a general setting for ergodic theory . the discrete heisenberg group is the first natural example of a non - abelian group in this category and its actions are of interest in a variety of contexts within and without dynamical systems .",
    "while the work in @xcite establishes many tools of ergodic theory for the discrete heisenberg group , actions of this group are not nearly as well understood as actions of @xmath2 .",
    "this is due , partly , to the non - commutative nature of the group but also to the more complicated geometry of orbits of the action .",
    "recent work has focused on algebraic actions of this group ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .    in this paper , we provide some geometric intuition for general measurable actions of this group by studying the concrete case of heisenberg odometers . our main result gives a detailed geometric analysis of these actions .",
    "we also provide an explicit description of the finite dimensional , irreducible representations of the heisenberg group which can arise in the spectral decomposition of a heisenberg odometer .",
    "our work establishes explicitly , generalizing the classical theory , the connection between the algebraic structure of the odometer and the spectrum of the action .",
    "odometer systems are a well studied class of examples in the classical theory of measurable and topological dynamical systems generated by a single transformation .",
    "they are rank one transformations , and therefore are ergodic and have zero entropy .",
    "they have discrete rational spectrum and are the key ingredients in the study of toeplitz systems .",
    "they can be viewed measure theoretically as cutting and stacking transformations of the unit interval .",
    "alternatively , they can be viewed algebraically as an action of @xmath3 on an inverse limit space of increasing quotient groups of @xmath3 .",
    "they can also be viewed as an action by addition in an adic group .",
    "it follows that they are , in fact uniquely ergodic ( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein , and @xcite ) .",
    "all of these perspectives can be generalized to define odometer actions of @xmath2 and there is an obvious way to construct examples . in the case of @xmath4 ,",
    "given any two @xmath3 odometer actions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the maps @xmath7 acting on @xmath8 clearly commute and satisfy the appropriate generalizations of the above ideas to @xmath9 . in @xcite cortez",

    "let @xmath10 be the discrete heisenberg group , defined on the set @xmath1 with the following group multiplication : @xmath11    in this paper we show that there are geometric considerations similar to the @xmath9 case which separate different types of heisenberg odometers .",
    "informally , thinking of subgroups of the heisenberg group as subsets of @xmath1 with a different group multiplication , we can associate to any heisenberg odometer , a @xmath9 odometer constructed by considering the projections of the heisenberg subgroups onto their first two coordinates .",
    "if the associated @xmath9 odometer is of product type , as defined by cortez , we call the heisenberg odometer an _ @xmath12-product",
    "_ odometer . if the subgroups used to construct the odometer , considered as sets in @xmath1 , have the structure @xmath13 for some nonsingular matrix @xmath14 and @xmath15 we call it a _ flat _ odometer .",

    ", it is obvious how to construct pure product type odometers for the heisenberg group .",
    "we show by construction that all the other types of odometers also exist .",

    ". figure  [ fig : pic ] provides a guide to the examples constructed in the paper . in order to construct heisenberg odometers that are not of product type in section  [ sec : heisclassify ] we extend the work in @xcite by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a @xmath2 odometer to be of product type .",

    "the following facts are easily verified by computation and we will use them frequently in our arguments : @xmath30    recall also that there exist group homomorphisms @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , so that the following is a short exact sequence : @xmath35    [ prop : struc ] let @xmath36 be a finite index subgroup of @xmath10 and let @xmath37 be as in .",

    "so for all @xmath125 , by relabelling , we have the decomposition @xmath266 such that @xmath267 is an irreducible , finite dimensional representation of @xmath0 .",
    "recalling the fact that @xmath242 is equivalent to the regular representation of @xmath231 , the collection @xmath268 for @xmath269 must include all representations of that finite group .    to complete the argument note that the space @xmath270 contains all characteristic functions @xmath271}$ ] .",
    "furthermore , the collection of characteristic functions generates an algebra of continuous functions that separates points in @xmath20 , is closed under complex conjugation and contains the constants .",
    "therefore , by the stone - weierstrass theorem @xmath272 contains the continuous functions on @xmath20 , and by the density of the continuous functions in the @xmath273 norm , must therefore be all of @xmath274 .",
    "if in addition we suppose that @xmath0 is a discrete , countable , and amenable group , recent developments in the field yield the following immediate corollary .",
    "[ entro ] if @xmath0 is a discrete , countable , and amenable group then every @xmath0 odometer action has zero entropy .",
    "suppose not .",
    "it would then follow from @xcite that @xmath25 has a bernoulli factor . by @xcite",
    "this factor would have countable lebesgue spectrum , contradicting theorem  [ discrete ] .",
    "in @xcite the authors prove that every sub - odometer is the measure theoretic factor of an odometer .",
    "the following result then follows immediately from theorem  [ discrete ] and corollary  [ entro ] .",
    "every @xmath0 sub - odometer has discrete spectrum .",
    "if , in addition @xmath0 is a discrete , countable , and amenable group , then every @xmath0 sub - odometer has zero entropy .      let us fix a @xmath9 odometer on @xmath221 .",
    "let @xmath275 denote a character of @xmath9 . by an abuse of notation we refer to the pair @xmath276 , rather than the associated character , as an eigenvalue of the action .",
    "we further only concern ourselves with @xmath277 . for the remaining of this section we let the quotient notation , i.e. @xmath278 , mean a specific complete collection of coset representatives .",
    "cortez @xcite shows that a pair @xmath276 is an eigenvalue of the odometer action if and only if there exists @xmath125 so that @xmath279 an easy computation shows that ( [ eval1 ] ) holds if and only if there exists a vector @xmath280 such that @xmath281 it is therefore clear that there are @xmath282 distinct eigenvalues of the odometer action which are associated to the @xmath125th stage of the construction of the odometer . denote the set of vectors @xmath276 satisfying by @xmath283 and fix @xmath125 . for ease of notation",
    "we suppress the subscript @xmath125 and let the reader determine from the context whether the eigenvalues are being represented as row or column vectors .",
    "let @xmath284 .",
    "if @xmath285 then it follows from ( [ eval ] ) that there will be @xmath286 eigenvalues of the form @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 . to determine @xmath290 in the case of non - diagonal matrices we use ( [ eval1 ] ) to write @xmath291 for some @xmath292 . if the rows of @xmath40 have relatively prime entries , i.e. @xmath293 , then the numerator of the first component can be made to take any value @xmath294 , taken modulo @xmath295 .",
    "therefore there are exactly @xmath295 choices for @xmath296 , each with a corresponding @xmath297 .",
    "but there are @xmath295 pairs possible , so this exhausts all possible pairs that can occur , meaning all possible @xmath297 have now appeared . so given an @xmath296 there can only be a unique @xmath297 such that @xmath276 is an eigenvalue .",
    "notice in the above two cases , for any @xmath296 that appears in the spectrum of the odometer , the number of @xmath297 that can pair with it is the same for any @xmath296 .",
    "it will follow from our work below that this holds in general .",
    "in particular , given any matrix @xmath40 we can decompose it into the product of a diagonal matrix with a matrix whose rows have relatively prime entries : @xmath298 the set @xmath290 can be described in a nice geometric fashion using the matrix @xmath299 .",
    "using we have @xmath300 . on the other hand , @xmath301 and therefore taking addition modulo @xmath9 @xmath302    so given any @xmath9 odometer , there is now a clear algorithm for listing the eigenvalues corresponding to a fixed stage @xmath125 . using first find @xmath292 such that @xmath303 and let @xmath304 .",
    "the following is a complete list ( without repetition ) of all @xmath295 eigenvalues of the @xmath9 action from this stage : @xmath305 note that the since @xmath306 for all @xmath307 , this collection will include all previous stage eigenvalues as well .      the main result of this section characterizes which finite dimensional irreducible representations of the heisenberg group can arise in the spectrum of a given heisenberg odometer .",
    "using standard inducing techniques from representation theory , indukaev has shown in @xcite that for a given dimension @xmath308 , all @xmath308 dimensional , irreducible representations of the discrete heisenberg group @xmath10 can be parametrized by three scalars @xmath309 and have the following structure : @xmath310\\alpha)}\\epsilon_{(j - x)\\!\\!\\!\\!\\mod p}\\ ] ] where @xmath311 , @xmath312 is an irreducible fraction of the form @xmath313 , @xmath277 is arbitrary , @xmath314 denotes the projection onto the @xmath315th coordinate in a finite @xmath308-dimensional space , @xmath316 , and for @xmath317 , @xmath318 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath95 .",
    "conversely , given any such triple @xmath319 , the operator defined by gives a @xmath308 dimensional , irreducible representation of @xmath10 . in what follows , for ease of notation",
    ", we say that @xmath319 lies in the spectrum of an @xmath10 odometer action if the corresponding @xmath308 dimensional , irreducible representation of @xmath10 occurs in its spectral decomposition .",
    "let @xmath23 , defined by @xmath320 , be a sequence of normal subgroups of @xmath10 giving rise to a heisenberg odometer action",
    ". then @xmath321 , with @xmath322 , lies in the spectrum of the odometer action on @xmath223 if and only if there exists @xmath125 such that @xmath308 divides @xmath323 and for all @xmath324 @xmath325    fix a heisenberg odometer action on @xmath223 and let @xmath224 denote the triples associated with the subgroups @xmath108 .",
    "suppose that @xmath319 is in the spectrum of @xmath223 .",
    "several easy observations follow from our proof of theorem  [ discrete ] . first ,",
    "since there is an inductive structure to the spectral decomposition of @xmath326 , there exists @xmath125 such that @xmath327 arises in the spectral decomposition of @xmath328 .",
    "it also follows from the proof that the representations that occur in this decomposition are exactly the regular representations of the subgroup @xmath329 .",
    "thus , for all @xmath330 , the representation given in with this triple reduces to the identity operator on @xmath108 , meaning that we have @xmath331\\alpha\\in\\mathbb z\\qquad\\text{for $ j=0,\\cdots , p-1$}.\\ ] ] since @xmath332 it follows immediately that @xmath308 divides @xmath323 .",
    "recall from proposition  [ prop : normal ] that it is necessary that @xmath323 divides all the entries of @xmath222 so @xmath333=\\frac{x}{p}$ ] and @xmath334 .",
    "thus for @xmath330 reduces to requiring @xmath335 for all @xmath336 . the fact that @xmath308 is a divisor of @xmath323 now yields .",
    "suppose now that @xmath319 is such that there exists @xmath125 for which @xmath308 divides @xmath323 and holds . using it follows immediately that holds and thus the representation given in is an irreducible representation of @xmath329 , therefore it must occur in the regular representation of @xmath329 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it now follows from our proof of theorem  [ discrete ] that @xmath319 occurs in the spectrum of @xmath223 .    if @xmath337 , then the only non - zero irreducible fraction of the form @xmath313 comes from @xmath338 so in we have @xmath339 and since @xmath340 the one dimensional representations that occur have the form @xmath341 .",
    "thus , as we noted before , we see that the one dimensional representations that occur in the decomposition are precisely those that come from pairs @xmath276 that are eigenvalues of the associated @xmath9 odometer .",
    "in the case of a flat odometer , without loss of generality we can assume @xmath342 for all @xmath125 , and we can conclude that the triples that occur are exactly those @xmath327 where @xmath343 is an eigenvalue of the associated @xmath9 odometer .",
    "otherwise the values of @xmath297 and @xmath296 depend on the structure of the functions @xmath169 .",
    "below we compute some examples to show the effect of these functions @xmath169 on the spectrum of the odometer .",
    "consider the sequence of matrices @xmath344 and @xmath174 where the sequence @xmath345 as defined in example  [ ex : kn ] . for any choice of the sequence @xmath169 for which the triple @xmath224 defines a heisenberg odometer , the associated @xmath9 odometer has eigenvalues of the form @xmath346 for @xmath347 . fix a stage @xmath125 , assume @xmath308 divides @xmath345 and that @xmath348 is relatively prime to @xmath308 .",
    "we consider three different choices for the sequence @xmath169 .",
    "a.   let @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath308-dimensional representations that occur will be those corresponding to the triples @xmath349 .",
    "+ b.   let @xmath350 .",
    "this gives rise to the odometer constructed in example  [ ex : kn ] where we showed that it is not flat so we expect a different set of representations to occur .",
    "indeed , the triples @xmath319 that can occur now have to satisfy : @xmath351 therefore the representations that occur will be those corresponding to the triples @xmath352 . + c.   let @xmath353 . an argument parallel to that given in example  [ ex : kn ] shows that this choice of @xmath169 gives rise to an odometer action which is not flat .",
    "the triples that occur must satisfy @xmath354 which gives us triples of the form @xmath355 .",
    "thus , this last example is not flat and also not conjugate to the odometer from example  [ ex : kn ] .",
