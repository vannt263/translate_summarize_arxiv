    "the great era of galactic cartography is upon us .",
    "the last twenty years have seen ambitious photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the galaxy provide magnitudes and radial velocities for many millions of stars .",
    "astrometric surveys of the galaxy began with the now comparatively modest _ hipparcos _ mission ( see @xcite for a summary of its achievements ) and will culminate with the launch of the _ gaia _ satellite in 2013 .",
    "this will provide micro - arcsecond astrometry for @xmath0 stars brighter than @xmath1 @xcite , as well as radial velocities for stars brighter than @xmath2 .",
    "positional and kinematic data on bright stars in the galaxy and its neighbours will be routinely available by the end of its mission .",
    "this wealth of new data motivates the study of new theoretical questions .",
    "a classical problem in dynamical astronomy is to estimate the enclosed mass from the relative positions and velocities of a collection of bound test particles or tracers .",
    "hitherto , work has primarily concentrated on the case in which the velocities are line - of - sight or projected .",
    "here there has been an extensive body of work starting with methods essentially exploiting the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "the problems with such virial estimators were enunciated by @xcite , who introduced the notion of projected mass estimators based on sums of the projected mass contributions , namely [ ( projected distance ) @xmath3 ( radial velocity)@xmath4 / g ] . in this form , the estimator is naturally suited to the case of a point mass ( the kepler potential ) . the extension to",
    "scale - free potentials with @xmath5 was developed by @xcite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wea ) .",
    "the estimator then takes a different form , namely sums of contributions of the form [ ( distance)@xmath6 @xmath3 ( radial velocity)@xmath4 / g ] .",
    "finally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) have shown how to adapt these ideas for an arbitrary spherical potential by choosing a weight function .",
    "the case of proper motions has so far received very little attention .",
    "the coming of age of _ gaia _ will make the availability of proper motions and radial velocities standard for all objects in the nearby universe brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "hence , this paper is devoted to the problem of estimating the enclosed mass from a tracer population when their space velocities are known .",
    "throughout this paper , we operate under the simplest assumption that the gravitational potential is spherical .",
    "a tracer population of stars with a number density @xmath7 resides in the potential .",
    "this is sampled to provide @xmath8 objects with known positions , radial velocities and proper motions .",
    "we shall usually consider the application to the problem of estimating the dark halo mass within the radius of the outermost datapoint @xmath9 .",
    "we start with the spherical jeans equation , which reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xcite anisotropy parameter .",
    "this can be integrated into the form @xmath12 \\frac{rv_r^2}{\\tilde\\mu}\\right\\rangle -3r_\\mathrm{out}\\varsigma^2,\\ ] ] where the angled bracket represents the average over the whole tracer population .",
    "here @xmath13 is the total halo mass within radius @xmath9 , and @xmath14 is the halo mass profile @xmath15 normalized by the total mass such that @xmath16 , whereas @xmath17}{{\\mathrm d}\\log r } = 1-\\frac{{\\mathrm d}\\log\\tilde\\mu(r)}{{\\mathrm d}\\log r},\\ ] ] is the effective index for the gravitational potential .",
    "finally , the surface term is given by @xmath18 note that @xmath19 is the mean number density of the tracers in the sphere of the radius of @xmath9 .",
    "next , we observe from equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the tangential velocity and @xmath22 is the corresponding velocity dispersion .",
    "hence , equation ( [ eq : ae11 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath23 which is our desired result expressing the mass @xmath13 in terms of averages of observables .",
    "the same can also be derived by directly integrating equation ( [ eq : je ] ) whose left side reduces to    @xmath24    with an arbitrary weight @xmath25 , this then results in @xmath26 the first integral here reduces to @xmath27    through integration by parts .",
    "given that the inner boundary term @xmath28 vanishes , replacing the first integral in equation ( [ eq : jeint ] ) by equation ( [ eq : intp ] ) and multiplying the result by @xmath29 , we find that @xmath30 we recover equation ( [ eq : main ] ) by choosing @xmath31 since @xmath32 .",
    "* hereafter ead ) have demonstrated that for most practical purposes adopting the scale - free assumption is a good approximation for choosing the proper mass estimator .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the mass model is given by @xmath33 and so @xmath34 is constant .",
    "the exact models of the kepler potential ( a central point mass ) , the logarithmic potential ( a truncated singular isothermal sphere ) , and the harmonic potential ( a uniform homogeneous sphere ) correspond to the cases that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively . with the mass model of equation ( [ eq : mss ] ) ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : main ] ) reduces to @xmath38 given that the tracer density profile essentially vanishes at finite @xmath9 , the surface term should drop out ( unless they are pressure - confined with a hard cut - off ) . alternatively ,",
    "following , the surface term may be explicitly solved under the assumption of exact power - law behaviour for the tracer density ( @xmath39 ) and the velocity dispersions , although strictly speaking the resulting solutions can not be physical everywhere .",
    "it follows that @xmath40 is constant since the jeans equation implies that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 all follow the same power - law .",
    "therefore we can solve for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "if we substitute these for the surface term , then we find that : @xmath46 together with @xmath47 , equation ( [ eq : mep ] ) results in @xmath48 this is equivalent to equations ( 16 ) and ( 24 ) of if the anisotropy parameter is given by @xmath49 .      in reality",
    ", the scale - free mass model is a rather artificial abstraction .",
    "never the less , equation ( [ eq : mm ] ) is actually valid for any mass profile and arbitrary weights .",
    "hence with @xmath50 and further assuming that the surface term vanishes as @xmath51 , we have that @xmath52 we have used the symbol @xmath53 to emphasize the fact that this needs not be the same as the power - law index of the potential .",
    "that is to say , the scale - free estimator on the right - hand side actually returns the radial moments of any given ( not necessarily scale - free ) mass profile . although it is clear that the left - hand side is directly related to the total mass , the specific constant factor associated with it in general depends on both the mass profile and the tracer density profile .",
    "there are some exceptions that are worthy of note here .",
    "the first is the case of the power - law mass profile with @xmath54 , for which @xmath55 is constant regardless of the tracer density profile .",
    "the second is the self - consistent gravitating system for which the @xmath56 case results in @xmath57 because @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass density and the ratio @xmath60 is constant .",
    "( by contrast , for a central @xmath61 point - mass , we would have @xmath62 . )",
    "an additional general result deduced from equation ( [ eq : malp ] ) is for @xmath63 , that is , @xmath64 which is simply the scalar virial theorem for a spherical system .",
    ".mean values @xmath65 for satellites in table  1 of .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the estimator uses equation ( [ eq : mpp ] ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the mass is in the units of @xmath68 .",
    "the uncertainties are purely statistical incorporating both scatters and the measurement uncertainties found in table  [ tab : pm ] .",
    "let us now estimate the benefits that _ gaia _ will bring .",
    "we do this by constructing mock datasets of los velocities and proper motions for sets of dwarf galaxy satellites extracted from a suite of simulations , the _ galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation _ , which are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "they consist of a set of hydrodynamical resimulations of five nearly spherical regions ( @xmath69 in radius ) extracted from the _ millennium simulation _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite extracted a set of galaxies that resemble the milky way .",
    "the catalogue consists of 431 parent haloes and 4864 associated satellite galaxies .",
    "the mass estimators provide the total mass within the radius of the farthest tracer ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we compute the ` true ' mass within the virial radius of each halo and compare to the masses found via our estimator .",
    "we use all satellites , but check that our results are not significantly affected when only luminous satellites are included . figure  [ fig : sims ]",
    "refers to data sets of radial velocities and true distances ( dashed histogram ) , and radial velocities , proper motions and projected distances ( solid histogram ) .",
    "an uncertainty of 100  @xmath71as  a@xmath72for each star is assumed ; for comparison , _ gaia _ s targeted accuracies are 10  @xmath71as  a@xmath72at @xmath73 and 150  @xmath71as  a@xmath72at @xmath74 @xcite . for each tangential velocity measurement ,",
    "a gaussian distribution centred on the ` real measurement ' with error is derived from the proper motion ( and so depends on distance ) . for each satellite",
    ", it is assumed that _ gaia _",
    "will detect 100 stars , which is reasonable enough for the case of the satellites of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : sims ] uses the estimator given by equation ( [ eq : mpp ] ) , the right panel uses equation ( [ eq : mep ] ) neglecting the surface term .",
    "we quantify the improvement by means of two statistical measures as originally introduced by .",
    "first , we define the fraction of reasonable estimates ( fre ) as the fraction of estimates within the factor of two of the true mass ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we also give the inter quartile range ( iqr ) of the mass estimates , which gives a good indication of the spread .",
    "we see that at _ gaia _ s accuracy , the proper motions can contribute significantly to an improved estimate of the mass of the milky way .",
    "even with the small number of satellites , the inclusion of proper motion data via the estimator of equation ( [ eq : mpp ] ) means that 93 per cent of estimates are within a factor of two , as opposed to 82 per cent with radial velocities alone .",
    "the solid histogram is also more narrow than the dashed , as indicated by a smaller iqr of @xmath75 .",
    "notice from the right panel that the estimator of equation ( [ eq : mep ] ) also performs very well with regard to the fre , but the neglect of the boundary term causes an offset so the estimator is biased .    as is noted by ,",
    "there are a number of ways in which mock catalogues from simulations differ from the assumptions used to derive the estimators . for example",
    ", dark haloes are not generally spherical , infall continues to the present day , and the observed satellites are not necessarily virialized and well - described by an equilibrium distribution . therefore the performance of the mass estimators is very encouraging .",
    "in most practical cases , the kinematic data available are limited by projection .",
    "hence , the naturally observable velocity dispersions are those along the line of sight and of proper motions . in addition",
    ", for most dynamical systems of interest , their spatial extents are typically much smaller than their distances from us as a whole . on the positive side",
    ", this indicates that , from the observer s perspective , the observed los velocities @xmath76 basically correspond to the coordinate velocity component @xmath77 if we have chosen the cylindrical polar coordinate centred at the centre of the tracer population and the positive @xmath78-axis running from the centre to the observer .",
    "in addition , the remaining two orthogonal components of the velocity @xmath79 are linearly proportional to the two components of the proper motion with @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the distance to the system as a whole and @xmath82 is the proper motion vector .    on the negative side",
    "however , the radial distance of any individual tracer to the centre of the system is very difficult to determine precisely . in particular , since the absolute uncertainty ( @xmath83 ) of the radial distance ( @xmath84 ) measurement is in the same order as the uncertainty ( @xmath85 ) of the individyal distance ( @xmath81 ) measurement , i.e. , @xmath86 ( nb .",
    ", the error in the distance measurement typically dominates that in the angular separation whilst the precise determination of the distance to the centre only improves the precision by @xmath87 ) , the fractional uncertainty of the radial distance is roughly estimated to be @xmath88 where @xmath89 is of order the angular extent of the system .",
    "in other words , @xmath90 per cent estimates of the radial distances for tracers in a degree - sized system require the individual distance measurement in a better than @xmath91 per cent precision .",
    "consequently , the distance handle associated with the tracer is likely to be limited to the projected ( linear or angular , depending on whether the distance to the system as a whole is known or not ) separation . in the following ,",
    "we develop the projected mass estimators similar to those of @xcite and @xcite using @xmath76 and @xmath92 as observables but further augmented by including the transverse velocity @xmath93 derived from the proper motion .",
    "we note that this problem has been partly addressed by @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the coordinate system with its origin located at the centre of the system and the positive @xmath78-axis running from the origin to us .",
    "then , the tracer velocity components in the spherical polar coordinate @xmath94 transform to those in the cylindrical coordinate @xmath95 according to @xmath96 if the tracers are described by a generic two - integral distribution that is non - rotating and spherically symmetric , then the velocity dispersion tensor is diagonalized in the spherical polar coordinate with @xmath97 .",
    "these transform to the velocity dispersion tensor in the cylindrical polar coordinate via @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and @xmath40 is given by equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) .    using equation ( [ eq : sigt ] ) , it is trivial to find for @xmath101 that    [ eq : vra]@xmath102",
    "\\end{split}\\\\ \\left\\langle v_\\phi^2r^\\alpha\\right\\rangle & = ( 3+\\alpha)b_\\alpha\\langle v_\\theta^2r^\\alpha\\rangle \\\\ \\left\\langle v_z^2r^\\alpha\\right\\rangle & = b_\\alpha\\left[\\langle v_r^2r^\\alpha\\rangle + ( 2+\\alpha)\\langle v_\\theta^2r^\\alpha\\rangle\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the beta and gamma function and @xmath105    the result extends to the @xmath37 case ( homogeneous sphere ) with    [ eq : alp2 ] @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the dirac delta .",
    "since @xmath108 and @xmath109 correspond to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we find from equation ( [ eq : sigt ] ) that @xmath112    this result is identified with the formal limit of equation ( [ eq : vra ] ) as @xmath113 once we note that @xmath114 .    for an observer located sufficiently far away , the axial and sectional velocities are basically the los and the transverse velocities , respectively .",
    "it follows that @xmath115 and @xmath116.\\ ] ] if the two components of the transverse velocities are separately measurable , we can derive the right - hand of equation ( [ eq : malp ] ) from    @xmath117.\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the same may be found by combining the los and the two - dimensional transverse velocity dispersions @xmath118.\\ ] ]    directly substituting these in equation ( [ eq : malp ] ) then leads to    @xmath119    which is again valid for @xmath101 .",
    "we note that equation ( [ eq : pmep ] ) with @xmath120 are already found in @xcite . if @xmath37 , then strictly the average is not convergent , but using equation ( [ eq : alp2 ] ) , we find the proper limiting equation , namely , @xmath121 whereas @xmath122 .",
    "provided that the distance @xmath81 to the system as a whole is known independently , equation ( [ eq : pmep ] ) is the proper extension of the projected mass estimator to include the information from proper motions .",
    "note that , if the vectorial dispersion of the proper motions is known , incorporating the los velocity dispersions in fact over - constrains the system under the assumption of the two - integral spherically - symmetric distribution .",
    "we can test these formulae in the context of applications .",
    "a possible class of targets would be nearby dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies , similar to the examples found in .",
    "however , the proper motion dispersion for an imaginary satellite of mass @xmath123 and radius 0.5  kpc located at 50  kpc is about @xmath124 . even with _ gaia _ , these will be challenging observations even if there exist large enough samples of sufficiently luminous tracers , which is itself unclear in any case .",
    "alternatively , we can consider mass estimates of galactic globular clusters .",
    "in fact , for a few bright clusters , there already exist very good internal proper motion data sets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "yet the existing data for these are sufficiently large and of high quality so that the complete dynamical modelling is technically feasible ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * )  note that there is no degeneracy involving anisotropy with the proper motion data incorporated . in principle",
    ", we may still utilize these for the projected mass estimator but its application is clearly didactic at best .",
    "instead we investigate _ gaia _ s capability regarding possible applications of projected mass estimators for ` typical ' globular clusters in varying distances .",
    "in contrast to dwarf satellites , the main challenge of globular cluster observations is expected to be crowding , and so the choice of the tracer subsample is important for any practical application of mass estimators .",
    "blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars have a @xmath125-band magnitude of about @xmath126 at 50  kpc .",
    "so , _ gaia _ will be able to detect a bhb star out to 50  kpc and measure their proper motions with accuracies of better than 100  @xmath71as  a@xmath72 .",
    "by contrast , radial velocities will usually be missing , as _ gaia _ s radial velocity spectrograph has a limiting magnitude of @xmath127 .",
    "most globular clusters harbour significant populations of bhb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so equation ( [ eq : pmep ] ) can be exploited to measure the mass of globular clusters in the milky way from proper motions provided by _ gaia_. to test the feasibility , we use the the self - consistent distributions of power - law densities with @xmath128 in logarithmic potentials @xcite to generate mock datasets of proper motions and projected distances , degraded with the _ gaia _ errors . the estimated mass computed via equation ( [ eq : pmep ] ) can then be compared to the known true mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : simstwo ] shows the results of monte carlo simulations . in the left panel ,",
    "the globular cluster is assumed to lie at a distance of 5  kpc and the sample size is 10 or 100 tracers with projected positions and proper motions . as the histograms are quite tight , we have replaced fre with the fraction of good estimates ( fge ) , where `` good '' means that the mass estimate is within 10 per cent of the true mass .",
    "we see that 10 tracers are too small for reliable results , but 100 tracers are ample .",
    "the right panel shows the estimated masses as a function of distance , with the globular cluster assumed to lie at 5 , 20 and 50  kpc respectively . in each case , 100 tracers are used , and we see that the results are still acceptable at distances of 20  kpc , with 67 per cent of the mass estimates being good . with increasing distance , however",
    ", the accuracy degrades so that by 50  kpc , only 24 per cent of the estimates are good .",
    "now we consider the case that the distance @xmath81 is also unknown .",
    "it can in principle be measured by matching the los velocity and the proper motion dispersions .",
    "specifically , the last equality of equation ( [ eq : pmep ] ) is rearranged to @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath80 where @xmath131 is the angular separation from the centre , the distance @xmath81 is found from direct observables as in @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the radial and azimuthal projections of the proper motion .",
    "note that the @xmath36 case reduces to @xmath135 irrespective of the anisotropy , which corresponds to the classical statistical parallax technique of measuring distance .",
    "this is because only in the @xmath136 case are the velocity distributions independent of position , which usually assumed in statistical parallax applications ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the same time",
    ", we can also solve for the anisotropy parameter @xmath137 } { ( 3+\\alpha)\\left\\langle\\mu_r^2\\varphi^\\alpha\\right\\rangle -\\left\\langle\\mu_\\phi^2\\varphi^\\alpha\\right\\rangle}.\\ ] ] the unique mass estimator that follows this is @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "this again is in fact equivalent to equations ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) of with @xmath40 replaced by equation ( [ eq : beff ] ) and the boundary term dropped .",
    "if one preferred the explicitly solved boundary term used in , one might use their equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) with @xmath40 replaced by the same equation ( [ eq : beff ] ) .",
    "however , we note that estimators in equations ( [ eq : s2])-([eq : mproj ] ) are likely to be biased if the sample means are used to estimate for the averages in the right - hand sides as these formulae involve a division by a mean whose corresponding dispersion is finite non - zero .",
    "hitherto , proper motion data have not normally been used in measurements of the mass of nearby galaxies like the milky way and m31 .",
    "proper motions are only available for a handful of satellites  namely , carina , draco , fornax , sculptor , sextans , ursa minor and the large and small magellanic clouds for the milky way , together with ic10 and m33 for m31 . as these are difficult measurements , the errors are often quite large .",
    "additionally , agreement between different investigators regarding the proper motions for ursa minor @xcite and sculptor @xcite is poor .",
    "therefore , there has been little attention given to their exploitation .",
    "this situation is about to change .",
    "the _ gaia _ satellite , to be launched in 2013 , will measure the positions and proper motions of @xmath140 stars in our galaxy and other members of the local group .",
    "the proper motions have a targeted accuracy of between 10  @xmath71as  a@xmath72(at @xmath73 ) and 150  @xmath71as  a@xmath72(at @xmath74 ) .",
    "this therefore motivates detailed study of the use of proper motions in mass estimators . particularly in the case of the milky way ,",
    "the proper motions are crucial as the line - of - sight velocity closely coincides with the radial velocity as measured from the galactic centre .",
    "hence , proper motions provide new information on the velocity anisotropy that is not available in the line - of - sight velocities alone .",
    "here we have shown how to solve the classical problem of estimating the enclosed mass from the positions and space velocities of a set of tracers .",
    "the main result is equation ( [ eq : main ] ) , which shows how to compute the enclosed mass in terms of averages over the observable velocity components for a given halo mass model .",
    "if , as is reasonable , we use a scale - free assumption for the dark halo , then the mass estimator reduces to equation ( [ eq : mpp ] ) .",
    "note values of @xmath141 for the power - law index for the potential are good approximations to the nfw halo @xcite .",
    "we have used these new formulae to demonstrate that the existing proper motion data for the milky way satellites provide no meaningful discriminating information on the mass of the milky way .",
    "this though will change in the era of _ gaia_. using mock catalogues of satellites extracted from the simulations , we have shown that our new mass estimator , when equipped with proper motions with the targeted _ gaia _ accuracies , significantly outperforms the estimator used with line - of - sight velocities only . we have also given the extension of the formulae to the instances where projected positions and proper motions are available .",
    "these formulae provide a feasible method for the _ gaia _ satellite to measure the internal masses of milky way globular clusters lying within 20  kpc .",
    "as is usual for a spherical system , we have assumed no rotation in the tracer population for our derivation of the mass estimators .",
    "( clearly , any rotating population can not be spherically symmetric although it may be spherical in density . )",
    "however , the tracer velocities in our formulae appear as their second moments rather than the dispersions / variances ( in the rest frame of the potential ) .",
    "that is , once the bulk _ linear _ motion of the tracers is subtracted , the estimators actually do not distinguish between the random and coherent motions of the tracers .",
    "hence , we argue that the formulae as they are are still valid even if the population is in fact supported through the mixture of the pressure and the rotation .",
