    "black hole x - ray transients ( bhxrts ) , also known as x - ray novae and soft x - ray transients , are low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) which undergo dramatic x - ray , optical , and radio outbursts , separated by years , decades or even longer periods of quiescence ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the class is diverse , with orbital periods of 4hrs to a few days to a month .",
    "outburst behavior is similarly varied . among these , however , are a sub - group which show relatively consistent behavior and these are thought of as the ` typical ' members of the class . they are often compared to the prototypical bhxrt , a062000 ( see @xcite for a review ) . in such a typical outburst , the x - ray emission is usually ( but not always , see @xcite ) dominated by thermal emission from the hot inner accretion disk , and uv and optical emission is thought to be produced by reprocessing of x - rays by the outer disk .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to characterize the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these bhxrts in outburst . @xcite and @xcite attempted to use simple disk spectral models , and other authors",
    "have used a variety of black bodies and power - laws .",
    "these mostly only consider a single source at a time , use a variety of extinction curves and reddening determination methods , and do not use comparable spectral models .",
    "consequently it is difficult to compare the data on different sources and attempt to draw broad conclusions about the population as a whole .",
    "the goal of this paper is to bring together all of the useful data on a suitable homogeneous sample of sources , with recalibrations where appropriate for the satellite data .",
    "it is then possible to deredden the spectra consistently and draw direct empirical conclusions about the observed seds .",
    "we can also go on to compare the complete sample with simple models in a consistent way .",
    "finally we can hope that this compilation will provide a reference set as more sophisticated disk spectral models are developed .",

    "( mjd 51467 ) & 9.1 & @xmath17 & 0.49 & ( @xmath18 ) +    studies of these broad - band seds are important as they can inform us about the temperature structure within the binary .",
    "they are especially useful for the typical bhxrt systems considered , as these mostly have very small mass ratios , hence the emission from reprocessing on the companion star is weak , and the systems so far discovered have intermediate or low inclinations , so disk self obscuration and limb darkening should not be large effects . in these cases",
    "the comparison between observed sed and disk temperature structure should be relatively direct .",
    "one must of course assume an emergent spectrum for the disk . at present ,",
    "black bodies are probably as good an approximation as any for optically thick disks in x - ray binaries , but we can anticipate models including a more rigorous treatment of the disk atmosphere in the future .",
    "the observed sed essentially can tell us the distribution of emitting area as a function of temperature . given assumptions such as axisymmetry and a monotonic dependence of temperature on radius",
    "then one can map this area  temperature relation into the radial temperature distribution , but the more generalized statement is useful in considering more complex geometries which could be imagined , such as disks which are warped or exhibit spiral waves . in this more general case ,",
    "given a three - dimensional disk geometry , a model for the irradiation geometry ( e.g.  an isotropically emitting point source , or perhaps a flat central disk ) , and some method to calculate emergent spectra ( at its simplest , a black body ) , one can test specific models against the observed spectra , and falsify some combinations .",
    "there is certainly more than enough uncertainty about the temperature structure of irradiated disks to warrant seeking further observational constraints .",
    "for example , theoretical work suggests that disks should be self - shielding ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and hence that irradiation requires scattering of x - rays or warping of the disk @xcite .",
    "these two cases may produce very different temperature structures .",
    "an understanding of irradiation geometry has immediate application in providing input to numerical models of bhxrt outbursts , as these models have to make some assumptions about the strength , and radial dependence , of x - ray heating ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we begin in section  [ selectionsection ] by defining our sample of bhxrts . in section  [ reddeningsection ]",
    "we review and evaluate reddening determinations for these sources , in particular incorporating a reanalysis of 2175  bump data for some sources .",
    "this section also discusses the importance of the extinction curve adopted .",
    "section  [ distancesection ] discusses corresponding distance estimates .",
    "we then proceed to review the database of spectra available based on satellite observations ( mainly uv ) in section  [ satellitesection ] , and ground - based observations ( optical ) in section  [ opticalsection ] .",
    "having collated our sample spectra , we then compare the optical spectra in section  [ opticalsedsection ] and the broader - band optical - uv spectra in section  [ uvsedsection ] .",
    "we next take an interlude to evaluate the effect of reddening uncertainties upon the spectra in section  [ dereddenvarsection ] before comparing the spectra with disk models in section  [ modelsection ] .",
    "in section  [ discussionsection ] we compare our results with other studies and with theoretical work . finally in section  [ conclusionsection ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions and consider where progress can most effectively be made in the future .",
    "we restrict our sample of sources in order to obtain a relatively homogeneous set of spectra .",
    "our selection criteria are as follows .",
    "firstly we consider only sources which are believed to harbor a black hole . in most cases",
    "this selection is based on a dynamical mass estimate , but where this is not available , more subjective criteria are used . any source exhibiting type i x - ray bursts",
    "is obviously excluded .",
    "secondly we exclude those sources with an orbital period greater than one day .",
    "most long period objects exhibit unusual outbursts , several have companions luminous enough to contribute even during outburst and the large disks expected in these systems may well behave rather differently to those in the short period systems .",
    "finally we only include high luminosity systems showing a ` canonical ' lightcurve , i.e.  one with a fast rise and quasi - exponential decay .",
    "specifically we exclude xte  j1118 + 480 ; this seems appropriate as this source exhibited an unusually faint outburst and the optical light probably includes significant non - disk emission , likely of a synchrotron origin ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". for the sources included , only spectra from the exponential decay phase of the lightcurve are used , i.e.  we exclude mini - outburst spectra .",
    "an additional practical criterion is of course that there must exist flux - calibrated spectra .",
    "based on these criteria we obtain a primary sample of sources with relatively complete optical and uv coverage and a secondary sample with only optical spectra .",
    "our primary sample includes a  062000 , gs  1124684 , gro  j0422 + 32 , and xtej1859 + 226 .",
    "our secondary sample adds grs  100945 , and grs  1716249 .",
    "we initially included gs  2000 + 25  in the secondary sample , as a fluxed spectrum was presented by @xcite and it otherwise meets our selection criteria .",
    "when we came to estimate the reddening , however , it was clear that it was too large , and too uncertain , for a meaningful derivation of the intrinsic spectral energy distribution , so we have not attempted an analysis of this spectrum . for all of the other targets selected @xmath19 and is relatively well determined .",
    "all of these objects also lie at least @xmath20 from the galactic plane .    for the sources considered ,",
    "the optical and uv emission should be dominated by the disk , although the ir may in some cases include a synchrotron component ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , so we do not include ir coverage .",
    "since most bhxrts lie at significant distances , they are typically rather reddened objects , hence a reliable correction for interstellar reddening is crucial if we are to accurately reconstruct the spectral energy distribution .",
    "this correction depends upon two things : the determination of the reddening value , typically parameterized in @xmath5 , and an extinction curve specifying the amount of extinction as a function of wavelength . for a review of the problem see @xcite .",
    "a number of methods are available to estimate the reddening , but they vary considerably in their reliability .",
    "the most direct measures are not necessarily the best ; these include the optical color ( e.g.@xmath21 ) or emission line ratios .",
    "these do directly measure the differential extinction as a function of wavelength , but their interpretation is model dependent .",
    "less direct methods can be more independent of assumptions about the target , but instead involve assumed properties for the line - of - sight material , for example the gas to dust ratio , the abundance of nai , or the strength of the 2175  absorption feature relative to the broader structure in the extinction curve .",
    "several approaches also exist for choosing an extinction curve , as discussed by @xcite . as we typically have no independent information on the properties of the interstellar medium toward a bhxrt",
    ", we will adopt the @xcite @xmath22 extinction curve as this should be the ` best ' current galactic average curve . in analyzing our results",
    "we must then remember that our uncertainties depend not only on the uncertain amount of extinction but the uncertain shape of the extinction curve .",
    "our preferred method to estimate the amount of extinction is to measure the strength of the 2175  interstellar absorption feature . in fitting the feature",
    "we must assume some underlying spectral shape , either fixed or with some free parameters , and then adjust @xmath23 to fit the data .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the strength of the feature is one of the variable characteristics of the uv extinction curve ; hence the correlation between the 2175feature and @xmath5 is not perfect , and the intrinsic variance in their relative values introduces an unavoidable 20percent error in reddenings determined in this way @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty can only be avoided if the relative strength of the feature for the line of sight is known independently from nearby stars , which is only the case for one of our sources , a  062000  @xcite . in spite of these limitations ,",
    "the method is generally more precise than the alternatives .",
    "the equivalent width of the nad interstellar doublet can in principle be used to estimate the reddening , and calibrations exist for this purpose .",
    "the problem is that _ several _ calibrations exist and these do not agree . @xcite",
    "derive @xmath24 from observations of supernovae in external galaxies .",
    "@xcite on the other hand obtained @xmath25 by analyzing the data of @xcite on southern supergiants .",
    "furthermore , as noted by @xcite , the nad lines are not in general sensitive to @xmath26 due to saturation , so this method can underestimate the reddening ; whether it does or not depends on the detailed substructure of the lines which is not usually resolved .",
    "some caution should therefore be exercised in applying this method .",
    "in addition to the nad lines , relations between the equivalent widths of diffuse interstellar bands and @xmath5 are commonly used .",
    "@xcite performed an extensive study and tabulated relations for 17 interstellar bands in the 44006850  range .",
    "the correlation between different lines was found to be very good but there were significant regional effects .",
    "another approach taken is to adopt scaling ratios between interstellar gas and dust densities , usually expressed in a regression relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 or @xmath5 .",
    "this method is plagued with uncertainty , both due to intrinsic variance in this ratio , and due to different measures of @xmath27 ; it may be measured directly though uv ly@xmath29 absorption ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) or indirectly through soft x - ray absorption which also includes metallic absorption ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) ; for the latter it is necessary to assume abundances .",
    "we will adopt the relation of @xcite : @xmath30@xmath31 , as this relation is relatively direct and conveniently falls intermediate between the other estimates referred to .",
    "these authors note that individual sources typically scatter by 30percent around this line , and adopting this uncertainty encompasses the other average relationships as well .",
    "an additional concern for measurements of n@xmath32 is the possible presence of local absorption intrinsic to the source .",
    "the local absorbing material will probably be too hot to include a dusty component , so will not contribute to the optical / uv absorption .",
    "some authors assume a typical intrinsic @xmath33 color in outburst , and hence derive a direct estimate of @xmath5 . for our purposes , however , this assumption is extremely dangerous ; to use such estimates without independent corroboration would lead to a circular logic .",
    "we would be assuming that the intrinsic spectra of all bhxrts are the same to determine their reddening and hence derive their intrinsic spectrum .    a direct measure of the reddening of the spectrum",
    "can alternatively be obtained from the balmer decrement , by assuming line ratios appropriate for case b recombination ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this approach is obviously dependent upon the assumption that case b line ratios are appropriate , and so is also not a very secure method .",
    "a final technique , of more use for extragalactic work , is to use maps of galactic dust , for example @xcite .",
    "the problem with applying this technique to galactic objects is that it only yields the total amount of reddening along that line of sight , some of which may be behind the target .",
    "this technique is thus mainly useful as an upper limit , although some sources such as gro  j0422 + 32  are believed to lie above the dusty component of the galactic disk .",
    "an additional concern is that these maps do not resolve fine extinction structure and so are only reliable for sources above or below the galactic plane ; @xcite recommend only trusting @xmath34 .",
    "fortunately , the nature of our sample is such that highly reddened objects in the plane have been excluded , and all of our targets happen to lie outside of this band .",
    "we therefore apply this technique , remembering that it may include background extinction . in most cases",
    "the reddening estimated in this way is comparable to , or somewhat larger than , other methods so it does seem to be of use , at least for high latitude x - ray binaries .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath35 for a  062000  from fitting _",
    "ans _  uv data through 2175  feature .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used spectra from 25 nearby early type stars to derive a line - of - sight extinction curve for a  062000 .",
    "it was found that the 2175  feature was rather stronger along this line - of - sight than average , and hence they derived a revised lower estimate of @xmath36 .",
    "the uncertainty in this estimate will be similar to the earlier measurement ; since they used a line - of - sight extinction curve there is no need to account for a 20percent error due to uncertainty in the intrinsic 2175  strength . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath37 , with a large uncertainty , from the nad lines .",
    "they note , however , that the dibs seem unusually strong for the reddening derived .",
    "@xcite collated the dib measurements and confirmed this conclusion .",
    "they emphasize , however , that the strength of dibs as a function of @xmath5 does vary with galactic longitude , and that a  062000  lies within @xmath20 of the region where the dibs are relatively strongest .",
    "using appropriate relations for this longitude they derive @xmath38 or @xmath39 , depending on the relation used .",
    "the reddening derived from optical interstellar features is therefore broadly consistent with that obtained from the uv . both are lower than the value of 0.49 derived from dust maps @xcite but a  062000  is the closest of our objects and background extinction is expected .",
    "we adopt the _ ans _",
    "value of @xmath6 for the remainder of this work .",
    "gs  1124684  was among the best studied in the uv with a series of _",
    "iue_observations @xcite early in the outburst and a later , higher signal - to - noise _ hst _  one @xcite .",
    "these permit fitting of the 2175  feature to derive @xmath5 . @xcite",
    "derive @xmath40 using this method and @xcite obtain @xmath41 from considerably higher signal - to - noise data .",
    "both use the @xcite extinction law . repeating the analysis of the _ hst _  data using the @xcite extinction curve , and a more realistic estimate of the accuracy of the method , we derive @xmath42 from these data in section  [ hstsection ] , consistent with both of the earlier estimates .",
    "from interstellar absorption lines , @xcite obtain two values : 0.3 from applying the calibration of @xcite to the nad lines ( with a measured equivalent width of 1.4 ) and 0.35 using the calibration of @xcite on the 5778 , 5780 , 5797  absorption bands .",
    "these are consistent with the uv determination .",
    "the hydrogen column density has been estimated from _ ginga _  data alone as about @xmath43@xmath44 @xcite , and from _",
    "ginga_and _ rosat _",
    "spectra at @xmath45@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "these imply reddenings of @xmath46 and 0.4 respectively , which are just about consistent with optical estimates given the uncertainty in the relation between the two .",
    "for the remainder of this work we will adopt our revised estimate based on the 2175  feature : @xmath42 .",
    "as for a  062000 , this is slightly lower than was derived from dust maps , 0.37 .",
    "the 2175  feature in gro  j0422 + 32  has been measured by @xcite using _ iue _  data .",
    "they obtain @xmath47 .",
    "we have repeated the analysis using a more recent extinction curve and obtain a range of values of 0.290.48 , depending on the spectral range modeled and the underlying spectrum which is assumed ( see section  [ iuesection ] ) .",
    "many authors have also attempted to derive a reddening from interstellar lines . @xcite",
    "suggest @xmath48 based on 4428  and 6613  dibs .",
    "@xcite also obtain @xmath49 from the 5780  dib .",
    "finally @xcite measure equivalent widths of @xmath50  for the nad lines and @xmath51  for the 5780/5788/5797  group . using the relations of @xcite and",
    "@xcite they deduce @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite examine 12 stars in the field surrounding gro  j0422 + 32  and find that their color - color diagram needs to be dereddened by @xmath53 in order to match the unreddened main sequence .",
    "this method assumes that all these stars , and gro  j0422 + 32 , are subject to the same reddening ; it would be appropriate if all are above the main plane of extinction .",
    "even if some are not , but gro  j0422 + 32  is ( as seems likely given the estimated distance for gro  j0422 + 32 ) , then this value becomes a lower limit .",
    "@xcite fit absorbed power - laws to _ asca _  spectra from the 1993 august mini - outburst to obtain @xmath54@xmath44 , corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "finally , and most recently , @xcite derive @xmath56 from fitting the _ quiescent _ spectral energy distribution , but this value is somewhat sensitive to assumptions about the amount and color of disk light .",
    "there is clearly little close consensus on the reddening value , and even the method which is usually most precise , fitting the 2175  feature , yields equivocal results .",
    "consequently , based on the spread in measured values we adopt @xmath57 .",
    "this choice is rather arbitrary , but is representative of the scatter between the derived estimates .",
    "it is completely consistent with the estimate of 0.36 from dust maps .",
    "@xcite present several arguments for a low reddening in grs  100945 , @xmath58 . from the strength of nad absorption they derive an estimate of @xmath59 , with an upper limit of @xmath60 .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic @xmath33 color is similar to other lmxbs implies a consistent value of @xmath61 ( although see caution above ) .",
    "we follow these authors in adopting @xmath62 .",
    "the column density is not well constrained , but probably @xmath63@xmath44 @xcite , which implies @xmath64 , consistent with the optical estimates .",
    "finally dust maps predict @xmath65 , consistent with other estimates .",
    "the reddening of grs  1716249  has been estimated by @xcite as @xmath66 based on a number of arguments giving roughly consistent values .",
    "the strength of the nad lines implies @xmath67 ( see the note on saturation of these lines above ) .",
    "the strength of dibs suggests @xmath680.9 .",
    "arguments based on the outburst @xmath33 color , and the balmer decrement give somewhat higher values , but are model dependent as discussed above .",
    "the interstellar hydrogen column density has been estimated at @xmath69@xmath44 ( tanaka 1993 ) , implying @xmath70@xmath71 , which is consistent with the optical estimates .",
    "finally , dust maps imply @xmath72 . in summary , we see no compelling reason to amend the estimate of @xcite , leaving this as the largest and most uncertain reddening in our sample .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath73 using the well defined 2175  interstellar feature .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath74 from the 5780  dib .",
    "estimates of the hydrogen column density included @xmath75@xmath76 ( @xcite from _ sax_data ) and @xmath77@xmath44 ( @xcite ; _ rxte _ ) .",
    "this column density corresponds to @xmath78@xmath79 , allowing for the uncertainty and variance in the gas - dust ratio . even with this uncertainty , and that in the 2175determination , there is then a discrepancy .",
    "in contrast , dust maps imply an even lower value , @xmath80 .",
    "the 2175  value thus represents a reasonable middle - ground , so we will use this estimate , and the derived dereddened spectra from @xcite .",
    "the determination of distances to bhxrts is even more problematic than their reddenings , since there are no direct measures of distance .",
    "ideally , we would seek some kind of standard candle to determine the distance . for neutron star lmxbs",
    ", a standard candle does exist in the form of radius expansion type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "no such analog exists for black holes , and any attempt to use the outburst luminosity , as done by some authors , runs into a circular logic problem again , that we would be artificially forcing uniformity on our sample before comparing them .",
    "the only reasonably robust method that has been applied to our sample is to use the quiescent companion star .",
    "system parameters provide estimates of the companion s temperature and radius , and hence absolute magnitude , albeit with a large uncertainty in many cases .",
    "given the observed magnitude , estimated extinction and the fraction of quiescent light due to the disk ( the veiling ) we can then derive a distance .",
    "the errors are likely to be large , but are representative of the real uncertainty in knowing the distance , and other methods are likely to be even worse .",
    "the best method to assess the errors is to perform a simple simulation , constructing a population of model binaries consistent to within the observational uncertainties and derive a distance for each one , and hence a mean distance and standard deviation .",
    "this method has recently been applied to a number of our sources using ir data .",
    "this is preferable because the ir derived distance is less sensitive to uncertainty in extinction or companion temperature than the optical is .",
    "the best estimate is for a  062000  for which @xcite derive @xmath7kpc . for gs  1124684  @xcite quote @xmath81kpc with no uncertainty , but this estimate was subsequently refined with simulations as above to @xmath9kpc @xcite . for gro",
    "j0422 + 32  @xcite estimate @xmath11kpc and finally for grs  100945  @xcite derive @xmath13kpc .",
    "of course , these are not the only estimates for these sources .",
    "however we believe they are the most thorough and reflect the most up to date parameter estimates .",
    "these estimates are broadly consistent with previous values .",
    "some concerns do still exist for these objects in that these estimates , and their quoted uncertainties , depend on the limits placed upon the veiling .",
    "the works cited generally assume rather small veilings in the ir , and while this assumption is widely made , its validity is questionable @xcite . the most immediate effect of increasing the veiling is to reduce the apparent brightness of the companion star , implying a larger distance .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that the distances are underestimated somewhat . for more detailed discussion of these issues",
    "see @xcite .    for the other two of our selected sources ,",
    "the information necessary to use the quiescent companion as a standard candle is simply not all available yet , so in these cases we make use of other indicators from the literature .",
    "the distance to grs  1716249  is the poorest determined in our sample .",
    "@xcite estimate 2kpc from relations between nad equivalent width and distance .",
    "since the nad lines could well be saturated for the relatively high extinction of this object , this distance is really only a lower limit , even assuming that the mean relation is valid along this line of sight .",
    "based on the peak optical brightness , these authors estimate an upper limit of 2.8kpc , but as noted above we should be cautious about using such measurements for our purposes . in this case , however , we have little other information to go on and follow @xcite in adopting @xmath82kpc for grs  1716249 .",
    "the true uncertainty may well be larger , however , and the distance could be significantly greater .",
    "the distance to xte  j1859 + 226  is also problematic .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath83kpc from both the brightness of the outburst and that of the quiescent companion .",
    "the latter estimate was , however , based largely upon guesses for a number of binary parameters including the orbital period and companion spectral type .",
    "@xcite report spectroscopy indicating an orbital period longer than assumed by @xcite and an earlier spectral type .",
    "both effects will tend to make the quiescent companion more luminous and hence push the source to a larger distance .",
    "we have done a simulation similar to those discussed above to test these effects , and estimate that the quiescent brightness implies a distance of @xmath84kpc assuming the constraints of @xcite .",
    "this value depends on some uncertain or totally unknown parameters , however , such as the inclination and mass ratio .",
    "the disk veiling is also ignored and a significant disk contribution would push the distance even higher .",
    "the faintness in quiescence therefore suggests a very large distance , large enough to conflict with other estimates .",
    "outburst x - ray observations place a likely constraint of 513kpc , based on a combination of spectral and timing information @xcite .",

    "@xcite interpreted the upturn in that case as due to a far - uv rise component of extinction which is weaker than in the @xcite extinction curve .",
    "the same could be true for gs  1124684 , and similarly introduces uncertainty in the dereddened far - uv spectrum .",
    "we therefore omitted these points from the fits .",
    ", i.e.  a purely irradiated disk . ]",
    "disk model fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ nmusfitfig ] , performed as for a  062000 .",
    "gs  1124684  is also best fitted by a model dominated by viscous heating , exhibiting uv - hard spectra at all epochs . a model with purely irradiative heating would not fit .",
    "the disk outer edge temperature is comparable to that in a  062000  at late times , but higher earlier , dropping from @xmath164k to @xmath165k ; a similar decline was found by @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath166kpc and @xmath167 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) we obtain disk radii of 1.43.0@xmath168 cm , comparable to the expected tidal truncation radius of @xmath159 cm . the scatter inferred in the radius may arise from the uncertainty in the optical spectral slope , since this uncertainty will affect the derived temperature , which in turn will be inversely correlated with the normalization .",
    "these data thus also appear approximately consistent with a lobe filling disk .",
    "the higher temperatures early on may indicate that the disk is indeed being tidally truncated , since the hot - phase of the disk should be able to extend to below 10000k if it were unbounded .",
    "the temperatures we estimate are higher than for a  062000 , even though the disk radius is expected to be comparable .",
    "a higher temperature implies a larger mass flow rate ( if the spectrum is indeed due to viscous heating ) .",
    "note that this conclusion is largely independent of distance uncertainties , provided both disks are tidally truncated .",
    "@xcite indirectly provide support for this conclusion .",
    "they compare the x - ray lightcurves and estimate a flux scaling factor of @xmath169 for the ratio of a  062000  to gs  1124684 .",
    "they argue that the overall flux level of the two outbursts should be the same , assuming that the eddington scaled luminosity of the intermediate state should be constant .",
    "this is only expected , however , for extreme parameters , for example a black hole mass in a  062000  of just 4.5m@xmath162 is assumed . if we instead adopt current best estimates of the parameters @xcite , then we instead predict a flux scaling of @xmath170 , if the eddington scaled luminosities were the same",
    ". this scaling is uncertain , but significantly larger than observed , implying that a  062000  is underluminous relative to gs  1124684 , and hence that the accretion rate in gs  1124684  was likely larger .",
    "@xcite also note that the ratio of optical to x - ray flux is a factor of 1.6 larger in a  062000than in gs  1124684 , and attribute this difference to more efficient irradiation of the outer disk in a  062000 .",
    "there is another explanation , however .",
    "both the optical and x - ray bandpasses lie at the extreme ends of the spectral energy distribution , on the rayleigh - jeans and wien tails respectively .",
    "if the mass flow rate is higher , the effect is to increase the temperature throughout the disk and shift the sed out of the optical bandpass and into the x - ray one .",
    "such a difference is supported by the hotter optical / uv spectra inferred in gs  1124684 .",
    "this spectral shift will naturally decrease the optical to x - ray flux ratio without invoking any other changes .",
    "for example , consider two viscously heated disks around 10m@xmath162 black holes , with inner and outer radii of 3r@xmath171 and @xmath172 cm respectively .",
    "we adjust the mass flow rate to give outer disk temperatures of 8000k and 12000k respectively and calculate the ratio of @xmath173 band to x - ray flux ( 1.37.5kev ) .",
    "the ratio can change by at least a factor of two and possibly more , depending on the relative weighting across the x - ray bandpass and the effect of spectral hardening on the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this effect is more than adequate to explain the difference in the flux ratios between a  062000  and gs  1124684  without any irradiation effect .",
    "if we assume a 6.95m@xmath162 black hole in gs  1124684 , then we estimate mass flow rates of @xmath174m@xmath162yr@xmath92 , @xmath175m@xmath162yr@xmath92 , and @xmath176m@xmath162yr@xmath92 for epochs 13 respectively ( comparable to that obtained by @xcite assuming similar parameters ) .",
    "these values are superficially somewhat problematic , as the eddington limit should be reached for @xmath177m@xmath162yr@xmath92 , assuming 10%accretion efficiency . even with higher efficiencies , the early phase of the outburst",
    "should thus have involved super - eddington accretion .",
    "this is not a fatal problem , however , since the eddington limit strictly only applies to spherical accretion and a geometrically thin disk could deliver mildly super - eddington accretion rates . such a super - eddington model was indeed considered for gs  1124684  by @xcite , and @xcite also assumed a peak accretion rate somewhat above the eddington limit .",
    "a more pertinent question is whether such a large accretion rate can be reconciled with the observed thermal ( disk ) component in the x - ray spectrum of gs  1124684  @xcite .",
    "@xcite did address this question in the context of their spectral modeling and show that the two are consistent provided that compton scattering modifies the x - ray spectrum with a spectral hardening factor @xcite of @xmath178 .",
    "this factor is larger than the value of 1.7 usually adopted , but @xcite argued that values as large as 3 are plausible . if one accepts this correction then both the optical / uv spectrum , and the soft x - ray thermal component can be consistently interpreted with a purely viscously heated disk . as noted above for a  062000 , irradiation may still play a role in stabilizing the disk in the high viscosity state , but it is not required to provide the main energy input .",
    "we will consider an alternative explanation for the optical / uv spectrum in section  [ coronasection ] .      for gro  j0422 + 32",
    "we have two useful epochs with both _",
    "iue _  and optical data .",
    "these data may also suffer from similar problems with the far - uv rise component of extinction to gs  1124684  and gro  j0422 + 32 , but in the opposite sense , as there seems to be an enhanced drop off in flux at the shortest wavelengths",
    ".        fits to these data are shown in fig .",

    "this discrepancy could be resolved with a reduction in the source distance ( which is not totally impossible ; @xcite ) , with a more modest increase in the temperature ( which is factored into the large uncertainty in this derived radius ) , or if the inclination uncertainty is larger than assumed .",
    "we have seen that uv - hard spectra are ubiquitous , and can occur even when a bhxrt is at a high optical luminosity .",
    "it is common , at least in the field of x - ray binaries , to interpret such a spectrum as a signature of a viscously heated steady - state disk ( e.g.@xcite ) , and thus far we have done the same .",
    "this is not implausible , particularly in the case of a  062000  for which the required mass flow rate is not large .",
    "all this spectral form really indicates , however , is the temperature distribution , and that the heating rate varies as approximately @xmath186 .",
    "an alternative irradiation model is used by the young star community which actually predicts irradiative heating varying as @xmath186 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this model addresses the case where a circumstellar disk is irradiated by the stellar surface .",
    "the key difference is that since the star is not compact , it is not a point source , but an extended one which illuminates the disk from above . indeed a similar case which also produces @xmath186 heating arises from a ` lamppost ' model , where the source of x - rays are raised above the disk ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    as described in the appendix",
    ", one can produce uv - hard spectra with an elevated ( or vertically extended ) x - ray source .",
    "this behavior is generically expected , except for the specific case of a concave disk with a sufficiently compact x - ray source , possibly mediated by local scattering by an extended disk atmosphere .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that where irradiation is attributed to x - rays scattered by a central coronal source , one _ expects _",
    "@xmath186 heating , in contrast to the assumption usually made in modeling outburst behavior that irradiation drops off approximately as @xmath187 ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if x - ray scattering occurs in a highly vertically extended disk atmosphere , however , @xmath187 heating could still be appropriate .",
    "how plausible are these scenarios ?",
    "x - ray scattering ` coronae ' are certainly believed to be present in x - ray binaries .",
    "however , it is likely that coronae are not spherical , but very flattened , and represent a vertical extension of the disk atmosphere ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "effective illumination of a convex disk , with a vertically extended central corona , thus seems difficult to achieve , and hence this seems unlikely as a mechanism for producing uv - hard spectra .",
    "finally , we note that x - rays from a jet might provide an alternative ` lamppost ' illumination , either by direct synchrotron emission or by scattering .",
    "relativistic beaming might then be expected to considerably reduce the back - illumination of the disk , but large luminosities are not required , especially as the x - ray source could then be higher above the disk than is plausible for a corona .",
    "@xcite suggested that warping of disks may facilitate irradiation of disks which would otherwise be self - shielded , and this could also be expected to modify the radial dependence of the heating . @xcite",
    "have examined this question quantitatively .",
    "they do find strong variations in the radially averaged heating , but these are not as simple as the additional @xmath188 dependence that would be required to reproduce the @xmath189 spectra , although they do find that an average reprocessing efficiency of @xmath190 can readily be produced with a warped disk .",
    "while only a fraction of the disk is illuminated at any time , the effect of irradiation on the thermal structure of the disk will last for of order the local thermal timescale .",
    "this should be comparable to the local dynamical timescale ( i.e.  the keplerian rotation period ) , so heating effects will be azimuthally averaged as material rotates through the illuminated patch and hence the whole disk will be affected ( g. dubus , priv .",
    ". further investigation of the spectral energy distributions expected in the warped disk case is needed .",
    "@xcite do note , however , that the short - period bhxrts we are considering here are expected to be stable against radiation driven warping , so in the absence of another warping mechanism , it remains questionable whether warping can be an important factor for these objects .",
    "in light of the above discussion , we should reconsider the origin of the optical emission in bhxrts in outburst .",
    "it is sometimes stated that optical emission is always totally dominated by reprocessed x - rays .",
    "this may be true in neutron star systems , but there is good reason to _ expect _ irradiation to be weaker in the black hole case , as there is no direct emission from the compact object surface @xcite .",
    "this difference is invoked by these authors to explain the observations that black hole lmxbs are transient , whereas most analogous neutron star systems are persistent x - ray sources .",
    "the studies presented here suggest that the situation may be more marginal than usually assumed .",
    "if one interprets a @xmath2 spectrum as a signature of a viscously heated disk , then the answer is clearly no , as this spectrum occurs rather often among the population . in the case of a  062000 , at least",
    ", if one takes a plausible mass flow rate , and plausible disk size then viscous heating alone can readily explain the observed optical brightness .",
    "in the case of xte  j1859 + 226 , the sed can initially be interpreted as irradiation dominated , but a transition to the viscously dominated regime appears to occur suggesting that the irradiation dominance is rather marginal .",
    "of course this conclusion hinges upon one interpretation of the sed , but the alternatives considered are relatively unpalatable .",
    "irradiation by x - rays from a lamppost ( perhaps the jet ? ) , or by a vertically extended corona could reproduce the observed sed , but requires an excessive luminosity for the extended source and/or a rather large vertical extent .",
    "we thus appear left with viscous heating of the outer disk as the most natural explanation of the observed optical flux during outburst , at least when uv - hard spectra are seen .",
    "as noted several times , irradiation should still play a role in maintaining the disk in a hot , high viscosity state by suppressing the disk instability , but it does not appear to dominate the energy budget .    the point is often made that studies such as this one are severely compromised by assumption of local black - body spectra . at some level , of course , this is true , but in the uv , and especially the optical , the effect is likely to be mild .",
    "the two most important effects on a optical - uv broad - band sed , for the temperatures considered , are hydrogen breaks and limb - darkening .",
    "line - blanketing by many blended absorption lines could have some effect , although the highest quality data suggest a rather clean continuum where the effect of intrinsic ( non - interstellar ) absorption lines is very weak or absent , except for ly@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the balmer jump falls well within our spectral coverage .",
    "while this results in strong distortion of the sed of hot stars , such large effects are clearly not present in our data , and there is little if any evidence for its presence at all .",
    "the observations are consistent with spectral models of accretion disks around stellar mass black holes which do predict rather weak balmer jumps ( e.g.  @xcite ; hubeny priv .  comm . )",
    "a much larger effect is predicted at the lyman break , and has the effect of significantly enhancing the far - uv flux longward of the break .",
    "this effect produces an upturn which is principle is detectable .",
    "such an upturn was indeed observed in xte  j1859 + 226  @xcite , and may also be present in gs  1124684 , as shown earlier .",
    "an alternative explanation was advanced by @xcite , however , that this upturn originates from deviation of the far - uv rise component of extinction from the galactic average .",
    "disentangling the two effects is likely impossible without line - of - sight extinction curves or a larger sample of objects .",
    "furthermore , strong lyman breaks can also be predicted in agn spectra , but are not observed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the other deviation from black body spectra that could be significant is limb - darkening @xcite .",
    "this is wavelength dependent and stronger in the uv , so tends to soften the far - uv flux .",
    "it is an inclination dependent effect , however , and for the moderate inclinations of the objects considered here ( 4060@xmath191 ; see section  [ modelsection ] ) should not be dominant . with both balmer and lyman breaks and limb - darkening",
    ", the models of @xcite do not deviate from their black - body counterparts by more than @xmath192 in @xmath193 over the optical - uv range , for inclinations of less than 60@xmath191 .",
    "in particular , a uv - hard spectrum remains uv - hard .",
    "consequently black - body spectra do appear adequate for the analysis presented here , and it is likely that the dominant uncertainty is actually in the reddening corrections , not the local emergent spectra .",
    "the optical and uv spectral energy distributions of bhxrts in outburst have the potential to inform us of the temperature distribution of the outer disk , and hence test models for the heating of these disks .",
    "we have collated all the spectra published to date on short period typical systems which we believe are useful in this regard . in spite of a 25year baseline ,",
    "these data are rather limited . _ hst _  data are by far the most suitable for this work in both the uv and the optical .",
    "ground - based optical studies suffer from uncertainties in the flux calibration , especially at short wavelengths , and from telluric absorption at long wavelengths .",
    "consequently even from the small sample available , only a subset are really reliable .",
    "even with high quality data , further complications arise from uncertainty in the line - of - sight extinction curve .",
    "if the curve is known , then the reddening can be determined to high - precision using the 2175  feature . without _ a priori _ knowledge of the extinction curve , however , the relative strength of the feature is not known and the reddening can not be precisely determined .",
    "further difficulties arise from variations in other aspects of the uv extinction curve .",
    "the far - uv rise seems particularly variable in our sample and several of the sources considered exhibited kinks in the far - uv which could be attributed to an incorrect correction of the far - uv rise .",
    "these further compound the uncertainty in the dereddened spectral energy distributions .    in spite of these difficulties",
    ", we can draw some useful conclusions .",
    "provided a suitable sample of typical short - period bhxrts are selected , the optical spectra form a relatively homogeneous sample .",
    "all have quasi - power - law shapes , with spectral slopes ( in @xmath194 vs.  @xmath195 ) of 0.51.5 .",
    "where the data are good enough to discriminate , the optical spectra tend to soften as the outburst decays , corresponding to the cooling of the outer disk .",
    "the very homogeneity of the optical spectra means that they are of limited value alone in testing disk models , and they can not discriminate between different forms of disk heating .",
    "it is also worth remarking that since the optical lies on the long wavelength tail of the spectral energy distribution the @xmath173 band flux is not necessarily related in a straightforward way to the irradiating luminosity and this may complicate attempts to compare optical and x - ray lightcurves ; for example the optical brightness _ at a fixed mass flow rate _ , and hence the optical to x - ray flux ratio , will depend upon the size of the hot region of the disk .    to perform more useful tests requires uv data .",
    "ideally full optical - uv coverage can be used , but the uv alone has some power to discriminate .",
    "all spectra flatten in the uv , although depending on the source and epoch this effect may be a modest reduction in slope , or a complete turnover ( i.e.  decreasing @xmath194 ) .",
    "uncertainties in dereddening the spectra complicate the interpretation of the uv slope , but in xte  j1859 + 226  evolution was seen from one form to the other , indicating that there are real variations . in this case , the evolution was in the opposite sense to the optical ; the uv spectrum hardened during the outburst decay .",
    "these spectral shapes can be thought of as defining optical - uv spectral states in bhxrts , analogous to x - ray spectral states .",
    "the case where the uv spectrum continues to rise can be termed the uv - hard state , and both a  062000  and gs  1124684exhibit this state .",
    "spectra which peak and fall off in the uv can be termed uv - soft , such as those of gro  j0422 + 32 . in this terminology ,",
    "xte  j1859 + 226  exhibited a transition from the uv - soft to uv - hard state as it decayed .",
    "these spectra can be interpreted in terms of simple black body disk models .",
    "the full range can be accommodated with two forms of heating , one varying as @xmath187 and one as @xmath186 .",
    "the first is readily interpreted as due to irradiation by a compact x - ray source and produces uv - soft spectra . the second is usually associated with viscous heating , but can also arise if the disk is illuminated by a vertically extended x - ray source .",
    "evolution from the first form to the second as the disk cools results in exactly the behavior seen in xte  j1859 + 226   the optical spectrum softens , but the uv hardens .",
    "none of the other sources exhibit such a clear transition , although gro  j0422 + 32  exhibited similar optical spectral evolution to xte  j1859 + 226suggested it might have shown the same effect if suitable late - epoch data were available . a  062000  and gs  1124684  suggest @xmath186 heating , whereas gro  j0422 + 32  can be interpreted as @xmath187 irradiated heating .",
    "it might be significant that both gro  j0422 + 32  and xte  j1859 + 226(at least early in the outburst ) were identified by @xcite as particularly hard sources ; it may be that there is a correlation between the optical - uv state ( i.e.  the form of heating of the outer disk ) and the x - ray state .",
    "evidence for this effect is provided by @xcite who argue that the transition to the low / hard state near the end of the outburst is accompanied by a substantial enhancement in the reprocessing efficiency .",
    "obviously a larger sample is needed to robustly test these issues .",
    "ideally we would like to see more examples of transitions in the optical - uv spectral state .",
    "the interpretation of the uv - hard state remains uncertain .",
    "these spectra are well fitted by a viscously heated shakura - sunyaev disk spectrum . in the case of a  062000",
    "this interpretation is quite sensible  assuming a lobe - filling disk accreting at 30%  of the eddington rate quite naturally produces both the optical fluxes and the spectral shape without invoking reprocessing as the dominant source of optical emission . to explain gs  1124684  in the same way",
    ", however , appears to require super - eddington accretion ( c.f.@xcite ) .",
    "irradiation by an extended x - ray source offers a way out of this difficulty , and could bypass self - shielding of the disk @xcite , but creates its own problems by requiring a very extended x - ray emission ( or scattering ) region .",
    "further progress in this area undoubtedly requires more observations of the quality of those of xte  j1859 + 226 . just as important , however , may be for the observations to make contact meaningfully with simulations of disk outbursts .",
    "progress is being made ( e.g.@xcite ) but simulations have not yet adequately accounted for disk warping , or realistic x - ray irradiation @xcite ; the x - ray emission geometry ( compact vs.extended ) , and spectral changes may have a significant impact on the strength of irradiation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "we can explore different irradiation regimes qualitatively with a simple geometric model of reprocessing , similar to that used by @xcite for active galactic nuclei . consider a disk element at radius @xmath196 , height @xmath197 , and local slope @xmath198 .",
    "the element is illuminated by an isotropically emitting x - ray point source at height @xmath199 above the center of the disk .",
    "the flux @xmath200 incident upon the surface element depends upon both the distance from the x - ray source and the angle of incidence of the x - rays . in general , @xmath201 where the distance of the x - ray source from the element is @xmath202 in cylindrical coordinates , and the normal to the surface is @xmath203 . for a geometrically thin disk ( @xmath204 ) , compact x - ray source ( @xmath205 ) , and shallow disk gradients ( @xmath206 ) , this result simplifies to : @xmath207    the simplest geometry is a flat disk ( @xmath208 ) . in this case , @xmath209 ; this is the simple ` lamppost ' case referred to above .",
    "the same would apply if the disk is not flat , but @xmath210 is constant , since then @xmath211 .",
    "somewhat more realistic cases can be approximated with a power - law disk : @xmath212 , where @xmath213 and @xmath214 refer to values at the outer disk edge . in this case , @xmath215    @xmath216 is the case described above , and separates the behavior into two regimes .",
    "firstly consider a concave disk , @xmath217 . if @xmath218 then the curvature of the disk is negligible and @xmath209 as for a flat disk . if @xmath219 then the vertical elevation of the x - ray source is negligible and we obtain the classical behavior of a concave disk illuminated by a central point source , with @xmath220 in the limiting case of infinitesimal curvature ( i.e.  @xmath221 ) .",
    "the dividing line between the two thus depends upon both the height of the disk relative to the height of the x - ray source and the amount of curvature of the disk . for an extended x - ray source , radius @xmath199",

    "the caveat to this occurs if there is also local scattering material above the disk ( i.e.  the disk atmosphere ) which can scatter irradiation over the disk horizon and illuminate regions that would otherwise be obscured . in this case",
