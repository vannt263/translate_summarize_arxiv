    "here we note that the arguments used in the construction of cb98 and ctpss are rather different .",
    "in particular , cb98 is an empirically parameterized functional ( see the appendix ) , whereas ctpss is constructed based on the satisfaction of known exact conditions . in this work",
    "we have used the parameters determined in ref .   to define the cb98 form .",
    "these parameters were determined at zero field and from post - lda calculations  as a result they may not be optimal for fully self - consistent calculations in the presence of a magnetic field . on the other hand the ctpss functional is designed to satisfy selected constraints at zero field and it could be argued that in the presence of a field both the b98 and tpss based functionals are open to further optimization , though this is beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "the mgga cdft functionals offer a computationally cheap correlated method for the examination of the exotic bonding mechanisms observed in a strong magnetic field . in many areas of chemistry the nature of bonding , chemical reactions , spectra , and properties of molecular species are interpreted qualitatively in terms of orbital interactions .",
    "we now consider the extent to which information from ks - cdft calculations can aid in simple interpretation of the perpendicular paramagnetic bonding interactions .",
    "we begin by considering a molecular orbital analysis of the perpendicular paramagnetic bonding .",

    "we will commence by considering how the molecular orbital energies associated with h@xmath33 and the rare gas dimers change upon application of a magnetic field as the perpendicular paramagnetic bonding in section  [ sec : ksmo ] evolves . since the orbitals themselves can be complex in the presence of a field",
    "we then proceed in section  [ sec : ksrho ] to analyze the bonding in terms of the changes in electronic density of eq .",
    "( [ ksrho ] ) as a function of field , which is naturally a real observable quantity .",
    "ks molecular orbitals have been widely used as an interpretive aid in chemical applications throughout the literature .",
    "the ks orbitals are defined to minimize the non - interacting kinetic energy and yield the physical electronic density via eq .",
    "( [ ksrho ] ) .",
    "they also have appealing properties ; for example the highest occupied mo energy is minus the first ionization potential ( ip )  @xcite and the remaining orbital energies can be interpreted as koopman s type approximations to higher ips  @xcite .",
    "the extent to which these properties hold for general practical approximations has been a subject of debate in the literature  @xcite , as has the interpretation of ks virtual orbitals  @xcite owing to the role of the integer discontinuity  @xcite , which is missing from common approximations .",
    "however , from a practical standpoint it is widely accepted that interpretations based on occupied ks orbitals ( to which we limit the following discussion ) are theoretically justified and their utility has been borne out in many practical applications .",
    "we now consider how the ks orbital energies change upon application of a perpendicular magnetic field of 1 a.u . given that the ctpss based models seem to be the most reliable of those studied in the present work we consider how the orbital energies from this functional change in figures  [ fig : h2mos ] and  [ fig : hemos ] for h@xmath33 and he@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "for the h@xmath33 molecule in the @xmath34 state we consider the energy of the occupied @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals change upon bonding .",
    "in particular , we plot orbital energies in the absence of a field and in a perpendicular field of 1 a.u .",
    "relative to those of the atomic orbitals in the same field .",
    "we have plotted the orbital energies at an internuclear separation @xmath50 a.u .",
    "consistent with the ctpss equilibrium bond length in the presence of a field .",
    "we see that in the absence of a field the singly occupied @xmath48 orbital is stabilized by @xmath51 me@xmath39 , whilst the singly occupied @xmath49 is destabilized by @xmath52 me@xmath39 relative to the 1s hydrogen orbitals .",
    "this is consistent with a net bond order of zero and a repulsive profile for the corresponding potential energy curve . in the perpendicular field of 1 a.u .",
    "we see that , relative to the hydrogen 1s orbital in the same field , the @xmath48 orbital is stabilized by @xmath53 me@xmath39 , whilst the @xmath49 orbital is destabilized by @xmath54 me@xmath39 .",
    "this greater stabilization of the @xmath48 orbital leads to a net bonding interaction , consistent with the analysis of ref .  .",
    "this illustrates that the ks orbitals can be a useful tool in rationalizing this exotic bonding phenomenon .     and @xmath49 cdft molecular orbitals for h@xmath33 relative to the atomic 1s orbitals , with ( blue ) and without ( red ) a field of 1.0 a.u .",

    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the lowest @xmath55 state of he@xmath33 and is presented in figure  [ fig : hemos ] . in this plot",
    "we have separated the spin down and spin up orbitals and defined their energies relative to atomic orbitals of the same spin in the same field . defined in this way the offset between the orbitals of different spin due to the zeeman interaction",
    "is removed from the plot .",
    "again the energies correspond to the ctpss he@xmath33 equilibrium internuclear separation @xmath56 a.u . in the presence of a perpendicular field . in the absence of a field",
    "we see that again the relative stabilization of @xmath48 and destabilization of @xmath49 are approximately compensatory , whilst in the presence of a field the @xmath48 orbital is more stabilized than the @xmath49 orbital is destabilized .",
    "it is also clear that the extra stabilization of the @xmath48 orbital of @xmath57 me@xmath39 is considerably less than the @xmath58 me@xmath39 observed for h@xmath33 .",

    "similar orbital energy diagrams may be constructed for the hene and nene systems , however , they become significantly more complex due to large differences between the orbital energies in hene and the splitting of the p - orbitals in nene .",
    "we therefore consider an alternative visualization of the bonding effects in these systems based on the charge and ( physical ) current density differences .      for each of the species he@xmath33 , hene and ne@xmath33 , we have performed calculations of the electronic density and current density in the presence of varying perpendicular magnetic fields ( @xmath59 ) using the ctpss functional at the corresponding equilibrium geometries .",
    "here we consider the density change @xmath60 for each system relative to the isolated atoms in the same field , @xmath61 this difference density allows for a visualization of the nature of the paramagnetic bonding in these systems . in a similar manner one can consider the ( gauge invariant ) _ physical _ current density difference @xmath62 @xmath63    in figure [ fig : densdiff ] we present plots of the density differences in eqs .",
    "( [ rhodiff ] ) and ( [ jdiff ] ) for each of the species with @xmath64 a.u .",
    "the shading of the contours represents the buildup ( red ) or depletion of the charge density ( blue ) , relative to two non - interacting atoms in the same field . in all three cases",
    "there is a clear build up of density between the atoms consistent with bonding .",
    "the charge density difference is elongated along the field , above and below the plane of the plots .",
    "the streamlines show the vector field associated with the current density difference .",
    "paratropic circulations are clearly visible over the centre of the bonds where charge density accumulates , and diatropic circulations are visible in regions where the charge density is depleted . we have confirmed that for higher fields the alignment between para- / dia - tropic circulations and charge accumulation / depletion becomes more pronounced .        this picture of the perpendicular paramagnetic bonding suggests that as the charge density is elongated along the field the constituent atoms may approach one another more closely . as they do so they experience a greater nuclear - nuclear repulsion , which may be screened by a rearrangement of the charge density towards the bond centre . this rearrangement is accompanied by consistent para- and dia - tropic current circulations .",
    "the ctpss functional used in this work provides a simple , computationally cheap , route to perform analysis of the bonding encountered in the strong field regime .",
    "in this work we have implemented a previously detailed@xcite modification to the kinetic energy density term in mgga functionals to perform non - perturbative cdft calculations in a stable , gauge invariant manner using the london program  @xcite .",
    "the modified mgga functionals cb98 , ctpss and ctpss(h ) show a level of accuracy in predicting weak field magnetic properties that is competitive with existing gga functionals without any additional fitting .",
    "the functionals ctpss and ctpss(h ) show excellent prediction of perpendicular paramagnetic bonding behaviour , suggesting that the modification of the kinetic energy density is a viable route for the incorporation of current effects in standard mgga density - functionals .",
    "in contrast to vorticity dependent forms previously studied  @xcite the functionals exhibited excellent numerical stability in the finite field setting without the need for delicate numerical regularizations .    whilst the mgga results show considerable promise in the high field regime ,",
    "their performance in the weak field regime is perhaps disappointing  leading to only modest improvements of conventional gga forms . to some extent",
    "this may be due to the fact that mggas contain many of the shortcomings associated with gga forms .",
    "for example , the functionals still have potentials with incorrect asymptotic behaviour  particularly for the exchange contribution .",
    "since the current effects at weak field are not dominant but rather add small corrections to the predominantly coulombic exchange and correlation interactions then it may be necessary to further improve the underlying functional forms before the true impact of the current terms can be assessed in this regime .",
    "we expect that this approach to include current dependence should play a central role in the future development of new cdft functionals and many avenues are open for development .",
    "obvious possibilities include the generalization of range - separated mgga functionals  @xcite to obtain a better balance of errors between exchange , correlation and current contributions and the re - parameterization of functionals either empirically or via the consideration of alternative exact conditions in their construction . in the latter category",
    "we note that the presence of a magnetic field causes compression of the electronic density in two dimensions perpendicular to the field and elongation along it . as a result",
    "non - uniform coordinate scaling relations may be one example of conditions that may provide a powerful tool in further development .",
    "the london program  @xcite provides a powerful platform for this work since cdft approaches can be calibrated against accurate _ ab initio _",
    "data for a range of field strengths , where experimental data may be scarce . in the future",
    "we hope that these relatively inexpensive cdft approaches may then be applied to the study of larger systems such as those in refs .  .",
    "we present the key working equations defining the b98 and tpss functionals , indicating how the the modified @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ taugi ] ) enters each functional .",
    "the b98 functional  @xcite has a general construction that is similar to the popular b97 functional form  @xcite , however , instead of using reduced spin - density gradients it makes use of an inhomogeneity parameter @xmath65 @xmath66 where the exchange hole curvature for the uniform electron gas takes the simple form @xmath67 and @xmath68 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
