    "two remarkable features of hot jupiters are their inflated radii and the variety of infrared emission signatures , some of which have been interpreted to reveal stratospheric thermal inversions .",
    "many hot jupiters have larger radii than standard cooling models predict , even with the intense irradiation from the host stars included in the radiative transfer .",

    "thermal inversions , i.e.  regions where the atmospheric temperature rises with height , may also implicate turbulent mixing in hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "transit spectra of several hot jupiters have been interpreted as being thermally inverted @xcite .",
    "these observations appear to confirm the predicion of @xcite that molecular absorbers , mainly tio , in the stratosphere could generate inversion layers .",

    ", we change the cooling and contraction rates of hot jupiters . for modest levels of turbulent diffusion ,",
    "the outward radiative flux is partially offset by the downward flux of mechanical energy .",
    "this reduces the net cooling flux from the convective interior , which self - consistently pushes the radiative convective boundary ( rcb ) to higher pressure .    for sufficiently strong eddy diffusion , the downward flux of energy exceeds the outward radiative flux that a planet of fixed entropy can provide . in this case",

    "the emission is independent of the surface temperature for optically thick atmospheres .",
    "vapor pressure equilibrium determines the temperature at the emission level , thus limiting the cooling radiation that the atmosphere can achieve @xcite .",
    "if the absorbed sunlight exceeds this limiting cooling emission , the surface temperature increases until either the volatile reservoir is depleted or the atmosphere becomes sufficiently transparent to the surface blackbody emission .",
    "the role of limiting cooling flux in the runaway greenhouse is played in our mechanism by the cooling flux of the core .",
    "the role of absorbed sunlight is played by the downward , mechanical flux of energy .",
    "if the latter exceeds the former , the planet heats up by increasing the core entropy until energy balance can be achieved .",

    "the mixing of tio vapor requires @xmath279 at @xmath280 mbar , i.e.  the height of the inversion where tio is needed .",

    "while the terminal speed will increase with particle size , it does not depend on atmospheric density for the relevant viscous ( i.e.  stokes ) drag .",

    "such a study would also have to abandon the fixed flux bottom boundary condition used in most atmospheric models ( including s09 ) .",
    "instead the bottom boundary should be a fixed adiabat , chosen to match the observed radius .",
    "this is subject as usual to assumptions about composition and presence of a core . however allowing the flux to float",
    "is needed for a consistent determination of the rcb .",
    "this is crucial for understanding the coupled relationship between compositional mixing and cooling history .",
    "we have investigated how forced turbulent mixing affects the energetic balance and structure of the stably stratified , radiative layers of hot jupiters .",
    "it is crucial to understand how the radiative layer matches onto the convective interior at the radiative - convective boundary ( rcb ) .",
    "this regulates the rate at which the planet cools and therefore controls the evolution of the planet s radius .",
    "previous work has invoked turbulent eddy diffusion of molecular species ( and dust ) .",
    "this mixing changes the opacity to provide better - fitting model spectra of transiting planets , especially those that appear to have thermal inversions ( s09 ) .",
    "we find that turbulent mixing of this kind does not just redistribute chemical species but also significantly affects energetics",
    ".    forced turbulent mixing in stable , radiative regions drives a downward flux of energy that pushes the rcb deeper in the atmosphere , lowering the planet s cooling rate .",
    "we found an upper limit to the strength of turbulent diffusion , @xmath169 , that can be achieved in steady - state . beyond this limit",
    ", the downward flux of energy will heat the convective interior and inflate the planet .",
    "we did not directly model this entropy growth because our model was steady state and did not include overshoot across the rcb",
    ". the deep , marginally stable layer in our solutions would not strongly inhibit overshoot , so heat burial by this mechanism is a likely outcome .",
    "our solutions indicate that interior heating brings the planet back towards steady state , because higher entropy planets have larger @xmath169 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kzzs ] ) .",
    "our mechanism is thus a  mechanical greenhouse effect \" with the role of sunlight in the traditional greenhouse being played by forced turbulent mixing .",
    "for non - uniform turbulent mixing we find that our constraint on @xmath169 applies near the rcb .",
    "more specifically this constraint applies at a pressure @xmath85 , which lies below the deep isothermal region where the radiative layer is transitioning towards convective instability .",
    "our constraints on turbulence in the upper atmosphere are less stringent .",
    "however , the downward flux of mechanical energy likely can not exceed a small fraction ( probably at the percent level ) of the stellar irradiation if it is supplied by weather - layer winds .",
    "if turbulence is too weak at the bottom of the radiative layer , it will not dredge up heavy molecular species  particularly those that condense onto dust grains  to serve as opacity sources near the observable photosphere .",
    "turbulence also deposits heat in the radiative atmosphere when it decays .",
    "non - turbulent sources of energy dissipation  including non - linear wave breaking and ohmic dissipation  also affect energetic balance .",
    "we find that including energy dissipation reduces @xmath169 , and thus makes it easier to inflate a planet for a given level of forced turbulence .",
    "we find a characteristic scale of @xmath301 ",
    "@xmath302 for typical hot jupiter parameters , even ignoring dissipation .",
    "this is orders of magnitude below values quoted in the literature of @xmath170  @xmath1 for the mixing of chemical species @xcite .",
    "we caution that our quantitative results should be taken as illustrative , due to the approximations detailed in ",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "thus when turbulence is important for the redistribution of opacity sources , it also has significant energetic consequences .",
    "our model represents a step towards more self - consistent modeling of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "@xcite first noted that dissipation in radiative layers can slow planetary contraction by pushing the rcb to higher pressures .",
    "they imagined dissipation concentrated in the upper regions of the atmosphere , sourced by insolation driven winds .",
    "other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have included the @xcite dissipation prescription to model exoplanet radii .",
    "however we are unaware of previous works that include the mechanical flux of energy due to turbulence or waves  our @xmath94 in radiative layers .",
    "incorporating this effect in detailed planetary evolution models would require a more precise treatment than this exploratory study .",
    "notably it would require a global model with a realistic equation of state and opacity , not the power laws considered here .    in this paper",
    "we treat diffusion and dissipation by forced turbulence as free parameters to allow a general analysis .",
    "this approach is justified since we currently lack a detailed understanding of these processes .",
    "thus our model can be used to test how any specific model for turbulence and/or energy dissipation affects the structure and evolution of the planet . for instance , the work of @xcite consider ohmic dissipation in radiative and convective regions , but do not recompute the effect of the dissipation on the structure of the radiative layer .",
    "our point is not to critique , but to emphasize that a more consistent treatment of energetics may make it easier to inflate a planet  by any number of mechanisms .",
    "we also hope to include the effects of our study in detailed 3d radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "this would involve adding sub - grid physical prescriptions for eddy fluxes to global circulation models ( gcm ) such as those by @xcite and/or non - hydrostatic simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite discusses the need to include explicit sources of dissipation .",
    "@xcite present a first step towards sub - grid modeling of turbulence due to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "breaking of vertically propagating gravity waves represent another possible source of turbulence @xcite . when all these effects are taken into account , the inflated radii of transiting planets may not be surprising after all .",
    "we have focused on hot jupiters , but the physics we describe in principle applies to other atmospheres .",
    "our limits on eddy diffusion become less severe as objects are more weakly irradiated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kzzs ] ) .",
    "thus our mechanism would not inflate longer period gas giants , including jupiter and saturn .",
    "more intrinsically luminous objects like brown dwarfs will similarly be less affected .",
    "the expanding inventory of transiting exoplanets , at wider separations , is an excellent test of radius evolution models .",
    "finally we comment on a possible connection to the atmosphere of venus .",
    "venus has a marginally stable pseudo - adiabat beneath a thick cloud deck @xcite .",
    "the clouds shield sunlight from warming the surface of venus . because of this , venus atmosphere would be nearly isothermal were it not for some poorly understood mechanical stirring process .",
    "our well - stirred hot jupiter atmospheres also have marginally stable pseudo - adiabats at depth .",
    "perhaps venus is a very - well - stirred analog of a hot jupiter .",
    "obvious differences exist , for instance the non - negligible fraction of sunlight that reaches the venusian surface versus the radiant flux escaping the core of hot jupiters .",
    "pursuing analogies such as these should improve our understanding of worlds near and far .",

    "we can show that an adiabatic solution is consistent by assuming @xmath45 and then confirming that the final term @xmath309 as @xmath310 .",
    "with @xmath311 we can show that the exponent in the last proportionality of equation([eq : scaletest ] ) is indeed negative .",
    "this is because @xmath312 ( which is generally true , for our opacity @xmath313 ) and because reasonable opacities have @xmath68 and @xmath61 ( see  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "thus a deep adiabat is a consistent solution at large pressure , for constant @xmath2 .",

    "thus the limit on dissipation at the rcb , using equation([eq : fp ] ) and requiring @xmath326 , is @xmath327 since @xmath328 , the maximum depth of the rcb declines with increasing dissipation at the rcb .",
    "this result is very useful in finding @xmath169 values with dissipation . without dissipation",
    "we could easily find @xmath169 by increasing @xmath305 ( eq .  [ [ eq : psi ] ] ) to arbitrarily large values ( which results in fig .",

    "though a bit convoluted , this procedure converges .",
    "finally note that our constraint on dissipation at the rcb does not ensure stability at all @xmath330 .",
    "assume that the inequality in equation([eq : disslim ] ) holds so that there is a radiative layer above the rcb .",
