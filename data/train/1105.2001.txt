    "even more remarkably , we do not detect any break in the sb profile in the vicinity of the tidal radius , which is instead observed @xcite and predicted @xcite as a general feature of extra - tidal components .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that the bright m31 gc b514 , which is the only other case we are aware of presenting an extra - tidal component falling as @xmath93 , also displays an obvious break in the profile near the king tidal radius @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the sb profile of ngc5694 appears perfectly smooth and continuous over all its declining branch , i.e from the core radius out to the last observed point .",
    "finally , the density map shown in fig .  [ map ] does not show any obvious elongation or characteristic s - shape structure that is typical of tidal tails ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also the inner iso - density levels are remarkably round ( ellipticity @xmath94 ; * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting analogy comes to mind with the case of the galactic gc ngc1851 , that @xcite recently found to be surrounded by a low - sb halo extending out to @xmath95  pc from the cluster center .",
    "also in that case no sign of tidal tails was found .",
    "however , at odds with the present case , in ngc1851 the onset of the extra tidal halo is marked by an obvious break in the profile , which , beyond the break , declines as @xmath96 .",
    "it could be interesting , in this context , to estimate expected limiting radius imposed by the galactic tidal field , or jacobi radius ( @xmath97 ) , computed with the formula :    @xmath98    that is formally correct for circular orbits within a logarithmic potential ( see * ? ? ? * for references and discussion ) .",
    "@xmath99 is the cluster mass , derived from the total luminosity by adopting @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the galactocentric distance of the cluster , @xmath102 is the mass of the mw enclosed within @xmath101 , computed as @xmath103 .",

    "hence , at the present orbital phase the galactic tidal field can not have a serious impact on the structure of the cluster , at least in the region of the profile sampled by our data .",
    "the jacobi radius would match @xmath107  pc for a circular orbit at @xmath108  kpc , thus suggesting that the peri - galactic point of the cluster orbit should be at a similar ( or larger ) distance , a quite plausible occurrence , given the large apo - galactic distance estimated by l06 .",
    "mcv interpreted the good overall performance of spherical and isotropic w75 models in fitting the profile of any kind of massive cluster even if extended , as an indication that _",
    "`` self - gravitating clusters commonly have envelope structures that do not match the extrapolations of simple k66 models fitting the cluster cores .",
    "this phenomenon is not confined exclusively to young clusters and is not obviously only transient ; it may point instead to generic , internal cluster physics not captured by king s stellar distribution function''_. this can be the case also for ngc5694 .",
    "an obvious example of physics that are not captured by k66 models is provided by the initial conditions at the cluster birth .",
    "these may leave their imprint even after a hubble time in the outer fringes of the cluster , where the effects of two - body relaxation may bee too slow to completely erase them , and galactic tides possibly have not played a major role .",
    "further theoretical work is clearly needed to fully understand the nature of these features @xcite",
    ".    in this framework ngc5694 appears as especially interesting , since the outer branch of its profile can not be fitted even by w75 models , that are considered by mcv as rather ad - hoc solutions . in any case , the present result , as well as many other recent findings ( * ? ? ?",

    "in conclusion we are unable to draw a firm conclusion about the origin of the newly detected extended component surrounding ngc  5694 .",

    "<S> we report on the discovery of an extended stellar halo surrounding the distant galactic globular cluster ngc  5694 , based on new deep ( @xmath0 ) wide - field ( @xmath1 ) photometry acquired with vimos at vlt . </S>",
    "<S> stars with colour and magnitude consistent with the main sequence of the cluster are clearly identified out to @xmath2  pc ) from the cluster center , much beyond the tidal radius of the king model that best fits the inner profile ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a clear end of the structure within our field . </S>",
    "<S> the overall observed profile can not be properly fitted with either a king ( 1966 ) model , an elson et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1987 ) model , or a wilson ( 1975 ) model ; however it is very smooth and does not show any sign of the break near the tidal radius that is typically observed in stellar systems with tidal tails . </S>",
    "<S> the density map we derived does not show evidence of tidal tails , within the considered field . </S>",
    "<S> the extra - tidal component contains @xmath4% of the cluster light ( mass ) and has a surface density profile falling as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the possible origin of the detected structure is discussed , as a clear - cut conclusion can not be reached with the available data .    </S>",
