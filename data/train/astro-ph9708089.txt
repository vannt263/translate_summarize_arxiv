    "sgr a * may be a massive ( @xmath2 ) point - like object dominating the gravitational potential in the inner @xmath3 pc region of the galaxy .",
    "this inference is based on the large proper motion of nearby stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the spectrum of sgr a * ( @xcite ) , its low proper motion ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) , and its unique location ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gaseous flows in this region are themselves rather complex , and key constituents appear to be the cluster of mass - losing , blue , luminous stars comprising the irs 16 assemblage , which is located within several arc seconds ( @xmath5 0.04 pc in projection at the distance to the galactic center ) from sgr a*. measurements of high outflow velocities associated with ir sources in sgr a west ( @xcite ) and in irs 16 ( @xcite ) , the @xmath6 emission in the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) from molecular gas being shocked by a nuclear mass outflow ( @xcite ) , broad br@xmath7 , br@xmath8 and he i emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and radio continuum observations of irs 7 ( @xcite ) , provide clear evidence of a hypersonic wind , with velocity @xmath9 , a number density @xmath10 , and a total mass loss rate @xmath11 , pervading the inner parsec of the galaxy .",
    "many of sgr a * s radiative characteristics may be due to its accretion of the irs 16 wind .    in the classical bondi - hoyle ( bh ) scenario ( @xcite ) , the mass accretion rate for a uniform hypersonic flow is @xmath12 , in terms of the accretion radius @xmath13 . at the galactic center , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we would therefore expect an accretion rate @xmath16 onto the black hole , with a capture radius @xmath17 . since this accretion rate is sub - eddington for a one million solar mass object , the accreting gas",
    "is mostly unimpeded by the escaping radiation field and is thus essentially in hydrodynamic free - fall starting at @xmath18 .",
    "our initial numerical simulations of this process , assuming a highly simplistic uniform flow past a point mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have verified these expectations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the nature of bondi - hoyle accretion onto a point like object also presents somewhat of a challenge in understanding what happens to the gas as it settles down into a planar configuration close to the event horizon .",
    "fluctuations beyond the bow shock ( located at @xmath19 ) produce a transient accretion of net angular momentum that ought to result in the formation of a temporary ( albeit small ) disk .",
    "the circularization radius is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath22 is the specific angular momentum in units of @xmath23 .",
    "our simulations of the bh accretion from a uniform flow suggest that in this configuration @xmath24 . more realistically , the inflow itself carries angular momentum , so that the formation of a disk - like structure at small radii ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) may be difficult to avoid ( @xcite )",
    ". however , the observations do not appear to favor the presence of a _ standard _ @xmath7-disk at small radii ( @xcite ) .",
    "the current upper limits on the infrared flux from sgr a * ( @xcite ) suggest that either ( 1 ) the circularized flow does not form an @xmath7-disk , but rather advects most of its dissipated energy through the event horizon ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 2 ) the bondi - hoyle flow merges into a massive , fossilized disk , storing most of the deposited matter at large radii ( @xcite ) , or ( 3 ) sgr a * is not a point - like object ( @xcite ) .",
    "added to this is the fact that in reality the flow past sgr a * is not likely to be uniform . for example , one might expect many shocks to form as a result of wind - wind collisions within the irs 16 comples , even before the plasma reaches @xmath18 . with this consequent loss of bulk kinetic energy , it would not be surprising to see the black hole accrete at an even larger rate than in the uniform case .",
    "the implications for the spectral characteristics of sgr a * , and thus its nature , are significant .",
    "we have therefore undertaken the task of simulating the bh accretion from the spherical winds of a distribution of 10 individual point sources located at an average distance of a few @xmath18 from the central object .",
    "as we shall see below , the accretion rate depends not only on the distance of the mass - losing star cluster from the accretor but also on the relative spatial distribution of the sources . as suggested by related work involving linear gradients ( @xcite ) , the average value of @xmath22 is also larger than that of the uniform case , exhibiting large temporal fluctuations , but still not as large as one might expect . in this _ letter _",
    "we present the results of the first 3d hydrodynamical calculations of multiple - source stellar winds accreted by a point mass .",
    "although we here attempt to model the wind source more realistically than in previous work , we shall still focus on the hydrodynamical aspects of the flow and thus we do not include heating or cooling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . nor",
    "do we include any relativistic effects .",
    "instead , we assume the medium to be an unmagnetized , polytropic gas with pressure @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the mass and internal energy densities , respectively , and @xmath29 is the adiabatic index .",
    "this value of @xmath8 was chosen so that the sonic point @xmath30 occurs outside the accretor , which typically is modeled with a radius @xmath31 . some earlier work ( e.g. , @xcite ) found that varying @xmath8 affects the flow pattern significantly , particularly at radii much smaller than @xmath18 , while others ( e.g. , @xcite ) found that it does not , particularly at the larger radii considered here .",
    "we use the numerical algorithm zeus-3d , a general purpose code for mhd fluids developed at ncsa ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out within a cubical domain of solution with @xmath32 active zones geometrically scaled so that the central zones are 1/32 times the size of the outermost zones , closely mimicking the `` multiply nested grids '' arrangement used by other researchers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this allows for maximal resolution of the accretor within the computer memory limits available while sufficiently resolving the wind sources and minimizing zone - to - zone boundary effects .",
    "the total volume is @xmath33 or @xmath34 using a point mass @xmath35 located at the origin and a mach 10 galactic center wind with @xmath36 .",
    "the initial density is set to a small value and the velocity is set to zero .",
    "the internal energy density is chosen such that the temperature is @xmath37 .",
    "free outflow conditions are imposed on the outermost zones and each time step is determined by the courant condition with a courant number of 0.5 .",
    "the 10 identical stellar wind sources are modeled by forcing the velocity in 10 subregions of @xmath38 zones to be constant ( at @xmath39 ) while the densities in these subvolumes are set so that the total mass flow into the volume of solution , @xmath40 , is 3@xmath41 .",
    "recent observations ( @xcite ) suggest that the irs 16 wind is somewhat colder than the temperature assumed here , with a mach number of @xmath42 30 , and that it may originate from more than 15 sources of varying strength rather than 10 sources of equal strength . this level of detail will be addressed in future work .",
    "to gauge the dependence of our results on the source configuration , we here simulate the bh process using two different stellar distributions . for numerical reasons ,",
    "the sources need to be placed a minimum of 8 zones ( @xmath43 ) apart so no attempt is made here to imitate exactly the distribution within the irs 16 cluster .",
    "the _ average _ location for the sources in run 1 is @xmath44 ( with the accretor located at the origin ) and @xmath45 for run 2 . for run 1 ,",
    "the sources are distributed fairly randomly with x , y , and z being allowed to vary by @xmath46 of the average location . for run 2 , x and y",
    "are allowed to be as much as 5 @xmath18 from the average location while z can only vary by @xmath47 .",
    "these distributions are chosen to represent the extremes of a spherical stellar distribution versus a more or less planar one .",
    "for comparison , irs 16 nw and irs 16 ne , two bright members of the irs 16 cluster , are @xmath48 and @xmath49 away ( in projection ) from sgr a * ( @xcite ) .",
    "each simulation is evolved for 2000 years .",
    "the wind crossing time is @xmath42 400 years and equilibrium , the point at which the original gas is swept out of the volume of solution and the mass accretion rate stabilizes , appears to be reached within 2 crossing times , or @xmath42 800 years .",
    "figure 1 shows a logarithmic negative grey scale image of the density profile for a slice running through the center of the accretor , for run 1 taken 2000 years after the winds are `` turned on '' .",
    "the image is 6 @xmath18 on a side with the @xmath50 radius accretor located at the center .",
    "one stellar source can be clearly seen to the upper right of the accretor ; the other 9 sources are either not in the plane of the slice or are off to the right .",
    "the image spans 4 magnitudes of density with white being @xmath51 and black being @xmath52 .",
    "figure 2 is a similar image for run 2 .",
    "note the large density fluctuations across the overall region .",
    "also , the flow pattern is clearly different for the two configurations .",
    "however , once the stellar winds have cleared the region of the original low density gas , both simulations point to an overall average density ( @xmath53 ) in agreement with observations .    a substantial difference between these point source simulations and previous uniform calculations",
    "is that although there are transient fragmentary shocks extending from the accretor boundary ( see figure 1 ) , there is no large - scale bow shock structure .",
    "there are , however , bow shocks around some of the stellar sources as their wind impacts the stronger accumulated wind of the other sources ( see the source in figure 1 ) , and , for run 2 , a semi - stable partial bow shock appears in front of the accretor ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the wind - wind collisions convert kinetic energy into thermal energy with the result that a larger fraction of the gas is captured by the central engine .",
    "although this effect is likely to be sensitive to the actual stellar distribution , a larger density of point sources should produce more wind - wind collisions and perhaps further raise the accretion rate .",
    "for a wind originating from a single point source located at a distance @xmath54 ( @xmath18 ) from the accretor , @xmath55 is less than @xmath56 due to the divergent flow . specifically , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "however , wind - wind collisions from multiple sources reduce the effective @xmath39 , thereby increasing the effective @xmath18 so that all of the shocked gas will then accrete and more than compensate for the geometric losses . in figure 3",
    "we present the mass accretion rate , @xmath55 , and the accreted specific angular momentum , @xmath22 , versus time for run 1 , starting 2 crossing times ( @xmath42 800 years ) after the winds are `` turned on '' .",
    "figure 4 presents the results for run 2 .",
    "the average values for the mass accretion rate once the systems have reached equilibrium are @xmath59 for run 1 and @xmath60 for run 2 .",
    "the mass accretion rate shows high frequency temporal fluctuations ( with a period of @xmath61 ) due to the finite numerical resolution of the simulations .",
    "the low frequency aperiodic variations ( on the order of @xmath62 in amplitude ) reflect the time dependent nature of the flow .",
    "thus , the mass accretion rate onto the central object , and consequently the emission arising from within the accretor boundary , is expected to vary by @xmath63 ( since in some models @xmath64 may vary by as much as @xmath65 ) over the corresponding time scale of @xmath66 years , even though the mass flux from the stellar sources remains constant .    similarly , for run 1 , the accreted @xmath22 can vary by @xmath67 over @xmath68 200 years with an average equilibrium value of @xmath69 . for run 2 ,",
    "@xmath70 with smaller amplitude long term variability .",
    "since previous uniform simulations resulted in @xmath71 , it appears that even with a large amount of angular momentum present in the wind , relatively little specific angular momentum is accreted .",
    "this is understandable since clumps of gas with a high specific angular momentum do not penetrate within 1 @xmath18 .",
    "the variability in the sign of the components of @xmath22 suggests that if an accretion disk forms at all , it dissolves , and reforms ( perhaps ) with an opposite sense of spin on a time scale of @xmath72 years .",
    "a variety of accretion scenarios for sgr a * have been proposed over the years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , each with its own restrictions on @xmath55 and @xmath22 . while the accreted specific angular momentum determined in the present simulations",
    "is an order of magnitude too small to support the fossil disk scenario ( since then the energy liberated as the wind impacts the fossil disk should be visible ; @xcite ) , it is still large enough that any standard @xmath7-disk would be easily detectable ( @xcite ) . the advection dominated disk scenario ( @xcite ) , while permitting a large range of values for @xmath22 , requires an accretion rate of @xmath73 or roughly @xmath74 , which is 10 - 20 times smaller than the value derived here . in addition , our @xmath55 is more than @xmath75 times larger than that permitted by the `` mono - energetic '' electron model of sgr a * ( @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that additional work is needed to reconcile disk models with the fact that the observed multiple wind sources result in a large mass accretion rate onto the central engine , if its mass is @xmath76 . in view of this",
    ", it may not be unreasonable to conjecture that in fact no flattened disk actually forms in sgr a * , but rather that the excess angular momentum is dissipated in a quasi - spherical configuration and that the thermalized energy is then advected inwards through the event horizon before the gas settles onto a plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations suggest that the @xmath77 region of the galaxy , centered on the wind sources , is swept clear of gas , leaving a hot , low density gas filling the central cavity .",
    "this is consistent with observations of the region within the cnd ( @xcite ) , and may be acting in concert with other mechanisms to produce the sharp inner edge of the cnd ( e.g. , the abrupt change in gravitational potential ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , a tongue of hot , dense gas has been observed that connects members of the irs 16 cluster to sgr a * ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the images in figures 1 and 2 show ridges of dense gas connecting the sources in the figures to the accretor .",
    "this work was partially supported by nasa under grants nagw-2518 and ngt-51637 , and utilized the origin 2000 computer system in friendly user mode at the national center for super computing applications , university of illinois at urbana - champaign .",
