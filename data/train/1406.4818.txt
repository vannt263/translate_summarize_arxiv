    "noise - induced firing patterns of subthreshold neurons in the peripheral and central nervous systems have been studied in many physiological and pathophysiological aspects @xcite . for example , for encoding environmental electric or thermal stimuli ,",
    "sensory receptor neurons were found to use the noise - induced firings , which are generated via the `` constructive '' interplay of subthreshold oscillations and noise @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the suprathreshold case where deterministic firings occur , a distinct characteristic of the noise - induced firings is occurrence of `` skipping '' of spikes at random integer multiples of a basic oscillation period ( i.e. , occurrence of stochastic phase locking ) @xcite .",
    "this random skipping leads to a multi - modal interspike interval histogram .",
    "these noise - induced firings of a single subthreshold neuron become most coherent at an optimal noise intensity , which is called coherence resonance ( or autonomous stochastic resonance without periodic forcing ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , array - enhanced coherence resonance was found to occur via noise - induced synchronization in a population of subthreshold spiking neurons @xcite . here , we are interested in synchronization of noise - induced firings in an ensemble of subthreshold bursting neurons .",
    "bursting occurs when neuronal activity alternates , on a slow timescale , between a silent phase and an active ( bursting ) phase of fast repetitive spikings @xcite .",
    "hence , bursting neurons exhibit two different patterns of synchronization due to the slow and fast timescales of bursting activity .",
    "burst synchronization ( synchrony on the slow bursting timescale ) refers to a temporal coherence between the active phase onset or offset times of bursting neurons , while spike synchronization ( synchrony on the fast spike timescale ) characterizes a temporal coherence between intraburst spikes fired by bursting neurons in their respective active phases @xcite .",
    "recently , the burst and spike synchronizations have been studied in many aspects @xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies were focused on the suprathreshold case where bursting neurons fire deterministic firings , in contrast to subthreshold case of our concern .    in this paper , we study the effect of network architecture on noise - induced burst and spike synchronizations of subthreshold bursting hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) neurons . the conventional erds - renyi random graph has been often used for modeling complex connectivity occurring in diverse fields such as social , biological , and technological networks @xcite .",
    "hence , we first consider a random graph of subthreshold bursting hr neurons , and investigate occurrence of the noise - induced population synchronization by varying the synaptic inhibition strength @xmath1 and the noise intensity @xmath2 .",
    "thus , noise - induced burst and spike synchronizations are found to appear in a synchronous region of the @xmath0 plane .",
    "for the random networks , global efficiency of information transfer becomes high because the average path length ( i.e. , typical separation between two neurons along the minimal path ) is short due to long - range connections @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , random networks have poor clustering ( i.e. , low cliquishness of a typical neighborhood ) @xcite .",
    "however , in a real neural network , synaptic connections are known to have complex topology which is neither regular nor random @xcite .",
    "hence , we consider the watts - strogatz small - world network of subthreshold bursting hr neurons which interpolates between regular lattice ( with high clustering ) and random network ( with short path length ) via rewiring @xcite . the watts - strogatz model can be regarded as a cluster - friendly extension of the random network by reconciling the six degrees of separation ( small - worldness ) @xcite with the circle of friends ( clustering ) . these small - world networks ( with predominantly local connections and rare long - distance connections )",
    "have been employed in many recent works on various subjects of neurodynamics @xcite . by varying the rewiring probability @xmath3 [ @xmath10 ( 0 ) corresponds to a random network ( regular lattice ) ]",
    ", we investigate the effect of small - world connectivity on emergence of noise - induced burst and spike synchronizations .",
    "as @xmath3 is decreased from 1 , the region of fast spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the @xmath0 plane , while the region of the slow burst synchronization decreases slowly .",
    "hence , complete synchronization ( including both the burst and spike synchronizations ) may occur only for sufficiently large @xmath3 where global effective communication ( between distant neurons ) for fast spike synchronization may be available via short synaptic paths . on the other hand , for small @xmath3 only the slow burst synchronization ( without spike synchronization )",
    "occurs .",
    "these noise - induced burst and spike synchronizations may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in experiments",
    ". instantaneous population firing rate ( ipfr ) , @xmath4 , which is directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes , is a realistic collective quantity describing population behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales . through frequency filtering ,",
    "we separate @xmath4 into @xmath5 ( the instantaneous population burst rate ( ipbr ) describing the slow bursting behavior ) and @xmath6 ( the instantaneous population spike rate ( ipsr ) describing the fast intraburst spiking behavior ) . the time - averaged fluctuations of @xmath11 and @xmath9 play the role of bursting and spiking order parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , used for characterizing the burst and spike synchronization transitions , respectively @xcite .",
    "by varying @xmath2 , we investigate the noise - induced bursting transition in terms of @xmath12 for a given @xmath1 , and find that , with increasing the rewiring probability @xmath3 from 0 ( regular lattice ) long - range connections begin to appear , and hence the burst - synchronized range of @xmath2 increases gradually . for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we also study the noise - induced spiking transition in terms of @xmath13 by changing @xmath3 .",
    "when passing a critical value @xmath14 , a transition to spike synchronization is found to occur in small - world networks , because sufficient number of long - range connections for occurrence of fast spike synchronization appear .",
    "we also consider another raster plot of active phase ( bursting ) onset or offset times for more direct visualization of bursting behavior . from this type of raster plot",

    "then , the time - averaged fluctuations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 also play the role of another bursting order parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for the bursting transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , the degree of noise - induced burst synchronization seen in the raster plot of bursting onset or offset times is measured in terms of a statistical - mechanical bursting measure @xmath7 , which was introduced by considering the occupation and the pacing patterns of bursting onset or offset times in the raster plot @xcite . in a similar way",

    "<S> for modeling complex synaptic connectivity , we consider the watts - strogatz small - world network which interpolates between regular lattice and random network via rewiring , and investigate the effect of small - world connectivity on emergence of noise - induced population synchronization in an inhibitory population of subthreshold bursting hindmarsh - rose neurons ( which can not exhibit spontaneous deterministic firings ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , noise - induced burst synchronization ( synchrony on the slow bursting timescale ) and spike synchronization ( synchrony on the fast spike timescale ) are found to appear in a synchronized region of the @xmath0 plane ( @xmath1 : synaptic inhibition strength and @xmath2 : noise intensity ) . as the rewiring probability @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is decreased from 1 ( random network ) to 0 ( regular lattice ) , the region of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the @xmath0 plane , while the region of the burst synchronization decreases slowly . </S>",
    "<S> population synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in experiments . instantaneous population firing rate , @xmath4 , which is directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes , is a realistic population quantity exhibiting collective behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales . through frequency filtering , we separate @xmath4 into @xmath5 ( the instantaneous population burst rate describing the slow bursting behavior ) and @xmath6 ( the instantaneous population spike rate describing the fast intraburst spiking behavior ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , we characterize the burst and spike synchronization transitions in terms of the bursting and spiking order parameters , based on @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . furthermore , the degree of burst synchronization seen in another raster plot of bursting onset or offset times is well measured in terms of a statistical - mechanical bursting measure @xmath7 , introduced by considering the occupation and the pacing patterns of bursting onset or offset times . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we also measure the degree of the intraburst spike synchronization in terms of a statistical - mechanical spiking measure @xmath8 , based on @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> with increase in @xmath3 , both the degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations are found to increase because more long - range connections appear . </S>",
    "<S> however , they become saturated for some maximal values of @xmath3 because long - range short - cuts which appear up to the maximal values of @xmath3 play sufficient role to get maximal degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations . </S>"
