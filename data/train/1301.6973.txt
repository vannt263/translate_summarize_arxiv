    "last years have witnessed a notorious progress in the knowledge of the two - pion system , both from theoretical and experimental sides . in particular , the high precision measurements of the charged and neutral pion vector form factors performed at the flavour factories babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite , cmd-2  @xcite , kloe  @xcite and snd  @xcite",
    "have significantly improved the accuracy of previous data .",
    "as it is well known , theoretical predictions for these form factors can not be obtained analytically from first principles through standard calculations , since this involves in general the hadronization of qcd currents in a nonperturbative energy regime ( @xmath12 gev ) . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", one can rely on effective models  @xcite that intend to describe the involved dynamics within a simplified scheme .",
    "in general , in these models the form factors are required to satisfy the proper behaviour at very low energies , and the effect of intermediate resonances is taken into account through the inclusion of breit - wigner functions . in this way",
    "one can obtain phenomenologically adequate hadronic matrix elements  @xcite , which have been included e.g.  in the standard monte carlo generator for tau decays , tauola  @xcite .",
    "however , in general these models include several ad - hoc assumptions , and can even have problems of consistency with qcd  @xcite .",
    "in addition , even when the agreement with experimental data can be very good , usually the model parameters can be hardly related to the underlying strong interaction theory .",
    "another possible approach is to consider just the symmetry properties of qcd in order to build a general effective action adequate for the desired energy regime . at very low energies @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the @xmath4 resonance mass , the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd allows to build the effective quantum field theory known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath15pt )  @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a successful description of the low - energy phenomenology of strong and electroweak interactions , in which hadronic observables are calculated through an expansion in powers of ratios of momenta and masses of the lightest degrees of freedom ( light pseudoscalar mesons ) over a chiral symmetry breaking scale , @xmath16 gev .",
    "however , for @xmath17 the expansion parameters become large , and new degrees of freedom , namely the lowest - lying light - flavoured resonances , become active .",
    "even though in this regime there is no straightforward expansion parameter , one can build an effective theory by considering an expansion in powers of the inverse of the number of colours , @xmath18 , with the introduction of resonances as active fields in the effective action .",
    "indeed , it is found that this approach allows to describe satisfactorily most salient features of meson phenomenology  @xcite , which suggests that the large-@xmath19 limit of qcd is a good starting point to derive a chiral lagrangian that includes resonance fields @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study one of the simplest hadronic observables , namely the pion vector form factor @xmath20 , defined through @xmath21 where @xmath22 . for @xmath23 , this form factor",
    "is probed by the decay @xmath0 , while in the isospin symmetry limit it can be experimentally measured from @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and elastic @xmath26 scattering ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the analysis of @xmath20 allows to increase our knowledge of the hadronization of qcd currents in the intermediate energy region , where the presence of meson resonances plays a crucial role . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of isospin breaking corrections to the form factors in tau decays and @xmath28 scattering  @xcite is essential for the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath29 , which provides a stringent test of new physics  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the pion vector form factor has been addressed by several authors in the last years . at very low energies ,",
    "@xmath20 has been computed in @xmath15pt up to @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "then , to enlarge the domain of applicability up to @xmath31 gev , unitarization techniques  @xcite and dispersion relations have been employed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to go beyond this energy region , the inclusion of the @xmath32 resonance  @xcite and even a tower of resonances , inspired in the @xmath33 limit  @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "our work is a sort of extension of those in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors analyze @xmath1 and @xmath34 vector form factors considering @xmath35 expressions obtained from a chiral effective theory that includes the dominant resonance exchange , followed by an omns - like resummation of final state interactions .",
    "our procedure is similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath34 vector form factor : we consider an @xmath36-subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath20 in which the input elastic phase shift @xmath37 is taken from the effective theory , resumming the chiral loops into the denominator of the @xmath35 form factor .",
    "this ensures to fulfill unitarity and analyticity constraints .",
    "it is seen that a phenomenologically good result is obtained with three subtractions , hence our expression for @xmath20 depends on four parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath38 , and two subtraction constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( the remaining subtraction constant is fixed by the normalization of the form factor ) .",
    "these constants can be related to chiral low - energy observables  @xcite , namely the squared charged pion radius @xmath41 and the coefficients of @xmath42 and @xmath43 terms in the chiral expansion , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the above described approach is able to provide a good description of the @xmath0 spectral function for a squared @xmath1 invariant mass up to about @xmath46  gev@xmath3 .",
    "beyond these energies , we propose a complementary expression for the form factor that includes the effects of the excited states @xmath47 and @xmath48 , matching smoothly the previous one at @xmath49 .",
    "our result for the full form factor can be useful to improve the new version of tauola @xcite , which presently includes the expressions obtained within a chiral lagrangian framework with resonances @xcite .",
    "this is important @xcite not only for the proper simulation of backgrounds and subsequent signal extraction at the more frequent tau decay modes but also for the analysis of rare processes and the searches of new physics @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ vff low e ] we obtain a dispersive representation of @xmath20 and discuss the inclusion of isospin breaking corrections .",
    "the model parameters are fitted to experimental data up to @xmath50 gev@xmath3 , and our input for @xmath37 in the elastic region is confronted with present experimental values .",
    "then , in section [ vff int e ] we extend our parametrization of @xmath20 to higher energies , including the effective contribution of excited resonances .",
    "the agreement with experimental data is shown . in section [ low - e obs ]",
    "we present the results for the low - energy observables related to our subtraction constants .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] we state the conclusions of our analysis .",
    "as stated , at very low energies the pion vector form factor is well described by @xmath15pt .",
    "let us first consider the limit of exact isospin symmetry . at @xmath35 ,",
    "one has  @xcite @xmath51\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is one of the renormalized low - energy coupling constants in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the functions @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 where the phase space function @xmath55 reads @xmath56 on the other hand , the computation of @xmath20 from a chiral lagrangian that includes the lowest - lying vector meson multiplet as active resonance fields yields  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 measure the strength of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 couplings , respectively , @xmath63 being the quark vector current .",
    "this tree level result corresponds to the leading term in powers of @xmath18 , and it is @xmath35 in the chiral expansion .",
    "if the form factor is required to vanish in the limit of large @xmath5 , then one gets the relation @xmath64 , which yields @xmath65 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ vff chpt ] ) , the low energy @xmath15pt coupling @xmath66 is predicted to be @xmath67 in very good agreement with the value obtained from phenomenology .",
    "this shows explicitly that the @xmath4 contribution is the dominant physical effect in the vector form factor of the pion .",
    "now , as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can do better and match eq .",
    "( [ vmd ] ) to the @xmath35 @xmath15pt result in eq .",
    "( [ vff chpt ] ) , including the final state interactions encoded in the chiral loop functions @xmath53 : @xmath68\\ .",

    "the results do not depend significantly on changes in this scale .",
    "from eq .",

    "one could avoid the double counting by shifting the imaginary part of the loop functions from the exponential to the propagator  @xcite , but still analyticity would be lost .",
    "we follow instead a procedure similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath34 form factor , in which unitarity and analyticity are preserved . as a starting point",
    "we consider a form factor in which the loop functions are resummed into the denominator , @xmath75-s}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{m_\\rho^2}{m_\\rho^2 \\left[1+\\frac{s}{96\\pi^2 f_\\pi^2}\\re e \\left(a_\\pi(s ) + \\frac12 a_k(s)\\right)\\right]-s - i m_\\rho \\gamma_\\rho(s)}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the imaginary part of the denominator as @xmath76 .",

    "( [ a_p ] ) one has @xmath78\\   , \\label{gammarho}\\ ] ] which is in agreement with the result obtained from a chiral theory with resonances  @xcite if one assumes the relation @xmath79 .    the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ su2formula ] ) has the correct low - energy behaviour at @xmath80 @xcite and leading @xmath81 contributions in @xmath15pt @xcite , and vanishes at short distances as expected from the asymptotic behaviour ruled by qcd .",
    "as stated , the loop functions @xmath82 contain the logarithmic corrections induced by final state interactions .",
    "now we take into account the fact that the two pion vector form factor is an analytic function in the complex plane , except for a cut along the positive real axis starting at the threshold for two pion production , @xmath83 , where its imaginary part develops a discontinuity . from unitarity",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the form factor satisfies an @xmath36-subtracted dispersion relation that involves the scattering phase in the elastic region , for which experimental data are available . in the case of @xmath36 subtractions at @xmath84 ,",
    "the dispersion relation admits the well - known omns solution @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the corresponding subtraction polynomial , and @xmath37 is the @xmath87 , @xmath88 two - pseudoscalar scattering phase shift .",
    "the subtraction constants @xmath89 are given by @xmath90 at least one subtraction is required in eq .",
    "( [ omel ] ) to achieve convergence . here",
    "the first subtraction constant has been fixed from the normalization @xmath91 , which holds with good approximation in view of the conservation of the vector current in the isospin symmetry limit . on the other hand , in order to determine the scattering phase shift @xmath37 [ to be used as input in eq .",
    "( [ omel ] ) ] we follow the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking @xmath92 where @xmath93 is given by eq .",
    "( [ su2formula ] ) . in this way ,",
    "the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ su2formula ] ) trivially satisfies the omns relation ( [ omel ] ) for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this form factor should be adequate to reproduce the experimental observations in the low energy limit , since by construction it matches @xmath15pt results .",
    "however , beyond this limit one would not expect a sufficiently accurate description of the data .",
    "fortunately , the analyticity properties of @xmath20 allow to increase accuracy by considering more subtractions in eq .",
    "( [ omel ] ) : for higher @xmath36 , the weight of the dispersive integral at large energies gets reduced , and the corresponding information is translated to the subtraction constants  @xcite , which can be taken as unknown parameters .",
    "in addition , some approach has to be used to deal with the phase shift beyond the inelastic two - kaon threshold , where the contribution of the dispersive integral is in general still relevant and eq .",
    "( [ omel ] ) is no longer valid ( in fact , this happens already at the four - pion threshold , but higher multiplicity intermediate states are expected to be phase space suppressed ) .",
    "the goal is to obtain a form factor that leads to a satisfactory description of the available data , considering just a few subtractions and a phenomenologically adequate elastic phase shift .",
    "on the basis of the previous discussion , we have carried out fits of @xmath20 to belle data from @xmath96 decays .",
    "we find that a good description of the data can be obtained with @xmath97 subtractions , i.e.  taking @xmath98 \\ .\\ ] ] in this form factor we have four parameters , namely the subtraction constants @xmath99 , and the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath38 that determine the phase shift @xmath100 according to eqs .",
    "( [ su2formula ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "in addition , in order to deal with the phase shift in the large energy region , we have distinguished two intermediate ( squared ) energies @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the former is defined as the limit up to which we consider eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) to be a reliable description of the phase shift .",
    "as stated , we expect this value to be of the order of the inelastic two - kaon threshold , @xmath103 , or alternatively we can consider the limit @xmath104 , where the effect of the @xmath105 resonance should dominate . in any case one",
    "expects @xmath101 to be about 1 gev@xmath3 .",
    "as we show below , this will be supported _ a posteriori _ by the good agreement between our predictions and the experimental data for @xmath100 quoted some time ago in refs .",
    "beyond @xmath101 , the dispersive integral in eq .",
    "( [ fv_3_subtractions ] ) should be affected not only by inelastic contributions but also by the presence of excited resonance states .",

    "the corresponding effects on our results have been taken as part of the systematic error of our theoretical approach .",
    "another aspect to be taken into account is the effect of isospin violating corrections to the pion vector form factor . in general",
    "one has to distinguish between the neutral and charged pion vector form factors , the latter being defined by eq .",
    "( [ ff definition ] ) .",
    "the corrections can be expanded in powers of the quark mass difference and the electromagnetic coupling , in addition to the chiral counting .",
    "at the leading order , the spectral function for the decay @xmath0 can be written as  @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 includes the dominant short - distance electroweak corrections , and the factor @xmath114 arises from the contribution of electromagnetic loops . in the isospin limit",
    "one has @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) reduces to the pion vector form factor , @xmath117 .",
    "the dominant isospin breaking effect in @xmath20 is that arising from phase space , i.e. , from considering different masses for the charged and neutral pions and kaons in the loop functions .",

    "our results for @xmath144 and @xmath145 would lead then to the ratio @xmath146 , far from the phenomenological value @xmath147  @xcite .",
