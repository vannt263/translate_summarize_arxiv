    "the aim of this paper is to show that , even if one makes several crude approximations , the theory still keeps the strength to describe _ quantitatively _ some weakly chaotic many - particle systems .",

    "the overall agreement at high temperatures , we must point out a non - resolved source of annoyance . at a fixed energy the kubo parameter scales with the system size like @xmath189 .",
    "consequently the relative error of the theoretical prediction should decrease with increasing @xmath70 , like @xmath84 .",
    "however , e.g. , if we take @xmath190 , and compare theory versus @xmath176 , we see that the relative error is about 11% , insensitive to variations of @xmath70 from 100 to 2500 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we exhibit in figs .",
    "( [ fig : amusi ] ) and ( [ fig : acorr ] ) the comparison of canonical and dynamical averages for @xmath49 , @xmath39 , and @xmath46 : no significant differences can be seen .",
    "( again , the tails of the correlation functions may deserve a deeper analysis . )",
    "figure  ( [ fig : ateovsnum ] ) also displays the predictions of the geometric method @xcite . in the high - temperature regime ,",
    "the relative error of the geometric prediction is somewhat larger than ours . at low temperatures ,",
    "the geometric method predicts a qualitatively correct behavior , @xmath191 , but with the wrong scaling law : @xmath192 @xcite instead of @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we proposed a theoretical approach to the determination of the largest lyapunov exponent of many - particle hamiltonian systems . despite several crude approximations that had to be made , it was not completely clear whether the resulting perturbative / mean - field script could be carried out for a specific system , one of the obstacles being the analytical determination of the correlation functions",
    ".    now we have verified that the stochastic recipe can indeed be executed and works satisfactorily in the quasi - ballistic regimes of the mean - field xy - hamiltonians .",
    "these systems are especially useful for testing the theory because they make the  mean - field \" diagonalization exact . however , three additional sources of error have to be considered .",
    "first of all , we made the simplification of taking the logarithm out of the average [ eq .",
    "( [ defliapunov2 ] ) ] . that is , using a spin - glass analogy , we are estimating an  annealed \" lyapunov exponent @xmath176 instead of the usual  quenched \" @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "quenched averages can be calculated , as shown by tnase - nicola and kurchan @xcite , but they require more sophisticated tools , like the replica trick or the supersymmetric approach . in the cases considered in this paper we verified that the difference between both lyapunov exponents is very small .",
    "then it was not necessary to go beyond the annealed averaging .",
    "the second approximation , and most important one , is the truncation of the cumulant expansion at the second order . by doing so",
    ", we introduce a relative error of the order of the kubo number @xmath38 .",
    "this explains the failure of the theory in the low - temperature regime of the antiferromagnetic xy - hamiltonian , given that the amplitude of the fluctuations @xmath39 remains bounded but the thermal time @xmath41 diverges .",
    "it is not clear at present if the theory can be improved to account for this regime .",
    "further studies are necessary .",
    "in particular we have to understand what kind of dynamical correlations develop as the system approaches the ground state . another problem that requires an answer :",
    "we have not observed that the agreement between theory and simulations betters when the size of the system is increased , for fixed energy .",
    "this is in contradiction with the kubo number decreasing like @xmath84 .",
    "the difficulties of the preceding paragraph may be related to the third approximation , which concerns the interaction representation we have used . in order to isolate the fluctuations",
    ", one should work in the representation associated to the average hessian .",
    "instead , we have chosen the free - rotator representation .",
    "that is , in constructing the  free propagator \" , we neglected the average hessian of the interaction potential .",
    "as long as the motion is quasi - ballistic , this approximation seems justified .",
    "it will be certainly wrong , e.g. , in the low - temperature phase of the ferromagnetic xy , where the quadratic part of the interaction is really important .",
    "we are currently working on the implementation of the best interaction representation for the infinite - range xy models .",
    "the results will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the mean - field diagonalization is exact for the systems considered here . in other cases it represents just a truncation of the basis for diagonalizing @xmath193 [ eq .  ( [ expansion ] ) ] .",
    "notice , however , that we are dealing with a hermitian problem , i.e. , finding the largest eigenvalue of @xmath194 [ eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) ] .",
    "truncation of the basis will produce a lower bound to the largest lyapunov exponent ( provided that @xmath193 is calculated accurately ) .",
    "so , this problem is analogous to finding the ground - state energy of a quantum hamiltonian .",
    "any small subspace can be considered , the choice being guided by the special characteristics of the system under study .    like its quantum analogue",
    ", the lyapunov problem seems reluctant to admit simple general solutions .",
    "each class of systems may require special consideration .",
