    "<S> magnetic and spin - based technologies for data storage and processing pose unique challenges for information transduction to light because of magnetic metals optical loss , and the inefficiency and resistivity of semiconductor spin - based emitters at room temperature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transduction between magnetic and optical information in typical organic semiconductors poses additional challenges as the faraday and kerr magnetooptical effects rely on the electronic spin - orbit interaction@xcite , and the spin - orbit interaction in organics is weak@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . other methods of coupling light and spin have emerged in organics , however , as the spin - dependent character of exciton recombination , with spin injection from magnetic electrodes , provides magnetization - sensitive light emission@xcite , although such approaches have been limited to low temperature and low polarization efficiency@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate room temperature information transduction between a magnet and an organic light emitting diode that does not require electrical current , based on control via the magnet s remanent field of the exciton recombination process in the organic semiconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> organic semiconductor devices have become a ubiquitous lighting technology due to their flexibility , inexpensive character , and highly efficient light output . </S>",
    "<S> organic information processing also has an important niche where computational speed is less important than flexibility or expense . </S>",
    "<S> nonvolatile information storage in organic electronics poses a challenge , as organic semiconductor flash memory currently have high leakage currents due to the large electric fields required to change transport properties in organic semiconductors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - volatility , speed , and low energy consumption of magnetic memory make it fundamentally attractive for integration with organics although magnetic metals have large impedence mismatches with organics . </S>",
    "<S> this can be overcome using coupling through a magnet s fringe field at zero applied field ( remanent field ) as demonstrated in organic electronic devices@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> efficient coupling via the magnet s remanent field between light emission in organic devices and a magnetic memory would broaden the range of applicability of flexible , inexpensive organic electronics . </S>",
    "<S> our demonstration of efficient room - temperature coupling between an organic light - emitting diode and a few - nanometer - thick magnetic film can be explained quantitatively within a theory of spin - dependent exciton recombination in the organic semiconductor , influenced only by the remanent fringe fields of the magnetic material .    </S>",
    "<S> organic semiconductor sandwich devices , used for example in organic light - emitting diodes ( oleds ) , consist of a thin film of an organic semiconductor ( or several layers thereof ) sandwiched between a bottom and top electrode . </S>",
    "<S> the organic semiconductor is typically intrinsic , and is essentially void of charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one of the electrodes is chosen to efficiently inject electrons , and the other to efficiently inject holes . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose low and high - work function metals , respectively , are chosen . </S>",
    "<S> recombination of electron - hole pairs leads to electroluminescence , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]a . </S>",
    "<S> transport of the injected carriers through the organic film occurs via a sequence of hops along a path connecting the top electrode to the bottom electrode , and the rate of transport and/or recombination is dramatically affected by variations in the local magnetic field along the path , as found in numerous experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . in the transport regime , this effect is known as organic magnetoresistance ( omar ) , and the corresponding effect in the electroluminescent output we will denote as organic magnetoelectroluminescence ( omel ) . </S>",
    "<S> typically the source of that inhomogeneous field is the nuclear hyperfine field , which is random and spatially uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of omar can be traced back to interactions between paramagnetic charge pairs that occur at bottle - neck sites ( sites that crucially affect the transport and/or electroluminescent properties ) . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions are often spin - selective , and the reaction rate depends on the angle between the local spin - quantization axis ( provided by the local magnetic field ) for the two paramagnetic species . </S>",
    "<S> an applied magnetic field exceeding the hyperfine field strength forces this angle to be close to zero everywhere in the film , which shows up as magnetoconductance ( mc ) and/or magnetoelectroluminescence ( mel ) with typical features like those in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]b .    </S>",
    "<S> large gradients in the magnitude of the random local field can lead to fringe - field - driven mc and mel , and devices were constructed that utilize fringe fields from an unsaturated magnetic film to supply such gradients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper will primarily discuss such fringe - field effects , but `` ordinary '' omar and omel ( based on , _ e.g. _ , hyperfine fields ) is also investigated as a reference . </S>",
    "<S> the exact nature of the paramagnetic pairs remains hotly debated , and the possibilities include electron - hole pair recombination to form singlet or triplet excitons @xcite , @xmath0 or @xmath1 recombination to form singlet bipolarons @xcite , and collision reactions between electrons or holes with long lived triplet excitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the fringe - field mel mechanism is driven by fringe - field gradients , independent of the mechanism of ordinary omar and omel , the effects presented here should be found in organic materials independent of the mechanism of omar and omel , including in materials where there is no omar and omel@xcite .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*a * our devices are omar / oled devices fabricated on top of a ferromagnetic thin film . </S>",
    "<S> the device fabrication starts with the metal deposition of a ferromagnetic multilayered thin film made of cobalt ( co ) and platinum ( pt ) . </S>",
    "<S> those films have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ; the spins tend to align in the direction orthogonal to the film plane . in presence of a large magnetic field out of the film plane </S>",
    "<S> the co@xmath2pt films are uniformly magnetized with all the spins pointing opposite to the direction of the applied field . at lower fields the films form magnetic domains  some regions with spins pointing up and others with spins pointing down  to lower the magnetostatic energy . </S>",
    "<S> these magnetic domains create strong varying fringe fields close to the surface of the co@xmath2pt films , which penetrate the omar / oled device . in order to electrically insulate the omar / oled device from the ferromagnetic film we deposit a thin dielectric followed by a conductive nonmagnetic layer on top of the magnetic film . </S>",
    "<S> these electrically insulated magnetic films prove that fringe fields  and not electrical currents  are responsible for the coupling between the ferromagnetic layer and the omar / oled device . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strength and spatial correlation length of magnetic fringe fields depend sensitively on the distance from the magnetic film to the organic film . </S>",
    "<S> the insulating layer increases this distance reducing the effect . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we report results primarily on devices without this layer , which show the largest effects , and study devices with insulating layers to rule out spin injection and tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistive devices .    a conducting polymer layer ( 20  nm ) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ) poly(styrenesulfonate ) ( pedot : pss , referred to as simply pedot from now on ) was spin - coated from water suspension and serves as the hole - injecting layer . </S>",
    "<S> pedot is commonly employed for this purpose in organic light - emitting diode devices.@xcite we chose poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene ] ( mehppv ) as the luminescent polymer , as it is widely used as a red emitter in oleds@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mehppv layer ( 55  nm ) was deposited by spin - coating from toluene solution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , calcium ( ca ) ( 6 nm , serving as the electron - injecting top contact ) covered by aluminum ( al ) ( 12  nm ) was deposited by vacuum evaporation through a shadow mask . </S>",
    "<S> the active device area is roughly 1  mm@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the al capping layer is required to protect the highly reactive ca layer . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the pedot and ca electrodes to the device resistance ( and magnetoresistance ) are negligible , since they are metals , whereas mehppv is an intrinsic semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the el is measured through the semitransparent top electrode , and recorded by a photomultiplier tube . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements reported here are at room temperature .    figure  [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*b * shows a typical mc and mel trace , and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*c * the iv and el curves , for an organic device without a magnetic film and whose mc / mel is therefore caused by the random hyperfine fields , as described above . </S>",
    "<S> this device will serve us as a reference when , later on , we will discuss fringe - field induced mc / mel . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the hyperfine induced mc and mel responses have a magnitude of @xmath4 5 % and @xmath4 10 % , respectively , in our mehppv devices . </S>",
    "<S> the effects essentially saturate for applied fields in excess of 0.1 t , are non - hysteretic , and have a full - width - at - half - maximum of approximately 20 mt . </S>",
    "<S> the effects are also independent of the direction of the applied magnetic field , and nearly independent of the mehppv layer thickness . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we have chosen to work with a thin mehppv layer ( 55 nm ) such that the distance from the ferromagnetic film does not vary much between different locations in the mehppv film .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn our attention to the mc / mel responses of the fringe - field omar devices , and the correlation between these effects and the film magnetization , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*d * shows the measured mc and mel curves , and * e * shows the magnetization loop measured by magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) ( see methods section ) . in these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the device plane , and is swept smoothly from large negative to large positive fields ( black lines ) and back ( red lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the magnetization response is hysteretic , and that @xmath5 assumes its saturation value @xmath6 for fields larger than approximately 0.25  t in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is unsaturated between roughly @xmath7 and @xmath8  t. the mc / mel curves outside the unsaturated magnetization regime clearly mirror the data in non - magnetic devices ( panel * b * ) , and are explained by the `` normal '' hyperfine omar effect . in the unsaturated region , </S>",
    "<S> the data curves develop characteristic `` ears '' . </S>",
    "<S> these are the signature of fringe - field effects . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously given a detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the transport aspect of this effect.@xcite in the present work , we demonstrate for the first time that fringe - field effects lead to a sizable room - temperature mel response , of up to 6% at room temperature for the present device . </S>",
    "<S> this can be comparable to mel effects that occur only at low temperature , such as those recently reported in spin - valves@xcite and high - magnetic - field effects for oleds@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next we examine the relation between the magnetic film s response characteristics and mc / mel by fabricating omar / oled devices on several different ferromagnetic electrodes . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the different magnetic responses are studied by fabricating ferromagnetic films consisting of cobalt ( co ) and platinum ( pt ) multilayers with a different number of repeats , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we studied devices with @xmath10 @xmath11 , @xmath12 and 30 ( film thicknesses varied from 4  nm to 24  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization in the ferromagnetic films reverses through nucleation , growth , and annihilation of magnetic domains . when the magnetic films are saturated ( all spins pointing towards the same direction ) there are no magnetic fringe fields on top . </S>",
    "<S> when the magnetic films are unsaturated the strength of the magnetic fringe fields created by magnetic domains increases ( almost linearly ) with the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer ( i.e. , with the number of repeats ) . </S>",
    "<S> properties of co@xmath2pt ferromagnetic films have been characterized in detail ( see refs . and ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dependenceonrepeats ] shows that the hysteretic magnetoresistance of the organic layer is directly correlated with the hysteretic magnetization of the ferromagnetic film . </S>",
    "<S> the fringe - field `` ears '' occur only in the unsaturated regime , where film s magnetization breaks into domains with fringe fields occurring near the domain boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : isolateddevice ] shows data similar to that reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dependenceonrepeats ] , but now for a device with an additional sio@xmath13 layer inserted between the magnetic film and the omar / oled device . </S>",
    "<S> this data exhibits all the same characteristics of the data without the insulating layer , and proves that the coupling between the magnetic film and the organic device is magnetic rather than electrical in nature . </S>",
    "<S> in particular this excludes mechanisms such as tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance and spin - injection effects as the origin of the observed effects . </S>",
    "<S> the `` ears '' are however significantly smaller in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> however , this was to be expected , since the insulating layer leads to a significantly larger separation between magnetic film and omar / oled device as the overall spacer layer thickness increases from 20 nm to 45 nm with the layer inserted . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously examined@xcite the dependence of the magnitude of the fringe - field magnetoresistance on the spacer layer thickness .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic domains can be present at zero applied field in our magnetic films . </S>",
    "<S> such remanent states are prepared by applying a perpendicular field close to the film s coercive field and then removing it ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : remanentmel]*a * ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization measurements and imaging prove that remanent domain states relax only slightly upon removal of the field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have access to remanent magnetization states ranging from negative to positive saturation . at zero applied field </S>",
    "<S> we observed how remanent fringe fields increase the conductance of the organic layer mehppv , suppressing omar . </S>",
    "<S> the same effect with a smaller strength was observed in the organic semiconductor alq@xmath14@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : remanentmel]*bd * shows mc and mel of a 55  nm thick mehppv film on top of a magnetic layer both in presence of and at zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the blue line depicts the measured values in presence of magnetic field whereas the red lines trace the values measured after removing the applied field ( a sketch of the measuring sequence is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : remanentmel]*a * ) : we first saturated the sample with a large negative field , then we set a positive field value from 0 to 0.3  t and measured the conductivity of the organic layer ( blue points ) , and then we removed the applied field and again measured the organic s conductivity ( red points ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electroluminiscence increases up to 6@xmath15 for remanent magnetic domain states of the ferromagnetic layer . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to fringe fields from the same domain configuration in an applied magnetic field ( near the coercive field ) the mel increases rather than decreases .    </S>",
    "<S> we now examine whether the large fringe - field effects observed in the mel can be explained by theory . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a two - site model where an electron and hole ( a polaron pair ) occupy two nearby sites . </S>",
    "<S> the spin configuration of the polaron pair undergoes transitions due to the different magnetic interactions present ; in our case these interactions consist of @xmath16 which are the applied , hyperfine , and fringe - field hamiltonians respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the polaron pairs recombine into excitons at different rates , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , depending on the pair s spin since the singlet and triplet states have different energies and wavefunctions@xcite ( see . </S>",
    "<S> schematic fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*a * ) ; alternatively the pair could disassociate at a rate @xmath19 . once an exciton is formed , the large exchange energy precludes any further spin evolution . in the absence of large spin - orbit interactions , spin selection rules </S>",
    "<S> dictate that exciton recombination ( i.e. photon emission ) occurs only from the singlet exciton state . assuming that radiative recombination is the only viable pathway for a newly formed singlet exciton </S>",
    "<S> , each singlet exciton will produce a single photon such that mel can be defined in terms of @xmath20 , the singlet fraction of excitons : @xmath21/x_s(0)$ ] .    to calculate the mel we employ the stochastic liouville equation for the polaron pair spin density matrix , @xmath22:@xcite @xmath23 - \\frac{1}{2 } \\ {   k_s p_s + k_t p_t , \\rho \\ } - k_d \\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the singlet and triplet projection operators . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state singlet and triplet exciton fractions are@xcite @xmath26dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 runs over @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> all rates ( times ) are in units of the hyperfine field frequency ( period ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) where @xmath32 is the width of the gaussian distribution of hyperfine fields . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    to proceed with the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , one must have knowledge of the fringe fields present in the organic layer . in our previous analysis@xcite on fringe - field </S>",
    "<S> induced magneto - resistance , elementary magnetostatics were used to calculate fringe fields from xmcd images of the magnetic domains . </S>",
    "<S> the samples described herein have the same composition . </S>",
    "<S> we use therefore the statistical analysis from the aforementioned xmcd images to model the fringe - field distributions . </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that fringe fields vanish at magnetic saturation and are largest and most varying at @xmath35 , we model the fringe - field distribution as normal distribution with mean zero and a field dependent standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> each component of the fringe - field gradient , @xmath36 is modeled likewise . </S>",
    "<S> the field dependent standard deviations follow a parabola defined in the upper half - plane according to @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the field at which the magnet starts developing domains ( obtainable from either the moke data or the mel measurements ) and @xmath40 is the field corresponding roughly to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 and @xmath42 mark the parabola s vertex and are the only free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , from analysis of samples of the same composition on which xmcd images have been acquired , their values are roughly 40 mt and 1 mt / nm respectively for a spacer width of 20 nm .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of this theory and model are shown in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : remanentmel]*c*. the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are chosen from figure [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*e*. the values of @xmath17(=@xmath43 ) and @xmath18(=@xmath44 ) are chosen to achieve a saturated mel percentage near that of figure [ fig : mainexperimentalfigure]*d * ( @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values for the hopping rates fall into the intermediate hopping regime ( @xmath46 ) which is necessary to have any fringe - field effect .    </S>",
    "<S> remanent fringe fields generated from the domain structure of the magnetic film cause the observed dramatic modification of the electroluminescence from an organic light emitting diode at room temperature . as a uniform , perpendicularly magnetized film produces no remanent fields , the source of these fringe fields is the regions where the magnetization changes most rapidly , corresponding to domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> the faster the magnetization changes , or the smaller the domain size , the larger the remanent fields . </S>",
    "<S> thus this approach of interfacing magnetic information encoded in the domain structure with an organic light emitting diode should become more effective and efficient as the magnetic domain sizes shrink . </S>",
    "<S> we note as well that the mel is significantly larger than the mc , indicating that ( for mehppv ) fringe - field optical coupling and readout will have greater sensitivity than fringe - field electrical coupling and readout of magnetic information . </S>"
