    "inflation is a paradigm in search of a unique model , that may eventually be described within a complete theory of particle physics  @xcite . for the moment we just have the basics or fundamentals of inflation , and do not just have a single ( definitive ) realization of inflation , but many .",
    "so , how do we construct a consistent model of inflation within particle physics ?",
    "first , we have to provide an effective scalar field , the inflaton ; but what is the nature of this inflaton field ? then we have to give a dynamics for this field , some effective potential that is sufficiently flat for inflation to proceed ; but how do we attain such flatness ?",
    "furthermore , the amplitude and tilt of ( scalar and tensor ) metric fluctuations should agree with the observed cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies , as well as the lss matter distribution seen by deep galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "these observations suggest an approximately scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic gaussian curvature perturbations with an amplitude of a few parts in @xmath1 .    over the years",
    "there have been a handful of particle physics candidates of inflation  @xcite based on a variety of concepts : a ) _ symmetry breaking _ ( to trigger the end of inflation ) , in models of hybrid inflation  @xcite ; b ) _ supersymmetry _ ( in order to cancel dangerous polynomial loop corrections ) which gives rise to reasonably flat directions like in d- or f - term inflation  @xcite ; and c ) _ string theory _ ( in search of a consistent theory of gravity at the quantum level  @xcite ) , which generically gives slow - roll parameters of order one , and thus makes sufficient inflation difficult to realize .    recently , the proposals of refs .",
    "@xcite have managed to derive some of the inflationary properties from concrete non - supersymmetric stringy ( brane ) configurations .",
    "a new development started in the mid - nineties , within @xmath2 superstring theory , with the `` discovery '' of the d(p)-branes , i.e. non - perturbative extended ( p+1)-dimensional objects on which fundamental strings could live and/or attach their ends to . in the presence of branes , strings can satisfy two distinct boundary conditions  @xcite : @xmath3 { \\rm dirichlet : } \\ & \\left.\\partial_\\sigma   x^\\mu(\\tau , \\sigma)\\right|_{\\rm brane } = 0\\,.\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]        [ dbranes ]    these d - branes are dynamic objects , whose forces arise from the exchange of open and closed string modes between them . one can compute exactly ( within string theory ) the potential corresponding to the interaction between dp - dp or dp-@xmath4 branes  @xcite .",
    "there are two possible types of modes exchanged between branes : ramond - ramond ( r - r ) modes ( fermions , @xmath5-potentials ) and neveu - schwarz - neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) modes ( graviton , dilaton ) .",
    "when supersymmetry is preserved , the ns - ns and r - r charges cancel and there is no net force between the branes .    in that case , the 1-loop amplitude due to exchange of string modes cancels exactly , @xmath6 , where  @xcite @xmath7\\,.\\ ] ] thus , two parallel dp - branes constitute a stable bps state . the tree - level potential is solely determined by the sum of the branes tensions , @xmath8 constant , and therefore generates no force .    in this context , it was proposed by dvali and tye  @xcite the idea of _ brane inflation _ , in which the role of the inflaton field is played by the interbrane separation @xmath9 .",
    "they treated the potential phenomenologically , without actually deriving it from string theory . just assuming gauss law for the massless modes propagating between branes",
    ", they wrote the potential at large distances as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of compact dimensions transverse to the branes and @xmath12 is a certain coefficient , in principle derivable from string theory . with this potential ,",
    "inflation occurs , but requires unnatural fine tuning of @xmath13 in order to have sufficient number of @xmath0-folds  .",
    "one of the main interests of dealing with these non - perturbative objects in string theory is that they are extended objects of dimension ( p+1 ) and , in principle , our ( 3 + 1 ) world could be embedded in them .",
    "if the forces between these objects give rise to effective potentials for certain scalars , one could then produce inflation within the branes , in the context of string theory , and thus explain our present homogeneity and flatness .",
    "this is what makes the scenario very attractive .",
    "[ openclose ]",
    "soon after the proposal of dvali and tye , two groups obtained independently an exact expression for @xmath14 in the case of maximal supersymmetry breaking of the bps , i.e. with a brane and an antibrane  @xcite .",
    "since the antibrane has opposite rr charges than the brane , the 1-loop amplitude does not vanish , @xmath15 , and thus there appears a force at 1-loop between the brane and the antibrane .",
    "let us suppose for concreteness that the brane has dimension ( 3 + 1 ) like our own world , and thus consider a system of d3-@xmath16 branes .",
    "such branes have ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions which are neumann with respect to the propagation of the strings embedded in them , and @xmath17 transverse compactified dimensions , which are assumed to be fixed somehow ,   along which the bulk strings satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions",
    ". an schematic view of this brane - antibrane system can be seen in fig .",
    "the branes are separated a certain distance apart in the compactified space , as represented by the crosses in the planes @xmath18 .    .",
    "the branes are located at particular points on the remaining six compact directions @xmath19.,width=453 ]    [ angled3 ]    at large distances , the 1-loop amplitude is dominated by the term @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the massless propagator in @xmath22 dimensions . as we will see , the proportionality constant depends on the string theory couplings and can be calculated explicitly .    on the other hand , at short distances , it is well known  @xcite that the low energy effective theory of the brane - antibrane system contains a tachyon whose mass squared becomes negative , @xmath23 below a certain distance @xmath24 , of order the string scale .",
    "a tachyon signals the instability of the system and therefore the end of inflation .",
    "in fact , the behavior of the system is very similar to that of hybrid inflation  @xcite .",
    "it is probably the first example of the generic model of hybrid inflation in the context of string theory .",
    "this simple model , however , has a fundamental flaw : after inflation , the brane - antibrane disappear completely ( they mutually annihilate ) , radiating into the bulk , not along the brane , and thus would _ not _ produce the required reheating of the universe after inflation responsible for the subsequent stages of big bang cosmology .",
    "there are a few ways out , by including different types of branes of higher dimension which decay into lower - dimensional branes , see @xcite , or by adding extra degrees of freedom like electric or magnetic fluxes on the branes , which will prevent their complete annihilation .    in any case , this model does not produce enough inflation to solve the flatness and homogeneity problems .",
    "the reason is quite simple : superstring theory give coefficients and couplings that are of order one in string units , and therefore , the brane and antibrane attract eachother too strongly and collide before the brane - world has time to expand sufficiently to solve those problems .",
    "let us see this explicitly for the case of d3-@xmath16 branes  @xcite .",
    "the 4-dimensional effective action for the interbrane separation @xmath9 is given by @xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the d3-brane tension , and the 4-dimensional planck mass is given by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the volume of the 6-dimensional compactified space ( here assumed to be a 6-torus of common radius @xmath29 ) .",
    "the effective potential for the inflaton can be obtained from string theory ( for @xmath30 ) , assuming that the distance between branes is large compared with the string scale but small compared with the compactified space ( @xmath31 ) , as @xmath32 where @xmath33  is the canonically normalized inflaton field , and  @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to compute the number of @xmath0-folds  from this potential , @xmath35 in the approximation in which this potential was computed , @xmath36 , the number of @xmath0-folds  is much smaller than one and thus insufficient for solving the homogeneity and flatness problems .",
    "put another way , in order to have enough number of @xmath0-folds  , @xmath37 , one would require @xmath38 , and therefore , one would have to take into account the infinite series of images of the branes ( and antibranes ) in the compactified space .",
    "this was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to give rise to an effective potential which could marginally provide enough number of @xmath0-folds  , as long as the initial conditions of inflation were chosen very close to a symmetric configuration .",
    "we will not pursue this issue here , but will now describe an alternative and quite robust solution for brane inflation that we came up with in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in order to overcome the difficulties of constructing successful inflationary models from brane - antibrane interactions , where supersymmetry is maximally broken , we considered in ref",
    ".  @xcite the possibility of generating the inflaton potential from the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry , so that one can smoothly turn on an interaction between the branes .",
    "there are many ways in which this general idea can be implemented : by a slight rotation of the branes intersecting at small angles ( equivalent , in the t - dual picture , to adding small magnetic fluxes through the branes ) , by considering small relative velocities between the branes , by introducing orientifolds , etc . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the interactions that arise between intersecting branes at a small angle . if the angle is small then supersymmetry is only slightly broken , so that the force between the branes is relatively small .",
    "it is this flat potential which will drive inflation , as the branes are attracted to each other , until a tachyonic instability develops when the branes are at short distances compared with the string scale .",
    "this is a signal that a more stable configuration with the same r - r total charge is available , which triggers the end of inflation .    in the following",
    "we elaborate on one of the simplest examples : a pair of d4-branes intersecting at a small angle in some compact directions  @xcite .",
    "the interaction can be arbitrarily weak by choosing the appropriate angle to be sufficiently small .",
    "the brane - antibrane system is the extreme supersymmetry breaking case , where the angle is maximised such that the orientation for one brane is opposite to the other .",
    "the interaction is so strong in this case , that inflation seems hard to realise  @xcite .",
    "one should take very particular initial conditions on the system for inflation to proceed  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the supersymmetry breaking parameter is small , a huge number of @xmath0-folds  are available within a small change of the internal configuration of the system , due to the almost flatness of the potential ; in this way the initial conditions do not play an important role .",
    "thus , we find that inflation is robust in systems that are not so far from supersymmetry preserving ones .",
    "the following table gives us some perspective on the model building possibilities for inflation in the context of stringy brane constructions .",

    "one of the interesting features of branes in string theory is that they can wrap around certain cycles in the compactified space .",
    "the wrapping has associated with it an angle @xmath42 and a length @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "these parameters will characterize the inflaton potential .",
    "in our paper  @xcite , we considerd type iia string theory on @xmath44 , with @xmath45 a ( squared ) six torus .",
    "we put two d4-branes expanding 3 + 1 world - volume dimensions in @xmath46 , with their fourth spatial dimension wrapping some given 1-cycles of length @xmath43 on one of the @xmath47 in @xmath45 . in fig .",

    "the case we are considering can be understood as an intermediate case between the supersymmetric parallel branes ( @xmath55 ) and the extreme brane - antibrane pair ( @xmath56 ) , with the angle playing the role of the smooth supersymmetry breaking parameter in units of the string length .     with opposite orientations .",

    "these conditions state that the sum of the homology cycles where the d - branes wrap must add up to zero . in our case",
    "these conditions do not play an important role , since we can take a brane , with the opposite total charge , far away in the transverse directions .",
    "this brane will act as an _ expectator _ during the dynamical evolution of the other two branes .",

    "10 , while the imaginary part is in green .    in the field theory limit ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 )",
    "we can consider the infinite tower of landau levels , while ignoring the string levels , _",
    "the finite low energy effective potential at zero separation @xmath89 becomes  @xcite @xmath147 the imaginary part can be related , through the optical theorem , with the rate of decay of the false vacuum towards the minimum of the tachyon potential , @xmath148 this implies a ( perturbative ) reheating temperature @xmath149 which coincides with the reheating temperature that would have resulted if all the false vacuum energy would have been converted into radiation soon after symmetry breaking .",
    "note that since the rate of expansion during inflation @xmath150 is much smaller than the mass scale @xmath151 , the false vacuum energy density @xmath152 is not diluted by the expansion before reheating , as typically occurs in chaotic inflation , and all of it is converted into radiation , reheating the universe to a temperature @xmath153 where we have assumed @xmath154 for the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at reheating .",
    "however , the actual process of reheating is probably very complicated and there is always the possibility that some fields may have their occupation numbers increased exponentially due to parametric resonance  @xcite or tachyonic preheating  @xcite . moreover , a significant fraction of the initial potential energy may be released in the form of gravitational waves , which will go both to the bulk and into the brane .",
    "one must be sure that the bulk gravitons do not reheat at too high a temperature , because their energy does not redshift inside the large compact dimensions ( contrary to our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world , where radiation redshifts with the scale factor like @xmath155 ) , and they could interact again with our ( presently cold ) brane world and inject energy in the form of gamma rays , in conflict with present bounds from observations of the diffuse gamma ray background  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , since the fundamental gravitational scale , @xmath156 , in this model is large enough compared with all the other scales , the coupling of those bulk graviton modes to the brane is suppressed , and thus we do not expect in principle any danger with the diffuse gamma ray background  @xcite , but a detailed study remains to be done .",
    "we have shown how string theory provides an interesting realization of hybrid inflation , in the context of d - branes wrapped around the compactification scale , where the inflaton is the interbrane separation .",
    "the small parameter needed for sufficient inflation and a small amplitude of fluctuations in the cmb is due here to the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry via a small angle between the branes , which induces a very flat potential for the inflaton .",
    "this model gives a geometrical realization of inflation which is very robust with respect to initial conditions in the compact space .",
    "moreover , the slow - roll conditions can be interpreted as ( geometrical ) conditions on the relative velocity and acceleration of the branes towards eachother .",
    "the number of @xmath0-folds  is directly related to the distance between branes , and metric perturbations , that later give rise to temperature anisotropies , are nothing but fluctuations on the interbrane distance .",
    "the model makes very specific predictions : for a concrete compactification radius in units of the string scale , @xmath157 , we find a mass scale @xmath158 gev .",
    "moreover , the radius of compactification turns out to be @xmath159 gev .",
    "the scalar tilt is @xmath160 , with negligible scale dependence , @xmath161 , and there is an insignificant amount of tensor modes or gravitational waves .",
    "the reheating of the universe occurs through the conversion of all the false vacuum energy during inflation into radiation , as the tachyon condenses and is driven towards its vev . a detailed account of this process is still lacking .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the davis meeting on cosmic inflation for a very warm and friendly atmosphere .",
    "it s also a pleasure to thank my friends and collaborators ral rabadn and frederic zamora , for sharing with me their insight about branes in string theory .",
