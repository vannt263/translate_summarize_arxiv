    "many of the high - energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher - dimensional spacetimes . in particular , the idea of extra dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories .",

    "models involving a compact universe with non - trivial topology play a very important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation . and compactification of spatial dimensions leads to a number of interesting quantum field theoretical effects , which include instabilities in interacting field theories , topological mass generation , and symmetry breaking .    in the case of non - trivial topology ,",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on fields give rise to a modification of the spectrum for vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to casimir - type contributions in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see @xcite and references therein ) . in models of the kaluza - klein type",
    ", the casimir effect has been used as a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields and as a source for dynamical compactification of the extra dimensions , in particular , for quantum kaluza - klein gravity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the casimir energy can also serve as a model for dark energy needed for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , recent measurements of the casimir forces between macroscopic bodies provide a sensitive test for constraining the parameters of long - range interactions , as predicted by modern unification theories of fundamental interactions @xcite .",
    "the influence of extra compactified dimensions on the casimir effect in the classical configuration of two parallel plates has been recently discussed in @xcite-@xcite , for the case of a massless scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions , and in @xcite-@xcite , for the electromagnetic field for perfectly conducting boundary conditions .",
    "more recently , interest has concentrated on the topic of the casimir effect in braneworld models with large extra dimensions . in this type of models ( for a review see @xcite ) the concept of brane is used as a submanifold embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , on which the standard - model particles are confined .",

    "therefore , robin type conditions are needed when one deals with conformally invariant theories in the presence of boundaries and wishes to preserve this invariance .",
    "it is interesting to note that a quantum scalar field satisfying robin conditions on the boundary of a cavity violates the bekenstein s entropy - to - energy bound near certain points in the space of the parameter defining the boundary conditions @xcite .",
