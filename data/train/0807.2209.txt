    "taking the symmetry relation as a measure of the quality of the numerical mfa , let us compare the results of the different scaling and averaging techniques . in fig .",
    "[ fig - symdeg - finalcomparison ] we show the best analyses obtained from box - size scaling and system - size scaling using typical average and ensemble average in both cases .",
    "data corresponding to the typical average has been extracted from ref .  .",
    "the performance of the system - size scaling technique ( solid lines ) is clearly much better than box - size scaling ( dashed lines ) .",
    "this is not a very surprising result , since one expects finite - size effects to be more enhanced in box - size scaling . for each of the scaling procedures the ensemble",
    "average ( black ) is also better than the typical average ( grey ) .",
    "this may be not be so intuitive , since due to the nature of the distribution functions for @xmath2 , @xcite one might expect the typical average to be a better choice .",
    "however it turns out that the ensemble average does better in revealing the true behaviour in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the upper panel shows the numerical evaluation of the symmetry law as a function of @xmath54 .",

    "there s no correspondence between the abscissa axes of the upper and lower plots . ]    let us recall the strategies that give the best result for each of the techniques . for typical average",
    "the best symmetry is achieved using the largest system sizes available , either for box - size or system - size scaling , although the number of realizations is not the highest .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , using ensemble average , the safest choice is to consider smaller system sizes for which a very large number of disorder realizations can be obtained .",
    "in this work we have studied the symmetry law for the multifractal spectrum of the electronic states at the metal - insulator transition in the 3d anderson model , using the ensemble - averaged scaling law of the gipr .",
    "a detailed analysis has revealed how the mfa is affected by system size and number of samples .",
    "system - size scaling with ensemble average has manifested itself as the most adequate method to perform numerical mfa , in contrast to box - size scaling and typical average which had been mainly the method of choice in previous studies .",
    "@xcite since the ensemble average is strongly based on the number of disorder realizations , from a numerical point of view , the best strategy to carry out the analysis is to consider a sensible range of system sizes for which a very large number of states can be generated .",
    "all our results suggest that the symmetry law is true in the thermodynamic limit , since a better agreement is found whenever a high enough number of disorder realizations and larger system sizes are considered .",
    "the symmetry relation then provides a powerful tool to obtain a complete picture of @xmath1 at criticality , since it would suffice to obtain numerically the spectrum in the most reliable region , @xmath146 , and apply the symmetry to complete the function for @xmath101 .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath1 also provide some useful information about the validity of previous analytical results . the perturbative analysis in @xmath147 made by wegner",
    "@xcite led to the following spectrum @xmath148}{4\\epsilon } \\\\ & - \\frac{\\zeta ( 3)}{64}{[(\\alpha - d)^2-\\epsilon^2][(\\alpha - d)^2 + 15\\epsilon^2 ] } \\end{split } \\label{eq - wegner}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 denotes the riemann zeta function .",
    "the first two terms in constitute the usual parabolic approximation ( pa ) .",
    "the extra quartic term is an overestimation in 3d ( @xmath150 ) , as explicitly stated by wegner , which gives a non - acceptable spectrum as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - conjectured ] . to obtain the correct @xmath151 ) at @xmath150 all the other terms in the perturbation series are required .",
    "( solid gray ) and conjectured @xmath1 at the mit for the 3d anderson model ( solid black ) .",
    "the dotted black areas highlight forbidden regions for @xmath1 .",
    "the grey shaded and white areas can be connected through the symmetry relation , . ]",
    "remarkably wegner s result obeys the symmetry relation , provided the spectrum is indeed terminated at @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the symmetry can also be easily checked by calculating @xmath154 , which can be written as a power series in @xmath155 whose coefficients are all invariant under the transformation @xmath156 .",
    "the results from the numerical mfa seem to suggest that @xmath1 tends to approach a finite negative value when @xmath77 .",
    "this would imply that the spectrum has a termination point .",
    "the existence of a termination point at @xmath152 requires that the function @xmath12 has a zero slope for @xmath54 greater than a certain critical value @xmath157 .",
    "@xcite this latter fact is also suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig-3dbox - ens - tau](a ) .",
    "moreover the numerically obtained spectrum is between the pa and @xmath158 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - conjectured ] . in view of this",
    "we are tempted to conjecture that perhaps the pa and @xmath158 are bounds for the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit . in this",
    "were true then @xmath1 must necessarily terminate at finite values .",
    "furthermore let us speculate that the left termination point is @xmath159 which implies @xmath160 according to the symmetry [ fig .",
    "[ fig - conjectured ] ] , and thus the spectrum would not attain negative values at its right end , determined by the smallest wavefunction amplitudes .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 at the 3d anderson transition would hence be close to the black line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - conjectured ] .    in conclusion , in spite of the large amount of information that the numerical analyses , here and in ref .  , and the symmetry relation have provided , the complete picture of the multifractal spectrum for the mit in 3d is still elusive . in particular further research",
    "is needed to confirm the existence of termination points and whether these happen at negative values on both sides , since this has important implications upon the distribution functions of the wavefunction amplitudes near the localisation - delocalisation transition .",
