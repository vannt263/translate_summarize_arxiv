    "magnetars represent a sub - class of isolated neutron stars ( nss ) with a unique set of observational properties .",

    "they are usually observed as bright x - ray sources with luminosities , @xmath11  erg  s@xmath1 , larger than their corresponding rotational energy losses ( @xmath12  erg  s@xmath1 , where @xmath13 is the ns moment of inertia , @xmath14  g  @xmath15 ) .",

    "assuming dipole braking , the majority of magnetar timing properties indicate strong surface dipole magnetic fields ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19  g is the electron quantum critical field ) , while their internal magnetic fields are thought to be even larger @xcite .",
    "the decay of their internal and external magnetic fields represent their dominant energy reservoir , powering their persistent emission as well as their bursting activity .",
    "finally , a few magnetars have also shown pulsed radio emission @xcite .    in the last decade",
    ", several observational results have demonstrated that the above properties are neither exclusively seen in magnetars nor solely attributed to super strong surface dipole fields ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "for the purposes of this study , we single out below two of these results .    psr  j1846@xmath210258 is a @xmath22  s rotation - powered pulsar ( rpp ) located inside the supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 75 .",
    "its spin - down rate implies a surface dipole magnetic field @xmath23  g , on the boundary between rpps and classical magnetars @xcite .",
    "unlike magnetars , however , psr  j1846@xmath210258 has a large rotational energy loss rate , @xmath24  erg  s@xmath1 , well above its persistent x - ray luminosity , @xmath25  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "its rotational energy loss also powers a bright pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , @xmath26  erg  s@xmath1 , with an x - ray efficiency , @xmath27% , somewhat high but not unusual for a young rpp @xcite .",
    "the source spindown age is @xmath28yr for a measured breaking index of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of short hard x - ray bursts from psr  j1846@xmath210258 , a trademark of typical magnetar sources .",
    "the bursts were accompanied by flux enhancement and timing noise , also typical properties of magnetars .",
    "these observational results demonstrated that an otherwise typical rpp can in fact show typical magnetar properties , bridging the gap between the two ns sub - populations .",
    "the discovery in 2009 of sgr  j0418 + 5729 strengthened the above conclusion .",
    "the source was detected after it emitted two short hard x - ray bursts @xcite , and exhibited typical magnetar - like properties : a period of @xmath30  s , x - ray flux enhancement soon after the bursts , and a quasi - exponential flux decay in the following months @xcite .",
    "a spin - down rate could only be measured after 3 years of observations and it was found to be the lowest of any magnetar , @xmath31  s  s@xmath1 , implying a surface dipole field @xmath32  g @xcite .",
    "this field is well within the range of regular rpps , indicating that a strong dipole field is not a requirement for displaying magnetar - like properties in an isolated ns .",
    "while the above observational results demonstrate a possible link between rpps and magnetars , there exists one rpp property , which has not thus far been identified in a typical magnetar .",
    "most rpps possess a large rotational energy loss rate that powers a relativistic particle wind , often seen as a pwn , whose x - ray emission is the result of synchrotron radiation of the shocked wind @xcite .",
    "magnetars , on the other hand , have rotational energy loss rates on average about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than rpps ( although with some overlap in their distributions , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making the production of a rotationally powered nebula less likely",
    ". magnetars , however , are thought to produce particle outflows , either steady or released during bursting episodes @xcite , for which the only observational examples is the transient radio emission detected from sgrs  1900@xmath3314 and 1806@xmath2120 following their 1999 and 2004 giant flares , respectively @xcite .    is a typical magnetar , discovered on 2011 august 7 , when it emitted a short hard x - ray burst .",

    "moreover , the same extended emission was detected in an archival _ xmm - newton _  observation 6 years earlier at a similar flux level ( albeit with large uncertainties ) , while the magnetar was @xmath3823 times fainter ( y+12 ) . due to the above unusual properties , y+12 conjectured that this extended emission might be a wind nebula powered by the magnetar .",
    "@xcite later argued that this emission was a dust scattering halo occurring in a giant molecular cloud located along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "they suggested that a previous outburst from the source prior to 2005 might be responsible for its earlier detection .",

    ", source events were extracted from specific regions as described in section  [ specana ] and shown in figure  [ firstlookim ] .",
    "background events were extracted from a 5-radius circle on the same ccd as the source , excluding point sources as derived from a source detection algorithm ( section  [ imana ] ) . the task _ backscale _ was used to calculate the exact area of the source and background regions , correcting for excluded point sources , ccd gaps , and bad pixels .",
    "we generated response matrix files using the sas task _ rmfgen _ , while ancillary response files were generated using the sas task _",

    "all quoted uncertainties in this study are at the @xmath42 level , unless otherwise noted .",
    "+     we used the _ images _ script to produce a cleaned image of the nebula for both _ xmm - newton_observations .",

    "this is the deepest image of the extended emission around the magnetar .",
    "figure  [ firstlookim ] shows a clear trend in hardness , with the inner part of the extended emission appearing harder than its outskirts . to identify and remove the contribution of any background ( or foreground ) point sources within the field of the extended emission , we ran two source detection algorithms .",
    "the ` edetectchain ` uses an exposure corrected image to look for sources within a 5@xmath445 pixel box using a surrounding background of a @xmath45 pixel box beyond the source in all input images ( e.g. , pn , mos1 , and mos2 ) simultaneously .",
    "it then masks the sources found , and creates a background map of the field - of - view through a 2-d spline fit .",
    "finally , using the values from this background map , it searches for sources within a 5@xmath445 pixel box in all input images simultaneously .",
    "the ` edetectchain ` algorithm also performs point source or extended emission fits to each of the sources found through the task ` emldetect ` .",
    "the other detection algorithm we ran on the data ( pn , mos1 , and mos2 separately ) is ` wavdetect ` .",
    "this algorithm correlates a `` ricker wavelet '' ( `` mexican hat wavelet '' ) function to a given 2-d image .",
    "pixels with large positive correlation and a low significance ( @xmath46 ) are flagged as sources and removed from the data , and the same correlations are performed again until no more sources are found .",
    "this algorithm is developed for _ chandra _  observations , but it can also be used with _",

    "2 ( lower panels ) in the 2 - 10  kev range , along with the results from both source - detection algorithms . both algorithms produce similar results , except that the ` edetectchain ` algorithm flags a source at the position of the magnetar in obs .  2 , while the wavdetect algorithm does not .",
    "we note that the source detected using ` edetectchain ` at the magnetar position in both observations is flagged as extended .",

    ".        to determine whether the magnetar emission is detected above the extended - emission level , we estimated the number of counts and computed the hardness ratios ( hrs ) in both observations . using the pn camera in the 2 - 10 kev",

    "the difference of @xmath49 counts between the two observations represents a @xmath50 significance .",
    "moreover , the radial profiles of the two observations in the 2 - 10 kev range ( figure  [ radprof ] ) centered at the magnetar position @xcite reveal a central excess emission in obs .  1 compared to obs .  2 .",
    "beyond a few arcseconds , the radial profiles from both observations are similar .",
    "we conclude that there is a @xmath50 count excess around the magnetar position in obs .  1 .",
    "we estimate the hr ( hb@xmath51/sb@xmath52 ) within the 20  circle by first estimating the photon flux in the two energy bands for all instruments separately .",
    "the photon flux is estimated by correcting the number of counts observed within the 20  circle for ccd gaps and bad pixels , and then normalizing by the `` livetime '' exposure and the average detector effective area at the source location in the given energy band . finally , we subtracted the background contribution from these photon fluxes using the background region as described in section  [ obs ] .",
    "the photon fluxes in the different energy bands and the hardness ratios for obs .  1 and obs .  2 , are shown in table  [ photfluxhr ] .",
    "we also derived the hardness ratios of two other regions within the extended emission following the same method as above .",
    "the first region , hereafter the inner - ellipse , is indicated by the smaller red ellipse in figure  [ firstlookim ] , and the second region , hereafter the outer - ellipse , is indicated by the larger red ellipse .",
    "these elliptical regions were defined according to their spectral appearance in the image .",
    "point sources within each of these two regions ( defined as crossed - out circles with 15radii ) , as derived from the source detection algorithms , are excluded .",
    "the magnetar ( shown as a red circle with a 20-radius ) was excluded from the inner - ellipse , and the inner - ellipse was excluded from the outer - ellipse .",
    "these photon fluxes and hardness ratios for obs .  1 and obs .  2 , are shown in table  [ photfluxhr ] .",
    "two interesting conclusions can be drawn from the results in table  [ photfluxhr ] .",
    "first , the hr in a 20circle around the magnetar position indicates a softer spectrum in obs .  1 than in obs .  2",
    "moreover , the hr around the magnetar position in obs .",
    "2 is almost identical to the hr in the inner - ellipse of the two observations .",
    "hence , given the central excess counts in obs .  1 compared to obs .  2 , and the softer spectrum ,",
    "we conclude that the magnetar is weakly detected in obs .  1 , while it has faded as indicated by the harder extended emission during obs .  2 .",
    "second , the hr of the outer - ellipse is noticeably smaller than the hr of the inner - ellipse , indicating spectral softening with increasing distance from the magnetar position .",
    "we extracted the source spectra from the area within the big ellipse ( @xmath53 ) in figure  [ firstlookim ] ( upper panels ) , excluding the point sources detected in each observation .",
    "the background spectrum is extracted from a region as defined in section  [ obs ] .",
    "we then subtracted the background spectrum from the source emission spectrum , as is usually done for point sources .",
    "this approach should be valid for our case since the extent of the emission is too small to cause any strong vignetting effects .",
    "we used the cash statistic ( c - stat in xspec ) for our parameter estimation , and grouped the spectra to have 5 counts per bin .",
    "we fit the pn , mos1 , and mos2 spectra of obs .  1 and obs .  2 simultaneously with an absorbed pl model .",
    "we linked all parameters between the two observations assuming no variability in the extended emission .",
    "we find a pl photon index @xmath6 and an absorbing hydrogen column density @xmath54  @xmath2 .",
    "since we are using c - stat for parameter estimation , we used the xspec command ` goodness ` to evaluate the goodness of fit .",
    "the ` goodness ` command simulates a user - defined number of spectra based on a gaussian distribution of the best fit model parameters .",
    "it derives the percentage of simulations with fit statistic lower than that for the data . in the case where the data are drawn from the model ,",
    "this percentage should be around 50% . simulating 10000 realizations of our data based on the above best fit model",
    ", we find that 57% of the simulated spectra have a fit statistic lower than the best fit statistic , c - stat=4210.82 for 4140 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , implying that our simple model provides a good fit to the data .",
    "we find an absorption corrected 0.5 - 10  kev flux @xmath55  erg  s@xmath1  @xmath2 , which translates into a luminosity @xmath56  @xmath57  erg  s@xmath1 , assuming a distance to the source @xmath58  kpc .",

    "@xmath63 background subtraction method .",
    "@xmath64 modelled background method .",
    "we also looked for flux variability between obs .  1 and obs .  2 by leaving the normalization of the pl free to vary between the two spectra .",
    "we find a c - stat of 4212.95 for 4139 d.o.f , and the normalization of the two spectra are consistent with each other at the @xmath42 level . to establish whether the change in c - stat is statistically significant , we estimated the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) in both cases .",
    "the bic for the case of linking the normalization of the pl , i.e. , constant flux , is 4260 , while the bic for a varying pl normalization is 4255 .",
    "this gives @xmath65 , which implies that the case of the free pl normalization , i.e. , a varying flux , is not statistically preferable over the simpler case , i.e. , constant flux .",
    "following y+12 , we also performed a spectral analysis by first modeling the background spectrum , and then including its contribution to the source spectral model .",
    "hence , we fit the background spectrum with a combination of two thermal components ( for the local hot bubble and interstellar / intergalactic medium ) , and 2 pls , one with a photon index fixed to 1.5 ( assuming unresolved background active galactic nuclei , e.g. , distant quasars and/or nearby low luminosity active galactic nuclei ; @xcite ) and absorbed by a column density equal to the average value of the galactic absorption towards the direction of the background region , @xmath66  @xmath15 .",
    "the temperatures of the two thermal components are @xmath380.2  kev and @xmath381.1  kev ; both reasonable for the thermal emission in the diffuse x - ray background @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath67 for the unabsorbed foreground pl component , which could represent some low level solar flaring background below our exclusion threshold ( section  [ obs ] ) .",
    "we also added gaussian emission lines to model the instrumental lines seen in pn and mos ( see the extended science analysis software , esas ) . after establishing the best fit model to the background spectrum",
    ", we included the source spectra from the two observations and added an absorbed pl component to the total spectral model .",

    "this results in an f - test statistic of 3.2 and a false - rejection probability of 8% , implying that a variable flux is not statistically favored over a constant flux .",
    "the imaging analysis of the nebula ( figure  [ firstlookim ] ) revealed a softening trend with distance from the central magnetar . to investigate this trend , we extracted the pn , mos1 , and mos2 spectra of the two regions within the nebula as identified in section  [ imana ] , i.e. , the inner- and outer - ellipses .",
    "we used c - stat in the fitting process and grouped the spectra to have 5 counts per bin .",

    "this value is an order of magnitude lower than the one we derive here",
    ". this high brightness could be the effect of its collision with the w41 snr reverse shock ( assuming connection between the two ) .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , the compression of the nebula by the reverse shock tends to increase its particle and magnetic energy , as well as the strength of its magnetic field .",
    "this tends to rapidly increase the nebula synchrotron luminosity .",
    "an alternative possibility for the unusual high efficiency and brightness in the wind nebula around  is that there might be an extra source of power in addition to the rotational energy of the magnetar .",
    "this extra source of power is most likely the decay of the magnetar s ultra - strong magnetic field , with an inferred surface dipole magnetic field of @xmath146  g. particle outflows , either steady or released during bursting episodes , could be driven out from the magnetar as alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "the best observational evidence are the transient radio nebulae detected from the magnetars sgr  1900@xmath3314 and sgr  1806@xmath2120 following their respective 1998 and 2004 gfs @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the nebula we see around is steady over a minimum of a 9  yr period , hence , intrinsically different from the radio nebulae seen around sgr  1900@xmath3314 and sgr  1806@xmath2120 following the gfs .",
    "particle outflows in magnetars , however , are not restrained to gf emission , and are expected during regular bursting episodes @xcite , particularly given that the magnetic eddington limit is low enough that it can be breached even by the short bursts @xcite . indeed , the strong torque changes seen in many magnetars point towards a particle wind escaping out through open field lines out to ( at least ) the light cylinder @xcite . moreover , the discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations in the short - recurring bursts of magnetars point to alfvn waves driven by ongoing seismic activity @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the case of particle outflow following short magnetar bursts and found that the cooling time - scale is very long ( compared to the time between bursts ) such that the nebular emission is steady rather than transient , in agreement with our results .",
    "the above qualitative theoretical reasoning raises the question about why would  be the only magnetar so far powering a wind nebula , given that previous searches around individual magnetars have returned no sign of extended emission attributable to wind nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "with only one observed so far , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "nevertheless ,  has some interesting characteristics that are not shared with the entire magnetar population .",
    "first , the environment of  is extremely crowded , with a _ fermi _  gev , a h.e.s.s .",
    "tev source , a snr , a gmc , and an oh maser in its vicinity @xcite .",
    "the relationship between all these sources is unclear .",
    "however , it is tempting to speculate that environmental effects from such a rich field could be playing a role in the production of this wind nebula ( e.g. , triggering of pair cascade by external gamma - rays from a nearby source ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the  x - ray luminosity in quiescence is @xmath147  erg  s@xmath1 . only five other magnetars ( sgr  0418@xmath335729 , sgr  1745@xmath212900 , xte  j1810@xmath21197 , swift  j1822.3@xmath211606 , 3xmm  j185246.6@xmath33003317 ) have luminosities @xmath148  erg  s@xmath1 . among these 5",

    "hence , from an observational point of view , it seems that the combination of very weak x - ray luminosity , a magnetar - like b - field strength , and a somewhat large @xmath142 ( properties that are only shared by the galactic center magnetar sgr  1745@xmath212900 ) may favor of a wind nebula production .",
    "another possibility is that the  magnetar / nebula system is an older analogue to the kes  75 system , where the central pulsar evolves into a magnetar while preserving its originial pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .    finally , we briefly discuss the softening trend within the nebula ( see section  [ specana ] ) . while the usual cause for spectral differences within wind nebula around pulsars is a change in spectral curvature rather than absorption ,",
    "this latter scenario should be considered in our case . the heavy absorption for  is thought to be due to the existence of a gmc in its direction @xcite .",
    "the densities within these clouds could be non - uniform causing spatially variable absorption .",
    "the magnetar , surrounded by the inner nebula , was a bright x - ray point source in 2011 when in outburst .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum was fit in y+12 with an absorbed pl ( @xmath151  @xmath2 ) and an absorbed black - body ( bb , @xmath152  @xmath2 ) .",
    "y+12 found that the absorbed bb fit ( @xmath153 for 232 d.o.f . ) was superior to the pl fit ( @xmath154 for 232 d.o.f . ) , possibly indicating that the true absorption towards the magnetar , and by extrapolation the inner nebula , is similar to the absorption towards the outer nebula .",
    "this potentially points to a change in the photon index as the primary cause for the spectral softening that we see in our data , strengthening the case for a typical wind nebula around , similar to pwne around young pulsars",
    ". such softening trend could be attributed to synchrotron burnoff of energetic particles .",
    "this conclusion , however , requires a deeper x - ray observation to firmly confirm it and/or a theoretically - motivated spectral modeling ( i.e. , whether emission from marginally fast cooling electrons with a given initial power - law energy distribution could quantitatively explain the spectral softening observed ) .",
    "in this paper , we studied two deep _ xmm - newton _  observations of the extended emission around the magnetar .",
    "the observations , separated by 7 months , were taken in march 2014 and october 2014 , 2.5 and 3.1 years after the source went into outburst .",
    "the magnetar is weakly detected in the first observation , while it faded below detection limit during the second one .",
    "the extended emission is clearly detected in both observations ; it is best described with a non - thermal pl model with a photon index @xmath155 . fitting these spectra with archival ones taken 3 and 9 years earlier , we find that the flux and spectral curvature of the xtended emission is constant with @xmath156  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath1 .",
    "this provides a strong observational case confirming the y+12 results that  is indeed the first magnetar to show a surrounding wind nebula .",
