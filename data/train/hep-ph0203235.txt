    "unlike the spin structure function @xmath20 , which has a clear interpretation in the quark - parton model ( qpm ) , the @xmath75 structure function is sensitive to higher - twist quark - gluon correlation effect and is not readily interpreted in qpm .",

    "the nomad collaboration has also measured@xcite @xmath6 and @xmath178 polarization in neutrino dis .",
    "the new hermes measurement@xcite covers a kinematic range ( roughly @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) much broader than previous dis experiments@xcite .",
    "preliminary result on the average spin transfer in this kinematic region is @xmath181 .",
    "the @xmath182 dependence is consistent with the previous nomad result@xcite .",
    "the predictions of several model calculations@xcite for a rising spin transfer with increasing @xmath152 are not observed in the data , although the statistical accuracy is limited .",
    "a new detector was installed at hermes to enhance the acceptance of @xmath6 detection for future measurements@xcite .",
    "new results on exclusive meson production from hermes and clas collaborations have been presented in this symposium .",
    "the current interest in hard exclusive processes is largely due to the fact that qcd factorization was proved to be valid for exclusive meson production with longitudinal virtual photons@xcite .",
    "such factorization allowed new means to extract the unpolarized and polarized gpd .",
    "in particular , unpolarized gpds can be measured with exclusive vector meson production , while polarized gdps can be probed via exclusive pseudoscalar meson production .",
    "bianchi@xcite presented the preliminary hermes results on the longitudinal component of the exclusive @xmath183 and @xmath147 meson production cross sections .",
    "the data are in good agreement with a calculation@xcite based on gpd . for exclusive pseudoscalar meson production ,",
    "the hermes collaboration measured the single spin azimuthal asymmetry in the reaction @xmath184 .",
    "the asymmetry is found@xcite to be very large ( @xmath185 ) and has a sign opposite to that of inclusive @xmath149 production  @xcite .",
    "the clas collaboration recently reported@xcite the first measurement of double spin asymmetry in the @xmath186 reaction .",
    "this observable is sensitive to the contributions from various resonances , and the data indicate the dominance of the helicity-1/2 contribution in the second and third resonance regions .",
    "a new measurement@xcite of the @xmath7 spin asymmetry has been carried out at hall - a in jlab using polarized @xmath65 target .",
    "the value of @xmath7 as @xmath187 is sensitive to the underlying models describing valence quark dynamics in the nucleon .",
    "isospin and su(6 ) symmetries predict @xmath188 as @xmath187 , while pqcd approaches@xcite predict @xmath189 as @xmath8 approaches 1 .",
    "preliminary jlab result@xcite for @xmath7 in the @xmath190 range show that @xmath7 turns positive for large @xmath8 .",
    "a definitive measurement of @xmath7 with high accuracy at very large @xmath8 has been considered for the 12 gev cebaf upgrade@xcite .",
    "there has been an enormous progress in various areas of spin physics experiments since the last circum - pan - pacific spin symposium in 1999 .",
    "an incomplete list of the major progress would include the following :    * first jlab measurements on spin structure functions have provided new information on @xmath191 and the generalized gdh sum at the resonance region . *",
    "observation of the azimuthal single spin asymmetry at hermes in semi - inclusive pion production holds a great promise for measuring transversity in the near future .",
    "* observation of the dvcs process at hermes and jlab has generated much interest and could develop into an extensive program for measuring generalized parton distributions . * various spin observables in exclusive meson electroproductions",
    "are being measured at hermes and jlab . *",
    "commissioning of the rhic - spin has been successfully carried out@xcite .",
    "many new results are anticipated in the near future :    * first results from rhic - spin . * first results on @xmath192 and @xmath193 ) from the 5-parameter analysis of the hermes sidis data . *",
    "first measurement of the transversity ( @xmath194 ) at hermes using transversely polarized targets . * precise data on dvcs from hermes and jlab .",
    "* @xmath133 from slac , compass , hermes , and rhic - spin . * additional low-@xmath14 data from jlab . * and much more ....",
