    "because it differs fundamentally from the interference phenomena of classical physics , quantum interference has remained a continuing topic for discussion and debate since quantum theory s early days .",
    "the essence of this difference is exhibited by the two - slit experiment . from both the classical and schrdinger wave perspectives , the two slit interference pattern",
    "is easily described in terms of the overlapping contributions of the wave which have passed through each slit .",
    "the wave perspective also explains the disappearance of the interference pattern when one of the slits is closed .",
    "however , interference experiments using low intensity electron or photon beams in which only one particle at a time passes through a two - slit apparatus have shown that the accumulated effect when both slits are open is an interference pattern like that produced by higher intensity ensembles and that the pattern likewise disappears when one slit is closed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this peculiar behavior necessitates an answer to the question `` how does a particle passing through one slit sense that the other slit is open or closed ? '' when interference is considered from the perspective of a single quantum particle .",
    "although this question concerning single particle behaviour has been answered and explained theoretically in terms of a non - local exchange of modular momentum @xcite , there have been no direct experimental observations of such an exchange to support this explanation .",
    "this lack of observations is due to the fact that the conditions required to observe a non - local exchange of modular momentum are precisely those that make the associated modular variable completely uncertain and unobservable .",
    "recently , however , it was suggested that an experimental methodology using weak measurements performed on a pre- and post - selected ensemble of particles could be exploited in order to observe an effect _ induced _ by a non - local exchange of modular momentum .",
    "this methodology was illustrated by a _",
    "experiment which used a twin mach - zehnder interferometer to duplicate relevant aspects of the two - slit interference experiment @xcite .",
    "this paper reports the results of an optical twin mach - zehnder interferometer experiment similar to that described in the above _ gedanken _ experiment .",
    "this experiment yielded measured weak values that were consistent with the associated theoretical prediction describing the effect induced by a non - local exchange of modular momentum .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section the theories of modular momentum , dynamical non - locality , weak measurements , and weak values are briefly summarized .",
    "a description of the experimental apparatus and an overview of the experiment are presented in section iii .",
    "the experimental results are discussed in section iv .",
    "concluding remarks comprise the final section of this paper .",
    "consider a quantum particle propagating in the positive @xmath0-direction perpendicular to the plane of two symmetric slits which are separated by a distance @xmath1 in the @xmath2-direction ( the slit at @xmath3 will be referred to as the left slit ) . at time @xmath4 after the particle passes through the slits its wavefunction is the superposition @xmath5 where the @xmath6 s are assumed to be identical `` wave packets '' which do not overlap at @xmath7 and @xmath8 is their relative phase .",
    "although information about @xmath8 can be obtained from the spatial interference pattern @xmath9 produced by an ensemble of such particles on a screen parallel to and at an appropriate distance @xmath10 from the plane of the slits at time @xmath11 , there are no local measurements using operators of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are non - negative integers , that can be performed upon the initial non - overlapping wave packets that will determine @xmath8 .",
    "the relative phase @xmath8 is thus a non - local feature of quantum mechanics .    the induced momentum uncertainty and the heisenberg uncertainty principle are traditionally used to explain the loss of the interference pattern when one slit is closed .",
    "however , measuring which slit the particle passes through does not necessarily increase the momentum uncertainty .",
    "this - along with the fact that position and momentum observables and their moments are not sensitive to relative phase ( prior to wave packet overlap ) - suggests that these observables , as well as the heisenberg uncertainty principle , are not the appropriate physical concepts for describing quantum interference phenomena .",
    "the ( modular ) operator @xmath15 and its modular property , however , do provide an alternative physical basis for the rational description of quantum interference .",
    "unlike the operators @xmath12 , the expectation value of the operator @xmath15 with respect to @xmath16 is sensitive to @xmath8 - even when the two  wavepackets do nt overlap .",
    "this sensitivity results from the action of @xmath17 upon @xmath18 which overlaps the two wavepackets in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) by translating @xmath19 to @xmath20 . also , since @xmath15 is invariant under the replacement @xmath21 , @xmath22 , (",
    "because @xmath23 ) , it depends upon values of the _ modular momentum _",
    "@xmath24 instead of those of @xmath25 .",
    "this modular property establishes a fundamental relationship between modular momentum uncertainty and quantum interference via the complete uncertainty principle : `` @xmath26 is completely uncertain ( i.e. all its values are uniformly distributed over @xmath27 ) if and only if @xmath28 for every positive integer @xmath29 '' .",
    "when this principle is applied to the two slit case , it is found that while the required expectation value with respect to @xmath30 does not vanish for @xmath31 , it does vanish for every @xmath29 when the expectation value is with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , when the left slit is closed , i.e. it is known that the particle passed through the right slit , then @xmath32 becomes completely uncertain so that all knowledge about @xmath33 is lost and the interference pattern vanishes .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion provides the formalism for describing and understanding the notion of _ dynamical non - locality_. within the context of two slits , the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath34 is given by @xmath35   = \\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\left (   \\widehat{v}\\left (   x\\right )   -\\widehat{v}\\left (   x-\\ell\\right ) \\right )   e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\widehat{p}_{x}\\ell } , \\label{1a}%\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the potential operator for the right ( left ) slit .",
    "this is a non - local equation of motion and therefore has no classical analogue : only the potential at each slit is involved in the rate of change of @xmath15 - i.e. there are no forces involved - and the potential at the left slit influences this rate of change even if @xmath39 - i.e. when the particle is initially localized at the right slit .",
    "consequently , the effect of closing the left slit produces non - locally a change in modular momentum while leaving the expectation values of the associated moments of momentum unchanged .",
    "more specifically , the modular operator is conserved when both slits are open since @xmath40 so that @xmath41 . however , if the left slit is closed and the particle is localized at the right slit , then @xmath42 @xmath43 and the modular momentum is changed non - locally as a result of the change in the potential at the left slit . interference is destroyed and the modular momentum becomes completely uncertain - thereby rendering it unobservable .",
    "in fact , it is in this manner that the complete uncertainty principle also reconciles dynamical non - locality with causality .    for additional details concerning the theory of modular momentum and dynamical non - locality",
    "the reader is invited to consult references @xcite .",
    "although the exchange of modular momentum is not directly observable , it has been suggested that dynamical non - locality induces effects which can be observed using weak measurements of pre- and post - selected ensembles of particles .",
    "weak measurements arise in the von neumann description of a quantum measurement at time @xmath44 of a time - independent observable @xmath45 that describes a quantum system in an initial fixed pre - selected state @xmath46 at @xmath44 , where the set @xmath47 indexes the eigenstates @xmath48 of @xmath45 . in this description",
    "the hamiltonian for the interaction between the measurement apparatus and the quantum system is@xmath49 here @xmath50 defines the strength of the impulsive measurement interaction at @xmath44 and @xmath51 is the momentum operator for the pointer of the measurement apparatus which is in the initial state @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the pointer s position operator that is conjugate to @xmath51 and assume that @xmath54 is real valued with @xmath55 .",
    "prior to the measurement the pre - selected system and the pointer are in the tensor product state @xmath56 . immediately following the measurement",
    "the combined system is in the state @xmath57 where use has been made of the fact that @xmath58 .",
    "the exponential factor in this equation is the translation operator @xmath59 for @xmath60 in its @xmath61-representation .",
    "it is defined by the action @xmath62 which translates the pointer s wavefunction over a distance @xmath63 parallel to the @xmath61-axis .",
    "the @xmath61-representation of the combined system and pointer state is@xmath64    when the measurement interaction is strong , the quantum system is appreciably disturbed and its state `` collapses '' to an eigenstate @xmath65 leaving the pointer in the state @xmath66 with probability @xmath67 .",
    "strong measurements of an ensemble of identically prepared systems yield @xmath68 as the centroid of the pointer probability distribution@xmath69 with @xmath70 as the measured value of @xmath45 .",
    "a _ weak measurement _ of @xmath45 occurs when the interaction strength @xmath71 is sufficiently small so that the system is essentially undisturbed and the uncertainty @xmath72 is much larger than @xmath45 s eigenvalue separation . in this case ,",
    "eq.([2 ] ) is the superposition of broad overlapping @xmath73 terms .",
    "although a single measurement provides little information about @xmath45 , many repetitions allow the centroid of eq.([2 ] ) to be determined to any desired accuracy .",
    "if a system state is post - selected after a weak measurement is performed , then the resulting pointer state is@xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , is the post - selected state at @xmath44 .",

    "since @xmath85 is real valued , then eq.([3 ] ) corresponds to a broad pointer position distribution with a single peak at @xmath86 with @xmath87 as the measured value of @xmath45 .",
    "this condition occurs when both of the following inequalities relating @xmath71 and the pointer momentum uncertainty @xmath88 are satisfied @xcite : @xmath89    it is important to keep in mind that although the weak measurement of @xmath45 occurs at time @xmath44 so that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are states at @xmath44 , these states result from states that are pre - selected and post - selected at times @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "therefore it is necessary to propagate the pre - selected state forward in time from @xmath94 to @xmath44 and the post - selected state backward in time from @xmath95 to @xmath44 in order to calculate @xmath83 at @xmath44 .",
    "the reader is invited to consult references @xcite for additional details concerning the theoretical and experimental aspects of weak measurements and weak values .",
    "as mentioned above , the setup for this experiment follows that of the optical _ gedanken _ experiment discussed in @xcite where a twin mach - zehnder interferometer is used to replicate aspects of the two - slit interference experiment .",
    "a schematic of the apparatus used in this experiment is shown in figure 1 . here",
    "the paths followed by photons have been  labeled using the traditional `` right '' ( @xmath96 ) and `` left '' ( @xmath97 ) notation @xmath98 . for future reference",
    "an overlay of the `` metaphorical '' two slits emulated by the twin mach - zehnder interferometer is also provided in this figure .",
    "note that paths @xmath99 and @xmath100 correspond to photon paths through the right and left slits , respectively .",
    "thus , blocking path @xmath100 corresponds to closing the left slit .    since photons",
    "do not interact with one another , it is not necessary to perform the experiment in such a manner that only one photon at a time traverses the interferometer .",
    "accordingly , large ensembles of photons of wavelength @xmath101 @xmath102 produced by a classically intense laser diode source were used in this experiment .",
    "a @xmath103 @xmath104 diameter pinhole spatially filtered the photon beam into a smooth gaussian - like shape .",
    "the exiting beam had an optical power of @xmath105 @xmath106 ( @xmath107 photons / s ) and was collimated with a @xmath108 @xmath109 focal length lens .",
    "a mirror launched the collimated beam into the interferometer via the input path @xmath110 .",
    "three identical non - polarizing cube 50/50 beam - splitters - labeled bs1 , bs2 , bs3 in figure 1 - along with four identical mirrors - labeled m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 in figure 1 - formed the basic architecture of the interferometer ( the collection bs1 , m1 , m2 , and bs2 ( bs2 , m3 , m4 , and bs3 ) is hereafter referred to as `` _ _ the first ( second ) mach - zehnder _ _ '' ) .",
    "the beam emerging along path @xmath111 was neutral density filtered before reaching a @xmath112 pixel resolution machine vision camera which recorded the beam s two dimensional intensity distribution .",
    "the optical power of the beam reaching the camera was approximately four to five orders of magnitude smaller than that exiting the pinhole .",
    "each camera pixel had a size @xmath113 @xmath104 @xmath114 @xmath113 @xmath104 and a @xmath115 digital intensity range .",
    "the pixel saturation level exceeded the measured maximum pixel intensity level of the images obtained from this experiment .",
    "the _ gedanken _ experiment utilized slightly tilted thin glass plates placed at locations in paths @xmath116 and @xmath117 to perform weak measurements of the projection operators @xmath118 and @xmath119 by producing transverse spatial shifts in the photon paths that were small relative to the uncertainty in the transverse position of a photon .",
    "the theoretically predicted change in the weak values of these operators when path @xmath100 is blocked was interpreted as an observable effect induced in the first mach - zehnder by an associated non - local exchange of modular momentum produced by blocking path @xmath100 in the second mach - zehnder ( direct measurement of the modular momentum exchange is not possible because blocking path @xmath100 in the second mach - zehnder makes the modular variable completely uncertain - thereby destroying all information about the modular momentum ) .    in this experiment , however , a piezoelectrically driven computer controlled stage was used instead to produce small changes in the location of mirror m1 ( in the direction shown in figure 1 ) in order to produce a series of transverse spatial shifts in the photon beam that could be made small compared to the uncertainty in a photon s transverse position .",
    "this approach proved more efficient than the tilted plate method and was equivalent to performing weak measurements of the projection operator @xmath120 located in path @xmath117 .",
    "as shown - both theoretically and experimentally - below , the weak value of @xmath121 changes in accordance with the _ gedanken _ experiment when path @xmath100 is blocked .",
    "this change can also be interpreted as a dynamical non - locality induced effect .    by avoiding the use of micro - positioners as much as possible ,",
    "the setup was passively stable for several tens of minutes .",
    "the entire apparatus was also enclosed in a @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath114 @xmath122 @xmath123 covered box to provide additional isolation from the environment . in order that the box not have to be uncovered during",
    "a measurement data run , electromagnetic shutters were used as much as possible to block and unblock photon paths and the piezoelectric stage and camera were computer controlled using data collected by the camera . because of these features , all required measurement data were collected before opto - mechanical instability occurred using only one initial fine alignment . a data analysis and graphing software tool",
    "was developed and used to automatically process the camera images .",
    "the essence of this experiment involved comparing the measured weak values of the operator @xmath124 for two distinct ( data ) classes of weak measurements .",
    "for each of these weak measurement classes the pre - selected state prior to the time of @xmath125 s measurement was the spatial mode @xmath126 and the post - selected state after @xmath125 s measurement time was the spatial mode @xmath127 .",
    "also , for each of these classes the path lengths in the first mach - zehnder were arranged so that photons effectively only emerged from bs2 along path @xmath99 in spatial mode @xmath128 .",
    "thus , paths @xmath99 and @xmath100 will be referred to as the `` bright '' and `` dark '' paths , respectively . arranging the first mach - zehnder in this way corresponded to localizing a photon at the right slit of a two slit screen prior to its traversing the screen .",
    "weak measurements of @xmath125 for both measurement classes were made while the apparatus was in this configuration - except that a shutter blocked path @xmath100 for the second measurement class . blocking path @xmath100 in this manner corresponded to closing the left slit in a two slit screen while the photon is localized at the right slit .    if @xmath129 and @xmath130 correspond to the weak values of @xmath125 for the first and second measurement classes , respectively , then - since @xmath100 is a dark path -",
    "it might be expected that blocking path @xmath100 should have no effect upon the weak measurement of @xmath125 in @xmath117 , in which case @xmath131 . however ,",
    "when eq.([4 ] ) is used to calculate these weak values it is found that for the first measurement class ( which corresponds to both slits being open ) @xmath132 and for the second measurement class ( which corresponds to closing the left slit ) @xmath133 .",
    "more specifically , for the first measurement class , forward propagation of the pre - selected state @xmath134 and backward propagation of the post - selected state @xmath127 through the interferometer to where @xmath125 is measured yields the states @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , so that @xmath137   \\widehat{n}\\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (   i\\left\\vert l2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\vert r2\\right\\rangle \\right )   \\right ]   } { \\left [   -i\\left\\langle l2\\right\\vert \\right ]   \\left [   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (   i\\left\\vert l2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\vert r2\\right\\rangle \\right )   \\right ]   } = + 1\\ ] ] ( note that the theoretical weak value of @xmath138 is @xmath139 ) .",
    "similarly , for the second measurement class - with the dark path @xmath100 blocked - forward propagation of the pre - selected state @xmath134 and backward propagation of the post - selected state @xmath127 through the interferometer to where @xmath125 is measured yields the states @xmath135 and @xmath140 , respectively , so that @xmath141   \\widehat{n}\\left [   \\frac { 1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (   i\\left\\vert l2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\vert r2\\right\\rangle \\right )   \\right ]   } { \\left [   \\frac{1}{2}\\left (   -i\\left\\langle l2\\right\\vert + \\left\\langle r2\\right\\vert \\right )   \\right ]   \\left [   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}% } \\left (   i\\left\\vert l2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\vert r2\\right\\rangle \\right ) \\right ]   } = + \\frac{1}{2}%\\ ] ] ( note that the theoretical weak value of @xmath138 is also @xmath142 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath143 so that - similar to the _ gedanken _ experiment - weak value theory applied to this experiment predicts that blocking path @xmath100 produces a dramatic observable change in the weak value of @xmath125 when there are effectively no photons along path @xmath100 .",
    "following @xcite and using the two - slit case along with eq.([1a ] ) as guides , @xmath143 _ has an interpretation as being an effect induced in the first mach - zehnder by the non - local exchange of modular momentum that results from a change in the potential associated with blocking the dark _",

    ", however , a relative ( to the other two classes ) phase shift of @xmath145 @xmath146 was introduced into path @xmath147 so that backward propagation of the post - selected state @xmath127 backwards through the interferometer gives @xmath148 as the state where the measurement is made . again using @xmath149 as the forward",

    "this class of measurements served as a data consistency check by demonstrating that the weak values @xmath144 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 measured by this experiment were compliant with the theoretical ordering requirement@xmath152",
    "in order to experimentally demonstrate this induced @xmath143 effect , three sequences of weak measurements of @xmath125 - one sequence for each of the @xmath144 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 measurement classes - were generated following the configuration prescriptions outlined in the above overview of the experiment .",
    "different interaction strength ( @xmath71 ) values were produced for each sequence by varying the m1 position via controlling that of the piezoelectric stage .",

    "interestingly , if these offsets are treated as a constant bias , then removal of the bias from the measurement pairs in @xmath227 not only produces complete compliance with ( [ 7 ] ) in the weak measurement regime - but it also provides more overall symmetry in the data , as well as good agreement between the measured pointer displacements @xmath226 and @xmath228 in the weak measurement regime .",
    "as expected , the further the m1 displacement is outside the weak measurement regime the `` stronger '' the measurement becomes and the greater the discrepancy between the @xmath227 data and @xmath228 and between the @xmath218 data and @xmath219 .",
    "however , except for the data asymmetry associated with negative m1 displacements ( likely introduced by the complicated optical properties of the apparatus ) , the agreement between the @xmath221 data and @xmath222 remains good over the entire range of m1 displacements while the @xmath227 and @xmath218 data converge to @xmath222 .",
    "this feature in the data is completely consistent with the fact that in the limit of `` strong collapsing '' measurements , the measurement pointer is displaced by @xmath229 since@xmath230   \\widehat{n}\\left [ i\\left\\vert l2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\vert r2\\right\\rangle \\right ]   \\frac { 1}{\\sqrt{2}}=+\\frac{1}{2}%\\ ] ] ( refer to the discussion surrounding eq.([2 ] ) ) .",
    "this experiment used weak measurements of pre- and post - selected ensembles of photons in a twin mach - zehnder interferometer to observe an effect theoretically predicted to be induced in the first mach - zehnder by the non - local exchange of modular momentum produced by blocking the dark path in the second mach - zehnder ( it is intended that a second `` follow up '' paper be written which will detail the novel aspects of the apparatus and techniques used in this experiment ) .",
    "this effect is manifested as a dramatic change in the associated weak values .",
    "the attendant weak values measured by this experiment changed in complete accordance with the theoretical predictions .",
    "consequently , the results of this experiment support both the existence of such an effect and the authenticity of dynamical non - locality as its cause .    before closing",
    ", it is noted that - although this experiment was specifically designed for the purpose of confirming or denying the @xmath143 effect - it was observed that - for the weakest measurements with abscissa @xmath231 @xmath104 - the ratio of the number of camera pixels excited by the associated @xmath221 measurement to that excited by the associated @xmath218 measurement was @xmath232 .",
    "the drop in this excitation ratio was @xmath233 to @xmath234 times greater than expected based upon the alignment contrast ratios for the apparatus .",
    "this informal observation provides additional credence to dynamical non - locality as inducing the @xmath143 effect and suggests a future experiment that could further examine dynamical non - locality from this perspective .",
    "the authors thank yakir aharonov and jeff tollaksen for suggesting this experiment ; john gray and james troupe for constructive technical discussions ; and david niemi for his efforts in the instrumentation of this experiment .",
