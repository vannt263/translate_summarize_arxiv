    "during the last five years , gas - kinetic @xcite , fluid - dynamic @xcite , and other models have been developed , aiming at an understanding of stop - and - go traffic .",
    "the topic is related to the fields of non - linear dynamics @xcite , phase transitions @xcite , and stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "in addition , microscopic traffic models were proposed for the description of interacting driver - vehicle units .",
    "they can be classified into cellular automata models @xcite , which are discrete in space and time , and continuous models @xcite .",
    "the latter are required for detail studies of car - following behavior and traffic instabilities , which are necessary for an investigation of the consequences of technical optimization measures ( e.g.  of autopilots for an automatic control of vehicle acceleration and braking ) .    therefore , a research group of the bosch gmbh has recently recorded follow - the - leader data by means of a floating car @xmath0 which measured the vehicle speed @xmath1 , the netto distance @xmath2 to the car in front , the acceleration @xmath3 of it , and the relative velocity @xmath4 . by a correlation analysis",
    "it was demonstrated that , among all possible combinations of subsets of these four quantities , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 are the most significant variables for the description of vehicle dynamics @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ genforce ] , we will find plausible reasons for this .",
    "the follow - the - leader data , if plotted in the @xmath2-@xmath4-plane , show the characteristic oscillation of vehicle motion around states with relative velocity zero ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) , which was already reported by hoefs @xcite . except for the previously mentioned significance analysis ,",
    "the data were also used for calibrating existing microsimulation models . with the resulting optimal sets of parameter values",
    ", the models were simulated for the observed situation .",
    "that is , the first vehicle was moved according to its measured velocity , and the following vehicle was simulated according to the respective model under consideration , starting with the the same initial velocity and distance like the floating car .",
    "the average relative quadratic deviation @xmath5 between the simulated and actually measured distance ( cf .",
    "( [ de ] ) ) was used as a measure for the goodness of fit of the respective model @xcite .    in order to get improved results ,",
    "we have developed a generalized force model , in which each term and each parameter has a clear meaning .",
    "moreover , by parameter calibration it turns out that all model parameters have the right order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it can be easily said , how the parameter values will look like , if the speed limit , the acceleration capability , the average vehicle length , the visibility , or the reaction time is modified ( e.g.  due to technical measures ) .",
    "in addition , this model reaches a better goodness of fit at a reduced number of model parameters than the previous models .",
    "finally , the generalized force model manages to cope successfully with particular situations like vehicles approaching standing cars , in which other models produce accidents .",
    "the first microscopic traffic models were developed in the 1960ies .",
    "many of them are special cases of the follow - the - leader model proposed by gazis , herman , and rothery @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the dynamics of a vehicle @xmath0 with velocity @xmath6 at place @xmath7 is given by the equation of motion @xmath8 and the acceleration equation @xmath9 \\ , .\\ ] ] according to this , a driver adapts to the velocity @xmath10 of the car in front , but this is delayed by the adaptation time @xmath11s .",
    "the deceleration is proportional to the relative velocity @xmath12 where the proportionality factor @xmath13 reflects the sensitivity to the stimulus @xmath4 .",
    "the sensitivity was assumed to depend on the vehicle velocity and on the brutto distance @xmath14 in the following way : @xmath15^m}{[s_\\alpha(t)]^l } \\ , .\\ ] ] this choice allowed to fit all equilibrium velocity - density relations of the form @xmath16^{1/(1-m)}\\ ] ] by appropriate specification of the exponents @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 = maximum velocity , @xmath20 = spatial vehicle density , @xmath21 = maximum vehicle density ) .",
    "the best fit was reached for fractional exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 , so that this model has no obvious interpretation .",
    "apart from that , the model does not allow to distinguish drivers with different preferred velocity , and it can not describe the acceleration of a single vehicle correctly .    only a few years ago , bando , sugiyama _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a very charming microscopic traffic model . despite its simplicity and its few parameters , their optimal velocity model ( ovm )",
    "describes many properties of real traffic flows @xcite and is easily interpretable .",
    "it is based on the acceleration equation @xmath24 \\ , , \\ ] ] so that the vehicles adapt to a distance - dependent optimal velocity @xmath25 with a certain relaxation time @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the netto distance , where @xmath28 means the length of vehicle @xmath0 . like the follow - the - leader models ,",
    "the optimal velocity model is able to describe the formation of stop - and - go waves and emergent traffic jams , but it overcomes the afore mentioned problems .",
    "we carried out a calibration of the optimal velocity model with respect to the empirical follow - the - leader data , which we obtained from bosch . the optimization procedure based on the evolutionary boltzmann strategy @xcite , and the optimization criterion was the average relative quadratic deviation @xmath29 of the simulated distance @xmath30 from the measured vehicle distance @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting optimal parameter values for city traffic in stuttgart are @xmath32 , @xmath33 m/s , @xmath34 m/s , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "a comparison with the data shows that the extremely short relaxation time @xmath37s results in too high values of acceleration , which leads to an overshooting of the vehicle velocity ( cf .",
    "the unrealistically high accelerations also become obvious in figure  [ f2 ] , since empirical accelerations are limited to 4m / s@xmath38 ( cf .",
    "a similar problem occurs with the deceleration behavior , if a standing car ( e.g.  at the end of a traffic jam or in front of a red traffic light ) is approached from a large distance by an initially freely moving car .",
    "it turns out that the moving vehicle reacts too late to the vehicle at rest .",
    "the values of deceleration are unrealistic large , but still not sufficient to avoid an accident ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) .",
    "these problems are solved by the _",
    "@xmath39 proposed by bosch @xcite . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are model parameters .",
    "the regression model ( [ reg ] ) , which is based on a rational function , describes all aspects of vehicle dynamics in cities realistically ( cf",
    ".  figs .",
    "[ f5][f3 ] ) , but at the cost of additional parameters .",
    "whereas the optimal velocity model needs only 5 model parameters , the t3 model contains 11 parameters .",
    "if the model equations are scaled to dimensionless equations ( by scaling space or velocity and time by characteristic model quantities ) , the number of parameters is reduced by 2 .    in the following section",
    ", we will propose an alternative model which reaches about the same goodness of fit as the t3 model , but with a considerably smaller number of parameters .",
    "motivated by the success of so - called social force models in the description of behavioral changes @xcite , especially of pedestrian dynamics @xcite , we developed a related model for the dynamics of interacting vehicles . in setting up an equation of motion by specifying the effective acceleration and deceleration forces , the approach is analogous to the molecular - dynamic method which is used for the simulation of many - particle systems @xcite , e.g.  of driven granular media @xcite .    besides of various methodological similarities in the theoretical treatment of traffic and granular flows ,",
    "there are also phenomenological analogies like the formation of density waves @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the interactions are dissipative , i.e. they do not conserve kinetic energy . however , there are also differences . for granular media ,",
    "the interaction forces are short - ranged and belong to collision processes , where particles touch and temporarily deform each other .",
    "vehicle interactions are long - ranged and correspond to deceleration maneuvers .",
    "they are usually not related to collisions ( i.e.  accidents ) , since the drivers try to keep a safe distance @xmath42 from each other which can be considerably larger than the vehicle length ( cf .",
    "( [ safety ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the effective space requirements of vehicles are much larger than their actual size . moreover , vehicular interactions do not conserve momentum ( in contrast to granular ones ) .",
    "another difference between granular and traffic dynamics is , that the laws of granular interactions are very well known , pretty much like the basic laws of physics , whereas the laws of driver - vehicle dynamics ( if they exist at all ) are still to be established .",
    "the particular challenge of modeling vehicle dynamics is its dependence on factors like perceptions , psychological motivations and reactions , or social behaviors .",
    "thus , in contrast to physical processes , driver behavior can not be expected to be describeable by a few natural constants .    according to the social force concept , the amount and direction of a behavioral change ( here : the temporal change of velocity , i.e.  the acceleration ) is given by a sum of generalized forces .",
    "these reflect the different motivations which an individual feels at the same time , e.g.  in response to their respective environment .",
    "since these forces do not fulfill newton s laws like _ actio = reactio _ , they are called _ generalized forces . _ alternatively , they are named _ behavioral _ or _ social forces _ , since they mostly correspond to social interactions .",
    "the success of this approach in describing traffic dynamics is based on the fact that driver reactions to typical traffic situations are more or less automatic and determined by the optimal behavioral strategy ( which is the results of an initial learning process ) .",
    "a detailled motivation , description , and discussion of the social force concept is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the driver behavior is mainly given by the motivation to reach a certain desired velocity @xmath43 ( which will be reflected by an acceleration force @xmath44 ) and by the motivation to keep a safe distance to other cars @xmath45 ( which will be described by repulsive interaction forces @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 the fluctuating force @xmath48 may be used to include individual variations of driver behavior , but in our present investigations it was set to zero .",
    "if we assume that the acceleration force is proportional to the difference between desired and actual velocity and suppose that the most important interaction concerns the car @xmath49 in front , we end up with @xmath50 the acceleration time @xmath51 is a third of the time which a freely accelerating vehicle needs to reach 95% of the desired velocity .    now , we have to specify the interaction force @xmath52 . for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we would obtain the optimal velocity model , again .",
    "we extend this relation by a complementary term which should guarantee early enough and sufficient braking in cases of large relative velocities @xmath4 . this term should increase with growing velocity difference @xmath4 , but it should be only effective , if the velocity of the following vehicle is larger than that of the leading vehicle , i.e.  if the heaviside function @xmath55 is equal to 1 .",
    "moreover , the additional deceleration term should increase with decreasing distance @xmath2 , but vanish for large distance @xmath56 .",
    "the braking time @xmath57 belonging to this term should be smaller than @xmath51 , since deceleration capabilities of vehicles are greater than acceleration capabilities .",
    "we chose the following formula which meets the above conditions : @xmath58/r'_\\alpha } \\ , .",
    "\\label{interact}\\ ] ] this formula takes into account that vehicles prefer to keep a certain velocity - dependent safe distance @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the minimal vehicle distance and @xmath61 is the safe time headway ( i.e.  about the reaction time ) .",
    "@xmath62 can be interpreted as range of the braking interaction .",
    "we can further reduce the number of parameters ( and the numerical effort ) , if we replace the previous @xmath63-function ( [ ve ] ) by @xmath64/   r_\\alpha } \\big\\ }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{vspec}\\ ] ] in case of identical model parameters of all vehicles , the corresponding equilibrium velocity - distance relation results from the implicit condition @xmath65 and is depicted in figure  [ f4 ] .    the traffic model defined by equations ( [ force ] ) , ( [ interact ] ) , and ( [ vspec ] ) will , in the following , be called the _ generalized force model _ of traffic dynamics ( gfm ) .",
    "since all its seven parameters have a clear and measurable meaning , they should have the right order of magnitude .",
    "a calibration with respect to the follow - the - leader data shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "we found the following optimal parameter values : @xmath66 m/s , @xmath67s , @xmath68 m , @xmath69s , @xmath70s , @xmath71 m , and @xmath72 m .",
    "now , the acceleration time @xmath51 is more than twice as large as in the optimal velocity model , the braking time @xmath57 is smaller than @xmath51 , as demanded , and the reaction time @xmath61 is also realistic . note that the range @xmath73 of the acceleration interaction is much shorter than the range @xmath62 of the deceleration interaction .",
    "this is not only sensible , it is also the reason for the astonishingly good agreement with the empirical data .",
    "table  [ table1 ] compares the minimal values of the average relative quadratic deviation @xmath5 that could be reached for the different discussed traffic models by evolutionary parameter optimization @xcite .",
    "( the advantage of the applied boltzmann strategy is that this particular gradient method escapes local minima by means of a fluctuation term with eventually decreasing variance . )",
    "it turns out that the optimal velocity model is considerably improved by the t3 model .",
    "this is not surprising , since the goodness of fit should increase with the number of model parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the generalized force model reaches the best agreement with the data , although it includes only two third of the number of parameters of the t3 model .",
    "the simulation results for the generalized force model are depicted in figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "finally , the representation of the relative vehicle movement in the @xmath4-@xmath2-plane shows the expected oscillatory character of follow - the - leader behavior , which can cause the development of stop - and - go traffic ( cf .",
    "[ f7 ] ) .    in comparison with physical models",
    ", the generalized force model still seems to contain a lot of parameters .",
    "however , let us discuss this in more detail for the previously mentioned molecular - dynamic models of granular media . if we want to describe interactions of smooth , inelastic , and spherical grains , only , we need to know the particle size and the normal restitution coefficient related to translational energy dissipation . in cases of rough spheres ,",
    "we require two additional parameters , a tangential restitution coefficient and a friction coefficient @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the grains are non - spherical , the situation becomes even more complicated . in conclusion ,",
    "the small number of parameters occuring in physical models are often a result of simplifications and idealizations .",
    "finally , let us check the plausibility of the generalized force model . in order to do this ,",
    "we rewrite the model in the form @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77/r'_\\alpha\\ } \\ , .\\ ] ] for small velocity differences @xmath4 or large distances @xmath2 , we find @xmath78 so that vehicles try to approach the optimal velocity @xmath79 with a relaxation time @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to the optimal velocity model , but with a velocity - dependent function @xmath80 .",
    "if a vehicle is faster than the leading vehicle ( i.e.  @xmath81 ) and its distance is sufficiently small , we have @xmath82 which coincides with a car - following model in which the following vehicle adapts to the velocity of the vehicle in front . according to the formula for @xmath83 ,",
    "the deceleration is the stronger , the closer the vehicles come to each other .",
    "therefore , the limiting cases of the generalized force model behave very reasonably .",
    "we have calibrated several microscopic traffic models to city traffic , compared them with empirical follow - the - leader data , and investigated their properties .",
    "it turned out that one model showed too large accelerations and decelerations , but nevertheless caused accidents in certain situations .",
    "another model was a regression model , so that the meaning of the model and its parameters was not clear .",
    "therefore , we developed the generalized force model , which reached the best agreement with the empirical data , although it had only two parameters more than the optimal velocity model and four parameters less than the t3 model .",
    "another advantage of the generalized force model is that all its parameters are easily interpretable and have the expected order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it can be immediately said , how the parameters will differ between fast cars , slow cars , and trucks ( the latter being characterized by small @xmath43 , but large @xmath51 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "it can also be predicted what happens , if the speed limit ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) is changed , if the weather conditions are bad ( greater @xmath57 , but smaller @xmath43 and @xmath62 ) , if roads would be used by vehicles with smaller length @xmath28 , if the reaction time @xmath61 could be reduced ( by means of technical measures like an autopilot ) , etc . for these reasons ,",
    "the generalized force model is an ideal tool for carrying out detail studies of traffic flow , as well as for developing and testing traffic optimization measures .",
    "the simulation of large vehicle numbers is completely analogous to molecular - dynamic simulation studies of many - particle systems , e.g.  of granular flows .",
    "the parameters of the different driver - vehicle units are specified individually ( @xmath0-dependent ) , then . in this case",
    ", one would specify typical parameter values of fast cars , slow cars , and trucks , and their respective percentages .",
    "alternatively , one could introduce a distribution of each parameter ( e.g.  a gaussian one ) around a typical value .",
    "then , the simulation is started with the initial and boundary conditions of interest .",
    "of course , the model can be also extended to a multi - lane model with lane - changing and overtaking maneuvers @xcite .",
    "this is a topic of current research .",
    "the authors want to thank for financial support by the bmbf ( research project sandy , grant no .",
    "13n7092 ) and by the dfg ( heisenberg scholarship he 2789/1 - 1 ) .",
