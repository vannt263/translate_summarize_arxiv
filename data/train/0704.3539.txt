    "in previous works @xcite we made the nonlte modeling of the profiles of l@xmath1 and higher hydrogen lyman lines observed in euv filaments by soho / sumer on october 15 , 1999 and may 5 , 2000 .",
    "for the latter euv filament we had also observations of the h@xmath0 profiles from themis / msdp . in @xcite it was found that estimates the of temperature in the filament interior need not be reliable if there are temperatures lower than 10000k in the filament interior and rather hot ( prominence - corona transition regions ) with temperatures above 20000k at the same time .",
    "these problems occur especially for the h@xmath0 filaments .",
    "this problem can be solved by constraining the models with the profile of the h@xmath0 line that is not sensitive to the high temperature plasma of @xcite .",
    "therefore its shape represent well the temperature structure of the cool filament interior . however , the problem is to find suitable h@xmath0 observations with the same position of the slit and made at the same time , as the soho / sumer observations .",
    "the optically thick cores of the lyman lines are formed in the top pctrs while the optically thick parts of the wings are formed deeper .",
    "wavelength intervals where the profiles of l@xmath1 and higher lyman lines are optically thick , are small ( @xmath20.2or even smaller ) . outside these interval",
    "the filament is transparent .",
    "therefore the wings of these lines do not map the temperature structure of filament much deeper then the top pctr .",
    "the profile of the l@xmath0 line could be much more sensitive to the cooler hydrogen plasma deeper in the filament than higher lyman lines .",
    "its is because of the wide wavelength interval ( @xmath20.31.4  or even larger ) of the optically thick part of the profile , possibly spreading far into the wings .    in this work",
    "we are modeling profiles of the lyman lines , lyman continuum and h@xmath0 line observed in the h@xmath0 filament using the 1d - slab nonlte model @xcite . as the results of a such diagnostics we obtain the temperatures , the gas pressure , plasma densities , ionization degree etc .",
    "a filament close to the solar disk ( @xmath3=0.9 ) was observed on may 27 , 2005 ( during the 15th medoc observing campaign ) , in euv spectral lines by the cds ( coronal diagnostic spectrometer ) @xcite and sumer ( solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ) @xcite both onboard of soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) and in the h@xmath0 line by hsfa2 multicamera spectrograph at ondejov observatory .",
    "the sumer observations of the filaments and prominences during this observing campaign are unique because the l@xmath0 line was placed on the bare part of the detector a ( outside the attenuator ) for the first time during any filament / prominence observations and thus it was possible to make a reliable calibration of the observed l@xmath0 profiles .",
    "observations with cds and sumer were carried out between 17:14 and 18:07ut .",
    "cds observed the euv filament in three coronal euvlines mg624.94 , ca557.77  and mg368.07 , two transitionregion euv lines o629.73  and ne562.80and one chromospheric line he584.33 .    position of the center of cds rasters is 248 , @xmath467   ( s@xmath5 w@xmath6 in carrington coordinates ) and their dimensions are 244@xmath7240 .",
    "cds observations in the mg624.94  line are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ schfig : mgxcdsobs ] .",
    "the h@xmath0 observations were carried out with the hsfa2 multicamera spectrograph of the ondejov observatory at 7:14ut .",
    "the slitjaw coaligned with the cds observations is shown in right panel of fig .",
    "[ schfig : mgxcdsobs ] .",
    "the slit positions of hsfa2 and sumer spectrographs are crossing the filament in different directions and the times of observations of hsfa2 and soho differs .",
    "however , since the filament seemed to be rather stable and compact , the hsfa2 observations of h@xmath0 could be used as additional data in our nonlte modeling .",
    "sumer observed the euv filament in a wide wavelength range so that the whole hydrogen lyman line series is present .",
    "the spectra of lyman lines l@xmath0  l9 plus lyman continuum are shown in fig .",
    "[ schfig : sumerobs ] .",
    "we do not use the lines l10 and l11 because with a 12level model hydrogen atom our calculated populations of levels 11 and 12 are rather unprecise .",
    "position of the sumer slit during observation of the lyman series is shown in fig .",
    "[ schfig : sumerobs ] . only a part of the detector a was working therefore we obtained spectra from this part of the slit only ( marked by fullline part of vertical bar in both panels of fig .",
    "[ schfig : mgxcdsobs ] ) .",
    "this part of the slit is crossing almost only the darkest part of the euv filament  the h@xmath0 filament .",
    "a filament is approximated by the 1d horizontal isobaric slab @xcite with temperature symmetrically decreasing from pctrs to the interior .",
    "the radiative transfer is solved using mali method @xcite and a 12level model of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we used @xmath8 minimization method proposed in @xcite for fitting the observed profiles with synthetic ones . for reconstruction of lyman line profiles emitted from beneath the filament ( background irradiation )",
    "we used the method developed in @xcite  the profiles of the background irradiation are identical with profiles from the filament in the optically thin wings .",
    "the optically thick cores of l@xmath1 ",
    "l9 lines were reconstructed using the quietsun profiles published by @xcite . for l@xmath0 line",
    "the average profiles from the quietsun observations carried out on april 14 , 2005 between 13:26 and 14:26ut were used @xcite . during these observations the raster scan in the quietsun area was made and the l@xmath0 line was placed at various positions on the bare part of the detector a. there was a problem with the reconstruction of the backgroundirradiation profiles of the l@xmath0 line because the width of the wavelength interval of optically thick central part of its profile is much more sensitive to optical thickness in the line center than it is for higher lyman lines .",
    "therefore only those optically thick parts of profiles of this line were modeled which transmit no radiation from below the filament .",
    "we obtained similar plasma properties as for other two h@xmath0 filaments studied in @xcite and @xcite  temperatures around 6000k and 20000k in the filament interior and pctrs , respectively .",
    "pctrs both occupy less than 30% of the geometrical thickness of the filament , plasma densities are @xmath9 @xmath10 , electron densities around @xmath11 and the hydrogen ionization degree is lower than 0.5 in the filament interior .",
    "only the estimated gas pressure @xmath12 is about 3 times lower than that estimated for two other filaments .",
    "we compared results of our modeling when fitting profiles of the whole lyman series plus lyman continuum without h@xmath0 and results obtained with the h@xmath0 line but without l@xmath0 and found similar plasma properties in both cases .",
    "but when fitting only lyman lines without l@xmath0 the temperatures in the filament interior were underestimated . from our analysis of the dependence of the contribution function ( computed using eq .",
    "( 13 ) of @xcite ) on the geometrical depth we found that the core of the lyman lines is formed at the top of pctr , in contrast with the h@xmath0 line profile that is formed almost completely in the cool interior .",
    "however , due to large optical thickness of l@xmath0 , its near wings are formed in cool parts of the h@xmath0 filament and this helps to determine the temperature of the filament interior . using the h@xmath0 line",
    "gives a similar result .",
