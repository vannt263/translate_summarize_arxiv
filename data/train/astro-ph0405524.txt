    "recent surveys with high - resolution uv spectra have shown that mass outflow is common in seyfert 1 galaxies , appearing as blueshifted absorption in more than half of observed objects ( crenshaw et al .",
    "detailed studies are needed to determine the physical conditions ( density , ionization structure , total gas column ) and geometry of the absorbers . here",
    ", we focus on constraints derived on the absorbers in the uv spectrum of ngc 3783 to demonstrate some techniques that can be used to probe mass outflow in agns .",
    "since the background agn light that the absorption features are imprinted on is comprised of distinct emission sources with different flux distributions , sizes , and geometries , the most general treatment of absorption features should take into account the different covering factors associated with each source .",
    "the lyman series lines in the averaged stis and _ fuse _ spectra were used to separate the individual covering factors of the continuum and emission line sources in ngc 3783 ( gabel et al .",
    "2003 ) . by incorporating variability of the emission - line profiles ,",
    "that analysis can be extended to treat _ distinct emission - line regions_. figure 1 shows the c iv , ly@xmath2 , and n v emission - line profiles in both high - state ( solid line ) and low - state ( dotted line ) stis spectra .",
    "the low - state profiles have been scaled to match the flux in the high velocity wings of the high - state spectrum .",
    "the profiles diverge near line center due to the superposition of a varying broad line region component and a non - varying narrower component ( an intermediate line region , ilr ) .",
    "the ilr flux profiles ( dashed lines ) were solved as described in gabel et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the n v absorption profiles for two normalizations to demonstrate the effect of treating the covering factors of distinct emission components separately . in the left panel ,",
    "the absorption has been normalized simply by dividing the total observed spectrum by our fit to the continuum plus total emission - line flux , i.e. , the blr + ilr . in the right panel ,",
    "the ilr flux has first been subtracted out of both the data and emission - line fits , which is equivalent to assuming the ilr is completely unocculted by the absorbers . for each normalization , both the high - state ( top panel ) and low - state ( bottom panel ) spectra are plotted for comparison and the two doublet lines are overlayed , shifted to coincide in radial velocity .",
    "this shows that if the covering factors of the emission components are assumed to be the same , then the n v absorption is not saturated and has effective covering factors in the range @xmath3 0.6  0.65 for components 1  3 .",
    "the similarity in the absorption depths between the high and low - states ( for both doublet lines ) in the left panel implies there is little change in the column densities for this scenario .",
    "conversely , if the ilr is unocculted , the equivalent absorption depths of the two doublet lines indicates the absorption is saturated in both the low and high states in some of the components .",
    "this leads to significant differences in interpreting the physical conditions and variability in the absorption .",
    "the c iii * @xmath51175 multiplet lines have been used as a density diagnostic for agn absorbers in several studies . however , as pointed out by behar et al .",
    "( 2003 , apj , in press ) , the high densities derived in these studies ( e.g. , gabel et al .",
    "2003 ) were based on calculations of level populations that only treated the @xmath0p@xmath6 level .",
    "the @xmath70 and 2 levels have much lower radiative transition probabilities to the ground state and thus are populated at densities that are lower by several orders of magnitude ( bhatia & kastner 1993 ) .",
    "we have computed the relative populations of the @xmath0p@xmath8 levels , extending the results of bhatia & kastner ( 1993 ) down to electron temperatures expected for the photoionized uv absorbers seen in agns .",
    "collisional excitation and de - excitation and radiative decay between the six lowest terms / levels of the @xmath9 ion were included in our calculations .",
    "the top panel of figure 3 shows the c iii*1175 absorption complex in ngc 3783 , with the location of the six multiplet lines marked and identified by the @xmath10 level of the transition .",
    "measured column densities for each metastable level are given below the spectrum .",
    "the bottom panel shows the computed populations of the metastable levels over a large range in density for @xmath11 16000 , 20000 , and 40000 k ( bottom to top ) .",
    "thus , if the absorption is sufficiently narrow to resolve and measure individual lines in the c iii * multiplet , the _ ratios _ of the excited level populations give a very tight constraint on the electron density . for ngc 3783 , the @xmath72 : @xmath70 column density ratios , @xmath12 2.2 , gives @xmath13=3@xmath1410@xmath15  @xmath16 , which is largely insensitive to temperature .",
    "combining this with a measurement of the ground state population provides a stringent temperature diagnostic .",
    "the full implications of this measurement for the absorbers in ngc 3783 will be given in gabel et al .",
