    "many types of viruses can spontaneously assemble from the proteins that make the viral coating ( capsid ) and the viral genetic material .",
    "this was first demonstrated in the work of fraenkel - conrat and williams @xcite where they showed that fully infectious tobacco mosaic viruses can be spontaneously reconstituted from the individual proteins that make the viral coating and the viral rna molecules .",
    "it may be argued that the precision of the viral assembly is guided by an interplay between the properties of the rna / dna ( bio - polyelectrolyte ) and the capsid proteins , such as the total bio - polyelectrolyte length , the effective charge on the proteins and on the bio - polyelectrolyte , and possibly some specific interaction acting between the rna / dna and the proteins .",
    "however , in some types of viruses , the genetic material is not necessary for the capsid assembly and _ empty _ viral capsids can be assembled in the absence of viral bio - polyelectrolyte @xcite , at least when the amount of salt in the solution is large enough @xcite .",
    "it is rather intriguing that the thus assembled capsids are often highly monodisperse @xcite which suggests that there is some regulating factor , independent of the viral rna / dna , that favors capsids of particular size .",
    "this is the effect that we investigate in this article and the motivation for our study .    in principle",
    ", viral proteins can assemble in a variety of capsids with different shape and size @xcite .",
    "we shall concentrate on the nearly spherical viral capsids whose structure can be described within the so - called caspar - klug quasiequivalent construction @xcite . in more mathematical terms , the viral capsids that we consider are icosadeltahedral , i.e. they can be mapped onto triangulations of the sphere with the icosahedral  backbone  ( see e.g. refs . for more details ) .",
    "the different triangulations can be described using the notion of the so - called @xmath0-number .",
    "the number of protein subunits ( @xmath1 , which may also be protein dimers , such is e.g. the case in hepatitis b virus ) in a quasiequivalent viral capsid is @xmath2 where @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are non - negative integers @xcite .    in view of the potential polymorphism of the viral protein assemblies which is also observed experimentally , especially in some viruses @xcite , it is rather surprising that empty capsids of most simple viruses precisely assemble in capsids whose @xmath7-number is the same as in fully functional capsids that contain the viral rna / dna @xcite .",
    "even when several differently sized empty capsids do form @xcite , these represent only a tiny subset of all of the imaginable capsid formations . since the viral proteins have certain charge in the solution @xcite , it is tempting to assume that the repulsive electrostatic interactions compete with some other attractive interactions between the viral proteins in such a way that the total free energy of the capsid is minimal exactly for the capsid of the observed radius .",
    "the attractive interactions between the viral proteins could be of different origins ( e.g. van der waals interactions , hydrophobic interactions or chemical bonding ) .",
    "however , it has been experimentally demonstrated that the binding energy of the two viral proteins increases with temperature @xcite , which strongly suggests that the attractive protein interactions are dominated by either the zero - frequency term of van der waals interactions @xcite and/or by hydrophobic interactions @xcite .",
    "they should thus be rather local and proportional to the area  buried  in the protein - protein contacts .",
    "the competition between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in viral capsids has been theoretically investigated before @xcite .",
    "the emphasis there , however , was mostly on kinetics of viral assembly , i.e. on the classical nucleation theory and the mass action law .",
    "furthermore , the electrostatic interactions were modeled as the asymptotic form of the debye - hckel ( dh ) approximation , in the regime where @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the capsid radius and @xmath10 the dh screening length that is proportional to inverse square root of the salt concentration .",
    "it is the aim of this article to reexamine in more detail the role of electrostatic interactions in the capsid assembly , to investigate whether they can act to regulate the capsid size ( radius ) and whether they can prevent the capsid formation . to this end",
    ", we shall introduce a model of a viral capsid that is more realistic and more complex than the ones used in previous studies .",
    "we shall go beyond the dh approximation and consider all regimes in @xmath11 .",

    "the aim of section [ sec : model1 ] is twofold .",
    "first , we shall clearly demonstrate that the previously derived expressions for the capsid energetics @xcite have limited validity , even in physiological conditions .",

    "we first approximate the icosadeltahedral capsid as the perfect sphere of radius @xmath9 whose charge is uniformly distributed on the surface , so that the surface charge density is @xmath12 .",
    "the theory of elasticity applied to icosadeltahedral shells predicts that the viral capsids are aspherical , the more so the larger their mean radius ( this is also in agreement with experimental data ) @xcite .",
    "the asphericity arises from the so - called  buckling  of the capsid around the pentameric protein aggregates @xcite .",
    "the experimental data on virus shapes @xcite suggests that the virus surface may in fact be very corrugated , but it is difficult to assess the corrugation and asphericity of the corresponding protein charge distribution . for our purposes we neglect the capsid asphericity which is , on the basis of continuum theory of lidmar _ et al _ @xcite , expected to be small especially in viruses of small radii ( the validity of the theory may , however , be questionable for small viruses ; see sec .

    "this is of course an oversimplification of the true distribution of protein charges in the capsid .",
    "model ii does account for the essential characteristics of the capsid charge distribution , but it still does not incorporate the posible polar and azimuthal inhomogeneities of capsid charge . in that respect , it is of interest to note that the @xmath72 behavior of the free energy obtained in model i for @xmath61 is obtained , at least on the level of the dh approximation , even when one accounts for the charge inhomogeneities on the surface of the sphere that have the icosahedral symmetry of the capsid @xcite .",
    "thus , it does nt seem likely that the spatial distribution of protein charge could favor the preferred angle of protein - protein contacts .",
    "a second approximation in our models is the assumption of perfect sphericity of the viral capsid .",
    "the elasticity model of viral capsids by lidmar _",
    "et al _ @xcite suggests that larger viruses are more facetted and that their asphericity is larger .",
    "this is indeed a general trend that is observed in the experimental studied of viruses @xcite .",
    "however , the strict predictions of the theory are based on its continuum limit ( i.e. large @xmath0 numbers ) which may not hold for small viruses .",
    "nevertheless , numerical experiments with model capsid of smaller @xmath0-numbers @xcite , performed as detailed in refs . , do show that the asphericity in small viruses is again governed by the interplay of bending and stretching energies of the viral capsid and by the capsid radius .",
    "elastic properties of such small capsids that are very much different from the corresponding properties of large viral capsids would be needed to reproduce a significant asphericity in small viruses , knowing the asphericity of larger viruses where the continuum limit of the theory is expected to work fine .",
    "thus , the assumption of small asphericity in capsids of small viruses is corroborated by the discrete version of the models elaborated in refs . .",
    "this , however does not account for the corrugation of the capsid surface that is observed experimentally , especially in some viruses ( e.g. bacteriophage p4 , see ref . ) .",
    "this effect is related to the spatial distribution of the protein mass and charge , and , as elaborated in the previous paragraph , is neglected in our model .",
    "in summary , we find that electrostatic interactions make important ( repulsive ) contribution to the energetics empty capsid binding of several hundreds of @xmath93 , depending strongly on the salt concentration . in highly salty solutions , the electrostatic interactions are efficiently screened resulting in a larger binding energy of the capsids , in accordance with what was experimentally found for hepatitis b virus @xcite .",
    "the results of our exact numerical studies compare favorably with limiting expressions derived previously in the debye - hckel approximation and valid for sufficiently large salt concentrations @xcite .",
    "the regimes in which these approximations severely fail have been identified . since the electrostatic energies of viral capsids scale with the second power of capsid radius , in the regime of radii typical for viruses",
    ", we find that simple , curvature independent expressions for the adhesive , attractive interaction , such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : adhesimp ] ) , can not explain the monodispersity of self - assembled empty viral capsids and that certain angle - dependent interaction acting between the neighboring protein subunits is needed in that respect .",
    "our study also explains that if the empty viral structure that is formed spontaneously has the same symmetry as fully infectious virus ( containing the genetic material / polyelectrolyte ) then the pressure that acts on the viral capsid arises from the polyelectrolyte self - interaction , and the attractive interaction between the polyelectrolyte and the viral capsid , _",
    "i.e. _ the capsid electrostatic self - repulsion is exactly counteracted by the curvature dependent adhesion energy .",

    "the potential in the interior of the capsid can in the dh approximation be written as @xmath115 in the capsid material , the potential is @xmath116 and outside the capsid @xmath117 two equations for four unknown coefficients , @xmath118,@xmath119,@xmath120 and @xmath121 are obtained from the requirement of the continuity of potential at @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
