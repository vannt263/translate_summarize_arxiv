    "the solar dynamics observatory is scheduled to launch from cape canaveral in september 2008 on an atlas v booster .",
    "onboard this satellite there will be several instruments dedicated to the study of the solar photospheric and coronal magnetic fields and their relation to the interplanetary medium , space weather and terrestrial climatology .",
    "the helioseismic and magnetic imager is an instrument developed by a collaboration between stanford university , lockheed - martin solar and astrophysics laboratory and the high altitude observatory .",
    "hmi consists of a combination of a lyot filter and two michelson interferometers that will measure the full stokes vector @xmath0 at several wavelengths across the fe i 6173.3   line .",
    "hmi will have twin ccd cameras that will operate independently .",
    "the first one , to be referred to as the `` doppler camera '' , will be devoted to the measurement of the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field and velocity , like mdi on soho .",
    "the second camera , hereafter referred to as the `` vector camera '' , will measure the vector magnetic field and line - of - sight velocities .",
    "each ccd consists of a 4096 @xmath1 4096 pixel array with a pixel size of 0.5 arcsec .",
    "together with sdo s geosynchronous orbit , this will allow for a near continuous monitoring of the solar ( full disk ) vector magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we study the accuracy to which we can retrieve the magnetic field vector and other physical parameters of the solar photosphere using the data from the hmi vector camera .",
    "details about how the vector camera records the data are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we describe the main sources of uncertainty in the data ( photon noise , limited spectral resolution , solar oscillatory modes ) and how we simulate hmi data by taking into account those effects .",
    "once we account for those processes , we are able to use a stokes synthesis code to compute polarization profiles of the fe i 6173.3   line as if they were observed by hmi .",
    "a large database of profiles is built by using an array of atmospheric parameters . using a stokes inversion code ( described in section 4 ) the physical parameters used in the synthesis",
    "can be recovered .",
    "the errors in the retrieval depending upon the choice of the polarization modulation are studied in section 5 .",
    "the effects of the photon noise are considered in section 6 .",
    "section 7 investigates the improvement in the retrieval when the data are averaged in time .",
    "our conclusions are finally given in section 8 .",

    "this spectral line was chosen after a careful comparison with other candidates : ni i 6767.8 and fe i 6302.5 ( see norton _",
    "et al_. 2006 ) .",
    "this line possesses a land factor of g@xmath22.5 and therefore is more suitable for the investigation of the magnetic field than its mdi counterpart ni i ( g@xmath21.5 ) 6767.8    ( see scherrer _ et al_. 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , its large slope in the wings ensures a high accuracy in the derived velocity signals ( see cabrera solana , bellot rubio , and del toro iniesta , 2005 ) .",
    "it is also relatively free of blends which makes this line very convenient for hmi purposes , since the geosynchronous orbit of sdo will induce doppler shifts as large as @xmath3 km s@xmath4 due to spacecraft velocities .",
    "[ [ filter - profiles ] ] filter profiles : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the combined lyot - michelson filter system in hmi produces a transmission profile with a fwhm of 76 m . tuning positions",
    "are separated by 69 m .",
    "although there are a number of different configurations and possible tuning positions available , in this work , we will restrict ourselves to studying a configuration in which the spectral line is scanned across five wavelength positions with the middle one located at the central laboratory wavelength @xmath5 of the spectral line .",
    "figure 1 displays the filter profiles at each wavelength position . in the remainder of the paper",

    "@xmath18 is therefore a @xmath20 matrix . before shifting to the next tuning position ( @xmath21 )",
    ", hmi will measure the next linear combination of stokes profiles , as given by the modulation matrix , at the same wavelength :    @xmath22    once this is done the wavelength position is shifted to @xmath21 and the process for @xmath23 is repeated until @xmath24 .",
    "the observation sequence continues by changing equations ( 1)(2 ) to @xmath25 and so forth until the last scan is made with @xmath26 . throughout this process",

    "an example of the intensity profile for the line fe i 6173.3   is given in solid.,width=377 ]    in order to obtain the observed stokes vector at each wavelength position , one must first demodulate the vector @xmath33 from equation ( 1 ) .    @xmath34    or equivalently , as follows .    @xmath35    note that both the vector @xmath33 and the observed stokes vector @xmath36 ( or any of its @xmath37 components ) are gathered over 4@xmath38 seconds since each element @xmath39 was acquired at a different time @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , what is observed by hmi is some sort of temporal average of the solar stokes vector .    a number of possible filter sequences and polarization modulations have been suggested . in this work",
    "we will restrict ourselves to consider only three of them in wavelength with a cadence of 50 seconds or better .",
    "for the vector camera it would have been more desirable to measure all of polarization states at each tuning position ( @xmath8 ) before shifting to the next wavelength .",
    "however , this would require too many motor rotations between observations which may risk mechanical failure . ] .",
    "they will be referred to as : modulations a , b or c. sample framelists for them are given in tables  i , ii , and iii . referring to those tables and equation ( 1 ) it is possible to construct the modulation matrices @xmath18 corresponding to modulation schemes a , b , and c.    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    it is important to mention that modulations a and b require 80 seconds to record the full stokes vector at all tuning positions , while modulation c needs 120 seconds . a and b demodulate according to equations ( 4)(5 )",
    "since @xmath18 is a 4@xmath14 square matrix ( see equations ( 6)(7 ) ) and its inverse is calculated easily . on the contrary",
    ", modulation scheme c requires some other consideration since @xmath43 ( equation ( 8) ) is not square .",
    "this is due to the fact that modulation c gathers more information than actually needed . in particular , stokes @xmath44 is obtained three times . for simplicity",

    "time is in units of @xmath51 four seconds .",
    "@xmath52 is determined by ccd readout time , the time needed to select a polarization state and to shift the filter position .",

    "the hmi instrument intends to provide accurate and continuous full - disk measurements of the solar magnetic field vector in the photosphere .",
    "we have identified and carefully studied the main sources of errors in hmi : limited spectral resolution , solar _",
    "p _ modes ( that affect our data as a consequence of the non - simultaneity in the polarization measurements ) and photon noise",
    ". the most critical source of error turns out to be the photon noise . increasing the signal - to - noise ratio of the observations",
    "is achieved with longer integration times .",
    "this is not trivial .",
    "increasing the exposure time per measurement may lead to saturation effects as we reach the limits of the ccd s linear behavior .",
    "the only possibility left is to combine several measurements .",
    "we find that averaging data over ten minutes increases the signal - to - noise by a factor of two to three ( see table  vi ) plus effectively removes the effect of the solar _ p _ modes .",
    "this leads to very precise determinations of the time - averaged magnetic field vector , with an accuracy better than five gauss in field strength and 0.2 degrees in inclination and azimuth .",
    "a faster and better correction for the _ p _ modes can be achieved in different ways . on the one hand",
    ", the observations can be averaged over time using more sophisticated methods . in section 7",
    "a simple ( unweighted ) average was used .",
    "more sophisticated ways ( _ e.g. _ : using appropriate weights ) would lead to a faster smearing of the solar _ p _ modes . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to interpolate the data so that we combine polarization measurements taken at the same time ( see equation ( 14 ) ) .",
    "this might correct the effects of the solar _ p _ modes even without time averaging .",
    "a last possibility would be to apply a subsonic filter to the raw ( _ i.e. _ : monochormatic and not demodulated ) data ( rutten , wijn , and stterlin , 2004 ) .",
    "although these possibilities are worth investigating , they will not significantly change our results since the main source of errors is the photon noise .    a critical point",
    "we have not mentioned concerns the contribution of the non - magnetic atmosphere @xmath54 ( see equation ( 10 ) ) . in all our simulations",
    "we have considered @xmath54 as known ( with the exception of the filling factor @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is a best case scenario . in reality",
    ", the @xmath54 contribution can arise because of scattered light from the optical elements of the instrument , or due to the presence of a real non - magnetic atmospheric component within the resolution element of the observations .    in the first case ( instrumental scattered light )",
    ", it might be possible to characterize @xmath54 with laboratory tests .",
    "in the second case , its origin would be solar , and therefore we should have considered new free parameters in our inversion to describe @xmath54 , such as : @xmath56 .",
    "we have neglected this in order to keep the number of free parameters ( listed in table  iv ) within reasonable limits and below the number of data points ( 20 ) .",
    "a necessary extension of this work should address this point carefully by both _ ( a ) _ including the new free parameters and , _",
    "( b ) _ by using a different @xmath54 in the synthesis and the inversion so that we can quantify the errors introduced by a poorly known @xmath54 .",
    "obviously the larger @xmath55 , the smaller these errors will be .",
    "therefore , for sunspot regions ( figure 10 and tables  vii and viii ) the results presented in this work should be robust .",
    "another very important issue concerns the speed of the inversion process ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the employed method is a traditional non - linear least - squares fitting algorithm .",
    "this method will not ultimately be used for the inversion of hmi data .",
    "our simulations with the analysis of 20 000 profiles took an average of 24 hours to complete .",
    "hmi requires the processing of millions of profiles per minute .",
    "even those methods , considered to be fast , such as principal component analysis ( rees _ et al . _ , 2000 ) or artificial neural networks ( socas - navarro , 2003 ) , will be challenged by hmi requirements",
    ". this will be the subject of a future investigation .",
