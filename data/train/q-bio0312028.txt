    "classical and over - simplified models of the cell reduces the membrane to a bilayer of lipids in a fluid state which is a solvent for the proteins of the membrane @xcite .",
    "but the cell membrane is a much more complex and inhomogeneous system .",
    "the inhomogeneities come from a phase separation between small structures called rafts @xcite and the surrounding liquid phase .",
    "these rafts have been discovered a decade ago and remain an important issue of cell biology but also immunology , virology , etc @xcite .",
    "a lot of biological studies concern the rafts and examine their composition @xcite , their in - vivo size @xcite , their role in signaling @xcite or in lipid traffic @xcite for example .",
    "the raft is roughly a mixture of cholesterol and sphingolipid but the exact nature of the sphingolipid and its concentration can vary between different rafts . in any case and whatever its composition , the raft has different physical or chemical properties than the rest of the membrane . in this paper , we focus on this specificity which is at the origin of an elastic instability that we want to explain .",
    "experimentally , the raft in vivo can not be easily studied and artificial systems like guv ( giant unilamellar vesicle ) @xcite appear more appropriate .",
    "guv consist in a membrane of lipids with the possibility of a raft inclusion . on these artificial systems ,",
    "a better control of the experimental parameters can be obtained and explored .",
    "for example , they have been used to study the coupled effects of both the membrane composition and the temperature on the nucleation of rafts @xcite .",
    "recently , a new experiment on guv with rafts has shown a spectacular budding process @xcite induced by injection of proteins called @xmath0 ( phospholipase @xmath1 ) . before injection ,",
    "the guv membrane is in a stable , nearly spherical state .",
    "but , more precisely , high - quality pictures of vesicles reveal two spherical caps , one for each phase : the raft and the fluid phase @xcite .",
    "these two caps have a radius of the same order of magnitude ( about 5 micrometers , depending on the experimental conditions ) and are separated by a discontinuous interface .",
    "few seconds after injection of @xmath0 with a micro - pipette in the vicinity of the raft , one observes a rather strong destabilization of the initial shape : the raft tries to rise .",
    "the discontinuity of slope at the interface between the two caps becomes more and more pronounced .",
    "this lifting can be strong enough to expel the raft from the vesicle . when two or three rafts are present initially , successive expulsions can be observed .",
    "we present here a theoretical treatment showing that the driving force of the deformation is the absorption of proteins which locally deforms the membrane .",
    "we neglect chemical reactions since we focus here on the early stages of the instability : the time - scale of the instability is small compared to the characteristic time of chemical effects .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest model relevant for the experiment we want to describe .",
    "it involves standard physical concepts of membrane mechanics .",
    "the initial shape of the system is given by a minimum of the energy of the whole system ( that is the inhomogeneous vesicle including proteins ) .",
    "a linear perturbation treatment allows to examine the existence of another solution which may lead to a new minimum of energy .",
    "this approach is sufficient to predict the experimental observation of destabilization and to derive a concentration threshold for an elastic instability of the vesicle .",
    "the calculation presented in this paper concerns only the first stages of the instability .",
    "intermediate stages require at least a dynamical nonlinear calculation including possible chemical effects of proteins .",
    "the final stage can be achieved by a non - linear calculation or , in case of fission , by the energy evaluation of two separated homogeneous spheres following the strategy described in @xcite .",
    "models of vesicles have been widely described in previous papers @xcite .",
    "they vary depending on the physical interactions involved taken into account .",
    "the backbone of all models is based on the minimization of the average curvature energy of the bilayer , with the introduction of a possible local membrane asymmetry @xcite .",
    "a large number of shapes have been predicted in the past by this model @xcite .",
    "they suitably describe experimental results such as the various shapes of red blood cells .",
    "other physical effects can be introduced , such as the difference of area between the two layers of the membrane @xcite , suggesting a differential compressive stress in the bilayer .",
    "these effects are visible under suitable experimental conditions @xcite . here",
    ", our scope is to study quantitatively the protein - membrane interaction using a generalization of the leibler s model @xcite to an inhomogeneous system .",
    "it turns out that this model , which describes the proteins as defects on the membrane , leads to a spatially inhomogeneous spontaneous curvature which is shown to be responsible for the destabilization of the whole system .",
    "going back to the microscopic level , we derive a threshold for the protein concentration , which appears as a control parameter .",
    "moreover , depending on the shape of the proteins , we are able to select two different regimes : a protein - stocking regime and a destabilization regime with possible raft - ejection .",
    "the idea of a non - homogeneous spontaneous curvature is not new since it has been used for mono - phasic vesicles to explain a possible thermal budding @xcite .",
    "this does not concern the experiment described in @xcite since the temperature is not the relevant control parameter .",
    "another scenario for the budding process of a raft has been proposed by @xcite : the increase of line tension by the proteins leads to an apparent slope discontinuity and to a neck .",
    "again , this approach , which is different from ours , is not quantitatively related to the amount of proteins .",
    "it is why we suggest a different treatment as an interpretation of the raft ejection .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a detailed description of the model defining precisely the elastic energy plus the energy of interaction combined to the constraints .",
    "section 3 determines an obvious solution of the minimization of energy in terms of two joined spherical caps .",
    "a linear perturbation is performed which gives the threshold of proteins when a destabilization occurs . in section 4 ,",
    "the results are analyzed and discussed taking into account known or estimated orders of magnitude of physical parameters .",
    "the energetic model of the membrane is well established nowadays .",
    "it can incorporate many different interactions , constraints or restrictions . here , we focus on a precise experiment and we think the model suitable for this experiment @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it can be modified easily for another experimental set - up .",
    "we consider a slightly stretched vesicle made of amphiphilic molecules difficult to solubilize in water .",
    "the raft will be denoted by phase @xmath2 , it is usually considered as an ordered liquid .",
    "the remaining part is denoted by phase @xmath3 and is considered as a disordered liquid . as the two phases are liquid , we describe them by two similar free energies , each of them having its own set of physical constants .",
    "quantities which remain fixed in the experiment are constraints expressed via lagrange multipliers in the free energy .",
    "so we define the energy of the bilayer in the phase @xmath4 : @xmath5ds}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 the mean curvature and @xmath7 the gaussian curvature .",
    "the square of @xmath6 is the classical elastic energy @xcite when we get rid of the spontaneous curvature . here",
    ", there is no physical reason to introduce a spontaneous curvature , sign of asymmetry between the two layers .",
    "the membrane contains enough cholesterol , which has a fast rate of flip - flop and which relaxes the constraints inside the bilayer . as for the gaussian curvature ,",
    "when a bi - phasic system without topological changes is concerned , it gives ( gauss - bonnet theorem ) a mathematical contribution only at the boundary @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 means the surface tension : it is the combination between the stretching energy of the membrane and an entropic effect due to invisible fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in addition to this energy of the bare membrane , we need to introduce the protein - membrane interactions .",
    "both phases absorb the proteins , as soon as they are introduced , but probably with a different affinity .",
    "these proteins are not soluble in water , so we think that they remain localized on the membrane and neglect possible exchange with the surrounding bath . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of these molecules remains constant .",
    "moreover , we assume that the proteins can not cross the interface @xcite . as suggested by s. leibler @xcite , the average curvature",
    "is coupled to the protein concentration , for two possible reasons .",
    "first , this can be due to the conical shape of the proteins which locally make a deformation of the membrane .",
    "second , an osmotic pressure on the membrane results from the part of the protein in the water @xcite .",
    "whatever the microscopic effect , the proteins force the membrane to tilt nearby and thus induce a local curvature .",
    "we define the energy due to proteins in the phase @xmath4 : @xmath9 ds}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 the concentration of proteins on the surface .",
    "the coupling constant is @xmath11 . in eq.([fpi ] ) , @xmath12 is a lagrange multiplier which allows to maintain the number of proteins constant in each phase .",
    "the model can be easily changed by considering @xmath13 as the chemical potential of the proteins . in this case , the proteins are free to move everywhere on the membrane , to cross the interfaces or to go in the surrounding water .",
    "the last term in eq.([fpi ] ) is a landau s expansion of the energy needed to absorb proteins on the surface nearby the equilibrium concentration @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath10 gradient indicates a cost in energy to pay for a spatially inhomogeneous concentration .",
    "since the two phases are coupled together to make a unique membrane , let us describe now the interaction between them .",
    "the total energy of this inhomogeneous system is the sum of these two individual energies for each phase plus at least two coupling terms .",
    "first , a more or less sharp interface exists between the raft and the phospholipidic part of the membrane .",
    "the interface is a line , the cost of energy of the transition being given by a line tension @xmath15 equivalent to the surface tension in a vapor - liquid mixing .",
    "second , the surface of the vesicle is lightly porous to the water but not to the ions or big molecules present in the solution .",
    "so , the membrane is a semi - permeable surface and an osmotic pressure appears .",
    "as a small variation of the composition of the medium surrounding the vesicle induces a large variation of the size of the vesicle , the volume does not change when the proteins are injected , however the membrane will break down or transient pores will appear @xcite , which is not observed here .",
    "so , one needs to introduce a lagrange s parameter @xmath16 to express the constraint on the volume .",
    "physically , @xmath17 is the difference of osmotic pressure between the two sides of the membrane .",
    "then , the free energy of the bilayer becomes : @xmath18 with @xmath19 the boundary between the two phases .",
    "a variational approach is used to find the initial state and to study its stability to small perturbations .",
    "first , we look for the simplest realistic solution with an homogeneous concentration of proteins in each phase . it can be found by minimizing the energy  @xmath20 .",
    "this minimization gives the euler - lagrange equations ( e - l equations ) plus the boundary conditions in an arbitrary set of coordinates .",
    "the surface has initially an axis of symmetry .",

    "second , when @xmath41 goes to infinity , we recover the result for an homogeneous flat membrane @xcite .",
    "notice that , in eq.([seuil ] ) , the protein concentration has a similar significance as a negative surface tension : one can make the change of variable @xmath69 .",
    "the principal effect of the proteins is to decrease the surface tension which is an obvious sign of instability .",
    "we will use the protein concentration @xmath43 as our control parameter .",

    "the threshold concentration @xmath70 strongly depends on the physical properties of each phase .",
    "then , the two parts of the initial system have no reason to be unstable simultaneously .",
    "the deformation of the other phase ( not unstable to linear order ) will be induced by the non - linear effects not included in this analysis .",
    "since the thermal energy @xmath73 is the only external energy and the typical length of the phase ( i ) is @xmath41 , one can introduce dimensionless parameters : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 a characteristic length for the gradient of protein concentration .",
    "then , the protein concentration is replaced by @xmath81 which is proportional to the square of the number of proteins in the phase ( i ) .    rewriting the threshold ( [ seuil ] )",
    ", we find for the threshold concentration , in dimensionless parameters : @xmath82 from eq.([phi_l2 ] ) , the search of the smallest threshold concentration gives two different regimes depending on the value of the dimensionless constant : @xmath83 this constant describes the strength of the coupling of the protein with the membrane ( @xmath11 ) to the resistance of the membrane ( @xmath84 ) and to the absorption power ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "for two different values of ( [ phi_l2 ] ) are taken as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",

    "so , the threshold is obtained for the smallest possible @xmath54 : @xmath94 .",
    "the direction of the deformation ( inside or outside the initial cap ) would be deduced from a third order calculation or from a numerical simulation . according to the definition of @xmath95 ( eq.([capi ] ) ) , the concentration required to destabilize the membrane is found bigger than the equilibrium concentration .",
    "but in this case , one expects that this threshold @xmath70 is difficult or impossible to reach since it requests the absorption of a concentration of proteins larger than @xmath96 : probably , the excess of proteins would prefer to dissolve in the surrounding water then forming aggregates .",
    "so , the weak regime of instability is not observable experimentally , our basic state made of two spherical caps is stable and proteins are stocked only .    in the strong interaction regime , the limiting concentration shows a minimum not necessary for the smallest @xmath54 ( see fig.[courbe ] ) .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , the limiting concentration is less than the equilibrium concentration and it is easier to induce the instability .",
    "second , the first unstable mode could be modified : @xmath97 for the chosen numerical values .",
    "so , we have something more complex than the simple oblate / prolate ( @xmath94 ) deformation .",
    "this regime is observable and probably corresponds to the observed shape instability . in any case",
    ", our basic state can not be seen in the experiment except as a transient .",
    "the existence of these two regimes , depending on the nature of the proteins , allows two possible and distinct scenarios for the cell : there is no doubt that this property is useful and probably used for biological purpose .",
    "the main difficulty of this study is the quantitative determination of the parameters since experimental values are not available even for this minimal model .",
    "let us estimate @xmath98 .",
    "the curvature of the membrane is of order @xmath99 , its surface is close to @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 is of order @xmath102 for an unstretched vesicle , so @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 , the cost of energy needed to increase the concentration of proteins , can be deduced from the energy required to remove a protein from the surface which is is about @xmath105 .",
    "it changes the concentration of proteins of @xmath106 so @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 is deduced from @xmath80 which should be a small fraction of the radius of the sphere .",
    "we will take hereafter @xmath110 .",
    "the proteins are moving at the surface of the membrane due to the brownian motion .",
    "so the energy to move one protein by the length @xmath80 is about @xmath73 .",
    "then , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is more difficult to determine .",
    "@xmath11 is the coupling constant between the membrane and the proteins .",
    "this is expressed by the spontaneous curvature radius @xmath113 . if @xmath113 is small , the coupling effect is strong and , on the opposite , if @xmath113 is large , @xmath11 is small , which suggests that @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath114 . but",
    "@xmath11 is an energy multiplied by a length .",
    "then , a good order of magnitude for @xmath11 is @xmath115 , so @xmath116 . finally , we get @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath113 is smaller than @xmath41 , the system is in the strong coupling regime and in the other case , the interaction between membrane and proteins is weak . when the two phases have approximately the same physical constants @xcite , the instability occurs first in the largest phase , as shown by eq.([phi_l2 ] ) in the previous conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the ejection of one part of the membrane requires a complete nonlinear dynamical treatment which will be derived from this energy formulation .",
    "we have proposed a model of instability for an inhomogeneous vesicle which absorbs proteins .",
    "this instability is at the origin of a separation into two vesicles , one for each phase as seen experimentally .",
    "our model rests on a `` bulk '' effect and assumes that the proteins are distributed everywhere on the membrane contrary to the `` line tension ' ' model which assumes a high concentration of the proteins at the raft boundary . to validate ( or invalidate ) our model ,",
    "an experimental test could be the use of phosphorescent proteins with the same properties",
    ". it would be a way to follow the place where the proteins prefer to diffuse and stay on the membrane .",
    "although we ignore the feasibility of such an experiment , it would provide a very useful information .",
    "we thank g. staneva , m. angelova and k. koumanov for communicating their results prior to publication .",
    "we acknowledge enlightening discussions with j.b . fournier .",
    "the spherical cap harmonics are eigenvalues of the laplace s equation in spherical coordinates .",
    "the laplace s problem can then be rewritten as a legendre s equation .",
