    "these kinds of systems exhibit many interesting non - equilibrium phenomena , as discussed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite    there are basically two kinds of models which have been developed to study these systems : in the extended island model , the islands occupy more than one site on the lattice , and their shape is not trivial @xcite . in the simpler point - island model ,",
    "the islands just occupied one site in the lattice , and their size is simply the number of monomers which belong to the island @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the point - island model , which is very accurate for low coverages .",
    "a major advantage of this simplification is that it produces better statistics than the extended island model .    in our model only the monomers are mobile , the islands formed by two or more monomers are completely static ( stable ) . in the literature",

    "monomers must land or hop onto an already occupied site in order to be incorporated @xcite ; in an alternative model features incorporation of monomers arriving at sites adjacent to the island @xcite .",
    "the quantities that are commonly used to describe the evolution of the point - island model are the density of monomers , @xmath5 ; the density of islands with size @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; the rate of deposition of monomers , @xmath8 ; and the diffusion rate of monomers @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of this system is frequently described in terms of the coverage @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the time .",
    "we restrict our studies to the aggregation regime , where there is a quasi steady - state .",
    "we are particularly interested in the spacing ( gap ) distribution functions between islands @xmath12 , the capture zone distribution @xmath13 , and the island - island pair correlation function @xmath14 . as usual , @xmath15 is the probability that for an island at the origin we find another island at a distance between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with the condition that there are @xmath18 additional islands inside the gap between them .",

    "in the 1d case , we have a ring divided into independent sections called gaps .",
    "each gap starts and ends with an island . within the gaps",
    ", there may be several monomers performing random walks .",
    "a monomer inside of a particular gap must eventually either merge with one of the islands at the ends of the gap or combine with another monomer to nucleate a new island . in no case",
