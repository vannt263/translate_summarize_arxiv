    "the lightest scalar meson , presently listed by the pdg@xcite under the name @xmath7 , known as the sigma meson , is a subject of long lasting debates . on the conservative side ,",
    "the notion of the @xmath3 meson simply refers to the well established fact that the @xmath0 scattering phase @xmath8 in the @xmath9 channel strongly rises between the @xmath0 threshold and the @xmath10 region ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "brave people speak about positions of the @xmath3 pole(s ) of the s - matrix ; however , they have differing opinions about the dynamical origin of this pole . in this paper",
    "we try to elucidate the nature of the lowest scalar  isoscalar states .",
    "the dynamical origin of the @xmath3 meson is discussed in sec.[secsigma ] , the interplay of different scalar ",
    "isoscalar states is considered in sec.[secccm ] , and conclusions are summarized in sec.[secconcl ] .",
    ".[tabsigma ] the poles of the @xmath5-matrix in the @xmath11-plane ( gev ) corresponding to the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the errors , when available , are shown in parentheses . in case when several solutions are found , the average value and spread are given . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can incorporate the most significant elements of all these models in a relatively simple framework of the @xmath3 meson generation .",
    "this includes : the s - matrix unitarity , the constraints following from chiral symmetry , and the explicit manifestation of the closest dynamical singularities .",
    "to combine all these basic features together we use the n / d method and describe the @xmath5-wave scattering amplitude by @xmath12 here the factor @xmath13 is due to chiral symmetry ( @xmath14 is the adler zero@xcite ) , the function @xmath15 is analytical in the physical region and has only the left  hand ( dynamical ) cut , and the function @xmath16 has only the right  hand ( kinematical ) cut as required by unitarity . given the discontinuity of the amplitude across the left ",
    "hand cut , the system of integral equations for the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 is obtained in the standard way . for the discontinuity of the amplitude on the left hand cut ,",
    "we take the _ closest _ dynamical singularity corresponding to the born approximation for the @xmath17 meson @xmath18 and @xmath19channel exchanges to @xmath20 .",
    "the discontinuity function is cut off for @xmath21 to avoid otherwise needed subtractions .",
    "the cutoff position @xmath22 is determined from the requirement that the @xmath0 scattering length @xmath23 corresponds to the physical value of the @xmath24 coupling constant @xmath25 ( the value of @xmath22 turns out to be close to the dynamical threshold at @xmath26 corresponding to the second order @xmath17exchange term ) . ] : @xmath27     +   +    figure [ figsigma]a shows the trajectories of the @xmath3 pole for variable strength of the @xmath0 interaction . as the @xmath28 coupling constant increases from zero to the physical value , a pair of poles corresponding to the @xmath3 meson emerges from the dynamical cut and moves on the second sheet of the complex energy plane . for the scattering length @xmath23",
    "the pole position in the energy plane is @xmath29gev , in a good agreement with the more elaborated models listed in  tab .",
    "[ tabsigma ] . with further increase of @xmath28 ,",
    "the poles collide at the adler zero and then move along the imaginary @xmath30-axis - wave where the poles collide at threshold , with the threshold position replacing @xmath31 in ( [ eqnd ] ) . ] .    from this example",
    ", we can draw a more general conclusion by using the fact that the limit @xmath32 corresponds to the qcd limit of large number of colors , @xmath2 .",
    "while the masses of the @xmath4 mesons remain finite and their widths become infinitely small at @xmath2 , the @xmath3 meson completely vanishes in this limit . in other words",
    ", the @xmath3 meson corresponds to a dynamical pole of the s - matrix and , thus , it is fundamentally different from the conventional @xmath4 states ( like @xmath33 and @xmath17 ) which correspond to the cdd poles@xcite .",
    "the relation of the @xmath3 meson to the @xmath0 attractive interaction generated by the @xmath17exchange , has been discussed in the literature @xcite . using the k - matrix unitarization of the born approximation ,",
    "as suggested in @xcite , we obtain the @xmath3 meson trajectory shown in fig.[figsigma]b .",
    "this simple approximation , the trajectories do not return to the imaginary @xmath30 axis .",
    "] produces fairly reasonable results up to the physical value of @xmath28 and clearly demonstrates the importance of the left hand cut in the dynamical generation of the s - matrix poles .",
    "turning to the chiral perturbation theory and using the one  loop single channel approximation unitarized as in ref.@xcite , we obtain the @xmath3 trajectory shown in fig.[figsigma]c . for increasing strength of the @xmath0 interaction ,",
    "the pole trajectories behave similar to the case in fig.[figsigma]a because both models satisfy the same constraints imposed by the chiral symmetry ( they have the same adler zero ) . however , the chpt trajectories go to infinity when the interaction strength goes to zero ( the pion decay constant @xmath34 ) . comparing the different cases shown in fig.[figsigma ]",
    "one can conclude that the role of the left hand cuts in the chpt framework must be further investigated .",
    "it is known@xcite that the @xmath17-meson exchange term receives a strong cancellation in the leading order of the chpt expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "the discontinuity of the @xmath17 exchange amplitude across the left hand cut is sufficient for generating poles in the complex plane . while the pad approximation of the chpt series can easily produce the @xmath3 pole , it is more difficult to reconstruct the left hand cut in this approach .",
    "the simplified version of the chpt in fig.[figsigma]c just puts all other singularities ( including the left hand cut ) to infinity .",
    "it is rather plausible that , if proper dynamical cuts are taken into account , the @xmath3 trajectories will originate from the left hand cut rather than from infinity .",
    "a similar situation seems to occur in the multichannel k - matrix fits based on multiresonance approximation ( table [ tabsigma ] ) where no dynamical cuts are taken into consideration and the total number of s - matrix poles does not depend on the coupling constants . while these models can provide good fits@xcite of the experimental data in the physical region ,",
    "the lack of theoretical information related to the left hand cut apparently distorts the nature of the @xmath3 origin .",
    "in this situation , the rising scattering phase in the @xmath3 region is built up by heavier resonances .",
    "another important aspect of the @xmath3 meson dynamics is its interplay with further @xmath36 states involving the @xmath10 , the @xmath4 states , and the scalar glueball . here",
    "we exploit an exactly solvable coupled channel model@xcite to address some of these questions .",
    "the following interactions are included in this model : a separable diagonal @xmath37 potential producing a weakly bound state , a separable transition potential @xmath38 ( representing @xmath39-exchange , e.g. ) which couples the @xmath0 and @xmath37 channels , and broad resonances in the @xmath4 channel which represent background and are coupled to the @xmath0 and @xmath37 channels .",
    "the chiral symmetry constraints are imposed on the model parameters , so that the adler zero is always located at the right position .",
    "the model parameters have been determined from the fit of the @xmath0 and @xmath37 scattering data , see ref.@xcite for details .",
    "this model allows one to study the appearance of dynamical coupled channel poles in the case of physical parameters , where the number of poles close to the physical region exceeds the number of the bare states .",
    "the interpretation of the singularities , including the important role of the dynamical ones , is elucidated by studying the trajectories of the @xmath5-matrix poles as a function of the strength of the channel couplings .",
    "+   +    figure [ figtrajs ] shows two typical cases of the trajectories of the s - matrix poles in the complex plane @xmath40 , the couplings between the channels having been varied between zero and their physical values . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath3 meson is generated dynamically on the second sheet of the complex energy plane by the strong coupling @xmath41 resulting in an effective attractive interaction in the @xmath0 channel below the @xmath4 state .",
    "the singularity of the form factor in the @xmath42 vertex plays the same role as the left hand cut in the discussion in sec.2 .",
    "thus the situation in the vicinity of the @xmath0 threshold is similar to that of the single channel approximation discussed above .",
    "the situation for the @xmath10 near the @xmath37 threshold is much richer : there are two different possibilities shown in figs.[figtrajs]a , b . in case ( a )",
    ", the physical pole on the sheet ii corresponding to the @xmath10 originates directly from the weakly bound @xmath37 state , and the @xmath43 state on the sheet ii develops a large imaginary part . in case",
    "( b ) , the pole originating from the @xmath43 state is attracted to the @xmath37 threshold and corresponds to the narrow @xmath10 state .",
    "it can be demonstrated using the probability sum rules@xcite that in the latter case we have rearrangement of the spectrum where the initial @xmath4 state turns into a molecular @xmath37 state with a small admixture of the original @xmath4 component .",
    "figure [ figtrajs ] also demonstrates that in both cases there are two poles close to @xmath37 threshold ( on the sheets ii and iii ) in agreement with many fits to the data .",
    "this result does not contradict the @xmath37 molecular origin of the @xmath10 because the conventional wisdom of having only one pole near threshold for a molecular state is based on perturbation theory and does not apply to the strong coupling case .",
    "the additional pole originates from the @xmath4 bare state and moves close to the @xmath37 threshold due to the strong attraction in the @xmath37 channel while the @xmath4 component dissolves in the continuum producing a broad resonance .",
    "our results lead to the following picture of the lowest scalar ",
    "isoscalar mesons .",
    "the lightest state is the broad @xmath3 meson which corresponds to the s - matrix pole at @xmath44gev .",
    "this pole has a dynamical origin : it is produced by the attractive interaction in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the @xmath3 meson is fundamentally different from the @xmath4 resonances , in particular , it vanishes in the limit @xmath2 where the @xmath4 resonances turn into narrow states .    the second state is the @xmath10 near the @xmath37 threshold .",
    "it corresponds to two s - matrix poles on the sheets ii and iii in the two - channel case ( there will be more poles if extra channels are added to the @xmath0 and @xmath37 channels ) .",
    "this state is also of dynamical nature because it originates from a @xmath37 molecular state embedded in the @xmath0 continuum .",
    "this state vanishes in the limit @xmath2 when the @xmath37 interaction becomes weak .",
    "therefore , the @xmath45 states are expected in the mass region @xmath46gev where several @xmath1 resonances have been found@xcite .",
    "it is rather gratifying to have the two lowest states accommodated beyond the @xmath4 family because otherwise there would appear to be too many candidates to be identified with the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the scalar glueball states ( or the corresponding mixtures of them ) .",
