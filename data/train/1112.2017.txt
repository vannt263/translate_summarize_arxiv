    "percolation theory , going back as far as broadbent and hammersley @xcite , describes the flow of fluid in a porous medium with stochastically blocked channels . in terms of mathematics , it consists in removing each edge ( or each vertex ) in a lattice with a given probability @xmath3 .",
    "in these days , it has become part of the mainstream in probability and statistical physics .",
    "one can refer to grimmett s book  @xcite for more background .",
    "traditionally , the study of percolation was concerned with the critical probability that is with respect to the question of whether or not there exists an infinite open cluster ",
    "bond percolation on the square lattice and site percolation on the hexagonal lattice are critical for @xmath4 .",
    "this tradition is due to many reasons .",
    "one originates from physics : at the critical probability , a phase transition occurs .",
    "phase transitions are among the most striking phenomena in physics",
    ". a small change in an environmental parameter , such as the temperature or the external magnetic field , can induce huge changes in the macroscopic properties of a system .",
    "another one is from mathematics : the celebrated ` conformal invariance ' conjecture of aizenman and langlands , pouliotthe and saint - aubin  @xcite states that the probabilities of some macroscopic events have conformally invariant limits at criticality which turn out to be very helpful in understanding discrete systems .",
    "this conjecture was expressed in another form by schramm  @xcite . in his seminal paper ,",
    "schramm introduced the percolation exploration path which separates macroscopic open clusters from closed ones and conjectured that this path converges to his conformally invariant schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) curve as the mesh size of the lattice goes to zero .",
    "for critical site percolation on the hexagonal lattice , smirnov @xcite proved the conformal invariance of the scaling limit of crossing probabilities given by cardy s formula .",
    "later on , a detailed proof of the convergence of the critical site percolation exploration path to sle@xmath5 was provided by camia and newman @xcite .",
    "this allows one to use the sle machinery @xcite to obtain new interesting properties of critical site percolation , such as the values of some critical exponents which portray the limiting behavior of the probabilities of certain exceptional events ( arm exponents ) @xcite . for",
    "a review one can refer to @xcite .",
    "usually a slight move in one part may affect the whole situation .",
    "but there is still no proof of convergence of the critical percolation exploration path on general lattices , especially the square lattice , to sle@xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that the proofs in the site percolation on the hexagonal lattice case depend heavily on the particular properties of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "however much progress has been made in recent years , thanks to sle , in understanding the geometric and topological properties of ( the scaling limit of ) large discrete systems . besides the percolation exploration path on the triangular lattice ,",
    "many random self - avoiding lattice paths from the statistical physics literature are proved to have sle as scaling limits , such as loop erased random walks and uniform spanning tree peano paths @xcite , the harmonic explorer s path  @xcite , the level lines of the discrete gaussian free field  @xcite , the interfaces of the fk ising model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall prove the convergence of the exploration path of the critical bond percolation on the square lattice ( which is an interface between open and closed edges after certain boundary conditions have been applied ",
    "see figure [ figg1 ] and [ figg2 ] ) to the trace of sle@xmath0 and as a consequence the conformal invariance of the scaling limit is established .",
    "let @xmath6 be a domain in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "first we consider the following metric on curves from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in @xmath6 : @xmath11 } |\\nu_{1}(t)-\\nu_{2}(\\sigma(t))| , \\label{metric}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] are any two curves from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in @xmath6 and the infimum is taken over all reparamaterizations @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] is a continuous surjective non - decreasing function .",
    "[ main ] the critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice converges in distribution in the metric given by ( [ metric ] ) to the trace of sle@xmath0 as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero .",
    "the idea of the proof is as follows : by replacing the hexagonal sites in the hexagonal lattice with rectangular sites and then shifting each row left and right in an alternating manner , we can change the hexagonal lattice into a rectangular lattice .",
    "the site percolation exploration path on the hexagonal lattice then induces a pair of paths on the rectangular lattice : the @xmath16bp and @xmath17bp .",
    "the @xmath17bp is the reflection of the @xmath16bp across the @xmath18-axis . by construction of the lattice modification ,",
    "the @xmath16bp and @xmath17bp lie in a @xmath19 neighbourhood of the site percolation exploration path and hence , in particular , both converge to sle@xmath0 in the scaling limit .",
    "we call a vertex of the @xmath16bp path ( respectively the @xmath17bp path ) where the path has 3 choices for the next vertex _ free_. the free vertices are precisely the vertices where the next step is not blocked by vertices that the path has previously visited ( or the boundary )",
    ".    we then condition the @xmath16bp ( respectively the @xmath17bp ) not to go in the same direction for two consecutive edges at the free vertices only and call the conditioned path the @xmath16cbp ( respectively the @xmath17cbp ) .",
    "we then condition further such that the @xmath16cbp ( respectively the @xmath17cbp ) does not go in the same direction for two consecutive edges at all vertices and call the conditioned path the @xmath1cbp ( respectively the @xmath2cbp ) .",
    "it turns out that the bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice squashed to a path on the rectangular lattice can be constructed by alternating pastings of @xmath1cbp and @xmath2cbp paths ; moreover , the @xmath1cbp ( respectively the @xmath2cbp ) can be coupled with a sequence of @xmath16cbp paths ( respectively @xmath17cbp paths ) such that their loewner driving functions are close .",
    "this means that it is sufficient to study the @xmath16cbp .",
    "indeed , we shall show that the driving function of the @xmath16cbp converges subsequentially to an _",
    "@xmath20-semimartingale _ : the sum of a local martingale and a finite @xmath21-variation process for all @xmath22 sufficiently small .",

    "then the locality property of the scaling limit and an infinite divisibility argument can be used to show that we must have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is standard 1-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "hence we have the driving term convergence of the bond percolation exploration process to sle@xmath0 .",
    "we can then get the convergence of the path to the trace of sle@xmath0 either by considering the 4 and 5-arm percolation estimates ( as in @xcite ) or using the recent result of sheffield and sun @xcite and repeating a similar argument .",

    "we obtain certain estimates for the driving function of the @xmath16cbp .",
    "we apply the estimates obtained in section 5 and section 6 to obtain the subsequential driving term convergence to an @xmath20-semimartingale of the @xmath16cbp . by coupling the @xmath16cbp with the @xmath1cbp",
