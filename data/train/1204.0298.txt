    "the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is commonly referred to as @xmath0 and is one of the most important constants , with many applications across a great many fields of science .",
    "it is the only mathematical constant that has its own widely - recognized day of celebration .",
    "the value of @xmath0 has been controversial at least since the time pythagoras drowned a man for asserting its irrationality .",
    "this controversy persists despite theoretical calculation of its value to ridiculously high precision and proofs of its irrationality .",
    "given the importance of @xmath0 it is surprising that there is not much of a literature on its measurement since gauss effectively measured it by testing that the sums of the interior angles of a triangle formed by 3 mountain tops added up to 180 degrees .",
    "i provide a measurement here .",
    "this work is inspired by the indiana house of representatives unanimous vote for a bill that asserted the value of @xmath0 as 3.2 . since this was an astablishment of the value of @xmath0 by legislative means we will refer to it as @xmath2 .",
    "most people react with astonishment to this vote , immediately jumping to the conclusion that it is self - evidently false . even at the time the senate did not go along , so it never became law .",
    "but what if the basis for the house bill , and indeed its actual meaning , has been misunderstood all this time ?",
    "what if they were on to something ?",
    "it is especially troubling that the senate did not even allow a vote on the measure .",
    "how can we know the truth when this bill never even received the open give and take of parliamentary debate ? was the senate trying to hide something ?",
    "fortunately , there are other ways to know .",
    "we can _ measure _ it !",
    "an immediate question is what kind of circle we should use .",
    "circles around spherical mass distributions have @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ratio of circumference to diameter in euclidean geometry . whereas @xmath5 .",
    "such circles will not help us to see how 3.2 can be the correct value .",
    "thus we turn to cosmological circles . the larger a circle we consider , the greater the effect of curvature and",
    "so we wish to study the largest possible circles . here",
    "we conservatively limit ourselves to our own horizon , though consider larger circles in the discussion .",
    "i assumed a @xmath6cdm cosmology with the usual six vanilla parameters , plus one parameter for the mean curvature . using a chain available on the lambda archive that included wmap7 @xcite , bao @xcite and @xmath7 measurements @xcite , as described in @xcite , i calculated the comoving angular - diameter distance to the horizon , @xmath8 and also the comoving distance to the horizon , @xmath9",
    ". then i defined @xmath10 histogramming the chain results in the probability distribution displayed in fig . 1 .     given _",
    "wmap_7 , bao and @xmath7 data and the assumption of a 7-parameter @xmath6cdm model.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "note that in a @xmath6-dominated universe with a small amount of mean curvature the value of @xmath0 varies with time .",
    "we define a `` legislative universe '' ( lu ) as one for which @xmath11 = 3.2 at some point in time . in future work",
    "we will determine the boundary in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane dividing lus from non - lus .",
    "we note that lus require a negative spatial curvature ( positive @xmath12 ) . _ perhaps _ coincidentally , from the string theory landscape we also expect our universe to be one with negative spatial curvature , since tunneling events result in such a geometry . or",
    "perhaps this `` coincidence '' points toward some deep connection between string theory and the theoretical underpinnings of the legislative value .",
    "we tentatively posit that while @xmath14 would be evidence for string theory , @xmath15 would be evidence of this connection",
    ". it might instead be evidence of a connection with the de sitter equilibrium cosmology @xcite , for which one also expects a small negative curvature .",
    "if one adopts a prior that the legislative value must hold for _ some _ circle in the universe , then we can turn the arguments used here around to place a lower limit on the size of the universe .",
    "as long as mean curvature is less than zero ( no matter how close it is to zero ) , if the universe is big enough , the legislative value will hold for a big enough circle .",
    "we have explicitly assumed the standard cosmological model extended to include non - zero mean curvature .",
    "departures from this model would change our interpretation of the data .",
    "in particular , if we consider a model with _ fewer _ species of neutrinos then this increases the sound horizon at last scattering @xcite . in order to keep the angular size of the sound horizon fixed to the observed value , the increased sound horizon means the model would have to adjust in a way to increase the angular - diameter distance to last scattering .",
    "one way to do this is to increase @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "since the data prefer not fewer species , but an excess of species , allowing @xmath16 to vary would put further pressure on @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , adopting a `` legislative prior '' would increase the posterior probability for the standard model value of @xmath16 relative to @xmath18 .",
    "we look forward to new data from the south pole telescope and _ planck _ , combined with new bao measurements , from which we can place tighter constraints on @xmath11 , or , by adopting the legislative prior , interesting lower limits to the size of the univerese ."
