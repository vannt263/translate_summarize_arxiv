    "astrophysical sources of gamma - rays that are both compact and very luminous may be optically thick to pair production ( @xmath13 ) within the source .",
    "the corresponding optical depth , @xmath14 , is usually an increasing function of the photon energy , and therefore a large optical depth would prevent the escape of high - energy photons from the source , causing a high - energy cutoff in the observed spectrum . for sufficiently high optical depths ,",
    "enough @xmath15 pairs may be produced , so that the optical depth of all photons ( even low energy photons that are optically thin to pair production ) to scattering on these electrons / positrons would be much larger than unity , in which case the photon energy spectrum would be thermalized .",
    "the size of the gamma - ray emitting region is usually hard to constrain directly from observations , since the angular resolution of gamma - ray telescopes is much poorer than their counterparts in lower energy photons ( e.g. x - rays , optical , or radio ) .",
    "nevertheless , the physical properties of the emitting region can be constrained using compactness arguments , and the observed properties of the source .",
    "in particular , rapid flux variability of the source is often used in order to set upper limits on the size of the emitting region , making highly variable sources with significant non - thermal high - energy emission a prime target for such analysis .",
    "one of the best examples for such sources are gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and we shall focus on them below , although most of our analysis has a much broader range of applicability ( similar opacity considerations have also been used to constrain the properties of other sources , such as blazars , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has been realized early on that , in grbs , pair production within the source is expected to cause a high - energy cutoff in the observed photon energy spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "naively , if the source shows significant flux variability on an observed time scale of @xmath7 , its size is inferred to be @xmath16 where @xmath17 is its cosmological redshift , and the optical depth to pair production at a dimensionless photon energy @xmath18 is @xmath19[\\delta t/(1\\;{\\rm ms})]^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the source isotropic equivalent luminosity and observed flux per unit dimensionless photon energy , and @xmath22 is the luminosity distance to the source . for grbs",
    "the ( observed part of the ) @xmath23 spectrum typically peaks around @xmath24 , and being at cosmological distances their isotropic equivalent luminosity is typically in the range of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , they often show significant variability down to millisecond timescales .",
    "this implies huge values of @xmath14 , as high as @xmath26 , under the above naive assumptions .",
    "such huge optical depths are clearly inconsistent with the non - thermal grb spectrum , which has a significant power law high - energy tail .",
    "this is known as the compactness problem @xcite .    if the source is moving relativistically toward us with a lorentz factor @xmath27 , then in its own rest frame the photons have smaller energies , @xmath28 , while in the lab frame ( i.e. the rest frame of the central source ) most of the photons propagate at angles @xmath29 relative to its direction of motion .",
    "the latter implies that in the lab frame the typical angle between the directions of the interacting photons is @xmath30 , which has two effects .",
    "first , it increases the threshold for pair production , @xmath31 , to @xmath32 ( compared to @xmath33 for the roughly isotropic distribution of angles between the directions of the interacting photons in the rest frame of the source , where @xmath34 ) .",
    "this reduces @xmath35 by a factor of @xmath36 where @xmath37 at high photon energies ( corresponding to @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 is the high - energy photon index ) , since @xmath40 needs to be replaced by @xmath41 .",
    "second , the expression for the optical depth includes a factor of @xmath42 ( that represents the rate at which photons pass each other and have an opportunity to interact ) which for a stationary source is @xmath43 , but for a relativistic source moving toward us is @xmath44 .",
    "finally , the size of the emitting region can be as large as @xmath45 , which reduces @xmath14 by an additional factor of @xmath46 .",
    "altogether , @xmath35 is reduced by a factor of @xmath47 , and since typically @xmath48 this usually implies @xmath49 in order to have @xmath50 and overcome the compactness problem . using similar arguments ,",
    "the lack of such a high - energy cutoff due to pair production in the observed spectrum of the prompt gamma - ray emission in grbs has been used to place lower limits on the lorentz factor of the outflow @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath14 generally depends both on the radius of emission , @xmath51 , and on the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath52 : @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , one needs to assume a relation between @xmath51 and @xmath54 in order to obtain a lower limit on the latter .",
    "most works assume @xmath55 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gives @xmath56 , while the lack of a high - energy cutoff up to some photon energy @xmath57 implies @xmath58 .",
    "this , in turn , provides a lower limit on @xmath54 since one can directly measure the variability time @xmath7 , the photon index @xmath39 , and @xmath59 .",
    "however , the relation @xmath60 does not hold for all models of the prompt grb emission .",
    "for example , this relation does not hold if the prompt grb emission is generated by relativistic magnetic reconnection events , with angular scales @xmath61 , that create local relativistic motion with lorentz factor @xmath62 relative to the average bulk value @xmath54 of the emitting shell @xcite . in this case @xmath63 and the inferred value of the lorentz factor from standard opacity arguments would be @xmath64 rather than the bulk lorentz factor of the shell , @xmath54 .",
    "this allows the radius of the prompt emission to be as large as @xmath65 cm , close to the deceleration radius where most of the energy of the outflow is transferred to the swept - up external medium , and is much larger than the prompt emission radius that is expected in the internal shocks model , @xmath66 cm .",
    "therefore , we adopt a more model - independent approach and do not automatically make this assumption . instead , we derive most of our formulas without this assumption , as well as derive expressions for @xmath54 under this assumption , which could serve in order to test its validity .",
    "the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) mission @xcite , to be launched in early 2008 , is expected to shed light on the high - energy emission from grbs and other impulsive relativistic sources .",
    "in particular , opacity effects due to the local photon field within the source ) only at cosmological redshifts ( @xmath67 ) and for very high photon energies ( @xmath68gev at @xmath69 and @xmath70gev at @xmath71 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is therefore likely to significantly affect only the high end of the glast energy range , where the photon statistic might be too poor to reliably measure this effect .",
    "this source of opacity will be independent of time ( and depends only on the redshift of the source , and on the photon energy ) , which would help in disentangling it from the time dependent opacity intrinsic to the source that we calculate in this work . ]",
    "are expected to be most relevant in the glast large area telescope ( lat ) energy range ( 20 mev to more than @xmath72gev , see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it represents a powerful tool for probing the physics of these sources .",
    "glast is likely to detect the high - energy cutoff due to pair production opacity which would actually determine @xmath73 , rather than just provide a lower limit for it .",
    "furthermore , in grbs , the outflow lorentz factor @xmath54 may be constrained by the time of the afterglow onset @xcite , provided that the reverse shock is not highly relativistic , so that if glast detects the high - energy pair production opacity cutoff , the radius of emission @xmath51 could be directly constrained , thus helping to test the different grb models .",
    "in particular , this could directly test whether the relation @xmath74 that is expected in many models indeed holds , since both @xmath51 and @xmath54 could be determined separately .",
    "this , however , requires a reliable way of identifying the observed signatures of opacity to pair production .",
    "this is one of the main motivations for this work .",
    "the leading model for the prompt emission in grbs features internal shocks @xcite due to collisions between shells that are ejected from the source at ultra - relativistic speeds ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the shells are typically quasi - spherical , i.e. their properties do not vary a lot over angles @xmath76 around our line of sight .",
    "under the typical physical conditions that are expected in the shocked shells , all electrons cool on a time scale much shorter than the dynamical time ( i.e. the time it takes the shock to cross the shell ) , and most of the radiation is emitted within a very thin cooling layer just behind the shock front .",
    "thus , our model which features an emitting spherical thin shell that expands outward ultra - relativistically is appropriate for the internal shocks model .",
    "as this emitting `` shell '' expands outward to larger radii , it builds up a photon field that can pair produce with high - energy photons from the same emission component .",
    "this effect has been studied in the past ( see especially * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but the temporal and spatial dependences of the photon field have been averaged out , corresponding either explicitly or implicitly to a quasi - steady state .",
    "however , in impulsive relativistic sources , the time scale for significant variations in the properties of the radiation field within the source is comparable to the total duration of the emission episode , and therefore the dependence of the opacity to pair production on space and time can not be ignored , and may produce important effects that are suppressed in the steady - state limit .",
    "therefore , in the present work we consider the full temporal and spatial dependence of the opacity , in order to capture all the resulting effects .",
    "we develop a simple , yet rich , model to investigate quantitatively the intuitive consideration that in impulsive sources it takes time to build up the ( target ) photon field , and thus the optical depth initially increases with time , so that high energy photons might be able to escape the source mainly at the very early part of the spike in the light curve .",
    "this results in a power law tail for the time - integrated spectrum at high energies , while the instantaneous spectrum ( which is hard to measure due to poor photon statistics ) has an exponential cutoff .",
    "this arises since the photon energy of the exponential cutoff in the instantaneous spectrum decreases with time , as the opacity increases with time at all energies .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high photon energies , most of the photons escape during the short initial time before the optical depth increases above unity , i.e. before the cutoff energy sweeps past their energy .",
    "we perform detailed semi - analytic calculations of the optical depth to pair production , which improve on previous works by first calculating the photon field at each point in space and time , and then integrating along the trajectory of each photon .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : flux ] we introduce our model and derive a general expression for the flux that reaches an observer at infinity .",
    "this expression includes the optical depth along the trajectory of each photon that may reach the observer , which is derived in  [ sec : tau ] .",
    "the calculation of the optical depth requires the knowledge of the photon field at each point along the trajectory of each ( test ) photon . this local photon field",
    "is first expressed in terms of the source emissivity (  [ subsec : emissivity ] ) .",
    "next (  [ sec : red ] ) it is conveniently rewritten as the product of the typical optical depth ( that is approached on a dynamical time , and is similar to that derived in previous works ) and dimensionless order unity expression ( containing a few integrals ) which captures the new time dependent effects that are the focus of this work . in  [ sec : gfield ] explicit expressions are derived for the integrands of these dimensionless order unity integrals . in  [ sec : analytic ] we derive the relevant analytic scalings for the resulting optical depths and observed flux , and in  [ sec : res ] we present numerical results ( i.e. numerically evaluate the semi - analytic expressions ) for the opacity , light curves , and spectra ( both the instantaneous and time - integrated spectra are addressed in   [ sec : analytic ] and [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we consider an ultra - relativistic ( with lorentz factor @xmath77 ) , thin ( of width @xmath78 in the lab frame ) spherical expanding shell , that emits over a finite range of radii , @xmath79 ( i.e. the emission turns on at @xmath80 and turns off at @xmath81 ) .",
    "this model can be associated with a single pulse or flare in the light curve . in the context of internal shocks within the outflow",

    "the emission is assumed to be isotropic in the co - moving frame of the emitting shell ( i.e. the shell rest frame ) , and uniform over the spherical shell . in this work primed quantities",
    "are always measured in the co - moving frame , while unprimed quantities are evaluated either in the lab frame , that is the rest frame of the central source , in which the shell is spherical ( e.g. the lorentz factor @xmath54 ) , or in the observer frame ( e.g. the observed time and photon energy which suffer cosmological time dilation and redshift , respectively , relative to the lab frame which is at the cosmological redshift of the source ) .",
    "the observer is assumed to be located at a distance from the source that is much larger than the source size ( so that the angle subtended by the source , as seen by the observer , is very small , and the observer can be considered as being at `` infinity '' ) .    for convenience",

    "our two main results are the follwoing .",
    "first , while the instantaneous spectrum ( which is typically very hard to measure due to poor photon statistics ) has an exponential cutoff at high photon energies , the time integrated spectrum over the duration of a flare or spike in the light curve ( which is easier to measure ) has a power - law high - energy tail .",
    "second , photons above this spectral break in the time integrated spectrum arrive mainly near the onset of the flare or spike in the light curve .",
    "these two features provide a unique detectable signature of opacity to pair production , making it easier to identify observationally .",
    "furthermore , these features are expected to be fairly robust , even if the exact details ( such as the exact change in the spectral slope across the break , @xmath698 , or the exact shape of the light curve at high photon energies above the spectral break ) may depend on the details of the model ( such as the exact geometry , which is assumed to be spherical in our model ) .",
    "the reason behind these features is that in impulsive sources the photon field starts from zero ( or more realistically a non - zero value , which is still much lower than that near the peak of the flare or spike in the light curve ) and builds - up with time , so that the optical depth to pair production , @xmath14 , increases with time , and high energy photons can escape mainly at early times while @xmath14 is still below unity .",
    "a source is considered impulsive for our purposes if the photon field in the source and its vicinity changes considerably within the source light crossing time . in this limit the time dependence of the photon field and the resulting opacity to",
    "pair production is important .",
    "this can naturally occur in relativistic sources , but is hard to produce in non - relativistic sources ( since it requires a relativistic signal in order to turn the emission on or off on a time scale of the order of the light crossing time of the source ) . in the opposite limit , where the photon field hardly varies within the source light crossing time , the photon field may be approximated as constant in time along the trajectory of the photons , and can be evaluated at the time of emission ( this is considered a `` quasi - steady '' state ) . in our model ,",
    "the photon field approaches a quasi - steady state within a few light crossing times of the emitting region ( @xmath699 ) . if the source is active for much longer times ( @xmath700 ) , the time integrated spectrum",
    "will usually be dominated by this late time quasi - steady emission , and an exponential high - energy cutoff develops , while the high - energy power - law tail becomes increasingly suppressed .",
    "for this reason , in order for the source to be impulsive , the duration of the emission should be at most comparable to the light crossing time of the source ( @xmath701 ) .",
    "we have considered a single , isolated emission episode which corresponds to a single flare or spike in the observed light curve .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed no background photon field at the time when the emission turns on . these are obviously idealized assumptions and it is worth considering , at least qualitatively at this stage , the modifications that may occur when these ideal conditions are not satisfied . for the prompt emission or x - ray flares in grbs the background quasi - steady photon field",
    "is expected to be very low and not contribute significantly to @xmath14 .",
    "this is probably also true for blazars of bl lac type . in other types of blazars (",
    "quasar hosted blazars ) , however , the external photon field , mainly due to emission from the accretion disk and its scattered photons from the clouds in the broad line region , is expected to provide the dominant contribution to @xmath14 in the source , even during flares @xcite . in this case",
    ", our model would not be applicable , since the external radiation field would prevent the escape of high - energy photons near the onset of the spike , resulting in @xmath14 that is largely independent of time .    regarding the assumption that the flare / spike is isolated , in many cases there are series of flares , so that except for the first flare in the series for which our assumption should hold very well , for consecutive flares the high energy photons could in principle pair produce with photons emitted in previous flares .",
    "this will be highly suppressed if the time from the end of the previous flare is much larger than its duration .",
    "even if these two times are comparable , pair production is still significantly suppressed since the relevant photons can meet only further away from the source , where the photon density is smaller and the angle between the directions of the photons ( in the lab frame ) is smaller . such a proximity in time to a previous flare / spike",
    "will still increase @xmath14 to some degree , but this will affect mainly the highest energy photons , with energies well above the spectral break in the time integrated spectrum over the duration of the flare / spike , which are relatively hard to detect due to the smaller number of photons at such high energies . therefore , in practical terms , the differences from our idealized model are not expected to be very large .",
    "this may even make it meaningful to integrate the spectrum over many spikes / flares in order to increase the photon statistics , in cases where the number of photons detected in individual spikes is not large enough to enable a good spectral analysis .",
    "other sources of opacity , such as scattering of photons on the pairs that are produced , are also possible .",
    "the latter , however , is expected to build - up in time on a comparable time scale to that of the opacity to pair production that we study here .",
    "therefore , it is not expected to have a significant impact on our main conclusions .",
    "opacity for scattering on the electrons associated with the baryons or with preexisting pairs within the outflow is also possible .",
    "however , it will not greatly vary within a single dynamical time , and should also affect lower energy photons ( where the larger number of photons enables a better spectral analysis ) .",
    "furthermore , it is suppressed at high photon energies due to the reduction in the cross section in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "moreover , we find a rather unique combined spectral and temporal signature for the opacity to pair production , which could help distinguish between it and other sources of opacity",
