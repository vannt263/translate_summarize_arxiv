    "fast developments are now occurring in studies at the interface between different kinds of physical systems .",
    "examples of these include : couplings between light and nano / micro - mechanical systems ( e.g. ,  mancini , meystre , vitali , penrose , tombesi2,tombesi3,meystre2,meystre3,meystre4,meystre5 ) , called optomechanical systems ; interactions between superconducting artificial atoms ( e.g. , charge or flux qubit ) and transmission line resonators  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and so on .",
    "these studies are partly motivated by possible physical implementations of quantum information processing , to explore potential future devices , and to study the interesting physics in these hybrid structures .    in optomechanical systems ( e.g. ,  mancini , meystre , vitali , penrose , tombesi2,tombesi3,meystre2,meystre3,meystre5 ) , the radiation pressure acts on the oscillating mirror and induces the interaction between the mechanical system and the optical field .",
    "the back - action from the mirror to the cavity field @xcite can result in several ( about 5 ) steady - state solutions for the equilibrium position of the mirror .",
    "it has been proved  @xcite that this system experiences bistability in some parameter region .",
    "it has also been shown that light pressure can be used to realize entanglement between the cavity field and a microscopic object ( e.g. , a moveable mirror )  mancini , meystre , vitali , penrose , and can also cool down the mirror  tombesi2,tombesi3,meystre2,meystre3 .",

    "@xcite studied optomechanical cavities containing a two - level atomic ensemble .",
    "the atomic ensemble effectively enhances the radiation pressure of the cavity field on the oscillating mirror , producing a cavity - atom - mirror entanglement  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider this atom - optical system with a more complex atomic ensemble , which can enable quantum interference , e.g. , electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is a remarkable quantum interference phenomenon , which enables the active control of light propagation in a coherent medium  @xcite .",
    "usually , the basic population transfer configuration for the atoms in eit is of @xmath0-type , where the two transitions from a common upper energy level to two lower energy levels are induced by two different optical fields ( e.g. , classical control field and probe quantized field )  scully1,liyong , lukin1 , respectively .",
    "one is a strong field , and the other is a weak one .",
    "the stronger field can effectively modify the susceptibility of the medium so that the weak one ( as a probe signal ) can pass through the medium transparently at the two - photon - resonance  scully , deng , kozuma , liyong1,he .",
    "recently , it has been shown that this effect can also work well at the single photon level for the probe light  @xcite , and thus the weak field must be treated quantum mechanically . in the quantum approach , a dark state with dressed photons can be invoked to store quantum information of photons on the atomic ensemble as quantum memory  @xcite .",
    "these quantum manipulations at the single photon level require frequency - matching with extremely high - precision for one- or two- photon resonances .",
    "when the quantum field is provided by a micro - cavity with a one - end oscillating mirror , the oscillation of the mirror might affect such a precise frequency - matching condition and thus affect the eit .",
    "motivated by these works , here we study how the oscillating mirror changes the properties of the eit .",
    "we will study the atom - assisted optomechanical micro - cavity , through which we explore the possibility to interface other systems , via some physical mechanism , such as eit . here ,",
    "the atomic ensemble for each atom with @xmath0-type transitions is placed inside a cavity with a one - end oscillating mirror . due to the mirror s oscillation",
    ", the susceptibility of this atomic medium displays a multi - stability corresponding to the multi - equilibrium positions of the mirror .",
    "another prediction of our study is that the mirror s oscillation significantly alters the properties of both the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility .",
    "we also investigate in detail how the different steady states of the mirror influence the dispersion relations and absorption properties of the light .",

    "ii , we introduce the model for the optomechanical system with eit ; in sec .",
    "iii , we present the heisenberg - langevin equations for this system and obtain several ( from one to five , depending on the system parameters ) steady - state solutions for the position of the oscillating mirror ; in sec .",
