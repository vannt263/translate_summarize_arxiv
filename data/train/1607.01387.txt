    "the kernel of the boundary map modulo the group of boundaries of one - higher dimensional cells is called a * homology * group .",
    "there is one homology group at each `` dimension '' : formally we set @xmath794 and @xmath795 , and define @xmath796 for @xmath797 .",
    "we could define these homology groups without ever involving the laurent polynomial ring , which was rather a convenient extra feature allowed by the cartesian array of small squares .",
    "although it is a another problem how one can identify the homology group , there is no problem of defining the homology group given any tessellation of the space into small polygons . to little ( or big ) surprise",
    ", it is very important that the resulting homology group is independent of the tessellation ( cell decomposition ) .",
    "more general homology theory  @xcite is beyond the scope of this note , but one can think of a toy version where one square from our tessellation is divided into two triangles . in this case one can show that the homology groups remain the same . on top of this , one can show that any two tessellations can be refined by a process of such subdivisions to become the same tessellation , which leads the independence of the homology group on tessellations .",
    "the simplest tessellation would be to have only a single square to cover the entire space ( the two - dimensional torus ) , with vertices and edges properly identified .",
    "this is to set @xmath798 in our earlier discussion , in which case the homology groups are clearly seen as @xmath799 , @xmath800 , and @xmath801 .        as of this writing",
    ", there is no known structure theorem for stabilizer modules in three or higher dimensions . in terms of pure commutative algebra",
    "this problem appears not too well guided , since under a fairly mild condition any chain complex obtained by continued calculation of kernels ( free resolution ) gives rise to stabilizer module with large code distances .",
    "general one - dimensional and css two - dimensional cases were fortunately simple enough that we could handle directly .    from a physical viewpoint , one can focus on the behavior of excitations .",
    "we briefly defined the excitations as a flipped term of a hamiltonian , but we did not give any further attributes to the excitations . the most important notion to begin with",
    "is that of topological excitations  an excitation that can not be created alone from a ground state by any local operator .",
    "the topological excitation is insensitive to local basis change ( clifford transformations ) , relabeling of terms of the hamiltonian , or the translation structure .",
    "the set of all point - like topological excitations is identified with the torsion submodule of the cokernel of the excitation map  @xcite , and it is no coincidence that we introduced the torsion submodule in the structure theorem for 2d css codes .",
    "it is a characteristic of a code that is invariant under various basis changes .",
    "there is conceptual progress from our consideration of additive codes and corresponding hamiltonians , which is surprising from a conventional perspective on topological order .",
    "it has been for long taken granted that a point - like topological excitations has well - defined `` statistics , '' a consistent number that the quantum mechanical state vector acquires upon exchanging two such excitations .",
    "following our formalism , it is easy to show that this is not always the case . in three or higher dimensions ,",
    "there are many systems of which point - like topological excitations can not have well - defined `` statistics '' since their motion is ill - defined  @xcite .    to illustrate the point more clearly , consider the toric code excitation map : @xmath802 , the cokernel of which is @xmath803/(x-1,y-1 ) \\cong { \\mathbb{f}}_2 $ ] . an element of the cokernel is an equivalence class of flipped terms in the hamiltonian modulo those that can be flipped by local pauli operators .",
    "thus , the element of @xmath739 is precisely what we call a topological excitation .",
    "the action from the translation group on @xmath804 is trivial .",
    "this means that a topological excitation at one location is connected to that at other location by some local operator , implying that the `` motion '' is allowed by some other interaction .",
    "the algebraic origin to this conclusion is that the excitation map have binomial elements @xmath647 and @xmath648 in the image @xmath805 . in higher dimensions , there is no reason for the excitation map to have a binomial term in the image , in which case the notion of motion for topological excitations becomes ambiguous .",
    "an example in three dimensions is given by @xmath806 , known as the cubic code  @xcite .",
    "the reader is encouraged to show that @xmath807 can not generate a binomial term in the image .",
    "in fact , @xmath739 does not have any binomial zero - divisor .",
    "the behavior of topological excitations can be even richer . in four or higher dimensions ,",
    "there is a system in which a single hamiltonian term can not be flipped alone  @xcite , but they have to appear as a line or in some other more complicated shape .",
    "there is a way of defining line - like topological excitations if the hamiltonian consists of commuting terms  @xcite , but a concise algebraic characterization for additive code systems is immature .",
    "the author thanks cesar galindo - martinez and julia plavnik for their hospitality during the workshop in bogot , colombia , and hctor bombn for guiding along his paper  @xcite .",
