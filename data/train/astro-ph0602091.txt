    "cyg x-1 is one of the brightest high - energy sources in the sky , with an average 1 - 200 kev energy flux of @xmath4 ergs @xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "its optical companion is an o9.7 iab supergiant hde 226868 .",
    "estimates of the mass , m , of the x - ray star , @xmath7 [ e.g. , @xcite ] strongly suggest the presence of a black hole . observed spectral and temporal x - ray characteristics",
    "are extensively studied based on the large amount of data collected in the _ rxte _ archive ( see  2 for the data description ) .",
    "our analysis includes @xmath0 2.2 ms of rossi x - ray time explorer ( _ rxte _ ) archival data from cyg x-1 to study the spectral and timing properties of this classical bhc source .",
    "one of the basic questions addressed in many observational and theoretical studies concerning relativistic compact objects is how to observationally distinguish between a neutron star ( ns ) and a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "cyg x-1 , being extensively studied , has often been used as the prototypical example of a bh .",
    "the different patterns , for example correlations between spectral and timing characteristics of bh and ns sources , has been proposed as a criteria for determination of the nature of the compact object .",
    "recently belloni ( 2005 ) and @xcite published a concise review of the observational features of the spectral states in bh sources where they also point out a link between timing and spectral properties of x - ray radiation and plasma ejection leading to radio jets .",
    "@xcite , hereafter tf04 , and @xcite , hereafter tsh05 , present theoretical and observational arguments how to distinguish between bh and ns binaries .",
    "tf04 present observational evidence that in bhs two distinct phases occur : one of them , the steep power - law phase ( so `` called '' high / soft state ) , is the signature of a bh . in the soft state of bh the spectral index - quasiperiodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequency correlation shows a flattening , or `` saturation '' of the photon index @xmath8 at high values of the low frequency @xmath9 .",
    "this saturation effect was identified as a bh signature .",
    "tsh05 demonstrate that this saturation is not present in at least one ns source .",
    "they show that for 4u 1728 - 34 the index @xmath10 increases monotonically with @xmath9 .",
    "we show here that cyg x-1 is a perfect example of a bh source as the suggested bh index - qpo frequency correlation is observed with clear features of the saturation at high and low frequencies .",
    "long - term monitoring of cyg x-1 has revealed two distinct spectral states and transitions between them [ see a review of cyg x-1 early observations in @xcite ] .",
    "simultaneous , low- and high energy x - ray observations during interstate transitions have been obtained by several groups in 1996 [ see references in @xcite and @xcite ] . in the low / hard state , the power - law portion of the spectrum is relatively flat with a photon index @xmath10 of about 1.5 .",
    "they found that a majority of the time cyg x-1 stayed in the low / hard with an occasional transition ( during their observations , duty cycle of this state was about 90 % ) to the soft state where the power - law spectrum became significantly steeper ( with @xmath11 ) . also , one or two times per year cyg x-1 exhibited so called `` failed state transitons '' , when it started to transition but did not reach a soft state , stopping at some intermediate state and their falling back .",
    "thus one can claim that the source was predominantly in a hard state in 90s .",
    "however wilms et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have recently shown that since 2000 the source spent @xmath12 of the time in the intermediate and the soft state .",
    "we came to the same conclusion as a result of our analysis of the source spectral transition ( see more discussion of this phenomenon in  4 , the last paragraph ) .    as @xcite pointed out there",
    "is strong evidence that the observed qpo characteristics are related to spectral properties : the qpo amplitude increases as the energy spectrum becomes harder .",
    "they also discovered qpo low - frequencies varying in the range of 4 - 10 hz during the spectral transition .",
    "in fact , using these observations di matteo & psaltis ( 1999 ) , hereafter dp99 , found that the photon index can be correlated with the qpo frequency .",
    "one can see a few points of this correlation in the frequency range from 1 to 10 hz in their figure 1 .",
    "this behavior was later confirmed by @xcite , hereafter p03 , using observations of the cyg x-1 spectral transition in 2000 - 2001 .",
    "it is worth noting that dp99 also suggested that the index - qpo frequency correlation can be a common phenomenon for black hole sources .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of spectral transitions in cyg x-1 and demonstrate how the energy spectra are related to the power density spectra ( pdss ) , in particular the qpo features .",
    "we find that the index - qpo correlation is similar to previous findings for bh sources , e.g. dp99 , @xcite and tf04 , where the qpo frequency - index correlation is presented for large samples of bh sources",
    ". in pdss observed by _",
    "rxte _ for cyg x-1 , we show that these qpo low frequencies tightly correlate with the break frequency @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite presented a model for the radial oscillations and diffusion in the transition layer ( tl ) surrounding the bh and ns . using dimensional analysis",
    ", they identified the corresponding radial oscillation and diffusion frequencies in the tl with the low - lorentzian @xmath2 and break frequencies @xmath13 for 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "they predicted values for @xmath13 related to the diffusion in the transition layer , that are consistent with the observed @xmath13 .",
    "both the keplerian and radial oscillations , along with diffusion in the transition layer , are controlled by the same parameter : the reynolds number @xmath14 ( inverse of @xmath15-viscosity parameter ) , which in turn is related to the accretion rate [ see also @xcite , hereafter tlm98 ] . it is worth noting that the identification of the break frequency as a diffusion effect ( the inverse of time of the diffusion propagation in the bounded configuration ) was later corroborated by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "particularly , wood et al . demonstrated that the black hole candidate ( bhc ) xte 1118 + 480 x - ray light curves with fast rise / exponential decay profile are a consequence of the diffusion matter propagation in the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "gilfanov & arefiev ( 2005 ) studied x - ray variability of persistent lmxbs in the @xmath16 hz frequency range aiming to detect pds features associated with the diffusion time scale of the accretion disk @xmath17 .",
    "as this is the longest intrinsic time scale of the disk , the power spectrum is expected to be independent of the frequency below @xmath18 .",
    "they found that the break frequency correlates very well with the binary orbital frequency in a broad range of binary periods from @xmath19 min to 33.5 days , in accord with theoretical expectations for the diffusion time scale of the disk .",
    "@xcite found while the low - energy x - ray ( 1.3 - 12 kev ) and high - energy x - ray ( 20 - 200 kev ) fluxes strongly anticorrelate during the spectral transition , the bolometric luminosity in the soft states may only be 50%-70% greater than the hard state luminosity . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that the increase of the bolometric flux in the high / soft state with respect to that in the low / hard state is about s factor of @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we further explore this issue of the bolometric luminosity using the data collected from the pca and hexte detectors of _ rxte_. in fact , we confirm zhang s et al . finding that the bolometric luminosity slightly increases when cyg x-1 undergoes transition from the low / hard to the soft states .",
    "we also comment on the issue of how the wind in cyg x-1 affects the bolometric luminosity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that the x - ray source in cyg x-1 is powered mainly by accretion from the strong stellar wind of the supergiant star .",
    "cyg x-1 probably represents a situation intermediate between pure , spherical wind accretion and accretion by roche lobe overflow .",
    "as @xcite pointed out the density of the wind determines the size of x - ray ionization zone surrounding the black hole .",
    "this in turn controls the acceleration of the wind in the direction of the black hole . during the low / hard state ,",
    "the strong wind is fast and accretion rate is relatively low , while during the soft state , the weaker , ionized wind attains only a moderate velocity and the accretion rate increases .",
    "it is evident that the thomson optical depth of the wind increases in spectral transition because of decrease of the wind velocity ( even if outflow mass rate is constant through the state transition ) .",
    "we further investigate the effects of the wind in cyg x-1 in terms of power and energy spectra , bolometric luminosities and the strength of k@xmath3 iron line emission .",
    "the iron line observed in cyg x-1 is the strongest among the galactic black holes .",
    "@xcite discovered the broad fe k@xmath3 line , with equivalent width @xmath21 ev and fwhm=1.2 kev in an _ exosat _ spectrum of cyg x-1 .",
    "because of these features are broad one should be concerned that the profiles are artifacts of inadequate continuum models or instrumental effects .",
    "miller et al . ( 2002 ) argue that an fe k@xmath3 line is required to obtain statistically acceptable fits to spectra observed from cyg x-1 with a number of instruments , for a variety of continuum models and source luminosities [ see @xcite , and @xcite for _ asca _ results , and see @xcite and @xcite for _ bepposax _ results ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that most of the observations indicate that the relatively strong broad fe k@xmath3 line emission which ew is within a range of 100 - 300 ev while miller et al .",
    "claim their best - fit model for chandra spectrum includes a broad line ( @xmath22 kev , fwhm@xmath23 kev , @xmath24 ev ) component along with a narrow gaussian emission line ( @xmath25 kev , fwhm@xmath26 ev , @xmath27 ev ) component .",
    "it is clear that the inferred values of line energy e , fwhm and ew are affected by the energy resolution of a given instrument and by the continuum model applied [ see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "recently @xcite revealed a strong and broad fe k@xmath3 line in another black hole source , grs 1915 + 105 ( @xmath28 ev ) .",
    "they suggest that there should be a link between ews and qpo frequencies in bh sources . here",
    "we show that indeed there are correlations between the strength of the iron line , qpo frequency and the spectral index .",
    "the observational signature of the mass accretion rate @xmath29 is the qpo low frequency as it has been shown for bh sources by tf04 .",
    "the qpo frequency is related not only to @xmath29 but also to the size of the comptonizing region , @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 . the behavior of @xmath32 with respect to spectral index @xmath10 connects the characteristics of the comptonization and spectral state with @xmath29 .",
    "this is graphically represented for bhs in the observations of @xcite .",
    "we similarly employ this type of analysis to compare cyg x-1 spectral states with other bhs to show their qualitative differences .    in  2 we present the details of the our spectral and timing data analysis of archival rxte data from the bh source cyg x-1 . in ",
    "3 we present and discuss the results of the data analysis and we compare them to that presented by tf04 for other bh sources . in ",
    "3 we also offer an explanation various correlations found in cyg x-1 .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in  4 .",
    "for our analysis we used data from proportional counter array ( pca ) and high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) onboard _ rxte_. the data is available through the gsfc public archive .",
    "cyg x-1 is one of the sources most extensively observed by _",
    "rxte_. we searched the entire archive for public data .",
    "the summary of the _ rxte _ observation proposals and data used in the present analysis , and a reference to the corresponding proposal ids , are given in table 1 .",
    "each proposal consists of a set observations that can be divided into intervals of continuous on - source exposure ( usually about 3 ks ) corresponding to one _ rxte _ orbit . for each proposal",
    "we provide its archival identification number ( proposal i d ) , the dates between which the data were collected , the total on - source exposure , the number of continuous data intervals @xmath33 , the average number of operational pcus in the proposal @xmath34 .",
    "the data spans @xmath35 years of data with almost 2.2 ms of the total on - source exposure .",
    "we calculated an energy spectrum and an averaged pds for each continuous interval of data , which correspond to one orbital _",
    "rxte _ revolution .",
    "data reduction and analysis was conducted with ftools 5.3 software according to recipes in the `` _ rxte _ cook book '' .      before being transmitted to ground - based station",
    "the pca data is preprocessed by six event analyzers , two of which are always operating in standard1 and standard2 modes . to avoid telemetry overload for very bright sources such as cyg x-1",
    "the counts from several energy ranges are processed by separate on - board event analyzers and stored in separate data files . during most observations ,",
    "binned mode with several millisecond time resolution combining counts from 0 to 35 pca energy channels is available .",
    "depending on rxte epoch , this channel range corresponds to energy range changing from 1.5 - 10 kev to 2.0 - 15 kev .",
    "we were mostly interested in low frequency range ( @xmath36 100 hz ) and the temporal resolution of this mode is sufficient for our analysis .",
    "otherwise , we used sub - millisecond resolution event or single bit mode data .",
    "the data was rebinned to a @xmath37 second time resolution to obtain a nyquist frequency of 1024 hz .",
    "pdss are normalized to give rms fractional variability per hz . for the pds modeling we used the broken power law",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for definition ) component to fit broad band frequency noise and lorentzians to describe qpo profiles .",
    "spectral data reduction and modeling was performed using the xspec astrophysical fitting package .",
    "first we performed the data screening to calculate good time intervals for fourier analysis .",
    "we excluded the data collected for elevation angles less than @xmath38 and during south atlantic anomaly passage . to avoid the electron contamination we also applied the condition for electron rate in the pcu 2 ( which is operational during all observations ) to be less than 0.1 counts / sec .",
    "we extract energy spectra from standard2 data files using counts from upper xenon layer of all operational detectors .",
    "then we applied a deadtime correction to account for detector dwell time after each event detection .",
    "current response matrices for pca and hexte give 10%-20% offset for relative cross - normalization . henceforth , when we fit pca and hexte spectra simultaneously , we multiply the physical model applied to the data by a constant factor to account for this instrumental discrepancy .",
    "we fix the factor value at unity for pca data set while allowing it to change for the hexte cluster a and b spectra . in table",
    "[ statestab ] we give the values of the best fit model parameters along with the offset values obtained for representative pca / hexte spectrum for each source state .    to describe the continuum spectrum we use the bulk motion comptonization ( _ bmc _ ) model which is a generic comptonization model .",
    "this model can be used if the photon energy is less than the mean electron energy of the compton cloud @xmath39 .",
    "the choice of a particular theoretical model is provided by robust nature of the bmc model for different spectral states and independence of a specific type of comptonization scenario involved .",
    "the bmc model spectrum is a sum of the blackbody component ( which is the disk radiation directly seen by the observer ) and the fraction of the blackbody component comptonized in the corona with the variable comptonization fraction .",
    "the model has four parameters : @xmath40 is a color temperature of thermal photon spectrum , @xmath15 is the energy spectral index ( @xmath41 , where @xmath10 is the photon index ) , the parameter @xmath42 is related to the weight of the comptonized component , @xmath43 , and a normalization of the blackbody component .",
    "the bmc model is valid for the general case of comptonization when both bulk and thermal motion are included .    for the thermal comptonization @xmath39 is related to electron temperature @xmath44 .",
    "when the bulk motion comptonization is dominant @xmath39 is related to the bulk kinetic energy of the electrons @xmath45 . for the thermal comptonization for energies less than @xmath39",
    "comptt and bmc models are identical .",
    "the thermal comptonization and dynamical ( bulk motion ) comptonization are presumably responsible for the spectral formation in the hard state and the soft state respectively .",
    "therefore , one needs a generic model such as bmc that describes the spectral shape regardless of the specific type of comptonization . although the thermal comptonization model can properly fit the spectral shape for the observed spectra for all spectral states but it would give physically unreasonable values of the best - fit parameters for the soft state spectra",
    "notably , wilms et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show optical depth of compton cloud inferred from comptt model significantly decreases towards high / soft state .",
    "it is very difficult ( in the framework of any reasonable physical model ) to explain tendency when the mass accretion rate increases during the hard - to - soft state transition .",
    "we remind a reader that tsh05 used two bmc components to fit the spectral data from ns source 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "the radiation from the central object and inner parts of accretion disk is comptonized by a surrounding cloud .",
    "as long as the spectral index for each bmc component is a physical characteristic of the comptonizing region , tsh05 used this parameter for each of bmc components describing disk and ns comptonized radiation .",
    "in fact , the bmc xspec model spectrum ( titarchuk et al . 1997 ) is a sum of the ( disk or ns ) black - body component and comptonized black - body component . in the bh case",
    "one can conclude that only one the bmc component is needed in order to describe the comptonization spectrum .",
    "the soft photons generated by the solid surface are absent in this case .",
    "another important issue in modeling the bhc spectra is a proper account for iron fluorescence line at @xmath46 kev .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the iron line observed in cyg x-1 is one of the strongest among bhc sources and is confirmed by various instruments .",
    "the site of the iron line origin is not yet identified and the process of its formation is under debate . currently it is fashionable to explain the iron line in the framework of the reflection model by @xcite ( hereafter mz95 , see pexrav and pexriv models in xspec ) .",
    "the geometry required by the model implies that the source of comptonized component ( exponentially cut - off power law ) is located above a flat reflecting surface ( accretion disk ) .",
    "the appearance of the iron line and so called a reflection hump at 15 - 20 kev is then produced as a result of compton reflection .",
    "despite the fact that reflection model provides a good spectral fits to the data , the best - fit parameters obtained for a soft state are hard to explain ( we provide more details in the discussion section ) . in figure [ bmc_vs_pexrav ]",
    "we compare the fits given by bmc and pexrav models for the observation taken when the source was in the soft state .",
    "the reflection model fit requires an additional gaussian to account for the iron line .",
    "the line profile produced by pexrav alone can not account for the total iron line strength even for high values of a reflection factor @xmath30 .",
    "the large `` reflection '' component , in turn , leads to overestimated spectral indices for the comptonized component .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the line formation is proposed by @xcite , lat04 hereafter . in their scenario",
    "the iron line is formed in outflowing wind material .",
    "it is important to note that an absorption edge is _ physically _ required to compensate for absorption of photons above the k - threshold energy [ see @xcite ] .",
    "our results favor this model as it is consistent with equivalent width ( ew ) - spectral index correlations and is capable of accounting for high ew values . to illustrate our arguments and to investigate the mutual dependence of predicted spectral properties on the specific model we fit the subset of cyg x-1 observations which includes low / hard , soft states and transitions between them .",
    "the models and the results of fits are presented on figure [ models ] .",
    "the power law plus blackbody empirical model and bmc model provide qualitatively similar results when the gaussian is used with the edge and without it .",
    "considering the restricted rxte energy resolution at low energies the exact values of gaussian ews have to be handled with care .",
    "however , statistically the edge is highly significant . in figure",
    "[ counts ] we demonstrate the consistency of the our spectral model using a representative spectrum from cyg x-1 .",
    "for all fits we fix and relate the line energy at 6.4 kev to k threshold energy at 7.1 kev [ see details of this relation in @xcite ] . to account for interstellar absorption",
    "we use a fixed hydrogen column of @xmath47 @xmath5 . finally , according to the above arguments , the xspec model for the spectral fitting reads as _ wabs(gaussian+bmc)*edge_. we use @xmath15 , the disk color temperatures , disk blackbody normalizations as free parameters of the spectral continuum model .",
    "the spectral fits was obtained using 3.5 - 30.0 kev energy range .",
    "we add 0.5% error to the data to account for systematic uncertainty in the pca calibration .",
    "the typical quality of fit is good with @xmath48 in the range of 0.5 - 1.5 .",
    "the evolution of spectral properties of the source during the transition from the low / hard to the soft states is shown on figure [ spevol ] and in table [ statestab ] .",
    "the temperature profile of the thermal ( blackbody ) component is plotted versus the index @xmath10 in figure [ kt ] .",
    "this temperature is presumably related to the disk .",
    "it changes only slightly in the narrow range of 0.5 -0.6 kev and is nearly independent of the spectral state .",
    "when the source is in the low / hard state the emerging radiation spectrum is presumably formed as a result of comptonization of soft photons generated in the disk .",
    "we present a @xmath49- diagram for the low / hard state in upper left hand panel of figure [ spevol ] ( @xmath50 is the energy flux ) . as a source progresses to higher",
    "luminosity states the spectrum becomes softer , the power - law part of the spectrum becomes steeper and the contribution of the blackbody ( thermal ) component increases .",
    "the strength of the iron line also increases ( see the right upper panel in figure [ spevol ] ) .",
    "one can explain this evolution of the spectrum by an increasingly efficient deposition of the gravitational energy in the disk which becomes stronger towards the soft states ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity reaches the highest level in the soft state when the spectral index @xmath10 is about 2 .",
    "the power - law plateau is clearly seen in @xmath49- diagram presented in the lower left hand panel of figure [ spevol ] .",
    "then , as the spectral index increases we observe a slight decrease in flux .",
    "we identify this phase as a very soft state ( the so called  thermal dominated state \" ) , in addition to the canonical low / hard , intermediate and soft states .",
    "the energy spectrum is dominated by thermal component ( more than 70% of total flux ) and the maximum observed spectral index is @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , typically , the high / soft state in the bh sources is observed when an extended power - law component has index @xmath52 [ see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , hereafter brt99 , tf04 ] .",
    "this relatively low index for cyg x-1 soft state can be explained by a higher temperature of the converging flow than that for the high / soft state of other bh sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lt99 , and also tf04 ) . the main reason for this",
    "may be the fact that in the soft state of cyg x-1 , the energy release in the disk and in the compton cloud are comparable while in the typical lmxb bh sources , like grs 1915 + 105 , xte j1550 - 564 , gro 1655 - 40 , in the high / soft state the energy release in the disk is much greater .",
    "when spectral index progresses to values higher than @xmath53 the luminosity decreases ( see the lower right hand panel of figure [ spevol ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we use a terminology for the spectral states in cyg x-1 based on our physical scenario of the spectral evolution there ( see more of the details in the discussion section ) . in our classification",
    "the difference between soft and very soft states corresponds to the difference in the spectral indices . in soft state when the saturation of the spectral index @xmath10 vs qpo frequency @xmath9 occurs , @xmath10 is about 2 ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "whereas in the very soft state the spectra become softer and @xmath10 increases to the values of 2.7 .",
    "no qpo frequencies are observed in this state .    in the scheme of mcclintock and remillard ( 2004 ) ( and every other `` high '' or `` very high state '' bhc sources ) this classification can look different .",
    "one should be careful in applying the definition of spectral states ( particularly soft states ) for some particular source .",
    "the next important question is how this spectral evolution is related to the timing characteristics of the source . in our study of the power density spectrum ( pds ) , we reveal that the pds features , break frequency @xmath13 , and lorentzian low - frequency @xmath9 and q - value of the qpo frequency evolve and increase while the source progresses toward the soft state .",
    "but the qpo frequencies are completely washed out in the very soft state .",
    "@xcite , hereafter tcw02 , predicted that when the source is embedded in the optically thick medium the qpo features must be absent in the pds of the source because of photon scattering .",
    "when the radiation from the central source passes through the surrounding cloud of optical depth @xmath54 and of radius @xmath30 the direct ( unscattered ) and scatterred fractions of the radiation are @xmath55 and [ @xmath56 respectively .",
    "consequently the rms amplitude of the direct component decreases exponentially with @xmath54 .",
    "tcw02 show that the rms amplitude of the scattered component @xmath57 for a given rotational frequency @xmath58 decreases as @xmath59 where @xmath60 ^ 4 + ( 3r\\tau_0\\omega/4c)^2\\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "as seen from equation ( [ bomega ] ) , the qpo amplitude of the radiation scatterred in the wind ( cloud ) decreases very rapidly with @xmath54 and with @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , namely    @xmath63    a radius r of @xmath64 cm was chosen as a typical radius of the wind inferred from the observations [ @xcite ] and theoretically inferred using luminosity and spectrum as observable characteristics of the source [ @xcite ] .",
    "thus we can conclude that the variability of the scatterred part of radiation is completely washed out in the wind of radius of order @xmath64 cm even for @xmath65 .",
    "the variability of the direct ( unscattered ) component is preserved but its rms amplitude decreases as @xmath55 with @xmath54 .",
    "the power spectrum analysis of cyg x-1 data confirms this expectation ( see pottschmidt et 2003 ; axelsson , borgonovo & larsson 2005 and our results in this paper ) .",
    "the power spectrum in the very soft state is featureless ( see fig .",
    "[ power ] ) .",
    "the emission of the central source is presumably obscured by the optically thick wind and consequently all photons emanating from the central source are scattered .",
    "the direct component of the central source radiation that carries information about the variability is suppressed by scattering .",
    "@xcite argue that there is a particular state of cyg x-1 when the wind velocity is very low and thus one can expect high accumulation material in the wind and high optical depth of the wind .",
    "the wind downscattering of the photons emanating from the inner compton cloud leads to the softening of spectrum @xcite and consequently to a decrease in x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "the softening of the spectrum can also be a result of effective cooling the compton cloud by the disk soft photons .",
    "if the power law component of the soft state is formed in the converging flow , then the high indices are a result of the low flow temperature ( lt99 ) .",
    "the index increases and saturates to the critical value about 2.8 with the mass accretion rate for the low temperatures of the flow ( see lt99 and titarchuk & zannias 1998 , hereafter tz98 ) . to calculate the power spectrum of the central source emission affected by scattering one should present the quantitative model of the resulting pulse affected by scattering @xmath66 which can be written as follows : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the input pulse of the central source oscillations and",
    "@xmath69 is the response pulse of the scattering medium .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath66 is a product of the power spectrum of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 where @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    are fourier transforms of @xmath74 respectively .",
    "the time response of the innermost part of the source @xmath68 can be considered in terms of diffusion propagation of perturbation in the disk transition layer ( tl ) .",

    "( see e.g. gcr99 ) used an empirical model in which each source spectrum is a sum of power law spectrum with photon index @xmath10 and a multi - temperature disk blackbody . to this continuum",
    ", a reflection spectrum after mz95 was added .",
    "gcr99 emphasized that this empirical model is an oversimplification and therefore the best - fit parameter values do not necessarily represent the physically meaningful quantities .",
    "gcr99 also showed that the reflection model can properly mimic the reprocessed component of the spectrum . particularly for intermediate and soft states ( when @xmath191 in the reflection modeling ) one can clearly see the high strength in the fluorescent k@xmath3 iron line at 6 - 7 kev and the deep broad smeared iron k - edge at @xmath192 kev ( see figs .",
    "6 - 7 in gcr99 ) .",
    "we confirm gcr99 s conclusions that these line and k - edge edge features are more pronounced towards soft states .",
    "however , we argue that these spectral features are results of reprocessing of the central source hard radiation in the outflow warm absorber ( wind ) that surrounds the central bh .",
    "this our claim is supported by observed qpo power decay towards the softer states that is presumably a result of reprocessing of time signal in the extended relatively warm wind ( see fig [ power ] ) .",
    "recently proga ( 2005 ) and proga & kallman ( 2004 ) demonstrated using the results of hydro simulations , that the disk illumination by the radiation of the central source or just local disk luminosity can launch a wind off the disk photosphere .",
    "they argue that radiation pressure due to uv ( line resonances ) couples the x - ray and uv radiation processes by driving the disk material above the disk where the most part of the x - ray emission of the central source propagates .",
    "a strong disk wind develops when the local disk flux @xmath193 is more than 0.3 @xmath194 . for a less luminous disk",
    "the line force can still force material off the disk but it fails to accelerate the flow to escape velocity .",
    "one should stress that the timing and spectral data do reveal signatures of reprocessed component of the hard radiation in terms of high iron line equivalent width ( about one kev in the soft states ) and broad iron k - edge features .",
    "the strengths of these features seen in the observations strongly exclude their formation by disk reflection .",
    "the highest value of ew due to reflection must be less than 100 ev ( see basko 1978 and george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "in fact , the best - fit values of the reflection scaling factor @xmath195 inferred from the cyg x-1 observations contradict to the basic assumption of the reflection model for which @xmath30 can not be more than 0.25 . as a result of our data analysis",
    "we have also found using the reflection model by mz95 that @xmath30 correlates with spectral index and values of @xmath30 are as high as @xmath196 at @xmath197 ( see fig [ rel_refl ] ) .    in principle , the reflection effect from outer relatively cold parts of the disk would be detected in the low state of the source when the spectrum is relatively hard ( photon index @xmath198 ) . in this case",
    "one can see a reflection hump in the spectrum around 10 - 15 kev ( st80 ) .",
    "the main problem with the detection of this feature along with low ew of the line is that the fraction of reflected emission @xmath169 in the resulting spectrum is about 8% and less , i.e. @xmath199 where @xmath200 is albedo of the cold material ( basko , sunyaev & titarchuk 1974 , titarchuk 1987 ) .",
    "such tiny reflection features will be readily washed out by intervening wind clouds ( see above ) .",
    "the disk reflection effects become much weaker for softer spectra ( states ) , for which photon index more than 2 .",
    "thus the strong iron and k - edge features detected in the soft state are likely not due to reflection from the disk at all .",
    "rather they should be formed in the extended wind clouds surrounding the central black hole .",
    "the relative large time lag observed in the soft state ( see gcr99 ) really corroborate this scenario of reprocessing of the spectrum of the central object in the very extended environment ( wind ) of the source .",
    "mcconnell et al . (",
    "2002 ) using gro / comptel observations of cyg x-1 claim that the high energy tail in the soft state shows no cutoff up to at least 0.5 mev and 10 mev respectively .",
    "they demonstrate that their analysis from batse , osse and comptel show that the combined spectrum can be described by a single power law with a best - fit photon index of @xmath201 . for these particular states",
    "for which @xmath202 _ rxte _ power spectra are featureless ( see fig . [ power ] ) , no qpos are seen in these states .",
    "in fact , grove ( 2005 , private communications ) confirms that osse power spectra of cyg x-1 also do not show any signatures of qpo but only red noise .",
    "it means that in these observations the central bh is not seen directly but through a very extended cloud that ultimately washes out the timing and spectral information of the central object .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the comptel exposure time is about @xmath203 s that is much longer than the spectral formation time near the central black hole(which is of order of crossing time of the innermost part of bh , a few times of @xmath204 s ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical time scale can be longer by two orders of magnitude than the spectral formation time but it is still 7 orders of magnitude shorter than the comptel exposure time .",
    "one can not exclude that the high energy emission detected by comptel is probably not related to central bh , but it can be a result of some other process , for example in the outflow or jets ( see the recent discovery of very high energy gamma rays associated with an x - ray binary ls 5039 in a paper by aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in figure [ index_vs_time ] we present timescale photon index variation for different states in cyg x-1 during @xmath0 8 years of _ rxte _ observations",
    ". in particular , cyg x-1 can be rather stable in the low / hard state for the several months , while it is very dynamic in the soft and very soft states where it changes its spectral index on timescale of a day .",
    "thus cyg x-1 stays in the low / hard with an occasional transition ( once per several years ) to the soft state where the power - law spectrum becomes significantly steeper ( with @xmath187 ) .",
    "also , one or two times per year cyg x-1 exhibits so called `` failed state transions '' , when it starts to transition but does not reach a soft state , stops at some intermediate state and falls back to a hard one .",
