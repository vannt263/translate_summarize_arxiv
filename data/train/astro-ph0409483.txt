    "strong gravitational lensing has emerged as an important tool in the astrophysical toolbelt .",
    "strong lenses have been used , for example , to measure the hubble constant ( e.g * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , to study the properties of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to study dark matter substructure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to resolve the inner structure of quasars @xcite , even to constrain the geometry of the universe @xcite .",
    "many of the applications of strong lensing require reconstructing the gravitational potential of the lens , which includes contributions both from the principal lens galaxy and from any ( projected ) nearby structures .",
    "models of strong lenses often treat the lens galaxy itself in exquisite detail ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however the lens environment is usually treated more simply . except in cases with obvious nearby galaxies",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the environments of lenses are typically modeled simply as tidal shear .",
    "how valid is this approximation ? in some instances , higher order terms in the potential than the @xmath1 term represented by external shear may be required , and @xcite describes quantitatively how to estimate the importance of such terms for a lens model .",
    "additionally , the nearby environment can contribute not only tidal shear , but ( projected ) mass density as well . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "massive ellipticals are biased tracers of the underlying mass density ; we expect massive ellipticals to reside in overdense environments , and indeed , many lens galaxies are found in poor groups or galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite , among others , point out that the environmental mass density , here denoted @xmath2 , can lead to a mass sheet degeneracy in many of the quantities derived from strong lensing analyses .",
    "for instance , the hubble constant inferred from time delays scales as @xmath3 . in the age of precision cosmology , it is clearly important to determine the magnitude of this uncertainty in lens models .    in principle",
    ", our theory of structure formation should already provide an answer to this question . in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , the clustering of mass proceeds largely through the growth and merging of dark matter halos .",
    "assessing the importance of lens environments reduces basically to determining , where ( in which halos ) do lens galaxies live ? placing lens galaxies chiefly in the most massive , biased objects like galaxy clusters will of course enhance the effects of environment , whereas environment will be less important if lenses live in lower mass halos .",
    "we do not have complete freedom to pick the halo occupation distribution of lens galaxies , however : there are now several observational constraints on models for elliptical galaxies and their hosts .",
    "first , galaxy - galaxy lensing @xcite provides direct constraints on the average mass profiles surrounding lens galaxies .",
    "second , choosing a model for the halo occupation distribution of galaxies implicitly makes a prediction for the number density of those galaxies , and there are now precise measurements of the number density of massive elliptical galaxies ( which most strong lenses are ) .",
    "accordingly , we can use these measurements to constrain the hod of lens galaxies , and thereby compute the effects of lens environments .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ halo ] , the number counts of @xcite and the galaxy - galaxy lensing results of @xcite are combined , in the context of the halo model , to constrain the halo occupation distribution of lens galaxies . in ",
    "[ simul ] , this hod is used to populate an n - body simulation with lens galaxies , which is then exploited to make predictions for the effects of lens environments .",
    "@xcite explain in detail how the halo model may be used to compute the number density and average surface density ( and shear ) profiles around galaxies .",
    "as they discuss , the galaxy - convergence angular correlation function may be computed by projecting the 3-d galaxy - mass power spectrum using the @xcite approximation , @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the volume number density of lens galaxies as a function of redshift , @xmath6 is the projected angular number density of lens galaxies , @xmath7 is the comoving angular diameter distance , and @xmath8 are the angular diameter distances from lens to source and from observer to source , respectively .",
    "the halo model enters by providing a prescription for the galaxy - mass power spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "the ingredients are models for the dark matter halo mass function @xmath10 , the halo bias @xmath11 , the halo density profile @xmath12 , and the halo occupation distribution of galaxies . for dm halos",
    ", we use the mass function and bias prescription of @xcite , the density profile of @xcite , and halo concentrations of @xcite .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) specifies how galaxies populate dm halos . @xcite",
    "present a model for the hod based upon n - body simulations . in their model ,",
    "the mean number of galaxies ( say , brighter than luminosity @xmath13 ) residing in halos of mass @xmath14 has two pieces , @xmath15 , corresponding to central galaxies and satellite galaxies .",
    "they find that @xmath16 is well fit by a step function , @xmath17 where the parameter @xmath18 is the minimum mass halo capable of hosting a central galaxy with the required properties ( e.g.  luminosity ) .",
    "@xcite  also find that the satellite term is well described by a poisson distribution with mean @xmath19 for @xmath20 and zero otherwise .",
    "the halo mass function and hod together specify the predicted galaxy volume number density , viz @xmath21 similarly , the halo model expression for the galaxy - mass power spectrum becomes , in the notation of @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 \\frac{dn_h}{dm } b(m ) \\\\",
    "i_{2c}(k ) & = & { \\bar n}_v^{\\,-1 } \\int dm \\frac{m}{\\rho_m}\\ , \\left[\\frac{dn_h}{dm}\\,({\\bar n}_c y_h+{\\bar n}_s y_h y_g)\\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.\\qquad + \\frac{dn_s}{dm } \\theta(m - m_{\\rm th } ) y_s\\right ] , \\label{i2c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 is the normalized fourier transform of the dm density profile , @xmath25 and similarly @xmath26 is the normalized fourier transform of the satellite galaxy distribution within halos , here assumed to track the mass , so that @xmath27 .",
    "note that the redshift - dependent concentration is implicitly included in the density profile @xmath28 .",
    "the satellite mass function is given by @xmath29    the observables to match are the number density and tangential shear profile .",
    "[ num ] gives the predicted number density , while the predicted shear profile is given by @xmath30 strong gravitational lenses tend to be massive elliptical galaxies , and @xcite report the average shear profile of elliptical galaxies with velocity dispersion @xmath31 km / s observed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . @xcite",
    "have measured the velocity dispersion function of sdss ellipticals , and found it to be well fit by a schechter - type function . for ellipticals with @xmath31 km / s ,",
    "their fit gives a total number density of @xmath32 . also , the mean squared velocity dispersion for this sample is @xmath33 . for a lens at @xmath34 and source at @xmath35",
    ", this would correspond to an einstein radius of @xmath36 , in good agreement with typical lens splittings .",
    "the ingredients are now in place to find the hod parameters which best fit the observed data on massive ellipticals .",
    "this hod will be used in the next section to populate halos found in an n - body simulation , so it is important that consistent definitions of halo mass are used for the halo model calculation and the group finder , the friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath37 . @xcite",
    "have found that fof with @xmath37 corresponds well to halo overdensity of 180 , and that the sheth - tormen mass function provides a good fit to the mass function if the halo mass is defined not as the virial mass , but as @xmath38 , i.e.  the mass enclosed within radius @xmath39 for which the average interior density is 180 times the mean matter density @xmath40 . the @xcite model for halo concentrations",
    "is given in terms of the virial mass , not @xmath41 which is typically @xmath42 larger than @xmath43 .",
    "given the nfw density profile , it would not be difficult to translate from @xmath41 to @xmath43 @xcite , but the dependence of concentration on mass is so weak ( @xmath44 ) that this distinction is ignored here .",
    "the hod used here has three parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ hodpars ] shows likelihood contours in the @xmath47 plane , for @xmath48 , assuming a 10% uncertainty for the number density @xmath49 .",
    "other values of @xmath18 gave significantly poorer fits , so @xmath50 will be assumed throughout . as can be seen from the figure , a broad region in the @xmath47 plane , centered on @xmath51 , @xmath52 provides reasonable fits to the data .",
    "these values compare reasonably well to hod parameters derived by @xcite from hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models . the satellite fraction for these hod parameters",
    "is roughly 25% , in good agreement with the estimates of @xcite .",
    "there appears to be a mild degeneracy between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in the sense that increasing @xmath45 ( which lowers the fraction of lens galaxies that are satellites ) may be compensated by increasing @xmath46 ( which places satellites in more massive groups ) to hold fixed the tangential shear profile ; see fig .",
    "[ avekap ] for an example .",
    "however note that large @xmath46 is likely disfavored by measurements of the multiplicity function in clusters @xcite .",
    "one defect which has been glossed over so far is that the sdss data on elliptical galaxies used to constrain the hod parameters extend to redshifts @xmath53 , much less than typical lens redshifts @xmath54 . in order to apply this hod to the lens population",
    ", it must be assumed that there is little evolution in massive ellipticals between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "note that the average @xmath2 may be calculated using these hod parameters using just the halo model , by keeping only the term in @xmath9 corresponding to the correlation between satellite galaxies and mass in their parent halos : @xmath57 this somewhat underestimates @xmath2 , because in this formalism halo profiles extend only out to @xmath39 , whereas in reality there is mass overdensity extending well beyond this radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this caveat in mind , applying eqn .",
    "[ kgroup ] gives an average @xmath58 .",
    "as noted above , fractional errors in ( e.g. ) the hubble constant will be @xmath59 , implying that estimates of the hubble constant which ignore the group convergence make @xmath60 errors for most lens systems , which is still small compared to other systematics .",
    "the halo occupation distribution from the previous section can now be used to populate halos from an n - body simulation with lens galaxies , to compute the distribution of lens environments .",
    "a small ( by modern standards ) dissipationless simulation with @xmath61 particles in a 256 @xmath62mpc box was run using the tpm codebode / tpm ] @xcite for a wmap cosmology with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "initial conditions were generated using the grafic1 code @xcite , for a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum ( @xmath66 ) and present - day amplitude @xmath67 .",
    "the particle mass for this simulation was @xmath68 , so that halos of mass @xmath69 contained 42 particles .",
    "since the simulation was dissipationless , @xmath70 was assumed for generating the initial conditions .    the @xmath34 output from this simulation",
    "was then populated with lens galaxies using the best fitting hod from the previous section , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "first , the friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath37 was used to find halos in the simulation .",
    "central galaxies were placed at the most bound particles in these halos .",
    "the number of satellites for each halo was determined by generating random numbers from a poisson distribution with mean given by eqn .",
    "satellite galaxies were assigned the positions of randomly selected particles in each halo , to match the assumption above that the satellite distribution follows the dm distribution .",
    "next , convergence and shear ( assuming a source redshift @xmath35 ) were computed at the galaxy positions by projecting the particle data along three orthogonal axes . for central galaxies , the contribution from the galaxies own halos",
    "must be removed in order to compute solely environmental effects .",
    "this was accomplished by excluding , for each galaxy , all particles in its halo ( as defined by fof ) when computing the projected convergence . applying this method for shear",
    "would be computationally onerous , since the shear is computed by repeated fourier transforms of the full convergence map . instead , to compute the environmental shear at each central galaxy , comoving 100 @xmath62kpc cavities were excised around each galaxy .",
    "this truncated particle list was then projected to make a convergence map with comoving 31.25 @xmath62 kpc resolution , which was then fourier transformed to produce shear maps of the same resolution .",
    "the resulting shear values at the galaxy positions were mildly dependent upon the precise cavity radius ; using comoving 50 @xmath62kpc cavities instead of 100 @xmath62kpc cavities gave shear values @xmath74 larger . for satellite galaxies , no such excision of particles",
    "was required , because the satellites were placed randomly inside their parent groups , not on subhalos .",
    "the resulting histogram of @xmath2 and @xmath75 values is plotted in figure  [ histo ] .",
    "there are a few points to note .",
    "first , the mean values of convergence and shear are similar , with @xmath76 .",
    "this agrees roughly with the simple halo model estimate for @xmath77 given in the previous section . while the @xmath75 histogram appears well described by a lognormal distribution , the @xmath2 histogram exhibits extended tails .",
    "an interesting related question is that of the frequency of high @xmath2 or @xmath75 . in these simulations",
    ", @xmath78 occurred with roughly @xmath79 probability , while @xmath80 had @xmath81 probability .",
    "one difficulty in making these estimates is that the tails of the @xmath2 and @xmath75 distributions are likely overrepresented , due to projections .",
    "galaxies which project near unrelated massive groups will appear to have higher @xmath2 and @xmath75 than is truly representative for their own environments .",
    "similarly , galaxies which project near voids will have overly low @xmath2 .",
    "of course , from the viewpoint of estimating errors on derived quantities like the hubble constant , such projections are just as important to consider as the immediate environment of the lenses .",
    "one last point to consider is that selection effects can modify the probability distributions for @xmath2 and @xmath75 for actual lenses compared to the distributions computed here .",
    "for example , the strong lensing cross section scales as @xmath82 , so in principle the histograms of convergence and shear should be weighted by this factor @xcite . reweighting the distributions ( excluding the tiny fraction of galaxies with @xmath83 )",
    ", the average @xmath77 increases to 0.037 , while @xmath84 increases to 0.033 .",
    "another possible selection effect is that ellipticals with higher velocity dispersion ( and hence larger lensing cross section @xmath85 ) will tend to live in more massive , more biased halos , and so the @xmath86 and @xmath87 histograms should be weighted by this factor as well for lenses .",
    "unfortunately , this requires a more detailed halo occupation distribution than has been used here .",
    "this paper has presented a calculation of the effects of the environments surrounding lens galaxies .",
    "lens galaxies were placed in an n - body simulation using a halo occupation distribution calibrated to match both the number density and tangential shear profiles observed for massive elliptical galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the sdss results are measured for galaxies at low redshift , @xmath88 , while lens galaxies are typically at higher redshift , @xmath89 , so the results presented here will be meaningful only if there is little evolution in elliptical galaxies between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the expected average values for convergence and shear are @xmath76 , with a spread of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in @xmath94 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "values much higher than the mean appear relatively rarely , with @xmath78 occurring with @xmath95 probability and @xmath96 occurring with @xmath81 probability .",
    "previous work has considered related topics .",
    "both @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hs ) have estimated the magnitude of tidal shear produced by material correlated with lens galaxies .",
    "this paper has followed an approach quite similar to that developed by hs .",
    "the results presented here appear similar to those of @xcite , however hs find somewhat higher environmental shear .",
    "this appears to be due to a different hod ; hs use massive elliptical galaxies produced using the semi - analytic recipes of @xcite .",
    "as they note , their lens galaxies tend to live in very massive halos , with roughly @xmath97 residing in clusters more massive than @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , the number density of massive elliptical galaxies predicted by hs is lower than the values computed here by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "further observations of the environments surrounding lens galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can help determine whether lenses typically do reside in such massive halos .",
    "recently , @xcite have investigated the importance of the group convergence on strong lenses .",
    "they construct a mock group including several supercritical galaxies separated by a few einstein radii . by explicit construction",
    ", they showed that in cases like these , @xmath2 can approach @xmath99 , which would dramatically skew the results of analyses ignoring group convergence .",
    "clearly , for systems like these , it is necessary to model such close neighbors using both convergence and shear , and indeed in systems like pg 1115 + 080 the nearby groups are modeled with isothermal spheres or nfw profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the majority of systems",
    ", however , the environment is treated merely with tidal shear , and the results of this paper indicate that such a treatment is usually adequate .",
    "if typical @xmath2 at lens galaxies is @xmath81 , then errors in the hubble constant will similarly be at the @xmath81 level , which is still unimportant compared to the @xmath100 systematic errors typical of lensing @xmath101 s .",
    "one remaining puzzle from this work is the origin of the large shears measured at lens galaxies . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "successful models of strong lenses typically require external shear at the level of @xmath102 , considerably higher than the @xmath103 found here .",
    "such shear can not be explained by uncorrelated structure ( e.g. line - of - sight projections ) , which should produce shear of order the cosmic shear , @xmath104 on these scales .",
    "hs have argued that such strong shear naturally occurs for lenses living in massive systems like galaxy clusters where @xmath105 . on the other hand , @xcite   have suggested that much of this so - called external shear originates in the halos of the lens galaxies themselves .",
    "to support this idea , they note that the total quadrupole at the images aligns quite well with the galaxy orientation , while misalignments larger than observed would arise if @xmath106 external shear were completely uncorrelated with the galaxy orientation ( see * ? ? ? * for an updated version of this ) . as noted by holder ( 2003 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , however , this argument has difficulty .",
    "halo material stratified on ellipses with the same ellipticity as the mass interior to the einstein ring will produce no effect on the lens images , as shown by newton . for the halo to produce this shear , it must either have principal axes substantially twisted relative to the galaxy principal axes , or it must have a very different ellipticity . to illustrate , imagine taking an isothermal ellipsoid with einstein radius @xmath107 , and beyond some radius @xmath108 , either twisting the ellipsoidal axes by some angle @xmath109 or changing the ellipticity by @xmath110 .",
    "then the change in shear at the einstein radius , in the limit @xmath111 , will be of order @xmath112 where typical lens einstein radii are @xmath113 and typical ellipticities are @xmath114 . @xcite have found that galaxies and their extended halos align quite well , with halo ellipticities on average @xmath115 the observed galaxy ellipticity , which limits @xmath116 .",
    "this casts doubt on a halo origin for observed external shear ; @xmath117 would be required to produce enough shear in this way .",
    "therefore , dramatic changes in the density structure must occur in lens galaxies just outside their einstein radii , near the transition between baryon - domination to dm - domination , for the lenses themselves to account for the observed shear . on the other hand ,",
    "halo substructure conceivably could account for some of the unexplained shear @xcite .",
