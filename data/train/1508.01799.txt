    "if the superconducting gap @xmath12 is small with respect to the relevant energy scales of the system , i.e. , if @xmath245 , [ eq : pfaffianexpansion3 ] can be further simplified . in this case , since @xmath66 , higher order fourier coefficients can be safely neglected , and one obtains @xmath246 , which leads to [ eq : pfaffianlimit ] , i.e. , @xmath247 $ ] . in this approximation , it can be easily shown using trigonometric identities that the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath248 are given by @xmath249 where @xmath69 is any angle .",
    "the phase - shift of the pfaffian @xmath27 in [ eq : lambdatheta ] is related to the phase - inversion symmetry in the system . if the soc or the magnetic field vanish , the system is invariant under phase - inversion symmetry , i.e. , @xmath250 and @xmath251 , which mandates @xmath84 in [ eq : lambdatheta ] .",
    "this invariance is related to the magnetic mirror symmetry operator@xcite @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the spin mirror reflection across the @xmath88 plane and @xmath89 the time - reversal operator . in general , the only terms in the bdg hamiltonian  [ eq : bdghamiltonian ] which are affected by complex conjugation are the order parameter term , the rashba soc @xmath252 , and the term in the magnetic field component @xmath253 . however , if @xmath90 , the only complex terms of the hamiltonian  [ eq : bdghamiltonian ] are those in the phase @xmath14 and in the magnetic field component @xmath253 . in this case , since the choice of the quantization axis is arbitrary , one can always choose the @xmath1 axis in the direction of the applied magnetic field . on the other hand ,",

    ", the fourier coefficients in [ eq : pfaffianexpansion0 ] transforms under complex conjugation as @xmath258 which mandates @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic mirror symmetry @xmath53 corresponds to the inversion of the phase - shift of the pfaffian @xmath99 in [ eq : pfaffianlimit ] and , as a consequence , the pfaffian is no longer invariant under phase - inversion @xmath45 alone , but is still invariant under the more general transformation @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath260 .",
    "there is a close relationship between the topological invariant in 0d ( finite - sized system ) , i.e. , the fermion parity of the groundstate @xmath37 , and the topological invariant in 1d ( continuous limit ) , i.e. , the majorana number@xcite @xmath261 . in a system with closed boundary conditions ,",

    "from [ eq : pfaffian1d ] follows immediately that the majorana number @xmath261 coincides with the fermion parity in a system with closed boundary conditions . in a system with open boundary conditions instead ,",
    "a similar relationship can be obtained by considering the crossover between open and close boundaries via a weak link at the edge of the system .",
    "in systems with particle - hole symmetry , the andreev spectrum is particle - hole symmetric , and one has @xmath265= \\prod_{e_i}\\!e_i(\\varphi)= \\prod_{e_i\\ge0}\\!e_i(\\varphi)^2 .",

    "therefore , the lowest order @xmath103 of the non - zero terms in the pfaffian expansion in the phase near the gapless point is half the total multiplicity , i.e. , @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the number of zero - energy modes @xmath24 .",

    "a necessary condition for this case ( @xmath114 and @xmath274 ) is the lifting of the spin degeneracy , due to the broken time - reversal symmetry . if @xmath118 ( @xmath275 ) instead , there is no constraint in general on the phase - dispersion of zero - energy modes , which may be linear ( @xmath276 ) or non - linear ( @xmath277 ) .",
