    "the kohn - sham ( ks)@xcite density functional theory ( dft)@xcite is one of the most powerful techniques in electronic structure calculations .",
    "however , the exact form of the exchange - correlation functional is still unknown and , in practice , one must use approximations .",
    "the accuracy of the predictions of the properties depends on how one approximates this functional .",
    "the simplest one is the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) in which one uses the properties of the uniform electron gas locally @xcite .",
    "this approximation is in principle appropriate for systems in which the variations of the spin densities @xmath3 are sufficiently slow . for finite systems and surfaces which are highly inhomogeneous , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite is more appropriate . in spite of the success of the lsda and gga",
    ", it is observed that in some cases these approximations fail to predict even qualitatively correct behaviors@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , appropriate self - interaction corrected versions of these approximations are observed to lead to correct behaviors@xcite .",
    "these observations motivates one to use functionals in which the self - interaction contribution is removed exactly .",
    "one of the functionals , which satisfies this constraint , is the exact exchange ( eex ) orbital dependent functional . using the eex functional leads to the correct asymptotic behavior of the ks potential as well as to correct results for the high density limit in which the exchange energy is dominated @xcite .",
    "although neglecting the correlation effects in orbital dependent functionals fails to reproduce the dispersion forces such as the van der waals forces@xcite , the eex in some respects is advantageous over the local and semi - local approximations@xcite . to obtain the local exchange potential from the orbital dependent functional",
    ", one should solve the optimized effective potential ( oep ) integral equation .",
    "recently , kmmel and perdew @xcite have invented an iterative method which allows one to solve the oep integral equation accurately and efficiently even for three dimensional systems .",
    "this method is used in this work .    to simplify the cluster problem ,",
    "one notes that the properties of alkali metals are dominantly determined by the delocalized valence electrons . in these metals ,",
    "the fermi wavelengths of the valence electrons are much larger than the metal lattice constants and the pseudo - potentials of the ions do not significantly affect the electronic structure .",
    "this fact allows one to replace the discrete ionic structure by a homogeneous positive charge background which is called jellium model ( jm ) . in its simplest form ,",
    "one applies the jm to metal clusters by replacing the ions of an @xmath4-atom cluster with a sphere of uniform positive charge density and radius @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the valence of the atom and @xmath7 is the bulk value of the wigner - seitz ( ws ) radius for valence electrons@xcite . assuming the spherical geometry is justified only for closed - shell clusters which is the subject in this work .",
    "however , it is a known fact that the jm has some drawbacks@xcite .",
    "the stabilized jellium model ( sjm ) in its original form@xcite was the first attempt to overcome the deficiencies of the jm and still keeping the simplicity of the jm .",
    "application of the sjm to simple metals and metal clusters has shown significant improvements over the jm results@xcite . however , for small metal clusters the surface effects are important and the cluster is self - compressed due to its surface tension .",
    "this effect has been successfully taken into account by the sjm which is called sjm with self - compression ( sjm - sc)@xcite .",
    "application of the lsda - sjm - sc to neutral metal clusters has shown that the equilibrium @xmath7 values of small clusters are smaller than their bulk counterparts and approaches to it for very large clusters .",
    "this trend is consistent with the results of _ ab . initio .",
    "_ calculations@xcite .    in this work",
    "we have used the eex - sjm - sc to obtain the equilibrium sizes and energies of closed - shell neutral @xmath4-electron clusters of al , li , na , k , and cs for @xmath4=2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 34 , and 40 ( for al , @xmath4 = 18 corresponds to al@xmath8 cluster and other values do not correspond to a real al@xmath9 ) . in order to have an estimate for the self - interaction effects ,",
    "we have repeated the calculations for exchange - only local spin density approximation ( x - lsda ) in which the spin - polarized version of the dirac form , @xmath10 , is used .",
    "comparison of the results shows that ( except for @xmath11 in al case ) the relation @xmath12 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we explain the calculational schemes .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the results of our calculations and finally , we conclude this work in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in this section we first explain how to implement the exact exchange in the sjm , and then will explain the procedure for the oep calculations .      as in the original sjm@xcite , here",
    "the ashcroft empty core pseudo - potential@xcite is used for the interaction of an ion of charge @xmath6 with an electron at a relative distance @xmath13 : @xmath14 the core radius , @xmath15 , will be fixed by setting the pressure of the bulk system equal to zero . in the eex - sjm ,",
