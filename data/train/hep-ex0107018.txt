    "the kloe electromagnetic calorimeter@xcite was designed to detect photons in the ( 20 - 500 ) mev energy range with good time resolution , so its performances have been taken as guidelines in the design of the pep - n electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "this detector can provide a fast and unbiased first level trigger , with high acceptance for final states with low energy photons.a good k@xmath3 separation is achievable and also some kind of @xmath4 discrimination is possible .",
    "the kloe calorimeter is a fine sampling lead and scintillating fibers calorimeter .",
    "the barrel modules have trapezoidal cross section , 4.3 m long , 60 cm wide and 23 cm thick .",
    "each module is obtained gluing 0.5  mm thick lead foils worked to house the 1  mm diameter fibers .",
    "the resulting structure ( fig .",

    "a precision in measuring the photon conversion point in the transverse plane of @xmath11 cm has been achieved.the coordinate along the fiber is measured using the relation : z = v@xmath12 , with @xmath13 the time difference at the two module ends and @xmath14 the effective light propagation speed in the fibers .",

    "the calorimeter is inside a 0.6 t magnetic field with a consequent residual magnetic field up to 0.2 t in the photomultipliers ( pm ) area and with an angle with respect to pm axis up to 25@xmath19 ; for this reason fine mesh photomultipliers , hamamatsu r5946 , were specially designed for kloe .",
