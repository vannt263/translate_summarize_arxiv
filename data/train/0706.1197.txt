    "the discovery of the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite has generated a lot of excitement in the last few years .",
    "it turns out that this unexpected behaviour can be modeled in many ways , most simply through a cosmological constant . on the other hand",
    "it has been argued that , since this behaviour appears on large scales , the acceleration of the universe is due to some modification of gravity on such scales .",
    "there are quite a few models which can describe such modifications of gravity , such as scalar - tensor theories @xcite-@xcite , the so called @xmath0 theories @xcite-@xcite ( which are a subset of scalar tensor theories ) , brane world models of which randall - sundrum models @xcite and dgp models @xcite are special cases , and some more complicated function of curvature invariants , such as @xmath1 @xcite where @xmath2 represents the gauss - bonnet combination defined as @xmath3 .",
    "modifying gravity in a consistent way is not an easy task , hence many of these models face quite stringent theoretical bounds which can reduce the parameter space of these theories . in the same way one can try to use data to restrict further the parameter space and",
    "possibly rule out some of these models .    in this paper",
    "we study @xmath4 and @xmath5 models , most generally , without specifying any explicit form for these functions . in the @xmath4 case , we consider both the metric based , and the palatini formalisms .",
    "we use the recent expansion history of the universe , reconstructed allowing the hubble parameter to be a free function in redshift bins , using type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data together with relevant contraints from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and galaxy surveys , and invert this to obtain constraints on the parameters of the @xmath4 models .",
    "this perspective has not been adopted before .",
    "although it is similar in nature to the reconstruction of the quintessence potential @xcite , here the scalar degrees of freedom come entirely from the gravity sector .",
    "much work has been dedicated to the subject of constraining @xmath4 theories using solar system measurements @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we will not study this here for several reasons .",
    "first , as believed by some ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the cosmological parameters may be different from those measured locally , because as the background changes from a locally spherically symmetric metric to a homogeneous and isotropic one , the behaviour of quantities such as the coefficients of a taylor - expansion of @xmath4 might be quite different .",
    "second , for this theory locally ( at the solar system scale ) the weak field approximation may not hold , so that it can not be matched to a perturbation of gr ; i.e. , the usual constraints can not be trivially applied because these are found by assuming the metric to be a perturbation about the gr - schwarzschild solution @xcite .",
    "furthermore we are restricting our study to the background evolution at low redshifts , assuming gr - like behaviour until then .",
    "we are not taking into account perturbations and their evolution , nor considering the stability of modes in the early universe , in constraining the models .",
    "these relevant issues have been studied in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the general metric based @xmath4 case and its solutions . in section",
    "iii we discuss the palatini formalism and its solutions . in section iv we consider the generalization including the gauss - bonnet term .",

    "then , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "evaluated today this equation becomes @xmath13 + \\gamma\\ , \\frac{r_0'}{h_0 ^ 2 } = \\frac{8    \\pi g}{3h_0 ^ 2}\\ , \\rho_0\\ , \\label{fried2}\\ ] ] where an underscore 0 implies present values , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the dimension - less parameters of this theory .",
    "since we have three parameters to solve for , we need three equations .",
    "these are obtained by differentiating the friedmann equation twice .",
    "the equations then involve higher derivatives of @xmath11 evaluated today ( in this case upto four ) .    assuming that @xmath17 can be taylor - expanded in @xmath6 about today and retaining only up to the second order terms ( this being the simplest non - trivial case ) , @xmath18 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\hspace{0.25em } f_{rr 0 } \\hspace{0.25em } h_0 ^ 4    \\left [ \\frac{r - r_0}{h_0 ^ 2 } \\right]^{\\ ! 2}\\ , .",
    "\\label{frtaylor}\\ ] ] in order to use the equations of motion effectively one needs to truncate the taylor expansion at some order , otherwise one would need an infinite number of equations , obtained from repeatedly differentiating the friedmann equation , to specify an infinite number of parameters , the taylor coefficients .",
    "we chose to truncate this expansion of @xmath4 at second order because stability constraints on these theories involve @xmath19 and @xmath20 terms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the @xmath31 s of the mcmc chain elements are then converted into the derivatives of @xmath32 , as described in appendix a. the top panel of fig 1 shows the constraints thus derived on what we for convenience shall sometimes refer to as the `` initial parameters '' . from the mcmc chains now we can obtain constraints on @xmath33 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 using the equations derived above .",

    "small changes in these parameters can have a large effect on the values of the @xmath4 parameters , so that a relatively small number of high likelihood combinations of the initial parameters can lead to a large range of values for the @xmath4 parameters .",
    "this leads to flat 1d parameter likelihood curves .",
    "this effect is suppressed in the mcmc posterior of the @xmath4 parameters , because in addition to the likelihood this takes into account the number of samples that fall into each bin . in other words",

    "in addition to the analysis presented here , at the moment , other considerations ( convergence to gr - like evolution at early times , instabilities ) are still the most serious issues that these theories need to survive .",
    "for example , it is known that some models for @xmath4 and @xmath5 do not have a frw background consistent with gr at early times @xcite .",
    "furthermore at high - redshift gr - like models may lead to unstable behaviour in the evolution of perturbations , because of the existence of either a tachionic mode or a mode with imaginary speed of propagation @xcite .",
    "such considerations will further constrain the parameter space of the models considered here . in this paper",
    "we have also not considered solar system type constraints , for reasons discussed in the introduction .    to conclude , we have used current data to place constraints on the first and second derivatives of general functions of the ricci and the gauss - bonnet scalars , under different formalisms .",
    "these derivatives are important quantities for theoretical considerations relating to ghosts and instabilities .",
    "next generation dark energy surveys @xcite can measure the cosmic expansion history much more precisely ; this would dramatically shrink the presently allowed parameter space of the modified gravity models considered here .",
