    "the edge @xmath674 leaving the interior concentration derives directly the function @xmath583 .",
    "the case of a @xmath365-type graph is not acceptable as a possible @xmath675 for the following reason : the colored edge @xmath304 leaving a @xmath365-type graph will in that case derive directly the function @xmath583 on the vertical axis , so the edge @xmath674 of @xmath681 will have nothing to derive . as we saw before we have another possiblity for @xmath681 , namely having @xmath682-type graphs .",

    "the simplest concentration is to have the type i vertex of @xmath699 collapsing to the horizontal axis , and to have no other type i vertices for the exterior graph .",
    "the resulting graph is @xmath700 , the situation before the collapse is depicted in fig .",
    "[ graph degree 1 ] .",
    "so the first term in the left hand sum of equation ( [ stokes ] ) is @xmath701 .",
    "it can be computed ( see  @xcite lemma 3.7 ) that @xmath702 is a nonzero number and in particular @xmath703 .",
    "thus this term equals @xmath704 where @xmath705 .",
    "when we have in total two type ii vertices , then one has the following possible concentrations : first , to have as the interior graph the graph @xmath699 collapsing to the horizontal axis and as exterior , the graph @xmath706 .",
    "the second possible case is to collapse the graph @xmath707 at the horizontal axis , and have again @xmath700 as the exterior graph .",
    "these situations give the summand @xmath708 at the left hand side of ( [ stokes ] ) .",
    "following the previous calculation , this term is @xmath709 , the new coefficient being @xmath710 , if we put the root of the @xmath711 graph in first position , the edge leaving the root and deriving the axis in first position , and the edge @xmath304 in first position with respect to the edges leaving the second vertex .",
    "computing the possible concentrations for larger numbers of type i vertices , one gets inductively the sum at the left hand side of ( [ stokes ] ) .",
    "this sum can be grouped in nice terms if we take in mind the parameter @xmath7 for each type i vertex .",
    "in fact one can write homogeneous equations with respect to the total @xmath712 degree . if the total graph derives the function @xmath713 , in differential operator terms , the equation ( [ stokes ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath714    @xmath715    [ graph 2 first ]     and @xmath716.,width=302 ]    for @xmath717 , the only term is @xmath718 as it is clear from fig .",

    "induction on @xmath340 will give , as ( [ degree 1 ] ) , ( [ degree 2 ] ) , ( [ degree 3 ] ) suggest ,    @xmath734    thus for @xmath735 the stokes equation ( [ first stokes ] ) produces the reduction equations for @xmath595 , that is @xmath736 .",
