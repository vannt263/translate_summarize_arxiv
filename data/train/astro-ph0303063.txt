    "the mass donating companion is most likely an early wolf - rayet star @xcite with an intense stellar wind evidenced by both infrared @xcite and  @xcite lines .",

    "_ chandra _  has observed  with the spectroscopy array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer / high energy transmission grating ( acis - s / hetg ) on four occasions for the purposes of studying the wolf - rayet wind @xcite , measuring the source distance @xcite , and searching for emission lines from the radio jets .",
    "the observations were made in 1999 october and december and in 2000 april ( see table  [ t : obs ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : asm ] puts the _ chandra _  observations in the context of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ all sky monitor cyg  x-3 light curve .",
    "the  flux exhibits a strong bimodal behavior , alternating between extended periods below 10 and above 20cps .",
    "observations 101 + 1456a and 1456b occurred during a transition to and in a low state , respectively , while 425 and 426 were during the high state . since the scattering halo is proportional to the recent point source flux , the high state observations have much brighter halo emission which is effectively a background for the detection of extended structure .    in our analysis of these observations",
    ", we used the ciao tools version 2.2 .",
    "the archival data were processed with ascds versions r4cu5upd9 ( 101 , 1456 ) and 6.3.1 ( 425 , 426 ) .      for each observation",
    ", we extracted the zeroth order image binned at the nominal acis - s resolution ( 0.49 ) . figure  [ f : image ] shows the total image from all four observations . in each individual image",
    ", there is a bright , unresolved core surrounded by a strong scattering halo @xcite and the point spread function ( psf ) wings . in each case",
    ", there is also significant ( 10@xmath1 ) excess emission to the ne ( position angle , pa75 ) of the point source .",
    "the farthest extent from the core is 18 , corresponding to 2.7@xmath2lyr where @xmath2 is the distance in units of 10kpc .",
    "it is also clearly extended , by about 5(0.8@xmath2lyr ) , orthogonal to the core direction . as a fiducial location for the extension , its brightest point , near the center of the outermost arc , lies at ra=20@xmath3 32@xmath4 27@xmath5.1 , dec=@xmath640  57  33.5  ( j2000 ) .",
    "we are confident the extension is real , as it appears at the same sky location in each observation , even though the observations were made at very different roll angles ( see table  [ t : obs ] ) .",
    "this rules out instrumental artifacts , such as psf asymmetries , which would move with the roll angle .",
    "figure  [ f : image ] also shows the profile of three slices through the point source .",
    "although the point source is piled up , resulting in lost counts on axis , a clear extension is seen 16  off axis in two of the slices .",
    "the third , which avoids the extension , is shown for comparison .",
    "furthermore , there is some evidence for a sw extension oppositely directed along slice 1 . neither",
    "feature is aligned with the acis readout streak or dispersed grating spectra in any of the observations .",
    "it is not clear whether the ne extension is connected to the point source or not .",
    "apparent in the image is a `` bridge '' of emission stretching from the ne extension toward the point source .",
    "the two slices suggest that this bridge could simply be the scattering halo , which shows modest azimuthal variations at most radii . however , if this bridge is associated with the extension , then there is evidence of substructure , since it appears brighter around the periphery with relatively weak emission in the center .    finally ,",
    "the milliarcsecond scale radio jets are almost north - south aligned , with pa=175  @xcite , nearly , but not quite , perpendicular to the  extension .      in order to search for any connection between the point source emission and that of the ne extension",
    ", we extracted grating spectra of the point source and ccd spectra of the extension from all four observations .",
    "this allowed us to look for correlated time variability and spectral similarities .",
    "for the extended emission , we used segments of annuli taken at the same radial distance from the point source for source and background regions .",
    "table  [ t : rates ] lists rates , fluxes , and spectral parameters from fits to absorbed black body and power law models .",
    "for the point source , which has strong , variable lines from the stellar wind @xcite , we included the six or seven most prominent lines as required for each observation in order to achieve an acceptable chi - squared .",
    "good fits were achieved with both models .",
    "the resulting  values gave no preference between the two , except for the core source in observations 425 and 426 where a black body was somewhat preferred .",
    "within each observation , the extension flux was consistent with a constant .",
    "the flux was also unchanged between observations 425 and 426 , which were separated by two days .",
    "we therefore have no evidence of variability on less than day times .",
    "however , the point source and scattering halo did brighten by a factor of seven between observations 1456b and 425 ( separated by four months ) , while the extension count rate only increased by about a factor of 2.5 .",
    "this implies that the emission is not simply reprocessed / scattered point source flux ( see  [ s : disc ] ) . in any event ,",
    "given the apparent size ( 0.8lyr ) of the extended region , it is somewhat surprising to observe such strong variability in just four months .",
    "this hints that there may be significant underlying substructure . unfortunately , because of limited statistics , we can not determine if the extension spectrum changed , although the 1999 spectra are marginally harder than those in 2000 .",
    "any model of the extended emission must explain the observed morphology , time variability , luminosity , and spectrum .",
    "we consider several possible origins : scattering in a non - axisymmetric dust halo , a coincidental alignment of an unrelated source , reflection from the companion s stellar wind , bremsstrahlung from the disk wind , and collision of historical jets with the ism .",
    "one possibility is that a non - uniform distribution of dust around the line of sight could result in enhanced , asymmetric halo emission . in this case",
    ", the spectrum and flux should follow closely the point source spectrum with only a short ( @xmath7days ) delay . however , the extension flux varied only by a factor of 2.5 over the observations , while the point source and the bulk of the halo varied by a factor of seven .",
    "also , the black body temperature of the point source and extension in obsid 425 ( when  had been bright for weeks ) are significantly different ( see table  [ t : rates ] ) .",
    "these facts argue that scattering halo asymmetries are not the cause of the extension .",
    "we also considered the possibility that the source is unrelated to .",
    "however , the fact that it is both extended and variable on month timescales rules out any extra - galactic object .",
    "the only remaining possibilities are supernova remnants , pulsar wind nebulae , and microquasar jets .",
    "supernova remnants are ruled out by the time variability .",
    "the lack of a radio counterpart and the low number density of pulsar nebulae ( only about 25 are known ; * ? ? ? * ) make this possibility unlikely , p@xmath8 .",
    "finally any microquasar jets would certainly be associated with .",
    "we therefore think it very unlikely that this is a coincidental alignment .",
    "the emission may be flux from the point source scattered by the integrated wolf - rayet wind well outside the binary system .",
    "if the wind is persistent , then the outer regions of the disk wind should be shielded by the denser inner regions . this would result in a morphology dominated by flux close to the system , very different from what we observe .    however , the wolf - rayet wind may still cause the extension via bremsstrahlung at its interface with the ism . @xcite",
    "used _ infrared space observatory _ observations to infer a mass loss rate , which for disk - like wind geometries subtending 1.2sr , could be as high as @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "such a disk wind in the plane of the binary orbit was suggested by @xcite to explain variations in the infrared spectrum and orbital modulation of v(iolet)/r(ed ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite hypothesize that a disk wind inclined to the radio jet axis could obscure one side of the base of a double jet .",
    "this could cause the jet to appear one - sided on milliarcsecond scales and two - sided on larger scales , as is observed . with a terminal velocity of 1500kms@xmath11 @xcite",
    ", such a wind would require about 500@xmath2years to reach the observed 18  extent of the  emission .",
    "this would effectively be a minimum age for the observed extension .",
    "a bremsstrahlung fit to the obsid 425 spectrum gives an electron temperature of @xmath12kev .",
    "the other observations were poorly constrained , but consistent with obsid 425 . with this temperature , and assuming a volume corresponding to a 5  diameter sphere , the data imply an electron density of a few hundred per cubic centimeter . while this is much higher than even the densest disk winds at a radius of 2.5lyr ,",
    "if the wind is plowing into the ism and stopping , then the pertinent quantity is the _ time integrated _ wind density . taking the above disk wind parameters and assuming the wind is fully ionized",
    ", it would require only about 2,000 years to build up the necessary electron density .",
    "time variability would result from ( historical ) changes in the wind intensity that would heat the accumulated material to a greater or lesser degree .",
    "this picture is our most consistent explanation for the observations .",
    "the emission might also be the result of material from an earlier jet ejection colliding with the ism . in this case",
    "the  would most likely be from synchrotron emission , as appears to be the case for the  jets in xte  j1550 - 564 @xcite .",
    "this picture would account for the possible limb brightening of the extension , as the bulk of the emission would be expected at the jet / ism interface .",
    "however , this scenario would require that the jet direction has precessed through a very large angle , since the observed radio jets are aligned close to the north - south direction .",
    "furthermore , the transverse extent of the  structure requires that the jet was either poorly collimated or exhibited significant change in direction during the emission period .",
    "this is significantly different from xte  j1550 - 564 where the jets are collimated to 2@xcite .",
    "we note that the morphology expected from jet emission , a conical feature emanating from the core , should be easily distinguished from the elliptical shape expected from the disk wind model .",
    "we have recently made a _",
    "chandra _  high resolution camera observation to try to distinguish these possibilities .",
    "finally , we note that the microquasars ss433 , ls  i  @xmath661303 , and possibly cyg  x-1 have extended _ radio _ emission around their cores perpendicular to their jet axes @xcite .",
    "while these features are on much smaller ( au ) scales , it is suggested that they are related to disk - like winds in the binary orbital plane .",
    "this suggests that the extended  regions may be visible as radio sources , and deep searches should be carried out .",
