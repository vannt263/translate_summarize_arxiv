    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are thought to originate from an ultra - relativistic outflow that is driven by a sudden catastrophic energy release from a compact stellar central source .",
    "the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is usually attributed to energy dissipation within the relativistic outflow .",
    "the outflow sweeps up the external medium and drives a strong relativistic shock into it , until the outflow is eventually decelerated significantly and most of the energy in the flow is transferred to the shocked external medium ( for recent reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shocked external medium is thought to produce the long lived afterglow emission that is detected in the x - rays , optical , and radio for days , weeks , and months , respectively , after the grb .",
    "afterglow emission was predicted @xcite prior to its detection in 1997 in the x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite , and radio @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its basic observational properties ( light curve and spectrum ) initially agreed rather well with the simple model predictions @xcite .",
    "this gave some credence to the basic picture where the afterglow emission arises from the external shock going into the ambient medium , where the typical emission frequency gradually shifts to longer wavelength as the blast wave decelerates .",
    "as afterglow observations improved , however , new and more complicated behavior was observed , which could not be accommodated by the simplest version of the external shock afterglow model ( which features a spherical adiabatic blast wave propagating into a uniform external medium ) .",
    "this called for new ingredients in the model , i.e. variants of the simplest model .",
    "some of these variants and their observational signatures were predicted before they were observed , which again provided support for the basic model .",
    "the launch of the _ swift _ satellite in november 2004 marked a new era in grb research .",
    "its ability to rapidly and autonomously slew to the direction of grbs that it detects and observe them in the x - rays , uv , and optical has significantly improved our knowledge of the early afterglow , from tens of seconds to hours after the onset of the grb .",
    "the complex behavior that was revealed challenges the traditional afterglow theory , and even puts to question the basic underlying picture .    in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] a short overview is given of the standard afterglow model , starting from the dynamics in the simplest case (   [ sec : spherical ] ) , continuing with the emission mechanism (   [ sec : emission ] ) , and finishing with variants of the simplest model (   [ sec : variants ] ) .",
    "next ,   [ sec : weak ] outlines some of the weaknesses of the standard afterglow model . in   [ sec : swift ] a brief description is given of the major new observations in the _ swift _ era , stressing the difficulties and challenges that they present for the standard afterglow model . finally , ",
    "[ sec : future ] describes the crisis for afterglow theory that was caused by the new observations , and discusses some ideas for resolving the crisis as well as possible directions for the future .",
    "the simplest version of the standard afterglow model features a spherical relativistic adiabatic ( with negligible energy losses or gains ) blast wave that propagates into a uniform external medium , of mass density @xmath1 .",
    "initially , the outflow is decelerated by a reverse shock , while the external medium is swept - up by the forward shock , where the two shocked regions are separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "the ejecta are decelerated by the reverse shock from their original lorentz factor , @xmath2 , to a smaller lorentz factor , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the proper mass densities ( more generally , one should use the ratio of enthalpy densities ) of the original ejecta and the external medium , respectively , then the reverse shock is relativistic . in this case",
    "the relative lorentz factor between the upstream and downstream fluids across the reverse shock , @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 then the reverse shock is newtonian and @xmath11 while @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this basic result may be obtained by equating the ram pressure ( momentum flux ) of the incoming fluids ( ejecta and external medium ) in the rest frame of the shocked fluids , @xmath13 .",
    "if the reverse shock is initially newtonian , then a reasonable spread in the lorentz factor of the outflow ( @xmath14 ) would cause the reverse shock to strengthen more rapidly as it crosses the ejecta shell ( since the shell starts to spread in the radial direction causing a faster drop in its density ) in such a way that it becomes mildly relativistic when the reverse shock finishes crossing the shell .",
    "therefore , in this case as well ( as for an initially relativistic reverse shock ) , most of the energy is transferred to the shocked external medium within a single shell crossing by the reverse shock .    a bright optical emission , referred to as an `` optical flash '' was predicted from the reverse shock on a time scale similar to that of the prompt grb emission @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter it was observed in grb  990123 @xcite and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical expectations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig : optical - flash ] ) .",
    "it was also supported by the detection of a `` radio flare '' @xcite , which was attributed to the emission from the shocked ejecta well after the passage of the reverse shock , as its electrons cool adiabatically at the back of the self - similar hydrodynamic profile and their typical emission frequency passes through the radio after a day or so .",
    "this was considered another success of what has by then become the standard afterglow model .",
    "after the initial stage in which the original outflow is significantly decelerated , most of the energy is given to the shocked external medium and the flow becomes self - similar @xcite .",
    "the deceleration epoch ends and the self - similar stage starts at a radius @xmath15 and an observed time @xmath16 , where @xmath17 $ ] . during the relativistic self - similar stage , the lorentz factor @xmath18 of the shocked external medium scales as a power law with radius @xmath19 .",
    "the scaling is easy to understand if one keeps in mind that in the ( downstream ) rest frame of the shocked fluid the cold upstream fluid comes in with a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath18 , and at the shock front this ordered bulk motion turns into random motion with the same average lorentz factor . in the lab frame",
    "the average energy per particle is larger roughly by a factor of @xmath18 compared to the downstream rest frame of the shocked fluid , and therefore @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total amount of swept - up ( rest ) mass . for a uniform medium @xmath22 and",
    "therefore for an adiabatic blast wave ( for which @xmath23 ) @xmath24 since @xmath25 .",
    "the relativistic self - similar stage ends at @xmath26 when the flow becomes non - relativistic , after which it approaches the newtonian sedov - taylor solution .      the dominant emission mechanism in the afterglow is thought to be synchrotron radiation , of shock - accelerated relativistic electrons that gyrate in the post - shock magnetic fields .",
    "this is supported by the broad band afterglow spectrum , which consists of several power law segments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig:970508spec ] ) , and by the detection of linear polarization at the level of a few percent in the optical or nir afterglows of several grbs @xcite .",
    "synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ; the inverse - compton scattering of the synchrotron photons by the same population of relativistic electrons that emits the synchrotron photons ) can sometimes dominate the afterglow flux in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "the power - law nature of the broad band spectrum suggests a power law energy distribution of shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the electrons and magnetic fields behind the shock are assumed to hold some fixed fractions ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) of the internal energy .",
    "this reproduces the observed spectrum rather well , while together with the simple spherical self - similar dynamics outlined above , it predicts light curves which also consist of several power law segments .",
    "a change in the temporal index occurs either when a spectral break frequency sweeps past the observed frequency ( in which case it is accompanied by a change in the spectral slope near the observed frequency ) , or when a hydrodynamic transition occurs ( in which case no change in the spectral slope is expected across the temporal break ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the various options for the broad band spectrum , as well as the temporal scaling of the flux within each of the different power law segments of the spectrum for a spherical adiabatic blast wave given by the @xcite self - similar solution , for either a uniform external medium , or a wind - like external density profile ( which is discussed in   [ sec : variants ] ) .",
    "several variations on the simplest model have been discussed in the literature , as well as their observational signatures , many of which were proposed before their observational manifestations were detected .",
    "radiative losses have been considered @xcite , and result in a faster decrease of the lorentz factor with radius , since @xmath29 , and also with the observed time .",
    "this , in turn , together with the decrease in time of the energy in the afterglow shock result in a faster decay of the optical and x - ray fluxes .",
    "conversely , energy injection into the afterglow shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would result in a slower flux decay .",
    "a general power law index for the external density , @xmath30 with @xmath31 was considered early on @xcite .",
    "it was only much later , however , when a specific theoretical motivation for such a non - uniform external density profile in the context of grbs was pointed out @xcite , as evidence accumulated in favor of a massive star progenitor that is expected to be surrounded by its pre - supernova stellar wind with @xmath32 . a steeper external density profile ( larger @xmath33 ) results in a faster flux decay in the optical ( and also in x - rays , if below the cooling frequency @xmath34 ) .    it has also been realized that , similar to other astrophysical sources of relativistic outflow such as active galactic nuclei and micro - quasars , the grb outflow is also expected to be collimated into narrow bipolar jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this idea became even more compelling as the measured redshifts of several grbs , which became available thanks to the detection of their afterglows , implied very large energy output in @xmath0-rays assuming isotropic emission , @xmath35 , which approached and in one case ( grb  991023 ) even exceeded a solar rest energy . if most of the @xmath0-rays are emitted within a small fraction , @xmath36 , of the total solid angle ( where @xmath37 for conical uniform narrow bipolar jets of initial half - opening angle @xmath38 ) , then the true energy output in @xmath0-rays , @xmath39 , is much smaller than its isotropic equivalent value , @xmath40 .",
    "simple semi - analytic models for uniform conical jets which expand sideways rapidly when their lorentz factor @xmath18 drops below @xmath41 predicted an achromatic steepening of the afterglow flux decay , i.e. a `` jet break '' in the afterglow light curve @xcite . such jet breaks in the afterglow light curves of many grbs",
    "were indeed detected soon thereafter ( an example is shown in figure  [ fig : jet - break ] ) , which provided good support for grb outflows being collimated into narrow jets .",
    "the structure and dynamics of grb jets , however , are still not fully explored ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "-bands ) of the grb  030329 , which show a clear achromatic break , attributed to a jet , and are fitted to a model featuring two power laws that join smoothly at the jet break time ( from * ? ? ?",
    "the bottom panel shows the fit residuals . ]    in the pre-_swift _ era , while most afterglow light curves showed a smooth power law decay @xcite , and sometimes also a `` jet break '' , some optical afterglows have shown significant temporal variability , with strong deviations from the more typical smooth power law behavior .",
    "the best examples are grbs 021004 @xcite and 030329 @xcite .",
    "possible variants of the simplest standard afterglow model have been suggested in order to account for such temporal variability in grb afterglow light curves .",
    "these include variations in the external density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * see , however , @xcite ) , or in the energy of the afterglow shock .",
    "the latter includes energy injection by `` refreshed shocks ''  slower shells of ejecta that catch up with the afterglow shock on long time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a `` patchy shell ''  angular inhomogeneities within the outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possible cause for variability in the afterglow light curve , although it is expected to be quite rare , is microlensing by an intervening star in a galaxy that happens to be close to our line of sight @xcite .    finally , it is worth mentioning another success of the standard afterglow model : the prediction for the size of the afterglow image which agrees very well with the available observations . for grb  970508 an estimate of the image size of @xmath42 cm after @xmath43days was obtained from the quenching of diffractive scintillations in the radio @xcite . for grb  030329 the size of the afterglow image was measured directly by radio interferometry with the vlba at several different epochs @xcite and agrees well with the expectations of the standard afterglow model @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : image ] .    ) of the radio afterglow of grb  030329 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in model 1",
    "there is relativistic lateral spreading of the grb jet in its local rest frame , while in model 2 there is no significant lateral expansion until the jet becomes non - relativistic .",
    "the external density is taken to be a power law with the distance @xmath44 from the source , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 for a uniform external density while @xmath47 is expected for a stellar wind environment . ]",
    "despite its many successes , the standard afterglow model has several weaknesses , two of which we briefly mention here .",
    "the study of the physics of relativistic collisionless shocks is still at its infancy , and the standard afterglow model simply parameterizes our ignorance .",
    "the usual assumptions are that ( i ) the magnetic field everywhere within the shocked region holds a constant fraction , @xmath28 , of the internal energy , and ( ii ) just behind the shock front all electrons are accelerated into a power law energy distribution ( of index @xmath48 ) with a sharp low energy cutoff and hold a fixed fraction , @xmath27 , of the internal energy .",
    "the validity of these assumptions is not clear , and they are not fully supported by first principles calculations . in principle , even if the electron energy distribution may be reasonably approximated as a power law , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath48 may vary with the shock lorentz factor and the upstream composition .",
    "the same holds for @xmath28 , which may also vary ( decrease ) with the distance behind the shock .",
    "moreover , likely only some fraction @xmath49 of the electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution of energies ( the rest forming a quasi - thermal population ) .",
    "this is an active field of research , with a lot of recent progress involving both analytic work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and particle in cell numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . nevertheless , the major questions are still not fully resolved .",
    "these include the decay of the magnetic field downstream of the shock transition and whether it saturates at some finite value that can explain afterglow observations within the standard picture , how particles are acceleration in these shocks and to what energy distribution .",
    "the dynamics of grb jets as they sweep - up the external medium , decelerate , and eventually expand sideways , have still not been studied in much detail , despite the important implications for grb afterglows and grb physics in general ( for a recent review see * ? ? ? * ) . while simple semi - analytic models suggest that after @xmath18 drops below @xmath41 the jet starts expanding laterally exponentially with radius @xcite , numerical simulations show a much more modest degree of lateral expansion where most of the energy in the flow remains within the original opening angle as long as the jet is relativistic @xcite .",
    "recently , a self - similar solution has been found @xcite in the lines of the simple semi - analytic models .",
    "however , it appears to be approached very slowly , so that for realistic initial conditions it may not be fully applicable and the lateral expansion may indeed be very modest .",
    "_ swift _ has discovered surprising new features in the early x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "these included mainly ( i ) an initial rapid decay phase where @xmath50 with @xmath51 lasting from the end of the prompt emission up to @xmath52s , ( ii ) a subsequent shallow decay phase where @xmath53 , lasting up to @xmath54s ( followed by the familiar pre-_swift _ power law decay with @xmath55 ) , and ( iii ) x - ray flares , which appear to be overlaid on top of the underlying power law decay in stages ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "a good example of such an x - ray light curve that shows these different stages ( but no x - ray flares ) as well as a possible jet break , is grb  050315 , which is shown in figure  [ fig:050315 ] .",
    "the initial rapid decay stage seems to be a smooth extension of the prompt emission @xcite , and is therefore most likely the tail of the prompt grb , probably due to emission from large angles relative to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flares appear to be a distinct emission component , as suggested by their generally different spectrum compared to the underlying power law component , and by the fact that the flux after a flare is usually the continuation of the same underlying power law component from before the flare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in many cases these flares show sharp large amplitude flux variation on time scales @xmath56 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are very hard to produce by the external shock , and suggest a sporadic late time activity of the central source .",
    "an alternative explanation , which does not require a prolonged central source activity , is delayed magnetic reconnection events in the outflow ( giannios 2006 ) .",
    "the shallow decay phase , stage ( ii ) , and the initial rapid decay phase , stage ( i ) , appear to arise from two physically distinct emission regions .",
    "this is supported by a change in the spectral index that is observed in some of the transitions between these two stages @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the shallow decay phase eventually smoothly steepens into the familiar pre-_swift _ flux decay , which is well established to be afterglow emission ( that is attributed to the forward shock in the standard scenario ) , strongly suggesting that the shallow decay phase is similarly afterglow emission .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that there is no evidence for a change in the spectral index across this break @xcite .",
    "there are several suggestions for the cause of the shallow decay phase , including energy injection into the afterglow shock ( of two main types ) , viewing angles slightly outside the region of bright afterglow emission ( see figure  [ fig : viewing - angle ] ) , a complex angular structure of the jet consisting of two or more components ( see figure  [ fig:2comp - jet ] ) , and time varying shock microphysics parameters ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , it is not clear which of these , if any , is indeed the dominant cause .",
    "( _ blue dashed line _ ) where in both cases the viewing angle plays a major role in producing the shallow decay phase ( from * ? ? ?",
    "the initial fast decay is attributed to the tail of the prompt emission and modeled as a power law @xmath57 .",
    "the inset shows afterglow light curves for a ring shaped jet @xcite , for different viewing angles @xmath58 from the jet symmetry axis . ]    ) , the narrow outflow , and the wide outflow . here",
    "@xmath59 is the total kinetic energy of the two components .",
    "the narrow and wide components occupy the non - overlapping ranges in the polar angle @xmath60 ( measured from the symmetry axis ) : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ; @xmath58 is the viewing angle with respect to the jet symmetry axis . ]",
    "the shallow decay phase has interesting implications for grb and afterglow theory .",
    "it implies a very high efficiency ( @xmath63 ) of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission , unless either the energy in the afterglow shock at late times ( @xmath64hr ) has been underestimated , or the shock microphysics parameters significantly vary with time during the early afterglow @xcite .",
    "both are required in order for the @xmath0-ray efficiency to be @xmath65 , which the internal shocks model can reasonably produce .",
    "this in turn requires a large energy in the afterglow shock ( typically @xmath66erg ) .",
    "nevertheless , it can still be accommodated within the framework of the standard afterglow model , albeit , with some modifications .",
    "another interesting finding by _ swift _ is that the early optical emission , which has been attributed in some cases before _ swift _ to the reverse shock , is typically much dimmer than expected @xcite .",
    "this may be since the expectations were too high @xcite and motivated by early pre-_swift _ detections that were exceptionally bright .",
    "alternatively , it could be ( at least partly ) due to a suppression of the reverse shock in strongly magnetized grb outflows @xcite , or since _ swift _ detects dimmer events ( on average ) compared to previous instruments , due to its higher sensitivity .",
    "the latter may also partly explain the relative paucity of detected jet breaks in the _ swift _ era @xcite , although it is not clear yet if this can account for all of the effect .",
    "among the new observational features in the _ swift _ era , the most difficult one to naturally explain within the framework of the standard afterglow model is chromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves .",
    "several grbs show this feature , where the x - rays show a clear break ( steepening of the flux decay rate ) while the optical does not ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig : chromatic ] ) .",
    "the break in the x - ray light curve is usually identified with the end of the shallow decay stage .",
    "the optical light curve follows a single power law decay , usually with a temporal decay index intermediate between those in the x - rays before and after the break .",
    "such chromatic breaks appear to be common among the best monitored _ swift _ afterglows . explaining these chromatic breaks",
    "requires significant changes to the existing afterglow model .",
    "this marks a crisis for standard afterglow theory .",
    "accommodating such chromatic breaks in a model where the x - ray and optical emissions arise from the same physical region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) requires not only time dependent microphysical parameters , but also fine tuning their time ( or shock lorentz factor ) dependence in such a way that will produce a break in the x - ray but not in the optical , which appears somewhat contrived .",
    "the x - ray and optical may arise in separate physical components , which would naturally account for their seemingly decoupled light curves .",
    "however , this type of explanation also introduces a new ingredient ( with its associated degrees of freedom ) into the model , and unless it can be tested against other independent data it is hard to constrain such an option or reach any definitive conclusions .",
    "one might ask : are we just adding epicycles to a fundamentally flawed model ?",
    "this crisis has lead several people to consider more radical solutions .",
    "a good example , is the possibility that the afterglow is dominated by emission from a long - lived reverse shock , as opposed to emission from the forward shock as in the standard afterglow model @xcite .",
    "this has the advantages of avoiding the need to produce near equipartition values of the shock microphysics parameters ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) in the forward shock ( which appears to be difficult , and relies on the poorly understood physics of relativistic collisionless shocks ) and reducing the required efficiency of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission . on the other hand",
    ", it has its own difficulties , such as tending to over - produce the observed optical emission ( when normalized to the observed x - ray flux ) , and a self - absorption frequency that is typically above the radio band ( which is hard to reconcile with radio afterglow detections , although these are admittedly rare in the _ swift _ era ) .",
    "moreover , if taken to the extreme , where the emission is dominated by the reverse shock up to very late times @xcite , then the following problem arises . in a few cases the radio afterglows",
    "are observed out to very late times when the flow becomes sub - relativistic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with no apparent transition from being dominated by one component ( the reverse shock ) to another ( the forward shock ) .",
    "in the newtonian regime , however , the properties of grb remnants should approach those of supernova remnants , which are often directly resolved with the radio emission being dominated by the forward shock .",
    "another rather radical suggestion is that the x - ray emission from the onset of the shallow decay phase and onwards is dominated by `` late prompt '' emission @xcite , due to prolonged activity of the central source , while the optical emission during the same time is dominated by the forward shock emission ( i.e. the traditional afterglow emission ) .",
    "since the x - ray and optical emissions in this model come from distinct physical regions , they are naturally decoupled .",
    "what appears to be less natural , however , is that both the prompt emission and the `` late prompt '' emission arise from similar activity of the central source but have very different temporal ( very variable versus smooth ) and spectral properties .",
    "furthermore , this scenario requires an even higher efficiency of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission , since the x - ray afterglow flux in this model is below the observed x - ray flux , implying a smaller energy in the afterglow shock .",
    "it also requires cold acceleration ( not driven by thermal pressure ) since after the break in the x - rays the flow lorentz factor exceeds the inverse of its half - opening angle .    in summary ,",
    "as the afterglow observations improve , a more complex behavior is revealed , which requires the introduction of new ingredients into the model .",
    "furthermore , some of the basic underlying physics , such as a detailed study of relativistic collisionless shocks and the dynamics of grb jets , are still not fully understood and require further work .",
    "out of the new observations in the _ swift _ era , the most puzzling for afterglow theory are the shallow decay phase and the chromatic breaks .",
    "the former has too many possible explanations , and it is hard to tell which of them if any is indeed the dominant cause , while the latter is still awaiting a natural and convincing explanation without any major problems .",
    "these new observations challenge traditional afterglow theory and call for new ideas .",
    "broad band multi - frequency observations can help constrain the cause of the shallow decay phase ( e.g. distinguish between a highly relativistic and mildly relativistic long lived reverse shock in the energy injection scenario ) and chromatic breaks in grb afterglows .",
    "such observations may also help study the cause of the chromatic breaks . in particular , observations with the large area telescope",
    "( lat ) on board the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast , to be launched in early 2008 ) may give us a better handle on the ssc component which would provide more constraints on the model , and help distinguish between different scenarios ."
