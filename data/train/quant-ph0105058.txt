    "a central problem in quantum information theory is to determine the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel  the maximum rate at which coherent quantum information can be transmitted through the channel and recovered with arbitrarily good fidelity @xcite .",
    "a general solution to the corresponding problem for classical noisy channels was found by shannon in the pioneering paper that launched classical information theory @xcite . with the development of the theory of quantum error correction @xcite",
    ", considerable progress has been made toward characterizing the quantum channel capacity @xcite , but it remains less well understood than the classical capacity .",
    "the asymptotic coherent information has been shown to provide an upper bound on the capacity @xcite and a matching lower bound has been conjectured , but not proven @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the coherent information is not subadditive @xcite , so that its asymptotic value is not easily computed .",
    "therefore , it has been possible to verify the coherent information conjecture in just a few simple cases @xcite .",
    "one quantum channel of considerable intrinsic interest is the gaussian quantum channel , which might also be simple enough to be analytically tractable , thus providing a fertile testing ground for the general theory of quantum capacities .",
    "a simple analytic formula for the capacity of the gaussian classical channel was found by shannon @xcite .",
    "the gaussian quantum channel was studied by holevo and werner @xcite , who computed the one - shot coherent information for gaussian input states , and derived an upper bound on the quantum capacity .",
    "lower bounds on the quantum capacity of the gaussian quantum channel were established by gottesman , kitaev and preskill @xcite .",
    "they developed quantum error - correcting codes that protect a finite - dimensional subspace of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , and showed that these codes can be used to transmit high - fidelity quantum information at a nonzero asymptotic rate . in this paper , we continue the study of the gaussian quantum channel begun in @xcite .",
    "our main result is that the coherent information computed by holevo and werner is in fact an achievable rate .",

    "in contrast , no power constraint is needed to define the quantum capacity of the quantum channel .",

    "holevo and werner derived a general upper bound on the quantum capacity by exploiting the properties of the `` diamond norm '' ( norm of complete boundedness ) of a superoperator .",
    "the diamond norm is defined as follows : first we define the trace norm of an operator @xmath52 as @xmath53 which for a self - adjoint operator is just the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues .",
    "then a norm of a superoperator @xmath19 can be defined as @xmath54 the superoperator norm is not stable with respect to appending an ancillary system on which @xmath19 acts trivially .",

    "holevo and werner showed that for the gaussian quantum channel , the supremum of @xmath1 over gaussian input states is @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ) for @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",

    "the lattice codes developed in @xcite are stabilizer codes @xcite that embed a finite - dimensional code space in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of @xmath48 `` oscillators , '' a system described by @xmath0 canonical variables @xmath76 .",
    "that is , the code space is the simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath0 commuting unitary operators , the generators of the code s stabilizer group .",

    "these vectors can be assembled into the generator matrix @xmath84 of @xmath82 given by @xmath85 then the requirement that the stabilizer generators commute , through eq .",
    "( [ weyl_com ] ) , becomes the condition that the antisymmetric matrix @xmath86 has integral entries , where @xmath87 denotes the transpose of @xmath84 , @xmath88 is the @xmath89 matrix @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the @xmath92 identity matrix . if the generator matrix @xmath84 of a lattice @xmath82 has the property that @xmath93 is an integral matrix , then we will say that the lattice @xmath82 is _ symplectically integral_.    encoded operations that preserve the code subspace are associated with the code s _ normalizer _ group , the group of phase space translations that commute with the code stabilizer .",
    "the generator matrix of the normalizer is a matrix @xmath94 that can be chosen to be @xmath95 so that @xmath96 and @xmath97 we will refer to the lattice generated by @xmath94 as the _ symplectic dual _",
    "@xmath98 of the lattice @xmath82 .",
    "another matrix that generates the same lattice as @xmath84 ( and therefore defines a different set of generators for the same stabilizer group ) is @xmath99 where @xmath37 is an integral matrix with @xmath100 .",
    "this replacement changes the matrix @xmath93 according to @xmath101 by gaussian elimination , an @xmath37 can be constructed such that @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a positive diagonal integral @xmath92 matrix . in the important special case of a _ symplectically self - dual _ lattice ,",
    "both @xmath93 and @xmath105 are integral matrices ; therefore @xmath106 and the standard form of @xmath93 is @xmath107 hence the generator matrix of a symplectically self - dual lattice can be chosen to be a real symplectic matrix : @xmath108 .",
    "if the lattice is rotated , then the generator matrix is transformed as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an orthogonal matrix .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to characterize a lattice with its gram matrix @xmath111 which is symmetric , positive , and rotationally invariant . in the case of a symplectically self - dual lattice , the gram matrix @xmath112 can be chosen to be symplectic , and two symplectic gram matrices @xmath112 and @xmath113 describe the same lattice if @xmath114 where @xmath37 is symplectic and integral .",
    "therefore , the moduli space of symplectically self - dual lattices in @xmath0 dimensions can be represented as @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the space of real symplectic positive @xmath89 matrices of determinant 1 .",
    "the space @xmath117 can also be identified as the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties in complex dimension @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the encoded operations that preserve the code space but act trivially within the code space comprise the quotient group @xmath118 .",
    "the order of this group , the ratio of the volume of the unit cell of @xmath82 to that of @xmath98 , is @xmath119 , where @xmath30 is the dimension of the code space .",

    "the eigenvalues of all stabilizer generators are measured , which determines the value of @xmath130 modulo the normalizer lattice @xmath98 . to recover",
    ", a displacement of minimal length is applied that returns the stabilizer eigenvalues to their standard values , and so restores the quantum state to the code space .",
    "we can associate with the origin of the normalizer lattice its _ voronoi cell _ , the set of points in @xmath131 that are closer to the origin than to any other lattice site .",
    "recovery is successful if the applied displacement lies in this voronoi cell .",
    "thus , we can estimate the likelihood of a decoding error by calculating the probability that the displacement lies outside the voronoi cell .",
    "one way to establish an achievable rate for the gaussian quantum channel is to choose a normalizer lattice @xmath98 whose shortest nonzero vector is sufficiently large . in this section ,",
    "we calculate an achievable rate by demanding that the voronoi cell surrounding the origin contain all typical displacements of the origin in the limit of large @xmath48 . in sec .",
    "v , we will use a more clever argument to improve our estimate of the rate .",
    "the volume of a sphere with unit radius in @xmath26 dimensions is @xmath132 and from the stirling approximation we find that @xmath133 it was shown by minkowski @xcite that lattice sphere packings exist in @xmath26 dimensions that fill a fraction at least @xmath134 of space . correspondingly , if the lattice is chosen to be unimodular , so that its unit cell has unit volume , then kissing spheres centered at the lattice sites can be chosen to have a radius @xmath135 such that @xmath136 or @xmath137 this lower bound on the efficiency of sphere packings has never been improved in the nearly 100 years since minkowski s result .",
    "more recently , buser and sarnak @xcite have shown that this same lower bound applies to lattices that are symplectically self - dual .",
    "now consider the case of @xmath138-dimensional phase space .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath26 , the channel will apply a phase space translation by a distance which with high probability will be less than @xmath139 , for any positive @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , a code that can correct a shift this large will correct all likely errors . what rate can such a code attain ?",
    "if the code is a lattice stabilizer code , and the dimension of the code space is @xmath30 , then the unit cell of the code s normalizer lattice has volume @xmath141 nonoverlapping spheres centered at the sites of the normalizer lattice can be chosen to have radius @xmath142 , where @xmath143 or @xmath144 the error probability becomes arbitrarily small for large @xmath48 if eq .",
    "( [ dimen_epsilon ] ) is satisfied , for any positive @xmath140 .",
    "we conclude that the rate @xmath145 is achievable , provided @xmath146 . however , as noted in sec .",
    "iii , the rates that can be attained by this construction ( rescaling of a symplectically self - dual lattice ) are always of the form @xmath147 , where @xmath126 is an integer .",
    "the achievable rate found in eq .",
    "( [ nonoverlap_rate ] ) falls two qubits short of the coherent information eq .",
    "( [ hw_coherent ] ) .",
    "we will now show that this gap can be closed by using tighter estimates of the error probability .",
    "we established eq .",
    "( [ nonoverlap_rate ] ) by filling phase space with nonoverlapping spheres , which is overly conservative .",
    "it is acceptable for the spheres to overlap , as long as the overlaps occupy an asymptotically negligible fraction of the total volume , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : square_circle ] .",
    "our improved estimate applies another result obtained by buser and sarnak @xcite .",
    "they note that the moduli space of symplectically self - dual lattices is compact and equipped with a natural invariant measure .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider averaging over all lattices .",
    "denote by @xmath148 the average over all symplectically self - dual lattices with specified dimension @xmath138 , and let @xmath149 denote an integrable rotationally - invariant function of the vector @xmath3 ( that is a function of the length @xmath150 of @xmath3 ) .",
    "then buser and sarnak @xcite show that @xmath151 ( note that the sum is over all _ nonzero _ vectors in the lattice @xmath82 . )",
    "it follows that there must exist a _",
    "particular _ symplectically self - dual lattice @xmath82 such that @xmath152 the statement that a _ unimodular",
    "_ lattice exists that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mink_hla ] ) is the well - known minkowski - hlawka theorem @xcite .",
    "buser and sarnak established the stronger result that the lattice can be chosen to be symplectically self - dual .",
    "we can use this result to bound the probability of a decoding error , and establish that a specified rate is achievable .",
    "our argument will closely follow de buda @xcite , who performed a similar analysis of lattice codes for the gaussian classical channel . however , the quantum case is considerably easier to analyze , because we can avoid complications arising from the power constraint @xcite .",
    "a decoding error occurs if the channel displaces the origin to a point outside the voronoi cell centered at the origin .",
    "the voronoi cell has a complicated geometry , so that the error probability is not easy to analyze .",
    "but we can simplify the analysis with a trick @xcite .",
    "imagine drawing a sphere with radius @xmath153 around each lattice site , where @xmath154 ; this value of @xmath15 is chosen so that the typical displacement introduced by the channel has length less than @xmath15 ; the probability of a shift larger than @xmath15 thus becomes negligible for large @xmath26 .",
    "it may be that these spheres overlap .",
    "however , a vector that is contained in the sphere centered at the origin , and is not contained in the sphere centered at any other lattice site , must be closer to the origin than any other lattice site .",
    "therefore , the vector is contained in the origin s voronoi cell , and is a shift that can be corrected successfully .",
    "( see fig .  1 .",
    ")    hence ( ignoring the possibility of an atypical shift by @xmath155 ) we can upper bound the probability of error by estimating the probability that the shift moves any other lattice site into the sphere of radius @xmath15 around the origin .",
    "we then find @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the probability of a displacement by @xmath5 .",
    "the buser - sarnak theorem @xcite tells us that there exists a lattice whose unit cell has volume @xmath158 , and which is related by rescaling to a symplectically self - dual lattice , such that @xmath159 by interchanging the order of integration , we find that @xmath160 the ratio of the volume of the @xmath26-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath15 to the volume of the unit cell .",
    "now the volume @xmath158 of the unit cell of the normalizer lattice @xmath98 , and the dimension @xmath30 of the code space , are related by @xmath161 where @xmath37 is the rate , and we may estimate the volume of the sphere as @xmath162 where @xmath138 . thus we conclude that @xmath163 therefore , the error probability becomes small for large @xmath48 for any rate @xmath37 such that @xmath164 where @xmath140 may be arbitrarily small .",
    "we conclude that the rate @xmath165 is achievable in the limit @xmath166 , provided that @xmath167 .",
    "this rate matches the optimal value eq .",
    "( [ hw_coherent ] ) of the one - shot coherent information for gaussian inputs .",
    "we note , again , that the rates that we can obtain from rescaling a symplectically self - dual lattice are restricted to @xmath168 , where @xmath126 is an integer .",
    "thus for specified @xmath7 , the achievable rate that we have established is really the maximal value of @xmath169 such that the positive integer @xmath126 satisfies @xmath170",
    "another method for establishing achievable rates over the gaussian quantum channel was described in @xcite , based on _",
    "concatenated coding_. in each of @xmath48 `` oscillators '' described by canonical variables @xmath171 and @xmath172 , a @xmath173-dimensional system ( `` qudit '' ) is encoded that is protected against sufficiently small shifts in @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the encoded qudit is associated with a square lattice in 2-dimensional phase space .",
    "then a stabilizer code is constructed that embeds a @xmath174-qudit code space in the hilbert space of @xmath48 qudits ; these @xmath174 encoded qudits are protected if a sufficiently small fraction of the @xmath48 qudits are damaged .",
    "let us compare the rates achieved by concatenated codes to the rates achieved with codes derived from efficient sphere packings .",
    "we analyze the effectiveness of concatenated codes in two stages .",
    "first we consider how likely each of the @xmath48 qudits is to sustain damage if the underlying oscillator is subjected to the gaussian quantum channel .",
    "the area of the unit cell of the two - dimensional square normalizer lattice that represents the encoded operations acting on the qudit is @xmath175 , and the minimum distance between lattice sites is @xmath176 .",
    "a displacement of @xmath9 by @xmath177 , where @xmath15 is an integer , is the operation @xmath178 acting on the code space , and a displacement of @xmath10 by @xmath179 is the operation @xmath180 , where @xmath52 and @xmath181 are the pauli operators acting on the qudit ; these act on a basis @xmath182 for the qudit according to @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "shifts in @xmath10 or @xmath9 can be corrected successfully provided that they satisfy @xmath185 if the shifts in @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gaussian random variables with variance @xmath7 , then the probability that a shift causes an uncorrectable error is no larger than the probability that the shift exceeds @xmath186 , or @xmath187 where @xmath188 denotes the complementary error function .",
    "here @xmath189 is the probability of an `` @xmath52 error '' acting on the qudit , of the form @xmath178 for @xmath190 , and @xmath191 denotes the probability of a `` @xmath181 error '' of the form @xmath180 for @xmath192 .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath181 errors are uncorrelated , and errors with @xmath193 are much more likely than errors with @xmath194 . by choosing @xmath195 , we can achieve a small error probability for each oscillator .",
    "the second stage of the argument is to determine the rate that can be achieved by a qudit code if @xmath196 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ prob_bound ] ) .",
    "we will consider codes of the calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) type , for which the correction of @xmath52 errors and @xmath181 errors can be considered separately @xcite .",
    "a css code is a stabilizer code , in which each stabilizer generator is either a tensor product of @xmath197 s and powers of @xmath181 ( measuring these generators diagnoses the @xmath52 errors ) or a tensor product of @xmath197 s and powers of @xmath52 ( for diagnosing the @xmath181 errors ) .",
    "we can establish an achievable rate by averaging the error probability over css codes ; we give only an informal sketch of the argument .",
    "suppose that we fix the block size @xmath48 and the number of encoded qudits @xmath174 .",
    "now select the generators of the code s stabilizer group at random .",
    "about half of the @xmath198 generators are of the @xmath181 type and about half are of the @xmath52 type .",
    "thus the number of possible values for the eigenvalues of the generators of each type is about @xmath199 now we can analyze the probability that an uncorrectable @xmath52 error afflicts the encoded quantum state ( the probability of an uncorrectable @xmath181 error is analyzed in exactly the same way ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath52 errors act independently on the @xmath48 qudits in the block , with a probability of error per qudit of @xmath189 .",
    "thus for large @xmath48 , the typical number of damaged qudits is close to @xmath200 .",
    "a damaged qudit can be damaged in any of @xmath201 different ways ( @xmath178 , where @xmath202 ) .",
    "we will suppose , pessimistically , that all @xmath201 shifts of the qudit are equally likely .",
    "the actual situation that arises in our concatenated coding scheme is more favorable  small values of @xmath203 are more likely  but our argument will not exploit this feature .    thus , with high probability , the error that afflicts the block will belong to a typical set of errors that contains a number of elements close to @xmath204 where @xmath205 if a particular typical error occurs , then recovery will succeed as long as there is no other typical error that generates the same error syndrome .",
    "it will be highly unlikely that another typical error has the same syndrome as the actual error , provided that the number of possible error syndromes @xmath206 is large compared to the number of typical errors .",
    "therefore , the @xmath52 errors can be corrected with high probability for @xmath207 or for a rate @xmath208 in qudits satisfying @xmath209 similarly , the @xmath181 errors can be corrected with high probability by a random css code if the rate satisfies @xmath210 converted to qubits , the rate becomes @xmath211 under these conditions , the probability of error averaged over css codes becomes arbitrarily small for @xmath48 large .",

    "both the concatenated codes and the codes derived from efficient sphere packings are stabilizer codes , and therefore both are associated with lattices in @xmath0-dimensional phase space .",
    "but while the sphere - packing codes have been chosen so that the shortest nonzero vector on the lattice is large relative to the size of the unit cell , the concatenated codes correspond to sphere packings of poor quality . for the concatenated codes ,",
    "the shortest vector of the normalizer lattice has length @xmath219 , where @xmath220 and the rate @xmath37 is close to @xmath216 .",
    "the efficient sphere packings have radius @xmath221 close to @xmath222 , or @xmath223 hence , if we compare sphere - packing codes and concatenated codes with comparable rates , the sphere - packing codes have minimum distance that is larger by a factor of about @xmath224 .",
    "the concatenated codes achieve a high rate not because the minimum distance of the lattice is large , but rather because the decoding procedure exploits the hierarchical structure of the code .",
    "we have found that quantum stabilizer codes based on efficient sphere packings can achieve rates for the gaussian quantum channel that match the one - shot coherent information , and that concatenated codes achieve rates that are below , but close to , the coherent information .",
    "now , as an aside , we will discuss the corresponding statements for the classical gaussian channel .",
    "we will see , in particular , that concatenated codes achieve rates that are close to the classical channel capacity .",
    "shannon s expression for the capacity of the classical gaussian channel can be understood heuristically as follows @xcite .",
    "if the input signals have average power @xmath38 , which is inflated by the gaussian noise to @xmath225 , then if @xmath26 real variables are transmitted , the total volume occupied by the space of output signals is the volume of a sphere of radius @xmath226 , or @xmath227 we will decode a received message as the signal state that is the minimal distance away . consider averaging over all codes that satisfy the power constraint and have @xmath30 signals .",
    "when a message is received , the signal that was sent will typically occupy a decoding sphere of radius @xmath228 centered at the received message , which has volume @xmath229 a decoding error can arise if another one of the @xmath30 signals , aside from the one that was sent , is also contained in the decoding sphere .",
    "the probability that a randomly selected signal inside the sphere of radius @xmath226 is contained in a particular decoding sphere of radius @xmath139 is the ratio of the volume of the spheres , so the probability of a decoding error can be upper bounded by @xmath30 times that ratio , or @xmath230 where @xmath37 is the rate of the code .",
    "if the probability of error averaged over codes and signals satisfies this bound , there is a particular code that satisfies the bound when we average only over signals .",
    "if @xmath231 when we average over signals , then we can discard at most half of all the signals ( reducing the rate by at most @xmath232 bits ) to obtain a new code with @xmath233 for _ all _ signals . since",
    "@xmath140 can be chosen arbitrarily small for sufficiently large @xmath26 , we conclude that there exist codes with arbitrarily small probability of error and rate @xmath37 arbitrarily close to @xmath234 which is the shannon capacity .",
    "conversely , for any rate exceeding @xmath235 , the decoding spheres inevitably have nonnegligible overlaps , and the error rate can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "suppose that , instead of shannon s random coding , we use a lattice code based on an efficient packing of spheres . in this case , the power constraint can be imposed by including as signals all lattice sites that are contained in an @xmath26-dimensional ball of radius @xmath236 , and the typical shifts by distance @xmath222 must be correctable .",
    "thus decoding spheres of radius @xmath222 are to be packed into a sphere of total radius @xmath226 .",
    "suppose that the lattice is chosen so that nonoverlapping spheres centered at the lattice sites fill a fraction at least @xmath237 of the total volume ; the existence of such a lattice is established by minkowski s estimate @xcite .",
    "then the number @xmath30 of signals satisfies @xmath238 or @xmath239 corresponding to the rate @xmath240 which is one bit less than the shannon capacity .",
    "much as in the discussion of quantum lattice codes in sec .",
    "[ sec : improve ] , an improved estimate of the achievable rate is obtained if we allow the decoding spheres to overlap @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are classical lattice codes with rate arbitrarily close to the capacity , such that the probability of error , _ averaged _ over signals , is arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , though , because of the power constraint , the error probability depends on which signal is sent , and the trick of deleting the worst half of the signals would destroy the structure of the lattice .",
    "alternatively , it can be shown that for any rate @xmath241 there are lattice codes with maximal probability of error that is arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "this achievable rate approaches the capacity for large @xmath242 .",
    "now consider the rates that can be achieved for the gaussian classical channel with concatenated coding . a @xmath173-state system ( dit )",
    "is encoded in each of @xmath26 real variables .",
    "if each real variable takes one of @xmath173 possible values , with spacing @xmath243 between the signals , then a shift by @xmath244 can be corrected . by replacing the sum over @xmath173 values by an integral , which can be justified for large @xmath173",
    ", we find an average power per signal @xmath245 thus the largest correctable shift can be expressed in terms of the average power as @xmath246 for the gaussian channel with mean zero and variance @xmath7 , the probability @xmath10 of an error in each real variable transmitted is no larger than the probability of a shift by a distance exceeding @xmath244 , or @xmath247 where @xmath188 denotes the complementary error function .",
    "we reduce the error probability further by encoding @xmath248 dits in the block of @xmath26 dits . arguing as in sec .",
    "[ sec : concat ] , we see that a random code for dits achieves an asymptotic rate in bits given by @xmath249 given @xmath7 , using the expression eq .",
    "( [ classical_prob_bound ] ) for @xmath10 , and choosing @xmath173 to optimize the rate in eq .",
    "( [ shannon_qudit_rate ] ) , we obtain a rate close to the shannon capacity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : classical ] . as for the concatenated quantum code ,",
    "the rate of the concatenated classical code is close to @xmath216 , where @xmath250 , and @xmath251 is a slowly varying function .",
    "we have described quantum stabilizer codes , based on symplectically integral lattices in phase space , that protect quantum information carried by systems described by continuous quantum variables . with these codes",
    ", we can establish lower bounds on the capacities of continuous - variable quantum channels .    for the gaussian quantum channel",
    ", the best rate we know how to achieve with stabilizer coding matches the one - shot coherent information optimized over gaussian inputs , at least when the value of the coherent information is @xmath252 of an integer . that our achievable rate matches the coherent information only for isolated values of the noise variance @xmath7 seems to be an artifact of our method of analysis , rather than indicative of any intrinsic property of the channel . hence it is tempting to speculate that this optimal one - shot coherent information actually is the quantum capacity of the channel .",
    "conceivably , better rates can be achieved with _ nonadditive _ quantum codes that can not be described in terms of symplectically integral lattices .",
    "we do nt know much about how to construct these codes , or about their properties .",
    "in the case of the depolarizing channel acting on qubits , shor and smolin discovered that rates exceeding the one - shot coherent information could be achieved .",
    "their construction used concatenated codes , where the `` outer code '' is a random stabilizer code , and the `` inner code '' is a degenerate code with a small block size @xcite . the analogous procedure for the gaussian channel would be to concatenate an outer code based on a symplectically integral lattice with an inner code that encodes one logical oscillator in a block of several oscillators .",
    "this inner code , then , embeds an infinite - dimensional code space in a larger infinite - dimensional space , as do codes constructed by braunstein @xcite and lloyd and slotine @xcite .",
    "however , we have not been able to find concatenated codes of this type that achieve rates exceeding the one - shot coherent information of the gaussian channel .",
