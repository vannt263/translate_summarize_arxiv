    "we include the following improvements over previous determinations : the consideration of the temperature inhomogeneities that affects the helium and heavy elements abundance determinations , the derivation of the o and c abundances from recombination line intensities , the consideration of the collisional excitation of the triplet lines from the @xmath0s level by determining the helium abundance from many line intensity ratios , and the study of the @xmath0s level optical depth effects on the intensity of the triplet lines by observing a large number of singlet and triplet lines of .",
    "we are interested in three applications based on the abundance determinations : the determination of @xmath1 , the comparison of the nebular abundances derived in this paper with the stellar abundances of supergiant stars in ngc 6822 derived elsewhere @xcite , and to provide accurate abundances for galactic chemical evolution models of this object ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 6822 is an irregular galaxy member of the local group particularly suited for chemical evolution models because its star formation history is well known @xcite , and apparently has not been affected by tidal effects , therefore its chemical composition might permit to decide if outflows to the intergalactic medium have occurred in this galaxy .",
    "the importance of outflows to the intergalactic medium from nearby irregular galaxies depends on many factors , like their total mass , the distribution in time and space of their star formation , and tidal effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the aperture extractions were made for an area of 22.4 `` @xmath6 0.51 '' for region v and an area of 24.6 `` @xmath6 0.51 '' for region x , covering the brightest parts of both regions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the resolution for the emission lines observed with the blue grism is given by @xmath7 , with the red grism is given by @xmath8 , and with the low resolution grism is given by @xmath9 .",

    "the errors were estimated by comparing all the measured h line intensities , with those predicted by the computations of @xcite and by assuming that the signal to noise increases as the square root of the measured flux .",
    "these estimates are in agreement with the differences found when comparing the line fluxes observed in different exposures .",
    "the temperatures and densities presented in table  [ tdat ] were derived from the line intensities presented in table  [ tlines ] .",
    "the determinations were carried out based on the temden iraf subroutine ; this subroutine models a 5- , 6- , or 8-level ion to derive these quantities .    to compute @xmath3 ( [ ] ) , the contribution to the intensities of the @xmath19 7319 , 7320 , 7331 , and 7332 [ ] lines due to recombination was taken into account based on the following equation : @xmath20 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* equations 8 - 12 ) @xmath29    using the o recombination lines of region v , based on these equations , we obtain @xmath30  k and @xmath31 . since in this object most of the oxygen is twice ionized ( see section 5.3 ) , this @xmath1 value is representative for the whole region .",
    "it is also possible to derive the @xmath1 value from the analysis of the helium lines ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "the resulting values are : @xmath32 and @xmath33 for regions v and x respectively . for region v we combine the oxygen and the helium determinations and adopt @xmath34 ; for region x we simply adopt the @xmath1 helium determination .",
    "the @xmath1 values derived for regions v and x are somewhat larger than those derived for galactic regions , that typically are in the 0.03 to 0.04 range @xcite but are similar to those derived in giant extragalactic regions @xcite .",
    "to obtain he@xmath35/h@xmath35 values we need a set of effective recombination coefficients for the he and h lines , the contribution due to collisional excitation to the helium line intensities , and an estimate of the optical depth effects for the helium lines .",
    "the recombination coefficients used were those by @xcite for h , and those by @xcite and @xcite for he .",
    "the collisional contribution was estimated from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the optical depth effects in the triplet lines were estimated from the computations by @xcite .    before using the helium lines , much in the same way",
    "as we do for hydrogen lines , we need to correct them for underlying absorption and , in the cases of @xmath16  3889 and @xmath16  4713 , for blends . to correct the blue lines , @xmath36   , for underlying absorption we used the values determined by @xcite , for the redder lines we used values determined by cervio m. ( private communication ) based on the paper by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the underlying absorption in the helium lines scales , in the same way as it does in the hydrogen lines , as a fraction of the correction to h@xmath11 . after discarding the lines that could not be easily unblended or those for which there is no accurate atomic data ,",
    "the remaining lines are presented in table  [ tmlm ] .",
    "we have many measured helium lines , each of them with a different dependence on temperature and density . in principle",
    "one can find line ratios that will allow to measure temperature or density . in practice",
    "the dependence of each ratio is weak , also each ratio depends simultaneously on @xmath22 , @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath37 ; making the determinations , obtained from any one ratio , to have large error bars . in order to optimize our data we used a maximum likelihood method ( mlm ) to search for the physical and chemical conditions ( @xmath22 , @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and he@xmath35/h@xmath35 ) that would give us the best simultaneous fit to all the measured lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for these objects the mlm can not determine the electron density with high enough accuracy to be useful ; therefore we have adopted the electron densities derived from collisionally excited lines . based on table  [ tdat ]",

    "in order for this temperature to be representative of the whole region we used a weighted average of @xmath3 ( [ ] ) and @xmath3 ( [ ] ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : for region v we used @xmath3([+])@xmath40  k and for region x we used@xmath3([+])@xmath41  k.    from these line intensities , densities , temperatures and the mlm we obtained the he abundances presented in table  [ trionic ] , a @xmath42 for region v , and a @xmath43 for region x.      the c@xmath44 abundance was derived from the @xmath45   line of and the effective recombination coefficients computed by @xcite for case a and @xmath46  k. we only observe the @xmath45   line in region  v , the expected flux of this line for region  x would produce a s / n@xmath471 , making it impossible to measure .    the o@xmath44 abundance was derived from multiplet 1 of @xcite .",
    "the multiplet consists of 8 lines and the sum of their intensities , @xmath12(sum ) , normalized to @xmath12(h@xmath11 ) , is independent of the electron density .",
    "on the other hand the normalized intensity of each of the eight lines does depend on the electron density @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that , for typical region densities , the relative intensities of the lines of the multiplet deviate from the lte computation predictions . in order to determine what fraction of the intensity of the whole multiplet",

    "it can be seen that the intensity of the lines that originate in the 3p  @xmath49d@xmath50 and 3p @xmath49d@xmath51 energy levels decreases with increasing local density , while the intensity of those lines that originate in the 3p  @xmath49d@xmath52 increases with increasing density .",
    "this is due to the effect of collisional redistribution that increases the population of the high statistical weight levels at the expense of the low statistical weight ones .",

    "we have also computed the hydrogen , helium , and heavy elements by mass for ngc 6822 v and amount to : @xmath88 = 0.7501 , @xmath89 = 0.2433 , and @xmath90 = 0.0066 .",
    "the @xmath90 value was computed from the c , n , o , ne , and fe abundances ( see table  [ tta ] , where the fe abundance comes from stellar data by * ? ? ? * ) and assuming that they constitute 83.3@xmath91 of the total @xmath90 value .",

    "x the he@xmath35/h@xmath35 differences are not significative because the observational errors are larger than the differences predicted by the non - linearity .",
    "the smaller errors for region  v than for region  x are due to the higher luminosity of region  v , as can be seen in table  [ tlines ] . due to the smaller errors in the line intensities of region",

    "we find excellent agreement between the stellar o / h values and the ones found using recombination lines ; alternatively , the agreement with the values derived using collisionally excited lines ( @xmath68 ) is poor .",
    "also , based on three b supergiant stars in ngc 6822 @xcite find a fe / h of -0.5 @xmath93 0.2 dex relative to the sun in excellent agreement with the results of @xcite for two a type supergiants .",
    "also in table  [ tta ] we present the orion and the solar abundances for comparison . for orion : fe comes from @xcite based on orion b stars , and all the other elements from @xcite . for the sun : he comes from @xcite , and all the other elements from @xcite , the solar abundances are the photospheric ones with the exception of he that corresponds to the initial he abundance and of cl that comes from meteoritic data .",
    "we consider that the orion nebula is more representative of the present chemical composition of the solar vicinity than the sun for two main reasons : a ) the sun appears deficient by roughly 0.1 dex in o , si , ca , sc , ti , y , ce , nd and eu , compared with its immediate neighbors with similar iron abundances @xcite , the probable reason for this difference is that the sun is somewhat older than the comparison stars ; and b ) all the chemical evolution models of the galaxy predict a steady increase of the o / h ratio in the solar vicinity with time , for example the chemical evolution models of the solar vicinity presented by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the o / h value in the solar vicinity has increased by 0.13  dex since the sun was formed .",
    "there are two independent methods to determine the o / h ratio in the ism of the solar vicinity : a ) from the solar 12 + log o / h ratio by @xcite that amounts to 8.66 and taking into account the increase of the o / h ratio due to galactic chemical evolution since the sun was formed , that according to state of the art chemical evolution models of the galaxy amounts to 0.13 dex ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain a value of 8.79 dex ; b ) the o / h value derived by @xcite , based on the galactic gradient determined from the recombination lines observed in regions , that amounts to 8.79 dex in perfect agreement with the value based on the solar abundance and the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite have derived a value of 12 + log o / h = 8.45 for the a supergiant wlm 15 in the local group dwarf irregular galaxy wlm , they have also derived a value of 12 + log o / h = 7.83 for two regions in the same galaxy based on the @xmath3(4363/5007 ) temperature and under the assumption that @xmath68 .",
    "the discrepancy between these two determinations can be reduced by assuming that 20% of the oxygen atoms are trapped in dust grains inside regions , as is the case in the orion nebula @xcite , and by considering the presence of spatial temperature fluctuations .",
    "a typical correction for spatial temperature fluctuations based on the recombination lines of in ngc  6822v and other extragalactic regions @xcite amounts to about 0.25 dex .",
    "we show that the ratios of the lines of multiplet 1 of are not constant , but instead they depend on density . only at high densities",
    "they coincide with the ratios predicted using lte .",
    "the same arguments can probably be made for most recombination lines from other multiplets of heavy elements .",
    "we present a set of empirical equations to determine the o abundances from recombination lines of multiplet 1 of .",
    "these equations are useful for those cases in which not all the lines of the multiplet are observed .",
    "we derive for the first time the c / h and o / h abundances of ngc 6822 based on recombination lines .",
    "we have also derived the n , o , ne , s , cl , and ar abundances based on collisionally excited lines for @xmath92 and for @xmath75 ( the @xmath1 derived in this paper ) .",
    "the o / h ratio derived from recombination lines is 0.26 dex higher than that derived from [ ] @xmath94 collisionally excited lines under the assumption that @xmath68 ( that is , by adopting the @xmath3(4363/5007 ) temperature ) .",
    "we have found that , in ngc  6822 , the o / h abundance ratio derived from recombination lines is in very good agreement with the o / h ratios derived from a - type supergiants , while the o / h abundances derived from collisionally excited lines are not .",
    "this result is qualitatively equivalent to that found for the solar vicinity by @xcite and @xcite ; these authors find that the region o / h recombination abundances are in agreement with the o / h solar abundances after considering the o / h enrichment predicted by a chemical evolution model of the galaxy , while the region o / h abundances derived from collisionally excited lines ( assuming @xmath68 ) are not .",
    "the high n / o ratio places ngc  6822 on the plateau formed by irregular galaxies in the n / o - o / h diagram , which implies that a large fraction of the n present in this object is already due to secondary production . from the o / h , c / o , and n / o values it follows that ngc 6822 is considerably more chemically evolved than the smc .",
