    "primates excel at view - invariant object recognition  @xcite .",
    "this is a computationally demanding task , as an individual object can lead to an infinite number of very different projections onto the retinal photoreceptors while it varies under different 2-d and 3-d transformations .",
    "it is believed that the primate visual system solves the task through hierarchical processing along the ventral stream of the visual cortex  @xcite .",
    "this stream ends in the inferotemporal cortex ( it ) , where object representations are robust , invariant , and linearly - separable  @xcite .",
    "although there are extensive within- and between - area feedback connections in the visual system , neurophysiological  @xcite , behavioral  @xcite , and computational  @xcite studies suggest that the first feed - forward flow of information ( @xmath0 ms post - stimulus presentation ) might be sufficient for object recognition  @xcite and even invariant object recognition  @xcite .    motivated by this feed - forward information flow and the hierarchical organization of the visual cortical areas ,",
    "many computational models have been developed over the last decades to mimic the performance of the primate ventral visual pathway in object recognition .",
    "early models were only comprised of a few layers  @xcite , while the new generation , called  deep convolutional neural networks \" ( dcnns ) contain many layers ( 8 and above ) .",
    "dcnns are large neural networks with millions of free parameters that are optimized through an extensive training phase using millions of labeled images  @xcite .",
    "they have shown impressive performances in difficult object and scene categorization tasks with hundreds of categories  @xcite .",
    "yet the view - point variations were not carefully controlled in these studies .",
    "this is an important limitation : in the past , it has been shown that models performing well on apparently challenging image databases may fail to reach human - level performance when objects are varied in size , position , and most importantly 3-d transformations  @xcite .",
    "dcnns are position invariant by construction , thanks to weight sharing . however ,",
    "for other transformations such as scale , rotation in depth , rotation in plane , and 3-d transformations , there is no built - in invariance mechanism . instead , these invariances are acquired through learning .",
    "although the features extracted by dcnns are significantly more powerful than their hand - designed counterparts like sift and hog  @xcite , they may have difficulties to tackle 3-d transformations .    to date , only a handful of studies",
    "have assessed the performance of dcnns and their constituent layers in invariant object recognition @xcite . in this study",
    "we systematically compared humans and dcnns at view - invariant object recognition , using exactly the same images .",
    "the advantages of our work with respect to previous studies are : ( 1 ) we used a larger object database , divided into five categories ; ( 2 ) most importantly , we controlled and varied the magnitude of the variations in size , position , in - depth and in - plane rotations ; ( 3 ) we benchmarked eight state - of - the - art dcnns , the hmax model  @xcite ( an early biologically inspired shallow model ) , and a very simple shallow model that classifies directly from the pixel values ( `` pixel '' ) ; ( 4 ) in our psychophysical experiments , the images were presented briefly and with backward masking , presumably blocking feedback ; ( 5 ) we performed extensive comparisons between different layers of dcnns and studied how invariance evolves through the layers ; ( 6 ) we compared models and humans in terms of performance , error distributions , and representational geometry ; and ( 7 ) to measure the influence of the background on the invariant object recognition problem our dataset included both segmented and unsegmented images .",
    "this approach led to new findings : ( 1 ) deeper was usually better and more human - like , but only in the presence of large variations ; ( 2 ) some dcnns reached human performance even with large variations ; ( 3 ) some dcnns had error distributions which were indiscernible from those of humans ; ( 4 ) some dcnns used representations that were more consistent with human responses , and these were not necessarily the top performers .",
    "the idea behind dcnns is a combination of deep learning  @xcite with convolutional neural networks  @xcite .",
    "dcnns have a hierarchy of several consecutive feature detector layers .",
    "lower layers are mainly selective to simple features while higher layers tend to detect more complex features .",
    "convolution is the main process in each layer that is generally followed by complementary operations such as max pooling and output normalization . up to now , various learning algorithms have been proposed for dcnns , and among them the supervised learning methods have achieved stunning successes@xcite .",
    "recent advances have led to the birth of supervised dcnns with remarkable performances on extensively large and difficult object databases such as imagenet  @xcite .",
    "we have selected the eight most recent , powerful , and supervised dcnns and tested them in one of the most challenging visual recognition task , i.e. invariant object recognition .",

    "al .  @xcite .",
    "briefly , we built object images with different variation levels , where objects varied across five dimensions , namely : size , position ( x and y ) , rotation in - depth , rotation in - plane , and background . to generate object images under different variations , we used 3-d computer models ( 3-d object images )",
    "variations were divided into seven levels from no object variations ( level 1 ) to mid- and high - level variations ( level 7 ) . in each level , random values were sampled from uniform distributions for every dimension . after sampling these random values , we applied them to the 3-d object model and generated a 2-d object image by snapshotting from the varied 3-d model .",
    "we performed the same procedure for all levels and objects .",
    "note that the magnitude of variations in every dimension was randomly selected from uniform distributions that were restricted to predefined levels ( i.e. from level 1 to 7 ) .",
    "for example , in level three a random value between @xmath6 - @xmath7 was selected for in - depth rotation , a random value between @xmath6 - @xmath7 was selected for in - plane rotation , and so on ( see fig .",

    "the size of 2-d images were @xmath8 pixels .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for different dimensions , a higher variation level has broader variation intervals than the lower levels .",
    "there were on average 16 3-d image exemplars per category .",
    "all 2-d object images were then superimposed onto randomly selected natural images for experiment with natural backgrounds .",
    "there were over 3,900 natural images collected from the web , consisting of a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes .          in total , 26 human subjects participated in a rapid invariant object categorization task ( 17 males and 9 females , age 21 - 32 , mean age of 26 years ) .",
    "each trial started with a black fixation cross presented for 500 ms .",
    "then an image was randomly selected from a pool of images and was presented at the center of screen for 25 ms ( two frames , on a 80 hz monitor ) .",
    "the image was followed by a uniform blank screen presented for 25 ms , as an inter - stimulus interval ( isi ) . immediately afterwards , a 1/f noise mask was presented for 100 ms to account for feed - forward processing and minimize the effects of back projections from higher visual areas .",
    "this type of masking is well established to be used in rapid object recognition tasks  @xcite .",

    "so processing of a new stimulus ( the noise mask ) will interrupt the processing of the previous stimulus ( the object image ) before it can be modulated by the feedback signals from higher areas  @xcite . in our experiment",
    ", there is a 50 ms stimulus onset asynchrony ( soa ) between the object image and the noise mask ( 25 ms for image presentation and 25 ms for isi ) .",
    "this soa can disrupt it - v4 ( @xmath11 ms ) and it - v1 ( @xmath12 ms ) feedback signals , while it leaves the feed - forward information sweep intact  @xcite .",
    "using transcranial magnetic stimulation  @xcite , it has been shown that applying magnetic pulses between 30 to 50 ms after stimulus onset will disturb the feed - forward visual information processing in the visual cortex .",
    "thus , soas shorter than 50 ms would make the categorization task much harder by interrupting the feed - forward information flow .",
    "experiments were held in two sessions : in the first one , the objects were presented with a uniform gray background , and in the second one , a randomly selected natural background was used .",
    "some subjects completed two sessions while others only participated in one session , so that each session was performed by 16 subjects .",
    "each experimental session consisted of four blocks ; each one containing 175 images ( in total 700 images ; 100 images per variation level , 20 images from each object category in each level ) .",
    "subjects could rest between blocks for 5 - 10 minutes .",
    "subjects performed a few training trials before starting the actual experiment ( none of the images in these trials were presented in the main experiment ) .",
    "a feedback was shown to subjects during the training trials , indicating whether they responded correctly or not , but not during the main experiment .",
    "* classification accuracy : * to evaluate the classification accuracy of the models , we first randomly selected 600 images from each object category , variation level , and background condition ( see image generation section ) . hence , we have 14 different datasets ( 7 variation levels @xmath13 2 background conditions ) , each of which consists of 3000 images ( 5 categories @xmath13 600 images ) . to compute the accuracy of each dcnn for a given variation level and background condition , we randomly selected two subsets of 1500 training ( 300 images per category ) and 750 testing images ( 150 images per category ) from the corresponding image dataset .",

    "these dissimilarities are measured using spearman s rank correlation distance ( i.e. , @xmath14correlation ) . moreover , rdms is a useful tool to compare different representational spaces with each other . here , we used rdms to compare the internal representations of the models with human behavioral responses ( see below ) . to calculate the rdms",

    "* human rdm : * since we did not have access to the human internal object representations in our psychophysical experiment , we used the human behavioral scores to compute the rdms ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "actually , for each image , we computed the relative frequencies with which the image is assigned to different categories by all human subjects . hence , we have a five - element vector for each image , which is used to construct the human rdm .",
    "although , computing human rdms based on behavioral responses is not a direct measurement of the representational content of the human visual system , it provides a way to compare internal representations of dcnn models to behavioral decisions of humans .",
    "we tested the dcnns in our invariant object categorization task including five object categories , seven variation levels , and two background conditions ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "the categorization accuracy of these models were compared with those of human subjects , performing rapid invariant object categorization tasks on the same images . for each model , variation level , and background condition , we randomly selected 300 training images and 150 testing ones per object category from the corresponding image dataset .",
    "the accuracy was then calculated over 15 random independent runs and the average and standard deviation were reported .",
    "we also analyzed the error distributions of all models and compared them to those of humans .",
    "finally , we compared the representational geometry of models and humans , as a function of the variation levels .",
    "we compared the classification accuracy of the final layer of all models ( dcnns , and hmax representation ) with those of human subjects doing the invariant object categorization tasks in all variation levels and background conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a shows that almost all dcnns achieved human - level accuracy across all levels when objects had a uniform gray background .",
    "the accuracies of dcnns are even better than humans at low ( levels 1 to 3 ) and intermediate ( levels 4 and 5 ) variation levels .",
    "this might be due to inevitable motor errors that humans made during the psychophysical experiment , meaning that subjects might have perceived the image but pressed a wrong key .",
    "also , it can be seen that the accuracies of humans and almost all dcnns are virtually flat across all variation levels which means they are able to invariantly classify objects with uniform background .",
    "surprisingly , the accuracy of overfeat is far below the human - level accuracy , even worse than the hmax model",
    ". this might be due to the structure and the number of features extracted by the overfeat model which leads to a more complex feature space with high redundancy .",
    "we compared the accuracy of humans and models at the most difficult level ( 7 ) .",
    "there is no significant difference between the accuracies of cnn - s , cnn - m , zeiler and fergus , and human at this variation level ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , bar plot ; also , see pairwise comparisons shown using a p - value matrix computed by the wilcoxon rank sum test ) .",
    "cnn - s is the best model .",
    "when we presented object images superimposed on natural backgrounds , the accuracies decreased for both humans and models .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b illustrates that only three dcnns ( cnn - f , cnn - m , cnn - s ) performed close to human .",
    "the accuracy of the hmax model dropped down just above chance level ( i.e. , 20% ) at the seventh variation level .",
    "interestingly , the accuracy of overfeat remained almost constant either in objects on uniform or natural backgrounds , suggesting that this model is more suitable for tasks with unsegmented images .",
    "similarly , we compared the accuracies at the most difficult level ( level 7 ) when objects had natural backgrounds .",
    "again , there is no significant difference between the accuracies of cnn - s , cnn - m , and humans ( see the p - value matrix computed using the wilcoxon rank sum test for all possible pairwise comparisons ) .",
    "however , the accuracy of human subjects is significantly above the hmax model and other dcnns ( i.e. , cnn - f , zeiler and fergus , krizhevsky , hybrid - cnn , and overfeat ) .",
    "dcnns have a hierarchical structure of different processing stages in which each layer extracts a large pool of features ( e.g. , @xmath15 features at top layers ) .",
    "therefore , the computational load of such models is very high .",
    "this raises important questions : what is the contribution of each layer to the final accuracy ? and",
    "how does the accuracy evolve across the layers ?    we addressed these questions by calculating the accuracy of each layer of the models across all variation levels .",
    "this provides us with the contribution of each layer to the final accuracy .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a - h shows the accuracies of all layers and models when objects had uniform gray background .",
    "the accuracies of the pixel representation ( dashed , dark purple curve ) and human ( gray curve ) are also shown on each plot .",
    "overall , the accuracies significantly evolved across layers of dcnns . moreover , almost all layers of the models ( except overfeat ) , even pixel representation , achieved perfect accuracies at low variation levels ( i.e. , levels 1 and 2 ) , suggesting that this task is very simple when objects had small variations and uniform gray background . looking at the intermediate and difficult variation levels shows that the accuracies tend to increase as we go up across the layers .",
    "however , the trend is different between layers and models .",
    "for example , layers 2 , 3 , and 4 in three dcnns ( krizhevsky , hybrid - cnn , zeiler and fergus ) have very similar accuracies across the variation levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , b , and g ) .",
    "similar results can be seen for these models in layers 5 , 6 , and 7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , b , and g ) .",
    "in contrast , there is a high increase in accuracies from layer 1 to 4 for cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s , while the three last layers have similar accuracies .",
    "there is also a gradual increase in the accuracy of overfeat from layer 2 to 5 ( with the similar accuracy for layers 6 , 7 , and 8) ; however , there is a considerable decrease at the output layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) . moreover , the overall accuracy of overfeat is low compared to humans and other models as previously seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "interestingly , the accuracy of hmax , as a shallow model , is far below the accuracies of dcnns ( c2b is the best performing layer ) .",
    "this shows the important role of supervised deep learning in achieving high classification accuracy .",
    "as expected , the accuracy of pixel representation exponentially decreased down to 30% at level seven , confirming the fact that invariant object recognition requires multi - layered architectures ( note that the chance level accuracy is 20% ) .",
    "we note , however , that pixel performs very well with no viewpoint variations ( level 1 ) .",
    "we also compared the accuracies of all layers of the models with those of humans .",
    "color - coded points at the top of each plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicate the p - values of the wilcoxon rank sum test .",
    "the average accuracy of each layer across all variation levels is shown on the pink area at the right side of each plot , summarizing the contribution of each layer to final accuracy independently of variation levels .",
    "horizontal lines on the pink area show whether the average accuracy of each layer is significantly different from those of humans ( black : significant ; white : insignificant ) .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig3]i summarizes the results depicted on the pink areas , confirming that the last three layers in dcnns ( except overfeat ) have similar accuracies .",
    "we also tested the models on objects with natural backgrounds to see whether the contributions of similarly performing layers change in more challenging tasks .",
    "not surprisingly , the accuracy of human subjects dropped by  10% at low variation level ( level 1 ) , and down to  25% at high variation level ( level 7 ) with respect to the uniform background case ( fig .  [ fig4 ] , gray curve ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the pixel representation shows an exponential decline in the accuracy across the levels , with the chance accuracy at level seven ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , dashed dark purple curve ) .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , all dcnns , excluding overfeat , achieved close to human - level accuracy at low variation levels ( levels 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "interestingly , the pixel representation performed better than most models at level one , suggesting that object categorization at low variation level can be done without elaborate feature extraction methods ( note that we had only five object categories , therefore , this can be different with more categories ) .",
    "the severe drop in the accuracy of the hmax model with respect to the uniform background experiment reflects the difficulty of this model to cope with distractors in natural backgrounds . for both background conditions ,",
    "the c2b layer has higher accuracy than c3 layer and can better tolerate object variations .",
    "the main reason why hmax is not performing as well as dcnns is probably the lack of a purposive learning rule  @xcite .",
    "hmax randomly extracts a large number of visual features ( image crops ) which could be highly redundant , uninformative , and even misleading  @xcite .",
    "the issue of inappropriate features becomes more evident when the background is clutter .",
    "another noticeable fact about dcnns in the natural background experiment is the superiority of the last convolutional layers with respect to the fully connected layers ; for example , the accuracy of the fifth layer in the krizhevsky model is higher than the seventh layer s .",
    "one possible reason for the low accuracies in the final layers of dcnns is that the fully connected layers are designed to perform classification themselves , and not to provide input for a svm classifier .",
    "besides , the fully connected layers were optimized for imagenet classification , but not for our dataset . a last reason could be that the convolutional layers have more features than the fully connected layers .",
    "given the accuracies of all layers , it can be seen that the accuracies evolved across the layers .",
    "however , similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , layers 2 , 3 , and 4 of krizhesvky , zeiler and fergus , and hybrid - cnn contribute almost equally to the final accuracy .",
    "again , cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s showed a different trend in terms of the contribution of each layer to the final accuracy .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d - f , only these three models achieved human - level accuracy at difficult levels ( levels 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the accuracies of other dcnns , however , are significantly lower than humans at these levels ( see the color - coded points in fig .  [ fig4]a - c , g which indicate the p - values computed by the wilcoxon rank sum tests ) .",
    "we summarized the average accuracies across all levels for each layer of the models , shown as color - coded circles with error bars on the pink areas next to each plot . in most cases ,",
    "layer 5 ( the last convolutional layer - layer 6 in overfeat ) has the highest accuracy among layers .",
    "this is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4]i , which is actually the summary of results shown on pink areas .",
    "figure  [ fig4]i also confirms that only cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s achieve human - level accuracy .",
    "we further compared the accuracies of all layers of the models with humans at the easy ( level 1 ) , intermediate ( level 4 ) and difficult ( level 7 ) variation levels to see how each layer performs the task as the level of variations increases .",
    "figure  [ fig5]a - c show the accuracies for the uniform background condition .",
    "the easy level is not very informative because of a ceiling effect : all models ( but overfeat ) reach 100% accuracy . at the intermediate level , all dcnns ( except overfeat )",
    "reached the human - level accuracy from layer 4 upwards ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) , suggesting that even with intermediate level of variation , dcnns have remarkable accuracies ( note that objects had uniform background ) .",
    "this is clearly not true for the hmax and overfeat networks .",
    "however , when models were fed with images from the most difficult level , only the last layers ( layers 5 , 6 , and 7 ) achieved human - level accuracy ( see fig .  [",
    "notably the last three layers have almost similar accuracies .",
    "when objects had natural backgrounds , somewhat surprisingly the accuracies of all dcnns ( but overfeat ) is maximal with layer 2 , and drops for subsequent layers .",
    "this shows that deeper is not always better .",
    "the fact that the pixel representation performs well at this level confirms this finding . at the intermediate level",
    ", the picture is different : only the last three layers of dcnns , excluding overfeat , reach human - level accuracy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]e ) . finally , at the seventh variation level , figure  [ fig5]f shows that only three dcnns reach human performance : cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s .    in summary ,",
    "the above results , taken together , illustrate that some dcnns are as accurate as humans , even at the highest variation levels .",
    "the accuracies reported in the previous section only represent the ratio of correct responses . indeed , they did not reflect whether models and humans made similar misclassifications . to do a more precise and category - based comparison between the recognition accuracies of humans and models , we computed the confusion matrices for each variation level .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] provides the confusion matrices for humans and the last layers of all models for both uniform ( see fig .  [",
    "fig6]a ) and natural ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) backgrounds , and for each variation level .        despite a very short presentation time in the behavioral experiment ,",
    "humans performed remarkably well at categorizing five object classes , either when object had uniform ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a , last row ) or natural ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , last row ) backgrounds , with minimum misclassifications across different categories and levels .",
    "it is , however , important to point out that the majority of human errors corresponded to ship - airplane confusions .",
    "this was probably due to the shape similarity among these objects ( e.g. , both categories usually have bodies , sails , wings , etc . ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] demonstrates that the hmax model and pixel representation misclassified almost all categories at high variation levels . with natural backgrounds",
    ", they uniformly assigned input images into different classes .",
    "conversely , dcnns show few classification errors across different categories and levels , though the distribution of errors is different from one model to another .",
    "for example , the majority of recognition errors made by krizehvsy , zeiler and fergus , and hybrid - cnn belonged to car and motorcycle classes , while animal and airplane classes were mostly misclassified by cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s .",
    "finally , overfeat shows evenly - distributed errors across categories , confirming its low accuracy .",
    "we also examined whether models decisions are similar to those of humans .",
    "to this end , we computed the similarity between the humans confusion matrices and those of the models . an important point is to factor out the impacts of the mean accuracies ( of humans and models ) on the similarity measure , to only take the error distributions into account .",
    "therefore , for each confusion matrix , we first excluded the diagonal terms and arranged the remaining elements in a vector and normalized it by its _",
    "l2 _ norm .",
    "then , the similarity between two confusion matrices is computed using the euclidean distance between their corresponding vectors subtracted from one ( here we call it as _ 1 - norm . euclidean distance _ ) . in this way",
    ", we are just comparing the error distributions of humans and models independent of their accuracies .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] provides the similarities between models and humans across all layers and levels when objects had uniform background .",
    "almost all models , including the pixel representation , show the maximum possible similarity at low variation levels ( levels 1 and 2 ) .",
    "however , the similarity of pixel representation exponentially decreases from level 2 upwards .",
    "overall , the highest layers of dcnns ( except overfeat ) are more similar to humans decisions .",
    "this point is also shown in figure  [ fig7]i , which represents the average similarities across all variation levels ( each curve corresponds to one model ) .",
    "note that due to the high recognition accuracies in uniform background condition , this level of similarity was predictable .",
    "the similarity between models and humans errors , however , decreases in the case of images with natural backgrounds .",
    "the hmax model had the lowest similiarity with human ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "although dcnns have reached human - level accuracy , their decisions and distribution of errors are different from human s .",
    "interestingly , the overfeat has almost a constant similarity across layers and levels . comparing the similarities across dcnns shows that cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s have the highest similarities to humans , which is also reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig8]i .    to summarize our results so far : the best dcnns",
    "can reach human performance even at the highest variation level , but their error distributions are different to the average human one ( similarity @xmath16 1 on fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "however , one needs a reference here , because humans also differ between each other .",
    "are these difference between humans smaller than differences between humans and dcnns ?",
    "to investigate this issue , we used the multidimensional scaling ( mds ) method to visualize the distances ( i.e. , similarities ) between the confusion matrices of humans and models ( last layer ) in 2-d maps ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "each map corresponds to a certain variation level and background condition .    in the uniform background condition ,",
    "humans have small inter - subject distances .",
    "as we move from low to high variations , the distance between dcnns and humans becomes greater . in high variation levels , the overfeat , hmax , and pixel models are very far from the human subjects as well as from the other dcnns .",
    "the other models remain indiscernible from humans .    in the natural background condition ,",
    "the human between - subject distances are relatively higher than in the uniform condition . as the level of variations increases , the models tend to get further away from the human subjects .",
    "but the cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s are difficult , if not impossible , to discern from humans .",
    "so far , we have analyzed the accuracies and error distributions of models and humans , when features were used by a svm classifier .",
    "however , such analyses do not inform us about the internal representational geometry of models and their similarities to those of humans .",
    "it is very important to investigate how different categories are represented in the feature space .",
    "representational similarity analysis has become a popular tool to study the internal representation of models  @xcite in response to different object categories .",
    "the representational geometries of models can then be compared with neural responses independently of the recording modality ( e.g. fmri  @xcite , cell recording  @xcite , behavior  @xcite , and meg  @xcite ) , showing to what degree each model resembles the brain representations . here , we calculated representational dissimilarity matrices ( rdm ) for models and humans  @xcite .",
    "we then compared the rdms of humans and each model and quantified the similarity between these two .",
    "model rdms were calculated based on pairwise correlation between the feature vectors of two images ( see materials and methods ) . to calculate the human rdm",
    ", we used their behavioral scores recorded in the psychophysical experiment ( see materials and methods as well as  @xcite ) .",

    "note that these rdms are calculated from the object representations in the last layers of the models .",
    "for better visualization , we show only 20 images from each category ; therefore , the size of rdms is @xmath17 ( reported rdms were averaged over six random runs ) .",

    "[ fig10]a and fig .",
    "[ fig10]b for uniform and natural backgrounds , respectively ) .",
    "however , both hmax and pixel representation show a random pattern in their rdms when objects had natural backgrounds ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]b , rows 8 and 9 ) , suggesting that such low and intermediate visual features are unable to invariantly represent different object categories .",
    "the situation is slightly better when object had uniform background ( fig .",

    ", there is some categorical information , mostly across low variation levels ( levels 1 to 3 , and 4 to some extent ) , for animal , motorcycle , and airplane images . such information is attenuated at intermediate and high variation levels .",
    "in contrast , dcnns demonstrate clear categorical information for different objects across almost all levels , for both background conditions .",
    "categorical information is more evident when objects had uniform background , even at high variation levels , while this information almost disappears at intermediate levels when object had natural backgrounds .",
    "in addition , overfeat did not clearly represent different object categories .",
    "the overfeat model is one of the most powerful dcnns with high accuracy on the imagenet database , but it seems that the features are not suitable for our invariant object recognition task .",
    "it uses no fewer than 230400 features !",
    "this might be one reason for poor representational power : it probably leads to a nested and complex object representation .",
    "besides , this high number of features may also explain the poor classification performance we obtained , due to overfitting .",
    "based on visual inspection , it seems that some dcnns are better at representing some specific categories .",
    "for example , krizhevsky , hybrid - cnn , zeiler and fergus could better represent animal , car and airplane classes ( lower within - class dissimilarity for these categories ) , while ship and motorcycle classes are better represented by cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s .",
    "interestingly , this has been reflected on the confusion matrix analysis , suggesting that combining and remixing of features from these dcnns could result in a more robust invariant object representation  @xcite .    to quantify the similarity between models and humans rdms , we calculated the correlation between them across all layers and levels ( measured as kendall @xmath18 rank correlation ) .",

    "[ fig12 ] ) backgrounds indicates that the maximum correlation ( @xmath19 at level 1 ) did not change a lot .",
    "however , for the uniform background condition , the correlation across other levels increased to some extent . besides",

    "note that the correlation values of the first layer of almost all dcnns ( but zeiler and fergus ) are similar to those of pixel representation , suggesting that in the absence of viewpoint variations , very simple features ( i.e. , gray values of pixels ) can achieve acceptable accuracy and correlation .",
    "this means that dcnns are built to perform more complex recognition tasks , as it has been shown in several studies .",
    "not surprisingly , in the case of natural background , the correlation between pixel and human rdms are very low and almost insignificant at all levels ( fig .",

    "it is worth noting that the best models in terms of performance , cnn - f , cnn - m , and cnn - s do not have the most human - like rdms .",

    "we also computed the category separability index for the internal representations of each model by computing the ratio of within - category relative to between - category dissimilarities ( results are not shown here).this experiment also confirms that models with higher separability indexes do not necessarily perform better than other models .",

    "results illustrated that accuracies tend to increase as images are processed through the layers ; however , some layers achieved very similar accuracies . if some layers do not considerably contribute to the final accuracy , at least in our task , one is tempted to remove it , to reduce the computational load of the dcnn , which is typically very high .",
    "for example it has been shown that eliminating one of the middle layers leads to just 2% accuracy drop in krizhevsky model on the imagenet database  @xcite .",
    "more research is needed to systematically evaluate the role of different layers by removing each layer and evaluating the resulting accuracy . however , this should be done using different image databases since these dcnns were optimized for imagenet database . therefore , the layer - specific effect might be database dependent .",

    "this confirms the success of these computational models to mimic the performance of the visual neural circuits in such a difficult task .",
    "when variation level is high , shallow networks have low accuracies , while as we move through the layers of dcnns the invariance gradually increase in such a way that the very deep network ( with 19 layers ) can even outperform the humans .",
    "another important point is that both 2-d and 3-d variations could be handled by 2-d features extracted through the layers of dcnns .",
    "although some 2-d variations , such as position , are treated through many convolutional layers ( using shared - weight filters in different positions ) , dcnns do not have any built - in mechanism to overcome 3-d variations ( such as in - depth - rotation ) .",
    "thus , these invariances must be learned .",
    "regarding to different theories of how the brain reaches 3-d invariance , our results suggest that 3-d rotation invariance can be achieved using 2-d features and not necessarily by construction of 3-d object models . however , the difference between the error distributions and object representations of dcnns and humans suggest that they use different information to handle invariant object recognition , presumably due to structural and learning differences .",
    "the human visual system exploits feedback signals , bottom - up and top - down attentions , continuous visual information , and temporal learning .",
    "so if using more layers can substantially improve the performance of machine vision algorithms , adding other properties of the visual system can make more advances .",
    "this could , in reverse , give important clues about the nature of neural processing in the visual cortex .",

    "nevertheless , overfeat that exploits extensively more features in these layers had troubles with invariant object recognition .",

    "although it is not clear why some dcnns perform better than others , our results suggest that networks with deeper architecture , and convolutional layers with small filter size but with more feature planes can achieve higher performances . in any case",
    ", an extensive optimization is required to find the best architecture and parameter settings for dcnns .",
    "it is also important to point out that despite utilizing similar architectures but different training datasets , keizhevsky and hybrid - cnn models had close performances .",
    "these results suggest that architecture is more important than the training set .",
    "hence , future studies should focus on how to evaluate different architectures to find the optimum one .",
    "[ [ dcnns - lack - important - processing - mechanisms - that - exist - in - biological - vision ] ] dcnns lack important processing mechanisms that exist in biological vision ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we tried to only allow feed - forward processing in our psychophysical experiment by using short presentation time and backward masking , weakening the effect of back projections .",
    "however , this does not completely rule out the effects of feedback connections in the visual system .",
    "conversely , dcnns are feed - forward only models without any feedback mechanisms from upper to lower layers ( note that error back propagation is not considered as a feedback mechanism because it only occurs during the learning , not the recognition ) . adding a feedback mechanism to dcnns could increase their performance , and this could be useful for complex visual tasks ( e.g. , variation level 7 in our data ) .",
    "this would inevitably increases the computational load of dcnns and that might be the reason why dcnns still lack a feedback mechanism .",
    "another issue is how to learn feedback connections .",
    "in addition to object recognition , feedback connections plays a pivotal role in other visual processes such as figure - ground segregation  @xcite , spatial and feature - based attention  @xcite , and perceptual learning  @xcite . as shown in our results ,",
    "the accuracies of dcnns significantly drops in case of objects with natural backgrounds .",
    "this could be due to the lack of a figure - ground segregation in the models .",
    "indeed , the primate visual system is able to separate the parts of image which belong to the target object from the background and other objects .",
    "it has been suggested that recurrent processing is required for the completion of figure - ground segregation ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "also , the mechanisms of bottom - up and top - down attention in the human visual system emphasizes the most salient and relevant parts of the images , which contain more information and can facilitate the categorization process .",
    "several studies  @xcite have shown that recurrent processing can enhance object representations in it and facilitate invariant object recognition .",
    "dcnns lack such mechanisms , and they could help to increase the recognition accuracy , especially in cluttered images and this could be another direction for future improvement of dcnns .",
    "our image database has several advantages for studying invariant object recognition .",
    "firstly , it contains a large number of object images , changing across different levels of variations of position , scale , and in - depth and in - plane rotations , and background .",
    "secondly , we had a precise control over the amount of variations that let us generate images with different degrees of complexity / difficulty ; therefore , enabling us to scrutinize the behavior of humans and computational models , while the complexity of object variations gradually increases .",
    "thirdly , similar to several studies  @xcite , by eliminating dependencies between objects and backgrounds , we were able to study invariance , independently of contextual effects .",
    "however , there are several effective parameters in invariant object recognition for both humans and models that should be further investigated .",
    "it is important to explore how the consistency between objects and surrounding environment would affect the object recognition process  @xcite and it should be further studied in invariant object recognition . also , other parameters such as illumination , contrast , texture , noise , and occlusion need to be investigated in controlled experiments .",
    "another important question that needs to be clearly addressed is whether all types of variations impose the same difficulty to humans and models .",
    "a simple and short answer is  no \" ; however , it remains unclear which types of variation are more challenging , what the underlying mechanisms for it are .",
    "it has been shown that the brain responds differently to different types of object variations .",
    "for instance , scale invariant responses appear faster than position invariant ones  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , scale invariant responses in the human brain emerge early in development while view invariance responses tend to emerge later , suggesting that simple processes such as scale invariance could be built - in , while we would need more training to perform view invariant object recognition  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important , for both neuroscientists and computational modelers , to understand how the brain deals with different types of variations . from a computer vision point of view",
    ", it seems that 3-d variations ( e.g. , rotations in - depth ) are more challenging than 2-d transformations ( e.g. , changes in position and scale )  @xcite . due to the structure of dcnns and the computations performed in such networks , they easily tackle with changes in position and , to some extent , in the scale of the objects .",
    "however , there is no built - in mechanism for invariance to 3-d transformations .",
    "adding such a mechanism to the models should increase their accuracy as well as their resemblance to neurophysiological data .",
    "a very recent modeling study  @xcite , inspired by physiological data from monkeys brain , shows that adding a view invariance mechanism to a feed - forward model can surprisingly explain face processing in monkey face patches  @xcite .",

    "<S> deep convolutional neural networks ( dcnns ) have attracted much attention recently , and have shown to be able to recognize thousands of object categories in natural image databases . </S>",
    "<S> their architecture is somewhat similar to that of the human visual system : both use restricted receptive fields , and a hierarchy of layers which progressively extract more and more abstracted features . yet </S>",
    "<S> it is unknown whether dcnns match human performance at the task of view - invariant object recognition , whether they make similar errors and use similar representations for this task , and whether the answers depend on the magnitude of the viewpoint variations . to investigate these issues , we benchmarked eight state - of - the - art dcnns , the hmax model , and a baseline shallow model and compared their results to those of humans with backward masking . unlike in all previous dcnn studies , we carefully controlled the magnitude of the viewpoint variations to demonstrate that shallow nets can outperform deep nets and humans when variations are weak . when facing larger variations , however , more layers were needed to match human performance and error distributions , and to have representations that are consistent with human behavior . a very deep net with 18 layers even outperformed humans at the highest variation level , using the most human - like representations . </S>"
