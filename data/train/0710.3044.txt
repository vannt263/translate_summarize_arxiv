    "consider a communication network which is represented by an undirected graph @xmath0 with edge costs @xmath1 . within this network there is a set of @xmath2 terminals @xmath3 which want to communicate with each other .",
    "however , the exact amount of traffic between pairs of terminals is not known in advance .",
    "instead , each terminal @xmath4 has an upper bound @xmath5 on the cumulative amount of traffic that terminal @xmath6 can send or receive .",
    "the general aim is to install capacities on the edges of the graph supporting any possible communication scenario at minimum cost where the cost for installing one unit of capacity on edge @xmath7 is @xmath8 .    a _ set of traffic demands _",
    "@xmath9 specifies for each unordered pair of terminals @xmath10 the amount @xmath11 of traffic between @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "a set @xmath13 is _ valid _ if it respects the upper bounds on the traffic of the terminals .",
    "that is , ( setting @xmath14 for all @xmath4 ) @xmath15    a solution to the _ symmetric virtual private network design _ ( svpnd ) problem defined by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 consists of an @xmath6-@xmath12-path @xmath20 in @xmath16 for each unordered pair @xmath10 , and edge capacities @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "such a set of paths @xmath20 , @xmath10 , together with edge capacities @xmath23 , @xmath22 , is called a _ virtual private network_. a virtual private network is _ feasible _ if all valid sets of traffic demands @xmath13 can be routed without exceeding the installed capacities @xmath24 where all traffic between terminals @xmath6 and @xmath12 is routed along path @xmath20 , that is , ( with @xmath25 denoting the set of cardinality - two subsets of  @xmath18 ) @xmath26 a feasible virtual private network is called _ optimal _ if the total cost of the capacity reservation @xmath27 is minimal .    a well - known open question is whether the svpndproblem can be solved efficiently ( i.e. , in polynomial time ) ; see erlebach and regg @xcite and italiano , leonardi , and oriolo @xcite . a feasible virtual private network is a _ tree solution _ if the subgraph of @xmath16 induced by the support of @xmath24 ( i.e. , edges @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) is a tree .",
    "gupta , kleinberg , kumar , rastogi , and yener @xcite prove that a tree solution of minimum cost can be obtained in polynomial time by an all - pair shortest paths computation on the network @xmath16 . in figure",
    "[ fig : tree - reservation ] we explain how optimal ( i.e. , minimal ) capacities can be determined for a fixed sub - tree of  @xmath16 spanning all terminals .    in the following",
    "we assume that capacities are chosen accordingly in any tree solution .",
    "although many different ( groups of ) researchers are working on the svpndproblem , there is no instance known where a tree solution of minimum cost is not simultaneously an optimal virtual private network .",
    "it is widely believed that the following conjecture holds .",
    "[ con:0 ] for each svpndinstance @xmath30 there exists an optimal virtual private network which is a tree solution .    the only progress in this direction is due to hurkens , keijsper , and stougie @xcite who prove that conjecture  [ con:0 ] holds on ring networks and for some other special cases of the problem .",
    "their results are based on a linear programming ( lp ) formulation of a relaxation of the svpndproblem . in this relaxation",
    "several paths may be chosen between each pair of terminals but the fraction of traffic along each of these paths must be fixed , i.e. , it may not depend on the actual set of traffic demands .",
    "hurkens , keijsper , and stougie construct solutions to the dual linear program whose cost equals the cost of particular tree solutions .",
    "the details of their proof are somewhat involved .    in the following",
    "we present a simpler proof of this result that is based on a new and stronger conjecture which might be of independent interest . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we argue that we can restrict to instances with unit communication bounds .",
    "our new conjecture is presented in section  [ sec : pr ] .",
    "finally we give a short proof for the case of ring networks in section  [ sec : ring ] .",
    "as already observed in @xcite , when proving conjecture  [ con:0 ] , we may assume that @xmath31 for each terminal @xmath4 .",
    "for the sake of self - containedness , we motivate this assumption in the following . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .    consider a terminal @xmath4 with @xmath32 ; see figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( i ) for an example .",
    "we construct a new svpndinstance by replacing terminal @xmath6 with @xmath33 `` _ _ sub - terminals _ _ ''",
    "@xmath34 with @xmath35 for @xmath36 that are all collocated at the same node @xmath37 ; see figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( ii )",
    ". strictly speaking , the collocation of terminals at a node is a slight extension of the original definition of the svpndproblem .",
    "we show how to deal with this below .    obviously , the new instance is a relaxation of the original instance .",
    "the additional degree of freedom of the new instance is that traffic from terminal @xmath6 to some other terminal no longer needs to be routed along one fixed path but may be split into @xmath33 packets of equal size that can be routed along different ( but also fixed ) paths .    in order to show that there exists an optimal virtual private network for the original instance which is a tree , it is obviously sufficient to find such an optimal solution to the new instance .",
    "we finally argue that the new instance is itself equivalent to an svpndinstance ( in the strict sense ) with all @xmath33 s equal to @xmath38 . instead of having @xmath33 sub - terminals located at node  @xmath6 , we add new terminal nodes @xmath34 to the network and connect them to node @xmath6 with edges of cost  @xmath39 ; see figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iii ) .",
    "it is easy to observe that every feasible ( tree ) solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( ii ) naturally corresponds to a feasible ( tree ) solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iii ) of the same cost and vice versa .",
    "the only problem with the described approach is that the resulting network no longer has the same topology as the network of the original instance .",
    "for example , if we start with a ring network , the resulting network in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iii ) is not a ring .",
    "this problem can be resolved by using the alternative construction illustrated in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iv ) .",
    "here we subdivide an arbitrary edge  @xmath7 incident to node  @xmath6 into  @xmath40 parts by introducing  @xmath33 new terminal nodes @xmath34 .",
    "the first @xmath33 edges connecting the new terminal nodes to node  @xmath6 have cost  @xmath39 . to the last edge we assign cost  @xmath8 .",
    "again , it is easy to observe that every feasible solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( ii ) naturally corresponds to a feasible solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iv ) of the same cost and vice versa .    in order to argue that also tree solutions correspond to each other",
    ", one has to be a little more careful .",
    "notice that not every tree solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iv ) induces a tree solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( ii ) ( e.g. , if terminals  @xmath41 and  @xmath42 are leaves of the tree ) .",
    "but there always exists an _",
    "optimal _ tree solution to the instance in figure  [ fig : splitting ]  ( iv ) containing all edges @xmath43 .",
    "this follows from the fact that these edges have cost  @xmath39 and an optimal tree solution is a shortest - paths tree for some source node  @xmath44 ; see  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with the following lemma resulting from our considerations above .",
    "[ lem : b=1 ] consider a class of networks which is closed under the operation of subdividing edges by introducing new nodes of degree  @xmath45 .",
    "then conjecture  [ con:0 ] holds for this class of networks if and only if it holds for the restricted class of instances on such networks where  @xmath31 for all  @xmath4 .",
    "consider again a tree solution to an svpndinstance as depicted in figure  [ fig : tree - reservation ] with @xmath46 terminals and @xmath31 for all terminals  @xmath4 .",
    "for a fixed terminal  @xmath4 , let  @xmath47 denote the set of simple paths @xmath20 in the tree that connect @xmath6 to the remaining terminals @xmath48 .",
    "notice that the required capacity of edge @xmath7 can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of paths in @xmath47 containing edge  @xmath7 , that is , @xmath51 see also figure  [ fig : concave_cost ] .",
    "we now introduce another problem that we call _ pyramidal routing _ ( pr ) problem .",
    "the problem is defined by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18as above for the svpndproblem  and a _ single source terminal _",
    "a solution to the pyramidal routing problem consists of a set @xmath47 of _ simple _ @xmath6-@xmath12-paths @xmath20 , one path for each terminal @xmath48 . as above",
    "we denote the number of paths in @xmath47 containing a fixed edge @xmath22 by @xmath50 ; see .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath52 accordingly as in .",
    "the prproblem is to find a solution @xmath47 that minimizes the objective function @xmath53    the prproblem can be seen as an unsplittable flow problem with concave cost functions on the edges ( see figure  [ fig : concave_cost ] ) where one unit of flow is sent from the source  @xmath6 to all destinations  @xmath48 .",
    "a _ tree solution _ to pris a solution where the chosen paths @xmath20 , @xmath48 , form a tree .",
    "[ lem : tree - solutions ] consider an svpndinstance @xmath30 with  @xmath54 for all  @xmath55 and a corresponding prinstance @xmath56 for some terminal @xmath4 .",
    "then any tree solution to the svpndinstance yields a tree solution of the same cost to the prinstance and vice versa .    consider any subtree of @xmath16 containing all terminals . the induced set of @xmath6-@xmath12-paths , @xmath48 , is @xmath47 . for the svpndproblem , the required capacity of some tree edge",
    "@xmath7 is equal to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the cost of this tree solution is equal to @xmath58 for both problems .",
    "we state an immediate corollary of the last lemma .",
    "[ cor : pr - trees ] a tree solution of minimum cost to a prinstance @xmath56 yields simultaneously a tree solution of ( the same ) minimum cost to the prinstances @xmath59 for all  @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , @xmath60 where @xmath47 and @xmath61 denote the two sets of paths connecting terminal @xmath6 and @xmath12 , respectively , with all other terminals .",
    "we state the following conjecture for the pyramidal routing problem .    [",
    "con : pr ] for each prinstance @xmath56 there exists an optimal solution which is a tree solution .    as we show in the remainder of this section , conjecture  [ con : pr ] is strongly related to conjecture  [ con:0 ] .",
    "[ thm : equivalent - conj ] if conjecture  [ con : pr ] holds on some class of networks , which is closed under the operation of subdividing edges by introducing new nodes of degree  @xmath45 , then conjecture  [ con:0 ] holds on the same class .",
    "before we can prove this theorem we need one further result .",
    "the following lemma and its proof are a slight extension of theorem 3.2 in  @xcite .",
    "[ lem:1 ] consider an svpndinstance @xmath30 with @xmath62 for all @xmath55 and some feasible virtual private network given by simple @xmath6-@xmath12-paths @xmath20 , @xmath10 , and capacities @xmath23 , @xmath22 . there exists a terminal @xmath4 such that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "we first consider some fixed edge @xmath22 . in order to derive a lower bound on @xmath23",
    ", we define a set of traffic demands @xmath65 by setting @xmath66    [ cla:1 ] @xmath65 is a set of valid traffic demands .",
    "we need to show that @xmath67 for each @xmath4 .",
    "remember that @xmath57 . by definition of @xmath65",
    "we thus get @xmath68 the last equation follows since @xmath69 .    [ cla:2 ] @xmath70  .",
    "we know from the previous claim that @xmath65 is a valid set of traffic demands .",
    "moreover , by definition , @xmath71 implies @xmath72 .",
    "therefore @xmath73 since @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",
    "since claim  [ cla:2 ] holds for all @xmath22 , it follows that @xmath76 this concludes the proof of the lemma",
    ".    we can now prove theorem  [ thm : equivalent - conj ] .",
    "consider an svpndinstance @xmath30 with  @xmath54 for all  @xmath55 ; this can be assumed without loss of generality due to lemma [ lem : b=1 ] .",
    "consider an optimal solution to the instance . by lemma  [ lem:1 ] there",
    "exists a terminal @xmath4 such that the optimal solution value of the prinstance @xmath56 is a lower bound on the optimal solution value of the svpndinstance .",
    "if conjecture  [ con : pr ] holds for the prinstance , there exists an optimal tree solution to the prinstance which , by lemma  [ lem : tree - solutions ] , also yields an optimal virtual private network .",
    "in this section we prove conjecture  [ con : pr ] for the case that @xmath16 is an arbitrary ring network , i.e. , a cycle .",
    "consider a prinstance @xmath56 where @xmath16 is a cycle .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that each node @xmath77 is a terminal , i.e. , @xmath78 : if there is a non - terminal node @xmath79 with two neighbors @xmath80 , we can remove  @xmath79 and replace edges @xmath81 and @xmath82 by a new edge @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath88 be the terminal that is incident to both @xmath7 and @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath90 , exactly one path in @xmath47 ( namely the @xmath6-@xmath12-path ) ends in @xmath12 .",
    "all other paths either contain both edges @xmath7 and @xmath89 or none of the two .",
    "if  @xmath86 , the claim follows immediately from claim  [ claim1 ] .",
    "we can therefore assume that @xmath7 and @xmath89 are the two edges incident to terminal @xmath6 .",
    "since there are exactly @xmath92 simple paths in @xmath47 starting at @xmath6 , we get @xmath93 .",
    "the result follows by definition of @xmath52 and @xmath94 ; see .      *",
    "first case : * @xmath2 is even . since @xmath93 for the two edges @xmath7 and @xmath89 incident to @xmath6 , we can assume that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "going along the cycle , it follows from claim  [ claim1 ] that there exists an edge  @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "we number the edges along the cycle consecutively @xmath99 . using claim  [ claim2 ]",
    "inductively , it follows that @xmath100 see figure  [ fig : cycle ] .",
    "removing edge @xmath101 from the cycle yields a tree and a corresponding tree solution @xmath102 to the prinstance .",
    "moreover , we argue that @xmath103 by corollary  [ cor : pr - trees ] we can assume without loss of generality that terminal  @xmath6 is incident to edge  @xmath97 .",
    "but in this case @xmath104 and thus @xmath105 for  @xmath106 .",
    "* second case : * @xmath2 is odd . in this case",
    "it follows from claims  [ claim1 ] and [ claim2 ] that there exist two incident edges that we call  @xmath108 and @xmath109 with @xmath110 we number the edges along the cycle consecutively @xmath111 . using claim  [ claim2 ]",
    "inductively , it follows that @xmath112 the remainder of the proof is identical to the first case .",
    "we conclude the paper with some remarks and observations .",
    "first , in the definition of the pyramidal routing problem we might relax the constraints that the paths have to be simple and allow _ trails _ ; a trail may visit nodes ( but not edges ) more than once .",
    "it is easy to see that lemma [ lem : tree - solutions ] , lemma [ lem:1 ] , and theorem [ thm : equivalent - conj ] still hold .",
    "( observe that on a ring a path is a trail and vice versa . )",
    "then , in their paper @xcite , hurkens , keijsper , and stougie prove a result that is slightly stronger than corollary  [ cor : vpn - conj ] .",
    "consider the relaxation of the svpndproblem where traffic between each pair of terminals may be routed along several different paths but the fraction of traffic along each of these paths must be fixed .",
    "using the notation from @xcite , we refer to the relaxed problem as the multipath routing ( mr ) problem .",
    "hurkens et al .",
    "show that , for the case of ring networks , even mrhas always an optimal solution which is a tree solution .",
    "we observe that this stronger result holds in general if conjecture  [ con:0 ] is true .",
    "consider a class of networks which is closed under the operation of subdividing edges by introducing new nodes of degree  @xmath45 .",
    "if conjecture  [ con:0 ] holds for this class of networks , then also the mrproblem has optimal solutions which are tree solutions for this class of networks .",
    "as the @xmath33 are integers and there is only a finite number of sets of paths",
    "one finds that the fractionalities in the solution to the mrproblem can be restricted to be rationals with bounded denominators for every particular instance of the mrproblem .",
    "subdividing the terminals as in section 2 by a number of nodes depending on a bound on these denominators one constructs an svpndinstance whose optimal ( tree ) solution yields an optimal ( tree ) solution to the original instance of the mrproblem .",
