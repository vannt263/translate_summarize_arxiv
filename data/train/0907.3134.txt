    "the potential in both fundamental and applied research has stimulated an outgrowing interest in the physical community to study the effects of the dynamical crossing of quantum critical points  @xcite . at such points ,",
    "the correlation length of the system diverges , and the characteristic energy gap between the ground state and the lowest lying excitations vanishes . accordingly , adiabatic evolution is precluded , and any dynamical quench across the critical point is accompanied by a production of excitations in the system . as a result",
    ", the final state will only be partially ordered , displaying a non - vanishing density of defects imported from the quantum disordered into the ordered phases .",
    "such density of defects is uniquely determined by the universality class of the system , and can be accurately described by the so - called kibble - zurek scaling ( kz )  @xcite .",
    "the kz scaling was formerly proposed as the mechanism underlying topological defect production in a cosmological scenario  @xcite , or in classical phase transitions occurring at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "the extension of the kz mechanism to the quantum domain was proposed in  @xcite , and numerically confirmed in the transverse ising model , a cornerstone in the theory of quantum phase transitions .",
    "this result paved the way to a considerable amount of works dealing with defect production in the zero - temperature regime  @xcite , which showed that the kz scenario also holds for quantum phase transitions ( see  @xcite for an experiment ) .",
    "modifications to the characteristic scaling laws have been studied in order to account for non - linear quenches  @xcite , crossing of multi - critical points  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent proposal on the implementation of tri - critical points in trapped ions ) , quenches across a critical region  @xcite , or along a gapless line  @xcite .",
    "the effect of classical noise on the driving parameter has also been studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite",

    "we consider a set of majorana fermions ( i.e. real fermions ) arranged in a one - dimensional chain  @xcite .",
    "we shall describe the deviations of the standard kz scaling , and identify the necessary ingredients to obtain robustness of edge states even in a critical region by resorting to the experience gained with the creutz ladder  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to boundary conditions generically indicates that a non trivial topological order is encoded into the system .",
    "this is specified by the presence of states localized at the boundaries of the system , the so - called edge states  @xcite .",
    "note also that topological edge states arise naturally in a wide variety of systems , such as one - dimensional spin models  @xcite , the integer and fractional quantum hall effects ( qhe )  @xcite , and have been experimentally realized on topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "the subtle difference between trivial and topological insulators ( ti ) is rooted on the non - trivial topological features of the bulk bands of the latter , such as non - vanishing chern numbers in the integer qhe  @xcite .",
    "ti represent an intriguing state of matter , where edge - transport exists even in the presence of an insulating bulk gap  @xcite .",
    "these edge states are usually localized in the interface that separates two topologically distinct insulators , the simplest example being the interface between an iqhe sample and the vacuum  @xcite . besides , they connect the conduction and valence bands and allow for conduction along the interface .",
    "other interesting ti are the anomalous half - integer qhe in the honeycomb  @xcite or square lattices  @xcite , and those ones characterized by @xmath1 topological invariants  @xcite which lead to the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "depending on the symmetries of the hamiltonian and the dimension of the system , ti can be classified in a periodic table  @xcite . accordingly , one of the simplest ti is the one - dimensional chain of majorana fermions  @xcite , where edge states correspond to bound majorana fermions localized at the chain ends .",

    "remarkably , the whole quench dynamics can be expressed as a collection of uncoupled two - level systems , each associated to a nambu spinor @xmath66 .",

    "however , since we are interested in the comparison of initial single - particle bulk- , or edge - states , we shall refer to the probability to create defects @xmath76 rather than to a thermodynamical density .",

    "let us note that this state also crosses the critical point at the gapless mode energy , and thus one would expect a similar kz - scaling to hold @xmath61 .",
    "note however , that the obtained scaling ( fig .",
    "[ edge_kz ] ) completely disagrees @xmath83 , and offers thus further evidence of the anomalous defect production for localized edge states  @xcite . the departure from the universal",
    "kz - scaling is drastic for such majorana fermions . besides",
    ", it predicts that the edge state robustness is lost as the critical point is crossed ( i.e. @xmath84 both for positive- and negative - energy bands ) .",
    "the underlying reason for such a departure is that the edge state at the critical point can be expressed as a linear combination of the gapless modes @xmath85 , and thus fuses into the bulk bands .",
    "indeed , we show in the next section that in the thermodynamical limit @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the fermionic creation operators of positive- and negative - energy solutions associated to the mode @xmath88 ( see eq .   ) .",
    "therefore , the initially unpaired majorana at the left edge , becomes completely delocalized along the upper chain of the rung ( see fig .  [ edge_adiab ] ) at criticality @xmath44 .",
    "being uniformly delocalized , it overlaps with bulk excitations with well - defined momenta @xmath85 , and therefore completely fuses in the continuum bands . in this regard ,",
    "the majorana character of the initial state is completely lost across the quantum critical point , and one can not further transport the majorana to the right - hand side ( i.e. @xmath89 ) .    due to the finite number of modes coupled to the edge states , this",
    "anomalous dynamics might be viewed as a saturation effect , such as that one studied in the xy model [ 26 ] .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that the effect presented in this work traces back indeed to the topological order of the system , since it only occurs for the unpaired majorana edge states . in a trivial insulator , where in - gap edge states are simply absent ,",
    "we should have restricted to bulk plaquette - like excitations which do not lead to any anomaly in kz scaling .",
    "let us now compare these results with the edge - state defect production in the creutz model , a ladder of usual fermions pierced by a perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite . in this system , a quench of the magnetic flux drives the fermions across a quantum phase transition of the same universality class @xmath90 .",
    "similarly to the majorana chain , the defect production for initial bulk states fulfills @xmath91 in accordance to the kz - scaling .",
    "this result emphasizes the fact that both models , being microscopically different , belong to the same universality class .",
    "conversely , edge states in the creutz ladder fulfill @xmath92 , which completely deviates from the kz prediction , and from the defect production of a majorana chain @xmath93 .",
    "this result gives further evidence of the conjecture on the non - universality of the edge state dynamics across a critical point , as raised in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the result on the creutz ladder highlights the resilience of edge states due to a quantum interference phenomenon that allows them to remain well - localized at the boundaries of the lattice .",
    "conversely , majorana edge states become completely delocalized at the critical point , and this leads to a higher sensitivity at criticality @xmath93 .",
    "we can draw the conclusion that edge state robustness is non - universal , and is intimately related to edge state localization .      here",
    ", we show how the unpaired majoranas , initially localized at the chain edges , become completely delocalized over the whole chain",
    "when the critical point @xmath44 is achieved . besides , we show that such delocalized states overlap with the continuum modes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath81 , and thus justify the scaling @xmath94 .",
    "remarkably , the zero - energy modes associated to unpaired majoranas can be analytically obtained in the whole regime @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and read as follows @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are normalization constants .",
    "note that the exponential tail of the edge states fulfill @xmath100 in the regime of interest .",
    "in particular , at the initial point @xmath41 , one can easily check that these edge states become completely localized at the edge rungs and coincide with eqs .  .",
    "conversely , at criticality @xmath44 , the majoranas become uniformly delocalized along each chain forming the virtual rung @xmath101 its precisely at this critical point where they overlap with the bulk gapless modes ( see eq .  ) , and thus @xmath102 consequently , the edge states will not follow the adiabatic path that would connect them to the edge majoranas at @xmath71 , but rather fuse into the positive- and negative - energy bulk bands .",
    "this explains the anomalous scaling @xmath84 for edge states ( note also that the probability to decay into the negative energy band would be @xmath103 ) .",
    "in this article , we have described the quench dynamics of a 1d - lattice model with unpaired majorana fermions bound to the boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the transport of majorana fermions between the edges of the chain is hampered by the loss of adiabaticity at the quantum critical point .",
    "the main conclusion drawn from this work is two - fold : edge - state dynamics across a critical point is not universal , and the robustness / fragility of the latter relies on their localization at criticality .",
    "we have found that the scaling of defects deviates from the usual kibble - zurek paradigm , and is non - universal .",
    "indeed , the creutz ladder  @xcite and the majorana chain present different scalings within the same bulk universality class . with respect to our results on the creutz ladder  @xcite , we conclude that such deviations are due to the localization dynamics of edge states .",
    "we note , in particular , that majorana edge states produce a peculiar scaling of excitations due to their interesting delocalization dynamics . at the quantum critical point ,",
    "majorana edge states fuse with the bulk excitations , and thus become delocalized over the system .",
    "this should be contrasted with the phenomenology evidenced for the creutz ladder , where edge states stay localized for any value of the control parameter .",
    "such a difference , in turn , traces back to the physical content of such states : for the creutz ladder , standard fermions are pinned to the ladder edges due to interference effects caused by additional magnetic fields ; for the majorana chain , they are induced by the u(1 ) symmetry breaking term provided by a superconducting gap . despite of this quantitative difference in the microscopic origin",
    ", we note that both systems belong to the class of topological band insulators  @xcite . therefore , we may conclude that quench dynamics of boundary states in topological insulators should provide additional anomalies in the defect production rate .",
