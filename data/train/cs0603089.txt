    "let @xmath0 be a full - dimensional convex subset of @xmath1 containing a ball of finite radius centered at @xmath2 and contained in a ball of finite radius @xmath3 .",
    "the _ separation problem _ for @xmath0 is that of finding a hyperplane that separates a given point @xmath4 from @xmath0 , or concluding that @xmath5 .",
    "the separation problem is quite general in that it has been shown to be polynomial - time equivalent to other natural convex programming problems @xcite .",
    "one of these problems is the _ optimization problem _ , which is the problem of maximizing a linear functional @xmath6 over all @xmath7 for a given @xmath8 .",
    "it may arise in some applications that solving the optimization problem for @xmath0 is more practically feasible than solving the separation problem directly , for example , if the extreme points of @xmath0 are parameterized by a number of parameters that is significantly smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "in such a case , it might make sense to solve an instance of the separation problem by solving polynomially many instances of the optimization problem , using a turing reduction @xcite from separation to optimization . despite this practical philosophy , which the authors have adopted with some success to the ( np - hard @xcite ) quantum separability problem @xcite ,",
    "the main purpose of research into polynomial - time reductions among convex body problems is theoretical  to uncover the intrinsic beauty of the subject of convex programming algorithms , which historically marries physical intuition and mathematical rigor in a unique way .",
    "our heuristics - based reduction is a fine example of this marriage .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the union of all balls of radius @xmath11 with centers belonging to @xmath0 , and let @xmath12 denote the union of all centers of all balls of radius @xmath11 contained in @xmath0 , where the balls are defined with respect to the euclidean norm .",
    "we now give the formal definitions of the basic convex body problems that will concern us , taken from @xcite .",

    "[ def_wviol ] given a rational vector @xmath8 and rationals @xmath28 and @xmath29 , either    * assert that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 , or * find a vector @xmath32 with @xmath33 .    if @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the origin @xmath36 , then wviol(@xmath27 ) reduces to the _ weak feasibility problem for _ @xmath27 , denoted wfeas(@xmath27 ) . by taking @xmath11 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 to be zero ,",
    "we implicitly define the corresponding _ strong _ problems , denoted ssep , sopt , sviol , and sfeas .",
    "note that sfeas(@xmath27 ) is the problem of deciding whether @xmath27 is empty or finding a point in @xmath27 .",
    "central to our reduction are cutting - plane algorithms for wfeas(@xmath27 ) , relative to a wsep(@xmath27 ) oracle @xmath39 .",
    "all such algorithms have the same basic structure :    1 .",
    "define a ( possibly very large ) regular bounded convex set @xmath40 which is guaranteed to contain @xmath27 , such that , for some reasonable definition of `` center '' , the center @xmath41 of @xmath40 is easily computed .",
    "the set @xmath40 is called an _ outer approximation _ to @xmath27 .",
    "common choices for @xmath40 are the origin - centered hyperbox , @xmath42 and the origin - centered hyperball , @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is a trivially large bound ) .",
    "2 .   give the center @xmath45 of the current outer approximation @xmath46 to @xmath39 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath39 asserts `` @xmath47 '' , then halt . 4 .   otherwise ,",
    "say @xmath39 returns the hyperplane @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",
    "update ( shrink ) the outer approximation @xmath50 for some @xmath51 .",
    "possibly perform other computations to further update @xmath46 .",
    "check stopping conditions ; if they are met , then halt .",
    "otherwise , go to step ( ii ) .",
    "the difficulty with such algorithms is knowing when to halt in step ( iv ) .",
    "generally , the stopping conditions are related to the size of the current outer approximation . because it is always an approximate ( weak ) feasibility problem that is solved , the associated accuracy parameter @xmath38 can be exploited to get a `` lower bound '' @xmath52 on the `` size '' of @xmath27 , with the understanding that if @xmath27 is smaller than this bound , then the algorithm can correctly assert that @xmath53 is empty .",
    "thus the algorithm stops in step ( iv ) when the current outer approximation is smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "the cutting - plane algorithm is called _ ( oracle- ) polynomial - time _ if it runs in time @xmath54 with unit cost for the oracle , where @xmath55 is the outer radius of @xmath27 .",
    "it is called _ ( oracle- ) fully polynomial _ if it runs in time @xmath56 .",
    "there are a number of such polynomial - time convex feasibility algorithms ( see @xcite for a discussion of all of them ) .",
    "the three most important are the _ ellipsoid method _ , the _ volumetric center method _ , and the _ analytic center method_. the ellipsoid method has @xmath57 and is the only one which requires `` further update '' of the outer approximation @xmath46 in step ( iv ) after a cut has been made  a new minimal - volume ellipse is drawn around @xmath58 .",
    "the ellipsoid method , unfortunately , suffers badly from gigantic precision requirements , making it practically unusable .",
    "the volumetric center and analytic center algorithms are more efficient than the ellipsoid algorithm and are very similar to each other in complexity and precision requirements , with the analytic center algorithm having some supposed practical advantages .",
    "the cutting plane @xmath59 requires further definition : @xmath60 intuitively , deep - cut algorithms should be fastest .",
    "ironically , though , except for the case of ellipsoidal algorithms ( which are practically inefficient ) , the algorithms that are provably polynomial - time are central- or even shallow - cut algorithms .",
    "assume without loss that @xmath61 .",
    "our goal is to develop a new oracle - polynomial - time algorithm for wsep(@xmath0 ) with respect to an oracle for wopt(@xmath0 ) ( running in time @xmath62 ) .",
    "we do this via a geometric approach , which differs from the standard approach covered in the next section . in this section",
    ", we ignore the weakness of the separation and optimization problems , as it obfuscates the main ideas ; that is , we assume we are solving ssep(@xmath0 ) with an oracle for sopt(@xmath0 ) .",
    "suppose we have an oracle @xmath63 for the optimization problem over @xmath0 such that , given a nonzero input vector @xmath35 , @xmath63 outputs a point @xmath64 that maximizes @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "an important step in developing the algorithm is noting that , given @xmath63 , the search for a separating hyperplane reduces to the search for a region on the @xmath65-dimensional surface of the unit hypersphere @xmath66 ( embedded in @xmath1 ) centered at the origin .",
    "for @xmath67 , this region @xmath68 is simply @xmath69 ( see figure [ k_p ] ) .",
    "the first observation is that , since @xmath0 properly contains the origin , @xmath68 is contained in the hemisphere defined by @xmath70 :    [ fact_initialcut ] for all @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .",
    "but the fact that the 0-vector is properly contained in @xmath0 implies that there exists @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "the second observation , lemma [ lem_donny ] , is based on the following heuristic , which can be pictured in @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "suppose @xmath35 , @xmath78 , is not in @xmath68 ( but is reasonably close to @xmath68 ) and that the oracle returns @xmath79 .",
    "what is a natural way to modify the vector @xmath35 , so that it gets closer to @xmath68 ?",
    "intuition dictates moving @xmath35 _ away from _ @xmath79 and _ towards _",
    "@xmath4 , that is , add a small component of the vector @xmath80 to @xmath35 , in order to generate a new guess @xmath81 , for some @xmath82 , which we could then give to the oracle again ( see figure [ donnylemma ] ) .",
    "incidentally , we have found that the following little program , which embodies this heuristic , actually performs well : , where @xmath0 is the convex hull of @xmath83 ( which is viewed as full - dimensional in @xmath84 ) , where @xmath85 denotes complex - conjugate transpose , and @xmath86 denotes kronecker product .",
    "this corresponds to the quantum separability problem for two qubits @xcite . ]",
    "this program can be regarded as an extremely simple heuristic for the separation problem when given an optimization subroutine ( of course , it may give inconclusive results ; in practice , one should set @xmath87 as large as is practically feasible ) .",
    "interestingly , the above heuristic can be formalized as follows . if @xmath35 is not in @xmath68 but is sufficiently close to @xmath68 , then @xmath35 , @xmath4 , and @xmath79 can be used to define a hemisphere which contains @xmath68 and whose great circle cuts through @xmath35 . more precisely :    [ lem_donny ] suppose @xmath71 , @xmath88 , and let @xmath89 . if @xmath90 then @xmath91 .    note that @xmath92(m^tc)$ ] .",
    "the hypotheses of the lemma immediately imply that @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 .",
    "the lemma gives a method for reducing the search space after each query to @xmath63 by giving a cutting plane @xmath95 that slices off a portion of the search space .",
    "our search problem can easily be reduced to an instance of sfeas(@xmath27 ) , where @xmath27 is @xmath96 \\setminus \\{\\bar{0}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the set @xmath97 , if not empty , can be viewed as a cone - like object , emanating from the origin and cut off by the unit hypersphere ( see figure [ k_p ] ) .",
    "the oracle @xmath63 , along with lemma [ lem_donny ] , essentially gives a separation oracle for @xmath97 , as long as the test vectors @xmath35 given to @xmath63 satisfy @xmath98    how could we ensure that all our test vectors @xmath35 satisfy ( [ hypothesisofdonnylemma ] ) ?",
    "recall fact [ fact_initialcut ] , which says that the set @xmath97 is contained in the halfspace @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 be the origin - centered unit hyperball in @xmath1 and let @xmath101 .",
    "thus , straight away , the search space is reduced to the hemisphere @xmath102 . the first test vector to give to the oracle",
    "@xmath63 is @xmath103 , which clearly has nonnegative dot - product with all points in @xmath97 and hence all @xmath71 . by way of induction , assume that , at some later stage in the algorithm , the current search space has been reduced to @xmath104 by the generation of cutting planes @xmath105 , where the @xmath106 , for @xmath107 , are the normalized @xmath108 from @xmath109 invocations of lemma [ lem_donny ] . let @xmath45 be the `` center '' of @xmath46 , and _ suppose _ that this `` center '' is a positive linear ( conic ) combination of the normal vectors @xmath106 , that is , @xmath110 then , by inductive hypothesis , this implies that @xmath111 for all @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath112 is a suitable vector to give to the oracle @xmath63 and use in lemma [ lem_donny ] .",
    "therefore , it suffices to find a definition of `` center @xmath45 of @xmath46 '' that satisfies ( [ eqn_centerisconiccombinationofnormals ] ) , in order that all our test vectors @xmath35 satisfy ( [ hypothesisofdonnylemma ] ) .",
    "because we require ( [ hypothesisofdonnylemma ] ) , none of the feasibility algorithms mentioned in section [ sec_definitionsandbackground ] can be applied directly .",
    "however , the analytic - center algorithm due to atkinson and vaidya @xcite beautifully lends itself to a modification that allows ( [ hypothesisofdonnylemma ] ) to be satisfied .    reducing the separation problem for @xmath0 to the convex feasibility problem for some @xmath27 ,",
    "while using the optimization oracle for @xmath0 as a separation oracle for @xmath27 , is not a new concept in convex analysis .",
    "but the precise way that lemma [ lem_donny ] generates each new cutting plane , incorporating the correction - heuristic , does not appear in the literature .",
    "this is likely because there is a more general way to carry out such a reduction , covered in the next section , which does not require ( [ eqn_centerisconiccombinationofnormals ] ) .",
    "note that our reduction requires knowledge of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a polynomial - time turing reduction from wsep(@xmath0 ) to wopt(@xmath0 ) is well known  even when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are unknown .",
    "one such ( ellipsoidal ) reduction is given in theorem 4.4.7 in @xcite ; however , it may be more general than is necessary .",
    "if @xmath3 is known , then the standard way to perform the reduction of the previous section may be found in the synthesis of lemma 4.4.2 and theorem 4.2.2 in @xcite ; we outline it in the following paragraph .",
    "the _ polar _ @xmath113 of a full - dimensional convex set @xmath114 that contains the origin is defined as @xmath115    if @xmath116 , then the plane @xmath117 separates @xmath21 from @xmath0 when @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the separation problem for @xmath4 is equivalent to the feasibility problem for @xmath119 , defined as is guaranteed not to be empty when @xmath120 . for , then , there certainly exists some plane @xmath121 separating @xmath4 from @xmath0 .",
    "but since @xmath0 contains the origin , @xmath122 may be taken to be positive .",
    "thus @xmath123 separates @xmath4 from @xmath0 . ] @xmath124 as mentioned in the previous section ( and elaborated on in the next section ) , to solve the feasibility problem for any @xmath27 , it suffices to have a separation routine for @xmath27 .",
    "because we can easily build a separation routine @xmath125 for @xmath119 out of @xmath126 , it suffices to have a separation routine @xmath126 for @xmath113 in order to solve the feasibility problem for @xmath119 . ''",
    "notation by using it for both truly oracular ( black - boxed ) routines and for other ( possibly not completely black - boxed ) routines . ]",
    "building @xmath125 out of @xmath126 is done as follows : + routine @xmath127 : + case : @xmath128 + return @xmath129 + else : @xmath130 + call @xmath131 + case : @xmath131 returns separating vector @xmath132 + return @xmath132 + else : @xmath131 asserts @xmath133 + return `` @xmath134 '' + it remains to show that the optimization routine @xmath63 for @xmath0 gives a separation routine @xmath126 for @xmath113 .",
    "suppose @xmath135 is given to @xmath63 , which returns @xmath136 such that @xmath137 for all @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath138 , then @xmath126 may assert @xmath133 . otherwise , @xmath126 may return @xmath139 , because @xmath140 ( and hence @xmath141 ) separates @xmath135 from @xmath113 : since @xmath142 , it suffices to note that @xmath143 for all @xmath116 by the definition of @xmath113 and the fact that @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ connection ] shows the relationship between the method of section [ sec_searchheuristic ] and the above method , by illustrating that the set @xmath97 ( defined in ( [ def_k_p ] ) ) is just the radial projection of @xmath119 onto @xmath100 .",
    "using `` @xmath144 '' to mean `` @xmath145 turing - reduces to @xmath146 '' , the standard reduction chain is @xmath147 where we indicate that the middle reduction requires knowledge of outer radius @xmath3 .",
    "our reduction , which is substantially less general , may be written @xmath148 where the weak separation problem has been restricted ( queries must satisfy the condition ( [ hypothesisofdonnylemma ] ) of lemma [ lem_donny ] ) and we note that the rightmost link requires , in addition to knowledge of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , a wfeas algorithm whose centers satisfy ( [ eqn_centerisconiccombinationofnormals ] ) ( see section [ sec_analyticcenters ] ) .",
    "the two reductions have similar structure ; the novelty of our reduction lies in the _ way _ the cutting planes are generated , which is based on the heuristic : if the center @xmath45 satisfies ( [ eqn_centerisconiccombinationofnormals ] ) , then cutting near @xmath45 pushes the new center in the direction of the normal of the new cutting plane ; but this direction is essentially @xmath80 ( except with the projection onto @xmath35 removed ) . note that the normal of every new cutting plane depends on the given point @xmath4 , whereas in the standard reduction it does not .",
    "these attributes tempt us to conjecture that our reduction performs `` better '' in practice when @xmath120 ( though not in any significant asymptotic sense ) .",
    "note that , even though @xmath126 , built on @xmath63 , gives deep cuts @xmath140 , it is not known how to utilize the deep cuts to get a polynomial - time algorithm using analytic or volumetric centers .",
    "our cut - generation method in section [ sec_searchheuristic ] is capable only of giving central cuts ; but this does not , _ a priori _ , put it at any disadvantage ( relative to the standard cut - generation method ) with regard to polynomial - time analytic or volumetric center algorithms . in the next section",
    ", we briefly outline how our heuristic indeed yields a polynomial - time algorithm ( justifying the turing reduction in ( [ ourturingreductionchain ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be the current outer approximation @xmath149 , as described in the second - last paragraph of section [ sec_searchheuristic ] . recall that we need a definition of `` center @xmath45 of @xmath46 '' that satisfies ( [ eqn_centerisconiccombinationofnormals ] ) .",
    "define the _ analytic center _",
    "@xmath45 of @xmath46 as the unique minimizer of the real convex function @xmath150 the relation @xmath151 gives @xmath152 which shows that @xmath45 , defined as the analytic center of @xmath46 , indeed satisfies ( [ eqn_centerisconiccombinationofnormals ] ) .",
    "our algorithm is a modification of the one in @xcite : we use a hypersphere for @xmath40 instead of a hyperbox ( i.e. we adapt the analysis to handle a convex quadratic constraint ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details ( which rely on results in @xcite ) , but remind the reader of some of the algorithm s characteristics .",
    "the algorithm stops when the current outer approximation becomes either too small ( volume - wise ) or too thin to contain @xmath97 . for this , a lower bound @xmath153 on the radius of the largest ball contained in @xmath97 is needed . by exploiting the accuracy parameter @xmath11 of the weak separation problem ,",
    "such an @xmath154 exists ( and is derived in @xcite ) .",
    "the actual algorithm is not as straightforward .",
    "for instance , it is a shallow - cut algorithm ( @xmath155 ) so as to keep the analytic center of the old @xmath46 in the new @xmath46 and the new center close to the old center .",
    "as well , cutting planes are occasionally discarded so that @xmath156 does not exceed some prespecified number .",
    "incidentally , it is an open problem whether there exists a polynomial - time , analytic center algorithm for the convex feasibility problem that does not require shallow cutting .",
    "it has been suggested by mitchell @xcite that central cutting can be used in the atkinson - vaidya algorithm , if certain techniques from @xcite are employed to compute the new analytic center .",
    "however , from correspondence with mitchell and ye @xcite , it is unclear whether modifying the atkinson - vaidya algorithm in this way retains the polynomial - time convergence : while it is clear that a new analytic center can be efficiently computed when central cuts are used , it is not clear that all the other delicate machinery in the convergence argument emerges unscathed .",
    "if central cuts may indeed be used , then the worst - case precision requirements of our algorithm are significantly reduced @xcite .",
