    "the first stars are expected to be cosmologically significant from at least two sets of observations of the high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) intergalactic medium ( igm ) : ( 1 ) hydrogen reionization at @xmath3 @xcite , and ( 2 ) the persistent metallicity ( @xmath4 ) seen in ly@xmath5 clouds up to @xmath6 @xcite . in principle , there should be a strong correlation between the integrated stellar output of metals and ionizing radiation ( @xcite , and references therein ) . examining",
    "the connection between these two effects is critical for several problems in cosmology , including the degree to which a _ single population of early stars _ could have influenced both reionization and igm metal pollution , and the accurate calculation of the igm metallicity , @xmath7 , from observations of metal line absorption , which depends on the assumptions made for the ionizing photon background ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these issues are also pertinent to other fields that are constrained by the stellar history of the baryons , such as theories for baryonic dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "current spectroscopic data imply that h  i reionization may occur not far beyond @xmath1 @xcite , and that he  ii reionization occurs at @xmath8 ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , recent data suggest a higher level of ionizing radiation at @xmath9 69 than would occur in a scenario with `` late '' h  i reionization at @xmath10 6 .",
    "these include observations of : the microwave background from the @xmath11 satellite , indicating a high thomson optical depth of @xmath12 @xcite or early reionization at @xmath13 ; the evolution of ly - limit systems and the igm ionizing background @xcite ; and the observed redshift evolution of the fe / mg ratios in qso emission - line regions @xcite .",
    "although these data are by no means conclusive , they indicate that the level of stellar activity at @xmath14 is potentially significant , and that the reionization history of the igm could be relatively complex , with periods of extended or double reionization for h  i and/or he  ii @xcite .",
    "given the current best - fit cosmological parameters and the associated small - scale power available to the reionizing sources @xcite , an unusually high conversion efficiency of baryons to ionizing radiation may be required @xcite .    at present",
    ", it is believed that almost all of the baryons at @xmath2 @xmath15 reside in the igm , with an average enrichment of @xmath16 @xmath17 at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this is detected primarily through c  iv absorption down to the lowest column density systems , corresponding to the `` true igm '' ; there is also some evidence for widespread o  vi enrichment in this igm component @xcite . from this",
    ", one can roughly estimate the fraction of baryons that went into the first stars that made the igm metals , and the associated number of ionizing photons per baryon @xcite . however , there are two potential problems that we face in trying to constrain the effects of high - mass stars consistently through the degree of igm carbon enrichment .",
    "first , the photons relevant for reionization come from the massive stars in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ; stellar masses @xmath19 10 m@xmath20 ) , while carbon is produced dominantly by longer - lived intermediate - mass stars ( imss ; @xmath21 26 m@xmath20 )",
    ". these stellar products may not be mutually constraining if the imf was different in the past .",
    "second , for burst - driven star formation ( not continuous ) , most of the carbon is produced @xmath21 0.5 gyr after the starburst , an order of magnitude in time _",
    "after _ the massive stars type ii sne , which occur on timescales of a few tens of myr and which could drive galactic winds .",
    "it then becomes unclear how the carbon is expelled from individual halos and distributed ubiquitously in the igm by @xmath10 3 - 5 @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present calculations of the stellar ionizing efficiency as a function of stellar metallicity , @xmath22 , and of the generated metals .",
    "we specifically examine the relation between the integrated ionizing radiation and the output in carbon and oxygen as : ( 1 ) these metals appear to be widely detected in the igm , but are primarily the products ( and hence probes ) of different parts of the imf , and ( 2 ) carbon and oxygen are easily observed at typical igm temperatures at @xmath23 24 . the point that carbon is primarily the product of imss",
    "while massive stars dominate the ionizing radiation is not new to this work , and has been demonstrated extensively in the past ( see respectively , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our main goals here are to investigate the implications of these stellar trends for cosmology , particularly for the reionization and metal enrichment of the high-@xmath2 igm .",
    "we focus on stellar nucleosynthetic arguments , from which we can derive the minimum number of ionizing photons that must have been generated in association with the observed levels of igm enrichment at @xmath24 , including cases with the significant metal yield from imss .",
    "the first generations of stars are expected to be metal - free in composition ( pop iii ) , and rely more heavily on the p ",
    "p chain initially than on the more efficient cno cycle for their thermonuclear fuel source .",
    "consequently , they are hotter and emit significantly harder ionizing radiation relative to their finite-@xmath22 counterparts @xcite",
    ". these objects could play an important role in either the single or extended reionization of h  i and he  ii .",
    "the gain in ionizing radiation with metal - free stars depends on the assumed imf .",
    "recent theoretical studies indicate that the primordial stellar imf may have been top - heavy @xcite , leading predominantly to stellar masses @xmath19 100 @xmath25 .",
    "as noted earlier , for a salpeter imf , all of the ionizing radiation and most of the metals , particularly the alpha - elements ( e.g. , oxygen ) , originate from the short - lived massive stars . with decreasing @xmath22 of the stellar population ,",
    "the massive stars generate greater ionizing radiation and lower post - sn metal yield @xcite . however , the opposite trend holds for the imss : a star of lower @xmath22 has greater metal yield @xcite .",
    "such constraints on stellar activity therefore alter with the average @xmath22 of starforming regions and hence with redshift .    as a diagnostic of the relation between",
    "the generated ionizing photons and metals from stars , @xcite introduced the conversion efficiency , @xmath26 , of energy produced in rest mass of metals , @xmath27 , to the energy released in the h - ionizing continuum , defined as follows : @xmath28    @xcite found @xmath26 to have a relatively constant value of 0.002 for @xmath29 ( j.  m. shull 2003 , private communication ) . ] for solar values of @xmath22 , and to be roughly independent of the stellar imf s slope .",
    "this quantity can be used to calculate the number of ionizing photons per baryon in the universe generated in association with the observed igm metallicity , @xmath30 , defined as the ratio of the energy of the lyc photons per baryon to the average energy of a lyc photon @xcite . for solar-@xmath22 stars where @xmath31",
    ", we have :",
    "@xmath32    this implies that , on average , 10 stellar ionizing photons per baryon were generated in association with the synthesis of the observed @xmath33 , a reasonable value for a number of reasons .",
    "given the observed decline in the space density of bright qsos at @xmath9 3 , high - redshift star formation is thought to have played a significant , if not dominant , role in reionization .",
    "furthermore , although @xmath34 need only equal about unity for reionization , the effects of high-@xmath2 recombinations in the igm and individual halos likely boost the required @xmath30 to values close to about 10 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath26 is strongly dependent on @xmath22 and the imf mass range , an effect that has not been studied until recently @xcite .",
    "thus , the above calculation of @xmath26 does not always lead to @xmath30 @xmath21 10 .",
    "pop iii stars , having no metals , are hotter and emit harder radiation . when combined with the trend of lower metal yields with decreasing @xmath22",
    ", we would expect a net decline in @xmath26 with rising @xmath22 .",
    "this has been recently demonstrated for a few specific cases by @xcite .",
    "however , the significant contribution by imss to the overall metal yield , particularly through carbon , has been neglected by past works @xcite , which assumed that massive stars were the dominant sources of the metals . including the ims contribution has a non - negligible impact on the values of @xmath26 as well as on @xmath30 , as we show below .",
    "a concern in relating the ionizing photon and nucleosynthetic output of stellar populations is finding an overlap amongst the input @xmath22 and assumptions in the literature s calculations . at present",
    ", the ionizing photon spectrum for metal - free massive stars appears to be consistent amongst several works to within @xmath21 10% @xcite .",
    "however , the stellar yields are not entirely convergent yet , with variations of up to factors of a few ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider three values of @xmath22 : 0 , 0.001 and 0.02 ( i.e. , solar ) , and two separate mass ranges , 1100 @xmath25 and 1001000 @xmath25 . from here",
    "onwards , we refer to the former mass range as a present - day imf and to the latter as very massive stars ( vmss ) or , equivalently , a top - heavy imf . although such clean distinctions may not exist for the first stars , we do this in order to differentiate the signatures of stars in these two imfs .",
    "the metal yields are taken from @xcite for stellar masses @xmath35 8 m@xmath20 and from @xcite for the 840 m@xmath20 mass range .",
    "note that for @xmath36 massive stars , we use the @xmath37 case from @xcite . since there are no detailed yields to date for @xmath38 imss",
    ", we use those for @xmath36 imss , which are not substantially different ( a. chieffi 2002 , private communication ) . for @xmath38 vmss , only the stars of mass 140260 @xmath25 avoid complete collapse into a black hole @xcite and contribute to the nucleosynthetic output .",
    "we note that the term yield in this paper connotes the total ejected mass in individual elements or in metals , and not the net yield after accounting for the original metal composition of the star .",
    "we do not consider main - sequence mass loss in any of our cases below ; this is unlikely to be important for low-@xmath22 stellar populations ( see @xcite on this point ) .",
    "we assume the stellar imf to have the form , @xmath39 , and the imf slope , @xmath5 , to be the salpeter value of 2.35 , since small slope variations have been shown to make little difference @xcite .",
    "all the cases here are normalized over their respective mass ranges as , @xmath40 .    for the ionizing spectra , we use @xcite and @xcite for a top - heavy imf , @xcite for 1100 m@xmath20 , @xmath38 stars , and @xcite for non - zero @xmath22 cases .",
    "we note that the _ time - integrated _ ionizing photon number from vmss happens to be roughly the same as that from @xmath38 stars in an imf over 1100 @xmath25 , despite the greatly boosted ionizing _ rate _ from vmss , owing to their brief lifetimes .",
    "the stellar emission rate of ionizing photons drops to less than 1% of its initial value after 30 myr for a present - day imf @xcite , but takes only about 3.5 myr for a top - heavy imf @xcite .",
    "the cause is directly related to the lifetimes of the longest - lived ( metal - free ) star that is relevant for reionization in each of the imfs : a 10 @xmath25 star ( @xmath21 2 @xmath41 yr ) versus a 100 @xmath25 star ( @xmath21 3 @xmath42 yr ) .",
    "the net difference in the time - integrated ionizing radiation is a factor of only @xmath21 1.4 @xcite .",
    "lastly , for the conversion from @xmath26 to @xmath43 , we assume that @xmath16 10@xmath44 , with the correspondingly scaled levels of carbon and oxygen with respect to their solar abundances in this work will increase slightly for carbon and decrease by about 30% for oxygen . ]",
    "( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we take @xmath45 to be 21 ev for @xmath46 and @xmath47 stars , 27 ev for @xmath48 stars in a 1100 @xmath25 imf , and 30 ev for @xmath48 stars in a top - heavy imf @xcite .",
    "we first show that carbon and oxygen are mostly the products of imss and massive stars respectively , and that imss are consequently significant contributors to cosmological metal generation .",
    "figure 1 displays the total imf - weighted yields for metals , @xmath49c and @xmath50o as a function of stellar mass for vmss and for three values of @xmath22 for a present - day imf . using the total ejected mass , @xmath51 , in each element or metals as a function of stellar mass @xmath52 , the @xmath53-axis in the figure",
    "is calculated by weighting each @xmath51 with the imf as @xmath54 .",
    "using the yields and ionizing spectra as described in  2 , we calculate @xmath26 and @xmath30 in table 1 for several cases : ( a ) as a function of @xmath22 ,",
    "( b ) as defined with respect to total metal , @xmath49c , and @xmath50o yield , and ( c ) with metal yields included from three mass ranges ( 1100 @xmath25 , 8100 @xmath25 , and 100 - 1000 @xmath25 ) . in the second case , the conversion from @xmath26 to @xmath43 involves two factors that will cause @xmath30 to vary within each column in the table : @xmath26 and @xmath7 , which will both vary at fixed @xmath22 depending on whether we are considering @xmath26 and @xmath30 with respect to total metals , @xmath49c , or @xmath50o .",
    "the last case is intended to evaluate the impact of the metal contribution from various regions of the stellar imf , particularly from imss , on @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "first , @xmath26 can vary significantly with @xmath22 and with the element with respect to which it is defined .",
    "as anticipated for the reasons outlined in  2 , there is a strong gain in @xmath26 and @xmath34 as @xmath22 decreases , with @xmath55 stars in a present - day imf being up to 10 - 20 times more efficient at generating ionizing radiation per unit metal yield than the @xmath56 stars in @xcite .",
    "second , although the values of @xmath26 approximately match those of , e.g. , @xcite , when the yields from imss are excluded , we see that imss are in fact a substantial source of metals , particularly carbon , and should be included in such calculations .",
    "one possible exception might be at very high redshifts , when imss may not have had the time yet to eject their nucleosynthetic products . in this case , the original definition @xcite of @xmath26 which does not include ims metal yields would be valid , and @xmath26 may be stated to increase with decreasing @xmath22 and/or increasing redshift .",
    "third , @xmath57 is the most sensitive to @xmath22 , increasing strongly from solar-@xmath22 to metal - free stars , for a present - day imf .",
    "this directly results from the following three trends : ( 1 ) @xmath50o and ionizing radiation are produced dominantly by the imf s massive stars , ( 2 ) with decreasing @xmath22 , the production of @xmath50o decreases while that of ionizing photons increases , and therefore , ( 3 ) their ratio @xmath58 , in comparison to @xmath59 or @xmath60 , shows the strongest increase with declining @xmath22 for stars in a present - day imf .",
    "fourth , the value of @xmath26 directly impacts the fraction of baryons required to be converted into a first stars population in order to influence reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one possible implication of the first result above is that a factor of 1020 fewer baryons need be part of such a population for them to be relevant for reionization alone ( which requires only @xmath61 10 ) , if such stars are not required to account for @xmath7 . in this case ,",
    "reionization by pop iii stars in a present - day imf occurs late ( since they should generate fewer ionizing photons than indicated by table 1 ) , and such stars would therefore make a negligible contribution to the carbon detected in the high-@xmath2 igm , particularly at @xmath3 . an alternate interpretation of table 1 ,",
    "assuming that the igm is relatively uniformly enriched by volume , is that @xmath55 stars ( 1100 @xmath25 ) created the igm metals and consequently , reionization may occur early .",
    "this is because the values of @xmath30 ( @xmath21 30220 ) generated by these stars in association with the detected @xmath7 well exceeds that required for a late h  i reionization at @xmath1 .",
    "if clusters of such stars are responsible for both the reionization and metal enrichment of the igm , they should be easily detected by future missions such as the jwst @xcite , and the amount of star formation at @xmath14 is potentially significant (  1 ) .",
    "lastly , despite their high ionizing photon _ rate _",
    ", vmss are _ less _ efficient at generating total ionizing radiation _ per unit metal mass _ than are metal - free stars in a present - day imf , owing to the greatly boosted metal yield from a top - heavy imf .",
    "( both of these stellar populations , however , have approximately equal @xmath60 , with the difference being largest when imss are excluded , or equivalently at @xmath62 . ) therefore , vmss are not necessarily preferred as a more efficient source of ionizing radiation at early epochs on nucleosynthetic grounds in association with a given detected level of igm enrichment , and possibly based on reionization requirements as well ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that the transition from a top - heavy to a present - day imf occurs at gas metallicities of about @xmath63 .",
    "if this were true , then we can scale the numbers for vmss in table 1 down by 1.5 orders of magnitude , and derive that vmss may produce only @xmath21 0.35 ionizing photons per baryon for an igm metallicity of @xmath63 before they pollute their environments and cease forming .",
    "we emphasize , however , that vmss may still be important for reionization alone , given the right combination of conditions , owing to their high ionizing rates .",
    "the conversion between @xmath26 and @xmath30 does not account for the relative propagation timescales of metals and photons from starforming regions to the igm , which will impact the evolution of igm abundance ratios between individual elements , e.g. , [ c / o ] .",
    "furthermore , the definition of @xmath26 implicitly assumes the instantaneous creation of the metals .",
    "this is not necessarily true at high redshifts , e.g. , to generate sufficient carbon at @xmath10 36 requires the star formation to have occurred at @xmath9 69 . as we noted earlier , this becomes particularly problematic for the transport of the carbon to the igm through sn - driven winds .",
