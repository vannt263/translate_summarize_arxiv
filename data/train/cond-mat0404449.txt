    "issues related to transport in low - dimensional electronic systems are challenging , the main difficulties being to take into account of disorder or interactions and in some cases of the interplay between them .",
    "as known from mott and towse  [ ] , for strictly one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , any disorder leads to localized states .",
    "such a statement implies that localization and transport properties of 1d anderson insulators may be tackled perturbatively by considering the limit of a weak disorder ( so called gaussian disorder where the density of impurities @xmath9 , their strength @xmath10 while @xmath11 is constant ) .",
    "for such a weak disorder , and in the absence of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions , berezinskii  [ ] has confirmed the statement of mott and showed that the a.c .",
    "conductivity is given by : @xmath12 .",
    "subsequently , his approach has been extended by gogolin , melnikov and rashba ( gmr )  [ ] to the case where an electron - phonon coupling is present .",
    "they have shown that three - dimensional ( 3d ) phonons provide a delocalization mechanism for the electrons at temperatures low enough that the scattering is mainly elastic , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inelastic phonon scattering time and @xmath15 is the elastic scattering time on the static defects .",
    "this delocalization mechanism leads to a _ power - law hopping _ for the d.c .",
    "conductivity , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath16 , where the power comes from the phonon - scattering time .",
    "it should be noted that their arguments are not valid at the lowest temperatures ; in particular , they hold only above @xmath17 , here and below : @xmath18 unless specified .",
    "subsequent studies aimed at exploring the effect of electron - electron interactions in 1d anderson insulators . in this respect , it has been shown  [ ] that , in a luttinger liquid , the gaussian disorder is strongly renormalized by interactions . for repulsive interactions , each impurity becomes effectively strong .",
    "the 1d disordered interacting system is then equivalent  [ ] to an ensemble of weak links where impurities act as wire breakers . as a consequence ,",
    "the power - law hopping laws acquire a non - universal exponent , _",
    "e.g. _ interaction - parameter dependent .",
    "more recently  [ ] , the low - temperature situation where the coupling to phonons is absent and electron - electron interactions dominate has been addressed . the modern notion of dephasing , due to these electron - electron interactions , has been considered as the delocalization mechanism of the electrons .",
    "it leads to a power - law hopping regime , reminiscent of the results of gmr , followed by a drastic suppression of the conductivity  [ ] .",
    "less explored , from microscopic techniques , is the low - temperature regime : @xmath19 , with both electron - electron and electron - phonon couplings . in this case",
    ", it is generally believed that the transport is of the _ variable - range hopping _ ( vrh ) type . in systems with 3d phonons ,",
    "that we shall be concerned with in the rest of this manuscript , semi - phenomenological arguments by mott  [ ] suggest that the vrh laws are characterized by stretched exponentials and read : [ l_vrh ] ( t ) = _ 0(t ) , where @xmath20 . in 1d ,",
    "@xmath21 , where the single - particle density of states @xmath22 and the localization length @xmath23 .",
    "hence , @xmath24 , and the exponential dependence manifests at @xmath25 . in the opposite case , the temperature dependence of the conductivity arises mainly from the pre - factor : @xmath26 , which depends on the electron - phonon coupling , and leads to power - law hopping , see fig .  [ sigma_t ] for a summary of regimes .",
    "the success of mott s arguments came from their wide experimental confirmation for a great variety of disordered systems , _",
    "i.e. _ it has been found experimentally that @xmath27 in isotropic 3d and @xmath28 in isotropic 2d systems , in accordance with the theory .",

    "variable - range hopping ( vrh ) dominates at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 where @xmath15 is the elastic scattering time on the static defects ) .",
    "[ sigma_t],width=226,height=151 ]    in the present study , we focus on the low - temperature transport properties of strongly disordered and interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) quasi-1d electron systems .",
    "the latter consist of a 2d periodic lattice of parallel wires and therefore display markedly anisotropic properties with relations to the 1d world , see refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] for reviews on 1d physics .",
    "we assume that impurities are point - like and act as wire breakers .",
    "interactions are long - ranged and lead to a large parameter : @xmath32 , corresponding to the ratio of the coulomb energy - scale : @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the dielectric constant of the host lattice in which the 2d system is embedded ) , to the kinetic energy scale given by the fermi energy : @xmath35 . in the field of charge - density waves ( cdw )",
    "@xcite , such quasi-1d mott insulators are referred to as @xmath36 cdws .",
