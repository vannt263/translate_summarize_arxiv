    ", title=\"fig:\",width=336]-0.02 mm    similar quark - antiquark annihilations via a virtual @xmath14 to the @xmath15 final states occur for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 mesons .",
    "( charge - conjugate particles and decays are implied . )",
    "let @xmath20 be any of these pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "to lowest order , the decay width is @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the @xmath20 mass , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 mass , @xmath25 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element between the constituent quarks @xmath26 in @xmath20 , and @xmath27 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the decay constant , proportional to the matrix element of the axial current between the one-@xmath20-meson state and the vacuum , and is related to the wave - function overlap of the quark and antiquark .",
    "the decay @xmath28 starts with a spin-0 meson , and ends up with a left - handed neutrino or right - handed antineutrino . by angular momentum conservation , the @xmath29",
    "must then also be left - handed or right - handed , respectively . in the @xmath30 limit",
    ", the decay is forbidden , and can only occur as a result of the finite @xmath24 mass .",
    "this helicity suppression is the origin of the @xmath31 dependence of the decay width .",
    "radiative corrections are needed when the final charged particle is an electron or muon @xcite .",
    "measurements of purely leptonic decay branching fractions and lifetimes allow an experimental determination of the product @xmath32 .",
    "if the ckm element is well known from other measurements , then @xmath5 can be well measured .",
    "if , on the other hand , the ckm element is not well measured , having theoretical input on @xmath5 can allow a determination of the ckm element .",
    "the importance of measuring @xmath33 depends on the particle being considered . in the case of the @xmath34",
    "the measurement of @xmath35 provides an indirect determination of @xmath36 provided that @xmath6 is provided by theory .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is crucial for using measurements of @xmath37-@xmath38 mixing to extract information on the fundamental ckm parameters .",
    "knowledge of @xmath39 is also needed , but it can not be directly measured as the @xmath40 is neutral , so the violation of the su(3 ) relation @xmath41 must be estimated theoretically .",
    "this difficulty does not occur for @xmath42 mesons as both the @xmath13 and @xmath18 are charged , allowing the measurement of su(3 ) breaking and a direct comparison with theory .",
    "for @xmath34 and @xmath18 decays , the existence of a charged higgs boson ( or any other charged object beyond the standard model , sm ) would modify the decay rates ; however , this would not necessarily be true for the @xmath13 @xcite . more generally , the ratio of @xmath43 to @xmath44 decays can serve as one probe of lepton universality @xcite .",
    "as @xmath45 has been quite accurately measured in superallowed @xmath46 decays @xcite , with a value of 0.97425(22 ) @xcite , measurements of @xmath47 yield a value for @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , @xmath49 has been well measured in semileptonic kaon decays , so a value for @xmath50 from @xmath51 can be compared to theoretical calculations .",
    "lattice gauge theory calculations , however , have been claimed to be very accurate in determining @xmath52 , and these have been used to predict @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "our review of current measurements starts with the charm system .",
    "measurements have been made for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "only an upper limit has been determined for @xmath57 .",
    "both cleo - c and bes have made measurements of @xmath13 decay using @xmath58 collisions at the @xmath59 resonant energy where @xmath60 pairs are copiously produced .",
    "they fully reconstruct one of the @xmath42 s , say the @xmath61 . counting the number of these events",
    "provides the normalization for the branching fraction measurement .",
    "they then find a candidate @xmath62 , and then form the missing - mass squared , @xmath63 , taking into account their knowledge of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath64 , and momentum , @xmath65 , that equals zero in @xmath58 collisions .",
    "a peak at zero @xmath66 infers the existence of a missing neutrino and hence the @xmath67 decay of the @xmath13 .",
    "cleo - c does not explicitly identify the muon , so their data consists of a combination of @xmath67 and @xmath56 , @xmath68 events .",
    "this permits them to do two fits ; in one they fit for the individual components , and in the other they fix the ratio of @xmath69 events to be that given by the sm expectation .",
    "thus , the latter measurement should be used for sm comparisons and the other for new physics searches .",
