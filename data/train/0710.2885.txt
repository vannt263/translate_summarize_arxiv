    "the purpose of this paper is the study of the partition properties of a particular oriented graph , called the _ dense local order_. to our knowledge , the dense local order ( denoted @xmath0 in the sequel ) appeared first in a work of woodrow @xcite .",
    "the attempt then was to characterize the countable tournaments which are homogeneous , that is for which any isomorphism between finite subtournaments can be extended to an automorphism of the whole structure .",
    "it was shown that up to isomorphism , there are only two countable homogeneous tournaments which do not embed the tournament @xmath1 shown in figure 1 . those are 1 ) the tournament corresponding to the rationals @xmath2 where @xmath3 iff @xmath4 and 2 ) the dense local order @xmath0 .",

    "call @xmath9 the resulting oriented graph .",
    "the dense local order is then the substructure @xmath0 of @xmath9 whose vertices are those points of @xmath10 with rational argument .",
    "a few years later , lachlan proved in @xcite that any countable homogeneous tournament embedding @xmath1 also embeds every finite tournament .",
    "this completed the classification initiated by woodrow and showed that up to isomorphism there are only three countable homogeneous tournaments : the rationals , the dense local order and the countable random tournament @xmath11 ( up to isomorphism , the unique countable homogeneous tournament into which every countable tournament embeds ) .",
    "note that this is in sharp contrast with the more general case of countable homogeneous oriented graphs as there are continuum many such objects ( this latter result is due to henson @xcite while the classification of countable homogeneous graphs is due to cherlin @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in ramsey type questions with the following flavor : given @xmath12 and a finite tournament @xmath13 , is there a finite tournament @xmath14 such that for every @xmath15-coloring of the arcs of @xmath14 , there is an induced copy @xmath16 of @xmath13 in @xmath14 where all the arcs have the same color ?",
    "for this particular problem , the answer could be negative ( depending on which @xmath13 we started with ) but becomes positive if one is allowed to have at most two colors instead of one single color for the arcs of @xmath16 .",
    "more generally , ramsey - theoretic properties of the rationals and of the random tournament are known in the following sense : given tournaments @xmath17 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we write @xmath18 when @xmath17 is an induced subtournament of @xmath14 and @xmath19 when there is an isomorphism from @xmath17 onto @xmath13 .",
    "we define the set @xmath20 as @xmath21    for @xmath22 positive elements of @xmath23 ( throughout this article , @xmath24 ) and a triple @xmath25 of tournaments , the symbol @xmath26 is an abbreviation for the statement : `` for any @xmath27}$ ] ( by @xmath28 $ ] we mean the set @xmath29 ) , there is @xmath30 such that @xmath31 does not take more than @xmath32 values on @xmath33 .

    "when @xmath34 , this is simply written @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the class of all finite subtournaments of @xmath39 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 respectively . for @xmath40 or @xmath38 and @xmath41 ,",
    "a first problem is to determine the value of the _ ramsey degree of @xmath17 in @xmath42 _ , denoted @xmath43 , defined as the least @xmath44 such that for every @xmath45 and every @xmath12 there exists @xmath46 such that @xmath47    a second problem is to determine the value of the _ big ramsey degree of @xmath17 in @xmath42_. this latter quantity is denoted @xmath48 and is defined as follows : let @xmath49 denote the tournament @xmath39 if @xmath50 , @xmath11 if @xmath51 and @xmath0 if @xmath52 .",
    "then the big ramsey degree of @xmath17 in @xmath42 is the least @xmath53 such that for every @xmath12 , @xmath54    for @xmath50 , the ramsey degrees and the big ramsey degrees are always finite and can be computed effectively .",
    "more precisely , every @xmath55 is such that @xmath56 .",
    "this is an easy consequence of the original ramsey theorem .",
    "by contrast , a much more difficult proof due to devlin in @xcite showed that @xmath57 , the @xmath58st derivative of @xmath59 evaluated at @xmath60 . recall that @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and that in general @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the bernouilli sequence defined ( for example ) by @xmath67    for @xmath51 , ramsey degrees and big ramsey degrees have never been studied explicitly but can be determined thanks to other known ramsey type results .",
    "in particular , thanks to a general partition result of neetil and rdl , it is known that every @xmath68 has a finite ramsey degree and that @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the set of all automorphisms of @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath71 is known to be finite and the work @xcite by laflamme , sauer and vuksanovic on the countable random undirected graph actually shows that its value can be interpreted as the number of representations that @xmath17 admits into a certain well - known finite structure ( that is , there is an algorithm for every @xmath17 determining the value of @xmath71 ) .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether this expression can be simplified so as to give a counterpart to devlin s formula in the context of @xmath37 .    as for the case",
    "@xmath52 , it does not seem to have been studied by anybody so far and the purpose of the present paper is therefore to fill that gap .",
    "we first study the ramsey degrees in @xmath72 .",
    "our result here reads as follows :    [ thm : rdc ] every element @xmath17 of @xmath72 has a ramsey degree in @xmath72 equal to @xmath73    we then turn to the study of the big ramsey degrees in @xmath72 , and prove :    [ thm : bigrdc ] every element @xmath17 of @xmath72 has a big ramsey degree in @xmath72 equal to @xmath74    as a direct corollary , for every natural @xmath75 and every coloring @xmath76}$ ] , there is an isomorphic copy of @xmath0 inside @xmath0 on which @xmath31 takes only @xmath77 colors ( this statement is not as obvious as it looks ) , and @xmath77 is the best possible bound . on the other hand , for every @xmath15-coloring of the arcs of @xmath0 , there is an isomorphic copy of @xmath0 inside @xmath0 where only @xmath78 colors appear , and @xmath78 is the best possible bound .",
    "theorem [ thm : rdc ] and theorem [ thm : bigrdc ] are proved thanks to a connection between the class @xmath72 and some other classes of finite structures for which several ramsey properties are already known .",
    "those are the classes @xmath79 of all finite structures of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a linear ordering on @xmath82 and @xmath83 is a partition of @xmath82 into disjoint sets . given two such structures @xmath84 and @xmath85 ,",
    "an isomorphism is an order - preserving bijection @xmath86 from @xmath82 to @xmath87 such that for every @xmath88 , @xmath89 iff @xmath90 . as it was the case for the class @xmath72",
    ", there is a unique countable homogeneous structure whose class of finite substructures is @xmath79 . in this paper , this structure is denoted @xmath91 .",
    "the role that @xmath91 plays with respect to @xmath79 is exactly the same as the role that @xmath0 plays for the class @xmath72 . as for @xmath0",
    ", the structure @xmath91 can be represented quite simply .",
    "namely , the structure @xmath91 can be seen as @xmath92 where @xmath39 denotes the rationals , @xmath93 denotes the usual ordering on @xmath39 , and every @xmath94 is a dense subset of @xmath39 .",
    "the notions of ramsey degrees and big ramsey degrees in @xmath79 are then defined in exactly the same way as they are for @xmath72 .",
    "the ramsey degrees in @xmath79 are known : every element in @xmath79 has a ramsey degree in @xmath79 equal to one .",
    "this result , in the case @xmath95 , is one of the key facts in our proof of theorem [ thm : rdc ] . as for the big ramsey degrees , we are able to prove that :    [ thm : bigrdp ] let @xmath96 be a positive natural",
    ". then every element @xmath17 of @xmath79 has a big ramsey degree in @xmath79 equal to @xmath97 .",
    "equivalently , for every element @xmath17 of @xmath79 , @xmath97 is the least possible natural such that for every natural @xmath75 , @xmath98    again , the corresponding result for @xmath95 turns out to be crucial for our purposes . here",
    ", it is one of the ingredients of our proof of theorem [ thm : bigrdc ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : bigrdp ] is obtained by following ideas borrowed from devlin @xcite together with a strengthening of a theorem of milliken @xcite : consider a finitely branching tree ( in the order - theoretic sense ) @xmath99 of infinite height , a number @xmath100 , and a subset @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath102 satisfies certain properties listed in section [ section : milliken ] , we say that @xmath102 is a _",
    "strong subtree of @xmath99 of height @xmath100_. according to milliken s theorem , if we assign a color to each strong subtree of height @xmath100 out of a finite family of colors then there exists a strong subtree of infinite height such that all strong subtrees of height @xmath100 contained in it have the same color . in the version we need in order to prove theorem [ thm : bigrdp ] , each level of the tree is assigned a color ( out of a finite set not related to the set of colors of subtrees ) .",
    "we then consider only strong subtrees of height @xmath100 with some given level - coloring structure and we look for a strong subtree of infinite height with a level - coloring structure similar to that of the original tree .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section : extensions ] , we define the notion of extension in @xmath103 for any element of @xmath72 and show that the number of nonisomorphic extensions in @xmath103 of a given element of @xmath72 can be expressed simply in terms of the size of its automorphism group .",
    "in section [ section : rdc ] , we use this result to compute ramsey degrees in @xmath72 and to prove theorem [ thm : rdc ] . in section [ section : bigrdc ] we turn to the study of big ramsey degrees and show how theorem [ thm : bigrdc ] follows from theorem [ thm : bigrdp ] .",
    "the two remaining sections of the paper are devoted to a proof of theorem [ thm : bigrdp ] .",
    "the first step is carried out in section [ section : milliken ] where we prove a strengthening of milliken s theorem on trees .",
