    "characterization of the variable optical sky is one of the new observational frontiers in astrophysics , with vast regions of parameter space remaining unexplored . at the faint flux levels reached by this optical transient search , previous surveys were only able to probe down to timescales of hours .",
    "an increase in observational sensitivity at short timescale and low peak flux holds the promise of detection and characterization of rare , violent events , as well as new astrophysics .",
    "the detection of transient optical emission provides a window into a range of known astrophysical events , from stellar variability and explosions to the mergers of compact stellar remnants .",
    "known types of catastrophic stellar explosions , such as supernovae and gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) , produce prompt optical transients decaying with timescales of hours to months .",
    "some classes of grbs result from the explosion of massive stars ",
    "these hypernovae are known to produce bright optical flashes decaying with hour  long timescales due to emission from a reverse shock plowing into ejecta from the explosion .",
    "in addition , grbs produce optical afterglows , decaying on day to week timescales , resulting from jet  like relativistic shocks expanding into a circumstellar medium .",
    "even more interesting are explosive events yet to be discovered , such as mergers among neutron stars and black holes .",
    "these may have little or no high - energy emission , and hence may be discoverable only at longer wavelengths @xcite . finally , there is the opportunity to find rare examples of variability , as well as the potential for discovering new , unanticipated phenomena .",
    "one of the primary science goals of this transient search is the rate and distribution of short timescale astronomical variability .",
    "however , we catalogue and report all classes of photometric or astrometric variability with equal consideration .",
    "a weakness in many surveys with targeted science is that serendipitous information is discarded as background ",
    "a counterexample is the wealth of stellar variability information being gleaned from microlensing survey data .",
    "the dls survey geometry and observation cadence are not optimal for maximizing the overall number of detected transients ( e.g. ) , being driven instead by weak lensing science requirements .",
    "however , given the current lack of constraints at short timescales and to significant depth , the potential remains for the discovery of new types of astronomical variability .",
    "the search for variability without population bias is one of the primary goals of the large - aperture synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , ) .",
    "efforts such as the dls transient search are a useful and necessary testing ground for the software design and implementation needed to reduce , in real  time , lsst s expected data flow of 20 tb nightly .",
    "the field of optical variability surveys has been revolutionized by the adaption of ccd devices to astronomy , and by moore s progression of computing power .",
    "the former has yielded wide field imaging systems on large aperture telescopes , and the latter ensures their data can be reduced in quick order , if not real  time .",
    "such advances have lead to modern variability surveys characterized by successively more extreme combinations of depth , cadence , and sky coverage .",
    "the advent of microlensing surveys advanced by orders of magnitude the known number of variable objects , driving the forefront of wide  field ( 0.11 deg@xmath8 ) imaging on meter  class telescopes ( e.g. eros : ; macho : ; mega : ; moa : ; ogle i , ii , iii : ; point - agape : ; supermacho : ) .",
    "the cadences are typically of order 1 image per day per field , although various strategies have been employed for sensitivity to short events or fine structure in longer events .",
    "such surveys are traditionally directed at crowded systems of stars serving to backlight a foreground microlensing population .",
    "this stellar background , however , also serves as a foreground that obfuscates sources at cosmological distances .",
    "surveys for supernovae at cosmological distances avoid such crowded foregrounds , employing similar resources and attaining similar sky coverage , but reaching deeper than the microlensing searches ( e.g. high - z : ; scp : ) .",
    "the original surveys cadence of field reacquisition was typically of order a month , short enough to avoid confusion by active galactic nuclei but long enough to ensure a handful of new supernova per observing run .",
    "these surveys were designed only for event discovery , with subsequent lightcurve coverage provided by narrower field followup resources . given the successes of the original supernovae surveys , subsequent efforts have been allocated resources for an advanced observing cadence allowing both detection and self  followup , such as the ifa deep @xcite and essence @xcite supernova surveys",
    ". the nearby supernova factory is expecting @xmath9 type ia supernova per year from their moderate aperture ( 1.2meter ) telescope and large ( 9 deg@xmath8 ) field of view @xcite .",
    "however , dedicated systems with a small field of view ( 0.01 deg@xmath8 ) , similar depth , and a cadence of several days can lead to a wealth of supernova detections ( e.g. loss : ) .",
    "asteroid and near earth object ( neo ) searches cover of order thousands of degrees per night , primarily in the ecliptic , and near opposition ( e.g. loneos : ; linear : ; neat : ) .",
    "their photometric depths are shallower than supernova surveys and the cadence more rapid , given the requirement of recovering objects in motion .",
    "the images are typically of poorer seeing and image sampling , given less stringent photometric requirements .",
    "truly wide  field systems ( 10 to 100 deg@xmath8 ) incorporating small apertures and limiting survey depths of 1217@xmath0 magnitudes are able to cover the entirety of the sky in a given night , or a given large region of sky multiple instances per night ( e.g. grosce : ; rotse - iii : ; raptor : ; asas-3 : ) .",
    "such systems are optimized for the detection and followup of fast optical transients , such as optical counterparts to grbs .",
    "these systems compromise nyquist sampling of the point spread function ( psf ) and photometric depth for breadth and real  time agility .",
    "raptor s advanced implementation includes a narrow  field fovea to optimally study localized transients . the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs : )",
    "makes use of rotse - i survey data , which sampled the entire local sky up to twice nightly and provides variability information on @xmath10 million objects between 815.5@xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "additional variability surveys include the quest rr lyrae survey @xcite , which is to cover 700 deg@xmath8 to @xmath11 magnitude in the galactic equator , with sensitivity to several timescales of variability .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey has a sequence of multi  color temporal information for over 700 deg@xmath8 at multiple timescales @xcite .",
    "the palomar - quest synoptic sky survey drift  scans 500 deg@xmath8 per night , with scans separated by time baselines of days to months @xcite .",
    "the deep ecliptic survey monitors 13 deg@xmath8 per night near the ecliptic in a search for kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , using 4meter telescopes and 2 exposures separated by 23 hours and a third within a day @xcite . finally , the faint sky variability survey ( fsvs : ) is a study of overall optical and astrometric variability at faint magnitudes on a 2.5meter telescope .",
    "point source limiting magnitudes reach to 25 over a field of @xmath12 deg@xmath8 , and the cadence of field reacquisitions is staggered for sensitivity at several timescales , and thus to multiple phenomena . of all on  going variability surveys , the fsvs is most similar to the dls transient search .",
    "the deep lens survey ( dls ) is a 5year noao survey operating on the 4meter blanco and mayall telescopes + mosaic imagers at the cerro tololo and kitt peak observatories , respectively @xcite .",
    "the survey is undertaking very deep multicolor imaging of five @xmath13 fields chosen at high galactic latitude , and composed of 9 subfields apiece .",
    "exposure times and filters are chosen to reach limiting magnitudes of @xmath14 to @xmath15 mag per square arcsecond surface brightness , with images typically acquired near new moon . at these limiting magnitudes ,",
    "we expect to measure accurately the shapes and color  redshifts of @xmath16 galaxies per square degree for weak lensing science .",
    "an overview of the survey and public data releases are available at http://dls.bell - labs.com/. the survey is expected to conclude observations in march , 2005 .",
    "full exposure depth requires 20 exposures per passband in each of our 45 subfields .",
    "the images are obtained , with some exceptions , in sets of 5pointing dither sequences , with offsets of @xmath17 and @xmath18 around the initial central pointing to fill gaps between mosaic chips and enable super  sky  flat construction .",
    "typical exposure times are 600 seconds in @xmath1 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , and 900 seconds in @xmath5 , yielding limiting magnitudes per exposure for point sources of approximately @xmath21 . the weak lensing science goals of the survey require co  adding these images . in the co  addition process , however ,",
    "variable sources are clipped out , or averaged away . here",
    "we pursue an orthogonal approach , which instead analyzes _ differences _ in these data , at the pixel level , to extract this variability .",
    "this paper summarizes our transient search to date .",
    "starting in december 1999 , we began analysis of our acquired images in near  real time , which we define as within the duration of a dither sequence of observations .",
    "true real  time reductions ideally occur within the timescale it takes to acquire the subsequent observation , or , given a target population of events , shorter than the timescale of the variability being searched for . recognizing variability in near  real time with current ccd mosaics requires data analysis of several gb nightly of images on  site . to this end , we maintain computers in the control rooms of both the kitt peak and cerro ",

    "figure  [ fig - samp ] displays the distribution ( _ dotted _ line ) of temporal intervals between subfield reacquisitions , integrated over all subfields .",
    "the _ solid _ line shows this same quantity , but only for reacquisitions in the same filter as the previous observation .",
    "since variability is detected through comparison of observations taken in similar filters , the integral under this _ solid _ subfield  filter histogram up to timescale @xmath22 defines our overall sensitivity to transients at timescale @xmath22 .",

    "figure  [ fig - samp ] indicates our primary sensitivity is to variability on thousand  second timescales . in this subset",
    "we have a total integrated exposure time of 10.2 days distributed over 425 @xmath1band , 464 @xmath19band , and 393 @xmath5band images . at @xmath23 per image",
    ", this yields a total exposure @xmath24 of @xmath25 deg@xmath8days for sensitivity to @xmath26 second events down to 24@xmath0 magnitude .",
    "we have a factor of 17 smaller @xmath24 for inter ",
    "night observation intervals at @xmath27 seconds , and also at inter ",
    "month observation intervals at @xmath28 seconds .",
    "a planned re  analysis of all survey data for transients will allow for a precise determination of @xmath24 at all available timescales .      our typical subfield observation comes as a 5image dither pattern controlled using the iraf script mosdither .",
    "standardized information is written in each of the images fits headers , and is used in the pipeline to automatically associate each quintuple of images .",
    "basic image calibration is done before each image is sent to the transient pipeline .",
    "the iraf task mscred.ccdproc is used to correct for cross ",
    "talk , apply overscan correction and trim the image , and bias and flat  field correct the images ( we generally take calibration sequences in the afternoon to allow for real  time reductions ) . in the case of @xmath20band data ,",
    "we need to apply a fringing correction , requiring an accumulation of images that generally precludes real  time reductions .",
    "finally , the images are registered to the world coordinate system ( wcs ) on the sky using mscred.msccmatch with the noao : usno - a2 @xcite catalog .",
    "the images are then copied to a directory that is continuously searched by the transient pipeline image reaper .",
    "our transient pipeline uses the opus environment @xcite as a backbone sequencing a series of python and perl language scripts , each defining a `` stage '' in our pipeline .",
    "these stages are defined as follows :    * in : copy an image via the scp protocol from the iraf reduction machine to the transient pipeline machine . *",
    "ri : register and pixel  wise resample an incoming image to a fiducial template image of the subfield .",
    "wcs information is used as a starting point for determining the registration coefficients .",
    "the astrometric template is the same for all passbands , and is constructed from the very first observation of a subfield .",
    "* ci : detect and catalog objects in the registered image using sextractor @xcite . for our detection thresholds",
    ", we use sextractor parameters detect_thresh = analysis_thresh = 2.5 . * hi : difference each dither against the first pointing , using a modified version of the @xcite algorithm .",
    "modifications include internal methods to register and remap pixels based upon wcs information , comprehensive discrimination of appropriate regions to determine the image convolution kernel , figures of merit to determine the direction of convolution , robust methods to ensure complete spatial constraint on the variation of the kernel , and the propagation of noise through the convolution process * fi : catalog the difference image and filter object detections , including the calculation of adaptive second moments @xcite .",
    "these moments , originally designed for accurate shape measurements in our weak lensing pipeline , are used here to verify the integrity of each candidate .",
    "cuts on the results of this analysis ( e.g size criteria for cosmic ray rejection ) help to reject a significant fraction of the noise and false positives , as well as a fraction of the actual transients present .",
    "this stage yields the short  timescale transients in each dither sequence , primarily solar system objects , but also including stellar and unknown sources of variability .",
    "+ to algorithmically cull false detections from our object lists , we first construct exclusion zones around bright stars , using the noao : usno - a2 @xcite catalog , and along bad ccd columns , using bad pixel masks supplied with the mscred package . given a list of candidates sextracted from the difference image",
    ", we further analyze each object in both the original input image and the difference image . in the input image",
    ", we require the object s semi  minor axis , as computed from adaptive second moments , to be greater than 1 pixel ( @xmath29 ) as a cut against cosmic rays . in the difference image",
    ", we further require second moments greater than 0.9 pixels , uncertainties in the orthogonal ellipticity components less than 0.5 pixels , and integrated flux measurements greater than 0 counts .",
    "we also examine all pixels within 20 pixels of a candidate , and require @xmath30 of all pixels to be neither negative nor masked , and @xmath31 of non  masked pixels to be positive valued .",
    "these additional cuts safeguard against bad registrations or subtractions , which tend to leave a number of contiguous pixels above the detection threshold , but also regions of systematic dipole residuals .",
    "this does impact our efficiencies for slowly moving objects such as kbos . by correctly propagating noise arrays through the remapping and difference imaging process",
    ", it is possible to compare projected noise properties of the image to empirical measurements , and automatically identify and reject such regions .    at this point ,",
    "the individual images are co  added to make a deeper representation of the subfield and searched for longer timescale transients :    * si : co  add the dither sequence of images into a single deep image of the subfield , providing complete spatial coverage by filling in mosaic chip gaps . *",
    "it : identify prior templates of the same subfield , in the same filter , to use as templates for detecting variability on longer timescales .",
    "* hs : difference the deep image stack constructed in stage si against the prior templates .",

    "longer timescale transients are revealed at this stage , primarily supernova and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and stellar variability .",
    "we employ similar object cuts as in stage fi . *",
    "cl : clean up and archive data files , and inform the observers that the sequence of observations is ready to be reviewed .",
    "our automated cuts typically reduce the number of candidates per image from several hundreds to several tens . after the last stage of the pipeline",
    ", the observer must manually categorize the remaining candidates . a graphical user interface displays the sequence of difference images .",
    "each is presented as a triplet of postage stamps centered on the candidate and showing the prior template , current image , and difference between them .",
    "the nature of the transient is determined using a variety of factors , which can be divided into temporal and contextual information .",
    "temporal discriminants include astrometric motion of the transient , indicative of solar system origin , as well as the timescale of photometric variability for stationary objects , which can help discriminate between populations of variability with known timescales , or to single out an object varying with unexpected rapidity .",
    "contextual discriminants include the existence of a precursor or host object , and the proximity and relative location of the transient event .    during visual classification of a transient , a set of data files",
    "are automatically generated locally on disk , after cross ",
    "checking for spatial coincidence with previous transients , or proximity to approximate ephemerides for moving objects .",
    "an ephemeris is generated for moving objects , and for stationary objects , a finding chart .",
    "these files are copied to our remote web server where a periodic daemon executes a command to regenerate our web page based upon the data files present .",
    "thus , every 15 minutes our web page is brought into sync with the transients detected at the telescope . at the conclusion of each run ,",
    "all moving objects are reported to the minor planet center and the most convincing supernova candidates to the central bureau for astronomical telegrams .",
    "the magnitudes resulting from photometry on difference images are denoted by the symbol @xmath32 .",
    "this represents the magnitude of a static object whose brightness is equal to the measured change in flux @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the photometric zero  point of the template image .",
    "this quantity can be related to the change in magnitude @xmath36 of an object with quiescent magnitude @xmath37 through the relation @xmath38 in the limit where the variability comes from a precursor fainter than the detection limit , such as for supernovae , then @xmath32 represents the magnitude of the transient itself . in the following , we report all magnitudes derived from difference imaging in units of @xmath32 .    we are further pursuing algorithms that might automatically and optimally discriminate between transient classes , which will be a necessity for larger scale transient searches",
    "one such example is the genetic imagery exploration software package ( genie : ) .",
    "genie uses genetic algorithms to assemble a sequence of image operators that optimally extract features from multi ",
    "spectral data , and might be naturally be applied instead to our multi  temporal sequences .",
    "all archived transients are made available on the internet at http://dls.bell-labs.com/transients.html , generally within a few hours of observations .",
    "transients are broadly categorized as `` moving '' ( slow or fast objects are highlighted ) , `` variable star '' , `` supernova '' , `` agn or supernova '' ( if this can not be distinguished based on the host morphology and transient location ) , or `` unknown '' , a broad category indicating objects whose astrophysical nature is uncertain .",
    "this includes very rapidly varying objects , or transients with no obvious precursor or host .",
    "roughly 75% of the transients detected in the dls are astrometrically variable solar system objects .",
    "four of the five dls fields are within 15@xmath39 of the ecliptic , and in these fields we generally find of order ten moving objects per subfield visit .",
    "the total number of moving objects detected through spring 2003 is 3651 , with 900 detected in @xmath1 , 1508 detected in @xmath19 , and 1487 detected in @xmath5 ( some were detected in multiple filters ) . our detection efficiency for moving",
    "objects has not been modeled .",
    "because of our observing pattern , most of the moving objects are observed on a single night and never recovered . a main belt asteroid moving at @xmath4030@xmath41  hr@xmath42 near opposition leaves a subfield within a few days .",
    "as a result , only about one - third of our moving objects have been observed on multiple nights , and 333 of these have received minor planet center provisional designations , which are listed on our website .",
    "similarly , we are able to measure colors for only a fairly small fraction of these objects . therefore , we do not attempt a thorough analysis of orbital parameters , albedos , and sizes .",
    "rather , we give an overview of the dataset and then detail a few especially interesting objects .",
    "figure  [ fig - astmag ] shows the magnitude distribution of all moving objects discovered , separately for @xmath1 , @xmath19 , and @xmath5 .",
    "note that the magnitude range is displaced from the magnitude range in which our efficiency for stationary point sources is nonzero ( figure  [ fig - eff ] ) .",
    "this is because the vast majority of moving objects are significantly trailed during our 600 or 900 second exposures .",
    "an asteroid at the bright end can therefore be much brighter than a point source before saturation sets in , and at the faint end must also be brighter to rise above the detection threshold .",
    "figure  [ fig - veldist1 ] shows the moving objects velocity distribution in ecliptic coordinates , highlighting a pair of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) detailed below .",

    "our observations provide orbital arcs of 5 and 4 days for these kbos , respectively .",
    "the detection efficiency for fast movers declines with velocity , as their reflected light is trailed over larger area .",

    "however , these stars are not known to flare .",
    "the situation is similar for ot 20030305 , which is far too faint at @xmath111 mag to belong to the disk population .",
    "assuming an @xmath108 derived spectral type of approximately dm6 , its distance modulus yields @xmath112 kpc .",

    "in addition , selection effects in most previous studies have biased discovery towards stars of greatest flare visibility .    until recently ,",
    "one of the only ways to estimate the expected rate of flare star activity was to extrapolate equation  5 from @xcite .",
    "this relation was derived using data for a selected few of the most active flare stars in the immediate solar neighborhood .",
    "scaling kunkel s relation to our @xmath1 passband , and assuming that @xmath51 of all dm46 stars exhibit strong flaring activity ( i.e. @xmath114 of 1 mag or greater ) , we may place an upper limit of approximately 0.08 flare events expected per subfield in each 600 sec exposure .",
    "given the extreme selection bias in kunkel s sample , it is not unexpected to discover that this estimate ( @xmath115 ) is much different than what we find ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "we also examine the stellar flare survey data of @xcite . utilizing astrographic plates covering @xmath117 deg@xmath8 at low galactic latitude to apparent @xmath1 magnitude of 1014",

    "having analyzed 425 accumulated @xmath1band images for this publication , we expect an upper limit of 6.4 flaring events @xmath119 magnitudes .",
    "the distribution function of the amplitudes of flaring events in these stars is not well known , but in general the brighter flares make up a smaller fraction of the total number of events @xcite .",
    "thus the discovery of only one certain flare event of @xmath121 mag is consistent with this upper limit . given the lack of unbiased flare star samples down to our limiting magnitudes , a direct comparison with other surveys requires the analysis of more modern variability datasets ( e.g fsvs : ) .",
    "@xcite have reported a highly luminous ot event from the sloan digital sky survey , with an underlying host galaxy at @xmath122 .",

    "null detections are also reported for ot 20030305 in the first , nvss , and pmn equatorial catalogs , with an explicit limit from first of 0.94 mjy / beam .",
    "overall , these null detections seem to reject radio  loud agn as sources for this variability .",
    "we have also searched the archival x  ray and gamma  ray catalogs through heasarc , and while ot 20010326 returns several matches corresponding to components of abell 1836 , no matches are found within @xmath124 .",
    "a search around ot 20030305 finds no matches within @xmath125 .",
    "this weighs against a variety of accretion scenarios , including agn and other galactic x  ray sources .",
    "there is an expected population of optical transients associated with the observed rate of gamma ray bursts .",
    "however , the connection between the two event rates is very uncertain , given the variety of means to draw optical emission from hydrodynamic evolution of a grb event .",
    "these means include `` orphan '' grbs , where a highly collimated grb points at large enough angle away from the observer that gamma ray emission is avoided but optical afterglow radiation is not @xcite ; and `` dirty '' or `` failed '' fireballs whose ejecta comprise a significant amount of baryons and/or have a small lorentz factor ( @xmath126 100 , e.g. , ) .",
    "distinguishing between these possibilities requires fine constraints on the time decay slope @xmath66 , radio observations , and/or multiwavelength observations at the time of the so  called grb `` jet break '' @xcite .",
    "given the our poor temporal resolution , and lack of simultaneous multi ",
    "wavelength coverage , we are not uniquely sensitive to the micro  physics expected to drive the early evolution of grb lightcurves , and whose resolution might distinguish between the above possibilities . within the resolution and timescale of our observations ,",
    "all grb variants effectively yield the same characteristic isolated fading object .",
    "the thousand second timescale of the observed events is of similar duration to the early lightcurve break observed in grb 021211 @xcite . after this break",
    ", the power law flux decay index @xmath66 was seen to decrease from 1.8 to 0.8  before this time , the transient dimmed by more than 2.5 magnitudes . if our already faint , rapidly declining optical transients represent a similar early phase of gamma  ray dark grb lightcurves , their subsequent evolution would be below our detection limit .",
    "we also note that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the grb afterglow component is modeled as a synchrotron emission spectrum ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the expected spectral shape scales like @xmath127 .",
    "thus it is surprising that our distribution of @xmath1:@xmath19:@xmath5detected transients is 2:1:0 ( where ot 20030305 contributes to both the @xmath1 and @xmath19 event rate ) if these events are drawn from a population of events characterized by a synchrotron sed .",
    "recent submillimeter and radio observations of localized grb host galaxies show they are bluer than selected galaxies at similar redshifts , indicative of star formation or relatively low dust content ( e.g. , ) .",
    "host galaxies for localized x  ray flashes ( xrfs ) also appear to exhibit the same characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , our putative hosts are considerably redder than these samples of grb or xrf  selected host galaxies , and are unlikely to be drawn from the same population .",
    "the @xmath108 colors of our ot hosts are , however , loosely consistent with the observed population of extremely red objects ( eros ) , which comprise old or dusty star  forming galaxies .",
    "if eros represent highly obscured starburst activity at moderate redshift ( @xmath128 ) , they contribute a significant fraction of the overall star formation at that epoch @xcite . assuming our population of ots traces star formation",
    ", we expect some association with eros .",
    "the absence of extremely red grb host galaxies suggests detection of grbs is biased against dusty galaxies .",
    "if our ots arise from dust enshrouded galaxies , this bias would seem lesser for optically detected events .",
    "we map our detection of these objects into a quantitative statement describing the rate of short timescale astrophysical variability .",
    "we derive general constraints without bias towards a particular ot model .      to account for inefficiencies in our pipeline , we model our efficiency @xmath129 at recovering transients throughout a range in brightness .",
    "we calibrate the efficiency via monte carlo runs in which we add point source transients .",
    "we define an efficiency run as the generation of 32 random amplitude point sources , with the integrated flux chosen as a uniform deviate in the exponent of @xmath130 , which are placed within a dither sequence of survey data .",
    "positions are randomly selected within the limits of the primary exposure , and are placed at the same astronomical position within each of the subsequent 4 dithers .",
    "we do not bias our results by assuming a temporal shape for the variability .",
    "instead , we generate an overall efficiency for recovering a given amount of input flux , averaged over the spatial coverage of our dither sequence .    we include in our analysis @xmath1 , @xmath19 , and @xmath5band survey data ( @xmath20band data are infrequently reduced in real  time due to fringing complications ) .",

    "the number of input objects recovered is tallied , searching both the unfiltered and filtered object catalogs generated at the fi stage in our pipeline .",
    "this yields an unfiltered detection efficiency ( _ dotted _ histogram in figure  [ fig - eff ] ) as well as the efficiency of passing our cuts ( _ solid _ histogram in figure  [ fig - eff ] ) . the difference between the two histograms demonstrates the rejection of true positives in our filtering process , yielding an overall decrease in efficiency .",
    "we use the _ solid _ histogram in the subsequent event rate analysis .",
    "we note that approximately @xmath133 of our sky coverage lands in gaps between mosaic chips , and the dithering procedure shifts @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the template images common sky area off of the subsequent dithers .",

    ", we require that a transient be confirmed in a subsequent image , which we consider a human observer @xmath142 efficient at classifying as real . thus our limits on short timescale variability correspond to twice our typical exposure time , plus @xmath79 of readout between images .",
    "our efficiencies in figure  [ fig - eff ] are relatively constant between the bright and faint limits , which we can approximate by a constant efficiency @xmath143 without loss of specificity . however , due to the differing @xmath144 per passband , differences in typical exposure times , and in number of events detected , we also quote event rates for each passband individually .",
