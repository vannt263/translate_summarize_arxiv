    "this topic has gained enormous attention due to recent experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , where coherent evolution can be studied for long times . knowing the maximum speed at which many - body systems can evolve  @xcite is also central for the development of algorithms for quantum optimal control  @xcite .    in experiments with optical lattices",
    ", the evolution of the system initiates after changing instantaneously ( quenching ) a certain initial hamiltonian @xmath1 to a new final hamiltonian @xmath2 . in this context",
    "there is evidence that the relaxation dynamics shows a power law behavior in some disordered systems  @xcite , noninteracting integrable systems  @xcite , and close to critical points  @xcite .",
    "here we study deterministic ( clean ) quantum systems with interaction . for different final hamiltonians ,",
    "we identify features that lead to similar relaxation processes and can therefore contribute to a long aspired universal picture .    in 1984",
    "peres proposed that the notion of irreversibility in the quantum domain could be explained in terms of sensitivity of the quantum states to perturbations added to the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "such sensitivity is quantified via fidelity ( loschmidt echo ) between states evolved under an unperturbed hamiltonian and states evolved by a perturbed hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "several studies confirmed peres s expectations and showed that the fidelity decayed exponentially when the perturbation induced chaos  @xcite .",
    "however , an exponential behavior was observed also in integrable systems when the initial state was sufficiently delocalized in the energy representation  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , rather than a chaotic hamiltonian , the main cause for a fast statistical relaxation must be the chaotic structure of the initial state with respect to the hamiltonian that dictates its evolution .    to establish a relationship between the level of delocalization of the initial state and the characteristics of the relaxation dynamics after a quench",
    ", we employ concepts from many - body quantum chaos .",
    "we associate the unperturbed hamiltonian with @xmath1 and the perturbed hamiltonian with @xmath2 .",

    "the distribution @xmath8 of the components @xmath9 in the eigenvalues @xmath10 is known as local density of states ( ldos )  @xcite . for @xmath11 close to the middle of the spectrum ,",
    "as the perturbation increases from zero , this distribution broadens from a delta function to a lorentzian form and eventually approaches a gaussian of width @xmath12 , identified as the energy shell  @xcite .",
    "contrary to full random matrices , where the states are fully delocalized , in realistic systems with few - body interactions , the energy shell gives the maximum possible spreading of the ldos .",
    "ldos is a key concept in nuclear physics  @xcite , where it is measured experimentally .",
    "it is likely to gain a especial role also in quantum thermodynamics , since it is related with the probability distribution of work  @xcite    in this paper , we investigate ldos , the fidelity decay , and the short - time dynamics of few - body observables in the limit of strong perturbation .",
    "the fidelity corresponds to the fourier transform of the ldos .",
    "it therefore decays exponentially when @xmath8 is lorentzian  @xcite , although at very short - times it behaves as @xmath13 , as expected from perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , consensus has been reached that even when @xmath8 was gaussian , a gaussian decay would occur for a certain time and then necessarily switch to exponential before saturation  @xcite . here",
    ", we show that when the initial state fills the energy shell substantially , the gaussian expression for the fidelity , @xmath14 , _ can persist until saturation _ , independent of the regime ( integrable or chaotic ) of @xmath2 .",
    "this is illustrated numerically for initial states that can be prepared in experiments with cold atoms , but can hold for any @xmath3 where @xmath8 has a gaussian shape  @xcite .",
    "the absence of an exponential decay also has been noticed in recent works  @xcite for models and initial states different from the ones we consider .",
