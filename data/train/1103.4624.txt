    "heavy quark hadrons attract great interests since the observation of the exotic @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one of their prominent features is the proximity to one or several thresholds .",
    "these mesons , followed by the observation of other exotica @xcite , triggered lots of discussions about the bound state problem of heavy quark hadrons .",
    "the case of hidden charm mesons is a major concern because they are relatively easy to produce in the experimental facilities .",
    "there are several types of two - body hidden charm systems : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . for the first three types , the components are heavy and",
    "may be treated nonrelativistically . since the interactions may be mediated by light meson exchanges ,",
    "each type had been proposed to have bound states @xcite . for the last two types ,",
    "the two - body attraction is not so strong and the formation of a molecule may be difficult . however , it is possible that the in - medium effects may drive the formation of bound states because of the van der waals type force .",
    "such quarkonia are called nuclear - bound charmonium @xcite or hadro - charmonium @xcite .",
    "more exotic bound states are possible in the heavy quark case due to the relatively small kinetic term .",
    "the charmed meson - nucleus systems are interesting in that they are easy to tag .",
    "one may find works about @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) interaction and the charmed mesic nuclei in various methods in refs .",
    "the calculations favor the existence of such bound states .",
    "the formation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 hypernuclei was predicted more than 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "there were further studies about such hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath1-nuclei had also been claimed @xcite .",
    "recently , this problem was revisited with the quark - meson coupling model @xcite and it was found that the charmed hypernuclei are still probable . however , it is inconclusive whether the two - body bound states in the @xmath0 channel exist or not @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , various heavy quark deuteronlike bound states , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and so on , were discussed by scaling the strengths of the nucleon - nucleon interaction models .",
    "but the interactions between @xmath1 and @xmath19 could not be approximated by the rescaled @xmath20 interaction .",
    "as @xmath0 is the most fundamental charmed nucleon state , it is worthwhile to give it a serious study with the modern heavy quark effective theory and channel couplings to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    with the forthcoming facilities such as gsi - fair and j - parc @xcite",
    ", it would be possible to draw a conclusion whether the charmed hypernuclei exist or not . to understand further this problem theoretically",
    ", we revisit the two - body bound states in the @xmath21 channel at the hadron level in this paper .",
    "since the one - pion - exchange interaction is forbidden in the @xmath21 channel , we consider scalar and vector meson exchange contributions .",
    "we also include the coupled channel effects due to the nearby @xmath4 and @xmath5 thresholds .",
    "the coupled channel effects in the heavy quark scenario probably have sizable contributions even though the thresholds are not very close to each other , which may be realized from the discussions about the resonance effects for the @xmath22 production @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how important the coupled channel effects are for the formation of the @xmath0 bound states .    in the early studies of the @xmath0 interaction @xcite , the su(4 ) symmetry",
    "was used to extend the one - boson - exchange model for @xmath20 and @xmath23 interactions . at that time , the heavy quark symmetry had not yet been explored . with this symmetry",
    ", one does not need to consider the largely broken su(4 ) any more . as a result of the heavy quark symmetry ,",
    "parts of interacting terms are related and the lagrangian can be written in a compact form . because of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of qcd , it is natural to consider chiral symmetry for pions . to include the light vector mesons",
    ", we turn to the hidden symmetry approach where the vector mesons are treated as gauge fields of a hidden local symmetry .",
    "this approach has been successful in explaining the ksrf relation @xmath24 , the universality of @xmath25 coupling , and @xmath25 dominance of the photon coupling to pions @xcite . here ,",
    "when deriving the one - boson - exchange potentials , we use effective lagrangians satisfying the heavy quark symmetry for heavy baryons , chiral symmetry for pions , and hidden local symmetry for vector mesons .",
    "the lagrangian is analogous to the heavy meson version presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . as for the unknown coupling constants , we turn to the quark model , chiral multiplets , vector meson dominance , and qcd sum rule .",
    "extension of the study to the bottom case is also interesting , but we would not explore it here . our paper is organized as follows . after the introduction , we present the effective lagrangians in sec .",
    "then we determine the coupling constants with various methods in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present the derived potentials . the numerical results for the @xmath26-wave spin - singlet and triplet @xmath0 are given in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we present our discussions and conclusions in sec .",
    "here , we consider the @xmath26-wave @xmath0 states and the channels which couple to them , i.e. , the @xmath27 and @xmath28 or @xmath29 two - baryon states .",
    "we consider the contributions from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels .",
    "it is a 3-channel problem for @xmath28 and 7-channel problem for @xmath30 .",
    "the labels are listed in table [ chn - lab ] .",
    "because of the higher mass , we assume that the @xmath31 contributions are negligible .    .the @xmath26-wave @xmath0 states and the channels which couple to them .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     theoretically , the formation of these @xmath32 @xmath0 bound states occurs after the production of @xmath1 and through the coalescence mechanism , similar to that of x(3872 ) in the molecular picture @xcite .",
    "once the molecules are formed , they would be rather stable because they do not decay through strong interactions .",
    "possible places to search for them are gsi - fair , j - parc , and rhic .",
    "it is also possible to look for them at belle .    in summary",
    ", we have obtained effective lagrangians describing the charmed baryon interactions with light mesons according to the heavy quark symmetry , chiral symmetry , and hidden local symmetry .",
    "we estimate the coupling constants with various methods and get consistent results . based on these interaction lagrangians ,",
    "one - boson exchange potentials for the @xmath33 systems are derived . with the cutoffs around 1 gev , it is possible to get binding solutions by solving the bound state problem with the variational method .",
    "one finds that the channel coupling has very important effects for the possible molecular bound states .",
    "these effects do not significantly change the feature that the binding solutions are spin - independent .",
    "if these states exist , the reasonable binding energies should be at most tens of mev .",
