    "hadron cocktail \" , a full scale data - constrained monte - carlo simulation has been used .",
    "realistic spectra of the dominant background sources ( @xmath3 , k , p , etc . ) were generated as an initial estimation .",
    "the generated particles were propagated through the simulated geometry using geant . in the case where one is analyzing heavy - ion collisions , simulated tracks were  embedded \" into real events to reproduce the effects of the detector environment during the heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally , the input spectra of the hadron cocktail were modified to match the hadron fluxes measured in the shallower layers of the muon identifier .",
    "simultaneously , the background prediction was required to correctly reproduce the vertex dependence of the yield caused by the muons originating from the decays of light hadrons near the collision point .",
    "single muons are separately measured in each of the two muon arms , as illustrated in figure  [ both_arms ] , which are then combined to form the final measurement . for symmetric collisions",
    ", the consistency between the two measurements leads to a reduction in the overall systematic uncertainties and provides further confidence in the final results .",
    "the single muon spectra have been measured for three different centrality classes and compared to the baseline measurement made in p+p collisions @xcite , as shown in figure  [ all_spectra ] .",
    "these are then used to construct the @xmath0 variable for each centrality class . despite sizable systematic uncertainties , a significant suppression in single muon production is observed for the most central cu+cu collisions , as illustrated in figure  [ muon_raa ] , which is comparable to the suppression observed for high-@xmath4 non - photonic electrons at mid - rapidity measured in the most central au+au collisions shown on figure  [ el_vs_mu ] ."
