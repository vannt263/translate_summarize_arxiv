    "cosmological observations have established the existence of the non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the dm is a stable and weakly - interacting particle with a mass of @xmath1 gev .",
    "many hypothetical candidates for the dm have been proposed in models of particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and one of the most attractive candidates is the lightest neutralino , @xmath2 , in supersymmetric extensions of the sm with @xmath3 parity conservation .",
    "neutralino is a linear combination of the superpartners of @xmath4 gauge bosons and the two neutral higgses , and is stable when it is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "indeed it accounts for the observed dm abundance when it is degenerate in mass to the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) and hence coannihilates with the nlsp @xcite .",
    "we consider the setup that the lsp is a neutralino consisting of mainly bino , the superpartner of @xmath5 gauge boson , and the nlsp is the lighter stau , the superpartner of tau lepton .",
    "this is naturally realized in the mssm with the unification condition at the grand unified theory scale .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) has two eigenstates of stau as physical state . in absence of inter - generational mixing the mass eigenstate of stau",
    "is given by the linear combination of the left - handed stau @xmath6 and the right - handed stau @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the left - right mixing angle and @xmath10 is the cp violating phase .    in a scenario of the coannihilation , the nlsp stau can be long - lived if the mass difference , @xmath11 , between neutralino and stau is small enough to forbid two - body decays of stau into neutralino .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the lifetime of stau is longer than @xmath12 second for @xmath13 mev .",
    "it is known @xcite that the long - lived charged particles affect the relic abundance of the light nuclei during or after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "there is a discrepancy , the so - called @xmath14li problem , on the primordial @xmath14li abundance between the prediction from the standard bbn ( sbbn ) and the observations @xcite . combined with the up - to - date values of baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath15 from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite",
    ", the sbbn predicts the @xmath16 to proton ratio , @xmath17 , which is by about four - times larger than its observed value in poor - metal halos @xcite .",
    "because there exists no general agreements about astrophysical scenarios to reduce the @xmath14li abundance @xcite , it is natural to consider nonstandard effects .",
    "the authors have investigated the bbn including the long - lived stau @xcite . the long - lived stau form a bound state with nuclei @xmath18 , and",

    "@xmath19 stands for a nucleus . in this scenario ,",
    "the abundance of @xmath14li is reduced through the conversion process , @xmath20 and the further destruction of @xmath16 by either a collision with a background proton or another conversion process , @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the more these bound states are formed , the more the @xmath14li abundance is reduced .",
    "the number density of the bound state is determined by the relic density of stau . in @xcite",
    ", we assumed @xmath22 and @xmath11 to be free parameters of the scenario , where @xmath22 is the yield value of stau at the time of decoupling from the thermal bath .",
    "the full calculation of the light nucleus abundances showed a region in @xmath23 plane where the @xmath14li problem is solved consistently with the observational constraints on the other nuclei .",
    "the region points @xmath24 to be close to the yeild value of the dm and @xmath11 to be around @xmath25 gev , respectively .    in this work ,",
    "we improve our previous analysis by calculating @xmath26 with taking the relic abundance of dm into account .",

    ", we review the formalism for the calculation of the relic density of stau , and derive the boltzmann equations of stau and neutralino for the calculation . in section [ numerical ] , we present the numerical results of the calculation , and prove the parameter space for solving the @xmath14li problem . section [ summary ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we prepare to calculate the relic density of stau at the bbn era .",
    "firstly , in subsection [ bol ] , we briefly review the boltzmann equations for the number density of stau and neutralino based on the thermal relic scenario .",
    "then , in subsection [ evo ] , we discuss the number density evolution of stau and neutralino quantitatively . in subsection",
    "[ ex pro ] , we investigate the significant processes for the calculation of the relic density of stau . finally , we obtain the boltzmann equations for the relic density of stau in a convenient form .      in this subsection",

    "we are interested in the relic density of stau in the coannihilation scenario . in this scenario ,",
    "stau and neutralino are quasi - degenerate in mass and decouple from the thermal bath almost at the same time @xcite . thus the relic density of stau",

    "as shown later , the final number density of neutralino dm is controlled only by these processes .",
    "the second line accounts for the exchange processes by scattering off the cosmic thermal background ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "these processes exchange stau with neutralino and vice versa , and thermalize them .",

    "note that in general , although there are terms which account for decay and inverse decay processes of stau ( @xmath48 ) in the boltzmann equations , we omit them .",
    "it is because we are interested in solving the @xmath14li problem by the long - lived stau , and the whole intention of this work is to search parameters which can provide the solution for the @xmath14li problem .",
    "hence we assume that the stau is stable enough to survire until the bbn era , and focusing on the mass difference between stau and neutralino is small enough to make it possible .      in this subsection",

    "firstly , we discuss the number density evolution of neutralino dm . since we have assumed r - parity conservation , all of the supersymmetric particles eventually decay into the lsp neutralino .",
    "thus its final number density is simply described by the sum of the number density of all the supersymmetric particles : @xmath49 for @xmath19 , that is the number density of the neutralino , we get the boltzmann equation by summing up eqs .",

    "( [ e ] ) , we obtain @xmath19 and find the freeze out temperature of the total number density of all the supersymmetric particles @xmath52 by using the standard technique @xcite : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the internal degrees of freedom and the mass of neutralino , respectively .",
    "the planck mass @xmath56 gev , and @xmath57 are the total number of the relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "consequently , we see that 4 gev @xmath58 40 gev for 100 gev @xmath59 1000 gev .",
    "now we will discuss the number density evolution of stau . to obtain the relic density of stau ,",
    "we solve a coupled set of the boltzmann equations , ( [ a ] ) , ( [ b ] ) , and ( [ c ] ) , as simultaneous differential equation .",
    "each boltzmann equation contains the contributions of the exchange processes .",
    "these processes exchange stau with neutralino and vice versa .",
    "at the temperature @xmath52 , the interaction rate of the exchange processes is much larger than that of the annihilation and the inverse annihilation processes .",
    "this is because the cross sections of the exchange processes are in the same order of magnitude as that of the annihilation and the inverse annihilation , but the number density of the sm particles is much larger than that of the supersymmetric particles which is suppressed by the boltzmann factor .",
    "thus even if the total number density of stau and neutralino is frozen out at the temperature @xmath52 , each number density of them continue to evolve through the exchange processes .",
    "thus , to calculate the relic density of stau , we have to follow the two - step procedures . as a first step ,",
    "we calculate the total relic density of the supersymmetric particles by solving the eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) .",
    "we use the publicly available program micromegas @xcite to calculate it .",
    "the second step is the calculation of the number density ratio of stau and neutralino .",
    "the second step is significant for calculating the relic density of stau at the bbn era , and hence we will discuss it in detail in the next subsection .",
    "after the freeze - out of the total number density of stau and neutralino , each of them is exchanged through the following processes @xmath60 notice that although there are other exchange processes via weak interaction ( for example , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and so on ) , we can omit them .",
    "this is because the number density of w boson is not enough to work these processes sufficiently due to the boltzmann factor suppression , and the final state w boson is kinematically forbidden when the thermal bath temperature is less than @xmath52 .",
    "these processes ( eq . ( [ exchange ] ) ) are described by the lagrangian @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the projection operators , and @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are the coupling constants , given by @xmath70 where @xmath54 is the @xmath71 gauge coupling constant , and @xmath72 is the weinberg angle .    the evolution of the stau number density is governed only by the exchange processes ( eq.([exchange ] ) ) after the freeze - out of the total relic density of stau and neutralino .",
    "when we calculate it , we should pay attention to two essential points relevant to the exchange processes .",
    "one is the competition between the interaction rate of the exchange processes and the hubble expansion rate , since when these interaction rates get smaller than the hubble expansion rate , the relic density of stau would be frozen out .",
    "the other is whether tau leptons are in the thermal bath or not .",
    "the interaction rate of the exchange processes strongly depends on the number density of tau leptons .",
    "when tau leptons are in the thermal bath , the number density ratio between stau and neutralino are given by the thermal ratio , @xmath73 through the exchange processes .",
    "on the contrary , once tau leptons decouple from the thermal bath , the ratio can not reach this value . to calculate the relic density of stau",
    ", we have to comprehend the temperature of tau lepton decoupling .    [ t ! ]        to see whether tau leptons are in the thermal bath or not , we consider the boltzmann equation for its number density , @xmath74 , @xmath75    \\\\     & - \\langle \\gamma \\rangle \\biggl [   n_{\\tau } - n_{\\tau}^{eq }      \\left ( \\frac{n_x n_y ... } { n_x^{eq } n_y^{eq } ... } \\right ) \\biggr ] ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath76 where indices @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath77 denote the sm particles , and @xmath78 represents the thermal averaged decay rate of tau lepton .",
    "when the sm particles @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath77 are in the thermal equilibrium , @xmath79 , and hence tau leptons are sufficiently produced through the inverse annihilation and/or the inverse decay processes as long as these interaction rates are larger than the hubble expansion rate . therefore , whether tau leptons are in the thermal bath or not can be distinguished by comparing the hubble expansion rate @xmath32 with the inverse annihilation rate of tau lepton @xmath80 , and the inverse decay rate of tau lepton @xmath81 . in other words , the inequality expression @xmath82 indicates that tau leptons are in the thermal bath .",
    "1 shows @xmath83 , @xmath78 , and @xmath32 as a function of the thermal bath temperature . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the inverse decay rate of tau lepton is much larger than the hubble expansion rate .",
    "thus , we can conclude that tau leptons remain in the thermal bath still at the beginning of the bbn .",

    ", we use the upper bound  @xcite , @xmath146 with a conservative systematic error ( + 0.106 )  @xcite . for the @xmath14li abundance ,",
    "we adopt two observational values of the @xmath147 to @xmath148 ratio .",

    "@xcite , and on the other hand , a milder one was also given by ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath150    in the current scenario @xmath141li can be overproduced by the scattering of the bound state @xmath151 off the background deuterium through @xmath152  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of the nonthermally - produced @xmath136li through this process is approximately represented by @xmath153 with @xmath154 the thermal average of the cross section times the relative velocity for this process  @xcite , and @xmath155 the number density of deuterium . by using ( [ eq : li6obs ] ) , we see that the additional @xmath141li production is constrained to be @xmath156 .",
    "numerical value of @xmath154 gives @xmath157 at @xmath15810 kev .",
    "then from ( [ eq : deltayli6 ] ) it is found that the upper bound on the abundance of stau should be @xmath159 . because the bound state @xmath151 forms at @xmath16010 kev ,",
    "this process is strongly constrained for @xmath161 with @xmath162 being the stau lifetime , which corresponds to @xmath13 mev .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath163 rapidly decreases as the cosmic temperature decreases , and this nonthermal production of @xmath136li is much more effective just after formation of the bound state .",
    "this is the reason why we can estimate ( [ eq : deltayli6 ] ) at around 10 kev .    on the other hand",
    ", the rates of @xmath164be and @xmath164li destruction through the internal conversion  @xcite could be nearly equal to the formation rates of the bound sate @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively .",
    "this is because the timescale of the destruction through the internal conversion is much faster than that of any other nuclear reaction rates and the hubble expansion rate .",
    "then the destroyed amount of @xmath164be ( or @xmath164li after its electron capture ) is approximately represented by @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the thermally - averaged cross section times the relative velocity of the bound - state formation for @xmath169  @xcite .",
    "we request @xmath170 to become @xmath171 to reduce the abundance of @xmath172 to fit the observational data . then the abundance of @xmath173 should be the order of @xmath174 with @xmath175 at @xmath84 = 30 kev . because @xmath176 decreases as the cosmic temperature decreases ( @xmath177 ) ,",
    "the destruction is more effective just after the formation of the bound state .",
    "this validates that we have estimated ( [ eq : delta7 ] ) at 30 kev .",
    "therefore the parameter region at around @xmath178 and @xmath179  130  mev is allowed by the observational @xmath164li . here",
    "@xmath180  130  mev corresponds to @xmath181  s. the case for the destruction of ( @xmath164li@xmath173 ) through the internal conversion is also similar to that of ( @xmath164be@xmath173 )  @xcite .",
    "further constraints come from the relic density of the dm , which can be stated in terms of the stau relic density .",
    "it is calculated as shown in fig .",

    "based on the discussion in previous subsection , we took @xmath183 .",

    "red crisscross points show the parameters which are consistent with the observational abundances for the light elements including @xmath186 , where the observational @xmath186 abundance is yielded by literature @xcite .",
    "the abundance of the light elements constrains the parameter space due to the following reasons .",
    "first , the region where the stau mass is less than 300 gev is excluded since the relic density becomes too small to destruct @xmath187 sufficiently .",
    "next , the top - left region of the figure is excluded since the lifetime of stau becomes too long and hence overproduces @xmath188 through the catalyzed fusion @xcite .",
    "indeed , the lifetime of stau gets longer as its mass gets heavier due to the small phase space of the final state @xcite . on the other hand , its lifetime gets shorter as the left - right mixing angle increases in the present parameter space @xcite . as a result",
    ", the final allowed region becomes as shown by the red crisscrosses in fig .",
    "[ allowed ] .    the black solid curve and the blue dashed curve are the constraints from the relic abundance of the dm as discussed in subsection [ total abundance ] .",
    "note that the relic abundance is insensitive to the mass difference @xmath11 for @xmath189 .",
    "combination of the constraints on the abundance of the light elements and of the dm strongly restricts the allowed region and leads to @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : allowed3sigma ] , these parameter values correspond to the white triangular region below the allowed region ( thick line ) .",
    "our model can thus provide a handle to the mixing angle , which has few experimental signals , once the value of @xmath111 is determined .",
    "we have studied the evolution of stau number density in the mssm coannihilation scenario , in which the lsp and the nlsp are the lightest neutralino and the lighter stau , respectively , and have a small mass difference @xmath193(1gev ) . in this case",
    ", stau can survive until the bbn era , and provide additional nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to see how large the relic density of stau is at the bbn era .",
    "we have shown the boltzmann equations for the calculation of the relic number density of stau , and have found that the number density of stau continues to evolve through the exchange processes eq.([exchange ] ) , even after the relic abundance of the dm is frozen out .",
    "thus , we need to calculate the stau relic density by a two - step procedure . in the first step , we calculate the total abundance of stau and neutralino , which corresponds to the relic abundance of the dm .",
    "the total abundance is controlled only by pair annihilation processes of the supersymmetric particles . in the second step ,",
    "we calculate the ratio of the stau number density to the total number density of stau and neutralino , which is governed only by the exchange processes .",
    "we have calculated the relic density of stau at the bbn era by solving the boltzmann equations numerically .",
    "the freeze - out temperature @xmath125 is determined by @xmath126 and the relic density of stau are given by eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) .",
    "thus it becomes larger as the mass difference between stau and neutralino gets smaller .",
    "our method of calculation is generally applicable to obtain the density of exotic heavy particles that coannihilate with other ( quasi)stable particles : we calculate the total number density of these particles and then calculate the ratio among them by evaluating the exchange processes such as eq .",
    "( [ exchange ] ) .",
    "this method of calculation can be found versatile in various scenarios including the catalyzed bbn and the exotic cosmological structure formation .    at the bbn era ,",
    "the long - lived stau form bound states with nuclei , and provide exotic nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "one of them is the internal conversion process , which offers a possible solution to the @xmath186 problem . applying the calculated relic density of stau",
