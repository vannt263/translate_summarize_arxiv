    "since bl lac objects are dominated by radiation from a ( presumably ) relativistic jet pointing almost directly towards the observer , their host galaxies and close environment are hard to study .",
    "this problem is accompanied by their cosmological distances . naturally , its a challenge for each observer in order to separate the contribution of the host galaxy or even the close environment from the bl lac itself . for the cluster environment ,",
    "the bl lac itself is not a problem .",
    "here the observer has to deal with a wide range of uncertainties such as the proper determination and separation of the background from any putative cluster environment .",
    "the study of both , the hosts and any cluster environments are hampered by the fact that large telescopes with sufficient resolution and large detectors ( and good - will tacs ) are needed in order to reach the limiting magnitudes required .",
    "still , such studies are important as they can provide answers for at least some of the questions related to our understanding of bl lac objects and the agn phenomenon in general .",
    "most quoted questions are : what are the hosts of bl lac objects ( disks / ellipticals ) , what is their morphology and how do they compare to `` normal '' galaxies ? do they reside in clusters ?",
    "do they show any cosmological evolution of their hosts or cluster environment ?",
    "do their hosts or cluster environment show any correlation with intrinsic properties or differences between hbl and lbl ? how do the properties of the hosts and cluster environment compare to those of their `` parents '' , the fanaroff - riley i ( fr i ) radio galaxies ?",
    "are tidal forces important in triggering and maintaining the activity in these sources ? and finally : are ( some ) bl lac objects actually lensed qsos ?",
    "although bl lac objects are now known for about 30 years , much of our current understanding of the properties of their hosts and environment has been emerged in recent years .",
    "this is mainly due to the large telescopes offering excellent seeing conditions now available in combination with dedicated analysis packages .    in this review",
    "i will first give a brief history about the first 20 years since the identification of bl lac with a radio source .",
    "than i will describe step by step what we know about bl lac host galaxies , their close environment and their cluster environment and will finally present a few key issues , which should be investigated in the future .",
    "although the whole story begun already with the identification of the `` variable '' star bl lac with a radio source by schmitt ( 1968 ) @xmath0 where he noted `` .. marginal nebulosity about the star . ''",
    "@xmath0 only few studies were carried out on this new class of objects .",
    "milestones in the first 10 years were the ( wrong ) claim of a bl lac in a cluster of galaxies ( disney , 1974 ) , consistency of the surface brightness profile of bl lac with that of an elliptical galaxy at z = 0.07 ( kinman , 1975 ) and the first spectroscopical confirmation of a close companion ( 30 kpc ) to a bl lac by baldwin et al .",

    "although the number of bl lac objects grew by a factor of three during the next decade , most observations still concentrated on the previously studied objects making use of the new ccds .",
    "weistrop et al ( 1979 ) were the first , who carried out surface photometry using such a ccd and decomposed the resulting 1-dim surface brightness profile into core and host galaxy .",
    "weistrop et al . (",

    "the properties of the hosts of about 15/120 bl lac objects were known ( ulrich , 1989 ) , but their close environment and cluster properties were still poorly understood .",
    "the como meeting essentially marked the `` kick - off '' . with the upcoming availability of large , well defined samples of bl lac objects (",
    "e.g. the 1 jy sample ) systematic investigations were possible .",
    "nowadays , @xmath1 300 bl lac objects are known , about one third have been imaged to study their hosts and about one quarter have been imaged for their cluster environment .",

    "however , even during the course of a long - term project aiming in detecting microlensing events in a large sample of qsos and bl lac objects , no clear microlensing event was detected ( borgeest & schramm 1993 ) .",
    "signatures for lensing ( e.g. multiple images ) has only been observed in b2 0218 + 357 .",
    "further candidates are ms 0205.7 + 3559 and pks 1413 + 135 and virtually all 7 bl lac objects , where signatures of absorbing systems in their spectra have been observed . in fact , in two of those ( pks 0139 - 097 and pks 0118 - 272 ) absorbing systems have been detected through imaging ( heidt et al .",

    "therefore , most information have been derived from deep high - resolution imaging .",
    "evidence for interaction ( projected distance 25 - 100 kpc ) with bright companions have been observed through imaging and partly been confirmed via spectroscopy e.g. in pks 0548@xmath0322 , ap lib and 3c 371 ( stickel et al .",

    "the high frequency of close companion galaxies and the evidence for gravitational interaction in some sources indicates that tidal forces might be important for triggering and maintaining the activity in at least some bl lac objects .",
    "based on the small amount of data available it is not clear , if this is a general requirement .",
    "the main problem is the lack of redshifts for most of the companion galaxies . a systematic study of this phenomenon and the comparison with `` normal '' galaxies , might be an important work in the future .",
    "characterizing and quantifying the cluster environment of bl lac objects is a rather tricky subject . since spectroscopical studies of a large number of galaxies nearby bl lac objects are entirely lacking ( and unlikely to be conducted in the very near future ) , the analysis is based on the examination of an excess of galaxies in the fields around bl lac objects as compared to the background .",
    "this is hampered by several problems , e.g. the proper determination of the background ( and foreground for high - redshift sources ) due to the limited field of view , limiting magnitudes of the observations , seeing etc .",
    "there are two principles to estimate an excess of galaxies within a given radius around the bl lac ( typically 500 kpc ) as compared to the background .",
    "the first is the calculation of the spatial covariance amplitude as introduced by longair & seldner ( 1979 ) , the second , more robust estimate , is to count the number of galaxies above a certain magnitude limit determined by the third - ranked cluster galaxy ( m @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the third - ranked cluster galaxy ( bahcall 1981 ) ) . for both methods",

    "there is an indication for evolution with redshift ( richer clusters ) and there is no good match with the cluster environment of fr i. however , the properties of the cluster environment at redshifts above 0.7 are completely unknown .",
    "an example of a typical cluster environment is shown in figure 3 .",
    "our current knowledge of the host galaxies and cluster environment of bl lac objects can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) bl lac objects are hosted by luminous and large elliptical galaxies ( @xmath1523.5 , @xmath3 = 10 kpc ) .",

    "5 ) both , the host galaxies and cluster environment show indication for evolution with redshift ( brighter hosts and denser environments ) .",
    "6 ) the properties of the hosts and cluster environment of bl lac objects do not match those of the fr i very well .",
    "therefore the unified scheme has to be modified .",
    "either , fr ii should at least in part be included , or the brightest fr i and/or the fr i in rich clusters have to be excluded .",
    "since we are now know the general properties of the hosts and cluster environment of ( at least nearby ) bl lac objects quite well , we can now start to tackle a few issues in more detail .",
    "currently , there are several projects underway ( c.f .",
    "laurent - muehleisen this proceedings ) , which will strongly increase the number of bl lac objects thus allowing to construct well defined samples of bl lac objects e.g. at low redshifts . from the observational side , the data gathered during the hst snap survey offer a unique opportunity to study the host galaxies of bl lac objects with exceptional resolution and to identify close and faint companion galaxies .",
    "very large telescopes ( vlt , het , lbt ) will allow to carry out spectroscopy of bl lac host galaxies and even very faint companion galaxies .",
    "future observing programmes should include :    * imaging of high - redshift bl lac objects ( perhaps also those without known redshift ) .",
