    "relativistic jets are common characters of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . according to the different morphology of their radio structures",
    ", the radio galaxies can be divided into two classes , i.e. , fri ( defined by edge - darkened radio lobes ) and frii ( defined by edge - brightened radio lobes and hot spots ) @xcite .",
    "several recent observations discovered that the jet efficiency ( defined as @xmath3 ) of some luminous lobe - dominated frii could be very high , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the jet power and the bolometric luminosity of agns , respectively ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafer p11 ) .",
    "a maximum jet efficiency @xmath6 was found by @xcite , where they adopted a complete sample of the most powerful radio galaxies at redshift @xmath7 .",
    "p11 extended the results of @xcite and found that the maximum jet efficiency line can cover the full four order of magnitudes of jet power by including other samples , such as , a blazar sample in @xcite , a small sample of x - ray cavities in @xcite , etc .",
    "there are mainly two most popular jet formation mechanisms so far , i.e. , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite and the blandford - payne ( bp ) process @xcite . in bz process",
    ", the rotating energy of a black hole can be extracted to power a jet by the large scale magnetic fields maintained by an accretion disk .",
    "but in bp process , the jet power comes from the rotating disk itself instead .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of a radio galaxy can be expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion disk .",
    "if we specify the jet power as a function of accretion rate , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the jet production efficiency ) , the jet efficiency @xmath12 will be decided by both @xmath11 and @xmath9 .",
    "the obviously different accretion rate between fri and frii radio galaxies implies that they should have different accretion model @xcite . in the general picture of frii radio galaxies ,",
    "jet is supposed to be launched from a ridiatively efficient accretion disk , where @xmath9 varies from about @xmath13 to @xmath14 for a non - rotating black hole and a extreme kerr black hole , respectively .",
    "recent grmhd simulations on jet formation mainly focused on the improvement of jet power @xmath4 in order to explain the observed high jet production efficiency @xmath11 . the jet production efficiency for a magnetically - arrested - disk ( mad )",
    "can reach @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively @xcite , which implies that the black hole spin parameter @xmath19 may play a key role in the formation of jets @xcite . however , the observed @xmath11 is based on an assumption that the radiative efficiency @xmath20 , which is suggested from observational constraints on the growth of massive black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if the radiative efficiency of a disk were much smaller than @xmath21 , it is possible to get a high jet efficiency @xmath22 even for conventional jet production efficiency @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite do seem to provide a possible way for this picture .",
    "they produced a model for a thin disk with magnetically driven winds / jets , in which the angular momentum and energy carried away by jets are properly included .",
    "it was found that the disk properties can be changed significantly by the feedback of jets .",
    "for example , the temperature of a thin disk with jets is obviously lower compared with that of a standard thin disk ( see figure 1 , * ? ? ? * ) for the reason that a large fraction of gravitational energy released in the disk is carried away by jets .",
    "this will directly result in the decrease of bolometric luminosity ( and @xmath9 ) of the accretion disk and the increase of jet efficiency @xmath22 . in this work",
    ", we will detailedly investigate the structure of a thin disk with winds and the high efficiency jets in powerful lobe - dominated frii radio galaxies .",
    "we consider a thin disk with magnetically driven winds surrounding a spinning black hole .",
    "the continuity , radial momentum , angular momentum and energy equations of the disk are as follows : @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    where the equations and the meaning of parameters are all the same as @xcite .",
    "we focus on the fast moving jets from the disk and adopt @xmath27 , which corresponds to the case of fast moving jets with low mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "so we can simply ignore the mass loss rate term in the continuity equation .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of accretion disk can be calculated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are the inner and outer radius of disk , respectively , @xmath32 is the innermost stable circular orbit of disk .",
    "@xmath33 is the radiative cooling rate per unit surface and @xmath9 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion disk .",
    "jets can be powered by both bz and bp processes . in the general form of the bz process",
    ", the jet power @xmath34 can be estimated with @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the horizon radius , @xmath37 is the component of the magnetic field normal to the black hole horizon , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the angular momentum and maximum angular momentum of a black hole , and @xmath40 is a factor at black hole horizon determined by the angular velocity of black hole and magnetic filed lines .",
    "the strength of the field threading the horizon of black hole ( @xmath37 ) is comparable to that threading the inner region of the disk @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we adopt @xmath37 as the maximal magnetic field strength in the disk for simplicity .",
    "the power of the jets accelerated from an accretion disk ( bp process ) can be calculated with ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the toroidal and poloidal components of magnetic field , respectively .",

    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines are for @xmath57 and @xmath58 degrees , respectively .",
    "[ ljettheta],width=302 ]    we solve equations ( [ continuity ] ) - ( [ energy ] ) to achieve the structure of a thin disk with winds by using the same numerical methods as @xcite . in all the calculations , we adopt the conventional viscosity parameter @xmath59 , black hole mass @xmath60 ( except for figures [ ljet ] , [ ljettheta ] ) and eddington - scale accretion rate @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the typical value of broad - line agns @xcite .",
    "our results are qualitatively the same for different black hole mass and accretion rate .    in figure [ properties",
    "] , it is found that the disk structure has been significantly altered by the winds .",
    "the temperature of a thin disk with winds is obviously lower than that of a standard thin disk , because a large fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disk is carried away by the jets ( see figure [ properties]a ) , and gradually decreases with increasing magnetic field strength [ smaller @xmath47 , @xmath64 . except for the temperature ,",
    "the disk density and surface density also exhibit enormous changes as presented in figure [ properties]b , c. especially for the inner disk region , both the density and surface density increase greatly . in figure",
    "[ properties]d , it is found the magnetic torque is far more larger than the viscous torque for the disk with strong winds . when the magnetic field is strong enough ( @xmath65 ) , the radiative pressure dominated inner region in a thin disk vanishes and the whole disk",
    "is dominated by gas pressure ( figure [ pressure ] ) .",
    "the change of pressure in inner disk also induces the change of disk density : the initial negative correlation between the density and radius has become positive ( figure [ properties]b ) , which is a result of gas pressure dominated inner disk .",
    "the radiative efficiency @xmath9 varied with @xmath47 for different black hole spin is plotted in figure [ radiative ] . in this work ,",
    "a minimal @xmath66 is adopted for the reasons that the jet efficiency @xmath22 ( @xmath67 , see figure [ r ] ) is high enough for @xmath66 and that mri will be totally suppressed if @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath9 decreases fast with decreasing @xmath47 and can be as low as @xmath69 for different @xmath19 with @xmath55 , which is about @xmath70 of the efficiency of a standard thin disk .",
    "contrary to @xmath9 , the jet production efficiency @xmath11 decreases rapidly with the increase of @xmath47 ( figure [ jet ] ) .",
    "the structure of a thin disk with lower spin is found to be changed relatively easier .",
    "but the results are qualitatively the same for different spin @xmath19 ( figures , [ radiative ] and [ jet ] ) .",
    "as @xmath47 becomes smaller and smaller , the simultaneous increase of @xmath11 and the decrease of @xmath9 will result in a rapid increase of jet efficiency @xmath22 ( see figure [ r ] ) .",
    "the maximum theoretical jet efficiency can reach from several hundreds to @xmath71 for different spin @xmath19 with @xmath55 , which can easily explain the observational high jet efficiency in luminous frii radio galaxies . in figure [ ljet ] , we also draw the jet power as functions of disk bolometric luminosity as figure @xmath68 in p11 , where the black hole mass varies from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . compared with the observational maximum jet efficiency ( the dashed line ) , our results suggest that the magnetic pressure is about @xmath72 of the gas+radiation pressure in the disk ( @xmath73 ) when",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath74 are adopted .    an inclination angle @xmath54 of the field line with respect to the disk surface is required to be smaller than @xmath75 degrees in order to successfully launch jets from a cold thin disk @xcite .",
    "we simply adopt an angle of @xmath75 degrees in this work except for figure [ ljettheta ] . in figure [ ljettheta ]",
    ", we investigate the effects of inclination angle @xmath54 on the jet power .",
    "it is found that the inclination angle strongly affects the jet power and the jet efficiency fast decreases with decreasing @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 , the jet efficiency decreases for about two order of magnitudes when @xmath54 varies from @xmath75 degrees to @xmath58 degrees .",
    "the jet efficiency @xmath22 is reduced to @xmath76 for @xmath55 and @xmath77 .",
    "the basic physics of the jet formation models adopted in this work are the same as the previous works of @xcite and @xcite . however , their estimates of the magnetic field strength of a disk are based on the conventional accretion disk models without magnetic field , which is a good approximation in the weak magnetic field case as the disk structure has not been altered significantly by the field .",
    "but that assumption becomes invalid if the field is strong .",
    "the high power carried by the jets has greatly changed the structure of a thin disk ( figure [ properties ] , [ pressure ] ) . except for the angular velocity , which is close to keplerian angular velocity for a thin disk @xcite , all other disk properties ( temperature , density , surface density , pressure ) change a lot compared with the standard disk .",
    "the magnetic torque @xmath78 is found to dominate over the viscous torque @xmath79 ( see figure [ properties]d ) .",
    "the temperature decreases and the density increases significantly with decreasing @xmath47 .",
    "it is the increase of surface density and the decrease of disk temperature in the inner disk region that result in the very low radiative efficiency in the disk .",
    "the obviously lower temperature compared with that of a standard thin disk even leads to the disappearance of the inner disk dominated by radiative pressure ( figure [ pressure ] ) .",
    "thus , the thin disk becomes both thermally and viscously stable on the presence of disk winds @xcite .",
    "previous efforts mainly focused on the improvement of jet power @xmath4 .",
    "but indeed , if the accumulation of magnetic flux in the inner region of accretion disk is considered @xcite , not only can the jet production efficiency be improved significantly , the radiative efficiency can also decrease a lot .",
    "thus , a very high jet production efficiency @xmath11 is nt always needed .",
    "the jet efficiency could be quite normal if the radiative efficiency decreases significantly ( see figure [ radiative ] , [ jet ] ) . according to our model , the reason for the high jet efficiency is that most of released gravitational energy in the disk is carried away by jets , which results in the very low radiative efficiency .",
    "a theoretical maximum jet efficiency @xmath80 is found , which is large enough even we take the episodic activity of jets into account .",
    "compared with the observational results in p11 ( the dashed line in figure [ ljet ] ) , our study indicates that @xmath81 is required for @xmath59 and @xmath74 .",
    "but if we consider smaller @xmath82 and larger proportion of @xmath42 in the field , the magnetic torque could be more dominant @xcite .",
    "thus the required field could be much weaker ( larger @xmath47 ) . from figure [ ljettheta ]",
    ", it seems that the jet efficiency has a positive relation with @xmath54 .",
    "but if we consider the evolution of field in a thin disk , the smaller @xmath54 may represent a stronger magnetic field @xcite , which should thus help to improve the jet efficiency .",
    "the large scale magnetic field plays a key role in the formation of jet . but",
    "how it forms is still an unsolved problem .",
    "a popular mechanism is that the field lines can be dragged inwards with the accretion of gas .",
    "the magnification of field seems to be hard in a thin disk because the speed of turbulent diffusion is faster than that of advection @xcite .",
    "but when taking the magnetically driven winds into account @xcite , the field may be effectively magnified even for a thin disk with very weak initial field ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , a balance of magnetic field advection and diffusion is required in order to avoid the formation of a mad .",
    "how such a balance can be achieved and kept stable are still unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued that a disk - wind system may be unstable if its angular momentum is taken away by magnetic torque only .",
    "the reason is that if there is a perturbation which increases the radial velocity , the inclination angle of the field will become smaller , which in turn increases the mass - loss rate and results in a higher radial velocity .",
    "nevertheless , the linear stability analysis given by @xcite suggested that a disk could be stable if the field is weak enough .",
    "@xcite also stated that they did nt do a global calculation on the disk .",
    "thus , a global time - dependent study should be necessary in order to investigate this problem , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the formation of large scale magnetic field also depends on the initial strength and morphology of magnetic field as indicated by some mhd simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is still an open issue at present .",
