    "the famous coulomb potential of electrodynamics is very important as an essential ingredient in any non - relativistic problem involving charged particles and consequently as being responsible for many phenomena in everyday life .",
    "it is thus no surprise that its analogue in chromodynamics has also been of great interest since 20 years .",
    "although the qcd potential certainly is not as ubiquitous in the macroscopic world , it still represents a fundamental concept which , besides the fact that potential models have been astonishingly successful in the description of quarkonia , might give us some deeper understanding of non - abelian theories and especially of confinement .",
    "there is , of course , no known way to analytically derive the confining part of the potential from first principles up to now , and consequently this paper will also be restricted to an analysis of the perturbative part .",
    "nevertheless one may hope to obtain some hints on the non - perturbative regime in this way .",
    "in addition , a calculation of the perturbative potential is required for comparisons between continuum qcd and lattice results .",
    "the first investigations of the interaction energy between an infinitely heavy quark - antiquark pair date back to 1977 @xcite and were initiated by l. susskind s les houches lectures @xcite . in",
    "these works some general properties of the static potential were discussed and the one - loop and parts of the higher - order diagrams were computed . in the years that followed ,",
    "much effort went into deriving ( quark - mass suppressed ) spin- and velocity - dependent corrections in various frameworks , but it is surprising that for a very long time there was no complete two - loop calculation of the true static case available .",
    "only recently has this gap been closed @xcite , and the present paper is essentially an extended version of @xcite presenting details about the two - loop calculation , which might be of interest for other problems as well .    before turning to the real problem , however , a brief description of the structure of the paper should not be missing : as an introduction of the notation and for illustrative purposes , the qed potential is discussed in section [ sec : qed ] , which is followed by a section describing the main additional problems encountered in the non - abelian theory .",
    "section [ sec : tech ] is concerned with the techniques needed for the actual two - loop calculation , and finally sections [ sec : res ] and [ sec : pos ] contain the result for the potential in momentum and position space , respectively .",
    "a definition of the static potential in qed which is both convenient for analytical and lattice calculations and which in addition is manifestly gauge invariant can be given as follows : +   + if we let @xmath2 approach infinity , the lines corresponding to @xmath3 will only give a negligible contribution to the line integral because the length of the integration path is much smaller than that of the other two lines ) that a small contribution from these two lines would indeed not affect the potential . ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath4 the path integral representation of the remaining expectation value equals the partition function of a system described by the usual ( purely photonic ) qed lagrangian with the addition of a source term @xmath5 with @xmath6;\\qquad      v_\\mu \\equiv \\delta_{\\mu0}.\\ ] ]    as the partition function is dominated by the ground state energy in this limit , i.e.  the path integral approaches @xmath7 , and as the ground state energy is exactly what we would term the potential , we are led to define @xmath8    for pure qed the vacuum expectation value is a gaussian path integral and an exact calculation is therefore possible , with the result @xmath9 where as the second term the expected coulomb potential appears , but there is also an infinite constant representing the self - energy of the sources known from classical electrodynamics .    an exact solution will no longer be possible as soon as light fermions are included or a non - abelian theory is considered .",
    "it is therefore useful to perform a perturbative analysis as well .",
    "the feynman rules for the sources can be read off easily : each source - photon vertex corresponds to a factor @xmath10 , an anti - source obtains an additional minus sign .",
    "when we expand the time - ordered exponential , we may introduce @xmath11-function to express the different possible time - orderings of the fields @xmath12 , and in turn can re - interpret them as source propagators in position space , @xmath13 the reverse time ordering must be used for the anti - source . transforming the expression to momentum space one obtains @xmath14 with @xmath15 for the anti - source .",
    "one should note that in the path - integral approach we could in fact omit the time - ordering prescription , as it is already implicit in that formalism , but the final integrals we would encounter would not be easier to solve .",
    "the approach we take , however , will prove to be very useful in the non - abelian theory .",
    "in addition , an immediate observation is that the feynman rules are exactly the same as those of heavy electron effective theory , the qed analogue of hqet , where @xmath16 would represent the electron s velocity .",
    "this comes as no surprise , as we are investigating the infinite mass limit of qed , and it is well known that the potential can also be derived from the scattering operator .",
    "the static qed potential thus should be derivable from the scattering matrix of heet , correspondingly the qcd potential from hqet , and this is in fact what is done in practice .",
    "this approach can even be used to determine the spin - dependent corrections to the potential @xcite .    at tree level ,",
    "one obtains the scattering amplitude @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the photon propagator . at first glance",
    "this seems to be the complete result already and one might wonder what happens with the higher order diagrams . but some care is required because the sum of all diagrams does not correspond to the potential , but to its exponential .",
    "that is exactly what the loop graphs are needed for . at one - loop order for example ,",
    "the ladder diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] appear . when working in position space it is easy to see that summing the two effectively removes the anti - source propagator  because it is only a @xmath11-function .",
    "hence , adding them once more with @xmath19 the source propagator is also removed and one finds @xmath20 ( a similar analysis in momentum space is also feasible , but more difficult @xcite . )",
    "it is clear from the way the ladder diagrams are constructed that this behaviour persists to all orders : the ladder diagrams are derived from the uncrossed ladder by permuting all vertices , i.e.  generating all time - orderings , on one of the two fermion lines .",
    "hence after summing all of them we end up with the uncrossed ladder again , where the @xmath11-functions on one of the fermion lines are removed .",
    "the source propagators on the other line are removed by adding the same sums , with all possible permutations of the names of the vertices , just as was done in the one - loop example . since there are @xmath21 permutations at @xmath22-loops , the exponential thus forms .",
    "the other types of graphs  source self - energy and vertex correction diagrams  can be shown , along the same line , to produce the products of the form @xmath23 predicted by the exact formula ( [ qed ] ) .",
    "if light fermions are to be included , an explicit exact expression for the potential can no longer be derived and one has to rely on the perturbative treatment .",
    "the effect of the fermions is to introduce a running coupling in two different ways .",
    "the obvious point is that fermion loops cause vacuum polarization effects , which can be accounted for by defining an effective charge in momentum space via @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the vacuum polarization function and @xmath26 the fine structure constant .",
    "this definition is gauge invariant and includes a dyson summation .",
    "one might thus guess that @xmath27 but the formula need only be correct at the one- and two - loop level , because starting at three loops light - by - light scattering diagrams enter .",
    "the correct formula should read @xmath28 with @xmath29 , which , however , merely serves as a definition of @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless , this definition is quite convenient , especially when turning to the non - abelian case where a gauge - invariant definition of an effective charge is nontrivial .",
    "one novelty that arises in qcd is well known : the non - linear nature of non - abelian theories introduces additional diagrams which cause a running coupling even in the absence of light fermions , and the fact that gluons carry colour also requires a redefinition of the wilson loop and consequently of the potential as follows : @xmath31 the generators @xmath32 have to be inserted in order to absorb the gluons colour index , and the fact that the generators do not commute requires the introduction of a path - ordering prescription .",
    "an important point is that this prescription is not automatically taken into account by using the path - integral formalism , in contrast to the time - ordering .",
    "consequently , all we can do even in the path - integral approach is use the definition of the path - ordered exponential , i.e.  expand it , and the usefulness of the way we analyzed the abelian case should become clearer .",
    "the net effect of the modifications in the non - abelian case is a complication of the way the exponentiation of the potential arises , and that the sources are automatically in a colour singlet state .    in principle",
    "we are free to choose any representation for the generators , but since we intend to describe quarks we are going to use the fundamental one . on tree level ,",
    "the only change with respect to qed then is the colour factor @xmath33 that multiplies the coupling in the potential , where @xmath34 is the number of colours and @xmath35 the normalization of the generators .",
    "it is thus convenient to define , in analogy to ( [ qedv ] ) , @xmath36 as this has the following advantage : @xmath37 is the value of the casimir operator @xmath38 * 1 * in the fundamental representation @xmath39 , where the @xmath40 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "if we chose the adjoint representation @xmath41 , which would be equally acceptable , the only thing that would change in ( [ qcdv ] ) is the overall factor @xmath37 which would be replaced by @xmath42 , the coupling @xmath30 would remain the same .",
    "the statement is trivial at tree level , but it is in fact true to all orders as will be explained after the discussion on the exponentiation . by choosing the adjoint representation",
    "we obtain the static potential for gluinos in a colour singlet state .    in higher orders the presence of the generators causes the individual diagrams to obtain different colour factors and",
    "consequently the exponentiation has to be more involved than in the abelian case .",
    "although this point has already been analyzed in @xcite , it seems appropriate to recall the discussion here .",
    "it should , however , suffice to consider the ladder diagrams to explain the basic idea .",
    "the qcd one - loop ladder diagrams corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] obtain the colour factors @xmath43 and we immediately can identify the abelian - like terms @xmath44 that are needed to build the exponential of the coulomb potential .",
    "but it is also obvious that the remainder of fig .",
    "[ fig : one]b , together with a contribution from the vertex corrections involving the same colour factor , gives an additional contribution to the potential , which then has to be exponentiated by the higher order diagrams .",
    "[ fig : two ] shows the two - loop ladder diagrams , which involve the colour factors @xmath45 as expected , each diagram contains the `` abelian '' term @xmath46 , thus forming an iteration of the tree - level potential , but the terms @xmath47 are also iterations , exactly those that arise from exponentiating the additional one - loop term .",
    "this can be seen as follows : when working in coordinate space and neglecting the colour factors , we can look for combinations of the diagrams in which one of the anti - source propagators is removed , with the result @xmath48 summing the three lines we find that the coefficients of @xmath49 in eqs .",
    "( [ tlbc][tlf ] ) equal the corresponding diagrams coefficients in the sum and that the @xmath11-functions fixing the position of the marked gluon line are removed .",
    "hence the sum is a product of one - gluon exchange and the crossed ladder diagram with exactly the right colour factor .",
    "a similar analysis for the remaining two - loop diagrams leads to the conclusion that the exponentiation works in the non - abelian case as well , and that all terms @xmath50 or @xmath51 indeed constitute iterations .    in consequence",
    ", the number of diagrams that really have to be computed to determine the two - loop contribution to the qcd potential is somewhat reduced .",
    "nevertheless , when compared to qed the number of diagrams is still quite large , as in the abelian case only very few remain ( essentially the vacuum polarization ) .",
    "having discussed the exponentiation we are able to proof the statement that @xmath30 is independent of the representation the sources are in .",
    "it is obvious that for any representation @xmath52 , the colour factor for a given diagram is the same as the one for @xmath53 if we replace @xmath37 by @xmath54 , because it is completely determined by the algebra of the generators : only @xmath54 and @xmath42 can appear since the generators themselves and the structure constants arising from commutators are the only `` matrices '' around , and their combination is fixed .",
    "we have also seen that at each loop order the only net contribution to the potential arises from the colour factors linear in @xmath37 , all other terms are iterations .",
    "the definition ( [ qcdv ] ) then implies that @xmath30 does not involve @xmath37 at all coming from the sources here .",
    "of course @xmath30 does involve @xmath37 , but these terms arise from fermion loops and are unrelated to the representation of the external sources .",
    "consequently they should not be replaced . ] and thus the replacement @xmath55 does not affect the coupling .",
    "it is worth presenting at least some details of the techniques used to compute the two - loop diagrams , first of all because they are helpful when trying to reproduce the results , but also because they might prove useful for other calculations as well .",
    "the remaining diagrams are best analyzed in momentum space , using the kinematics that follows from the wilson loop definition : the `` on - shell condition '' for the source reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the four - momentum carried by the source .",
    "thus the sources may have any three - momenta , the actual values of which are , however , unimportant , as the only quantity that appears is the momentum transfer @xmath58 .    by choosing a convenient gauge the number of graphs",
    "can be further reduced : if we employ feynman gauge , all diagrams with a three- or four gluon vertex with all gluons directly coupled to source lines vanish .",
    "this welcome feature is caused by the replacement of the dirac matrices @xmath59 in the source - gluon vertex by the simple factor @xmath60 , which means that all vertices are interchangeable as far as their lorentz structure and momentum dependence is concerned ( the momentum dependence is mentioned because it is the property which is destroyed by other gauges ) .",
    "the symmetry properties of both the three- and four gluon vertices then imply that the diagrams vanish .    consequently , apart from the ladders fig .",
    "[ fig : two]d  f , the two - loop gluon self - energy and double insertions of one - loop corrections , only a few of the two - loop vertex correction graphs and the six two - gluon exchange diagrams of fig .",

    "[ fig : rest]f has a vanishing colour factor for sources in the colour singlet state , and of the ladder diagrams only fig .",
    "[ fig : two]f is required , because the relation @xmath61 holds if the corresponding colour factors are neglected .",

    "@xmath95 with @xmath96 and where @xmath97 is the long - known one - loop result and @xmath98 is the new information added by the present analysis .",
    "note that the last term of @xmath99 could have been predicted from the one - loop result , it is exactly the contribution that would be dyson - summed in qed by introducing an effective coupling .",
    "the third term originates from the two - loop vacuum polarization and thus would also be included in the effective coupling in the case of qed .",
    "knowledge of @xmath99 now allows us to consistently use the three - loop expression for the running coupling in the @xmath100-scheme .",
    "an equation of the form ( [ vms ] ) can then be used to derive the @xmath0-function of one of the two couplings from the knowledge of the @xmath0-function of the second scheme .",
    "if we define @xmath0 and the coefficients @xmath101 in each scheme via @xmath102 we immediately find @xmath103 or @xmath104 and @xmath105 inserting the numbers one finds that the numerical value of @xmath106 is considerably larger than that of @xmath107 , which , for comparison , is given by the expression @xcite @xmath108    hence the coupling in the potential runs faster than the @xmath100-coupling .",
    "figure [ fig : ava ] compares the result for @xmath30 at the various loop - orders in graphical form , neglecting quark thresholds for simplicity : the dotted line represents the tree - level prediction , i.e.  a pure coulomb potential without a running coupling ; the dashed line shows the one - loop result in the sense that only the ( one - loop ) running of @xmath109 is taken into account , but the two couplings still coincide ( which means that it is still tree level as far as the diagrams contributing to the potential are concerned and should thus better be termed leading order ) ; the dashed - dotted line shows the next - to - leading order and the solid line the next - to - next - to - leading order results .",
    "it is evident that the two - loop contribution is nearly as important as the one - loop effect : the additional shift in @xmath30 caused by @xmath99 is roughly two third the size of the shift introduced by @xmath110 , and both corrections increase the coupling .",
    "the impact of this shift on the would - be toponium system , as an example , should be measurable : in the interval @xmath111gev including the nnlo - corrections amounts to a net increase of @xmath30 by about 5 to 7% .",
    "the charmonium and bottomonium systems on the other hand are mainly sensitive to momenta below 2gev and thus lie predominantly outside of the perturbative domain .    at this point",
    "we should mention that for simplicity we have chosen a fixed number of five light flavours to be valid over the whole range of momenta . for a more realistic study",
    ", the bottom and charm quark thresholds would , of course , have to be taken into account by matching effective theories with decreasing @xmath112 in order to restore decoupling .",
    "such a procedure would , however , leave our results qualitatively unchanged , it would mainly cause an even faster running of both couplings at low momenta .",
    "the plot just discussed was generated by employing ( [ vms ] ) as it stands , i.e.  by evolving the @xmath100-coupling , taken to equal @xmath113 at the @xmath114-mass , to the required scale ( assuming @xmath115 ) and then calculating @xmath30 at that scale . in principle",
    "the evolution can be performed in different ways : one may express the coupling in terms of the qcd scale parameter @xmath116 , or one may employ the qed - like formula @xmath117 although the two approaches are formally equivalent , in practice only the second one guarantees that the running coupling really coincides with its input value @xmath118 for @xmath119 . therefore the second approach has been adopted throughout this paper .",
    "one may argue that to first evolve the @xmath100-coupling and then determine the potential is not the best idea because , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : ava ] , the expansion parameter becomes large at low scales and thus the next terms of the perturbation series might also become important . an alternative would be to determine @xmath30 from ( [ vms ] ) at the @xmath114-mass and then evolve it to the scale @xmath120 .",
    "it turns out , not surprisingly , that the result is essentially the same , as can be seen from figure [ fig : rge ] where the running of the two couplings is compared : the solid line shows the three - loop running of @xmath30 and the dashed one @xmath109 , again for @xmath121 and five flavours ; the dotted line shows the corresponding result for @xmath30 for the hypothetical case @xmath122 as well , and thus really displays the different @xmath123functions .",
    "it exemplifies that the large numerical mismatch between the two couplings at low scales mainly arises from an amplification of the small mismatch at large scales .",
    "note that in a sense the two couplings are the same at the two - loop level as the @xmath0-functions then coincide and a difference merely arises because the evolutions start at different values .",
    "with the momentum - space representation of @xmath124 at our disposal , we are able to compute the real analogue of the coulomb potential , i.e.  the qcd potential in position space . in order to make the expressions simpler",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath125 for the fourier transform of a general power of @xmath126 . using a schwinger parameter , @xmath127 and a few relations between @xmath75-functions such as @xmath128 several equivalent representations of @xmath129",
    "can be derived , two of which will be useful in the following : @xmath130 where the first formula is applicable if @xmath131 , the second if @xmath132 and where @xmath133 denotes the euler - mascheroni constant .    adopting a strictly perturbative approach , we can use the original result leading to ( [ vq ] ) ( or in other words re - expand @xmath134 ) to find the potential in position space . from @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the renormalization scale ,",
    "we see that we need the fourier transform of @xmath137 which we easily obtain from @xmath129 because @xmath138\\bigg|_{u=0}\\ ] ] and thus @xmath139 hence the potential in position space becomes @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "one should note that going beyond the strictly perturbative approach is quite difficult and may lead to inconsistencies as the running coupling has a pole and thus the fourier transform of ( [ vq ] ) does not exist .",
    "but as the pole is an artifact which arises because a perturbative expression is extrapolated deep into the non - perturbative regime , it should not be taken too seriously .",
    "the result ( [ vr ] ) may be exploited in several ways : we certainly would not use it as it stands because of the possibly large logarithms , but choose a scale @xmath136 that reduces the higher order corrections .",
    "the first and in some sense natural choice is @xmath142 , leading to the curves displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvr ] where the effect of the loop - corrections on @xmath143 is shown , using the same input parameters as before . as the tree - level prediction would correspond to a constant in this plot",
    ", it has been omitted .",
    "the graph is essentially the same as figure [ fig : ava ] and therefore will not be discussed further .    a second choice motivated by noticing that due to ( [ fub ] ) , @xmath136 will always appear in combination with @xmath144 , is @xmath145 .",
    "this way we remove all terms involving @xmath133 form the coefficients . note that these terms are not small numerically because in @xmath22th order they involve @xmath146 for all @xmath147 as well as similar contributions from the other @xmath148 .    a third choice , which is frequently encountered in other contexts as well , would be to select @xmath136 in such a way as to remove the first - order coefficient completely , i.e.  @xmath149/r$ ] , which leads to @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",
    "this approach is in effect similar to defining an effective charge like in qed , but one should remember that it can not be interpreted as a dyson summation of the one - loop vacuum polarization and therefore there is no reason why it should constitute a superior choice . a real dyson summation would lead to problems with gauge invariance except for some part of the fermion loop contribution .",
    "yet another possibility , which is similar in spirit , would be to choose @xmath136 in such a way as to remove all @xmath112-dependence from the coefficients @xmath92 , i.e.  to use the blm scale setting prescription @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to @xmath152 with @xmath153    finally , a fifth choice follows from proceeding in analogy to momentum space and defining @xmath154 from ( [ vr ] ) one may calculate the @xmath0-function of the new coupling , with the result @xmath155 and , after determining the initial value for @xmath156 at @xmath157 form ( [ vr ] ) ( where there are again different choices for @xmath136 possible , we have used @xmath158 ) evolve it to the right distance .",
    "it is evident that the appearance of @xmath133 and the @xmath159-functions makes @xmath160 differ from @xmath30 , and consequently the same statements holds for the @xmath0-functions .",
    "the five approaches obviously result in different predictions for the three - loop potential  the difference formally being of the order @xmath161  as is explicitly demonstrated in figures [ fig : vschemes ] and [ fig : vschemesr ] .",
    "one should note that there is no a priori reason to prefer any choice of scale . the second choice",
    "@xmath162 might be an exception , as it consistently absorbs terms which only arise from the fourier transformation and are not directly related to the dynamics .",
    "it suggests that the distance complementary to @xmath163 is not @xmath164 but @xmath144 .",
    "but still `` non - dynamical '' terms @xmath165 remain even in this scheme .",
    "the blm - prescription , which requires more than a single scale , is also physically motivated , and the nice agreement between the two curves and the curve resulting from the renormalization group evolution ( labelled `` rge '' in the figures ) may serve as an argument in favour of these approaches .",
    "the coupling @xmath156 is already quite large at a distance @xmath166 0.5gev@xmath167 or 0.1fm , and its size is even strongly increased in the second and third approach due to a reduction of its scale implying that the non - perturbative regime starts at smaller separations . for five flavours for example",
    "we have @xmath168 and @xmath169 . as a consequence",
    "there is a large scheme - dependence of the potential in the region @xmath170fm . from figure",
    "[ fig : vschemesr ] we see that the situation is even worse as the perturbation series must break down near @xmath171fm because the potential starts to bend down there already .",
    "we thus should not trust the perturbative result for distances larger than about 0.08fm , which is consistent with the assumption that the perturbative potential should be reliable if @xmath172 is satisfied we find @xmath173mev .",
    "] @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether our result gives any indication on the onset of a linear rise of the potential , or in other words on the existence of confinement .",
    "unfortunately , the situation seems unclear in this respect .",
    "as figure [ fig : rvr ] proves , each new term of the perturbation series that is added makes the deviation from a pure coulomb prediction larger and the potential more attractive .",
    "but according to the conventional definition ( [ qcdv ] ) , a linearly _ rising _ potential requires a _ negative _ coupling , the perturbative curve for @xmath156 thus tends into the wrong direction , and there is no sign of a nontrivial zero of this function .",
    "the only indication on the existence of a zero is the breakdown of perturbation theory at distances of the order @xmath174fm ( or in other words the presence of the landau pole ) and the fact that , with increasing number of loops , this point appears at smaller and smaller distances . in some sense",
    "the gap between the perturbative and the linear part thus becomes broader .",
    "we have presented results of a full nnlo - calculation of the perturbative static potential in qcd both in momentum and position space , including a description of the technique employed , and we have argued that the respective couplings @xmath30 and @xmath156 are universal in the sense that they describe the potential for other infinitely heavy colour sources such as static gluinos as well .",
    "the @xmath0-functions corresponding to the two couplings have been derived .",
    "the main result is that the two - loop contribution is nearly as large as the one - loop term , both make the interaction more attractive , and that the perturbative potential seems to be reasonably reliable up to distances @xmath175 . for larger values a strong scale - dependence remains and the perturbation series even breaks down above about 0.1fm . although the results may be interpreted as an indication of a general tendency of higher loop corrections to strengthen the force between a quark - antiquark pair , to take them as a proof of confinement would be going too far .    starting from the results presented in this paper , it would be important to know , first , the impact of the two - loop contribution to the potential as a whole and , second , of the ambiguity due to different choices of scale on the energy levels and decay widths of quarkonia . the first point could be investigated in the toponium system as this is only sensitive to very short distances and does not suffer from the uncertainties arising from intermediate and large separations . the second point , however , would require the specification of some potential model for the latter region and thus the analysis would depend on additional parameters .",
    "nevertheless , a revised study of the type performed in @xcite would be very interesting .",
    "the author would like to thank prof .",
    "j. h. khn for carefully reading the manuscript and his continuous comments and advice , and prof .",
    "mannel for many interesting discussions .",
    "when trying to compute the two - loop integrals @xmath176 , it is convenient to combine gluon propagators using the standard formula for feynman parameters and to combine gluon and source propagators using the modified version @xmath177 with this technique the two momentum integrations can be performed one after the other , and after some rescalings of the @xmath26-parameters one is left with @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180^{d+1-\\sigma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] making the change of variables @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the two integrations corresponding to @xmath26 and @xmath0 can be done , with the result @xmath183 the presence of the @xmath184-function makes it impossible ( at least for the author ) to compute the remaining integral exactly for all values of @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "hence only the cases really needed and only the expansion in @xmath74 to the order required were treated .",
    "for @xmath187 this task is quite straightforward as @xmath188 is in fact finite in the limit @xmath189 and its expansion in @xmath74 can be computed without encountering any problems .",
    "but it should be noted that due to ( [ eq : i ] ) @xmath190 must be multiplied by @xmath191 to obtain @xmath83 and thus the latter integral is divergent .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the result quoted in section [ sec : tech ] has not been derived in the way just described , but by constructing an equation involving the integral .",
    "this method will be explained at the end of the appendix .",
    "the problem with the other two integrals @xmath190 is that they do not exist if we take @xmath192 and that it is difficult to factor out the divergence . as a first step in this direction",
    "the substitution @xmath193 can be applied to turn ( [ eq : it ] ) into @xmath194 with @xmath195 and where @xmath196 denotes the hypergeometric function .",
    "although this result may look quite impractical , it in fact helps : one factor @xmath191 has been factored out , and the expansion of the two hypergeomtric functions is also possible up to terms which are not needed anyhow .",
    "let us first examine @xmath197 : @xmath198",
    "thus we find @xmath199 where the residual function @xmath200 is well behaved for @xmath201 .",
    "a similar trick can be applied to @xmath202 if we first employ the relation @xcite @xmath203 which transforms @xmath202 into @xmath204 now @xmath205 by noting that @xmath206 and @xmath207 we can even improve the above expansion as @xmath208 must be of the form @xmath209 where @xmath210 vanishes for both @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "thus @xmath213      + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^3)k_2(t^2)\\ ] ] where @xmath214 vanishes at the origin and at infinity .    with these approximate formulae for the @xmath215 we can calculate the two missing integrals from ( [ ii ] ) up to terms of the order @xmath216 .",
    "the divergences still present can be extracted by writing @xmath217 where the function @xmath218 should be regular at the origin .",
    "the new integral is finite in the limit @xmath189 , and consequently may be expanded .",
    "one should note that in the case of @xmath219 there is a term @xmath220 in @xmath202 that removes the bad behaviour of the integrand at the origin , but introduces the same kind of divergence for large @xmath2",
    ". the trivial change of variables @xmath221 reduces this term to the above case again .",
    "it is essential that we treat the whole combination as of order @xmath222 : suppose , for example , we would expand @xmath220 , generating @xmath223 . inserted into ( [ ii ] ) and proceeding as described this would produce an integral of the form @xmath224 which is not of @xmath225 as we would assume , but of @xmath226 .",
    "the term also demonstrates that it is crucial to know that the omitted functions @xmath227 grow at most logarithmically after expansion in @xmath74 and thus do not invalidate our power - counting in this parameter .",
    "let us now come back to @xmath187 .",
    "starting from the original definition given in section [ sec : tech ] , shifting first @xmath228 , using @xmath78 and @xmath229\\ ] ] and then replacing @xmath230 in the first and shifting @xmath231 in the second term , one obtains : @xmath232.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence @xmath233 \\\\     & = & -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}i\\int\\!\\widetilde{dp}\\widetilde{dr}\\frac{\\delta(rv ) } {      ( -p^2)(-r^2)(-(r - p - q)^2)(pv+i\\varepsilon ) } \\\\     & = & \\frac{2\\pi}{3}i\\sqrt\\pi g(1,1;-1,-\\frac{1}{2})\\int\\!\\widetilde{dr }      \\frac{\\delta(rv)}{(-r^2)(-(r - q)^2)^{1/2+\\epsilon}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last expression we can replace @xmath234 by @xmath235 ( due to @xmath78 the principal value part of the resulting integral vanishes ) and use ( [ three : one ] ) again , or we can calculate the effective @xmath236-dimensional integral directly . via both routes we find the result given in section [ sec : tech ] .",
