    "it is clearly visible from his table 2 that majority of meteors were noted during july nights .",
    "almost all events observed in this month were classified as rapid .    during next years",

    "polish meteor publications were giving activity period between june 16th and july 31st .",
    "no clear maximum of activity was found ( kosinski 1990 ) .",

    "we presented here the results of visual and telescopic observations of @xmath0-cygnid stream made by cmw observers in years 19951997 .",
    "this stream is not included in the imo list of visual meteor showers ( rendtel et al 1995 ) due to the lack of photographic , video and radio data confirming its presence .",
    "the only continuous ( not visual ) surveys are the harvard super schmidt program of the 1952 - 54 period and the harvard radar project in the 1960 s .",
    "both have gaps in coverage due to weather or instrument irregularities .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath0-cygnids seem to fall in such gaps .",
    "mccrosky and posen ( 1961 ) presented the orbital elements of 2529 meteors photographed simultaneously from two camera stations of the harvard meteor project .",
    "the mean number of meteors captured in periods january  june and august  december is 221 events per month .",
    "the number of meteors photographed in july is only 102 .",
    "it is over two times smaller than in other months and certainly it is the reason of lacking the meteors from @xmath0-cygnid stream in that project .",
    "the similar situation occurred during the harvard radar project .",
    "however recent radio results obtained by michael boschat from dalhousie university in canada ( boschat 1998 ) showed clear enhancement of radio echoes in days 1998 july 19 - 20 .    analysis of 2748 paths of meteor events observed in july 1995 , 1996 and 1997 allowed us to obtain the basic properties of the stream .",
    "the geocentric velocity of the @xmath0-cygnid events is @xmath16  km / s and daily drift of the radiant @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the coordinates the center of the radiant of @xmath0-cygnid stream are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .            from visual observations made by cmw members in years",
    "19951997 we obtained the clear activity profile of the @xmath0-cygnid stream .",
    "meteors belonging to this shower were detected from june 30 to july 31 with clear maximum near july 18 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the maximal zhrs reached the level @xmath2 .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with results presented by jenniskens ( 1994 ) who obtained @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in spite of making many photographic exposures we still have no photographic confirmation of this stream . to confirm of disprove our results further visual , telescopic and particularly video and photographic observations are clearly needed .",
