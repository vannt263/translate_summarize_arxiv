    "<S> we study the decoherence of two coupled spins that interact with a spin - bath environment . it is shown that the connectivity and the coupling strength between the spins in the environment are of crucial importance for the decoherence of the central system . changing the connectivity or coupling strenghts changes the decoherence of the central system from gaussian to exponential decay law .    </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that decoherence by nuclear spins is the main obstacle for realization of quantum computations in magnetic systems ; see , e.g. , discussions of specific silicon @xcite and carbon @xcite based quantum computers . therefore , understanding the decoherence in quantum spin systems is a subject of numerous works ( for reviews , see refs  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the issue seems to be very complicated and despite many efforts , even some basic questions about character of the decoherence process are unsolved yet . due to the interactions with and between the spin of the bath , an analytical treatment can be carried out in very exceptional cases , even if the central systems contains one spin only . </S>",
    "<S> recent work suggests that the internal dynamics of the environment can be crucial to the decoherence of the central system  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present results of extensive simulation work of a two - spin system interacting with a spin - bath environment and show that the decoherence of the two - psin system can exhibit different behavior , depending on the characteristics of the coupling with the environment and of the internal dynamics of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a simple physical picture to understand this behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the behavior of an open quantum system crucially depends on the ratio of typical energy differences of the central system @xmath0 and the energy @xmath1 which characterizes the interaction of the central system with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath2 has been studied extensively in relation to the `` schrdinger cat '' problem and the physics is quite clear   @xcite : as a result of time evolution , the central system passes to one of the `` pointer states ''  @xcite which , in this case , are the eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 . the opposite case , @xmath4 is less well understood . </S>",
    "<S> there is a conjecture that in this case the pointer states should be eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath5 of the central system but this has been proven for a very simple model only  @xcite . on the other hand , this case is of primary interest if , say , the central system consists of electron spins whereas the environment are nuclear spins , for instance if one considers the possibility of quantum computation using molecular magnets  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a generic quantum spin model described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the central system and the hamiltonians of the environment and the interaction of the central system with the environment are given by @xmath8 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange integrals @xmath9 and @xmath10 determine the strength of the interaction between spins @xmath11 of the central system , and the spins @xmath12 in the environment , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange integrals @xmath13 control the interaction of the central system with its environment . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) , the sum over @xmath14 runs over the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 components of spin-@xmath18 operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the sequel </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the term heisenberg - like  @xmath21 ( @xmath3 ) to indicate that each @xmath22 ( @xmath13 ) is a uniform random number in the range @xmath23 $ ] ( @xmath24 $ ] ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 being free parameters . in earlier work  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we found that a heisenberg - like @xmath21 can induce close to perfect decoherence of the central system and therefore , we will focus on this case only .    </S>",
    "<S> the bath is further characterized by the number of environment spins @xmath27 with which a spin in the environment interacts . if @xmath28 , each spin in the environment interacts with the central system only . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 correspond to environments in which the spins are placed on a ring , square or triangular lattice , respectively and interact with nearest - neighbors only . if @xmath32 , each spin in the environment interacts with all the other spins in the environment and , to give this case a name , we will refer to this case as spin glass .    if the hamiltonian of the central system @xmath33 is a perturbation relative to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 , the pointer states are eigenstates of @xmath3  @xcite . in the opposite case , that is the regime latexmath:[$|\\delta    conjectured to be eigenstates of @xmath33  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are given by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation procedure is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we generate a random superposition @xmath41 of all the basis states of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this state corresponds to the equilibrium density matrix of the environment at infinite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - up  spin - down state ( @xmath42 ) is taken as the initial state of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the initial state of the whole system reads @xmath43 and is a product state of the state of the central system and the random state of the environment which , in general is a ( very complicated ) linear combination of the @xmath44 basis states of the environment . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath45 which , from earlier work  @xcite , is sufficiently large for the environment to behave as a largesystem . for a given , fixed set of model parameters , the time evolution of the whole system is obtained by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the many - body wave function @xmath46 , describing the central system plus the environment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it conserves the energy of the whole system to machine precision . </S>",
    "<S> we monitor the effects of the decoherence by computing the the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath47 of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> as explained earlier , in the regime of interest @xmath48 , the pointer states are expected to be the eigenstates of the central systems . </S>",
    "<S> hence we compute the matrix elements of the density matrix in the basis of eigenvectors of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the time dependence of quadratic entropy @xmath49 and the loschmidt echo @xmath50  @xcite , where @xmath51 is the density matrix for @xmath52 .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we show the time evolution of the elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath59 for different connectivity @xmath27 and @xmath60 , for the case that @xmath3 is an isotropic heisenberg model .    if @xmath61 , in agreement with earlier work  @xcite , we find that in the absence of interactions between the environment spins ( @xmath62 ) and after the initial decay , the central system exhibits long - time oscillations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a)(left ) ) . in this case and in the limit of a large environment , we have  @xcite @xmath63 \\cos \\omega t ,   \\label{melik}\\]]where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ melik ] ) clearly shows the two - step process , that is , after the initial gaussian decay of the amplitude of the oscillations , the oscillations revive and their amplitude levels of  @xcite . due to conservation laws , </S>",
    "<S> this behavior does not change if the environment consists of an isotropic heisenberg system ( @xmath67 for all @xmath14 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , independent of @xmath27 . if , as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we take @xmath70 $ ] random instead of the identical , the amplitude of the long - living oscillations is no longer constant but decays very slowly  @xcite .    if @xmath71 , the presence of heisenberg - like interactions between the spins of the environment has little effect on the initial gaussian decay of the central system , but it leads to a reduction and to a decay of the amplitude of the long - living oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the larger @xmath27 ( see fig .  [ fig1](b - e)(left ) ) or @xmath25 ( see fig .  [ fig2](a , c ) ) , the faster the decay is . </S>",
    "<S> note that for the sake of clarity , we have suppressed the fast oscillations by plotting instead of the real part , the absolute value of the matrix elements .    if @xmath72 , keeping @xmath27 fixed and increasing @xmath25 smoothly changes the initial decay from gaussian ( fast ) to exponential ( slow ) , and the long - living oscillations are completely suppressed ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b , d ) ) . for large @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> the simulation data fits very well to @xmath73with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .     except that @xmath3 is heisenberg - like and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    physically , the observed behavior can be understood as follows . if @xmath71 , a bath spin is affected by roughly the same amount by the motion of both the other bath spins and by the two central spins . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , each bath spin has enough freedom to follow the original dynamics , much as if there were no coupling between bath spins . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the initial gaussian decay is insensitive to the values of @xmath27 or @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> after the initial decay , the whole system is expected to reach an stationary state , but because of the presence of heisenberg - like interactions between the bath spins , a new stationary state of the bath is established , suppressing the long - living oscillations .    for increasing @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> the distance between two bath spins , defined as the minimum number of bonds connecting the two spins , becomes smaller . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for @xmath29 , this distance is @xmath78 , and for @xmath32 , it is zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for fixed @xmath25 and increasing @xmath27 the fluctuations in the spin bath can propagate faster and the evolution to the stationary state will be faster . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for fixed @xmath27 , increasing the coupling strength between the bath spins will speed up the dynamics of the bath , that is , the larger @xmath25 the faster will be the evolution to the stationary state .    in the opposite case @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 is a small perturbation relative to @xmath21 and the coupling between bath spins is the dominant factor in determining the dynamics of the bath spins . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by increasing @xmath27 or @xmath25 , the bath spin will have less freedom to follow the dynamics induced by the coupling to the two central spins , the influence of the bath on the central system will decrease , and the ( exponential ) decay will become slower .    according to the general picture of decoherence  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for an environment with nontrivial internal dynamics that initially is in a random superposition of all its eigenstates , we expect that the central system will evolve to a stable mixture of its eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the decoherence will cause all the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix to vanish with time . in the case of an isotropic heisenberg coupling between the central system and the environment , @xmath33 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath80 , </S>",
    "<S> hence the energy of the central system is a conserved quantity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the weight of the singlet @xmath81 in the mixed state should be a constant ( @xmath18 ) , and the weights of the degenerate eigenstates @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are expected to become the same ( @xmath85 ) . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b - e)(right ) , our simulations confirm that this picture is correct in all respects .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that although in the foregoing discussion we have compared @xmath86 to @xmath87 , this does not imply that @xmath86 can be used to fully characterize the decoherence process . in order to clarify the role of @xmath27 and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> , we change the coupling between the central system and the bath from heisenberg to heisenberg - like . from a comparison of the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , it is clear that the roles of @xmath27 and @xmath25 are the same in both cases , no matter whether the central - bath coupling is isotropic or anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are some differences in the decoherence process .    if @xmath88 , in the presence of anisotropic interactions between the central system and the environment spins , even in the absence of interactions between the bath spins , the second step of the oscillations decays and finally disappear as @xmath27 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the anisotropic interactions break the rotational symmetry of the coupling between central system and environment which is required for the long - living oscillations to persist .    if @xmath89 , @xmath90 can still be described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p23_exp ] ) , but now @xmath91 is no longer a linear function of @xmath25 . for an anisotropic @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the central system is no longer a conserved quantity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there will be energy transfer between the central system and the environment and the weight of each pointer state ( eigenstate ) in the final stable mixture need not be the same for all @xmath27 or @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> for a change , we illustrate this point by considering the quadratic entropy @xmath92 and loschmidt echo @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that these quantities will also dependent of the symmetry of the coupling between central system and the spin bath . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we present results for large @xmath25 and @xmath29 , confirming this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> for isotropic ( heisenberg ) @xmath3 and perfect decoherence ( zero off - diagonal terms in the reduced density matrix ) we expect that @xmath94=2/3 $ ] , in concert with the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ) . for heisenberg - like @xmath3 , @xmath95 will depend on the coupling strengths and as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) , we find that @xmath96 @xmath97 , corresponding to the case that all the diagonal elements in the reduced density matrix are the same ( @xmath98 ) and all other elements are zero .     and loschmidt echo @xmath93 of a central system ( with @xmath57 ) , interacting with a heisenberg - like environment @xmath21 ( with different @xmath25 ) via a heisenberg ( a , b , @xmath55 ) or heisenberg - like ( c , d , @xmath77 ) hamiltonian @xmath3 for the case @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the number next to each curve is the corresponding value of @xmath25.,width=321 ]    in conclusion , we have shown how a pure quantum state of the central spin system evolves into a mixed state , and that if the interaction between the central system and environment is much smaller than the coupling between the spins in the central system , the pointer states are the eigenstates of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> both these observations are in concert with the general picture of decoherence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have demonstrated that , in the case that the environment is a spin system , the details of this spin system are important for the decoherence of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have shown that changing the internal dynamics of the environment ( geometric structure or exchange couplings ) may change the decoherence of the central spin system from gaussian to exponential decay . </S>"
