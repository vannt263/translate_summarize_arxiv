    "the incredible experimental success of the renormalizable @xcite standard model @xcite , well beyond any theoretical expectation , puts severe constraints to any attempt to solve the hierarchy problem introducing new particles or states at the weak scale .",
    "all experiments confirm the standard model .",
    "it is true that all these experiments could have missed new light particles signals for some fortuitous coincidence or for some theoretical and still unknown reason , but we should not neglect the impressive convergence of all experiments towards the same conclusion : the spectrum and the properties of the low energy theory coincide with that of the renormalizable standard model .",
    "we stress the word renormalizable , because it is ruled out not only the real production of such new light particles but also their virtual exchange , that could appear under the form of new effective non renormalizable operators .",
    "limits to these operators can be found in the literature .",
    "they arise from precision electroweak data , from fcnc tests , but also from proton stability and neutrino masses . here",
    "we argue that this experimental scenario discloses a clue that can help us to guess how to extend the standard model .      with the ( renormalizable ) standard model hamiltonian , we are able to compute the scattering matrix for processes that involve different type of @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "all experimental tests prove the amazing accuracy of such predictions .",
    "in particular , experiments rule out the possibility to modify the renormalizable standard model hamiltonian either adding new light particles or introducing new higher dimensional operators with a characteristic scale @xmath2 ( according to the operator choice , @xmath3 can range from the tev scale , up to the grand unification scale ) . on the other hand",
    "the same hamiltonian is not able to give a realistic estimate of the effective potential , explaining the origin of the hierarchy between the weak scale and the unification scale .",
    "the mass parameter in the higgs potential is unstable under radiative corrections and it depends quadratically on the cut - off @xmath2 , the scale of the new physics . theories that introduces this cut - off close to the weak scale directly to the hamiltonian , do not explain why present experiments have not yet found evidence for departures from the standard model .",
    "theorists acknowledge the severe constraints to a relatively light new physics scale , and cope with them , assuming new symmetries that could reduce the impact of such light scale to the experimental tests , and getting used to the idea that a certain amount of fine tuning must be accepted .",
    "this scenario becomes less puzzling , if we look closer at the physical quantities that we are comparing .",
    "from one side we have very accurate predictions of the scattering matrix elements , between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states with is the higgs field . ]",
    "the average @xmath4 very close to @xmath5 , the electroweak vev .",
    "these matrix elements , and the time evolution of these states are very well described by the standard model .",
    "on the other hand , we know that the same standard model hamiltonian is unable to evaluate the energy of states with a very different vev @xmath6 ( i.e. the sm does not give an acceptable effective potential )",
    ". however this set of states is experimentally very different from the previous one , since a state with @xmath7 can not be reproduced in a laboratory . to our opinion",
    "these considerations raise a doubt : can we extrapolate ordinary quantum field theory to include the time evolution of these states , with very different vev , and very far from our experience ? in the following we will try to see if we can give a theoretical basis to this question .",
    "it is useful to exemplify the problem as follows : we show that a non linear schrdinger equation could explain an apparent paradox in a similar situation but in the simpler context of first quantization . to be concrete",
    "we take an explicit mathematical example .",
    "consider the following equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an analytic real function with @xmath10 , and @xmath9 going exponentially to zero when @xmath11 the solutions of this equation conserve the probability , and for any @xmath12 we have ( if  @xmath13 is normalized , at @xmath14 ) @xmath15 @xmath16this is simple to check once we observe that @xmath17 , and its time derivatives , are real for any @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 where we have used ( [ nonlinear ] ) .",
    "one can also verify that the energy @xmath20 with @xmath21 is conserved .",
    "one can study the class of solutions of this equation that satisfy @xmath22 in this approximation the ( [ nonlinear ] ) is an ordinary schrdinger equation with the potential of an harmonic oscillator ( and with bounded states ) provided that we replace @xmath23 on the other hand , since @xmath9 exponentially goes to zero when @xmath24 , we can also have solutions that are similar to a free gaussian wave packet , centered in @xmath25 and going to infinity when @xmath18 goes to infinity .",
    "this situation is similar to the puzzle that we have discussed in the previous section , where the experimental scenario apparently required two distinct hamiltonians with two different class of solutions : one with small vev and another one with very large vev .",
    "clearly a unique linear equation can not describe the evolution of the physical system in both physical regions , and only a non linear equation can correctly describe the time evolution in all regions . in the following",
    "we would like to see if this _ naive _ idea can be exploited to solve the hierarchy problem ( taking into account all necessary modifications required by the different physical context ) .",

    "this paradox becomes more affordable if we accept the possibility that the time evolution of the quantum states is described by a non - linear schrdinger equation .",
    "motivated by this example , we have explored how such a modification can be achieved still in the context of quantum mechanics , but with an embedding of second quantization into some sort of third quantization .",

    "namely , a new type of operators could appear in the effective hamiltonian of second quantization . beside the common self interaction of the operators @xmath225",
    ", one could also have some exotic operators of the form @xmath226 with the insertion of the vacuum projector .",
