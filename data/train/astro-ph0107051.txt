    "dynamical processes around supermassive black holes in quasars , blazars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are characterised by violent phenomena , leading to formation of jets and other outbursts .",
    "jet formation is usually connected with the processes in the magnetized accretion disks ( lovelace , 1976 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov , 1976 ) .",
    "formation of quasispherical outbursts , which are probably observed in quasars with broad absorption lines , could be connected with another mechanism . here",
    "we consider a possibility of a shell outburst from a supermassive black holes ( sbh ) surrounded by a dense massive stellar cluster , basing on a pure ballistic interaction of gravitating shells oscillating around sbh .",
    "ballistic ejection may be responsible for appearance of stars and observed sn in the intergalactic space , as well as the existence of stars between galaxies , suggested by many authors .",
    "investigation of spherical stellar clusters using shell approximation was started by hnon ( 1964 ) , and than have been successfully applied for investigation of the stability hnon ( 1973 ) , violent relaxation and collapse ( hnon 1964 ; gott 1975 ) , leading to formation af a stationary cluster .",
    "investigation of the evolution of spherical stellar cluster with account of different physical processes was done on the base of a shell model in the classical serie of papers of l. spitzer and his coauthors ( spitzer & hart 1971a , b ; spitzer & thuan 1972 ; spitzer & shapiro 1972 ; spitzer & chevalier 1973 ; spitzer & shull 1975a , b ; spitzer & mathiew 1980 ) .",
    "numerical calculations of a collapse of stellar clusters in a shell approximation ( yangurazova & bisnovatyi - kogan 1984 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & yangurazova 1987,1988 ) had shown , that even if all shells are initially gravitationally bound , after a number of intersections some shells obtain sufficient energy to become unbound , and to be thrown to the infinity . in the newtonian gravity",
    "the remnant is formed as a stationary stellar cluster , and in general relativity sbh may be formed as a remnant .",
    "formation of outbursts due to the ballistic interactions may happen as a result of intersection of shells , oscillating around sbh . in the smooth cluster with or without sbh in the centre stars",
    "evaporate , due to stellar encounters mainly with small kinetic energy , and formation of rapidly expelling stars is about 100 times less probable due to predominance of gravitational encounters with small momentum transfer ambartsumian ( 1938 ) .",
    "if the cluster is strongly aggregated , consisting of few compact pieces , the encounters between these pieces are quite different , collision with large momentum transfer are becoming probable . in this case gravitational interaction between compact pieces",
    "may lead to the outburst with large velocity , and when such event happens in the vicinity of sbh the velocity could become a considerable part of the light velocity @xmath1 .    such kind of situation in principle may be produced as a result of galactic collisions with close encounter of nuclei , when one of the nuclei strips the matter from the companion in the form of a collapsing shells .",
    "interaction of such shell with the stellar cluster may lead not only to collapse into sbh , but also to the reverse phenomena : expelling of the shell with a speed , much larger than the average speed of stars in the cluster .",
    "the shell is not falling into sbh due to high angular momentum of its stars .",
    "even more important example of a quasi - spherical mass ejection is a relativistic collapse of a spherical stellar system , which is considered ( zeldovich & podurets , 1965 ; lightman & shapiro 1978 ; ipser 1980 ; rasio et al . 1989 ) as the main mechanism of a formation of supermassive black holes in the galactic centers .",
    "approximation of such collapse by consideration of spherical shells is the simplest approach , which reflects all important features of such collapse ( gott 1975 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & yangurazova 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "our consideration is related to the motion of stars ( shells ) which remain outside the newly formed supermassive black hole .",
    "here we consider a simplified problem of a motion of two massive spherical shells , each consisting of stars with the same specific angular momentum and energies , around sbh .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an elementary treatment of the ballistic ejection , and to estimate the maximal efficiency of this ejection .",
    "note , that in a more complicated case of numerous shell intersection this elementary act is a key process of the energy exchange between stars and of matter ejection .",
    "this is also the elementary process leading to the violent relaxation of the cluster lynden - bell ( 1967 ) , studied in the shell approximation by gott ( 1975 ) and yangurazova & bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1984 ) .",
    "chaotization of the motion of two gravitating intersecting shells appears as a by - prodiuct of our consideration .",
    "the appearence of chaos in such a system , which is described by a set of simple algebraic equations , is a rare example . for the oversimplified case with a pure radial motion and reflecting inner boundary",
    "the chaotic shell motion was found by miller and youngkins ( 1997 ) .",
    "here we consider realistic shells consisting of stars moving along eliptical trajectories , and their chaotic properties would be examined in more details in another work .",
    "we find conditions at which one of two shells is expelling to infinity taking energy from another shell .",
    "we find a maximum of the velocity of the outbursting shell as a function of the ratio of its mass @xmath2 to the mass @xmath3 of sbh using only newtonian theory of the shell s motion .",
    "however we introduce cutoff fixing the minimal radius of the potentially outbursting shell @xmath4 on the level of few @xmath5 .",
    "we show , that for equal masses of two shells the expelling velocity reach the value @xmath6 at @xmath7 , and @xmath8 was obtained at the masses of shells @xmath9 , where the parabolic velocity of a shell in the point of a smallest distance to the black hole @xmath10 may be of a considerable part of @xmath1 .    in sections 2,3",
    "we describe outburst effect and in sections 4 we present the evidence of the chaos in the system of intersecting shells .",
    "the exact solution of these problems in the context of general relativity will be presented in the subsequent paper .",
    "physically the nature of the ballistic ejection is based on the following four subsequent events .",
    "the outer shell is accellerated moving to the center in a strong gravitational field of a central body and inner shell .",
    "somewhere near the inner minimal radius of the trajectory shells intersect .",
    "after that the former outer shell is deccellerating moving from the center in the weaker gravitationsl field of only one central body .",
    "the second intersection happens somwhere far from the center .",
    "that may result in the situation when the total energy ( negative ) of the initially gravitationally bound outer shell is becoming positive as a result of two subsequent intersections with another shell .",
    "the quantitive analysis of this procrss is done in this section .",
    "equation of motion of a shell with mass @xmath2 and total conserved energy @xmath11 in the field of a central body with mass @xmath3 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radial velocity of the shell and @xmath14 is the total kinetic energy of tangential motions of all particles , the shell make - up from .",
    "the constant @xmath15 has that interpretation that @xmath16 is the sum of the absolute values of the angular momenta of all particles.the term @xmath17 in ( [ r1 ] ) is due to the self - gravity of the shell .    let s consider two shells with parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 moving around sbh with mass @xmath3 . let the shell `` 1 '' be initially outer and the shell `` 2 '' be the inner one",
    ". then equations of motion are : @xmath20 @xmath21 by the index ( 0 ) we mark the initial evolution stage before the first intersection of the shells .",
    "assume that both shells are moving to the center and @xmath22 .",
    "such shells intersect each other at a some radius @xmath23 and at some time @xmath24 after wich the shell `` 1 '' becomes inner and shell `` 2 ''  outer .",
    "the equations of motion of the shells during this new stage ( designate it by the index ( 1 ) ) are : @xmath25 @xmath26 the crucial point now are the matching conditions at the intersection point @xmath27 where from one can obtain the initial data to the equations ( [ r4 ] ) , ( [ r5 ] ) in order to define uniquely the evolution during this new stage . in newtonian theory",
    "these conditions are : @xmath28 @xmath29 i.e. the conservation of the total energy of the system and continuity of the velocities through the intersection point . expressing @xmath30 from eqs .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , ( [ r3 ] ) and @xmath31 from eqs .",
    "( [ r4 ] ) , ( [ r5 ] ) and equating them following conditions ( [ r6 ] ) we get : @xmath32 at some point @xmath33 can happen the second intersection after which the shell `` 1 '' again becomes the outer and shell `` 2 '' becomes inner one .",
    "it is a simple task to write the equation of motion during this third stage ( we designate it by the index ( 2 ) ) and repeat the same procedure of matching velocities but now at point @xmath33 .",
    "the result is : @xmath34 @xmath35 let us describe the situation , when one shell is ejected to infinity after intersection of to initially bound shells .",
    "we consider a case when",
    "@xmath36 is larger then @xmath37 so , that the second term in ( [ r8 ] ) has larger absolute value , then the first one , the first shell gains a positive energy and goes to infinity .",
    "both shells have initial negative energies @xmath38 and @xmath39 , but with small enough absolute values .",
    "the first shell takes the energy from the second one , which is becoming more bound with larger absolute value of the negative energy @xmath40 , according to ( [ r8 ] ) .",
    "let s illustrate the foregoing scenario by an exact particular example of two shells of equal masses .",
    "we choose parameters in the following way : @xmath41 in fact such exact solution represents the first approximation to the more general situation when @xmath42 and @xmath39 are nonzero ( negative ) but small in that sense that both modulus @xmath43 and @xmath44 are much less than @xmath45 .",
    "we assume that initially both shells are moving towards the center .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , ( [ r3 ] ) that under condition ( [ r10 ] ) such shells will intersect inescapably at the point @xmath46 . after the second intersection at @xmath33",
    "the shell `` 1 '' will be thrown to infinity with expelling velocity @xmath47 .",
    "it follows from ( [ r8 ] ) that @xmath48 in order to construct a solution with maximal possible @xmath47 we consider a case when initially inner shell `` 2 '' reaches the inner turning point at minimal possible radius @xmath49 ( see introduction ) , and intersects with the initially outer shell after , during its outward motion .    to find the second intersection point we need to solve equation of motion ( [ r4]),([r5 ] ) for shell s trajectories after the first intersection .",
    "first , let us consider the bound shell `` 2 '' . we apply",
    "( [ r3 ] ) to the point @xmath49 which gives ( see fig . 1 . ) @xmath50    substituting this expression for @xmath51 into ( [ r5 ] ) and taking into account ( [ r7 ] ) , ( [ r10 ] ) we get a solution of the equation ( [ r5 ] ) in the following parametric form : @xmath52 where the constants @xmath53 and @xmath54 are : @xmath55 on the choice of the constant @xmath56 see below .    between the first and second intersection there",
    "exists the inner turning point of the shell `` 1 '' ( now inner shell ) .",
    "we take that additional restriction that the shell `` 1 '' reaches this turning point also at the minimal possible radius @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to show that a wide class of solutions with such restriction really exists . at the point @xmath49 equation ( [ r4 ] )",
    "gives : @xmath57 we substitute this expression for @xmath58 into eq .",
    "( [ r4 ] ) and again with conditions ( [ r7 ] ) and ( [ r10 ] ) obtain the following parametric form of the solution of this equation : @xmath59 where the constant @xmath60 and @xmath61 are : @xmath62 the first intersection point @xmath46 corresponds to some parameters @xmath63 . at this point the time @xmath64 calculated from ( [ nr13 ] )",
    "should coincide with time @xmath65 calculated from ( [ nr16 ] ) .",
    "this fix the constant @xmath56 : @xmath66 also the values of @xmath67 from ( [ nr13 ] ) and @xmath68 from ( [ nr16 ] ) should be the same and equal to @xmath37 . from this",
    "follows parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 @xmath72 the second intersection point @xmath73 corresponds to parameters @xmath74 .",
    "the application of the analogous coincidence conditions to the equations ( [ nr13 ] ) and ( [ nr16 ] ) at this second point gives : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 from ( [ nr14]),([nr17 ] ) and ( [ nr19])-([nr23 ] ) it is easy to see that all these relations determine @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we introduce now the `` parabolic '' velocity @xmath10 of the any outer shell at the point of its minimal distance to the center @xmath49 as : @xmath81 than we have @xmath82 consequently this ratio is also a function of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we find numerically the value of @xmath79 maximizing the ratio @xmath83 which value is a function of @xmath80 only .",
    "dependencies for @xmath83 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 as functions of the parameter @xmath80 for these maximizing solutions are given in fig .",
    "2 - 4 .    the numerical calculations ( illustrated by the fig .",
    "2 ) shows that the runaway velocity @xmath47 reaches its maximal possible value at @xmath84 and it is @xmath85 .",
    "if we consider the shells around sbh then the minimal radius @xmath86 of the shell `` 1 '' orbit can not be less then the two gravitational radiuses @xmath87 . in the extreme case when @xmath88 we have @xmath89 and for the maximal possible runaway velocity in the family of solutions , characterized by ( [ r14 ] ) , ( [ nr15 ] ) we get @xmath90 .",
    "the first evidence that the motion of two intersecting shells can show chaotic character was given by b.n .",
    "miller & v.p .",
    "youngkins ( 1997 ) .",
    "they investigated the special case when the central body is absent and particles consisting the shells are moving only in radial direction ( in our notation @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "this situation , however , can not model astrophysical cluster with massive nuclei , and also the problem of the influence of central newtonian singularity arise which need some additional care . in any case",
    "a study of more physically realistic models with nonzero @xmath93 and @xmath94 from the point of view of possible chaotic behaviour represents essential interest .",
    "we report here some results for such more general two shells model which was investigated in the previous sections but again for the shells with equal masses .",
    "we consider now only oscillatory regime of motion without any runaway effects .",
    "the shell motion in the newton gravitational field is completely regular , but at presence of intersections the picture changes qualitatively .",
    "the shell intersections result to chaos in their motions .",
    "character of chaos depends , mainly , on mass ratio of a shell and a central body . at a small shell mass",
    "the motion of the shells occurs basically in the field of the central body , and after one intersection there is a little change in a trajectory of each shell .",
    "consider a case when angular momentum parameters @xmath95 and energies of shells are close to each other , and as a result of two intersections energy is transferred to the shell `` 1 '' . since",
    "shell parameters changes are not large , the mutual positions and speeds of shells after intersections do not change strongly . then at the next intersection the part of energy will again be transferred to the shell `` 1 '' . after a large number of intersections ,",
    "however , the mutual positions changes essentially . then the energy starts to flow to the shell `` 2 '' , consequently we observe beating in oscillation of shells . in the case",
    "when the masses of the intersecting shells are large enough , the energy is transferred very intensively between them .",
    "it changes trajectories of shells essentially so that the next intersection does not resemble at all the previous one . in this case",
    "a shell s motion at once gets properties of a randomness .",
    "shell oscillations with mass ratio @xmath96 are presented in fig.5 . in the case of massive shells",
    "the exchange of energy between shells occurs more intensively . as a result",
    "we have the obviously expressed chaotic behaviour of shells .",
    "chaotic shell oscillations with @xmath97 are presented in fig.6 . in fig.6 a full randomness of behaviour of the shells",
    "is seen obviously .",
    "let us note , that when the exchange of energy between shells is sufficiently large the strong randomness appears .",
    "shells may exchange their positions during the motion .",
    "the external shell may become inner one and vice versa .",
    "one of the shells may give up practically all its energy of the orbital motion , which it may loose at constant angular momentum , i.e. the orbits of its particles become almost circular .",
    "it may be seen in figs.6,7 at those moments when the orbit of the inner shell fills a narrow band by itself .",
    "let us note that in our calculations the motion of the shells is very sensitive to initial parameters , what gives an additional evidence that intersecting shells represent a really chaotic system .",
    "when we change only precision of integrator from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , after several intersection motion of shells becomes absolutely different from its initial behaviour in fig.6 at the same initial conditions .",
    "if we change the angular momentum parameter of one of shell from 1.40 to 1.41 , then in the same way as in previous case , motion of shells becomes absolutely different after several intersection .",
    "we can make statement that the behaviour of shells is unstable and is strongly affected by any perturbation in initial parameters of shell motion .",
    "the example of a chaotic behaviour of two intersecting selfgraviting shells , moving in their own gravitational field , without a central mass , is represented in fig .",
    "chaotic behaviour of the intersecting selfgravitating shells in the newton gravity is a rare example of a chaotic dynamical system , described fully analytically by algebraic relations .",
    "we have shown that pure gravitational interaction of two spherical shells and central object may lead to considerable energy exchange and ejection of one of the shell with a subrelativistic speed @xmath100 .",
    "motion of stars around sbh may lead to similar effects due to their interaction , and we may expect formation of very rapidly moving stars , which could overcome the galactic gravity and runaway into the intergalactic space . in this way very extended galactic halo may be formed . ballistic mechanism of energy exchange between gravitating particles",
    "may be important in the evolution of spatial distribution of cold dark matter , when gravitational instabilities are developing in masses , much less than galactic ones , and gravitationally bound massive objects , consisting mainly from the dark matter interacting only due to its gravitation , may be formed .",
    "interesting examples of ballistic interaction of satellites with planets and stars , their acceleration and ballistic control are presented in the book of v.v .",
