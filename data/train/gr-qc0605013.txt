    "scalar field in a black hole backgound is a subject of active investigation @xcite , yet the massive scalar field has been investigated only in very few studies as to its quasinormal spectrum @xcite,@xcite , late - time behavior @xcite and scattaring properties @xcite .",
    "behavior of the massive scalar field in a black hole background is quite different from that of the massless one in many aspects : first , it demonstrates the so - called superradiant instability @xcite , which is absent for massless fields .",
    "this super - radiant regime happens provided the real oscillation frequency satisfies the inequality @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the azimutal number of the mode , and @xmath3 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "another research , indicating the instability of massive scalars was that by detweiler @xcite where slowly growing instability was suggested for values @xmath4 , i.e. in the regime , when particle compton wavelength is much larger then the size of the black hole ( @xmath5 is the mass of the scalar field ) .",
    "second , it may cause existence of infinitely long - living modes called quasi - resonances @xcite .",
    "finally , at asymptotically late times the massive fields show universal behavior independent on spin of the field @xcite .",
    "note , that scalar field with the mass term can be also interpreted as a self - interacting scalar field within regime of small perturbations @xcite .",
    "one more recent application of dynamic of the massive scalar field in a black hole backgound comes from different brane - world theories where massless fields can be considered as effectively massive fields on the brane .",
    "yet , the strongest motivation to make an extensive search for quasinormal modes of massive scalar field is that until now the stability for massive scalar field perturbations in the kerr background is not studied under non - super - radiant ( quasinormal ) boundary conditions .",
    "usually , stability of spherically symmetric black holes , like schwarzschild or reissner - nordrstrom ones , can be relatively easily proved by using positivity of the conserved energy . on the contrary to the schwarzschild case ,",
    "kerr black holes have negative energy density inside the ergo - sphere .",
    "therefore , fields can grow in parts of the space - time , leading to instability . the only result on stability of massive scalar field in kerr space - time",
    ", we are aware of , is that of beyer @xcite , where it was proved that the modes of field with the mass obeying the inequality @xmath6 are stable .",
    "note , that the inequality found by beyer is not compatible with conditions for super - radiance , so it does not contradict super - radiant instability of massive fields .",
    "in addition ,",
    "the above inequality does not mean that fields of lower mass are unstable , and beyer suggested the ways to lower the inequality @xcite .",
    "if such an instability exists one could find an accurate threshold value of field mass @xmath5 when the instability begins .",
    "this could be done by an extensive computing of the quasinormal modes and by finding of the growing ones .",
    "some low laying wkb quasinormal modes were found by simone and will @xcite , yet neither fundamental modes ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 is multi - pole number ) , nor modes with @xmath9 can be found with trustable accuracy by wkb approach @xcite , even despite very good accuracy of wkb method for low overtones @xcite .",
    "therefore , being limited by wkb accuracy , one can not judge about stability and high damping asymptotic in this case .",
    "recently the quasinormal damping and late time regimes in time domain were investigated by l. burko and g. khanna in @xcite , and no instability was observed in the considered range of values of field mass @xmath5 @xcite .    because of the above reasons , in this paper we used the accurate frobenius method to make an extensive search for quasinormal modes of the massive scalar field around kerr black holes .",
    "the paper organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii introduces the main formulas for the wave equations and the frobenius procedure .",
    "iii gives numerical data for found quasinormal modes , and sec .",
    "iv discusses the obtained results and the possibility for ( un)stability .",
    "the background metric in the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 has the form : @xmath14 where , @xmath3 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the massive scalar field obeys the equation : @xmath17 the radial wave equation ( @xmath18 ) is well - known : @xmath19 where @xmath20    the separation constant @xmath21 satisfies the equation @xmath22 and can be found numerically for any given @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath24 can be obtained numerically , we are able to solve the equation for the radial part ( [ radialeq ] ) , using the continued fraction method @xcite . in order to satisfy the quasinormal mode boundary conditions , which corresponds to purely in - going waves at the event horizon and purely outgoing waves at spatial infinity , we require that @xmath25 where @xmath26 marks the event horizon : @xmath27 and @xmath28 the sign for @xmath29 should be chosen in order to remain in the same complex quadrant as @xmath23 .",
    "the equation ( [ radialeq ] ) has three singularity points : the spatial infinity ( @xmath30 ) , the event horizon ( @xmath31 ) and the internal horizon ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "thefore the appropriate frobenius series has the form : @xmath33    and the coefficients satisfy the three - term recurrence relation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be found in analytical form .",
    "we do not present them here because they have rather combersome form .    by comparing the ratio of the series coefficients @xmath38we obtain an equation with a convergent _ infinite continued fraction _ on its right side : @xmath39that can be solved numerically by minimizing the absolute value of the difference between its left and right sides .",
    "the equation ( [ continued_fraction ] ) has infinite number of roots , but the most stable root depends on @xmath40 .",
    "generally the larger number @xmath40 corresponds to the larger imaginary part of the root @xmath23 .",
    "note , that the case under consideration allows to use the nollert procedure @xcite , in order to improve convergence of the infinite continued fraction , that is useful for searching roots with a very large imaginary part .",
    "since we are limited by kaluza - klein equation , we do not take into consideration the effect of the mass of the scalar field onto the black hole .",
    "thereby , we can consider only small values of mass of the field @xmath5 , in comparison with the mass of the black hole @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 . yet , as large values of @xmath5 are possible in brane - world theories , we shall touch this case as well .",
    "the quasinormal modes of the kerr black hole depend on several parameters : the multi - pole number @xmath8 , the overtone number @xmath40 , the azumutal number @xmath2 , and on the black hole and scalar field parameters : @xmath3 , @xmath41 , @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath2 can take values @xmath42 . from here and on we measured @xmath5 and @xmath41 in units of black hole mass @xmath3 .",
    "let us look at tables i - iii : the damping rate determined by the imaginary part of the @xmath23 is decreasing considerably with increasing of mass @xmath5 . while the real oscillation frequency is slightly increased with grwoing of @xmath5 .",
    "this happens also for schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "note , that it is the fundamental mode @xmath43 that contributes mainly into the ringing signal .    to check the correctness of the applied procedure we considered particular cases of massless scalar field in the kerr background and of the massive field in the schwarzschild background .",
    "for these two cases the quasinormal modes are well - known for example from the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can see , for instance in the table iii that qnms in case of @xmath44 , coincide with corresponding data in of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also data in tables i - iv for @xmath45 coincide with modes found in @xcite .",

    "for the case of schwarzschild black hole , we proved in @xcite , both analytically and numerically , that this tendency of qn modes to diminsh difference stipulated by mass @xmath5 , ends with a universal high damping asymptotic , which is independent on the mass of the field",
    ". thus , the massive term @xmath5 does not contribute to high overtone behavior of schwarzschild black holes .",
    "we shall show numerically that the same is true for kerr black holes .",
    "indeed , from table ii , one can see that already for relatively small overtone number , the difference between quasinormal modes with different values of mass @xmath5 becomes negligible .",

    "larger @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) leads to considerable decreasing of the damping rate and finally to the same infinitely long living modes ( i.e. modes with infinitesimaly small imaginary part ) found in @xcite for schwarzschild black holes and called _ quasi - resonances_. therefore , when increasing @xmath5 , the strict line in fig .",
    "3 does not have continuation into negative half - plane .",
    "we see here that , the larger mass of the field @xmath5 is , the more low laying modes will change into quasi - resonances .",
    "meanwhile , the rest of the spectra consists of ordinary modes ( i.e. modes with finite time of damping ) .",
    "moreover , at sufficiently high overtone number , the difference between massive and massless case will be neglected ( see table ii ) .",
    "this behavior mimics the qn behavior of non - rotating black holes . yet ,",

    "to exclude possible instability we should search for qnms for different values of @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "as one can see from representative plots fig . 1 , at large @xmath8 the imaginary part of the qn frequencies remains bounded and , thereby , does not show any tendency to instability .",
    "the dependence of the real osicillation frequency on the azimutal number @xmath2 can be found on fig .",
    "3 .    after careful investigating of region of small values @xmath49 , we conlcude that there are _ no unstable modes_. as to the case of intermediate @xmath49 , our extensive search of quasinormal modes implies that there are no unstable modes at least as far as @xmath49 is not much larger then @xmath50 .",
    "we certainly can not find quasinormal modes for any large value of @xmath5 .",
    "this happens because the numerical procedure used here requires slow changing of @xmath5 , when searching for new modes , in order not to jump occassionaly into another overtone .",
