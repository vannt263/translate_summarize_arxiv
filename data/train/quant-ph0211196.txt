    "the problem of the quantum dynamics of a small system interacting with its environment has been extensively studied since the origin of quantum mechanics . however , in spite of the noticeable progresses in the theory of open quantum systems , many conceptual difficulties still remain . indeed",
    "the understanding of the effects of the environment on the physical system of interest , in general , is not an easy task .",
    "the conventional way to afford the problem of the description of the time evolution of an open quantum system consists in eliminating the degrees of freedom of the environment in order to derive an equation of motion for the reduced density matrix of the small system .",
    "this procedure stems from the fact that we are usually only interested in the dynamics of this subsystem and do not really care about the state of the environment and its evolution .",
    "the procedure of tracing over the environmental variables thus amounts at declaring that everything other than the small system is indifferent to us . in this way one reduces the number of variables one needs to take into account to study the problem .",
    "only very few physical systems prove to be amenable to an analytic description of their open dynamics . in this paper",
    "we deal with the simplest open quantum system worth being studied : the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "such a system is of great conceptual importance because it provides a simple , successful starting point in the theoretical description of many experimental situations in the quantum optics , solid state physics and quantum field theory contexts . for this reason it is also one of the most extensively studied physical systems @xcite .",
    "understanding the dissipative behaviour of open quantum systems is a crucial problem for both fundamental and applicative reasons . on one hand , indeed , during the last few years , the interpretation of zurek , associating the quantum to classical transition with environment induced decoherence effects , has become increasingly popular . from this point of view , studying the open system dynamics of exemplary quantum systems , i.e. harmonic oscillator , would help in identifying the elusive border between quantum and classical descriptions of the world . on the other hand ,",
    "the huge advances in experimental techniques for controlling the evolution of quantum systems have paved the way to the realization of the first quantum logic gates , the key elements of quantum computers .",
    "the biggest obstacle to building quantum computers is the decoherence process due to the unavoidable coupling with the external environment .",
    "thus , studying a decohering quantum computer is an essential step for the identification of realistic quantum error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "a standard method to describe the effects of the environment on a small quantum system is based on the born - markov master equation .",
    "such an approach is valid whenever the environmental correlation time is much shorter than the typical time scales of the system dynamics . under these conditions",
    ", it is possible to derive and , in some cases , to solve analytically the master equation ruling the dynamics .",
    "this is for example the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled through bilinear interactions to a reservoir of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this model is a particular case of the quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) , where we specify the system to be just a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "there exist situations , however , wherein the reservoir correlation time is longer than the system time scales of interest and thus the born ",
    "markov approximation does not hold anymore .",
    "this is for instance the case of atoms decaying in photonic band gap materials or atom lasers @xcite .",
    "moreover , very recently , the potential interest of non  markovian reservoirs for quantum information processing has been demonstrated @xcite and a non ",
    "markovian description of quantum computing , showing the limits of the markovian approach , has been presented @xcite .",
    "several procedures have been developed to treat non  markovian processes .",
    "most of them are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "very often , in order to describe the dynamics of an open quantum system in terms of a master equation for its density matrix , a number of approximations involving the relevant system and reservoir parameters are required .",
    "one of the most common is the weak coupling approximation based on the assumption of a weak system - environment coupling strength .",
    "as underlined by paz and zurek in @xcite , a perturbative approach in the coupling strength can always be shown to lead to master equations local in time .",
    "this fact could appear surprising at a first sight since often non ",
    "markovian quantum systems are described by generalized master equations involving a non  local memory kernel taking into account the past history of the reduced system .",
    "the advantage of dealing with a generalized master equation which is local in time is that the memory effects of the environment are incorporated in its time dependent coefficients @xcite .",
    "this circumstance makes it possible , in some cases , to find an analytic solution of the generalized master equation .    in this paper",
    "we present an original method for the derivation of the operatorial density matrix solution of the non  markovian master equation for qbm in the weak coupling limit .",
    "we apply our procedure to the case in which the system is a harmonic oscillator interacting with the quantized reservoir through a bilinear coupling .",
    "our method does not rely on any assumption other than the weak coupling limit .",
    "in particular it is independent of the type of environment considered and on the characteristic parameters of the system , provided a perturbative approach to the second order in the coupling constant is valid .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness and simplicity of our analytic solution discussing , as an example , the dissipative dynamics of the mean energy of the harmonic oscillator .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the mathematical formalism of superoperators and we present some key properties for solving the generalized master equation for our system . in section iii",
    "we describe the non  markovian master equation for qbm in the weak coupling limit and in section iv we derive its operatorial solution . in section v we discuss some approximated forms of the density matrix and we present some applications . finally in section",
    "vi we present conclusions .",
    "let us begin introducing the mathematical formalism and properties which we use in the rest of the paper to derive the time dependence of density matrix of the system under scrutiny .",
    "our method is based on the extension of the notion of eigensolution of an operator in the _",
    "_ superoperator__formalism .",

    "once determined these quantities it is possible to describe the dynamics evaluating the action of the corresponding temporal evolution operator on the initial state .",
    "the dynamics of open systems , however , is much more complicated since the description of the state of the system in terms of a state vector is not sufficient anymore . in order to describe completely the physical system",
    "one needs indeed to introduce the density matrix operator whose time evolution is governed by a master equation definitely more difficult to handle than the schrdinger equation .    in this section",
    "we present a new method to solve the generalized master equation , given by eq .",

    "in some sense , the method we describe can be seen as a generalization to open systems of the procedure for solving the schrdinger equation of a closed system , since it is based on the solution of an appropriate eigenvalue equation .",
    "indeed we will deal , in the formalism of superoperator , with generalized eigenvalue equations involving superoperators and operators , instead of operators and vectors respectively . as we will see in this section ,",
    "the existence of some useful algebraic properties of the superoperators will help us in treating the problem of the open system dynamics allowing , in particular , to find the operatorial solution for the density matrix of the system .",

    "such a master equation has been derived in @xcite by using a superoperatorial technique and in @xcite by means of the time convolutionless method and is the weak coupling approximated form of the exact master equation for qbm derived by paz and zurek in @xcite .",

    "finally it is worth noting that from the qcf it is easy to derive the wigner function characterizing the state of the dissipative system .",
    "concluding , we believe that , the non  markovian analytic approach we have derived in this paper for qbm can be generalized to other fundamental dissipative systems , such as for example the jaynes  cummings model with losses . as for the qbm , we think that the analytic solution of the density matrix may be used for studying new aspects of such a basic model , both for fundamental and for applicative research , under conditions in which , up to now , only numerical approaches were possible .",
