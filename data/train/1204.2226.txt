    "the gravitational interaction among galaxies , most of which are supposed to host a supermassive black hole ( bh ) , with @xmath3  @xcite , is a well - established observational fact  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a few documented astrophysical cases , strong indications exist to believe that a binary merger among supermassive bhs has occurred or is ongoing  @xcite .",
    "a strong motivation for studying supermassive binary black holes ( smbbhs ) comes from the fact that their gravitational signal will be detected by the planned laser interferometric space antenna ( elisa / ngo ;  @xcite ) . when combined to the usual electromagnetic ( em ) emission",
    ", the detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) from these systems will provide a new tool for testing a number of fundamental astrophysical issues  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , smbbhs are currently attracting a widespread interest , both from an observational and a theoretical point of view  @xcite . according to the simplest picture that has gradually emerged through a series of semi - analytical studies and numerical simulations  @xcite , the accretion disk formed around the two merging bhs , commonly referred to as the `` circumbinary '' accretion disk ,",
    "can follow the dynamical evolution of the system up until the dynamical timescale for the emission of gws , which scales like @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the separation of the binary , becomes shorter than the viscous timescale , which instead scales like @xmath6 .",
    "when this happens , the circumbinary accretion disk is essentially decoupled from the binary , which rapidly enters the final stages of the inspiral . under these conditions , neglecting the inertia of the accreting fluid can be regarded as a very good approximation .",
    "in contrast , magnetic fields generated by the circumbinary accretion disk could play an important role and the dynamics of the plasma in the inner region can then be described within the _ force - free _ ( ff ) approximation .",
    "these physical conditions are indeed similar to those considered in the seminal investigations of bh electrodynamics of blandford and znajek  @xcite , who addressed the question of whether the rotational energy of an isolated bh can be extracted efficiently by a magnetic field . after the first two - dimensional investigations of komissarov and barkov  @xcite",
    ", the numerical study of bh magnetospheres has now entered a mature phase in the context of smbbhs evolution .    in an extensive analysis , but still in the absence of currents and charges , i.e.  , in electrovacuum ,  @xcite showed that , even though the em radiation in the lowest @xmath7 and @xmath8 multipole reflects the gravitational one , the energy emitted in em waves is @xmath9 orders of magnitude smaller than that emitted in gws for a reference binary with mass @xmath10 and a magnetic field @xmath11 g , thus casting serious doubts about a direct detection of the two different signals .",
    "however , a series of more recent numerical simulations in which currents and charges are taken into account , have suggested the intriguing possibility that a mechanism similar to the original one proposed by blandford and znajek may be activated in the case of binaries  @xcite ; note that @xcite also make use of a ff approximation . in particular , the blandford ",
    "znajek mechanism is likely to be valid under rather general conditions , namely even if stationarity and axisymmetry are relaxed and even if a non - spinning bh is simply boosted through a uniform magnetic field .",
    "moreover , for such uniform magnetic field , the emitted em flux shows a high degree of collimation , making the em counterpart more easily detectable .",
    "a less optimistic view has emerged recently in  @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , where we have shown , through independent calculations in which the em emission was extracted at much larger radii , that the _ dual - jet _ structure is indeed present but energetically subdominant with respect to the non - collimated and predominantly quadrupolar emission .",
    "in particular , even if the total luminosity at merger is @xmath0 times larger than in  @xcite , the energy flux is only @xmath12 times larger near the jets , thus yielding a collimated luminosity that is @xmath0 times smaller than the total one . as a result , paper i indicated that the detection of the dual jets at the merger is difficult if not unlikely .    here",
    "we provide additional information on the results presented in paper i and discuss the details of our implementation of the equations in which the ff condition is obtained via a damping scheme which drives the solution to satisfy the correct condition .",
    "we show that this is important for a correct and accurate description of the current sheets that can develop in the course of the simulation .",
    "we also study in greater detail the three - dimensional charge distribution produced as a consequence of the inspiral and show that during the inspiral it has a complex structure tracing the motion of the two bhs .",
    "finally , we provide quantitative estimates of the scaling of the em emission with frequency , with the diffused part having a dependence that is the same as the gw one and that scales as @xmath13 , while the collimated one scales as @xmath2 , thus with a steeper dependence than previously estimated by  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ evolutionequations ]",
    "we describe the system of equations considered in our analysis , with particular emphasis on the treatment of the ff condition , while in section  [ sec : analysis_of_radiated_quantities ] we discuss the different routes to the calculation of the em radiated quantities . in section  [ sec : initial_models ] we present the astrophysical setup of a bh binary merger , while section  [ sec : affe ] compares different approaches for the enforcement of the ff condition .",
    "section  [ bbhmergers ] is devoted to the presentation of the results , and , in particular , to the computation of the luminosity .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains the conclusion of our work and the prospects for the detection of an em counterpart to smbbhs .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we set @xmath14 , adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices with greek indices running from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 , and make use of the lorentz - heaviside notation for the em quantities , in which all @xmath15 factors disappear .",
    "we solve the combined system defined by the einstein and maxwell equations and model either an isolated rotating bh or a bh binary inspiralling in quasi - circular orbits . in both cases",
    "we assume that there is an external ff magnetic field .",
    "more specifically , we solve the einstein equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the ricci , the metric , and the stress - energy tensors , respectively .",
    "in addition , we solve the following extended set of maxwell equations  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the faraday tensor , @xmath22 is its dual , @xmath23 is the four - current , and we have introduced a 3 + 1 slicing of spacetime , with @xmath24 being the unit ( future oriented ) timelike vector associated with a generic normal observer to the spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "the set of maxwell equations   and   is referred to as `` extended '' because it incorporates the so - called _ divergence - cleaning _",
    "approach , originally presented in  @xcite in flat spacetime , and which amounts to introducing two additional scalar fields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , that propagate away the deviations of the divergences of the electric and of the magnetic fields from the values prescribed by maxwell equations .",
    "such scalar fields are initialized to zero , but are driven into evolution as soon as violations of the em constraints are produced .",
    "the total stress - energy tensor is composed of a term corresponding to the em field : @xmath27 and of a term due to matter , @xmath28 .",
    "however , because the em field is assumed to be ff , @xmath29 , and the total stress - energy tensor is then assumed to be given entirely by equation  , namely @xmath30 . in the rest of our discussion",
    "we will use the expression `` electrovacuum '' to denote the case when currents and charges of the maxwell equations are zero .",
    "such a scenario was extensively studied in  @xcite and it will be used here as an important reference . in what follows we discuss in more detail our strategy for the solution of the einstein equations and of the maxwell system in an ff regime .      for the solution of the einstein equations we make use of a three - dimensional finite - differencing code that adopts a conformal - traceless `` @xmath31 '' bssnok formulation of the equations ( see  @xcite for the full expressions in vacuum and  @xcite for the case of a spacetime with matter ) .",
    "the code is based on the ` cactus ` computational toolkit  @xcite and employs adaptive mesh - refinement techniques via the ` carpet`-driver  @xcite . for compactness we will not report here the details regarding the adopted formulation of the einstein equations and the gauge conditions used , which can however be found in  @xcite .",
    "we also note that recent developments , such as the use of eighth - order finite - difference operators or the adoption of a multiblock structure to extend the size of the wave zone , have been recently presented in  @xcite . here , however , in order to limit the computational costs and because a very high accuracy in the waveforms is not needed , the multiblock structure was not used and we have used a fourth - order finite - difference operator with a third - order implicit - explicit runge  kutta ( rkimex ) integration in time ( see section  [ sec : ntofffc ] ) .      the maxwell equations   and take a more familiar form when expressed in terms of the standard electric and magnetic fields as defined by the following decomposition of the faraday tensor in a 3 + 1 foliation : @xmath32 where the vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 are purely spatial ( i.e.  , @xmath35 ) and correspond to the electric and magnetic fields measured by the normal ( eulerian ) observers .",
    "the two extra scalar fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 introduced in the extended set of maxwell equations lead to two evolution equations for the em constraints , which , we recall , are given by the divergence equations @xmath36 where the electric current has been decomposed in the electric charge density @xmath37 and the spatial current @xmath38 .",
    "more specifically , these evolution equations describe damped wave equations and have the effect of controlling dynamically the possible growth of the violations of the constraints and of propagating them away from the problematic regions of the computational domain where they are produced .    in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the @xmath31 formulation of equations ( [ maxwell1a ] ) and ( [ maxwell1b ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the lie derivative along the shift vector @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the charge density @xmath44 can be computed either through the evolution equation   or by inverting the constraint equation  . for simplicity , we choose the latter approach , which ensures that the constraint   is automatically satisfied if @xmath45 initially and effectively removes the need for the potential @xmath25 .",
    "exploiting now that the covariant derivative in the second term of equations ( [ maxwellext_3 + 1_eq1a ] ) and ( [ maxwellext_3 + 1_eq1b ] ) reduces to a partial derivative , i.e.  , @xmath46 and using a standard conformal decomposition of the spatial 3-metric @xmath47 we obtain the final expressions for the extended maxwell equations that we actually evolve    @xmath48   = \\alpha\\ , k\\ , e^i - \\alpha\\ , j^{i}\\ , ,   \\\\ \\label{maxwellext_3 + 1_p_eq1a }   & & \\hskip -0.5 cm { \\cal d}_t \\ , b^{i }   +     \\epsilon^{ijk}\\ , e^{4\\phi}\\ , [ \\,(\\partial_j\\ , \\alpha\\,)\\ , \\tilde\\gamma_{ck}\\ , e^c\\ ,       + \\alpha\\,(\\,4\\,\\tilde\\gamma_{ck}\\,\\,\\partial_j\\,\\phi\\,+\\,\\partial_j\\,\\tilde\\gamma_{ck}\\,)\\,e^c     + \\alpha\\,\\tilde\\gamma_{ck}\\,\\partial_j\\,e^c\\ , ] +      \\alpha\\,e^{-4\\phi}\\,\\tilde\\gamma^{ij}\\,\\nabla_j\\,\\phi   = \\alpha\\ , k\\ , b^i\\ , ,   \\\\ \\label{maxwellext_3 + 1_p_eq1b }    & & \\hskip -0.5 cm { \\cal d}_t \\,\\phi + \\alpha\\ , \\nabla_i b^i =     -\\alpha \\kappa\\ , \\phi \\ , .",
    "\\label{maxwellext_3 + 1_p_eq1d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    clearly , the standard maxwell equations in a curved background are recovered for @xmath49 , so that the @xmath26 scalar can then be considered as the normal - time integral of the standard divergence constraint  , which propagates at the speed of light and is damped during the evolution .    as mentioned above",
    ", the coupling of the einstein to the maxwell equations takes place via the inclusion of a nonzero stress - energy tensor for the em fields which is built in terms of the faraday tensor as dictated by equation  .",
    "more specifically , the relevant components of the stress - energy tensor can be obtained in terms of the electric and magnetic fields , that is as @xmath50\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the scalar function @xmath53 can be identified with the energy density of the em field , while the energy flux @xmath54 is the poynting vector .    as already discussed in the introduction",
    ", we remark again that the em energies that will be considered here are so small when compared with the gravitational binding ones that the contributions of the stress - energy tensor to the right - hand - side of the einstein equations   are effectively negligible and thus can be set to zero , reducing the computational costs .",
    "the fully coupled set of the einstein - maxwell equations was considered in  @xcite and the comparison with the results obtained here suggests that for the fields below @xmath55 g , the use of the test - field approximation is fully justified .",
    "as commented before , within an ff approximation the stress - energy tensor is dominated by the em part and the contribution coming from the matter can be considered zero . following  @xcite , the conservation of energy and momentum , @xmath56",
    ", implies that also the lorentz force is negligible , i.e.  , @xmath57 which can also be written equivalently in terms of quantities measured by eulerian observers as @xmath58 computing the scalar and vector product of the equations above with the magnetic field @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 the first relation   implies that the electric and magnetic fields are orthogonal , while expression   defines the current , whose component parallel to the magnetic field , namely @xmath61 , needs to be defined via a suitable ohm law . from the numerical point of view , specific strategies must be adopted in order to enforce the ff constraints expressed by equations   and .",
    "in fact , even though such constraints are exactly satisfied at time @xmath62 , there is no guarantee that they will remain so during the evolution of the system .",
    "the approach introduced by  @xcite to enforce the constraints   and consists in a modification of the system at the discrete level , by redefining the electric field after each timestep in order to remove any component parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "in other words , after each timestep the newly computed electric field is `` cleaned '' by imposing the following transformation  @xcite @xmath63 in addition , the current is computed from equation   after setting @xmath64 .",
    "an alternative approach , introduced in  @xcite and then in  @xcite , uses the maxwell equations to compute @xmath65 , which has to vanish according to equation  . using equations   and it is then easy to obtain the following prescription for @xmath66 : @xmath67\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without further modifications",
    ", however , this approach leads to large violations of the ff constraint   in long - term numerical simulations , as it does not provide a mechanism for imposing the constraint at later times .    as we will show later on , both approaches   and   are not fully satisfactory and , as a consequence",
    ", we here present an alternative method , which takes inspiration from the treatment of currents ( and related stiff source terms ) in resistive magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the idea of introducing a suitable ohm law was proposed in  @xcite and then in  @xcite , but it has not been used so far in numerical simulations , due to the presence of stiff terms which appear as a result . in practice , our continuum approach is equivalent to the insertion of suitable _ driver _ terms , so that the parallel component @xmath66 is computed from an ohm law of the type @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the anisotropic conductivity along the magnetic - field lines .",
    "this additional term in the current acts like a damping term in the evolution @xmath70 , and enforces the constraint   on a timescale @xmath71 . for @xmath69",
    "sufficiently large , one can ensure that the ff constraint   is always satisfied . in the simulations presented in this paper , we choose @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the timestep on the finest refinement level .",
    "the resulting hyperbolic system with stiff terms is solved using a third - order rkimex time integration method with the technical implementation following the one discussed in  @xcite and with additional details presented in the appendix .",
    "an additional problem in the numerical treatment of the ff approach is represented by the development of current sheets , namely of regions where the electric field becomes larger than the magnetic field , such that the condition @xmath74 is violated .",
    "if this happens , and in the absence of a proper ohm law responsible for the resistive effects , the alfvn wave speed becomes complex and the system of ff equations is no longer hyperbolic  @xcite . under realistic conditions ,",
    "one expects that in these regions an anomalous and isotropic resistivity would restore the dominance of the magnetic field .",
    "a solution to this problem was proposed in  @xcite , where the velocity of the drift current was modified in order to ensure that it is always smaller than the speed of light .",
    "this leads to the following prescription for the current : @xmath75 which should be compared with equation   and has the net result of underestimating the value of the current .",
    "an alternative solution to the numerical treatment of current sheets consists in a modification of the system again at the discrete level  @xcite . in practice",
    ", after each timestep a correction is applied `` by hand '' to the magnitude of the electric field in order to keep it smaller than the magnetic field , i.e.  , @xmath76\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 when @xmath78 and @xmath79 otherwise .",
    "our strategy , however , differs from both the previous ones and follows the same philosophy behind the choice of the driver defined by equation  .",
    "we therefore introduce a second _ driver _ in ohm law , which will act as a damping term for the electric field in those cases when @xmath80 .",
    "this additional term , combined with the prescription for the parallel part of the current , leads to the following effective ohm law : @xmath81 expression   shows therefore that in normal conditions , i.e.  , when @xmath82 , the last term introduces a very small and negative current along the direction of the electric field .",
    "however , should a violation of the condition   take place , a positive current is introduced , which reduces the strength of the electric field and restores the magnetic dominance .",
    "in section  [ sec : affe ] we will compare the different prescriptions for the enforcement of the ff condition and show that , in contrast to recipes   and  , our suggestions   and   yield both and accurate and a smooth distribution of the em currents .",
    "the calculation of the em and gravitational radiation generated during the inspiral , merger and ringdown is an important aspect of this work as it allows us to measure the amount correlation between the two forms of radiation .",
    "we compute the gravitational radiation via the newman - penrose curvature scalars . in practice , we define an orthonormal basis in the three - dimensional space @xmath83 , with poles along @xmath84 . using the normal to the slice as timelike vector @xmath85 , we construct the null orthonormal tetrad @xmath86 : @xmath87 with the bar indicating a complex conjugate . adopting this tetrad",
    ", we project the weyl curvature tensor @xmath88 to obtain @xmath89 , that measures , ideally at null infinity , the outgoing gravitational radiation . for the em emission ,",
    "on the other hand , we use two equivalent approaches to cross - validate our measures .",
    "the first one uses the newman - penrose scalars @xmath90 ( for the ingoing em radiation ) and @xmath91 ( for the outgoing em radiation ) , defined using the same tetrad  @xcite : @xmath92 by construction , the newman - penrose scalars @xmath93 are dependent on the null tetrad  , so that truly unambiguous scalars are measured only at very large distances from the sources , where inertial observers provide preferred choices .",
    "any measure of these quantities in the strong - field region is therefore subject to ambiguity and risks to produce misleading results . as an example",
    ", the em energy flux does not show the expected @xmath94 scaling when @xmath91 and @xmath90 are measured at distances of @xmath95 , as used in  @xcite , which is instead reached only for @xmath96 . as we will show in section  [ bbhmergers ] , this fact is responsible for significant differences in the estimates of the non - collimated em emission .",
    "the use of a uniform magnetic field within the computational domain has a number of drawbacks , most notably , nonzero initial values of @xmath97 . as a result",
    ", great care has to be taken when measuring the em radiation .",
    "fortunately , we can exploit the linearity in the maxwell equations to distinguish the genuine emission induced by the presence of the bh(s ) from the background one .",
    "following  @xcite , we compute the total em luminosity as a surface integral across a 2-sphere at a large distance : @xmath98 which results straightforwardly from the integration of the component of em stress - energy tensor ( [ stress - em ] ) along the timelike vector @xmath24 and the normal direction to the large 2-sphere ( namely , the flux of the poynting vector in equation ( [ tmunu_decomposition2 ] ) through the 2-sphere ) . the term @xmath90 in equation   has been maintained ( it disappears at null infinity ) to account for the possible presence of an ingoing component in the radiation at finite distances .",
    "in particular , equation   shows that the net flux is obtained by adding ( with the appropriate sign ) the respective contributions of the outgoing and ingoing fluxes .",
    "more specifically , in terms of the complex scalars @xmath91 and @xmath90 , the outgoing net flux is obtained by subtracting the square of their respective moduli . in the specific scenario considered here , where a nonzero non - radiative component of the magnetic field extends to large distances , expression   must be modified .",
    "more specifically we rewrite it as @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the values of the background scalars induced by the asymptotically uniform magnetic - field solution in the time - dependent spacetime produced by the binary bhs . under assumption of a vanishing net ingoing radiation ,",
    "i.e.  , @xmath102 and of stationarity of the background field , i.e.  , @xmath103 , expression ( [ fem_jlmt0 ] ) can also be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath104 although equation ( [ eq : cp ] ) does not represent , at least in a strict physical and mathematical sense , a valid expression for the emission of em radiation in generic scenarios , it can provide a useful recipe whenever the assumed approximations made above are actually fulfilled . in section  [ bbhmergers ]",
    "we will assess to what degree this is the case for the specific scenario and model considered here .",
    "the choice of the background values of the newman - penrose scalars @xmath100 and @xmath101 plays a crucial role in measuring correctly the radiative em emission , since these quantities are themselves timedependent and can not be distinguished , at least a priori , from the purely radiative contributions .",
    "this introduces an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath100 and @xmath105 , which can however be addressed in at least two different ways .",
    "the first one consists in assuming that the background values are given by the initial values , and further neglecting their time dependence , namely setting @xmath106 since all the @xmath107 multipoles of the newman - penrose scalars are not radiative , a second way to resolve the ambiguity is to remove those multipole components from the estimates of the scalars , namely , of defining @xmath108 where @xmath109 refer to the @xmath107 modes of the multipolar decomposition of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is sufficient to capture most of the background ) .",
    "note also that because the @xmath107 background is essentially time independent ( after the initial transient ) , the choice   is effectively equivalent to the assumption that the background is given by the final values of the newman - penrose scalars as computed in an electrovacuum evolution of the same binary system .",
    "while apparently different , expressions   and   lead to very similar estimates ( see section  [ backgroundsubtraction ] ) and , more importantly , they have a simple interpretation in terms of the corresponding measures that they allow .    the second approach that we have followed for the computation of the emitted luminosity",
    "is the evaluation of the flux of the poynting vector across a 2-sphere at large distances in terms of the more familiar 3 + 1 fields @xmath112 and @xmath59 in equation  ( [ tmunu_decomposition2 ] ) . of course",
    ", also such evaluation is adequate only far from the binary .",
    "the purpose of implementing both versions of the luminosity calculation , that are conceptually equivalent but differ in the technical details , is precisely to quantify the error introduced by evaluating the flux at large but finite distances via the newman - penrose scalars @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "also in this case , to account for the background non - radiative contribution due to our choice of uniform magnetic field ( and using again the linearity in the maxwell equations ) , we need to remove the background values of the em fields @xmath113 .",
    "the relevant part of the poynting vector is then computed as @xmath114 where , consistently with expression  , we set @xmath115    as we will show in sections  [ luminositymeasures ] and [ backgroundsubtraction ] , we have verified that the measures of the em luminosity obtained using equation   or equation   reproduces well the corresponding ones obtained using the poynting vector in equation  .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the astrophysical scenario we have in mind is represented by the merger of supermassive bh binaries resulting from galaxy mergers . more specifically , we consider the astrophysical conditions during and after the merger of two supermassive bhs , each of which is surrounded by an accretion disk . as the merger between the two galaxies takes place and",
    "the bhs get closer , a single `` circumbinary '' accretion disk is expected to form , reaching a stationary accretion phase . during this phase ,",
    "the binary evolves on the dynamical viscous timescale @xmath116 of the circumbinary accretion disk , which is regulated by the ability of the disk to transport its angular momentum outward ( either via shear viscosity or magnetically mediated instabilities ) . on a much longer radiation - reaction timescale @xmath117 , the system looses both energy and angular momentum through the emission of gws , hence progressively reducing the binary separation @xmath5 . as a consequence , for most of the evolution",
    "the disk slowly follows the binary as its orbit shrinks .",
    "however , because @xmath117 and @xmath116 have a very different scaling with @xmath5 , more specifically @xmath118 while @xmath119 , at a certain time the timescale @xmath120 becomes smaller than @xmath121 .",
    "when this happens , the disk becomes disconnected from the binary , the mass accretion rate reduces substantially and the binary performs its final orbits in an `` interior '' region which is essentially devoid of gas  @xcite .",
    "this represents the astrophysical scenario in which our simple model is then built .",
    "although poor in gas , the inner region is coupled to the circumbinary disk via a large - scale magnetic field , which we assume to be anchored to the disk .",
    "the inner edge of the disk is at a distance of @xmath122 and is effectively outside of our computational domain , while the binary separation is only of @xmath123 . for simplicity , and because a large - scale dipolar field will appear as essentially uniform on the orbital lenght scale of the binary during the final stages of the inspiral , we use an initially uniform magnetic within the computational domain .",
    "more specifically , the initial magnetic field has cartesian components given simply by @xmath124 with @xmath125 in geometric units or @xmath126 g for a binary with total mass @xmath10 .. ] furthermore , because we consider the initial conditions to represent a tenuous plasma electrically neutral , the charges , electric currents , and the initial electric field are all assumed to be zero , i.e.  , @xmath127 .",
    "we note that although reasonable , the assumption of a large - scale uniform magnetic field has a deep impact on the results obtained and more realistic magnetic - field topologies will be considered in our future work .",
    "as mentioned earlier , although astrophysically large , the initial magnetic field considered here has an associated em energy which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational - field energy and can be are treated as a test field . on the other hand ,",
    "the combination of very low densities and strong magnetic fields makes the ff approximation rather appropriate for capturing the dynamics of the tenuous plasma .",
    "we construct consistent bh initial data via the `` puncture '' method as described in  @xcite .",
    "we consider binaries with equal masses but with two different spin configurations : namely , the @xmath128 binary , in which both bhs are non - spinning , and the @xmath129 binary , in which both bhs have spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we use these two configurations to best isolate the effects due to the binary orbital motion from those related to the spins of the two bhs .",
    "we note that similar initial data were considered by  @xcite but we have recalculated them here using both a higher resolution and improved initial orbital parameters .",
    "more specifically , we use post - newtonian ( pn ) evolutions following the scheme outlined in  @xcite , which provides a straightforward prescription for initial - data parameters with small initial eccentricity , and which can be interpreted as part of the process of matching our numerical calculations to the inspiral described by the pn approximations .",
    "the free parameters of the puncture initial data are then : ( 1 ) the puncture coordinate locations , ( 2 ) the puncture bare mass parameters , ( 3 ) the linear momenta , and ( 4 ) the individual spins .",
    "the parameters of the models adopted in the numerical simulations can be found in  @xcite . in brief , the initial separation is @xmath130 for all of them , where @xmath131 is the total initial bh mass , due to the binding energy of the bhs . ] chosen as @xmath132 , while the individual asymptotic initial bh masses are @xmath133 .",
    "in addition , the em field is initialized to @xmath124 with @xmath134 g and @xmath135 .",
    "the numerical grids consist of nine levels of mesh refinement , with a fine - grid resolution of @xmath136 .",
    "the wave - zone grid , in which our wave extraction is carried out , has a resolution of @xmath137 , and extends from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "finally , the outer ( coarsest ) grid extends up to a distance of @xmath140 in each coordinate direction .",
    "shorter , higher - resolution simulations have also been carried out to perform consistency checks . finally , in addition to bhs in a binary system",
    ", we have also considered spinning and non - spinning isolated bhs as testbeds for our implementation of the ff condition . in this case",

    "the important advantage of the discretized approach introduced by  @xcite is that , at least globally , it gives the desired result of an ff solution .",
    "in fact , since this approach acts `` by hand '' on the em fields and converts them to values which would yield an ff regime , one is guaranteed that the constraints  , , and are satisfied .",
    "however , a potential disadvantage of such approach is also that there is no guarantee that the solution that is forced locally with the transformations   is compatible with the solutions in their neighborhoods and thus , that it leads to a smooth and accurate representation of the em fields in the presence of current sheets . as we will show below",
    ", this concern is indeed well grounded , but it can be resolved effectively through the `` driver '' approach proposed here .    to compare the different ff prescriptions we have considered the simpler setup of a single spinning bh as this allows us to concentrate on stationary solutions and hence to isolate the potential drawbacks of the different prescriptions , which in a binary would otherwise be confused with the actual dynamics of the em fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : ffbh ] reports the time evolution of the 2-norms of the scalar product @xmath144 , i.e.  , @xmath145 ( left column ) and of the fractional 2-norm of @xmath146 , i.e.  , @xmath147 , in particular , refers to a single spinning bh , while the bottom row has been obtained in the case of the non - spinning bh binary @xmath128 .",
    "the different curves correspond to the various combinations in the specification of the current and in the treatment of the ff constraints .",
    "in particular , the labels in the legend of figure  [ fig : ffbh ] refer to the following choices :    * @xmath148 : denotes the first step of the `` discrete '' approach of  @xcite , which amounts to adopting equation   with @xmath64 for the current and to equation   for ensuring the ff constraint  . *",
    "@xmath149 : denotes the first step of our `` driver '' approach and which amounts to adopting equation   with the parallel component of the current specified by equation  .",

    ", the bump of @xmath153 at @xmath154 simply corresponds to the time of the merger and the constraint decreases after that .",
    "similarly , the right column of figure  [ fig : ffbh ] shows that all prescriptions are also able to enforce to comparable precision the current - sheet condition of equation  , but also that the discrete recipe   is slightly less effective in the case of an inspiralling binary ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the main conclusion to draw from figure  [ fig : ffbh ] is that , at least _ globally _ , all methods provide a comparable and actually very good enforcement of the ff conditions .",
    "their _ local _ performance , however , is rather different and this is shown in figure  [ fig : current2d ] , which reports the electrical currents as computed for a representative configuration of a single spinning bh with dimensionless spin @xmath155 . in the top panels",
    "we have reported the current vectors in the plane @xmath156 , while in the bottom ones the currents in the plane @xmath157 .",
    "the two columns , on the other hand , contrast the currents when computed using the @xmath148 and @xmath150 approaches ( left column ) or when computed using our @xmath149 and @xmath151 approaches ( right column ) .",
    "a rapid comparison is sufficient to highlight that although both approaches yield an ff condition , the solution is very different , particularly on small scales . more specifically , when the combination of methods @xmath149@xmath151 is adopted ( right column ) , strong meridional currents are clearly visible and form a jet - like structure , with negative currents in the central parts of the jet and positive ones on the edges of the jet .",
    "this current distribution is what is expected and it resembles the typical structure of the ff magnetosphere of a rotating bh obtained through the solution of the grad - shafranov equation ( see , for instance , figure  7 in  @xcite ) . on the other hand , the corresponding currents when the prescriptions @xmath148 and @xmath150 are used ( right column ) do not show evident signs of descending currents and , rather",
    ", they show unphysical features around the bh and discontinuities along the @xmath158 diagonals when seen in the @xmath159 plane .",
    "in addition , the currents tend to be predominantly contained in planes which are parallel to the @xmath160 plane ( see the top row ) and thus do not show the circulations which are instead captured with our drivers approach .",
    "overall , the comparison presented in figure  [ fig : current2d ] confirms our suspicions that , while providing a solution which is globally ff , the prescriptions @xmath148 and @xmath150 are not guaranteed to yield solutions that are locally accurate and can actually lead to solutions with large discontinuities .",
    "for these reasons we believe that our approaches @xmath149@xmath151 should be preferred in treatments of ff electrodynamics . as a final remark",
    "we also note that our prescriptions   and   also provide a ( small ) saving in computational costs .",
    "since we use an algebraic prescription for the current which automatically drives the solution to the ff regime , we do not need to perform the expensive checks at every gridpoint that come with the approach suggested in  @xcite .",
    "after having discussed the details of our implementation of the ff conditions and having shown its higher accuracy with respect to alternative suggestions in the literature , in what follows we concentrate our discussion on the ff electrodynamics accompanying the inspiral and merger of bh binaries .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the subtleties which emerge with the subtraction of the background radiation , the spatial distribution of the charge density , the em and gw zones , and the scaling of the em luminosity with frequency .      as anticipated in section  [ sec : analysis_of_radiated_quantities ] , our measure of em radiation is influenced by the choice of a uniform initial magnetic field within the computational domain , which leads to nonzero initial values for @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "hence , a proper identification of this background radiation is essential for the correct measure of the emitted luminosity and to characterize its properties .",
    "0.5 cm     the generic expression   for the em luminosity can be evaluated in combination with equation  , that is , by setting as background values those of the newman - penrose scalars @xmath110 and @xmath161 at the initial time .",
    "note that initial values of these scalars are the same they have in an electrovacuum scenario ( they are indeed the same considered in  @xcite ) , and thus the `` background subtraction '' corresponds in this case to the subtraction of the em emission coming from a magnetic field which is asymptotically uniform . of course , the initial time is as good as any other time and we could in principle choose @xmath100 and @xmath101 at any time @xmath162 . in this case , however , we would have to deal with the additional complication that for any choice other than @xmath62 , the background radiation will also have an azimuthal modulation as a result of the orbital motion and hence it will not be simply an @xmath107 background .    the angular distribution of the emitted radiation when projected onto a 2-sphere , in fact , shows the presence of two jets but also of two extended lobes , which rotate at the same frequency of the binary and that provide the bulk of the em emission ( see figure  1 of paper i ) . as a result",
    ", any background subtraction at @xmath163 will also have an @xmath164 component which will interfere with the @xmath164 evolution of the emitted flux , introducing a modulation on the emission .",
    "the latter , however , will average over one orbit , leading to a net emitted luminosity which is the same obtained when using @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "we have verified that this is indeed the case by using background values at different times and obtained values of the luminosity which can be instantaneously different , but that once integrated over time yield the same emitted em energy . as a result , the background choice   represents by far the most convenient one .",
    "we have also mentioned in section  [ sec : analysis_of_radiated_quantities ] that an alternative and equivalent estimate of the emitted em luminosity can be obtained after removing the non - radiative parts of the emission ( cf .",
    "expression  ) . in order to isolate the radiative contributions from the non - radiative ones , we have reported in figure  [ fig : phimodes ] the evolution of the real ( thick lines ) and of the imaginary ( thin lines ) parts of the @xmath167 and @xmath168 modes of @xmath110 and @xmath161 .",
    "these modes are obtained from the projection of the faraday tensor onto the tetrad  .",
    "note that the only modes that have a regular time modulation , and are therefore radiative , are @xmath169 and @xmath170 , while the real parts of the @xmath171 and @xmath172 are essentially constant in time , indicating that these are not radiative modes , and could represent a way to measure the background radiation .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath171 and @xmath172 , on the other hand , do show a regular evolution in time and a ringdown , but their values are much smaller ( i.e.  , two orders of magnitude or more ) and do not play a significant role in estimating the total radiation .    as a result ,",
    "we can write expression   explicitly as @xmath173 and in doing so we obtain an estimate that is very similar results to the ones reported in  @xcite , where expression   was used .     0.5 cm     as discussed in section  [ sec : analysis_of_radiated_quantities ] , the use of equation ( [ eq : cp ] ) as an estimate of the emitted luminosity is subject to the validity of the assumption @xmath174 , or after using equation  , of @xmath175 .",
    "this condition is true only as a first rough approximation , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : phimodes ] , which reports the evolution of @xmath176 ( red dotted line ) and of @xmath177 ( black dashed line ) , as extracted at @xmath178 for the non - spinning binary @xmath128 .",
    "clearly , these two multipoles are almost constant in time and comparable , but not identical and their difference then affects the validity of expression  .",
    "this consideration , together with the fact that expression   represents an approximation which needs to be validated a posteriori , leads us to the conclusion that equation   represents a more accurate and robust measure of the emitted luminosity in the scenario and model considered here .      having clarified our strategy in the subtraction of the background radiation , we present in figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] a comparison of the evolution , measured in hours before the merger , of the luminosities as computed with expression   and either the prescriptions   or for the background subtraction .",
    "more specifically , the thick lines refer to the total luminosity , while the thin ones to the luminosity in a polar cap of @xmath179 semi - opening angle , measured using either expression   ( red solid line ) , expression   ( blue dotted line ) , or through the expression in terms of the poynting vector   ( black dashed line ) .",
    "the left panel refers to the binary of non - spinning bhs ( i.e.  , @xmath128 ) , while the right one to the binary with spinning bhs ( i.e.  , @xmath129 ) . in both cases",
    "the extraction is made at a distance of @xmath178 and the values in cgs units refer to a binary with a total @xmath180 and a magnetic field @xmath181 .",
    "such magnetic - field strengths match the values as estimated from radio observations of parsec - scale jets in active galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "as expected the three measures match very well and , in particular , the measure made with expression   is remarkably close to the one obtained in terms of the poynting vector  , that we consider the most robust measure since it involves directly our primary evolution variables @xmath112 and @xmath59 .",
    "after the merger , both luminosities converge to a constant value which is larger than one coming from the polar - cap region ( cf .",
    "thin lines ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the background subtraction refers to a pure electrovacuum - condition ( i.e.  , uniform magnetic field in a flat spacetime ) and thus it does not provide an accurate description of an isolated spinning bh .",
    "subtracting as background that of a single bh in electrovacuum would bring the two curves down to the values of the polar cap , but we have not shown this in figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] to avoid a cluttering of curves . note also that the measure made with expression   is effectively subtracting the initial background emission and , at the same time , also including some incoming radiation ( this is true also for the measures presented by  @xcite ) . as a result , this measure is always ( slightly ) smaller than the one obtained with either prescriptions   or .",
    "for the same reason , the contributions coming from the dual jets will appear comparatively larger when using equation  .",
    "figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] also shows that the differences in the luminosities coming from the polar - cap region are instead much smaller and hardly noticeable .",
    "the reason behind this very good agreement is simple : being integrated over a small solid angle these luminosities are not influenced by the dissimilarities that the different prescriptions show instead in the emitted luminosity .",
    "overall , figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] shows that , as the merger takes place , both the diffused and the collimated em luminosity increase steeply , reaching values at the merger which are about 50 times larger than the corresponding ones a few orbits before the merger .",
    "the growth in the diffused luminosity , however , is larger than the one in the collimated luminosity and the difference in the two , which was already present at the beginning of the simulations , increases as the inspiral proceeds . as a result , at the merger",
    "the non - collimated ( total ) emission is @xmath0 times larger than the collimated one , reaching values @xmath182 for a @xmath183 binary times larger than the one in the diffused emission .",
    "however , being limited to a very small solid angle , the corresponding luminosity is 100 times smaller.][collimatedflux ] .",
    "a few comments should be reserved about the different spatial distributions of the em fluxes that come with the different prescriptions for the subtraction of the background radiation and that are erased when computing the luminosities as integral quantities .",
    "first of all we note that the em flux in equation   is not necessarily positive on the 2-sphere and that ( small ) negative contributions can appear ( see figure  1 of paper i and the corresponding color bar ) .",
    "these emissions , however , do not represent a radiative field and average to zero over one orbit ( this point was already remarked in  @xcite , where a toy model within the membrane paradigm was used for the binary ) .",
    "this non - radiative part is far from being uninteresting as it could lead to a different secondary emission as the em fields interact with the plasma .",
    "unfortunately , by construction , it is impossible to investigate such an emission within our ff approach , but this is clearly an aspect of this research that deserves further investigation .",
    "second , as already remarked in paper i , while the em fluxes do contain a dual - jet structure and even if the fluxes at the jets are @xmath12 times larger than elsewhere , the global spatial distribution is effectively dominated by a non - collimated emission of quadrupolar nature , drastically changing the prospects of the detectability of the dual jets ( see also discussion below ) .",
    "finally , the local em flux from the jets can in principle be enhanced if the bhs are spinning and , indeed , within a blandford ",
    "znajek process one expects that the luminosity from the jets increases quadratically with the spin of the bh  @xcite .",
    "the differences introduced by the spin are reported in the right panel of figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] , which refers to the binary @xmath129 and thus with bhs having a dimensionless spin of @xmath184 .",
    "clearly , both the collimated and the non - collimated emission show a behavior which is similar to the one seen for the @xmath128 binary , with only a @xmath185 enhancement of the em radiation , both in the total and in the collimated emission ( note that the two panels in figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] have the scale ) .",
    "this result is the consequence of the fact that most of the radiation that is produced is diffused and produced by the interaction between the bh orbital motion and the background magnetic field .",
    "indeed , we find that the emission in the electrovacuum evolution as computed in  @xcite is comparable to the ff one ( this is different from what reported in  @xcite ) .",
    "the local spin enhancement in the dual jets is therefore present , but still much smaller than the diffused emission , which remains the predominant one at these separations .    , and @xmath186 .",
    "thick lines refer to the diffused emission , while thin ones to the emission from a polar cap of @xmath179 semi - opening angle ; the data refer to the spinning @xmath129 binary and both the em and the gw luminosities are computed including modes up to the @xmath187 multipole .",
    "note that the gravitational - wave zone is already well defined at @xmath178 , while the em one is not even at @xmath186.,width=264 ]     0.5 cm     it is always useful to remark that by construction the newman - penrose scalars , either for the gravitational sector , i.e.  , @xmath188 , or for the em one , i.e.  , @xmath189 , provide non - ambiguous quantities only at very large distances from the sources , that is , in the corresponding `` wave zone '' .",
    "it is obvious then that any measure of such radiation quantities in the strong - field region , risks to be incorrect .",
    "less obvious is however the fact that the wave zones can be different whether one is considering the gravitational or the em radiation , with the latter starting at considerably larger distances than the former .",
    "this is summarized in figure  [ fig : lscaler ] , which reports the em ( top panel ) and the gw luminosity ( bottom panel ) integrated over 2-spheres located respectively at @xmath190 , and @xmath186 .",
    "the data refer to the spinning @xmath129 binary , with both the em and the gw luminosities having been computed including modes up to the @xmath187 multipole ; thick lines refer to the diffused emission , while thin ones to the emission from a polar cap of @xmath179 semi - opening angle . clearly , the estimates made at @xmath191 in both channels are rather different ( and incorrect ) from those made at larger radii , where the radiation has reached its wave - like solution .",
    "also striking is that while the gw estimates at @xmath178 and @xmath186 are essentially indistinguishable ( bottom panel ) , the corresponding ones in the em channel are not yet identical .",
    "this indicates first that the gw zone is much closer than the em one and reached already at @xmath192 , and , second , that extraction radii larger than @xmath193 should be considered when measuring the em radiation .",
    "we note that the evidence of a relative `` proximity '' of the gw zone to the strong - field dynamical region of spacetime is somewhat surprising , but also in substantial agreement with the bulk of evidence emerging in favor of a description of the dynamics of the bhs which is very well described by pn or other approximation techniques .",
    "this good agreement is indeed perfectly understandable if the weak - field wave zone starts only a few tens of @xmath131 away from the bhs .",
    "as remarked already in paper i , an accurate measure of the evolution of the collimated and non - collimated contributions of the emitted energies is crucial to predict the properties of the system when the two bhs are widely separated .",
    "this measure , however , is all but trivial as it requires a reliable disentanglement of the collimated emission from the non - collimated one and from the background .",
    "we have seen in figure  [ fig : lmeasure ] how the total em luminosities show a very similar evolution as long as sensible subtractions of the background radiation are used .",
    "we have also discussed that independently of the choice made , the diffused emission is mostly quadrupolar and hence with a dependence that is the same as the gw one , i.e.  , @xmath194 , as already shown by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lscalefreq ] considers more closely this issue by reporting in the left panel the change of the different gravitational and em luminosities in the orbital evolution as a function of the gw frequency @xmath195 .",
    "more specifically , we report the diffused em radiation as computed with expressions   and   ( red solid line ) and the collimated emission when computed over a polar cap with a semi - opening angle of @xmath179 ( blue solid line ) . also shown",
    "is the evolution of the gw luminosity ( black solid line ) scaled down of a factor @xmath196 to make it comparable with the other luminosities ( we recall that the efficiency in gw emission is @xmath9 orders of magnitude larger as first shown in  @xcite ) .",
    "the short - dashed , dotted , and long - dashed lines show instead the different scalings ( note the figure is a log  log plot ) .     -0.25 cm   -0.25 cm   0.cm   -0.25 cm",
    "-0.25 cm     it is then straightforward to realize that at the separations considered here the diffused emission shows a scaling with frequency which is @xmath13 , thus compatible with the scaling shown by the gw emission . the collimated emission , however , has a slower growth , with a scaling that is @xmath197 .",
    "this is different from the predicted scaling of @xmath198 suggested in  @xcite , and that we show with a light - blue long - dashed line .",
    "this difference is probably due to the fact that the estimate in  @xcite was made by studying the behavior of boosted bhs and then extrapolating the result to the case of orbiting bhs .",
    "the scaling @xmath199 is clearly incompatible with our data and we suspect the accelerated motion of the bhs to be behind this difference and longer simulations will be useful to draw robust conclusions .    given that the diffused and the collimated emissions scale differently with frequency and using the rough estimates made above for their scaling at earlier times , we can determine the frequency ( or time ) when the collimated emission will be dominant relative to the diffused one .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : lscalefreq ] , which is the same as the left one but where we extrapolate the scaling back in frequency .",
    "our rough estimate is therefore that the collimated emission will be larger than the diffused one at an orbital frequency @xmath200 and thus @xmath201 days before the merger .",
    "if the conditions are optimal and the binary is oriented in such a way that the dual - jet system points toward the earth , the luminosity from the binary would therefore be modulated on timescales @xmath202 and smaller . while this is an exciting possibility , we should also bear in mind that , when extrapolated back to the time when it becomes dominant , the collimated emission has also decreased by almost one order of magnitude and to luminosities that are only of the order of @xmath203 .",
    "luminosities @xmath204 are also typical of radio - loud galaxies and thus the determination of an em counterpart can be challenging if such sources are near the candidate event . clearly , the bottom line of these considerations is that longer simulations need to be performed to assess the early - inspiral scaling of the different luminosities and more realistic scenarios need to be considered to assess whether the collimated or the diffused emission can serve as an em counterpart to the merger of binary system of supermassive bhs ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for some recent attempts ) .",
    "-2.0 cm   -2.0 cm   0.5 cm   -2.0 cm   -2.0 cm      in this concluding section we concentrate on the spatial distribution of the charge density produced during the inspiral and merger , providing information which is complementary to the one already presented by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we recall that in our simulations the charge density is not an evolutionary quantity , but , rather , it is computed from the constraint equation  .",
    "we also recall that because we are very effective in enforcing the ff condition ( see discussion in section  [ sec : affe ] ) , we can not fully explore the physical consequences of the charge distribution we produce .",
    "this is because in the most interesting regions of these distributions , that is , in those regions with no ( or very small ) net charges and which are reminiscent of the _ vacuum - gap _ regions in pulsar magnetospheres  @xcite , the electric field along the magnetic field will be zero to machine precision and hence it will not be able to accelerate particles to very high lorentz factors ( as instead is expected in the polar regions of pulsar magnetospheres ) . to further limit the amount of information that can be extracted directly from our simulation",
    "is the fact that an ff code does not allow for an unambiguous calculation of the plasma velocity , which can only be estimated a posteriori based on a certain number of assumptions . as an example",
    ",  @xcite argued that it is possible to compute the final lorentz factor of a plasma in an ff magnetosphere if there is a non - negligible component of the parallel electric field and a radiation drag dominated by thompson scattering .    in spite of these limitations ,",
    "the charge - density distribution remains a very interesting quantity and we have reported it in figures  [ fig : chargedens2d ] and  [ fig : chargedens3d ] .",
    "the three top panels of figure  [ fig : chargedens2d ] , in particular , show the charge distribution on the @xmath160 plane , while the bottom ones on the @xmath159 planes at three different instants in the evolution of the spinning binary @xmath129 . more specifically , in the early inspiral phase ( @xmath205 ) , at the merger ( @xmath206 ) , and at ringdown ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "the color code highlights the presence of positive ( red ) and negative ( blue ) charges , which are produced both because of the orbital motion of the bhs , but also because of the intrinsic spin of the bh .",
    "the first contribution can be appreciated from the first two columns of figure  [ fig : chargedens2d ] , while the second contribution is the only one responsible for the charge distribution in the last column .",
    "much of this distribution of charges can be easily interpreted within the membrane paradigm  @xcite as the result of an effective hall effect arising when the bh horizon ( i.e.  , the `` membrane '' ) moves , either as a result the orbital motion or through its spinning motion , across a magnetic field . in analogy with the classical hall effect",
    ", a charge separation will be produced as shown in figure  [ fig : chargedens2d ] ( see also the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "note that since they both refer to isolated spinning bhs ( although with different spins ) , the right column of figure  [ fig : chargedens2d ] should be compared with the right column of figure  [ fig : current2d ] , which shows instead the electric currents .",
    "additional information is shown in figure  [ fig : chargedens3d ] , where the charge - density distribution is rendered in three dimensions at the same representative times shown in the panels of figure  [ fig : chargedens2d ] and on much larger length scales .",
    "this representation highlights that the distribution is far more complex than a simple dual - jet structure and is instead typical of a double - helical symmetry , similar to the pattern for the poynting flux shown in  @xcite .",
    "although it is not possible to investigate further , within an ff approach , the consequences of this regular and alternate distribution of positive and negative charges , it is clear that it can lead to rather intriguing particle acceleration processes along the surfaces separating regions of different charges .",
    "the resulting accelerated particles could further cascade into less energetic charges and lead to a potentially detectable emission .",
    "it is worth remarking , however , that the charge - density distribution is not restricted to a small cylindrical area comprising the two inspiralling bhs , as it may erroneously appear from the top panels of figure  [ fig : chargedens3d ] , and which shows only the regions where the charge density is the largest .",
    "rather , it involves the whole region in causal contact with the binary , as shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : chargedens3d ] , which refer instead to the ringdown phase only ( @xmath207 ) . starting from the left ,",
    "the different panels are drawn exhibiting increasingly smaller values of the charge density and thus revealing a much more extended conical - shaped structure with a double - helical distribution of opposite charges at its core .",
    "additional investigations away from the ff regime will be necessary to assess the astrophysical impact of these structures .",
    "assessing the detectability of the em emission from merging bh binaries is much more than an academic exercise .",
    "the detection of em counterpart , in fact , will not only act as a confirmation of the gw detection , but it will also provide a new tool for testing a number of fundamental astrophysical issues  @xcite . in particular , it will offer the possibility of testing models of galaxy mergers and accretion disks , of probing basic aspects of gravitational physics , and of determining cosmological parameters once the redshift is known  @xcite .    computing reliable estimates from this scenario is made difficult by the scarce knowledge of the physical conditions in the vicinity of the binary when this is about to merge .",
    "nevertheless , relying on a number of assumptions with varying degree of realism , several investigations have been recently carried out to investigate the properties of these em counterparts either during the stages that precede the merger or in those following it . as an example , several authors have recently considered the interaction between the binary and a dense gas cloud  @xcite even though astrophysical considerations seem to suggest that during the very final stages of the merger the smbbh will inspiral in a rather tenuous intergalactic medium . at the same time ,",
    "scenarios which do not involve dense matter distributions in the vicinity of the binary have also been considered . in these cases ,",
    "the smbbh is assumed to be inspiralling in electrovacuum and in the presence of an external magnetic field which is anchored to the circumbinary disk  @xcite and the energy emitted in em waves is @xmath9 orders of magnitude smaller than the one emitted in gw for a typical binary of supermassive bhs with mass @xmath208 in an ambient magnetic field of @xmath209  @xcite .    furthermore , when charges and currents are considered within an ff regime , the numerical results of  @xcite have shown that , if taking place in a uniform magnetic field , the merger event would be accompanied by the em emission from a dual - jet structure , acting as a fingerprint of the merger itself .",
    "a detailed analysis carried out in  @xcite addressed the problem of whether such merger flares can be detected by ongoing and planned wide - field radio surveys , such as the square kilometer array pathfinder  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that , owing to the short timescales associated with the merger , no more than one event per year would be detectable by such blind surveys .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite we have revisited the estimates made in  @xcite and shown that while a dual - jet structure is present during the inspiral , and while the fluxes can be larger near the jet , the collimated luminosity is subdominant of a factor @xmath0 with respect to the total luminosity , which is instead predominantly quadrupolar .",
    "furthermore , spin - related enhancements are only very small and less than @xmath185 when considering a spinning binary with dimensionless spins @xmath210 .",
    "our results have been obtained adopting a consistent measurement of the em luminosity and an improved numerical strategy for the treatment of the ff condition , both of which have been discussed in detail in this paper .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that we do not implement the ff condition at a discrete level , but rather we obtain it via a damping scheme which drives the solution to satisfy the correct condition .",
    "this difference is important for a correct and accurate description of the current sheets that can develop in the course of the simulation .",
    "we have also studied in greater detail the three - dimensional charge distribution produced as a consequence of the inspiral and shown that it possesses a complex but ordered structure with a double - helical distribution of opposite charges tracing the motion of the two bhs .",
    "although our simulations show that the dual - jet structure is subdominant on the timescale over which the simulations have been carried out , they also indicate that the growth rates of the collimated and diffused luminosities are different , thus suggesting that sufficiently early in the inspiral the collimated emission will be the dominant one .",
    "computing accurately these scaling rates is of course crucial since it allows for the determination of the time during the inspiral in which the dual jets are dominant could modulate the emission if the binary is suitably oriented . when considering the observational implications of this possibility",
    ",  @xcite have concluded that future blind radio surveys like vast  @xcite would easily detect the effects of these modulations , with a frequency of up to one per day .",
    "we have therefore provided the first quantitative estimates of the scaling of the em emission with frequency and shown that the diffused part has a dependence that is very close to the one exhibited by the gw luminosity and therefore of the type @xmath211 .",
    "the collimated em emission , on the other hand , scales like @xmath2 , thus with a steeper dependence than @xmath212 , as previously suggested by  @xcite . in light of these scalings and considering a non - spinning binary , we conclude that the collimated emission will be larger than the diffused one at an orbital frequency of @xmath213 and thus @xmath201 days before the merger .. ] when this happens , the collimated luminosity will be about an order of magnitude smaller than the one considered here and of the order of @xmath214 for a typical @xmath183 binary in a magnetic field of @xmath215 .",
    "such a luminosity is about 1000 times smaller than the typical luminosity of radio - loud galaxies and thus determination of an em counterpart can be challenging if such sources are near the candidate event .    as a concluding remark",
    "we note that while our study addresses several points which were not fully investigated before , it also leaves open a number of questions .",
    "one of these questions is the efficiency of the secondary emission that could be generated either by the diffused component or by the collimated one .",
    "the richly complex structure of the charge - density distribution , in fact , can be the site where even small electric fields along the magnetic field lines would be able to accelerate particles to very high lorentz factors , leading to a secondary emission similar to the one expected in the polar regions of pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "unfortunately , however , our use of an ff condition ( and our ability to maintain it essentially to machine precision ) prevents us from producing such electric fields and hence the corresponding accelerations .",
    "another and related unresolved issue is the fate of the poynting flux once it impacts the intergalactic medium . even in the optimistic case in which the majority of the poynting flux is converted into radio emission via synchrotron processes , the em radiation ( either collimated or diffused ) will eventually exit the evacuated central region around the binary and penetrate in the ambient medium .",
    "when this happens , part of the poynting flux will be converted into kinetic energy and reprocessed in several em wavebands , not necessarily in the radio range . of the poynting flux",
    "can be converted into kinetic energy leading to flows with lorentz factors of the order of @xmath216  @xcite . ] clearly , longer simulations and more realistic scenarios are needed to shed further light on the properties of the em counterpart to the inspiral and merger of binary of supermassive bhs .",
    "we thank l. lehner and c. palenzuela for insightful discussions on the analysis of the radiated quantities .",
    "we are grateful to e. schnetter for his help in the implementation of the rkimex methods , i. hinder and b. wardell for some of the analysis tools used in this work , and e. bentivegna and k. dionysopoulou for help with the visualization of the currents and charges .",
    "this work was supported in part by the dfg grant sfb / transregio  7 ; the computations were made at the aei and on the teragrid network ( tg - mca02n014 ) .",
    "the prototype of the stiff system of partial differential equations can be written as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the relaxation time . in the limit",
    "@xmath219 the system becomes stiff , since the relaxation of the stiff term @xmath220 is very different from the timescale of the non - stiff part @xmath221 .",
    "the evolution of the electric field   becomes stiff for high values of the conductivity @xmath69 in the ohm law  .",
