    "cygnus  x-2 is a bright persistent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxrb ) , whose x - ray spectrum has been studied from @xmath40.1 to several hundred kev .",
    "together with some of the other bright persistent lmxrb sources it is classified as a `` _ z _ '' source ( hasinger &  van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "the changes in the x - ray spectral shape of _ z _ sources are subtle , but in an x - ray color - color diagram the sources trace out _ z_-like shaped patterns .",
    "they move through the _ z _ in a smooth manner without jumping from branch to branch .",
    "_ z _ sources are thought to be accreting material at near - eddington rates via an accretion disk onto a neutron star ( e.g. hasinger et al .",

    "the lecs was only operated during satellite night - time giving a total on - source exposure of 7.1ks .",
    "a spectrum was extracted centered on the mean source position using the standard lecs extraction radius of 8@xmath7 and the appropriate response matrix was generated .",
    "background subtraction was performed using a standard blank field 46ks exposure , but is not critical for such a bright source .",
    "the spectrum was rebinned to have at least 20 counts per channel .",
    "channels below 0.2kev were discarded since the source is absorbed below this energy .",
    "the mean lecs count rate observed from  is 67s@xmath10 , which corresponds to an observed 110kev flux of 7.4@xmath110@xmath31erg@xmath3s@xmath10 .",
    "the ground calibration of the lecs is discussed in parmar et al .",
    "the effective area @xmath322  kev is primarily limited by the entrance window transmission , and at higher energies by the loss of reflectivity of the mirror system .",
    "great care was taken to determine the entrance window transmission using monochromatic x - ray sources ( bavdaz et al .",
    "the lecs spectral response was updated following the first  observation of the crab nebula on 1996 september 6 .",
    "when the lecs spectrum is fit by an absorbed power - law model , the individual energy channel residuals are @xmath325%",
    ". the calibration status of the  instruments , derived from the above observation , is discussed in cusumano et al .",

    "the  spectrum can be modeled by a cut - off power - law ( @xmath33 ) ) together with low energy absorption , n@xmath13 , which gives a @xmath34 of 1.45 for 925 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , see also table  1 .",
    "examination of the residuals shows excess counts near 1kev which are unlikely to originate from calibration uncertainties or other instrumental effects .",
    "these excess counts can be modeled by a blackbody of temperature 0.181@xmath35  kev giving a @xmath34 of 1.25 for 923 dof .",
    "however , previous observations of  have required much higher blackbody temperatures of 1.01.5  kev ( e.g.  hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ) , and it is therefore unlikely that this feature is the blackbody previously observed from the source . replacing the blackbody with a broad gaussian line feature with an energy , e@xmath24 , of @xmath25  kev , a full width at half - maximum , fwhm , of 0.47@xmath00.07kev and an equivalent width , ew , of ( 74@xmath5)ev in the fit gives a better fit with a @xmath34 of 1.20 for 922 dof .",
    "f_-test indicates that this difference is significant , but only at the 1@xmath36 level .",
    "higher energy resolution  observations than that reported here ( e.g.  using the _ einstein _ objective grating spectrometer ( ogs ) ; see vrtilek et al .  1988 ) , require the presence of multiple line features near 1  kev .",
    "this supports the interpretation of the excess emission seen in the lecs as unresolved line emission .",

    "1 shows the observed count spectrum and the best - fit model when the normalization of the emission feature is set to zero .",
    "in addition to the feature at @xmath41kev , there is evidence for weak narrow - line features at 1.54@xmath00.03 , 2.01@xmath00.02 , and 2.61@xmath00.02kev in the lecs spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "including all three lines in the fit reduces the @xmath28 to 1.15 for 916 dof .",
    "the energies of two of these lines are consistent with ly@xmath37 transitions of h - like si  xiv and s  xvi at 2.00 and 2.62kev , respectively ( see e.g.  raymond 1993 ) .",
    "however , we caution that these features have energies close to those of the mirror au edges , where the lecs calibration is more uncertain",

    "these differences imply that the shape of the feature , as well as its overall ew , varies from observation to observation .",
    "it is notable that the narrow line model only accounts for about half the line flux of the excess emission as seen with the lecs , implying the presence of other features near 1kev .",
    "the fe - l emission may be produced by photoionization of the surface of the accretion disk and the accretion disk corona by the strong x - ray continuum flux emanating from the central regions ( see e.g.  kallman et al .",

    "our measurements indicate that this ratio is @xmath321.2 ( 3@xmath36 ) , consistent with these calculations .",
    "the strength of the low - energy feature is expected to be dependent on the temperature and density of the illuminated corona ( e.g.  lidahl @xcite ; kallman @xcite ) , and probably indirectly on the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star which probably influences the x - ray continuum and shape of the inner accretion disk . since these parameters can vary from observation to observation",
