    "it is a well known effect that the operation of ion chambers in a high ionization environment is limited by the space charge accumulated in the chamber active volume .",
    "this space charge is dominated by the positive ions since the electrons move with a drift velocity 1,000 times larger .",
    "the resulting electric field inside the chamber is no more uniform and it takes its least absolute value near the anode .",
    "+ when this value reaches zero the electron collection stops and the chamber becomes saturated .",
    "it is well known @xcite that a distinction between long and short pulses should be made when attempting to calculate saturation effects . in the short pulse approximation",
    "the duration of ionization and charge collection time is short with respect to the time the positive ions need to move appreciably with respect to the distance d between the chamber electrodes . in this approximation",
    "the positive ions are considered practically immovable throughout the whole electron collection time , thus the space charge density inside the chamber is uniform and constant . in the long pulse approximation",
    "the duration of ionization is long enough that a steady state is reached . in this state",
    "the number of collected positive ions per unit time is equal to the number of generated by the external ionization factor .",
    "the space chargg is no more depending on time but only on the position x between the chamber electrodes .",
    "+ in this paper we derive a time dependent solution of the space charge accummulated in the chamber .",
    "we have made the assumption that the positive ions are moving with a constant drift velocity @xmath0=@xmath1 throughout the whole ionization and charge collection time .",
    "this solution collapses into the short pulse approximation for ionization times much less than the characteristic time of the chamber @xmath2 , and yields the steady state solution for ionization times larger or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we derive a simple expression for the quantity @xmath2 , the characteristic time of the ion chamber , as well as for the electric fiels inside the chamber as a function of space and time .",
    "+ finally we derive a modified saturation equation , which defines the conditions that the operational paramenters of the ion chamber should satisfy in order for the detector to operate free of saturation effects .",
    "this equation is a function not only of the positive ion mobility @xmath3 , the electrode gap d and the externally applied voltage @xmath4 , but a function of the duration t of the external ionization as well .",
    "+ throughout the discussion we have assumed that the cathode plate is kept at potential -v@xmath5 at x=0 and the anode is grounded at x = d . in our calculations",
    "we have used the esu system of units .",
    "the accummulation of space charge inside the ion chamber , subjected in a constant external ionization rate n , is governed by the continuity equations : @xmath6 for the positive ions , and : @xmath7 for the electrons.@xcite here u@xmath8 is the positive ion and u@xmath9 the electron drift velocities . for x = d p(d ,",
    "t)=0 , and for x=0 n(0,t)=0 that is the consentration of positive ions next to the anode and the consentration of electrons next to the cathode are always zero . also at t=0 p(x,0)=n(x,0)=0 . in the steady state : + p(x)=@xmath10 and n(x)=@xmath11 + since the mobility of the electrons is 1,000 larger than the positive ions we can ignore the electron contribution to the spacecharge and thus we will write for the steady state : +   + @xmath12(x)=@xmath13 +   + where e(x ) is the electric field in the active volume of the chamber in the steady state and @xmath3 is the positive ion mobility . by solving the maxwell equations we get for the electric field : +   + @xmath14 if we imposing the initial conditions v(0)=-v@xmath5 and v(d)=0 we get the relationship : +   + @xmath15 with z=@xmath16 +   + for real values of z the second part of the equation is greater than 1 , so in order for e(d ) to exist : +   + @xmath17 +   + this is a condition the operating parameters of the ion chamber must satisfy in order for the ion chamber to operate free of saturation effects , provided that the steady state has been reached .",

    "+   + under this approximation the steady state saturation condition yields : +   + @xmath21 .",
    "+   + this approximate condition based on the assumption of constant positive ion drift velocity differs from the one based on the exact positive ion drift velocity , by a correction factor @xmath221.22 .",
    "when the ion chamber is subjected to an intense short lived ionization pulse the short pulse approximation is more suitable to describe the space charge effectsin the operation of the detector .",
    "we can model the space charge density inside the chamber at the end of the ionization pulse as @xmath12 , constant throughout the chamber volume .",
    "solution of maxwell equations for the electric field yields : +   + e(x)=4@xmath23x-2@xmath23d-@xmath24=-4@xmath25(x@xmath26-x ) where x@xmath26=@xmath27+@xmath28 +   + the electric field becomes zero at x = x@xmath26 .",

    "+   + an interesting consequence of the short pulse approximation is that always , a portion of the fast moving electrons is collected . if we suppose that the whole ionisation happens instantaneously the fast electron swarm will keep moving ( and collected at the anode ) from x=0 to x = x@xmath26 where the electric field becomes zero .",
    "we have considered the electron drift velocity as a product of the electron mobility times the electric field . if we suppose that all the electrons from x=0 to x = x@xmath26 have been collected and electrons between x = x@xmath26 and x = d have been lost ( since the drift velosity has become zero ) , the collection efficiency can be estimated as +   + @xmath31 if @xmath32d otherwise @xmath33=1 +   + we have ignored all recombination effects during the electron movement .",
    "we see that for extremely fast pulses the collection efficiency is at least 0.5 , even with the chamber operating under saturation conditions .",
    "the collection efficiency also increases linearly with the applied voltage v@xmath5 and it is inverseley proportional to the charge density @xmath12 .",
    "recently conducted experiments have observed this effect.@xcite",

    "after a brief review of the operation of ion chambers in an intense ionization environment we presented a formula describing the time development of the space charge inside the chamber .",
    "the formula collapses into the short pulse approximation for short enough ionization pulses with respect to the characteristic time of chamber t@xmath5 and reproduces the steady state solution if the externally caused ionization lasts long enough .",
    "although the formula has been derived under the assumption that the positive ions are moving always with a constant drift velocity @xmath77 , it helps us to understand ( qualitatively and up to some degree quantitatively ) the operation of ion chambers .",

    "* both , the short pulse approximation and the steady state represent valid solutions in judging saturation effects in ion chambers . * the steady state is reached throughout the whole chamber volume within a finite time t@xmath5 ( the characteristic time of the ion chamber ) after the onset of the external ionization process .",
    "however , as we showed in this paper , different points reach the steady state at different times . * for short enough pulsed beams with respect to the ion chamber characteristic time",
    "the positive ion mobility @xmath3 does not play any role in judging saturation effects . @xcite * saturation effects should be judged by taking into account not only the chamber operating voltage , gap and ion mobility but the duration of the ionization process as well . *",
    "whether we assume that the positive ions move with constant drift velocity or their speed is affected by the variation of the electric field due to the space charge , for short pulses both solutions collapse into the short pulse approximation and no distinction is made .",
    "corrections may be important when the steady state is formed due to the different space distribution of the positive ion charge density inside the chamber .",
    "the maximum correction must be applied when steady state is reached . as we have seen that factor",
