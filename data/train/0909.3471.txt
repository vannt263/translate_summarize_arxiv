    " + \" are large rapidity gaps ( @xmath10 units ) with _ no _ particles . in the collider detector at fermilab , cdf  @xcite",
    ", we can not detect the forward @xmath11 or , except for some large @xmath5 events , the @xmath12 .",
    "however we installed scintillation counters ( beam shower counters , bsc ) along the beam pipe , which detected showers from particles out to pseudorapidity @xmath13 = 7.4 .",
    "requiring them to be empty selects events in which the @xmath11 and @xmath12 did not fragment and went down the beam pipe .    in the standard model the only significant coherent @xmath14-channel exchanges over such large rapidity gaps are color singlets with charge @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 , or effective spin @xmath17 , @xmath18 1",
    "these are the photon , @xmath19 , pomeron @xmath20 ( c=+1 ) and odderon @xmath21 ( c = -1 ) .",
    "@xmath7-boson exchange would be allowed , but the proton would inevitably break up . the odderon has not yet been convincingly observed ; in our observation of exclusive @xmath22 and @xmath23 reported in this meeting by pinfold  @xcite we placed a new limit . in this talk",
    "i will report on cdf measurements of exclusive lepton pairs , @xmath24 above the charmonium region , see fig.1 .",
    "this includes non - resonant ( qed ) @xmath25 , and photoproduction : @xmath26 .",
    "we can also search for exclusive @xmath27 , but the cross section is very small and its observation probably requires no additional collisions ( no pile - up ) .",
    "this process , like exclusive @xmath28 , is a good test of exclusive higgs boson production , as the qcd part of the feynman diagrams is identical .",
    "while our cdf studies provide good tests of qcd with large rapidity gaps , and hard pomeron behavior , they are also precursors to processes with @xmath29 100 gev / c@xmath3 at the lhc  @xcite , where @xmath1 can be @xmath30 etc .",
    ", including any exotic particles that couple to gluons or photons and have the right quantum numbers .",
    "if states such as higgs bosons are seen this way at the lhc , their mass , width , spin , c - parity and coupling @xmath31 can be determined in unique ways .",
    "even a pair of nearby states , e.g. mssm @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be resolved , which is impossible by other means .",
    "the central detector of cdf  @xcite has layers of silicon tracking and drift chambers surrounded by a time - of - flight scintillation counter barrel , in a solenoidal field .",
    "this is surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , muon scintillators and tracking chambers .",
    "the forward region , @xmath34 , has , on each side , a 48-channel cherenkov luminosity counter hodoscope , a `` miniplug '' calorimeter , a set of beam shower counters , bsc , and on the outgoing @xmath12 side , scintillating fiber trackers in roman pots .",
    "the bsc were very important as rapidity gap detectors in no - pile - up events , and for triggering on exclusive events .",
    "they are relatively simple scintillation counters around the beam pipes covering @xmath35 . only bsc-1 sees primary particles , and it has two radiation lengths in front to convert photons ; the others see showers created in the beam pipe . we have proposed them for cms  @xcite ; all lhc experiments should have them !",
    "another recommendation to all experiments is to record zero - bias , or bunch - crossing , triggers routinely , e.g. at 1 hz .",
    "these were essential in our cdf exclusive studies .",
    "we divided those events into two classes : [ a ] = probably no interaction , e.g. no tracks , and [ b ] at least one interaction , with tracks from the beam line .",
    "then for each subdetector , e.g. bsc-1 which had 8 pmts , we plotted the `` hottest '' pmt as log(max adc counts in bsc-1 ) for events in classes [ a ] and [ b ] .",
    "one can also plot the sum @xmath36 .",
    "repeating for all subdetectors , one finds cuts that select events with all the cdf detectors empty , except for the state @xmath1 .",
    "in march 2001 some of us proposed  @xcite to add very forward proton tracking detectors to cdf to look for exclusive higgs boson production . at that time some theorists ( cited in ref .",
    "@xcite ) had suggested that the cross section could be as high as 10 - 100 fb , and a signal could be seen using the missing mass technique  @xcite .",
    "the durham group prediction  @xcite was a factor @xmath37 lower , at 0.06 fb ( for m(h ) = 120 gev ) , impossibly low for the tevatron .",
    "incidentally in ref .  @xcite we suggested for the first time that exclusive @xmath38 production is a good test of the theory , and that troublesome pile - up can be highly suppressed with  fast timing cherenkov counters \" . given the very large theoretical uncertainty on @xmath39 , the proposal could not proceed at that time , but we embarked on a program to measure related exclusive processes with cross sections accessible even in the durham model .",
    "we have now measured @xmath40 final states with @xmath41 and dijets @xmath42 , all of which have very similar qcd diagrams and issues , and all three are consistent with the durham group predictions ( which have a factor `` a few '' uncertainty ) .",
    "one can now be certain that it is possible to produce a higgs boson ( if it exists ) at the lhc with no other particles , and reasonably confident that their prediction @xmath43 1 - 10 fb at @xmath44 = 14 tev is not unrealistic",
    ". the cross section can be much higher in some beyond sm scenarios .",
    "the exclusive processes measured in cdf have different strengths and weaknesses .",
    "@xmath45 is the cleanest as the photons , like the higgs , have no strong interactions .",
    "looking at the feynman diagrams through a ",
    "qcd - only filter \" they are identical ; simply the @xmath46-loop ( mostly @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) becomes a @xmath14-loop and @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath49 .",
    "but the cross section is very small .",
    "the durham prediction  @xcite is 36 fb for @xmath50 and @xmath51 gev .",
    "this corresponds to 0.8@xmath52 events in the cdf search  @xcite ; 3 candidates were found , of which 2 were  perfect \" with two single narrow electromagnetic showers , while the third had some characteristics of @xmath53 ( broader showers ) .",
    "note that the two golden candidates were distilled from @xmath54 inelastic collisions ; such things can be done !",
    "@xmath55 is also clean and has a much bigger cross section : @xmath56  nb ( cdf  @xcite ) , compared with 90 nb ( with a large uncertainty ) predicted by durham  @xcite .",
    "the weakness is that the charm mass is small so the process is not very perturbative , the @xmath28 is colorless but it is still a hadron with final state interactions , and resolving @xmath57 and @xmath58 is difficult .",
    "the @xmath59 is more perturbative than the @xmath28 , so the theory is under better control , but the cross section is expected to be only about 1/500th that of the @xmath28 and the decay modes are not well known . for the @xmath60",
    "the particle data group gives only @xmath61 6% , with no other modes well known , so it will not be possible to give a cross section soon .",
    "( some hadronic decays with poorly known branching fractions are impossible to trigger on in a normal collider environment . )",
    "finally cdf also measured  @xcite exclusive di - jets , produced by the process @xmath62 with a color - cancelling gluon exchange .",
    "the cross section is quite large , @xmath63 100 pb for two jets with @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 , with the dijet having @xmath66 80% of the total central mass , i.e. @xmath67 . in this region",
    "there is an excess of dijets compared with inclusive dijet expectations .",
    "the data , out to jet @xmath68 = 35 gev , agree within a factor @xmath69 with the durham prediction  @xcite , but are more than an order of magnitude lower than the dpemc prediction  @xcite .",
    "the main particle states that can be produced exclusively in double pomeron exchange , @xmath70 , are @xmath71 and @xmath49 .",
    "the first two were observed at the isr  @xcite and , less cleanly , at the sps ( fixed target ) , and the @xmath28 is now established  @xcite . the other accessible states are @xmath38 and @xmath42 .",
    "it will be very hard to get a good ( @xmath72 25% ) measurement of the @xmath59 , but @xmath49 appears to be in reach at the lhc , provided the two protons can be measured .",
    "( double proton tagging for @xmath73 at high enough luminosity to get some events is probably not feasible , due to its low mass . )    in cdf we observed @xmath74 collisions with @xmath75 5 gev for the first time in hadron- hadron collisions .",
    "we published  @xcite 16 events ( backgound @xmath76 1.9 ) with @xmath77 10 gev / c@xmath3 in excellent agreement with the lpair monte carlo .",
    "the highest mass event was at 38 gev / c@xmath3 , and all pairs are very back - to - back with ( @xmath78 . we followed that with a search  @xcite for exclusive @xmath7 , in the process finding eight @xmath79 or @xmath80 events with @xmath81 from 40 to 75 gev / c@xmath3 . again",
    " qed rules \" , and the lepton pairs all have @xmath82 .",
    "this mass reach is as high as ( or higher than ) @xmath79 at lep ( which has no strongly interacting background ) and @xmath83 at hera .",
    "this demonstrates that exclusive dileptons can be extracted from the huge backgrounds in hadron - hadron collisions , which is good news as they provide an excellent ( probably the best ) calibration of the momentum scale and resolution of the high precision proton spectrometers being planned  @xcite for atlas and cms .",
    "one does not need to see both protons to calibrate the spectrometers , as each one is very well known ( ultimately limited by the incoming beam momentum spread , @xmath84 ) . the use of exclusive qed dileptons , with precisely known cross section , to measure the machine luminosity ( integrated over a period , perhaps days ) , has been suggested .",
    "unfortunately the precision is likely to be limited by unseen proton dissociation , and knowledge of efficiencies , acceptance and non - exclusive background .",
    "( one can not require no pile - up , as the result would then depend on @xmath85 which is _ a priori _ unknown ) .",
    "exclusive @xmath7 production is allowed in the standard model : a radiated virtual photon fluctuates to a @xmath86 pair , which scatters by hard pomeron exchange on the other proton , followed by @xmath87 , as in exclusive vector meson photoproduction , see fig .",
    "1 . however the sm cross section is much too small at the tevatron : 0.3 fb  @xcite or 0.21 fb  @xcite . at the lhc ( 14 tev ) the predictions are 13 fb  @xcite and 69 fb  @xcite , which may make an observation possible . a signal at the tevatron , or a significantly higher cross section at the lhc ,",
    "would be evidence for new particles with strong and electroweak couplings .",
    "white s theory  @xcite of the supercritical pomeron predicts color - sextet quarks coupling strongly to the pomeron and to the @xmath88 and @xmath7 , and he expects a much enhanced cross section , but without a quantitative prediction .",
    "we used a sample of 3.17@xmath89 lepton pairs with @xmath90 40 gev / c@xmath3 , of which 1.83@xmath89 were in the @xmath7 peak .",
    "we required exclusivity over the full range @xmath91 , finding 8 events , agreeing with qed expectations .",
    "2 shows the mass and azimuthal difference distributions of these events .",
    "all events were very back - to - back in the transverse plane , with @xmath92 .",
    "one event with @xmath93 = 66 gev / c@xmath3 had a @xmath12 track in the roman pots ; for the others the @xmath12 was out of their acceptance or they were not operational .",
    "none of the eight exclusive events were @xmath7-candidates , and a limit was placed : @xmath94 0.96 pb at 95% c.l .",
    "= 92 gev / c@xmath3 , and @xmath95 ( larger than expected for qed ) was rejected ; it failed the exclusivity requirement only in the bsc counters on one arm .",
    "it has the characteristics of a photoproduced @xmath7 but with a proton dissociation .",
    "however with only one event no claim can be made .",
    "] a nice check of the exclusivity analysis comes from @xmath96 events , which can not be exclusive , but otherwise are very similar to @xmath7 , and which are more abundant . it may be possible to improve this limit using a factor 2 - 3 more data and including pile - up events , using the requirements of no associated tracks on the @xmath97 vertex , small ( @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 .",
    "we are testing this method on the upsilon region , with @xmath100 gev / c@xmath3 .",
    "the qed is a good control , and the photoproduced @xmath101 states have cross sections that are within reach , although not very well known .",
    "( the hera data  @xcite do not resolve clearly the @xmath102 and @xmath103 states and have quite large uncertainties . )",
    "predictions for @xmath104 are  @xcite are around 5 - 14 pb . applying the branching fraction to @xmath80 or @xmath79 , @xmath105 , would give a few hundred events in 2 fb@xmath106 ( @xmath107 the acceptance and efficiency ) .",
    "hera has provided a nice compilation  @xcite of exclusive cross sections for vector mesons from @xmath108 to @xmath109 vs. @xmath110 . in cdf with @xmath111",
    "we have @xmath112 80 gev and @xmath113 136 gev . at hera",
    "the ratio of these cross sections is @xmath76 300 .",
    "we are studying this region both in @xmath80 and @xmath79 events .",
    "for the dimuons we used a trigger with two muons with @xmath114 4 gev / c and @xmath115 0.6 .",
    "the inclusive @xmath93 spectrum shows the states @xmath102 and @xmath103 as well - separated peaks , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ; the mass resolution is only @xmath116 50 mev / c@xmath3 , less than the mass differences .",
    "separation is important in order to measure exclusive @xmath117 , which feed differently the three states .",
    "inclusively the ratio @xmath118:continuum is about 8:1 . requiring no other tracks on the @xmath80 vertex , @xmath119 0.1 rad and @xmath120 1.5 gev / c retains both @xmath121 and continuum events , but we can not yet claim that these events are exclusive .",
    "these cuts should be efficient for the qed events and for most of the @xmath101 s ; the issue is non - exclusive backgrounds in the presence of other interactions .",
    "we are now studying the continuum to see if it is exactly as expected for qed , as a control , and can then give @xmath101-photoproduction cross sections , depending on unknown backgrounds from @xmath122 .",
    "unfortunately neither the @xmath59 production rates nor their radiative decays are known .",
    "the @xmath123 distribution is broader for @xmath59-daughters , which may help , but one would like to reconstruct the photons , which is probably not possible with pile - up .",
    "the same issues will confront us at the lhc .    for the @xmath124 channel we chose to veto pile - up , and used a trigger requiring two electromagnetic showers with @xmath125 gev and @xmath115 2 m , and forward gaps ( bsc-1 empty ) .",
    "our prime motivation for this trigger is to search for additional exclusive @xmath38 candidates , and hopefully to make a definitive observation . compared with our earlier search",
    ", we lowered the trigger threshold from 4 gev to 2 gev , took more data , will expand the @xmath126-coverage and use better background ( @xmath127 ) rejection .",
    "analysis is underway .",
    "the same trigger collects qed @xmath79 pairs with @xmath128 8 gev / c@xmath3 , and @xmath124 decays .",
    "the qed data is a good control of our exclusivity cuts , and the @xmath101 candidates can be compared with our @xmath129 candidates . as these events are without pile - up , we may have some @xmath130 candidates attributable to @xmath59 ( but not many are expected ) .",
    "the decay photon tends to be soft ( namely 391(442 ) mev in the @xmath101-frame ) for the @xmath131 , and is poorly measured .",
    "other exclusive final states are probably not useful , mainly because of trigger limitations .    can exclusive @xmath101 photoproduction be seen with a forward proton tag at 420 m at the lhc ?",
    "we have @xmath132 ( @xmath133 is the fractional momentum loss of the proton ) , and the most likely kinematics are @xmath134 gev / c , @xmath135 . to have one proton with @xmath133 as large as ( say ) 0.01 we need a muon pair with @xmath136 2.5 , at the limit of the muon coverage in cms .",
    "a more serious problem with using @xmath137 for proton calibration is that many @xmath121s , perhaps even most , will be decay products of @xmath59 states and the proton momenta are then not known . for these reasons the qed @xmath138 with @xmath139 gev / c@xmath3 will probably be the calibration channel .",
    "electron pairs are less favorable due to final state radiation and bremsstrahlung . with @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    "= 20 gev / c@xmath3",
    "the cross section is 1.6 pb . one proton will usually have much too small @xmath142 , but fortunately both protons are known and one can be used to calibrate the spectrometers .    in conclusion ,",
    "five years ago the predictions for exclusive higgs production had more than two orders of magnitude spread .",
    "since then in cdf we have measured three related processes , exclusive @xmath143 and @xmath28 , all consistent with the predictions of the durham group within the quoted factor of  a few \" .",
    "especially the @xmath28 observation means that exclusive higgs production must happen , if there is a higgs boson .",
    "our observation of exclusive photoproduced vector mesons demonstrates that exclusive @xmath7 photoproduction must be possible , albeit with a small cross section ( in the standard model ) at the lhc .",
    "our observations of exclusive @xmath4 ( with a forward proton detected ) are encouraging for forward spectrometer calibrations , and mean that @xmath144 ( and @xmath145 if sleptons exist ) could be measured .",
    "this bodes well for a rich physics program with high precision forward spectrometers at the lhc .",
