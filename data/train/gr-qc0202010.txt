    "in four - dimensional general relativity as formulated by einstein , the singularity theorems tell us that the big bang was a unique birth event for a universe whose matter is of the conventional sort and obeys the energy conditions @xcite .",

    "the associated process of mass generation can either be described at the particle level by quantum field theory or at the macroscopic level by classical theory @xcite .",
    "the early stages of standard cosmology may also be modified by the effects of quantum gravity and quantum tunneling @xcite . in this regard , the appropriate formalism in 4d for early times can be investigated by considering the problem in 5d @xcite .",

    "there has recently been renewed interest in 5d manifolds of the type used originally in kaluza - klein theory @xcite .",
    "this is partly because of the resurrection of campbell s theorem , which ensures a perfect local embedding of a 4d einstein space in a 5d kaluza - klein space @xcite ; and partly because of the implications of higher - dimensional approaches such as superstrings and supergravity @xcite as well as string and membrane theory @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have revisited the problem of embedding 4d frw metrics in 5d minkowski space with an eye towards determining the geometrical structure of the big bang @xcite . for the standard spatially - flat ( @xmath2 )",

    "we have not inserted any matter into the 5d manifold by hand , as is commonly done in the brane - world / thin - shell formalism where the 5d stress - energy is a discontinuous , distribution - valued tensor field .",
    "it is for this reason that we call the matter described by @xmath34 induced ; rather than being inserted into the einstein equations as an external source for the gravitational field , the matter distribution is fixed by the morphology of the @xmath5 surfaces and the higher - dimensional geometry .",
    "the equation of state of the induced matter is @xmath37 which is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 in the metric ( [ 5d metric ] ) . for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which describes the late ( dust ) universe . for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 so @xmath44 , which describes the early ( radiation ) universe . that these quantities are the same as they are in the 4d frw models should not surprise us , as this could be inferred from campbell s theorem @xcite .",

    "this is easily verified by examining the congruence of comoving @xmath49 paths in the 4-geometry described by ( [ 4d metric ] ) .",
    "just like in conventional frw cosmology , the proper distance between adjacent paths will increase at an accelerating pace if the deceleration parameter , @xmath50 is negative .",
    "we therefore conclude that models with @xmath51 describe inflationary situations where the cosmological fluid has repulsive properties , while models with @xmath52 have ordinary gravitating matter .",
    "note that we exclude models with @xmath53 because they imply a contracting universe .    as a quick aside",

    "if @xmath89 , then we will end up at the 5d point @xmath90 , @xmath91 , which is different from the caustic in the @xmath80 congruence .",

    "is given by @xmath120 , so that the strong energy condition reads @xmath121 where @xmath122 is some timelike 2-velocity .",
    "hence , if @xmath123 then the strong energy condition is violated in 2d .",
    "this implies that the 2d gravitational density of the matter is less than zero , which in turn means that the relative velocity between neighboring timelike geodesics is increasing in magnitude by raychaudhuri s equation .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath48 discussed in subsection [ sec : ponce ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have found out that the local geometry around regular points on @xmath5  for a given value of @xmath7  is determined by whether or not the model represents a universe with ordinary or inflationary matter . in the former case the regular points are elliptical , in the latter case they are hyperbolic .      in the previous two subsections , we have discussed the properties of singular and regular points on @xmath5 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the global properties of the hypersurfaces , with an eye to determining which portion of @xmath8 they inhabit . in other words , we want to know what part of the @xmath8 manifold is covered by the @xmath126 coordinates .",

    "we note that the last case is based on classical field theory but bears a striking resemblance to computer - generated models of stochastic inflation @xcite based on quantum field theory .",
    "one of the most interesting features of figures [ fig : threehalves ]  [ fig : many ] is that the constant-@xmath61 cross sections @xmath183 of the @xmath5 hypersurfaces are very nearly closed . we will now demonstrate that the finite amount of space between the lower edges of the surfaces depicted in the figures is a result of the requirement that @xmath184 , which is imposed by limitations in machine arithmetic .",

    "( [ holy grail ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath5 itself must approach the @xmath190 plane as @xmath9",
    ". therefore , the @xmath144 lines must approach some subset of the @xmath191 null line @xmath192 as @xmath9 , which we denote by the intersection of @xmath192 and @xmath5 : @xmath193 .",
    "in other words , the finite gaps shown in the figures are an artifact from numerical calculations .",
    "this raises a puzzling and subtle issue .",
    "the @xmath144 curves approach a line in 5d at @xmath9 , yet the coordinate transformation ( [ tl transformation ] ) suggests that the @xmath86 `` line '' is really a point in 5d for any finite value of @xmath77 .",
    "is the big bang a point - like or line - like event in 5d ?",
    "several authors have appreciated this problem in the past .",
    "lynden - bell et al .",
    "present an embedding diagram of a spatially - flat frw model with @xmath194 , which is equivalent to our model 1 shown in figure [ fig : threehalves ] @xcite .",
    "their plot is qualitatively similar to ours , and they identify the half of @xmath192 satisfying @xmath139 with the 4d big bang .",
    "this is contrary to the conclusion of rindler , who demonstrates that open frw models may be completely foliated by spacelike 3-surfaces of finite volume @xcite .",
    "the volume of these hypersurfaces tends to zero as they approach the initial singularity , which leads to the idea that the big bang is a point - like event .",
    "we will now demonstrate that both of these views are in some sense mathematically correct ; the location of the big bang depends on one s definition of the initial singularity .",
    "one such definition might be the locus of points defined by the positions of the fundamental comoving observers in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "this is in the spirit of the definition of a singular spacetime as a manifold containing one or more incomplete timelike geodesics ; i.e.  timelike geodesics which are inextendible in at least one direction , or have a finite affine length @xcite .",
    "the incomplete geodesics on @xmath5 are clearly the comoving trajectories of the @xmath80 congruence , which has a fundamental caustic as @xmath93 . for @xmath82 ,",
    "it is obvious from figures [ fig : threehalves ]  [ fig : twothirds ] that it is impossible to extend these geodesics past the caustic at @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath80 geodesics are also incomplete for @xmath195 , although this is hard to see from figures [ fig : oneoverthirty ] and [ fig : many ] because the caustic is at null infinity . however , we note that the proper time interval along a comoving path between the initial caustic and any point on @xmath5 is finite , which establishes that the @xmath80 curves are incomplete . in both cases ,",
    "the comoving paths radiate from a point in 5d . by identifying the location where the @xmath80 congruences `` begin '' with the initial singularity ,",
    "we conclude that the big bang is a point - like event in higher dimensions .",
    "however , the definition of the big bang need not be tied to the properties of inextendible timelike geodesics .",
    "we could instead elect to define the location of the big bang as the locus of points on @xmath5 where curvature scalars diverge .",
    "this definition is in the spirit of using quantities like the kretschmann scalar to distinguish between coordinate and genuine singularities in the schwarzschild spacetime ( among others ) . for the present case ,",
    "we note that the copernican principle built into the frw solutions demands that curvature scalars on @xmath5 must be constant along @xmath144 isochrones .",
    "this is evidenced by the kretschmann scalar ( [ kretschmann ] ) and the minkowski gaussian curvature ( [ minkowski gaussian ] ) , both of which demonstrate no dependence on @xmath77 . as @xmath93 ,",
    "both of these scalars diverge and the @xmath144 isochrones approach @xmath193 .",
    "this would seem to suggest the line @xmath193 is the location of a curvature scalar singularity on @xmath5 . by the definition mentioned at the head of this paragraph , this implies the big bang is a line - like event in higher dimensions .",
    "there are two possible objections to this conclusion : firstly , the idea that @xmath5 is singular along @xmath196 is somewhat counterintuitive , because the hypersurfaces shown in the figures appear to smoothly approach @xmath192 as @xmath9 .",
    "secondly , we observe that the @xmath197 coordinates do not actually cover @xmath198 , which makes the @xmath1-dependent arguments of the last paragraph suspect .",
    "this is easily seen by noting that the induced metric ( [ 4d metric ] ) is singular at @xmath71 and @xmath199 on @xmath193 from equations ( [ r ] ) and ( [ t plus l ] ) .",
    "the situation is analogous to the failure of spherical coordinates to cover the @xmath200-axis in @xmath70 .",
    "for these two reasons , it would be a good idea to confirm the presence of a curvature singularity along @xmath193 in a manner independent of the @xmath197 coordinates .",
    "this can be accomplished using the well - known extrinsic curvature formalism .",
    "restoring the @xmath68 and @xmath69 coordinates , let us now work in the 5d @xmath201 system with @xmath202 and @xmath203 as defined in ( [ advanced / retarded ] ) . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the line @xmath193 is approached by taking the @xmath204 limit ( recall that @xmath205 for all of the hypersurfaces ) .",
    "we can define @xmath5 in this space by @xmath206 where @xmath207 is given by the righthand side of equation ( [ holy grail ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath4 is viewed a parameter to be kept constant . a vector normal to @xmath5",
    "is then given by @xmath208 if @xmath5 is embedded in minkowski space , then we find that @xmath209 where we have used ( [ holy grail ] ) to eliminate @xmath210 , which means that @xmath211 is implicitly evaluated on @xmath5 .",
    "we note that @xmath212 is clearly null for @xmath213 , which corresponds to @xmath193 , and spacelike for @xmath214 , which corresponds to the rest of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the components of the unit normal to @xmath5 , given by @xmath215 diverge as @xmath204 .",
    "since the 5d manifold is flat , the riemann tensor on @xmath5 is related to the extrinsic curvature 4-tensor in the following manner : @xmath216 where @xmath217 are vectors spanning @xmath5 and @xmath218 are the ( arbitrary ) coordinates used on @xmath5 . because of the bad behaviour of @xmath219 at @xmath213 , we fully expect the extrinsic curvature and the 4d riemann tensor to be singular along @xmath193 .",
    "indeed , our extrinsic curvature formalism is not really defined at @xmath220 , so we must again be content with a limiting argument .",
    "we can calculate various curvature scalars composed from @xmath221 ( or equivalently @xmath222 ) and show that they diverge as @xmath204 .",
    "for example , consider @xmath223 which can be established from the definition of @xmath221 and use of the induced metric @xmath224 .",
    "for @xmath225 , we obtain via computer : @xmath226 therefore , @xmath5 has a curvature scalar singularity at all points with @xmath213 ; i.e.  all along the line @xmath198 .",
    "this confirms the conclusion of the @xmath189 limiting argument used above .",
    "it is interesting to note that this curvature singularity is due to @xmath212 becoming null along @xmath193 , as opposed to any lack of `` smoothness '' of the surface at @xmath213 . to see this",
    ", we can consider the embedding of @xmath5 in euclidean space .",
    "then , the norm of @xmath212 along @xmath198 ( i.e.  @xmath220 ) is @xmath227.\\ ] ] unlike the minkowski case , @xmath211 only vanishes at a single point on @xmath193 .",
    "we also obtain via computer @xmath228 where @xmath229 . for @xmath82",
    ", we get a curvature singularity for @xmath230 , which is the position of the caustic in figures [ fig : threehalves ]  [ fig : twothirds ] . interestingly enough",
    ", for @xmath96 we see no singularity at all , despite the fact that @xmath211 vanishes at @xmath230 .",
    "this is because the components of @xmath212 themselves vanish at @xmath230 , which means that the unit normal @xmath231 is finite and well defined ( as may easily be verified ) .",
    "this is in agreement with figures [ fig : oneoverthirty ] and [ fig : many ] , which suggests that @xmath5 is smooth at the origin .",
    "we have also investigated the behaviour of the full @xmath221 4-tensor evaluated along @xmath193 in @xmath232 and confirmed that the components are in general well - behaved , except at @xmath233 for @xmath82 .",
    "this reinforces our conclusion that the only euclidean curvature singularity on @xmath5 is at @xmath230 for @xmath138 .",
    "the chief difference between the minkowski and euclidean embeddings is that @xmath231 is infinite along @xmath193 in the former case , while in the latter scenario the unit normal is well defined all over @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we can attribute the minkowski line - like curvature singularity on @xmath5 to the divergence of the unit normal , and not to the lack of smoothness of the surface along @xmath193 .    in conclusion , the geometric structure of the big bang in 5d",
    "depends on one s definition of a singularity .",
    "if a singular location on @xmath5 is taken to be a place beyond which timelike geodesics can not be extended , then the big bang is a point - like event in 5d .",
    "if a singular location is taken to be a place where curvature scalars on @xmath5 diverge , then the big bang manifests itself as a line in 5d .",
    "the distinction can be elucidated by asking whether an observer at @xmath234 at time @xmath235 is ever in causal contact with points other than the @xmath80 caustic on @xmath193 .",
    "the trajectory of a light ray passing through @xmath236 at @xmath237 is easily found from the null geodesic condition applied to the 4d metric ( [ 4d metric ] ) : @xmath238 } { ( { \\alpha}-1)}.\\ ] ] substituting for @xmath77 in ( [ tl transformation ] ) and taking the @xmath9 limit , we find that light arriving at @xmath234 at any finite time @xmath239 must have come from @xmath94 for @xmath240 and @xmath241 , @xmath188 for @xmath242 .",
    "in other words , the only point on the @xmath193 line inside the cosmological horizon of @xmath234 is coincident with the position of the @xmath80 caustic .",
    "this is true for all reasonable values of @xmath7 and @xmath239 .",
    "because of isotropy , this must also be true for any finite value of @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , of all the points on @xmath5 where curvature scalars diverge , only the @xmath80 caustic is in causal contact with `` normal '' points on @xmath5 .",
    "_ in a real physical sense , this means that the geometric structure of the singularity that gives rise to the observable universe is point - like in 5d . _ information from the rest of the line - like singularity on @xmath5 can never reach us within a finite amount of time .",
    "we feel that this is the best possible resolution to the issue of the geometric structure of the big bang in five dimensions .",
    "the coordinate transformation ( [ tl transformation ] ) between the original ponce de leon metric ( [ 5d metric ] ) and the minkowski metric ( [ 5d minkowski ] ) is undefined for @xmath7 = 0 , @xmath246 , and 1 . of these three possibilities , only the @xmath245 case leads to a non - singular 5d metric tensor ( [ 5d metric ] ) in the @xmath247 coordinate system .",
    "we will first discuss the cases for which the ponce de leon cosmologies themselves are ill - defined and then turn to the highly - symmetric @xmath245 case .",
    "in the limit @xmath243 , equation ( [ density and pressure ] ) implies that the equation of state of the induced matter is that of de sitter space , namely @xmath248 .",
    "it is well known that the scale factor of the de sitter universe grows exponentially in time , in contrast to the scale factor of the ponce de leon cosmologies which can only grow as fast as a power law .",
    "therefore , it makes sense that de sitter space corresponds to the @xmath243 limit of ( [ 5d metric ] ) since it is for this case that the scale factor @xmath249 grows faster than any ( finite ) power of @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath244 case has an equation of state @xmath250 , which represents matter with no gravitational density by equation ( [ gravitational ] ) .",
    "the limiting value of the scale factor is @xmath251 in this case , which is consistent with @xmath252 in equation ( [ deceleration ] ) .",
    "this limit clearly corresponds to the empty milne universe , which is known to have scale factor linear in time and matter with @xmath250 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath253 would correspond to the osculating paraboloid of @xmath5 being cylindrical , which is precisely the situation intermediate to the @xmath38 case shown in figure [ fig : threehalves ] and the @xmath153 case shown in figure [ fig : twothirds ] .",
    "now , as mentioned above , the @xmath245 cosmology is the only case for which 5d metric ( [ 5d metric ] ) is well defined , but the transformation ( [ tl transformation ] ) is not .",
    "this cosmology represents the case intermediate between universes with a @xmath80 caustic at @xmath134 ( figures [ fig : threehalves ]  [ fig : twothirds ] ) and those with a @xmath80 caustic at null infinity ( figures [ fig : oneoverthirty ] and [ fig : many ] ) .",
    "the line element by ( [ 5d metric ] ) is @xmath254 by @xmath255 this gives a metric with signature @xmath256 , so the 4d spacetime is of the type used in euclidean quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "a further change @xmath257 gives back ( [ onehalf ] ) .",
    "the metric is also unchanged for @xmath258 with one or the other of @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "however , ( [ onehalf ] ) with the last term taken with reversed sign is not a solution of the field equations @xmath29 , as may be verified by computer .",
    "it is therefore not like the so - called `` two - time '' 5d metrics with signature @xmath261 which satisfy @xmath29 and have been applied to vacuum waves @xcite and cosmological inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "it can also be mentioned that the ponce de leon metric ( [ 5d metric ] ) does not satisfy @xmath29 if the last term is taken with reversed sign .",
    "thus while ( [ 5d metric ] ) and ( [ onehalf ] ) satisfy the field equations with a space - like extra dimension , they do not with a time - like extra dimension , which raises the possibility of testing the signature of higher - dimensional theory .",
    "the model ( [ onehalf ] ) also shares with ( [ 5d metric ] ) the property that the 5d riemann - chistoffel tensor is @xmath75 .",
    "this may be verified by computer .",
    "the scale factor in ( [ onehalf ] ) varies as @xmath262 , which is faster than standard frw models .",
    "it contains 4d matter which by ( [ density and pressure ] ) with @xmath263 is a perfect fluid with density @xmath264 and pressure @xmath265 .",
    "the equation of state is therfore @xmath266 .",
    "the gravitational density ( [ gravitational ] ) is @xmath267 , so the model is inflationary .",

    "the ponce de leon models provide a concrete realization of cosmology in 5d because they embed the frw solutions of general relativity along with their properties of matter .",
    "mathematically , a smooth local embedding of 4d solutions with a finite energy - momentum tensor in a class of 5d solutions of the vacuum field equations follows from campbell s theorem .",
    "physically , the 4d solutions exist on hypersurfaces of the 5d manifold , and represent matter - filled spacetimes because the 4d space is curved , even though in the ponce de leon case the 5d space is flat .",

    "one of our main results is to use the algebraic transformation ( [ tl transformation ] ) from the models in frw coordinates ( [ 5d metric ] ) to minkowski coordinates ( [ 5d minkowski ] ) to obtain pictures of the big bang .",
    "figures [ fig : threehalves ]  [ fig : many ] elucidate the structure of several types of 4d universes by showing them as 2-surfaces embedded in a 3d space .",
