    "the distribution of objects in the universe displays a high degree of organization , which in current models is due to primordial fluctuations in density which were laid down at very early times and amplified by the process of gravitational instability .",
    "characterizing the evolution of this large - scale structure is a central theme of cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "in addition to allowing us to understand the structure itself , large - scale structure studies offer an incisive tool for probing cosmology and particle physics and sets the context for our modern understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . since the pioneering studies of @xcite and the first cfa redshift survey @xcite , galaxy redshift surveys have played a key role in this enterprise , and ever larger surveys have provided increasing insight and ever tighter constraints on cosmological models .",
    "this paper presents the first measurements of the clustering of massive galaxies from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on a sample of galaxy redshifts observed during the period january through july 2010 .",
    "we demonstrate that boss is efficiently obtaining redshifts of some of the most luminous galaxies at @xmath6 , and has already become the largest such redshift survey ever undertaken .",
    "the high bias and number density of these objects ( described below ) make them ideal tracers of large - scale structure , and suggest that boss will make a significant impact on many science questions including a determination of the cosmic distance scale , the growth of structure and the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we briefly describe the boss survey and observations , and define the sample we focus on in this paper .",
    "our clustering results are described in  [ sec : clustering ] and interpreted in the framework of the halo model in ",
    "[ sec : hod ] , where we also compare to previous work on the clustering of massive galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results in  [ sec : discussion ] , while some technical details on the construction of our mock catalogs are relegated to an appendix . throughout this paper when measuring distances we refer to comoving separations , measured in @xmath7mpc with @xmath8 .",
    "we convert redshifts to distances , assuming a @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is the same cosmology as assumed for the n - body simulations from which we make our mock catalogs ( see appendix [ app : mocks ] ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) mapped nearly a quarter of the sky using the dedicated sloan foundation 2.5 m telescope @xcite located at apache point observatory in new mexico .",
    "a drift - scanning mosaic ccd camera @xcite imaged the sky in five photometric bandpasses @xcite to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 .",
    "the imaging data were processed through a series of pipelines that perform astrometric calibration @xcite , photometric reduction @xcite , and photometric calibration @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite .",

    "the targets are assigned to tiles of diameter @xmath16 using an adaptive tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "aluminum plates are drilled with holes corresponding to the positions of objects on each tile , and manually plugged with optical fibers that feed a pair of double spectrographs .",
    "these spectrographs are significantly upgraded from those used by sdss - i / ii @xcite , with improved chips with better red response , higher throughput gratings , 1,000 fibers ( instead of 640 ) and a @xmath17 entrance aperture ( was @xmath18 ) .",
    "the spectra cover the range @xmath19  to @xmath20 , at a resolution of about 2,000 .",
    "boss makes use of luminous galaxies selected from the multi - color sdss imaging to probe large - scale structure at intermediate redshift ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "these galaxies are among the most luminous galaxies in the universe and trace a large cosmological volume while having high enough number density to ensure that shot - noise is not a dominant contributor to the clustering variance .",
    "the majority of the galaxies have old stellar systems whose prominent @xmath22  break in their spectral energy distributions makes them relatively easy to select in multi - color data .    the strategy",
    "behind , and details of , our target selection are covered in detail in padmanabhan et al .",

    "cuts in color - magnitude space allow a roughly volume - limited sample of luminous galaxies to be selected , and partitioned into broad redshift bins .",
    "briefly , we follow the sdss - i / ii procedure described in @xcite and define a `` rotated '' combination of colors @xmath23 .",
    "the sample we analyze in this paper ( the so - called `` cmass sample '' since it is approximately stellar mass limited ) is defined via @xmath24 where magnitude cuts use `` cmodel magnitudes '' and colors are defined with `` model magnitudes '' , except for @xmath25 which is the magnitude in the @xmath17 spectroscopic fiber ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for definitions of the magnitudes and further discussion ) .",
    "there are two additional cuts to reduce stellar contamination , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these cuts isolate the @xmath0 , high mass galaxies .",
    "the @xmath28 constraint is approximately a cut in absolute magnitude or stellar mass , with @xmath29 closely tracking redshift for these galaxies .",
    "as discussed in detail in padmanabhan et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , the slope of the @xmath28 cut is set to parallel the track of a passively evolving , constant stellar mass galaxy as determined from the population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to an approximately stellar mass limited sample .",
    "we restrict ourselves to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nbar ] ) .",
    "note that our selection gives the majority of the galaxies within @xmath30 of the median  this has the advantage of making the analysis relatively straightforward but means we need to combine with other samples to obtain leverage in redshift .",
    "a comparison of the cuts defining this sample with other , similar , samples in the literature will be presented in padmanabhan et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    ". in general boss goes both fainter and bluer than the earlier samples , targeting `` luminous galaxies '' not `` luminous red galaxies '' .    the distribution of absolute ( @xmath31-band ) magnitude for the sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maghist ] , where we see that all of the cmass galaxies are intrinsically very luminous .",
    "using the modeling of maraston et al .",
    "( in preparation ) on the boss spectra we find the median stellar mass of the sample is @xmath32 . while the detailed numbers depend on assumptions about e.g.  the initial mass function , these galaxies are at the very high mass end of the stellar mass function at this redshift for any reasonable assumptions .",
    "the clustering measurements in this paper are based on the data taken by boss up to end of july 2010 , which includes 120,000 galaxies over 1,600 deg@xmath33 of sky .",
    "however , the data prior to january 2010 were taken in commissioning mode and little of those data are of survey quality .",
    "once we trim the data to contiguous regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sky ] ) with high redshift completeness and select galaxies at @xmath0 we are left with @xmath34 galaxies , covering @xmath35 square degrees , which we have used in our analysis .    the sky coverage of our sample can be seen in figure [ fig : sky ] .",
    "we view the data as comprising three regions of the sky , hereafter referred to as a , b and c ( see figure ) .",
    "galaxies in these regions are separated from those in any other region by several hundred mpc , and we shall consider them independent .",
    "convenient `` rectangular '' boundaries to the regions are @xmath36 these boundaries yield widths ( heights ) of 600 ( 700 ) , 2600 ( 270 ) and 1600 ( 800 ) @xmath7mpc respectively at @xmath6 . as we shall discuss below",
    ", the data are consistent with having the same clustering and redshift distribution in all three regions .",
    "we compute several two - point , configuration - space clustering statistics in this paper .",
    "the basis for all of these calculations is the two - point galaxy correlation function on a two - dimensional grid of pair separations parallel and perpendicular to the line - of - sight : @xmath37 .",
    "to estimate the counts expected for unclustered objects while accounting for the complex survey geometry , we generate random catalogs with the detailed radial and angular selection functions of the sample but with @xmath38 the number of points .",
    "numerous tests have confirmed that the survey selection function factorizes into an angular and a redshift piece .",
    "the redshift selection function can be taken into account by distributing the randoms according to the observed redshift distribution of the sample .",
    "the completeness on the sky is determined from the fraction of target galaxies in a sector for which we obtained a high - quality redshift , with the sectors being areas of the sky covered by a unique set of spectroscopic tiles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the mangle software @xcite to track the angular completeness . in computing the redshift completeness",
    "we omit galaxies for which a redshift was already known from an earlier survey from both the target and success lists , and then later randomly sample such galaxies with the resulting completeness in constructing the input catalog .",
    "since very few of our targets at @xmath0 have existing redshifts this is a very small correction . not all of the spectra taken resulted in a reliable redshift , and the failure probability has angular structure due to hardware limitations . these result in spatial signal - to - noise fluctuations in observations .",
    "we find no evidence that this failure is redshift dependent - low and high redshift failure regions have the same redshift distribution .",
    "we therefore apply a small angular correction for this spatial structure by up - weighting galaxies based on the signal - to - noise of each spectrum , and the probability of redshift measurement .",
    "this is a small correction and only affects our results at the percent level . to avoid issues arising from small - number statistics we only keep sectors with area larger than @xmath39sr , or approximately @xmath40 sq .",
    "deg . at the observed mean density ( @xmath41 )",
    "we expect several tens of galaxies in any such region , enabling us to reliably determine the redshift completeness of @xmath42 galaxies have redshifts the most likely completeness is @xmath43 , the mean is @xmath44 and the variance on @xmath45 is @xmath46/[(n+2)^2(n+3)]$ ] .",
    "for example if @xmath47 and @xmath48 the error on @xmath45 is approximately @xmath3 . for @xmath49",
    "the error is under @xmath50 .",
    "unless the scatter is somehow correlated with the signal these uncertainties are negligible .",
    "in fact , we find that ignoring the exact value of the completeness in constructing our random catalog only slightly alters our final @xmath51 . ] .",
    "we trim the final area to all sectors with completeness greater than 75% , producing our final sample of 44,000 galaxies , distributed as 5,000 in region a , 14,000 in region b and 24,000 in region c. after the cut the median , galaxy - weighted completeness is 88% , 84% and 88% in regions a , b and c respectively .",
    "we estimate @xmath37 using the @xcite estimator @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are suitably normalized numbers of ( weighted ) data - data , data - random and random - random pairs in bins of @xmath56 .",
    "we experimented with two sets of weights , one to correct for fiber collisions ( described below ) and one to reduce the variance of the estimator .",
    "the latter was @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean density at redshift @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a model for the volume - integrated redshift - space correlation function within @xmath61 .",
    "we approximated @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath63 and took @xmath64mpc .",
    "the details of the weighting scheme did not affect our final result on the scales of interest to us here  in fact dropping this weight altogether gave comparable results and so we neglect this weight in what follows .",
    "we are unable to obtain redshifts for approximately 7% of the galaxies due to fiber collisions  no two fibers on any given observation can be placed closer than @xmath65 . at @xmath6",
    "the @xmath65 exclusion corresponds to @xmath66mpc .",
    "where possible we obtain redshifts for the collided galaxies in regions where plates overlap , but the remaining exclusion must be account for .",
    "we correct for the impact of this by ( a ) restricting our analysis to relatively large scales and ( b ) up - weighting galaxy - galaxy pairs in the analysis with angular separations smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "the weight is derived by comparing the angular correlation function of the entire photometric sample with that of the galaxies for which we obtained redshifts @xcite .",
    "this ratio is very close to unity above @xmath65 but significantly depressed below this scale .",
    "note that in our situation there is a close correspondence between angular separation and transverse separation since our survey volume is a relatively narrow shell with reasonably large radius , so the number of pairs for which this correction is appreciable is quite small .",
    "contours of the 2d correlation function for our @xmath1 galaxy sample are shown in figure [ fig : xirz ] .",
    "note the characteristic elongation in the @xmath67 direction at small @xmath68 ( fingers - of - god ) and squashing at large @xmath68 ( super - cluster infall ) .    to mitigate the effects of redshift space distortions we follow standard practice and compute from @xmath37 the projected correlation function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath69 in practice we integrate to @xmath70mpc , which is sufficiently large to include almost all correlated pairs .",
    "we also compute the angularly averaged , redshift space correlation function , @xmath71 , and the cross - correlation between the cmass sample selected from the imaging and the spectroscopic samples , @xmath72 .",
    "for all of these measures the full covariance matrix is computed from a set of mock catalogs based on a halo - occupation distribution ( hod ) modeling of the data (  [ sec : hod ] and appendix [ app : mocks ] ) .",
    "we now discuss each of the clustering measurements in turn , beginning with the real - space clustering .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our galaxies populate a broad range of halo masses , with an approximate power - law dependence of the mean number of galaxies per halo with halo mass for massive halos and a broad roll - off at lower halo masses .",
    "the low mass behavior is driven by the amplitude of the large - scale clustering in combination with the relatively high number density of our sample and encodes information about the scaling of the central galaxy luminosity with halo mass and its distribution .",
    "we find that the halos with masses @xmath73 contain on average one of our massive galaxies . at these redshifts",
    "such halos are quite highly biased ( see below ) , corresponding to galaxy groups , and we expect @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the linear growth rate , leading to an approximately constant clustering amplitude with redshift .",
    "the majority of our galaxies are central galaxies residing in @xmath2 halos , but a non - negligible fraction are satellites which live primarily in halos @xmath76 times more massive .",
    "the width of this `` plateau '' ( @xmath77 ) is smaller than that found for less luminous systems at lower redshift , though it continues the trends seen in @xcite for plateau width and satellite fraction as a function of luminosity .",
    "this increase in the satellite fraction is driving the visibility of the fingers - of - god in the correlation function ( figure [ fig : xirz ] ) and the small - scale upturn in @xmath78 .",
    "an alternative view of the halo occupation is presented in figure [ fig : hodcum ] , which shows the probability that a galaxy in our sample is hosted by a halo of mass @xmath79 .",
    "note the broad range of halo masses probed by our galaxies , and the low probability of finding one of our galaxies in very high mass halos  which is a consequence of the sparsity of such halos at this redshift .",
    "the n - body simulations can also be used to infer the scale - dependence of the bias , @xmath80^{1/2}$ ] , for our best - fitting halo model .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : bofr ] , where we see that above @xmath81mpc the bias approaches a constant , @xmath4 .",
    "for our cosmology the linear growth factor at @xmath82 is @xmath83 so @xmath84 and this is assumed constant across our redshift range .",
    "this is very similar to the results obtained for photometric lrg samples at comparable redshifts @xcite .",
    "the rapid rise of @xmath85 at very small scales is expected , since it is well known that these galaxies exhibit an almost power - law correlation function at small scales while the non - linear @xmath86 is predicted to fall below a power - law at small @xmath31 .",
    "( most galaxy pairs on these scales are central - satellite pairs , whereas for the dark matter there is no such distinction so @xmath87 is the convolution of the halo radial profile with itself . )",
    "the feature in @xmath85 at a few mpc occurs at the transition between the 1- and 2-halo contributions , i.e.  pairs of galaxies that lie within a single dark matter halo vs.  those which lie in separate halos , while the rise at slightly larger scales comes from the scale - dependence of the halo bias .",
    "note that the combination of the high clustering amplitude and number density makes this sample particularly powerful for probing large - scale structure at @xmath6 .",
    "finally , using the best - fitting hod model from the chain and a series of n - body simulations we generate mock catalogs as described in more detail in appendix [ app : mocks ] .",
    "these are passed through the observational masks and cuts in order to mimic the observations and can be analyzed in the same manner to generate a set of mock measurements from which we compute covariance matrices and other statistical quantities .",
    "we match the redshift distribution of the sample to our constant - number - density simulation boxes by randomly subsampling the galaxies as a function of redshift ( with a 100% sampling at the peak near @xmath88 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption , earlier , that the hod describes a single population of objects and the @xmath89 reflects observational selection effects .",
    "we obtain similar hods fitting to the thinner redshift slices which lends credence to this view .",
    "the baryon spectroscopic oscillation survey is in the process of taking spectra for 1.5 million luminous galaxies and 150,000 quasars to make a precision determination of the scale of baryon oscillations and to study the growth of structure and the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "we have presented measurements of the clustering of 44,000 massive galaxies at @xmath0 from the first semester of boss data , showing that boss is performing well and that the galaxies we are targeting have properties in line with expectations @xcite .",
    "the cmass sample at @xmath6 has a large - scale bias of @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bofr ] ) , and a number density several times higher than the earlier , spectroscopic lrg sample of @xcite , making it an ideal sample for studying large - scale structure .",
    "the majority of our cmass galaxies are central galaxies residing in @xmath2 halos , but a non - negligible fraction are satellites which live primarily in halos @xmath76 times more massive .",
    "the data through july 2010 do not cover enough volume to robustly detect the acoustic peak in the correlation function in this sample , one of the science goals of boss . while no definitive detection is possible at present ,",
    "the error bars are anticipated to shrink rapidly as we collect more redshifts ; boss should be able to constrain the acoustic scale at @xmath0 within the next year , with the constraints becoming increasingly tight as the survey progresses .",

    "briefly , each simulation employs an updated version of the treepm code described in @xcite to evolve @xmath93 equal mass ( @xmath94 ) particles in a periodic cube of side length @xmath95mpc with a plummer equivalent smoothing of @xmath96kpc .",
    "the initial conditions were generated by displacing particles from a regular grid using second order lagrangian perturbation theory at @xmath97 where the rms displacement is @xmath3 of the mean inter - particle spacing .",
    "this treepm code has been compared to a number of other codes and shown to perform well for such simulations @xcite .",
    "recently the code has been modified to use a hybrid mpi+openmp approach which is particularly efficient for modern clusters .    for each output we found dark matter halos using the friends of friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath98 times the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "this partitions the particles into equivalence classes roughly bounded by isodensity contours of @xmath99 the mean density .",
    "the position of the most - bound particle , the center of mass velocity and a random subset of the member particles are stored for each halo and used as input into the halo occupation distribution modeling and mock catalogs . throughout",
    "we use the sum of the masses of the particles linked by the fof algorithm as our basic definition of halo mass , except when quoting @xmath100 in  [ sec : hod ] where we use spherical over - density ( so ) masses to facilitate comparison with other work .",
    "note we do not run a so finder to define new groups .",
    "we use the fof halo catalog , only computing a different mass for each fof halo . in order to compute these so masses",

    "all of the mock observational samples are assumed to be iso - redshift , and `` static '' outputs are used as input to the modeling .",

    "once a set of hod parameter values has been chosen , we populate each halo in a given simulation with mock `` galaxies '' .",
    "the hod provides the probabilities that a halo will contain a central galaxy and the number of satellites .",
    "the central galaxy is placed at the position of the most bound particle in the halo , and we randomly draw dark matter particles to represent the satellites , assuming that the satellite galaxies trace the mass profile within halos .",
    "this approach has the advantage of retaining any alignments between the halo material , the filamentary large - scale structure and the velocity field .    since the observational geometry is in some cases highly elongated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sky ] ) , we use volume remapping @xcite on the periodic cubes to encompass many realizations of the sample within each box .",
    "the mock galaxies are then observed in a way analogous to the actual sample , with the completeness mask and redshift cuts applied to generate several hundred `` mock surveys '' .",
    "( overall we have @xmath103 mock surveys , divided into @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 mock surveys of regions a , b and c respectively",
    ". however they are not all completely independent as we have only @xmath107 times as much volume in the simulations as in the largest region , c. ) for technical reasons , and since it only affects the smallest scale @xmath78 point , we do not model fiber collisions .",
    "instead we increase the errors for that point by the square root of the ratio of the pair counts in the photometric sample to that in the spectroscopic sample ( i.e.  the same correction applied to the data - data pairs in computing @xmath37 ) .",
    "this correction is appropriate in the limit that the error is dominated by poisson counting statistics .",
    "the covariance matrices for the clustering statistics are obtained from the mocks , and the entire procedure ( reconstructing the best - fit with the new covariance matrix , recomputing the mock catalogs and recomputing the clustering ) is iterated until convergence .",
