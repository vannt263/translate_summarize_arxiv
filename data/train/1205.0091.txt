    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are the prime representatives of magnetars  a class of neutron stars that are thought to be powered by the decay of their superstrong magnetic fields ( b@xmath910@xmath410@xmath10  g , duncan & thompson 1992 ) . aside from emitting energetic bursts in hard x - rays and soft gamma rays ,",
    "magnetars are bright x - ray sources ( l@xmath11@xmath910@xmath1210@xmath13 erg  s@xmath7 ) , emitting pulsed x - rays either persistently or episodically ( see woods & thompson 2006 and mereghetti 2008 for detailed reviews ) .",
    "x - ray observations of most of sgrs and axps over the last thirty years have shown that these sources are not steady emitters , exhibiting flux variability generally in conjunction with bursting activities ( see e.g. , rea & esposito 2011 ) .",
    "all known sgrs have been discovered when they went into a bursting phase , during which they emit repeated energetic bursts in soft gamma - rays .",
    "sgr  0526@xmath066 was not an exception : it was discovered as the first sgr with an extremely bright gamma - ray burst on 1979 march 5 that was followed by a tail emission clearly pulsating at 8.1 s ( mazets et al .",
    "the burst location is within the supernova remnant , n49 in the large magellanic cloud ( evans et al .",
    "the source exhibited 16 more bursts until 1983 april 5 with much lower intensity than that of the march 5th event ( aptekar et al .",
    "since then , no bursts have been detected from sgr  0526@xmath066 .",
    "due to its large distance and the fact that the source is embedded in a supernova remnant , spectral and timing studies of sgr  0526@xmath066 have been limited .",
    "the persistent x - ray source was identified with rosat , yielding the earliest view of the source as it is in burst quiescence ( rothschild , kulkarni & lingenfelter 1994 ) .",
    "sgr  0526@xmath066 has been the target of two chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) observations in 2000 and 2001 .",
    "thanks to the superb angular resolution of cxo , x - ray spectroscopy and timing investigations of the persistent source became possible .",
    "based on these observations , spin period of @xmath14  8.04 s was measured and a tentative p of @xmath14 6.5@xmath310@xmath6  s  s@xmath7 was inferred ( kulkarni et al .",
    "x - ray spectrum of the sgr  0526@xmath066 could be described well with the empirical model of an absorbed blackbody plus a power law component .",
    "the resulting power law index was much steeper than that of other sgrs , while it was similar to the power law indices of axps , which led kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to suggest that sgr  0526@xmath066 is in a transition from the sgr - like phase to an axp - like phase .",
    "sgr  0526@xmath066 and its associated supernova remnant , n49 was recently observed with xmm - newton .",
    "tiengo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported that the x - ray spectrum of the source does not show any significant changes compared to xmm - newton observations performed in 2000 and 2001 and sgr  0526@xmath066 is still a bright persistent source , emitting at an x - ray luminosity of @xmath14  4@xmath310@xmath15  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "very recently , park et al . (",
    "2012 ) provided an in depth analysis of the supernova remnant using four chandra observations that were obtained in 2009 .",
    "they refined the sedov age of n49 as @xmath16  @xmath14  4800 yr . park et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also analysed the x - ray spectra of sgr  0526@xmath066  using phenomenological models , such as the sum of a blackbody and a power - law or two blackbody models .",
    "they find that the x - ray flux of sgr  0526@xmath066  varied by about 15 % between the observations performed in 2000/2001 and 2009 . further including archival rosat observations they detect a decay in x - ray flux by about @xmath14  20 - 30% for the last 17 years .    here",
    ", we report on our systematic analysis of all archival chandra observations of sgr  0526@xmath066  to unveil the x - ray spectral characteristics of the source when it is in deep burst quiescence .",
    "we model the x - ray spectra with the surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering ( stems ) model ( gver et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2011 ) , to determine the effective surface temperature , the surface magnetic field strength , and the long term x - ray flux of sgr  0526@xmath066 .",
    "we also perform timing analysis to construct the spin period evolution of the source and obtain the inferred dipole magnetic field strength .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the expected cooling trends from magnetized neutron stars .",
    "we list the observations used in our study in table [ obs ] .",
    "note that there are two more chandra observations that contain sgr  0526@xmath066 in the field of view .",
    "however , the source was observed off - axis by about 4 \" in one of the observations ( obsid : 1041 ) .",
    "the effects of vignetting do not allow a reliable source extraction without any contribution from the supernova remnant .",
    "the other observation ( obsid : 2515 ) has only 7 ks of effective exposure , that is too short to provide high enough signal - to - noise x - ray spectrum .",
    "therefore , we exclude these two pointings from our investigations .",
    ".chandra observations of the sgr  0526@xmath066 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ timing ]",
    "we performed a systematic analysis of the archival chandra observations of sgr  0526@xmath066 . fitting the x - ray spectra with a strongly magnetized atmosphere model allowed us determine the strength of the surface magnetic field as @xmath17  g and the effective temperature as 0.355  kev .",
    "we also obtained the optical depth to resonant scattering in the magnetosphere , @xmath18=5.47 , and the average velocity of the magnetospheric particles , 0.52c .",
    "all these parameters remain constant over the course of nine years within uncertainties .    what has been observed to change over this interval",
    "is the source flux : it decreased by about 20% from 2000 to 2009 ( see also park et al .",
    "such a flux decay can result from a @xmath14  5 - 6% decrease in the surface temperature .",
    "this variation is comparable to the uncertainties in individual temperature measurements at the 1-@xmath19 level .",
    "therefore , we can not unambiguously rule out a variation in the temperature .",
    "nevertheless , no systematic variation in the best fit values of the surface temperature has been observed over the nine years .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the surface temperature of sgr  0526@xmath066  remained constant throughout this period .",
    "the decline in the observed flux can also be achieved with a decrease in the radius of the emitting region by about 10@xmath20 .",
    "we obtain through our spectral fits that the radius was about 13.3 km in 2000/2001 , and about 11.7 km in 2009 , assuming a distance 48.1 kpc ( macri et al .",
    "it is possible that the thermally emitting hot spot on the surface of the neutron star might still carry the effects of burst induced heating in the late 70s and early 80s and dissipates over time without going through a major change in its temperature .",
    "it is important to note that the large radius values we deduce from the spectral fits are in agreement with the very low rms pulsed fractions we inferred from the timing analysis .",
    "we determined the spin period history of sgr  0526@xmath066 , which is in accord with the results of tiengo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and derived the period derivative as 4.02@xmath310@xmath6  s  s@xmath7 . assuming that the spindown of the neutron star is due to a magnetic dipole braking , the inferred dipole magnetic field strength of the neutron star is calculated as @xmath14  5.7@xmath3 10@xmath4 g , which agrees with the surface magnetic field strength as found from the x - ray spectra using the stems model .",
    "making the same spindown assumption , we calculate the characteristic age of the pulsar as @xmath21  yr .",
    "this is comparable to , but somewhat lower than , the estimated sedov age of the supernova remnant , which is 4800  yr ( park et al .",
    "2012 ) . because sgrs and axps exhibit episodic variable spindown behavior ( see , e.g. , woods et al .",
    "2002 ) , the characteristic age should only be taken as a rough indicator of the true age of sgr 0526@xmath066 .",
    "if sgr  0526@xmath066  is indeed associated with n49 , it requires a rather high radial velocity for the neutron star compared to some other axps and sgrs ( gaensler et al . 2001 ; kaplan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "long term observations of magnetars may play an important role in our understanding of the magnetic field decay and its effects on the neutron star crust and long term cooling .",
    "however , observations of magnetars over the last couple of decades showed that these neutron stars are rarely in quiescent state : they show giant flares ( hurley et al . 1999 ; 2005 ) , outbursts ( ng et al .",
    "2011 ) , glitches ( dib et al . 2007 ) , which likely affect the long - term cooling prevent any observational constrains on the theoretical calculations .",
    "although located at a large distance and residing within a snr , sgr  0526@xmath066 is an exception in this regard .",
    "since the giant flare observed in 1979 and the bursting activity that lasted till 1983 , no burst activity has been reported from this source , enabling us to assume that the source has been steadily cooling in quiescence .",
    "this is also confirmed by our spectral results presented in section [ spec ] .",
    "one other advantage of this source is its possible association with the supernova remnant n49 , providing a reasonable age estimate for the neutron star .",
    "aguilera et al .",
    "( 2008a ) calculated cooling curves for strongly magnetized neutron stars by taking into account the ohmic dissipation ( @xmath22 ) and hall drift ( @xmath23 ) processes , where the latter is employed for a rapid decay during early stages ( see eq .",
    "17 in aguilera et al .",
    "we can compare our results with the magnetic neutron star cooling curves calculated by aguilera et al.(2008a , b ) by using a conservative age range for sgr 0526 - 66 , together with the surface temperature that we determined from six chandra observations covering nearly a 10 year time interval .",
    "we take the age of the neutron star to be @xmath24  yr , which spans the spindown age of sgr 0526 - 66 and the supernova remnant age reported by park et al.(2003 , 2012 ) . in figure [ cooling ] , we present the cooling curves for magnetars with various initial magnetic field strengths , along with the current surface temperature of sgr  0526@xmath066 .",
    "our comparison shows the cooling trend of sgr  0526@xmath066 matches the theoretical cooling curves corresponding to two sets of parameters , an initial magnetic field strength of 10@xmath25 g , @xmath26 of 10@xmath27 yr and @xmath28 = 5@xmath310@xmath29 yr , or the curve that corresponds to an initial magnetic field strength of 1 - 5@xmath310@xmath10  g , @xmath22 of 10@xmath27 yr and @xmath30 = 5@xmath310@xmath31 yr .    on either cooling track",
    ", sgr  0526@xmath066  is expected to enter a phase of more rapid cooling in the near future , based on its age and its current temperature , which we reported here .",
    "if its temperature indeed begins to decay rapidly , observations of the source over the next decade with planned x - ray telescopes , such as advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics , may reveal a more significant drop in the spectral temperature , accompanied by a further flux decay , as long as the source remains in its deep quiescence .",
