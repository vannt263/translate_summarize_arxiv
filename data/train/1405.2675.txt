    "the electronic properties of few - electron quantum dots in semiconductor nanostructures have been widely studied over the past decades @xcite .",
    "typically , electrons in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas formed at the interface between different semiconductor layers are confined to a localized region in space by means of electrostatic trapping .",
    "the resulting confinement is usually well approximated by a parabolic potential with oscillator frequency @xmath9 , suggesting a simple 2d oscillator spectrum .",
    "however , coulomb interactions are important in such devices , and their impact can readily be seen in transport spectroscopy @xcite . apart from the ubiquitous coulomb charging effects , they are also predicted to induce a transition to a finite - size wigner crystal of @xmath0 electrons , the `` wigner molecule '' @xcite , where the electrostatic repulsion suppresses quantum fluctuations and inter - electron distances are maximized @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the confinement scale , @xmath10 , with the effective mass @xmath11 , and the bohr radius , @xmath12 , defines a dimensionless interaction strength parameter @xcite , @xmath13 interactions are here described by the standard coulomb potential , @xmath14 , where the dielectric constant @xmath15 accounts for static external screening .",
    "the crossover from the weakly interacting fermi liquid phase ( realized for @xmath16 ) to the wigner molecule then happens around @xmath17 and is known to be rather sharp despite of the finite - size geometry @xcite . due to the confinement - induced reduction of quantum fluctuations ,",
    "the corresponding electron densities near the transition are much higher than the one required for bulk wigner crystal formation @xcite .",
    "another modification of the 2d oscillator spectrum is caused by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we here focus on the rashba term caused by interface electric fields , which often is the dominant spin - orbit coupling and can be tuned by gate voltages @xcite .",
    "other types of spin - orbit coupling are expected to generate similar physics as described below , assuming that one can reach the corresponding strong - coupling regime . in particular",
    ", the model studied below applies directly to the case of dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling @xcite . with the rashba wavenumber @xmath18 , it is convenient to employ a dimensionless rashba coupling , @xmath19 the single - particle spectrum of a dot with weak rashba coupling , @xmath20 , has been discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "interaction effects in few - electron dots with @xmath20 have been investigated by density functional theory @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , and configuration interaction calculations @xcite . with increasing @xmath21 ,",
    "the wigner molecule transition was found to shift to weaker interactions , i.e. , to smaller @xmath22 .",
    "as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , the related bulk wigner crystal formation is also easier to achieve when the rashba term is present .    in this paper , we study interacting few - electron quantum dots in the regime of large rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xmath3 .",
    "this regime appears to be within close experimental reach @xcite , and is also of considerable fundamental interest .",
    "in fact , many materials with strong spin - orbit coupling are known to realize a topological insulator phase @xcite . near the boundary of a noninteracting",
    "2d topological insulator with time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , an odd number of gapless one - dimensional ( 1d ) helical edge states must be present @xcite , where the spin is tied to the momentum of the electron . as we do not address magnetic field effects here , the hamiltonian below enjoys trs .",
    "moreover , it is characterized by strong spin - orbit coupling , and it resembles a topological insulator in the absence of interactions .",
    "given the above developments , it is not surprising that several theoretical works @xcite have already addressed the physics of noninteracting electrons in quantum dots with @xmath3 . in this limit",
    ", the low - energy spectrum of a parabolic dot is well described by a sequence of almost flat landau - like bands ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] ) , @xmath23 with half - integer total angular momentum @xmath24 and the band index @xmath25 , such that states with the same @xmath26 but different @xmath24 are almost degenerate .",
    "equation ( [ dispersionrelation ] ) reflects the spectrum of a 1d ( radial ) oscillator plus a decoupled rotor with large moment of inertia . assuming that the fermi energy is within the @xmath27 band , with corresponding fermi angular momentum @xmath28 , the kramers pair with @xmath29 has eigenfunctions localized near the `` edge '' of the dot .",
    "in fact , those states have the largest distance from the dot center among all occupied states , and form a helical edge with opposite spin orientation of the counterpropagating @xmath30 states @xcite . by virtue of the bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that a noninteracting dot with @xmath3 has features similar to the finite - size version of a 2d topological insulator .",
    "indeed , time reversal invariant single - particle perturbations , e.g. , representing the effects of elastic disorder , are predicted not to mix opposite - spin states , and the helical edge is therefore protected against such sources of backscattering . in the finite - size dot geometry , however , the @xmath31 invariant commonly employed to classify the topological insulator phase is not well defined .    for a dot with @xmath3 ,",
    "since the noninteracting spectrum is almost flat , one can expect that interactions have a profound effect .",
    "for instance , in lattice models hosting a topological insulator phase for weak interactions , mott insulator or spin liquid phases emerge for strong interactions @xcite ; for the case of interacting bosons , see refs .",
    "moreover , the conspiracy of a single - particle potential with sufficiently strong coulomb interactions can induce two - particle umklapp processes destroying the helical edge state @xcite .",
    "motivated by these developments , we here study the ground state of interacting electrons in a quantum dot with strong rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we find it quite remarkable that the relatively simple hamiltonian below captures such diverse behaviors as wigner molecule formation , the presence of helical edge states , and  as we shall argue  the molecular equivalent of an _",
    "orbital ferromagnet_. this hamiltonian is also expected to accurately describe semiconductor experiments , where recent progress holds promise of reaching the ultra - strong rashba coupling regime .",

    "[ sec2a ] , we present the single - particle model for the quantum dot , and summarize its solution for large rashba parameter @xmath21 . while our general conclusions hold for arbitrary radially symmetric confinement , quantitative results are provided for the most important case of a parabolic trap .",

    "low - energy states have positive helicity with @xmath57 and for given @xmath58 , a u(1 ) degeneracy is realized , corresponding to a ring in momentum space .    in the presence of the trap",
