    "the sitnikov problem ( sp ) @xcite is one of the simplest dynamical systems in celestial mechanics that provides all kinds of chaotic behavior .",
    "the configuration of the system is defined by : two point - like bodies of equal masses ( called primaries ) orbiting around their common centre of mass due to their mutual gravitational forces , and a third body of negligible mass moving along a line , perpendicular to the orbital plane of the primaries , going through their barycentre . for the circular motion of the primaries ,",
    "the problem is integrable and @xcite gave a closed form analytical solution with elliptic integrals .",
    "@xcite showed the existence of chaotic behavior using symbolic dynamics .    in the last decades",
    "the problem was investigated in details both analytically and numerically .",
    "@xcite derived a mapping model to investigate the problem . @xcite introduced a new formulation for the equation of motion by using the true anomaly of the primaries as independent variable .",
    "@xcite extended the analytical approximations up to very high orders by using extensive computer algebra .",
    "@xcite showed by numerical computations that invariant curves exist for small oscillations around the barycentre .",
    "@xcite determined invariant rotational curves by applying the birkhoff normal form of an area - preserving mapping .",
    "periodic solutions were studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the complete phase space was studied numerically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sitnikov problem is the perfect manifestation of a scattering process in which a particle approaches a dynamical system from infinity , interacts with the system and ultimately the particle leaves it .",
    "escapes to infinity in sitnikov problem were studied by @xcite .",
    "the test particle can escape the system via different exits , thus one can determine the basins of escape , since in these systems infinity acts as an attractor for an escaping particle . a detailed study about basins of escape",
    "can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is how the structure of the phase space changes due to relativistic effects .",
    "since @xcite gave the solution of the relativistic two - body problem in the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation , many papers have dealt with pericentre advance in celestial mechanics , especially in the case of binary pulsars where the masses of celestial bodies are of the same magnitude @xcite .",
    "it is an established fact that the pericentre precession in the post - newtonian two - body problem is the same as in schwarzschild s metric @xcite expressed by the total mass .",
    "namely , the pericentre advance in one revolution is @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the gravitational constant , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the masses of the bodies , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the classical semi - major axis and the eccentricity , respectively . in eq .",

    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the derivation of the equations of motion can be found in the appendix .",
    "the sitnikov problem is a particular case of the restricted three - body problem .",
    "the third , mass - less body has no effect on the primaries motion , neither in the classical , nor in the relativistic case .",

    "[ fig : rel_str].,width=302 ]    the rsp has one new parameter , the gravitational radius @xmath15 .",
    "the qualitative features of the phase space depends then on @xmath15 only .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : rel_pss ] and [ fig : class ] that even a small @xmath15 can change the phase portrait dramatically . for @xmath49",
    "the main difference to the classical case is the modified surroundings of the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the central region is similar to the classical case , invariant tori are situated around the stable origin .",
    "however , the main islands corresponding to the 2:1 resonance are changed .",
    "the irregularly scattered points around the islands of stability represent the trajectories that can escape the system sooner or later .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff_lambda ] shows three phase portraits for different values of the gravitational radius @xmath50 one can draw several conclusions from these plots .",
    "first , it is evident that the central stable region is shrinking when @xmath15 becomes larger .",
    "it means , if the perturbation is larger , the domain of the ordered motion is smaller .",
    "second , the size of the island of the 2:1 resonance becomes larger along the direction parallel to the @xmath27 axis and smaller perpendicular to it . during this process , the perimeter of the island increases resulting in a longer island chain around the last kam - torus .",
    "consequently , there are longer cantori which the scattered trajectories can stick to during the scattering process .",
    "we will see this in the next section .",
    "we have identified a bifurcation at @xmath51 the qualitative change due to the increasing gravitational radius is well - seen in figure  [ fig : bifurc ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the right island of the 2:1 resonance with one stable elliptic fixed point on the phase portrait sitting in the middle of the regular island .",
    "however , for larger @xmath15 ( panel ( b ) and ( c ) ) the stable periodic orbit becomes unstable and two new elliptic fixed points appear to the left and right .    in order to show another picture about how the phase space changes with @xmath39 we plotted the escape times in a contour plot ( figure  [ fig : z_lambda ] ) .",
    "if the mechanical energy of the test - particle becomes positive , the trajectory never returns to the primaries plane , i.e. the test - particle leaves the system . in figure",
    "[ fig : z_lambda ] different colors represent different escape times in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "the contour plot was made as follows .",

    "one can see a pitchfork bifurcations when @xmath15 is growing at @xmath55 beyond the value @xmath56 the island of 1:1 resonance ( @xmath57 ) becomes separated from the main central stable region . in other words , trajectories between the resonant island and the central invariant curves may escape to the infinity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z_lambda ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_lambda]a ) .",
    "the bright colored filaments with higher escape times correspond to a fractal set representing the stable manifold of a chaotic saddle existing far from the stability islands @xcite .",
    "trajectories originating from these initial conditions can spend very long time around the primaries plane before leaving the system .     on the @xmath52 parameter plane .",
    "when the test - particle has positive energy , we store the integration time as the escape time of the orbit .",
    "this contour map was calculated over 100 periods of primaries ( i.e. roughly 628 time units , see the color bar on the right hand side ) .",
    "the central stable region and the right island of the 2:1 resonance ( around @xmath58 ) are plotted in light gray ( orange on - line ) .",
    "these trajectories belong to periodic or quasi - periodic orbits and never escape .",
    "however , there are other regions far from the stable islands where the escape times are higher than many orbital periods of primaries",
    ". these parts of the phase plane contain the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle.,width=302 ]    we can say that the parameter @xmath15 plays a similar role in the rsp as the eccentricity in the classical case .",
    "varying the gravitational radius beyond a fixed eccentricity , we obtain qualitative changes in the phase space as is common in hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "a complete picture of the phase space of the classical sitnikov problem was published in @xcite where escape times show a structure similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : z_lambda ] .      in the previous section",

    "transient chaos appears as a scattering process in conservative dynamics @xcite . in our example",
    "the test particle comes close to the primaries plane and makes several oscillations before escaping .",
    "one can ask where the long - lived trajectories are in the phase space . in order to answer this question ,",
    "a large number of points is distributed uniformly in the phase space and their evolution in time is followed .",
    "we are interested in non - escaping trajectories in a preselected region .",
    "before the trajectories leave the system they draw out a well - defined fractal set in surfaces of sections @xcite . the invariant object in the phase space responsible for the transient chaotic behavior is the chaotic saddle .",
    "they characterize the dynamics in a way chaotic bands characterize permanent chaos .",
    "it was also shown that these invariant saddles have two different parts .",
    "one of them , the hyperbolic part , is responsible for short lifetimes , the other one , the non - hyperbolic part , is situated close to the border of the kam - tori and is associated with the sticky orbits @xcite .      in truly hyperbolic systems",
    "the number of non - escaping trajectories decreases exponentially @xcite .",
    "however , in the sitnikov and also in the relativistic sitnikov problem we have regular islands in the phase portraits , i.e the phase space is mixed",
    ". there are both hyperbolic and non - hyperbolic parts present . in this case",
    "the decrease of the survivors follows the exponential rule only for shorter times , as shown in figure  [ fig : exp ] .     of non - escaped trajectories from a preselected box ( @xmath59 ) in the phase space .",
    "different marks represent different values of @xmath60 triangles - 0 ; diamonds - 0.005 ; crosses - 0.015 ; asterisks - 0.025 ; squares - 0.035 .",

    "one can consider this object as the union of all the hyperbolic unstable periodic orbits and the intersections of their stable and unstable manifolds @xcite .",
    "in other words , the scattered test - particle jumps randomly on the saddle before leaving it .",
    "one can see the numerically determined saddles for various gravitational radii in figure  [ fig : saddles ] . if the number @xmath68 of initial conditions is large enough , the implemented method @xcite allows us to visualize the saddle itself .",
    "we suppose that the initial point of a trajectory lies close to the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle and we follow the evolution of this point forward in time . after some iteration",
    "it must be in the vicinity of the unstable manifold of the saddle .",
    "a suitable integration time @xmath69 can be determined from the average lifetime , @xmath70 of chaos .",
    "we have chosen @xmath71 consequently , the mid - point taken at @xmath72 of the trajectory should be close to the saddle . in order to generate the chaotic saddles of fig  [ fig :",

    "[ fig : saddles ] when @xmath15 is growing and the scenario in figure  [ fig : saddles ] is similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_lambda ] .",
    "the double cantor structure is dominant but empty holes appear at the sites of regular islands .",
    "this is the consequence of the quasi - periodic motion on tori which is permanent and certainly not chaotic , but can be arbitrarily close to the chaotic saddle .          for longer times the number of non - escaping trajectories does not follow the exponential decay .",
    "instead , one observes a power - law decay which is slower than the exponential one , @xmath76 it is an established fact that trajectories which come close to the outer border of the stability islands may stick to them through the debris of the previously destroyed kam curves .",
    "a geometrical consequence of the stickiness effect in the phase space is the denser saddle structure . in other words",
    ", one can observe the remnants of previously destroyed kam - tori , the so called cantori , around the stability islands , and this part can be identified as the non - hyperbolic part of the chaotic saddle .",
    "our numerical investigations support the theoretical results , namely , exponent @xmath77 does not depend on the parameters of the dynamical systems . from fitting straight lines to the points between 500 and 1500 in figure  [ fig : power_law ] , we find @xmath78 irrespective of @xmath50     of non - escaped trajectories .",
    "power - law decay holds in the non - hyperbolic part of the saddle .",
    "trajectories that can come close to the outer kam - tori may spend very long time around them .",
    "the exponent in the power - law decay describes the escape rate of these sticky trajectories .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is not as sensitive as @xmath79 but our results show that a small fluctuation can be detected related to the size of cantori surrounding the quasi - periodic regions .",
    "the parameters and notation are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp].,width=302 ]      in general , when the test - particle escapes the system , i.e. never comes back , it approaches infinity .",
    "therefore , although in conservative systems there are no attractors , one can consider infinity as an attractor of the system .",
    "in other words , beyond the escape energy , infinity behaves as an attractor for those trajectories which leave the system .",
    "initializing many initial conditions in a fine rectangular grid one can identify the basins of escape , figure  [ fig : basins ] . in the relativistic sitnikov problem",
    "the test - particle may leave the system upward or downward from the primaries plane depending on the initial conditions of the trajectory ; two basins of escape can be identify , the basins of @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : basins]a shows these basins .",
    "the white region contains initial conditions that provides the orbits escaping the system upward , points marked with dark gray color correspond to the orbits leaving the system downward .",
    "the third part of the phase portrait ( light gray ) belongs to regular islands the trajectories never escape from .",
    "considering only the basins of escape one can see the very complex structure of the boundary .",
    "the fine - scale structure of the boundary shows that it is not a simple curve , rather a fractal set .",
    "fractality is in general , a result of chaotic motion @xcite .",

    "therefore a new stroboscopic or poincar map was required to visualize correctly the phase space structure .",

    "we have pointed out the shrinking of the central regular domain when the gravitational radius becomes larger and simultaneously several bifurcations occurred to the 2:1 resonance . in order to investigate the chaotic scattering through escapes ,",

    "two different type of escapes , short and long time escape , were distinguished to identify the dual structure of the chaotic saddle .",

    "we consider the motion of three gravitating masses in the first post - newtonian approximation of general relativity .",
    "the first and second particles have the same mass @xmath87 , opposite velocities , and they revolve in the @xmath88 plane around the centre of mass which is at the origin .",
    "their separation and relative velocity is denote by @xmath14 and @xmath89 respectively . in other terms",
    ", @xmath90 the mass @xmath91 of the third particle is negligible compared to @xmath87 .",
    "this third particle moves along the @xmath27 axis .",
    "let us denote @xmath92 by @xmath93 . clearly ,",
    "@xmath94 the lagrangian of the third particle can be derived from the three - particle lagrangian  @xcite by considering @xmath95 and @xmath96 as given functions of the time .",
    "we get ( by omitting full time derivatives ) @xmath97 or , since @xmath98 , @xmath99 the partial derivatives of @xmath100 are : @xmath101      when deriving the equation of motion , in the correction terms we replace the second derivatives with their zeros order expressions , namely @xmath103 further , we use the relation @xmath104 to obtain @xmath105 after rearranging terms , @xmath106    in order to obtain the dimensionless equations , first , we take the semi - major axis ( @xmath4 ) of the keplerian orbit as unit length . consequently , the unit of the velocity is @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the time unit . as in section 2.1",
    "we choose @xmath108 as @xmath109 corresponding to kepler s 3rd law ( up to a constant @xmath110 ) .",
    "thus , the dimensionless equation from ( [ eq : rel_sit ] ) is obtained as equation  ( [ eq : rsp ] ) in the main text ."
