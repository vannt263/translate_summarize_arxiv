    "the behavior of matter at high baryon density is of great interest in connection with neutron stars , the possible existence of quark stars @xcite , and heavy ion collisions @xcite . at normal densities ,",
    "hadronic matter consists of three - quark ( nucleon - like @xcite ) clusters , and the forces between them lead to the familiar saturation properties of nuclear matter ( nm ) . at high densities",
    "one expects a phase transition to quark matter ( qm ) @xcite , but the dynamics of this transition , the transition densities , and the equation of state ( eos ) in the high density regime are largely unknown . in many recent investigations",
    "it has been found that the qm state at high densities differs from a non - interacting quark gas .",
    "in particular , there is an instability with respect to diquark condensation , leading to a color superconducting state @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "diquark correlations are known to play an important role in explaining the properties of single nucleons , for example the flavor dependence of the structure functions @xcite . at high baryon densities",
    "one therefore expects a phase transition from quark - diquark clusters to a diquark condensed phase .",
    "since it is still difficult to obtain unambiguous results for finite density matter directly from qcd , effective quark models provide powerful tools to investigate the behavior of matter as the baryon density increases .",
    "naturally , these models should account for the properties of the free nucleon in terms of constituent quarks , as well as for the saturation properties of nuclear matter at normal densities .",
    "they should also allow for the possibility of a high density qm phase , where chiral symmetry is restored and color symmetry spontaneously broken . in these respects , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite is an attractive candidate .",
    "first , the simplicity of the model allows a direct solution of the relativistic faddeev equation @xcite , leading to a covariant and successful description of the single nucleon @xcite-@xcite .",
    "second , it has been shown recently @xcite that this successful quark - diquark description of the single nucleon can be extended to describe the eos of nm .",
    "the essential ingredient needed to obtain a saturating eos was to simulate the effect of confinement by introducing an infrared cut - off ( in addition to the usual ultraviolet one ) in order to avoid unphysical thresholds corresponding to the decay of hadrons into free quarks @xcite .",
    "third , models of the njl - type are able to describe a high density qm state where chiral symmetry is restored and color symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "it is , of course , desirable to combine these three aspects and describe nucleons , nm and superconducting qm in one consistent framework .",
    "this is the purpose of our present work .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the role of diquark condensation for the phase transition from nm to qm in the njl model .",
    "it is clear that diquark condensation will soften the eos of qm and favor the phase transition .",
    "the transition densities are therefore expected to decrease with increasing pairing strength .",
    "we will investigate this relation , and discuss a possible scenario for the phase transition .",
    "in the course of the calculation we will face the problem of whether or not those parameters of the model which have been determined exclusively by the properties of single nucleons and nm , like the value of the infrared cut - off , the strength of the @xmath0 interaction in the vector meson channel , and the strength of the @xmath1 interaction in the scalar diquark channel , should be taken over to qm . in order to discuss these points , in particular the strength of the @xmath0 interaction in the vector meson channel",
    ", we will also consider the @xmath2 meson mass in the medium .",
    "another purpose of this work is to present a consistent formulation which accounts for the three aspects discussed above - i.e. , the single nucleon , normal nm and superconducting qm .    in sect .",
    "2 we will first explain the model in the framework of the nambu - gorkov formalism @xcite , and then use path integral methods to describe the single nucleon as well as the eos for nm and qm . in sect .",
    "3 we will present present numerical results , and discuss the role of diquark condensation in the phase transition . finally , we summarize our results in sect .",
    "the lagrangian density of the flavor su(2 ) njl model has the general form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the current quark mass , and the chirally symmetric 4-fermi interaction is characterized by the matrices @xmath5 in dirac , flavor and color space , and the corresponding coupling constants @xmath6 .",
    "hadronization techniques to describe the single nucleon and nm , as well as the description of superconducting qm , are simplified very much if one makes use of the nambu - gorkov formalism @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the lagragian density is re - written identically in terms of the fields , the presence of the matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the lower components is a matter of definition .",
    "we include them here because they lead to simplifications in some of the following formulae . ]",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 , as follows : @xmath11 we denote the matrices in the nambu - gorkov space by @xmath12 for the interactions in mesonic ( @xmath13 ) channels , and by @xmath14 for the diquark ( @xmath1 ) channels .",
    "here @xmath15 is the @xmath16 unit matrix , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "it is easy to verify that the only non - zero terms in ( [ nglag ] ) are those which satisfy @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath5 , either @xmath21 or @xmath22 contributes in ( [ nglag ] ) .    any lagragian density of the form ( [ nglag ] ) can further be re - written into a fierz symmetric form @xcite , where the interactions in the diquark channels , characterized by @xmath23 , also appear .",
    "for these terms to be non - zero , the same condition ( [ cond ] ) holds with @xmath24 .",
    "the coupling constants appearing in the fierz symmetric lagrangian density for the various meson and diquark channels are linear combinations of the @xmath6 s appearing in the lagrangian density ( [ nglag ] ) . for the purposes of this work",
    ", we will need only the following terms : @xmath25 which are the interactions in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 color singlet meson channels , and the @xmath28 color @xmath29 diquark ( scalar diquark ) channel .",
    "the color @xmath29 matrices are defined in terms of the antisymmetric gell - mann matrices by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath32 . a sum over @xmath33 and @xmath31",
    "is implied in the last term of eq.([inter ] ) .",
    "the 3 coupling constants in eq.([inter ] ) will be treated as free parameters .",
    "the values of the ratios @xmath34 reflect the form of the original interaction lagrangian density ( [ nglag ] ) .",
    "the 4-fermi interactions , @xmath35 , in eq.([inter ] ) can be eliminated in favor of bosonic auxiliary fields @xmath36 as usual ) . ] by subtracting terms of the form @xmath37 , which are formally equal to zero if we impose the constraints ( equations of motion ) @xmath38 . in this way",
    "we obtain the partially bosonized lagranian density in the form : @xmath39 where the real bosonic auxiliary fields are defined by @xmath40 in the two terms of ( [ lag ] ) involving the diquark fields , a sum over @xmath33 and @xmath31 is implied .",
    "in this section we will use the lagrangian density ( [ lag ] ) to construct the single nucleon as a quark - scalar diquark state .",
    "we then use it to obtain the eos of both nm and qm in the hartree approximation .",
    "the eos of nm , based on the quark - diquark description of the single nucleon , has been derived in ref.@xcite by using a hybrid model to evaluate the expectation value of the quark hamiltonian in the nm ground state , similar in spirit to the model of guichon and collaborators @xcite .",
    "since it is one of the aims of this paper to present a consistent formulation of the single nucleon , nm and qm in one framework , we will follow the path integral formalism based on the quark lagrangian density ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "the general method to obtain the nm eos is as follows : one first uses hadronization methods @xcite to derive an effective hadronic lagrangian density of the @xmath41-model type from the quark lagrangian density , and introduces a chemical potential for the nucleons",
    ". then one can use any of the familiar approximation schemes for relativistic many - nucleon systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will limit ourselves to the hartree approximation . for this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to derive the nucleon kinetic energy term in the presence of the mean meson fields , the c - number terms associated with the mean fields , and the `` trace - log term '' which emerges from the integration over the quark fields .",
    "therefore , although the method outlined below can be used to obtain more complete expressions for the effective hadronic lagrangian density , we will concentrate here on the nucleon kinetic energy term in the presence of mean scalar and vector fields .",
    "we introduce the ( color singlet ) nucleon fields and sources by adding the following terms to the lagrangian density ( [ lag ] ) : @xmath42 \\phi + \\overline{\\phi }     \\left[{\\cal n } + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\delta_a & 0 \\\\         0 & \\delta^*_a     \\end{array } \\right ) \\psi_a \\right ] .",

    "the integrations over the nucleon fields then give unity ",
    "i.e. , the terms ( [ add ] ) do not change the generating functional of the theory .",

    "the meson and diquark fields are now the dynamical variables , while the nucleon field is still an auxiliary variable .",
    "in nm the scalar and vector meson fields have non - zero expectation values , and accordingly one shifts the meson fields to separate these c - number parts from the fluctuation parts over which one has to integrate .",
    "since we will describe the nucleon as a quark - diquark state ( omitting mesonic fluctuations for the present ) , and the nm eos in the hartree approximation , we omit the fluctuation parts of the bosonic fields from now , except for the scalar diquark field which will be used to construct the nucleon .",
    "that is , from now @xmath56 and @xmath57 will denote only the classical parts of the scalar and vector fields , which are expressed in terms of the quark fields @xmath58 , @xmath59 as is considered as a variable in the effective potential , and its physical value , which is the solution of the gap equation at density @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , is denoted as @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the same notation will be used for the nucleon mass @xmath64 and the gap @xmath65 , i.e. , their physical values are @xmath66 and @xmath67 at finite density , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 at zero density . ]",
