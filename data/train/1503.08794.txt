    "the littleness of the planck length is indescribable .",
    "the immense size the observable universe is paralyzing .",
    "however , the geometric mean of the two characteristic values results in a tangible quantity .",
    "explicitly , @xmath7 , where the planck length @xmath8 m and the gigaparsec @xmath9 m.    as we will show in the example discussed in the essay , better understanding of both the super - short and super - large scales can be gained thanks to this property .",
    "so , how does it work ?",
    "there are two main possibilities .",
    "the first one is a result of accumulation of the tiny planck scale deviations acting on particles propagating across cosmological distances .",
    "the second possibility exploits the evolution of the universe .",
    "the universe is as big as it is because it is expanding . as a result ,",
    "the planck scale in the early universe , multiplied by the growth factor becomes macroscopic in the mature universe . in both cases",
    ", the multiplication law brings the planck scale closer to the scales of our perception .",
    "we do not know yet what the planck scale physics is .",
    "however , by taking the use of the compensation of scales discussed above , one may already try to falsify the theoretical models of quantum gravitational phenomena , which we have .",
    "the theory of planck scale physics which we are going to examine here is causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) @xcite .",
    "the theory is a non - perturbative approach based on the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the crucial ingredient of the theory is a causality condition imposed at the level of wick - rotated time coordinate . in similarity to statistical physics , the different space - time configurations are evaluated using monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "various promising results arose from numerical studies of the quantum gravitational system with the positive cosmological constant .",
    "one of the most profound is the emergence of four dimensional de sitter space - time @xcite in the so - called phase c. however , as reflected by features of the process of diffusion taking place at the simplicial manifold of cdt , the reconstructed de sitter space - time is not fully classical .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the spectral dimension characterizing the diffusion process can be parametrized in the following way @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion time . at the representative point in phase c ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) the values @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite",
    "have been obtained from numerical simulations . in both cases , four dimensional space - time ( @xmath20 )",
    "is correctly recovered in the ir limit ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , in the uv limit ( @xmath22 ) dimensional reduction to @xmath23 is predicted .",
    "this effect is not reserved to cdt only and has been noticed in other approaches to quantum gravity as well @xcite .    the expression ( [ spectralparametrization ] ) is a starting point for further considerations .",
    "after fixing the ir value @xmath24 to be precisely equal to the topological space - time dimension @xmath25 and parametrizing the departure from @xmath26 in uv by @xmath27 we obtain @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 can be related to the energy scale of the dimensional reduction : @xmath31 .",
    "the spectral dimension discussed in the previous section is formally defined as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average return probability of the random walk ( diffusion ) process . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the invariant measure in the momentum space , which we assume to be the classical one @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the laplace operator in momentum space . in the case of the euclidean 4-dimensional space @xmath37",
    "this expression might be viewed as the wick rotated @xmath38 version of the analogous formula in the minkowski space @xmath39 , which defines dispersion relation for the free fields living on the space - time ( @xmath40 ) . in this case , the equations ( [ spectraldim ] ) and ( [ returnprobability ] ) predict @xmath41 , where @xmath25 is the topological dimension .",
    "cdt predicts that the spectral dimension varies as a function of the diffusion time @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding moment laplace operator has to be , therefore , deformed with respect to the classical case . here , we parametrize this departure in the following manner @xmath42 where @xmath43 is some unknown function of @xmath44",
    ". the task would be now to recover the form of the function @xmath43 for the cdt spectral dimension ( [ cdtsd2 ] ) . in this case , the expression for the return probability is @xmath45 where integrations over @xmath46 and the angular part of @xmath47 have been performed . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relation ( [ rpreduced ] ) can be converted into the form of the inverse laplace transform @xmath48 the @xmath49 has to satisfy the condition @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes singularities of @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 function is recovered by integrating definition ( [ spectraldim ] ) with use of parametrization ( [ cdtsd2 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath54 which , when applied to ( [ inverselaplace ] ) , leads to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "equation ( [ defdisprel ] ) , is an entangled form of the deformed dispersion relation @xmath57 .",
    "the function @xmath58 for @xmath59 is shown in fig .",
    "[ disp ] .    in the ir limit",
    "@xmath60 the dispersion relation is approximated by @xmath61 so the classical limit is correctly recovered .",
    "however , when passing to the high energy range ( the uv limit ) the dispersion relation undergoes deflection to the form @xmath62    both of the obtained limiting behaviors of the deformed dispersion relation will now be used to construct the relation of cdt to astrophysical and cosmological observations .",
    "the dispersion relation derived in the previous section can now be used to find the group velocity of photons . for the particles having energy @xmath63 the ir limit approximation ( [ irlim ] ) may be applied , leading to the quadratic deviation @xmath64 this expression predicts that the group velocity is increasing with the energy ( superluminal behavior ) .",
    "therefore , when a bunch of photons of different energies are emitted simultaneously the ones with the highest energy will arrive first to the observer .",
    "this effect can be quantified by the arrival time difference between @xmath46 and @xmath65 energy photons . with use of formula ( [ groupvelocity ] ) , the corresponding expression is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the distance to a source .",
    "although a huge value of the energy scale @xmath68 is expectedgev . ] , the multiplication by a sufficiently large distance @xmath67 may bring the value of @xmath69 close to the observational window .",
    "the effect can be constrained with use of the signals from the high - energy astrophysical sources such as gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the grb 090510 remote by @xmath70 mpc may be used . using the constraint from the _ fermi_-large area telescope @xcite one can find that the energy scale of the dimensional reduction is @xmath71 gev at ( 95 @xmath1 cl ) .",
    "this constraint is definitely much stronger than any obtained from the accelerator physics experiments ( which are reaching energies of the order of @xmath72 gev ) .",
    "however , because of the quadratic ( in energy ) from of the effect , the constraint is distant from the planck scale .",
    "because of the quadratic nature of the ir variation of the group velocity , perhaps the more promising is an application of dimensional reduction to cosmology . here , instead of the ir , the uv part of the dispersion relation will play a crucial role .",
    "the potential relevance of the uv scaling of the modified dispersion relation in cosmology has been suggested in ref .",
    "it has been shown that dimensional reduction to @xmath73 leads to the scale invariant vacuum fluctuations of the primordial perturbations in the uv domain .",
    "what has not been shown is how the shape of the spectrum changes when we try to relate it with the one that is observationally relevant . here",
    ", we show that a deviation from @xmath73 leads to a tilt in the power spectrum .",
    "this prediction is confronted with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "the resulting cdt dispersion relation @xmath57 can be incorporated into the equation of modes for the cosmological perturbations in the following way @xmath74 here , @xmath75",
    "( @xmath76 is the scale factor ) and the classical limit @xmath77 is recovered correctly for @xmath78 .",
    "the value of @xmath79 depends on which kind of perturbations is considered . for the gravitational waves @xmath80 and for the scalar perturbations @xmath81 . in the sub - hubble limit @xmath82",
    ", the vacuum normalization of the @xmath83 mode functions leads to @xmath84 applying this to the definition of the scalar power spectrum we find that for @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the universe is filled with barotropic matter : @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .    indeed , for @xmath73 the power spectrum ( [ scalarps ] ) becomes scale invariant @xmath90 . while it is tempting to relate the obtained spectrum with that inferred from the cmb nearly scale - invariant spectrum of the primordial perturbations , it is not allowed to do so directly .",
    "the spectrum ( [ scalarps ] ) corresponds to the uv regime ( @xmath85 ) which has to be suitably converted into the super - hubble spectrum probed observationally . in general",
    ", this would require evolving the modes starting from the uv domain until crossing the hubble horizon .",
    "this will unavoidably affect the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "a scenario in which knowledge of the intermediate evolution is not required corresponds to the case when the hubble horizon is located in the uv domain . in that case _ freezing _ of the modes occurs already at the level of the uv spectrum ( [ scalarps ] ) .    in this particular situation",
    "the resulting tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath91 can be directly related to the cmb data ) . ] .",
    "the best current observational bound at the pivot scale @xmath92 is @xmath93 ( bicep2/_keck array _ and _ planck _ ) @xcite , which implicates that @xmath94 when the perturbations were formed .",
    "the universe had to , therefore , be very close to the de sitter phase when the perturbations were formed .",
    "cosmic inflation is still needed !",
    "the value of the power spectrum accessible observationally is at the horizon - crossing . in our case",
    ", the horizon - crossing condition @xmath95 translates into @xmath96 @xmath97 . ] for @xmath98 .",
    "using this , the spectral index of scalar perturbations at the horizon - crossing is @xmath99 the scale invariance is still recovered for @xmath100 .",
    "however , by comparing the prediction with the _ planck _ satellite measurement of the spectral index ( @xmath101 ) @xcite and the constraint on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xcite we find that @xmath102 the value is in overt contradiction with the cdt - motivated assumption that @xmath103 .",
    "the scenario considered can be , therefore , ruled out based on the cmb data .",
    "other scenarios , such as those with @xmath104 at the horizon - crossing have to be studied separately , taking into account the evolution of modes in the intermediate energy range .",
    "the results presented in this essay neither prove nor disprove causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "what has been essentially shown is that phenomenology of cdt can be extracted from numerical studies of the spectral dimension .",
    "the predicted energy - dependence of the speed of light allowed us to rule out a possibility of low - energy dimensional reduction .",
    "furthermore , by incorporating the predictions regarding the uv behavior of the spectral dimension to primordial cosmology , we found that the cdt - motivated cosmological scenarios may be observationally falsifiable .",
    "moreover , we explicitly ruled out one of them with use of the observations of the cmb .    as thomas a. edison once said `",
    "i have not failed .",
    "i ve just found 10000 ways that wo nt work . ' quoting the sentence , we are convinced that unabated stubbornness in eliminating planck scale scenarios will eventually lead to a discovery comparable only with edison s one .",
