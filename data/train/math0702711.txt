    "the _ global action construction of k - theory , introduced by a.bak  @xcite , associates to a ring @xmath0 an algebraic object , namely the global action @xmath1 which constitutes the algebraic analogue of the standard topological construction .",
    "the underlying set of the global action @xmath1 consists of the points of the general linear group of @xmath0 and the action consists of the virtual triangular subgroups of the general linear group acting on the general linear group by left multiplication . _",
    "this new approach introduced by bak has the advantage that the solutions of algebraic problems can be followed algebraically step by step .",
    "the notion of global action gives algebraic objects such as groups , structures which allow one to develop homotopy theory similarly to the classical way , by defining paths and deformations of morphisms . in @xcite ,",
    "the second named author developed an axiomatic homotopy theory for categories with natural cylinders , which can be applied to global actions .",
    "recently , a. bak , r. brown , e.g. minian and t. porter generalized ideas and constructions of global actions and introduced _ groupoid atlases _ @xcite . as it was pointed out in @xcite , there were many advantages in formulating the concept of global action in terms of groupoids instead of group actions , so that it becomes part of a wider notion , namely the concept of a groupoid atlas .",
    "this was done using the well know transition of group actions to groupoids .",
    "a groupoid atlas can be regarded as an _ algebraic manifold _",
    ", where the local groupoids play the role of the charts .",
    "in this paper we define and investigate homotopy invariants of global actions and groupoid atlases .",
    "we study the strong fundamental groupoid , the weak and strong nerves , classifying spaces and homology theory of groupoid atlases .",
    "we also relate all these new invariants to classical constructions in topological spaces , simplicial complexes and simplicial sets and obtain this way new combinatorial formulations of classical and non classical results in terms of groupoid atlases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ s2 ]",
    "we recall the basic definitions , examples and results on global actions and groupoid atlases .",
    "nothing is very new in this section with the exception of a couple of new examples .",
    "one of these examples appears naturally when the global action @xmath2 ( defined in @xcite ) acts on a @xmath3- set @xmath4 .",
    "this induces a new and interesting global action . in the particular case that the general linear group acts on the quadratic forms , this construction is related to hermitian k - theory .",
    "it is important to remark that the model for the line @xmath5 that we introduce here is not exactly the same one that is used in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "both models are isomorphic at the weak level , but the original notion of the line becomes quite rigid when one works with morphisms that also preserve information of the local actions .",
    "this change is essential when defining the strong fundamental group of a groupoid atlas .",
    "we explain below the reasons of this change .",
    "we shall also prove that both models are _ equivalent groupoid atlases .",
    "moreover , our model is the _ regularization of the original one . _ _    in section [ s3 ] we introduce some of the fundamental concepts of this work , such as the notion of _ equivalence between maps of groupoid atlases and the notions of _ irreducible and _ regular atlases .",
    "_ _ _    in section [ s4 ] we study the strong fundamental group of a groupoid atlas .",
    "we use first a _ geometric approach and later we prove that it can also be defined and computed with a more algebraic approach , related to the vertex group of the colimit groupoid of the atlas .",
    "we relate the strong fundamental groupoid with the weak one ( introduced in @xcite ) and we also show how to compute the fundamental groupoid of a topological space using groupoid atlases , via the van kampen theorem .",
    "new formulations of classical and non classical results on the fundamental group of an open covering are also discussed .",
    "_    the last section of the paper is devoted to simplicial methods . to each groupoid atlas",
    "we associate a simplicial set , which we call the _ ( strong ) nerve _ for historical reasons and also because it generalizes in some sense the nerve of a groupoid .",
    "we also introduce a weak version of the nerve ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain this way another definition for the fundamental group of a groupoid atlas .",
    "this independently defined simplicial version is proved to coincide with the other two defined in the previous section .",
    "we finish the paper with an introduction to the homology theory of groupoid atlases .",
    "we compute some easy but clarifying examples .",
    "the article ends with a result which relates the local homology groups with the homology of the whole atlas .",
    "before recalling the basic definitions of _ global actions _ , let us begin with an easy example , which was already exhibited in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be a group and let @xmath6 be a family of subgroups of @xmath3 , acting on @xmath3 by left multiplication .",
    "this will induce a global action , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath7 consists of a single group @xmath8 , then this global action is simply the set of orbits of the action , but when @xmath7 consists of more than one subgroup of @xmath3 , then the different orbits of the actions interact .",
    "we will see later that this interaction is crucial from the homotopical point of view .",
    "for example , consider the case @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the dihedral group of order @xmath11 .",

    "the actions of each @xmath18 divides @xmath3 in orbits which determine the following covering of @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 this covering .",
    "its nerve @xmath20 is the simplicial complex corresponding to the following diagram @xmath21 \\ar@{-}[d ] \\ar@{-}[dr]\\\\ h_b & h_b.r & h_b.r^2\\\\   & h_a.s   \\ar@{-}[ul ] \\ar@{-}[u ] \\ar@{-}[ur ]   } \\ ] ]    in section 3 we shall study the strong fundamental group of global actions . as we can guess , in this case the fundamental group will be isomorphic to @xmath22 .",

    "let @xmath0 be the _",
    "1-sphere _ , defined in [ sc example ] .",
    "the set @xmath23 is @xmath773 , the set of indices @xmath203 consists of the proper non empty subsets of @xmath23 , ordered by inclusion , and for every @xmath17 , the local groupoid @xmath216 is the tree over @xmath17 .",
    "since it is infimum and all its local groupoids are simply connected , by ( [ na equals nwa ] ) we have @xmath774 for each @xmath17 , the nerve of the local groupoid @xmath216 is @xmath775 .",
    "then , there is a short exact sequence of complexes @xmath776 where @xmath777 since the groupoids @xmath216 are simply connected , the non trivial part of the long exact sequence relating the homology groups is , in this case , @xmath778 the group @xmath779 is isomorphic to @xmath117 because @xmath0 is connected , and so @xmath780 : it is free of rank 1 since @xmath781 and the euler characteristic of the last complex is 0 .",
    "all the local groupoids are , in this example , simply connected .",
    "then , by the long exact sequence , the homology groups @xmath741 should be trivial for @xmath783 .",
    "this does not happen , for example , with the @xmath427-sphere ( @xmath783 ) , whose local groupoids are also simply connected .",
    "therefore , for many examples we can not find any expression of @xmath769 as a sum of complexes @xmath772 .",
    "in the example of above , we use the usual presentation of the colimit @xmath758 as the cokernel of the map @xmath784 which is defined on the basis elements by @xmath785 . here",
    "@xmath786 denotes the element of the factor @xmath92 given by the simplex @xmath17 .",
    "in general @xmath618 is not a monomorphism , then one can not identify @xmath769 with the sum @xmath787 .",
    "let @xmath789 be the map defined in the basis elements by @xmath790 . here",
    "@xmath791 denotes the class of the simplex @xmath17 in @xmath537 .",
    "let @xmath792 be an element of @xmath793 .",
    "we have @xmath794 then , for all @xmath795 we have @xmath796 and @xmath797 , where @xmath798 is the boundary map of the simplicial chain complex of @xmath606 . this way , a non trivial element of @xmath793 gives a cycle in some @xmath606 .",
    "the converse is clear .",
    "we expose a simple aplication of last result .",
    "let @xmath0 be a groupoid atlas such that @xmath203 is discrete ( @xmath801 ) . recall that , since @xmath0 is not good , @xmath802 by definition , and note that @xmath803 is discrete for @xmath17 of dimension @xmath804 and is a star for @xmath17 a point .",
    "thus , we have      the procedure of above can be emulated in other contexts , considering a cofinal subset of local groupoids @xmath809 to make the canonical map @xmath810 an epimorphism ( when @xmath203 is finite , then @xmath140 could be the set of maximal objects ) , and then construct @xmath811 as the sum of the chain complexes associated to certain local groupoids ."
