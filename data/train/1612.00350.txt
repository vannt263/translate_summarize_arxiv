    "in the past decade , many near - threshold charmonium - like states have been reported by belle , babar , besiii , lhcb and other collaborations , which triggers lots of studies on the molecule - like hadrons containing heavy quarks .",
    "for example , the triplet of excited @xmath14 baryons , @xmath15 , was observed by belle  @xcite , and they tentatively identified the quantum numbers of these states as @xmath16 .",
    "the same neutral state @xmath17 was also observed in @xmath18 decays by the babar collaboration with the mean value of mass higher by about @xmath19 from that obtained by belle  @xcite , although the widths from these two measurements are consistent .",
    "moreover , a new charmed hadron @xmath11 with mass @xmath20 and width @xmath21 was reported by babar collaboration by analyzing the @xmath22 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite , and it is confirmed as a resonant structure in the final state of @xmath23 by belle  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations have stimulated extensive interest in understanding the structures of the states @xmath15 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the @xmath15 and @xmath11 are near the threshold of @xmath0 and @xmath7 , respectively , many work treat them as candidates of molecular states . for the @xmath15 , m. lutz and e. kolomeitsev interpreted it as a chiral molecule  @xcite , while c. jimnez - tejero _ et al .",
    "_ found it was a dynamically generated resonance with a dominant @xmath0 configuration  @xcite .",
    "y. b. dong _",
    "_ estimated the strong @xmath24 decays of the @xmath15 state for different spin - parity assignments by assuming a dominant molecular @xmath0 structure of the state and showed that the decay widths of @xmath25 were consistent with current data for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 assignments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , j. r. zhang investigated @xmath15 and @xmath11 as the @xmath28wave @xmath0 state with @xmath29 and @xmath7 state with @xmath27 , respectively in the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "the results showed that the masses of these two states were bigger than the experimental data , but the compact structure of the states could be ruled out  @xcite . for the @xmath11 , x. g. he _",
    "et  al . _",
    "proposed that it may be a @xmath30 molecular state with @xmath29  @xcite , while y. b. dong _",
    "_ showed the @xmath11 was a molecular state composed of a nucleon and @xmath31 mesons with @xmath26 by studying the decay widths of the strong two - body decay channels @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite , and this conclusion was confirmed by investigating the width of the radiative decay process @xmath35  @xcite and the strong three - body decay process @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "moreover , j. he and x. liu explained the @xmath11 as an isoscalar @xmath28wave or @xmath38wave @xmath39 system with @xmath40 or @xmath26 in the framework of the one - boson - exchange model  @xcite . and in ref .",
    "@xcite , they found a possible molecular candidate with @xmath27 for the @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , a bound state @xmath39 with @xmath27 , which can be explained as the @xmath11 , was also obtained in a constituent quark model  @xcite . in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the total cross section of the @xmath41 reaction was calculated within an effective lagrangian approach , which indicated that the spin - parity assignment of @xmath42 for @xmath11 gave a sizable enhancement for the total cross section in comparison with a choice of @xmath43 .    another way to describe the states @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath11 is based on the assumption that they are conventional charmed baryons .",
    "a relativized potential model predicted that the masses of @xmath44 with @xmath27 or @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 or @xmath45 are close to the value of @xmath15 and @xmath11 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the strong decays of @xmath15 and @xmath11 as charmed baryons have been studied by using @xmath48 model  @xcite , heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , and chiral quark model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , ebert _",
    "_ suggested @xmath15 as one of the orbital ( @xmath49 ) excitations of the @xmath14 with @xmath29 , @xmath50 or @xmath45 , and proposed @xmath11 as the first radial excitation of @xmath14 with @xmath47  @xcite . j. he _",
    "et  al . _",
    "estimated the production rate of @xmath11 as a charmed baryon at panda  @xcite .",
    "h. garcilazo _",
    "et  al . _ solved exactly the three - quark problem by means of the faddeev method in momentum space , and showed that @xmath15 would correspond to an orbital excitation with @xmath29 or @xmath50 , and the @xmath11 may constitute the second orbital excitation of the @xmath51 baryon  @xcite .",
    "although many theoretical explanations to @xmath15 and @xmath11 were proposed , the properties of these two states are still in ambiguous . therefore",
    ", more efforts are needed to reveal the underlying structure of these two states .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely accepted as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction . however , the direct use of qcd for low - energy hadron physics , for example , the properties of hadrons , the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath52 ) interaction , is still difficult because of the nonperturbative complications of qcd .",
    "qcd - inspired quark models are still the main approach to study the hadron - hadron interaction .    it is well known that the forces between nucleons ( hadronic clusters of quarks ) are qualitative similar to the forces between atoms ( molecular force ) .",
    "this similarity is naturally explained in the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm )  @xcite , which has been developed and extensively studied . in this model , quarks confined in one nucleon are allowed to delocalize to a nearby nucleon and the confinement interaction between quarks in different baryon orbits is modified to include a color screening factor .",
    "the latter is a model description of the hidden color channel coupling effect  @xcite .",
    "the delocalization parameter is determined by the dynamics of the interacting quark system , thus allows the quark system to choose the most favorable configuration through its own dynamics in a larger hilbert space .",
    "the model gives a good description of nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon interactions and the properties of deuteron  @xcite .",
    "it is also employed to calculated the baryon - baryon scattering phase shifts and the dibaryon candidates in the framework of the resonating group method ( rgm )  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been used to investigate the pentaquarks with heavy quarks , and the @xmath53 can be explained as the molecular pentaquark of @xmath54 with quantum numbers @xmath55 in qdcsm  @xcite .    in present work , qdcsm is employed to study the properties of @xmath0 systems , and the channel - coupling effect of @xmath7 , @xmath56 , and @xmath12 channels are included .",
    "our purpose is to investigate whether @xmath15 and @xmath11 could be explained as a molecular state composed of a nucleon and @xmath57 or @xmath31 mesons . on the other hand ,",
    "we also want to see if any other bound or resonance state exist or not .",
    "extension of the study to the bottom case is also interesting and is performed here .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we present a brief introduction of the quark model used in section 2 .",
    "section 3 devotes to the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the summary is shown in the last section .",
    ".[mass]the masses of the baryons and charmed and bottom mesons ( in mev ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ bound_c ]    for the @xmath8 system , the single channel calculation shows that the energy of @xmath0 is above its threshold although there is a weak attraction between @xmath82 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is unbound ( labeled as `` @xmath83 '' in table  [ bound_c ] ) , and the @xmath7 is also unbound , because the interaction between @xmath82 and @xmath31 is repulsive as mentioned above . however , by taking into account the channel - coupling effect , we obtain a stable state , the mass of which is lower than the threshold of @xmath0 .",
    "the binding energy and the mass of this bound state is shown in table  [ bound_c ] , which is labeled as `` @xmath84 '' .",
    "first , we should mention how we obtain the mass of a bound molecular pentaquark .",
    "generally , the mass of a molecular pentaquark can be written as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 stand for the theoretical masses of a baryon and a meson respectively , and @xmath18 is the binding energy of this molecular state . in order to minimize the theoretical errors and to compare calculated results to the experimental data , we shift the mass of molecular pentaquark to @xmath88 , where the experimental masses of baryons and mesons are used . taking this bound state as an example ,",
    "the calculated mass of pentaquark is @xmath89 mev , then the binding energy @xmath18 is obtained by subtracting the theoretical masses of @xmath82 and @xmath57 , @xmath90 ( mev ) . adding the experimental masses of the hadrons , the mass of the pentaquark @xmath91 ( mev ) is arrived .",
    "secondly , we find that the mass of this bound state is close to the mass of the observed @xmath9 , which was reported by belle collaboration .",
    "therefore , in our quark model calculation @xmath9 can be explained as a @xmath0 molecular state with the quantum number @xmath92 .",
    "finally , the coupling between the @xmath28wave @xmath0 and @xmath7 channels , which is through the central force , is of crucial importance for obtaining a bound state here . in order to see the strength of these channel - coupling",
    ", we calculate the transition potential of these two channels , which is shown in fig .",
    "obviously , it is a strong coupling among these channels that makes @xmath0 the bound state .",
    "this mechanism to form a bound state has been proposed before .",
    "eric s. swanson proposed that the admixtures of @xmath93 and @xmath94 states were important for forming @xmath95 state  @xcite , which was also demonstrated by t. fernndez - carams and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism also applied to the study of @xmath96-dibaryon  @xcite , in which the single channel @xmath97 is unbound , but when coupled to the channels @xmath98 and @xmath99 , it becomes a bound state .",
    "lccccccc & &  @xmath1   &  @xmath100   &  @xmath101   &  @xmath102   &  @xmath84   + @xmath103 &  @xmath104   & @xmath105 & @xmath106 & @xmath107 & @xmath107 & @xmath108 + @xmath109 &  @xmath104   & @xmath107 & @xmath110 & @xmath107 & @xmath107 & @xmath110 + @xmath111 &  @xmath104   & @xmath105 & @xmath106 & @xmath107 & @xmath112 & @xmath105 + @xmath113 &  @xmath104   & @xmath107 & @xmath106 & @xmath114 & @xmath115 & @xmath106 + @xmath116 &  @xmath104   & @xmath107 & @xmath107 & @xmath107 & @xmath117 & @xmath117 +    [ bound_b ]    for the @xmath10 system , it includes only one channel @xmath7 , and it is a bound state with the mass of @xmath118 mev , which is close to the mass of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in our quark model calculation , @xmath11 can be explained as a @xmath7 molecular state with the quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusion of ref.@xcite , in which they proposed that the @xmath11 could be explained as isoscalar @xmath28wave or @xmath38wave @xmath39 systems with @xmath27 or @xmath26 in the framework of the one boson exchange model .",
    "meanwhile , a constituent quark model calculation also supported the existence of @xmath11 as a molecular state composed by nucleon and @xmath31 mesons with @xmath27  @xcite .    for the @xmath119 system ,",
    "the @xmath0 is unbound because of the repulsive interaction between @xmath82 and @xmath57 as shown in fig .",
    "and for @xmath7 channel , the attraction is too weak to tie the two particles together , so it is also unbound . due to the stronger attraction",
    ", the energy of @xmath12 is below its threshold , so the standalone @xmath12 is a bound state here .",
    "then , we do a channel - coupling calculation .",
    "the results show that no stable state can be obtained , i.e. , all the energies obtained are higher than the threshold of @xmath0 , which indicates that the channel - coupling effect is not strong enough to make @xmath0 bound here .",
    "the transition potential of these three channels are shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , and we find they are smaller than the one of @xmath8 @xmath0 and @xmath7 channels , which is shown in fig .",
    "moreover , coupling to the @xmath0 and @xmath7 channels , the energy of state @xmath12 is pushed above its threshold , thus preventing a resonance from materializing .    for the @xmath120 system ,",
    "the results are similar with those of the @xmath119 system .",
    "the @xmath7 is unbound due to the repulsive potential between @xmath82 and @xmath31 as shown in fig .",
    "both the standalone @xmath56 and @xmath12 states are bound because of the strong attractions between the corresponding two hadrons .",
    "however , these two states disappear by coupling to the @xmath7 channel .    for the @xmath13 system , there is only one channel @xmath12",
    ", its energy , @xmath121 mev , is below the corresponding threshold .",
    "it is a good resonance state after coupling to @xmath0 by means of tensor interaction .",
    "this result is consistent with the one of ref  @xcite , in which they showed that the @xmath12 with @xmath13 was an attractive state , presenting a resonance close to threshold by means of a chiral constituent quark model .",
    "because of the heavy flavor symmetry , we also extend the study to the bottom case of @xmath1 system , the numerical results for which are listed in table [ bound_b ] .",
    "the results are similar to the @xmath0 system . from table",
    "[ bound_b ] , we find there are several interesting states : a @xmath1 bound state with @xmath8 by two channels ( @xmath1 and @xmath100 ) coupling ; a @xmath100 resonance state with @xmath10 ; and a @xmath102 resonance state with @xmath13 .",
    "in summary , we perform a dynamical calculation of the @xmath0 systems with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 in the framework of qdcsm .",
    "our results show : ( 1 ) all the positive parity states are unbound in our calculation .",
    "( 2 ) the pure @xmath0 with @xmath8 is unbound , but a bound state with mass of @xmath122 mev can be obtained by coupling the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the mass of this bound state is close to the observed @xmath9 , which shows that @xmath9 can be explained as a @xmath0 molecular state with the quantum number @xmath92 in our quark model calculation .",
    "( 3 ) the @xmath7 with @xmath10 is also a resonance state with the mass of @xmath118 mev , closing to the mass of @xmath11 , which indicates that @xmath11 can be explained as a @xmath7 molecular state with the quantum number @xmath16 in qdcsm .",
    "( 4 ) the @xmath13 @xmath12 is also a resonance state with mass of @xmath121 mev . besides",
    ", the calculation is also extended to the bottom case of @xmath1 system .",
    "the results are similar to the case of the @xmath0 system . on the experimental side , confirming the existence of the charmed hadrons @xmath9 and @xmath11 is an interesting subject .",
    "besides , searching for other molecular states with heavy quarks , such as @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath100 and @xmath102 will be challenging topics in future .",
