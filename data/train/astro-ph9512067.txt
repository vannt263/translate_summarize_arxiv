    "measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide an effective method for constraining models of large scale structure formation .",
    "standard inflationary models predict a doppler peak at angular scales @xmath31 . the millimeter - wave anisotropy experiment ( max ) measures anisotropy on 05 angular scales .",
    "max has presented cmb results for six sky regions from four previous flights ( @xcite ) .",
    "several other ground - based and balloon - borne experiments have also reported detections at these angular scales ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we report on two new cmb observations from the fifth flight of max ( max5 ) .",
    "the instrument has been described in detail elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "max is an off - axis gregorian telescope and a bolometric photometer mounted on an attitude - controlled balloon platform .",
    "the telescope has a 1  m off - axis parabolic primary with an elliptical secondary which sinusoidally modulates the beam 14 peak - to - peak on the sky parallel to the horizon at 5.4  hz .",
    "the underfilled optics provide an approximately gaussian 05  fwhm beam . for max5 an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator cooled the single - pixel , four - band photometer to 85  mk .",
    "the four frequency bands were centered at 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14  @xmath0 with respective fractional bandwidths 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.4 , and 0.2 .",
    "the ratio of 2.726  k thermodynamic temperature to antenna temperature in each frequency band is 1.62 , 2.50 , 6.66 , and 38.7 , respectively .",
    "the instrument was launched from the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas at 1.16  ut 1994 june  20 .",
    "the altitude during the observations drifted from 35  km to 32  km .",
    "we observed cmb anisotropies in three sky regions .",
    "each cmb observation consists of constant velocity scans in azimuth of @xmath44  while optically tracking a target star such that sky rotation pivots the observed area about the star .",
    "the angular offset between the center of the scan and the target star is 055 so that at the center of the scan the target star is in one lobe of the chopped beam pattern .",
    "the three max5 target stars are hr5127 , phi herculis , and mu pegasi .",
    "lim et al .",
    "( 1995 ) report on the mu pegasi observation .",
    "we report here the results for the sky regions near hr5127 ( @xmath5  =  13@xmath6377 , @xmath7  =  3619 ) and phi herculis ( @xmath5  =  16@xmath6086 , @xmath7  =  4457 ; epoch 1994 ) .",
    "we chose the hr5127 and phi herculis regions for low dust contrast as determined by the iras 100  map ( @xcite ) and the absence of known extragalactic radio sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hr5127 observation lasted from 5.99  ut to 6.97  ut , and the phi herculis observation lasted from 8.29  ut to 8.91  ut .",
    "we calibrated the instrument before and after each observation using a membrane transfer standard ( @xcite ) .",
    "we observed jupiter from 4.86  ut to 4.95  ut to measure the beam size .",
    "we confirm the membrane calibration using the best - fit beam size and the temperature of jupiter ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume a 10% uncertainty in calibration .",
    "the calibration is such that a chopped beam centered between sky regions with temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath9 would yield @xmath10 in the absence of instrumental noise .",
    "anisotropy experiments are potentially susceptible to off - axis response to local sources , particularly the earth , the balloon , and the moon .",
    "we measured the unchopped off - axis response in the 3.5 @xmath0 band to be @xmath11 70  db below the on - axis response at angles from 15  to 25  in elevation above the boresight .",
    "we have not made comparable measurements of the chopped sidelobe response in azimuth .",
    "our strongest argument against possible sidelobe contamination is that the observed structure is stationary on the sky while the horizon and local foregrounds shift .",
    "because the elevation of the observation changes as we track the target star , we expect any sidelobe response from the earth and the balloon to change over time .",
    "to minimize sidelobe response from the moon , we observe when the moon is not full .",
    "hr5127 was @xmath12 56  away from the moon , and phi herculis was @xmath12 66  away from the moon .",
    "the moon set during the phi herculis observation .",
    "we remove transients due to cosmic rays using an algorithm described by alsop et al.(1992 ) .",
    "this procedure excludes approximately 15% of the data .",
    "we demodulate the detector output using the sinusoidal reference from the chopping secondary to produce antenna temperature differences @xmath13 on the sky .",
    "the demodulation produces a data set in phase with the optical signal and a data set 90 out of phase with the optical signal .",
    "the noise averaged over the observations gives respective cmb sensitivities of 590 , 270 , 620 , and 4800 @xmath14 for hr5127 and 600 , 300 , 630 , and 4800 @xmath14 for phi herculis in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands .",
    "the signal in each band is significantly offset from zero for both hr5127 and phi herculis .",
    "we attribute the offset to chopped emissivity differences on the primary mirror and chopped atmospheric emission .",
    "the averages of the measured instrumental offsets in antenna temperature were 0.7 , 0.2 , 1.5 , and 3.0  mk in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands .",
    "the offset fluctuates in the higher frequency bands with amplitudes of 200  @xmath15k and 300  @xmath15k at 9 and 14 @xmath0 .",
    "the period of the fluctuations is @xmath12 300  s. we subtract the offset and offset drift with a linear least squares fit to each half scan from 0  to + 4  to 0and from 0  to -4  to 0 .",
    "each half scan takes 72  s. this method removes the @xmath12 300  s fluctuations as long as the @xmath12 300  s fluctuations are not phase - synchronous with the scan period . after the offset and offset drift removal , the residual temporal correlation between frequency bands is a few percent .    for each observation",

    "we can also set conservative amplitude limits on free - free and synchrotron emission with the 408  mhz haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) map .",
    "if we convolve our scan pattern with the 30@xmath23 30  smoothed version of the map and assume antenna temperature scales as @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath3 1% of the observed structure at 3.5  @xmath0 for synchrotron emission ( @xmath25  =  -2.7 ) and @xmath3 10% of the observed structure at 3.5  @xmath0 for free - free emission ( @xmath25  =  -2.1 ) .      during the phi herculis observation the balloon altitude dropped to 32  km and fluctuated with an amplitude of several hundred feet every @xmath12 300  s. if we process the balloon altitude like a detector signal , removing offset and offset drift for each half scan and calculating a mean for each azimuth bin , we find that the 14  @xmath0 structure in phi herculis correlates ( -0.68 , null probability = 5@xmath26 ) with the binned balloon altitude .",
    "this strong correlation suggests that the observed structure is due to atmospheric contamination .",
    "we expect to observe less atmospheric emission during the hr5127 observation because the average balloon altitude was 35  km .    if all the structure at 14  @xmath0 is attributed to modeled atmospheric contamination , atmospheric emission contributes less than 5% of the observed structure at 3.5  cm  @xmath27 and 10% of the observed structure at 6  @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , the structure in the lower frequency bands is less correlated with the binned balloon altitude ( -0.09 , null probability  =  0.64 at 3.5  @xmath0 ; -0.17 , null probability = 0.39 at 6 @xmath0 ) . in our cmb analysis of phi herculis",

    "the gacf limits are as much as 20% lower than previously published ( @xcite ) .",
    "the previous max4 analyses did not include sufficient power in the off diagonal elements and improperly normalized the larger beam sizes in the theoretical covariance matrix .",
    "the distributed data sets , however , have not changed .",
    "these revised max4 lower values are closer to the values measured in the two scans reported here and for the region of sky near the star mu pegasi ( @xcite ) .",
