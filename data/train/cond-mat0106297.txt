    "the magneto - optical properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems have been intensively studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "it is known that in a dilute system confined in a so - called symmetric quantum well ( qw ) , the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum is determined by a charged - exciton complex @xmath4 ( bound state of two electrons @xmath6 and a valence hole @xmath7 ) and its interaction with the remaining electrons .",
    "the existence of @xmath4 in bulk semiconductors was predicted by lampert @xcite , but only in 2d quantum wells ( qw s ) does its binding energy turn out sufficiently large@xcite for the experimental detection .",
    "the observation of the @xmath4 stimulated theoretical work , and it is now established that the only bound @xmath4 state at zero magnetic field is the singlet state ( @xmath8 ) with the total electron spin @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , the pl spectrum usually shows two peaks , due to the @xmath3 ( neutral exciton ) and/or @xmath8 recombination , split by the @xmath8 binding energy @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is more complicated in a magnetic field @xmath11 . at very high @xmath11 ,",
    "the optically active @xmath3 s decouple from the electrons due to the `` hidden symmetry''@xcite and the @xmath8 unbinds .",
    "interestingly , a different @xmath4 state binds in high fields@xcite .",
    "it is a triplet ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 and finite total angular momentum .",
    "it has infinite radiative lifetime @xmath14@xcite because of ( independently ) the `` hidden '' and 2d translational symmetry , and thus will be further called @xmath15 ( @xmath0 for `` dark '' ) .",
    "although both symmetries are broken in experimental systems by mixing of landau levels ( ll s ) , valence band mixing effects , asymmetry of the qw , and disorder , the @xmath15 recombination is expected to be weak and disappear at very large @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that @xmath15 unbinds at @xmath16 while @xmath8 unbinds at high @xmath11 implies a singlet ",
    "triplet crossing , which in a gaas qw of width @xmath17  nm was predicted at @xmath18  t@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the following pl experiment@xcite showed no such transition up to @xmath19  t. this puzzle was resolved by the identification of another bound state , a radiative excited spin - triplet @xmath20 ( @xmath21 for `` bright '' ) @xcite . the emission spectrum from both triplets was eventually measured @xcite , and agrees well with the theoretical prediction@xcite .",
    "the fact that the pl spectrum of a 2deg in a symmetric qw only measures the @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 emission means that it is not a useful probe of electron correlations .",
    "the effect of surrounding 2deg on the @xmath4 emission is specially weak in dilute systems due to the laughlin correlations effectively isolating an @xmath4 from the electrons@xcite .",
    "indeed , the measured pl spectra are remarkably insensitive to the electron density@xcite , and only at filling factors @xmath22 approaching @xmath23 does the relative position of pl peaks change with density .    the pl spectra containing more information about the original ( laughlin ) electron correlations of the 2deg are obtained in asymmetrically doped wide qw s . in such structures , the spatial separation @xmath0 of @xmath6 and @xmath7 layers weakens the @xmath6@xmath7 interaction@xcite , and the pl spectra show discontinuities@xcite at the filling factor @xmath24 at which laughlin incompressible liquid state@xcite is formed and the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect@xcite is observed in transport experiments .",
    "the reason for these discontinuities is that at @xmath0 exceeding the magnetic length @xmath1 , the effective coulomb potential of the hole seen by the electrons is too weak and its resolution is too low , and a hole can no longer bind `` whole '' electrons to form @xmath4 s . instead , the hole interacts with charge excitations that are already present in the 2deg and which near @xmath24 happen to be a small number of laughlin quasiparticles ( qp s ) . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the hole repels positively charged quasiholes ( qh s ) and thus remains in the locally undisturbed incompressible electron state ( such state can be called a `` decoupled hole '' and denoted by @xmath7)@xcite .",
    "the situation is quite different at @xmath26 , when the hole attracts negatively charged quasielectrons ( qe s ) and binds one or two of them to form a fractionally charged exciton ( fcx ) , @xmath7qe or @xmath7qe@xmath27@xcite .    in this paper , we discuss results of numerical calculations of various radiative @xmath6@xmath7 complexes that contribute to the pl spectrum of a 2deg depending on @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "the energy and pl spectra are obtained from exact diagonalization in haldane spherical geometry@xcite .",
    "the presented unified description of the pl from the 2deg at high @xmath11 given in terms of emission from well defined bound states ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7qe@xmath28 ) reduces the problem of a very complicated interaction between a hole and the 2deg to a simpler one , of determining the single - particle properties of the bound `` quasiparticles '' .",
    "in particular , the optical selection rules for these states are formulated , following from the translational invariance .",
    "preserving the 2d translational symmetry of an infinite 2deg in a finite - size calculation turns out to be essential for the identification of the optical selection rules of bound @xmath6@xmath7 states and the degeneracies in their energy spectrum . for any system of electrons and/or holes ,",
    "this symmetry causes conservation of two orbital quantum numbers . for systems with total electric charge , @xmath29 ( such as @xmath4 ) , they are the total angular momentum @xmath30 and an additional angular momentum quantum number @xmath31 associated with a partial decoupling of the cm motion in a homogeneous magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the energy levels of a charged system fall into degenerate ll s labeled by @xmath32 , and the states within each ll have @xmath33 , 1 , 2 ,  .",
    "since both @xmath30 and @xmath31 commute with the pl operator @xmath34 , the following selection rule governs recombination of isolated charged @xmath6@xmath7 complexes : @xmath35 .    in order to confine electrons to a finite area ( in order to achieve finite degeneracy of electron and hole ll s ) without breaking the 2d symmetry , haldane @xcite proposed to put electrons and holes on a sphere of radius @xmath36 . the magnetic field",
    "@xmath11 perpendicular to the surface is due to a monopole placed in the center . the monopole strength @xmath37 is defined in the units of elementary flux @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 and the magnetic length is @xmath40 .",
    "the single - particle states are the eigenstates of angular momentum @xmath41 and its projection @xmath42 and are called monopole harmonics @xcite .",
    "the energies @xmath43 fall into @xmath44-fold degenerate angular momentum shells separated by the cyclotron energy @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46-th ( @xmath47 ) shell ( ll ) has @xmath48 and thus @xmath37 is a measure of the system size through the ll degeneracy . due to the spin degeneracy ,",
    "each shell is further split by the zeeman gap , @xmath49 .    as a result of 2d rotational invariance ,",
    "a many - body @xmath6@xmath7 system on a sphere has two good quantum numbers , length @xmath50 and projection @xmath51 of the total angular momentum @xmath52 .",
    "the mapping between quantum numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 on a plane and the 2d algebra of @xmath52 on a sphere allows conversion of the results between the two geometries@xcite .",
    "in particular , ll s of a charged @xmath6@xmath7 complex are represented on a sphere by @xmath50-multiplets , states within each ll are labeled by @xmath51 , and the optical selection rule is @xmath53 .",
    "the price paid for closing the many - body hilbert space without breaking the 2d symmetry is the surface curvature affecting interaction matrix elements .",
    "however , if the correlations modeled have short range @xmath54 , the effects of curvature ( scaled by a small parameter @xmath55 ) can be eliminated by extrapolation to @xmath56 .    using a composite index",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath65 is diagonalized numerically in the basis of @xmath66@xmath67 slater determinants",
    ". small density of holes is assumed which allows ignoring @xmath7@xmath7 interaction effects and inclusion of only one valence hole in the basis .",
    "the @xmath66@xmath67 eigenstates are labeled by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the most important factors that determine dimension of the hamiltonian matrix that must be diagonalized are the number of electrons @xmath69 , the ll degeneracy controlled by @xmath37 , the number of excited ll s included , and the inclusion of spin - unpolarized states . using modified lanczos algorithms we diagonalized hamiltonians of dimensions up to about @xmath70 . in the @xmath4 problem , the number of particles is small and the inclusion of reversed spins and ll s is possible . the numerical results for @xmath4 s agree well with recent experiments @xcite .",
    "however , when studying fcx s , as many electrons as possible need be included in the calculation , and the model must be simplified by assuming maximum spin polarization ( @xmath71 ) , neglecting excited ll s , and setting zero qw width , @xmath72 .",
    "this allowed for calculation for @xmath73 at @xmath74 , but the results are largely qualitative .",
    "the potential @xmath75 seen by the electrons due to the positive charge of the optically injected valence hole @xmath7 can be described by two effective parameters , strength @xmath76 and spatial resolution @xmath77 .",
    "the response of the 2deg to the perturbation @xmath75 depends on the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath78 and the characteristic energies and lengths of the unperturbed system .",
    "the pair of perturbation parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 in principle can be varied independently , but in experimental samples they are predominantly controlled through the effective spatial separation @xmath0 of the hole from the 2deg layer .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 depends on the electric field oriented across the 2deg plane and resulting from asymmetric doping . in symmetrically doped qw s ,",
    "the hole moves in the same physical layer as the electrons ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , in the asymmetrically ( one - sided ) doped qw s the displacement @xmath0 can be as large as the qw width @xmath80 .",
    "clearly , at @xmath79 both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the largest , and the strongest response of the 2deg to the hole can be expected .",
    "the actual magnitudes of @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath79 depend on the details of hole wave function , which to some extent depend on the magnetic field . in the extreme case of @xmath81 ( lowest ll approximation ) , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 wave functions are identical and the interaction hamiltonian is particle ",
    "hole symmetric@xcite .",
    "this `` hidden '' symmetry causes vanishing of all electric moments in the optically active ground state of a bound @xmath6@xmath7 pair ( @xmath3 ) , which in turn causes the decoupling of @xmath3 s from the 2deg . as a result",
    ", the @xmath3 is the most strongly bound optically active @xmath6@xmath7 state that can form in the 2deg . in the opposite case ,",
    "the ( infinitely heavy ) hole acts as a point charge and its attraction to an electron is larger by a factor of @xmath82 . in an intermediate situation",
    ", the enhanced @xmath6@xmath7 attraction always breaks the hidden symmetry and causes coupling of an @xmath3 to electrons . as a result , radiative @xmath4 states occur , and the @xmath4 rather than @xmath3 should be regarded the most stable bound state formed by a hole injected into the 2deg@xcite .",
    "this can be rephrased as that at finite @xmath11 and @xmath79 the 2deg responds to @xmath75 by binding two electrons to the hole to form an @xmath4 and screen the hole s positive charge .    in the other limit of large @xmath0 ,",
    "both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are too small to cause a strong response of an incompressible electron liquid .",
    "a hole is no longer able to pick out and bind a single electron from the 2deg , which can be understood by noticing that the elementary charge excitations of an unperturbed 2deg ( qe s and qh s ) have finite energy ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , and that the electron wave function in the vicinity of the hole that corresponds to an @xmath4 can be expanded in the basis of these qe and qh excitations . on the other hand , too large @xmath0 implies too large @xmath78 and the size of an isolated @xmath4 ( @xmath85@xmath67 ground state ) that would exceed the characteristic @xmath6@xmath6 distance @xmath86 ( @xmath87 means density ) and make such an @xmath4 unstable when inserted into the 2deg ( independently of the preceding energetic argument ) .",
    "the only allowed response of the 2deg to the hole in this ( `` weak '' ) coupling regime is to screen the hole s positive charge with the negatively charged qe s that are already present in the 2deg .",
    "the fact that only the existing qe s can bind to the hole makes the response critically depend on the filling factor @xmath22 .",
    "for example , near the laughlin filling of @xmath24 , the hole repels the qh s and moves in the locally incompressible @xmath24 liquid , causing no local response of the 2deg .",
    "conversely , the binding of one or more qe s to the hole is expected at @xmath26 , and the resulting bound fcx states @xmath7qe@xmath28 are the most stable bound states at large @xmath0 . since the `` uncoupled '' state @xmath7 has different emission energy @xmath88 and oscillator strength @xmath89 than the @xmath7qe@xmath28 s , discontinuity in the pl spectrum",

    "an isolated neutral ( @xmath3 ) or charged ( @xmath4 ) exciton consists of only two or three particles . in the numerical calculation of the energy and pl spectra of this relatively simple quantum mechanical system we were able to include the effects of the finite magnetic field @xmath11 that causes ll mixing ( by including up to five electron and hole ll s , @xmath90 , with the lowest ll degeneracy of @xmath91 ) and of the finite qw width @xmath80 ( by using the values of the two - body coulomb matrix elements appropriate for the lowest subband of the qw rather than for an ideal 2d system ) . it should be stressed that due to different electron and hole effective masses and due to a different height of the electron and hole confinement potential at the well / barrier interface , the electron and hole wave functions in the @xmath92-direction are different even in the symmetric structures with @xmath79 . to a first approximation ,",
    "this is included by introducing a pair of effective widths of the electron and hole layers , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , obtained by fitting the actual density profile @xmath95 of each carrier with @xmath96 . for a @xmath17  nm gaas / al@xmath97ga@xmath98as qw the effective widths are @xmath99  nm and @xmath100  nm .",
    "the zeeman energy @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the effective giromagnetic factor and @xmath103 is the bohr magneton ) enters the problem of an @xmath4 in two ways .",
    "( i ) because of the complete spin polarization of the 2deg , binding of an @xmath4 state may or may not require a spin flip , depending on the total spin @xmath68 of two electrons in the bound @xmath4 state .",
    "therefore , the binding energy @xmath104 of each spin triplet ( @xmath13 ) @xmath4 state is insensitive to the zeeman energy , but for spin singlet ( @xmath9 ) states @xmath104 is reduced by @xmath105 compared to the pure coulomb binding energy . for gaas , @xmath105 is roughly a linear function of energy through both cyclotron energy @xmath106 and confinement energy @xmath107 .",
