    "the rapid development of particle - physics - motivated cosmology represented mainly by superstring cosmology @xcite has led to a change of views onto the standard problems of inflationary cosmology such as the ( past ) horizon and flatness problems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the astronomical observations of supernovae ia @xcite strongly suggest that the universe not only had possibly accelerated at its early stages of evolution but it is also accelerating now .",
    "this puts strong constraints onto the matter content of the universe because only the exotic ( negative pressure ) matter in standard cosmology can lead to acceleration .",
    "however , a phenomenological nature of such an exotic matter in standard models expressed in terms of the perfect fluid does not seem to make enough connection with particle physics and that is why one is looking for other , more physical , descriptions . among them",
    "the main proposal is quintessence or time - dependent scalar field @xcite which substitutes an ordinary phenomenological barotropic fluid .",
    "however , there are other interesting proposals to express the phenomenon of acceleration which are related to superstring or m - theory models",
    ". the best known are pre - big - bang @xcite , brane @xcite and ekpyrotic models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we try to study the standard cosmology problems ( such as cosmic acceleration and past horizon problems ) within the framework of the brane universes .",
    "we do not study , for instance , the future horizon problem following the recent discussion inspired by the s - matrix formulation within the superstring theories @xcite . in the paper we are interested mainly in the early stage of the evolution of the universe",
    "although the supernovae data gives restrictions onto this stage and they should be taken into account .",
    "the idea of brane universes has been first presented by hoava and witten @xcite who considered strong coupling limit of heterotic @xmath0 superstring theory , i.e. , m - theory .",
    "this limit results in ` exotic ' @xcite kaluza - klein type compactification of @xmath1 , @xmath2 supergravity on a @xmath3 orbifold ( a unit interval ) in a similar way as compactification of @xmath4 , @xmath5 supergravity on a circle @xmath6 results in strongly coupled limit of type iia superstring theory . in hoava - witten theory there",
    "exist two 10-dimensional branes to which all the gauge interactions are confined , and they are connected via the orbifold , with gravity propagating in all 11 dimensions . after further compactification of hoava - witten models on a calabi - yau manifold one gets an effective 5-dimensional theory which has been applied to cosmology @xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite developed similar to hoava - witten scenario which was mainly motivated by the hierarchy problem in particle physics @xcite .",
    "as a result , they obtained a 5-dimensional spacetime ( bulk ) with @xmath7 symmetry with two / one 3-brane(s ) embedded in it to which all the gauge interactions are confined . in one - brane scenario",
    "@xcite the brane appears at the @xmath8 position , where @xmath9 is an extra dimension coordinate and the 5-dimensional spacetime is an anti - de sitter space with negative 5-dimensional cosmological constant . the extra dimension can be infinite due to the exponential ` warp ' factor in the metric @xmath10 + dy^2,\\ ] ] and @xmath11 gives the curvature scale of the anti - de sitter space . in the simplest case",
    "the induced metric on a brane is a minkowski metric ( energy momentum tensor of matter vanishes ) .",
    "however , the requirement to allow matter energy - momentum tensor on the brane leads to breaking of conformal flatness in the bulk , and the metric ( [ rsmet ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "this fact is obviously related to the appearance of the weyl curvature in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the full set of 5-dimensional and projected 4-dimensional equations has been presented in refs .",
    "global geometric properties of such brane models have also been studied ( see ref .",
    "generalized bulk spacetimes different from those of ( [ rsmet ] ) have been found in ref .",
    "anisotropic kasner branes have been immersed in ads bulk in ref .",
    "@xcite .    campos and sopuerta @xcite used the dynamical system methods to the analysis of the friedmann , bianchi i and v randall - sundrum brane world type cosmological models with a non - vanishing 5-dimensional weyl tensor .",
    "they considered the dynamics of this model in the form of a _ higher - than - two - dimensional _ dynamical system .",
    "exact analytic brane configurations with a vanishing weyl tensor with perfect and viscous fluid have been presented in refs .",
    "coley @xcite also studied the dynamics of these randall - sundrum models - he made a step towards mixmaster ( bianchi ix ) dynamics and found it was not chaotic provided the matter had positive pressure . in this paper",
    "we show that the dynamical system which describes the evolution of the brane models ( both isotropic ( frw ) and anisotropic ( bianchi i or bianchi v ) types ) can be represented in the simplest way in the form of a _ two - dimensional _ hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "such visualization has a great advantage because we _ avoid _ the problem of degeneracy of critical points which appeared in the _ higher dimensional _ phase space ( see ref .  [ 13 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the existence of such critical points is a possible reason for the structural instability of a model .",
    "on the other hand , the representation of dynamics as a one - dimensional hamiltonian flow allows to make the classification of possible evolution paths in the _ configuration space _ which is complementary to phase diagrams .",
    "it also makes simpler to discuss the physical content of the model .",
    "finally , the construction of the hamiltonian allows to study quantum cosmology on the brane as it was attempted in refs .",
    "@xcite , in full analogy to what is usually done in general relativity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of representation of dynamics as a one - dimensional hamiltonian flow . in this representation",
    "the phase diagrams in a two - dimensional phase space allow to analyze the _ acceleration and ( past ) horizon _ problems in a clear way .",
    "we reduce the dynamics to a two - dimensional phase space with an autonomous system of equations .",
    "we deal with the full global dynamics of brane models whose asymptotic states are represented by critical points of the system . from theoretical point of view",
    "it is important how large the class of accelerated models is .",
    "we will call this class of accelerated models typical / generic , if the domain of acceleration in the phase space is a non - zero measure . on the other hand , if only the non - generic ( zero - measure ) trajectories",
    "are represented by accelerated models , then the mechanism which drives these trajectories should be called ineffective .",
    "such a point of view is a consequence of the fact that , if the acceleration is an attribute of a trajectory which starts with a given initial conditions , it should also be an attribute of a trajectory which starts with a neighbouring initial conditions .",
    "our analysis of the brane - world type model may be considered as complementary to campos and sopuerta s analysis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . however , it is more advantageous in many points .",
    "it is because our dynamical system is a 2-dimensional system which is the smallest possible dimension to study isotropic cosmological systems of equations .",
    "this allows to avoid huge redundancy of degenerated critical points and trajectories which appear in a higher dimensional phase space ( cf .",
    "phase diagrams of @xcite ) so to the structural instability .",
    "finally , for a two - dimensional hamiltonian system one is able to study all its properties in a configuration space rather than in a phase space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present simple hamiltonian dynamics of the brane universes . in section 3",
    "we discuss cosmological models in configuration space , stability and the domains of the phase plane for which cosmic acceleration and horizon problem avoidance appear . in section 4",

    "the function @xmath34 enters as a contribution from the weyl tensor in the bulk .",
    "the shear scalar @xmath50 vanishes for the frw models , whereas for the anisotropic bianchi type models @xmath51 the first integral of the system ( [ eq:7])([eq:9 ] ) is the friedmann equation @xcite which reads as @xmath52 where @xmath53  the curvature index .",
    "one can easily see from ( [ eq:11 ] ) that in the limit @xmath54 one recovers general relativity .",
    "the main difference from the standard general relativistic friedmann equation is the appearance of the @xmath55 correction .",
    "this term comes as a contribution from the brane .",
    "however , in the general case within the framework of ads / cft correspondence @xcite this correction may come from higher - derivative terms in the curvature and higher - dimension operators connecting the on - brane matter directly to the cft @xcite .",
    "there are two invariant submanifolds : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "the intersection of these submanifolds is also an invariant .",
    "it is well - known that the first integral of the frw equation can be used to construct a hamiltonian function .",
    "we take advantage of this feature in the considered model .",
    "the integration of ( [ eq:8])([eq:9 ] ) gives @xmath58 therefore the right - hand side of the rayuchaudhuri equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the scale factor @xmath59 as @xmath60 a.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) can be rewritten in the form analogous to the newton equation of motion in the 1-dimensional configuration space @xmath61 @xmath62 where the potential function @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "another important conclusion from ( [ eq:15 ] ) is that for @xmath68 @xmath69 contribution dominates over shear anisotropy near singularity so the singularity in bianchi models ( especially in bianchi ix ) is isotropic and that there is no chaos @xcite .",

    "( [ eq:17 ] ) is that one is then easily able to canonically quantize the system and allow quantum cosmological framework on the brane @xcite in full analogy to general relativity @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtain the dynamics reduced to the hamiltonian flow in the 1-dimensional configuration space @xmath75 with @xmath66 given by ( [ eq:15 ] ) and @xmath76 .",
    "now the physical trajectories lie on _ the zero - energy level _ , @xmath77 , which coincides with the form of the first integral .     given by ( [ eq:15 ] ) for some trajectories depending on the initial conditions in the phase plane for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( dust )",

    "the formalism can simply be generalized to the case of a general form of the equation of state .",
    "we use this fact and consider the equation of state for the ( non - interacting ) mixture of dust - like matter ( @xmath82 ) and an unknown component , labelled @xmath83 , with negative pressure .",
    "it is assumed that dominant @xmath83-component is a perfect fluid with the equation of state specified by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which enables that component to induce accelerated expansion in standard general relativistic cosmology @xcite .",
    "the positive cosmological constant @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath86 .",
    "the supernovae observations indicate that the dimensionless energy density of x - component @xmath87 is large compared to dust - like matter ( @xmath88  natural order of magnitude of the vacuum energy ) @xcite .",
    "the best - fit component is with @xmath89 ( see paper 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "one often represents the @xmath83-component in terms of a scalar field @xmath90 ( e.g. , inflaton ) with a suitable potential ( quintessence ) @xcite .",

    "therefore the total energy @xmath97 changes as @xmath98 after substitution ( [ eq : a1 ] ) into ( [ eq : a2 ] ) we obtain @xmath99 = \\rho_{m0}a^{-3 } + \\rho_{x0 } a^{-3w_{x}}.\\ ] ]    then , the potential function is given by the integral @xmath100 a da,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is given by ( [ eq : a3 ] ) and @xmath102 comes from ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",

    "obviously the simplest possibility is the pure case of the unknown matter @xmath83 such that @xmath105 which gives the potential function @xmath106 i.e. , @xmath107 plays the role of @xmath108 in ( [ eq:15 ] ) .    as a special example",

    "namely , from the hamiltonian constraint @xmath118 we obtain the integral @xmath119 for some specific forms of the potential function ( [ eq:15 ] ) we can obviously obtain the exact solutions . however , this is not the task of our paper since we concentrate on qualitative analysis only .",
    "it is possible to make the classification of qualitative evolution paths by analyzing the characteristic curve which represents the boundary equation in the configuration space . for this purpose",
    "we consider the equation of zero velocity , @xmath120 , which represents the boundary in the configuration space . because @xmath121 the motion of the system is limited to the region @xmath122 .",
    "consider the boundary of the configuration space given by a condition @xmath123 the condition ( [ eq:24 ] ) together with ( [ eq:15 ] ) is equivalent to the equation of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant on the brane @xmath31 expressed as a function of @xmath67 : @xmath124 the plot of @xmath125 for different @xmath126 is shown in fig .",

    "we can see that in the latter case ( @xmath13 there is no static einstein universe .    , given by ( [ eq:25 ] ) , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( dust ) .",
    "lines @xmath127 gives qualitative classification of possible path evolutions .",
    "let us note that there is a similarity to the standard frw models .",
    "the maximum for @xmath128 corresponds to a static universe .",
    "the de sitter model starts at the initial singularity .",
    "the eddington model starts from the static universe at @xmath129 ( separatrices on the phase plane ) then reaches the singularity ( such that @xmath130 ) and evolves to infinity .",
    "the solutions are represented by levels of constant @xmath31 fixed above the @xmath125 curve .",
    "the domain under the characteristic curve is non - physical . ]    , given by ( [ eq:25 ] ) , for @xmath78 and @xmath81 ( domain walls ) .",
    "all models with @xmath131 and @xmath132 oscillate .",
    "these with @xmath128 are singularity free .",
    "the lines of constant @xmath133 above the @xmath125 curve represents the qualitative evolution of the model . ]",
    "finally , we consider the evolution path as a level of @xmath134 and then we classify all evolution modulo their quantitative properties of dynamics ( compare @xcite )",
    ". we can conclude that the classes of admissible models in brane scenario are _ qualitatively _ the same as in general relativity .",
    "the next advantage of representing dynamics in terms of hamiltonian is the possibility to discuss the stability of critical points which is only based on the geometry of the potential function , namely     if a diagram of the potential function @xmath66 has maxima then they correspond to _ unstable _ critical points ; on the other hand , if a diagram of the potential function has minima , they correspond to _ stable _ attractors .    ",
    "if a diagram of the potential function has an inflection point at @xmath135 , then the corresponding critical point in the phase plane is a _ saddle _ point .    in general ,",
    "the stability and the character of a critical point is determined by the hessian @xmath136 $ ] .    in our case the hamiltonian function ( [ eq:17 ] ) takes the simplest form for natural mechanical systems ( i.e. , with the kinetic energy quadratic in momenta , and the potential energy dependent on generalized coordinates only ) .",
    "then , the only possible critical points in a finite domain of phase space are centers and saddles .    the idea of structural stability originated with andronov and pontryagin @xcite . a dynamical system @xmath137 is said to be structurally stable if dynamical systems in the space of all dynamical systems are close , in the metric sense , to @xmath137 or are topologically equivalent to @xmath137 . instead of finding and analyzing an individual solution of a model ,",
    "a space of all possible solutions is investigated .",
    "a property is believed to be ` realistic ' if it can be attributed to large subsets of models within a space of all possible solutions or if it possesses a certain stability , i.e. , if it is shared by a slightly perturbed model .",
    "there is a wide opinion among specialists that realistic models should be structurally stable , or even stronger , that everything should possess a kind of structural stability . what does the structural stability mean in physics ?",
    "the problem is in principle open in more than 2-dimensional case where according to smale there are large subsets of structurally unstable systems in the space of all dynamical systems @xcite . for 2-dimensional dynamical systems , as in the considered case , the peixoto s theorem says that structurally stable dynamical systems on compact manifolds form open and dense subsets in the space of all dynamical systems on the plane .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to require the model of a real 2-dimensional problem to be structurally stable .    when we consider the dynamics of brane world models , then there is a simple test of structural stability .",
    "namely , if the right - hand sides of the dynamical systems are in polynomial form , the global phase portraits are structurally stable @xmath138 ( @xmath139 with a poincar sphere ) if and only if the number of critical points and limit cycles is finite , each point is hyperbolic and there are no trajectories connecting saddle points . in the considered case the points at infinity are revealed on the projective plane . two projective maps",
    "@xmath140 , @xmath141 cover a circle at infinity given by @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .    therefore",
    ", one can conclude that the _ brane - world models are structurally stable_. it holds because the potential function @xmath66 is convex up and then there are no non - hyperbolic centres .",
    "there are also no trajectories connecting saddle points .",
    "all these properties can be deduced from the geometry of the potential function @xmath66 .",
    "structural stability is sometimes considered as a precondition of the ` real existence ' .",
    "having too many drastically different mathematical models - all of them equally well fitting the observational data ( up to measurement errors ) - seems to be fatal for the empirical method of modern science @xcite .",
    "therefore , any 2-dimensional structurally unstable model is not of physical importance .    from the physical point of view",
    "it is interesting to answer the question : are the trajectories distributed in the phase space in such a way that critical points are typical or exceptional ? how are trajectories with interesting properties distributed ?",
    "for example , along which trajectories the acceleration condition , @xmath146 , is satisfied ?",
    "one can easily decuce this from the geometry of the potential function . in the phase space ,",
    "the _ area of acceleration _ is determined by @xmath147 or by the condition that @xmath148 from ( [ eq:26 ] ) we can see that in order to obtain acceleration , the _ positive _ 4-dimensional cosmological constant @xmath31 is necessary .",
    "it can easily be demonstrated that if @xmath149 as @xmath150 , then the corresponding world model has _ no particle horizon_. indeed , if there exists a constant @xmath151 such that for sufficiently large @xmath152 , @xmath153 , then @xmath154 the integral on the left hand - side of this formula diverges which means that the time @xmath155 goes to minus infinity , and that there are no causally disconnected regions . putting this in terms of variables @xmath156 one needs @xmath157 , @xmath158 for the horizon problem to be solved .",
    "now , from the hamiltonian constraint we obtain that as @xmath159 , then @xmath160 . therefore , if the _ horizon problem is solved _",
    ", then the curvature effects can not be neglected in the vicinity of an initial singularity .",
    "in this section we discuss the dynamics of the brane universes in a more detailed way .",

    "then , we have @xmath196 in this case , the term which comes from the brane and which is proportional to @xmath162 vanishes ( see eq .",

    "it can be checked that @xmath209 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath67 ( @xmath210 ) and @xmath211 , so there is a single point @xmath212 .    from ( [ eq:36 ] )",
    "we can also observe that as @xmath204 goes to zero then @xmath9 goes to infinity , which means that the model has a particle horizon ( @xmath31 is negligible and then @xmath213 ) .",
    "it is due to the presence of @xmath214 .",

    "one observes that the generic evolution of cosmological models without a horizon is when @xmath220 ( zero is also possible ) as @xmath150 .",
    "effects of @xmath31 are always negligible near a singularity and if @xmath221 we have always asymptotically @xmath222 . for @xmath216 and @xmath223 ( domain walls on the brane ) ,",
    "then @xmath66 goes to a constant and there is no horizon in the model .",
    "then , the generic behaviour near the singularity is @xmath224 , i.e. , it is milne s evolution ( in general relativity this appears for @xmath225 ( cosmic strings on the brane @xcite ) .",
    "independent observations of supernovae type ia , made by the supernovae cosmology project and the high @xmath226 survey team @xcite , indicate that our universe is currently accelerating .",
    "there is a fundamental problem for theoretical physics to explain the origin of this acceleration . if we introduce the cosmological constant @xmath31 and assume that the universe is flat , then the best - fit model is for the cosmological constant density parameter @xmath227 and for the dust density parameter equal to @xmath228 ( index `` 0 '' refers to the present moment of time ) .",
    "our formalism gives natural base to express dynamical equations in terms of dimensionless observational density parameters @xmath14 and to compare the results with supernovae data .",

    "it is easy to notice that the following cases can be exactly integrable in terms of elliptic functions @xcite : @xmath232 ( cosmological constant ) , @xmath13 ( domain - wall - like matter ) and @xmath225 ( cosmic strings ) .",
    "the first case is the easiest since in this case the first two terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ friedccc ] ) play the role of cosmological constants similar to @xmath31 .",
    "the next two cases involve terms which were already integrated in the context of general relativity .",
    "for @xmath13 ( domain - wall - like matter on the brane ) the general relativistic term with @xmath231 in ( [ friedccc ] ) scales as domain - walls in general relativity while the term with @xmath233 scales as cosmic string ( curvature ) in general relativity . for @xmath225 the term with @xmath233 scales as radiation in general relativity .",

    "we will not be doing this here .",
    "for other values of @xmath234 the terms of the type @xmath235 and @xmath236 appear and the integration involves hyperelliptic integrals .    coming back to observational quantities",

    "@xcite ) are useful in writing down an explicit redshift - magnitude formula ( generalized hubble law ) for the brane models to study their compatibility with astronomical data from supernovae .",
    "such a comparison will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we only study the formalism which allows to formulate our phase space quantities in terms of the observational parameters @xmath14 .",
    "let us consider a brane universe filled with an unknown type of matter with barotropic equation of state @xmath241 .",
    "then , it is useful to rewrite the dynamical equations to a new form using dimensionless quantities @xmath242    the basic dynamical equations are then rewritten as @xmath243 where @xmath244 .",
    "the above equations can be represented as a two - dimensional dynamical system @xmath245 as we have mentioned already the dynamics can be always reduced to the form of the friedmann models of general relativity with a certain kind of a non - interacting multifluid .",
    "of course , the dynamical system ( [ eq : b4])-([eq : b5 ] ) has the hamiltonian @xmath246 where @xmath247 , which should be considered on the zero - energy level .    as an example of application of these equations to study the problem of cosmic acceleration , consider the case of @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "it emerges that at present our universe accelerates provided that @xmath250 where @xmath251 refers to any type of matter @xmath83 with the equation of state @xmath252 ( for @xmath253 it is possible if @xmath254 ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new variable @xmath255 , then eq .",
    "( [ eq : b7 ] ) reduces to the quadratic inequality @xmath256    in the special case of the component @xmath83 in the form of the wall - like - matter @xmath257 , the universe accelerates if @xmath258 i.e. , if @xmath259 , @xmath260 , the universe always accelerates .",
    "in general , the domain of acceleration depends on the solution of the inequality ( [ eq : b8 ] ) .",
    "we assume that we are in the region of acceleration @xmath261 , @xmath260 and consider two cases .",

    "+ the universe accelerates for every @xmath204 .",
    "let us note that in case 1 the minimum value of @xmath204 can always be expressed in terms of redshift @xmath268 and from the inequality @xmath269 we obtain an additional restriction on parameters @xmath270 .",
    "in the paper we studied the dynamics of randall - sundrum brane universes with isotropic friedmann geometry . our approach is the simplest in that we formulate the problem in a 2-dimensional phase space and not in a higher - dimensional phase space as it has been done recently .",
    "first of all , this is the smallest possible dimension to study the isotropic cosmological systems of equations .",
    "then , it allows to _ avoid _ the degeneracy of critical points and trajectories which appear in a higher dimensional phase space and so to _ avoid _ structural instability of these models . also , since the system is hamiltonian one is able to study its properties in a one - dimensional configuration space rather than in phase space . in such a space",
    "the motion of the universe point is reduced to the motion of a particle with the potential energy @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the scale factor ( see section 2 ) . on the other hand , hamiltonian formulation",
    "can easily be applied to quantum cosmology on the brane .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] we can see that there is no qualitative difference in the shapes of the potential function @xmath66 as @xmath108 varies for cases under studies .",
    "only the values of @xmath67 for which the potential is negative have the physical meaning .",
    "the maximum of the potential function corresponds to an unstable saddle point on a phase diagram ( a critical point solution of the zero energy level ) .",
    "the de sitter solution is a point at infinity .",
    "near the initial singularity we have a solution @xmath271 which differs from a general relativistic one @xmath272 .    from the theory of qualitative differential equations in sections 3 and 4 we obtained the visualization of the system evolution in the phase plane @xmath273 and analyzed the asymptotic states and concluded that the brane models are _ structurally stable_. we studied the solution of the ( past ) horizon problem and the initial conditions for acceleration of our universe .",
    "we have the neat interpretation of _ a domain of acceleration _ as a domain in configuration space where the potential function decreases .",
    "therefore from the observation of the potential function @xmath66 , we can see the acceleration domain @xmath274 , with @xmath275 , which is independent of the curvature index @xmath126 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ( past ) horizon problem is solved when @xmath276 ( may be equal to zero ) as @xmath150 .",
    "if we find trajectories for which @xmath277 goes to infinity as @xmath278 , then the horizon is present in such a model .",
    "this is the case of dust brane model as well as a brane world filled with domain - wall - like matter with @xmath13 .    in general our model",
    "does not solve the horizon problem due to the existence of matter dominated phase of the early evolution where the term @xmath69 dominates and so @xmath279 ( @xmath280 ) . only in the special case of heavy domain - wall - like matter ( @xmath281 )",
    "the horizon problem is solved , because the evolution near the singularity dominated by matter ( brane tension ) is @xmath282 . however , the existence of such a singularity requires @xmath283 ( weyl tensor contribution from the bulk vanishes ) .",
    "therefore , the case @xmath281 is strictly distinguished because as @xmath157 then @xmath158 . for @xmath13 the term @xmath284 vanishes and brane effects are negligible .    in the phase portraits we can observe similarities as well as differences in both considered cases . in the dust - like matter case",
    "there is a quasi - static stage first discussed by lematre ( called ` loitering stage ' in @xcite ) .",
    "such quasi - static stages , present in the case of wall - like - matter , corresponds to configurations in the vicinity of a critical point .",
    "the acceleration does not depend on the value of @xmath285 , but in the phase space there are different sets of initial conditions which provide acceleration .",
    "we conclude that the classes of admissible models in brane scenario are _ qualitatively _ the same as in general relativity , i.e. , there exists a homeomorphism in the phase space which transforms trajectories of brane models into general relativistic ones without a change of orientation .",
    "however , _",
    "quantitatively _ the models differ from general relativistic ones - for instance , they asymptote the singularity in a different way .    finally , we reformulated the phase space quantities interms of the observational parameters @xmath14 and presented the formalism in which one is able to perform the observational tests ( redshift - magnitude relation ) of brane models which we will address in a separate paper .",
