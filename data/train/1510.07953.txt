    "the present phase of an accelerated expansion of the universe stands as one of the most challenging open problems in modern cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "this acceleration is characterized by which is popularly known as dark energy . among many possible alternatives ,",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the vacuum energy which is mathematically equivalent to the cosmological constant .",
    "models with different decay laws for the variation of cosmological term were investigated during the last two decades in a non covariant way , ( chen & wu 1990 ) ; ( abdel 1990 ) ; ( pavon 1991 ) ; ( carvalho et al 1992 ) ; ( kalligas et al 1992 ) ; ( lima & maia 1994 ) ; ( lima & carvalho 1994 ) ; ( lima & trodden 1996 ) ; ( arbab & abdel 1994 ) ; ( birkel & sarkar 1997 ) ; ( silveira & waga 1997 ) ; ( starobinsky 1998 ) ; ( overduin & cooperstock 1998 ) ; ( vishwakarma 2000,2001 ) ; ( arbab 2001,2003,2004 ) ; ( cunha & santos 2004 ) ; ( carneiro & lima 2005 ) ; ( fomin et al 2005 ) ; ( sola & stefancic 2005,2006 ) ; ( pradhan et al 2007 ) ; ( jamil & debnath 2011 ) and ( mukhopadhyay 2011 ) ; in particular , in fomin et al ( 2005 ) there are several evolution relations for @xmath2 which many author have used , also in ref .",
    "overduin & cooperstock ( 1998 ) appears a table with these relations and the corresponding references where they were considered .",
    "anisotropic cosmological models , also has been treated in this formalism from different points of view ( aroonkumar 1993,1994 ) ; ( arbab 1997 ) ; ( singh et al 1998 ) ; ( pradhan & kumar 2001 ) ; ( pradhan 2003,2007,2009 ) ; ( pradhan & pandey 2003,2006 ) ; ( pradhan et al 2007,2008 ) ; ( carneiro 2005 ) ; ( esposito et al 2007 ) ; ( bal & singh 2008 ) ; ( belinchn 2008 ) ; ( singh et al 2008 ) , ( singh et al 2013 ) ; ( shen 2013 ) ; ( tripathy 2013 ) and ( rahman & ansary 2013 ) .    in this work we present an analysis in covariant way , using the lagrangian density of standard scalar field . the main idea arises by proposing that as in the cosmological constant case , the scalar potential is identified as @xmath1 , with @xmath2 a constant .",
    "so , we _ extend _ this idea and suggest that this correspondence is valid even when this cosmological term has a temporal dependence , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "we include a barotropic equation state between the pressure and energy density of the scalar field , @xmath6 , quantities that we shall define in the following lines . in order to built up the analysis presented here , initially we solve the klein - gordon equations , whose solution implies that the energy density of a scalar field has a wide range of scaling behavior , @xmath7 with a the scale factor of the frw model , ( ferreira & joyce 1998 ) ; ( liddle & sharrer 1998 ) and ( copeland et all 1998 ) , that emerges as a proportionality law between the energy density of the scalar field and the energy density of the barotropic perfect fluid , relation that is know as an `` attractor solution '' , with the proportionality constant @xmath8 ( liddle & sharrer 1998 ) , that is , @xmath9",
    ". however the nature of the matter that corresponds to the scalar field is unknown since this matter is not detectable by the usual methods .",
    "the research in non covariant way goes by beginning with the relation when the cosmological term @xmath10 , often treated as a constant , having a geometrical interpretation . for",
    "explain this , the einstein field equation is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the usual einstein tensor and @xmath13 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "when we take the covariant divergence of this equation , the vanishing of the einstein tensor is guaranteed by the bianchi identities , then it is assumed that the energy - momentum tensor satisfies the corresponding conservation law @xmath14 , and that the covariant divergence of cosmological term must vanish , this implies that @xmath15 .",
    "usually , this argument situates this cosmological constant on the left - hand side of the field equations , given a geometrical interpretation of the cosmological term .    however , if the cosmological term is moved to the right - hand side of the field equation , the interpretation of @xmath16 change as part of the matter content in the following sense .",
    "the field equations now are written as @xmath17 once this is done , there is no a priori reason why this cosmological term should not vary , considering that it is the effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath18 that satisfies the conservation law @xmath19 .",
    "the set of equation ( [ efe - n ] , [ c - l ] ) and one state equation , are the fundamental tools to do the research , considering a variable cosmological term in non covariant way , because there is no a lagrangian density that reproduce these field equations ( [ efe - n ] , [ c - l ] ) .    in the present treatment we take into account the corresponding lagrangian density with a scalar field @xmath20=\\sqrt{-g}\\left(r-\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu \\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\phi\\nabla_\\nu\\phi   + v(\\phi)\\right)+\\sqrt{-g } { \\cal l}_{matter}\\label{lagra}\\ ] ] where r is the ricci scalar ,",
    "@xmath21 correspond to a barotropic perfect fluid , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the energy density and p is the pressure of the fluid in co - moving frame and @xmath24 is the barotropic constant .",
    "the corresponding variation of ( [ lagra ] ) , with respect to the metric and the scalar field gives the einstein and klein - gordon field equations @xmath25 from ( [ camrel ] ) it can be deduced that the energy - momentum tensor associated with the scalar field is @xmath26 + and the corresponding tensor for a barotropic perfect fluid becomes @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the four - velocity in the comoving frame .",

    "<S> the main idea arises by proposing that as in the cosmological constant case , the scalar potential is identified as @xmath1 , with @xmath2 a constant , this identification should be kept even when the cosmological term has a temporal dependence , i.e. , @xmath3 . </S>",
