    "in many physical problems , the model is formulated in backgrounds having boundaries on which the dynamical variables obey prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "the boundaries can have different physical origins , like interfaces between two media with different electromagnetic properties in condensed matter physics , horizons in gravitational physics , domain walls of various physical nature in the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena , branes in string theory and in higher - dimensional cosmologies .",
    "in quantum field theory , the imposition of boundary conditions on a field operator gives rise to modifications of the spectrum for the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field and , as a result , to the change of physical characteristics of the vacuum state , such as the energy density and vacuum stresses . as a consequence of this ,",
    "vacuum forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "this is the familiar casimir effect , first predicted for the electromagnetic field by casimir in 1948 @xcite .",
    "this effect can have important implications on all scales , from subnuclear to cosmological , and it has been investigated for various types of bulk and boundary geometries ( for reviews see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the features of the casimir forces depend on the nature of a quantum field , on the type of the spacetime manifold , on the geometry of boundaries , and on the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field .",
    "the explicit dependence can be found for highly symmetric geometries only .    in consideration of the casimir effect , usually , the boundaries separate the regions with different electromagnetic properties ( for example , media with different dielectric permittivities ) .",
    "another type of effect related to the casimir physics arises in a class of models with boundaries separating the spatial regions with different gravitational backgrounds .",
    "it can be referred to as gravitationally induced casimir effect .",
    "the different gravitational backgrounds on both sides of the separating boundary can correspond to different vacuum states of the same theory .",
    "for example , one can consider a bubble of a false vacuum embedded in true vacuum or vice versa .",
    "simple examples of vacuum bubbles are de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes embedded in the minkowski spacetime . in these examples ,",
    "a physical boundary separates two regions with different values of the cosmological constant .",
    "it serves as a thin - wall approximation of a domain wall interpolating between two coexisting vacua ( for a discussion see klin05 ) .    in a configuration with coexisting gravitational backgrounds ,",
    "the geometry of one region affects the properties of the quantum vacuum in the other region .",
    "previously , we have considered several examples of this type of vacuum polarization . in @xcite ,",
    "the casimir densities are investigated for a scalar field in the geometry of a cosmic string for a core with finite support . in the corresponding model ,",
    "the cylindrical boundary separates two different background geometries : the spacetime outside the boundary is described by the idealized cosmic string geometry with a planar angle deficit and for the interior geometry a general cylindrically symmetric static model is employed .",
    "two specific models of the core have been considered : the ballpoint pen model @xcite , with a constant curvature interior metric , and the flower pot model @xcite with an interior minkowskian spacetime .",
    "similar problems for the exterior geometry of a global monopole are discussed in beze06b and @xcite for scalar and fermionic fields , respectively . in the corresponding models the boundary separating different spatial geometries is a sphere . the model with a sphere as a boundary and with an exterior",
    "ds metric , described in planar inflationary coordinates , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor induced by a @xmath0-symmetric brane with finite thickness located on ads background are evaluated in saha07,saha08 for a massive scalar field .",
    "the general case of a static plane symmetric interior structure for the brane is considered , and the exterior ads geometry is described in poincar coordinates . in the corresponding problem the separating boundaries are plane symmetric .    in the present paper , we consider the vacuum densities for a massive scalar field with a general curvature coupling parameter in a spherically symmetric static geometry described by two distinct metric tensors inside and outside a spherical boundary .",
    "in addition , the presence of a surface energy - momentum tensor located on the separating boundary is assumed . among the most important characteristics of the quantum vacuum",
    "are the expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "although the corresponding operators are local , due to the global nature of the vacuum state , they carry an important information about the global properties of the bulk . moreover , in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor acts as a source of gravity in the quasiclassical einstein equations",
    "consequently , it plays a crucial role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics of the background spacetime . for the evaluation of the vevs",
    "we first construct the positive frequency wightman function by the direct summation over a complete set of scalar modes .",
    "this function also determines the excitation probability of a unruh - dewitt detector ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantum effects induced by distinct geometries in the exterior and interior regions should be taken into account , in particular , in discussions of the dynamics of vacuum bubbles during the phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the background spacetime under consideration and the matching conditions on a spherical boundary separating the interior and exterior geometries .",
    "a complete set of normalized mode functions for a scalar field with a general curvature coupling parameter is constructed in section [ sec : modes ] . by using the mode functions , in section [ sec : wf ]",
    "we evaluate the positive frequency wightman function for the general case of static spherically symmetric interior and exterior geometries .",
    "this function is presented in the form where the contribution induced by the interior geometry is explicitly separated .",
