    "voids can be thought of as large volumes with very low galaxy density surrounded by the walls and filaments of the cosmic web .",

    "( 1981 ) and geller & huchra ( 1989 ) .",
    "soon after their discovery , white ( 1979 ) , hoffman & shaham ( 1982 ) and peebles ( 1982 ) derived theoretical statistical properties of voids and related them to the gravitational instability scenario .",
    "einasto , einasto & gramann ( 1989 ) also estimated sizes of voids in different samples of galaxies in redshift surveys and compared their results with numerical simulations .",
    "the characteristics of voids in the galaxy distribution , such as the void probability distribution were studied by vogeley et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , whereas the fraction of the total volume in the universe occupied by voids , which was found to add up to about @xmath12 , was measured by el - ad & piran ( 1997 , 2000 ) , plionis & basilakos ( 2002 ) , and hoyle & vogeley ( 2002 ) .",
    "peebles ( 2001 ) presents a detailed review of the observational works devoted to void statistics .",
    "more recently , theoretical studies on the characteristics of voids and their surrounding structure have concentrated on several different aspects .",
    "for instance , van de weygaert ( 2004 ) presented an excursion set approach ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ) for predicting the distribution function of void sizes and its evolution with redshift .",
    "patiri et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also carry out an excursion set study on voids , and are able to characterize the number density of voids as a function of void radius as well as the mass function of haloes in voids .",
    "their model takes into account the fact that the properties of voids depend on the haloes used to identify them ( gottlber et al . , 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "based on this result , patiri et al .",
    "provide a framework which allows a comparison between theoretical predictions and statistical measures of voids found in the distribution of the visible galaxies that populate haloes .",
    "also , taking into account the nearly spherical average shape of voids , ryden ( 1995 ) showed that it is possible to use the cosmologically induced redshift - space distortion in the apparent shape of intermediate redshift voids to measure the deceleration parameter , @xmath13 .    on the observational side ,",
    "only very recently it has become possible to perform accurate statistical studies of voids using real data .",
    "for instance , croton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) to measure the reduced void probability function ( rvpf ) , which connects the distribution of voids to the higher moments of galaxy counts in cells .",
    "these new redshift surveys also allow the study of the population of galaxies inside voids .",
    "hoyle et al . ( 2003 ) use the sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) to study the luminosity function of void galaxies , which they find by setting an upper limit on the local density contrast at the galaxy position , @xmath14 .",
    "they find that galaxies are fainter in voids , but that the faint - end slope of the luminosity function , is consistent with that of galaxies in higher density environments . also using the sdss , goldberg et al .",
    "( 2004 ) study the mass function of void galaxies selected using the same density threshold as hoyle et al .",

    "we carry out a comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical and spatial properties of galaxies , dark - matter particles and haloes with respect to void centres .",
    "we study how the properties of voids identified from the distribution of dark - matter particles and haloes in a simulation relate to those of voids identified from the galaxy distribution .",
    "goldberg et al .",
    "find that galaxies trace the distribution of mass within voids , a fact that contrasts with the large biases expected in higher density environments , such as walls , filaments and clusters .",
    "since these objects set the boundaries of voids , this study provides a useful insight on the global segregation pattern of dark - matter and galaxies .",
    "the study of the effects of observational biases occurring in flux limited redshift surveys , and an application of the statistics presented here to observational catalogues are carried out in a forthcoming paper , ceccarelli et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : voids ] describes the semi - analytical numerical simulation used in this work and the procedure adopted for identifying voids in the simulation box .",
    "section [ sec : vpecs ] analyses the outflow signatures that characterise the regions surrounding voids . in section",
    "[ sec : correlations ] we study the spatial 2-point cross - correlation functions between voids and different tracers , dark - matter particles , haloes and galaxies .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] summarises our results and presents the main conclusions extracted from this work .",
    "in this work we study void statistics using a @xmath1cdm numerical simulation which contains @xmath15 million dark matter particles and @xmath16 million galaxies from the galform semi - analytic galaxy formation model ( cole et al .",
    "2000 ) , kindly provided by the durham group .",
    "there are approximately @xmath17 dark - matter haloes with at least @xmath18 members , identified from the distribution of datk - matter particles in the simulation using a friends - of - friends ( fof from now on ) algorithm with a linking length @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting haloes are characterised by a minimum mass of @xmath20h@xmath3m@xmath4 , a median mass @xmath21h@xmath3m@xmath4 , and a maximum @xmath22h@xmath3m@xmath4 .",
    "it should be noticed that the fof algorithm does not resolve substructure within the dark - matter haloes .",
    "the semi - analytic model output consists of approximately @xmath23 million galaxies with @xmath0 at @xmath24 ( from now on , we will refer to all galaxies above this magnitude limit , simply as galaxies ) in the simulation .",
    "the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 percentiles of the haloes hosting at least one galaxy are @xmath28h@xmath3m@xmath4 , @xmath29h@xmath3m@xmath4 , and @xmath30h@xmath3m@xmath4 respectively .",
    "we now describe the simulation parameters : the box side measures @xmath31h@xmath3mpc , the matter density parameter corresponds to @xmath32 , the value of the vacuum density parameter is @xmath33 , the hubble constant , @xmath34kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , with @xmath35 , and the primordial power spectrum slope is @xmath36 .",
    "the present day amplitude of fluctuations in spheres of @xmath37h@xmath3mpc is set to @xmath38 .",
    "this particular cosmology is in line with recent cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( wmap , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and large scale structure ( 2dfgrs , percival et al .",
    "2004 ) measurements .",
    "we use this simulation to study the dynamical and spatial characteristics of galaxies , dark - matter haloes and dark - matter particles around voids . throughout this paper ,",
    "errors in the statistics are calculated using the jackknife method , which has been shown to provide equivalent errors to those found by applying the statistics to a large number of independent simulations and measuring a variance ( see for instance , croton et al .",
    "2004 , padilla & baugh , 2003 ) .",
    "these results indicate that jackknife errors provide a reasonable estimate of statistical uncertainties and cosmic variance .",
    "the use of semi - analytic numerical simulations allows a comparison of galaxy- , halo- and mass - defined voids , since the population of galaxies in the simulation box is physically motivated , subject to evolution via mergers , metal enrichment , dust evolution , and other important astrophysical processes ( for full details see cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we compare results from real- and redshift - space derived quantities .",
    "when referring to voids this indicates that , when identifying voids in the simulation , the positions of particles , haloes or galaxies were considered either in real- or redshift - space .",
    "we implement redshift - space positioning in this simulation by displacing the @xmath39coordinates of particles and galaxies by the @xmath39component of their velocities in units of h@xmath3mpc ( distant observer looking down the @xmath39axis ) .    in the next subsections",
    "we describe the void finding algorithm , present the resulting number density of voids as a function of void radius , and calculate the void auto - correlation function .",
    "= 8.truecm    = 11.truecm      we find voids in the simulation by identifying spherical volumes where the overall density contrast satisfies @xmath40 , which corresponds to a usual definition of an under - dense region .",
    "later in this section we find that small variations on this condition do not affect significantly our statistics .",
    "we use the mass , dark - matter haloes , and the galaxies in the simulation to find voids , and we also investigate in a simple way the effects of redshift space distortions in the identification of voids .",
    "therefore , we produce ten different catalogues of voids in the numerical simulation .",
    "we first have @xmath41 sets of voids , found in the distribution of dark - matter ( which we will refer to as mass - defined voids ) , haloes with masses above @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44h@xmath3m@xmath45 ( halo - defined voids , also referred to as h@xmath46- , h@xmath47- and h@xmath48-defined voids respectively ) , h11.5 by @xmath49 , and h12 haloes by @xmath50 , and voids found in the distribution of galaxies ( referred to as galaxy - defined voids ) in real space . repeating the identification in redshift - space provides us with the remaining @xmath41 samples .    for each of these different samples of voids , the procedure followed is exactly the same , and comprises the following steps :    * we produce a large number of random positions which will be used to test whether the density contrast in spheres centred on these positions satisfies the condition @xmath51",
    "the higher the number of random positions the higher the accuracy in finding the true centre of a void in the simulation . *",
    "we calculate the density contrast as a function of radius of a sphere centred on the random positions generated in the first step .",
    "* we identify the radii for which the void density criterion @xmath51 is satisfied . in the event where this condition is satisfied more than once at different radii",
    ", we only consider the largest radius . * up to this point , the outcome of the identification process will likely consist of a large number of underdense overlaping spheres .",
    "therefore , the last step consists of removing all spheres overlapping with a larger void .",
    "for instance , this last step will make a large underdense spherical region of radius @xmath52 be represented by a single sphere of radius @xmath52 , instead of by many spheres of smaller radius that could be able to fill the underdense volume .",
    "the nature of the finding algorithm makes voids of comparable sizes at similar positions be simply replaced by a larger void which naturally occupies the volume of all the smaller voids together .",
    "we have made several checks to make sure the void finding algorithm is reliable .",
    "we have varied the upper limit in @xmath53 up to @xmath54 , and find that in general results are not significantly affected in the case of galaxy- and halo - defined voids .",
    "the main difference resides in the appearance of large spurious ( @xmath55h@xmath3mpc ) voids .",
    "we have also checked that the removal of overlapping voids does not affect significantly the mean values of the statistics we investigate in this work by allowing for instance , voids within voids .",
    "it is important , however , to take this effect into account when calculating errors , since many slightly de - centred voids representing only one physical void in the simulation artificially lowers the size of statistical errors .    given that dark - matter particles outnumber galaxies by a factor @xmath56 in the simulation , we tested for the impact of the number of particles in the identification procedure . in order to do this",
    "we select @xmath57th of the total dark - matter particles and run our void identification algorithm .",
    "the resulting void catalogue is almost identical to the one found from the full simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : pos ] shows a slice of the simulation box with the distribution of semi - analytic galaxies and the positions of voids found by our procedure . in order to improve clarity , in this particular plot we only show voids with radii in the range @xmath58h@xmath3mpc . as can be seen , the void identification algorithm is quite satisfactory , picking out low density regions with void radii compatible with the observed galaxy distribution .",
    "the empty spaces not filled with voids are expected for instance from voids with @xmath59h@xmath3mpc , or voids with centres outside the slice shown in this figure .",
    "the first statistic we measure using the voids identified in the previous subsection is the number density as a function of void radius , @xmath60 .",
    "we show the measured results from the simulation box in the upper panel of figure [ fig : numdens ] , where the red ( gray ) lines correspond to voids found from the spatial distribution of galaxies and the blue ( black ) lines from the mass .",
    "solid lines correspond to real - space , dashed lines to redshift - space .",
    "symbols show the results from the distribution of voids identified from haloes of different masses as indicated in the key .",
    "it is noticeable the good agreement between these estimates for @xmath61h@xmath3mpc , where all the void number densities are virtually indistinguishable . at larger",
    "object / void - centre separations the different estimates start to diverge",
    ". for instance the difference between real- and redshift - space estimates can diverge by as much as a factor of @xmath62 , as is the case at large mass - void radii @xmath63h@xmath3mpc .",
    "this is attributable to the fingers of god effect which takes place in the void walls and displaces dark - matter particles from the walls and dilutes the void boundaries .",
    "galaxy- and halo - void number densities are not significantly affected by a redshift - space identification of voids as expected , since the peculiar velocities of mass and galaxies are small ( @xmath64 ) compared to the void sizes .",
    "the difference between number densities of voids found from the distribution of galaxies and mass starts to be noticeable at separations @xmath65h@xmath3mpc ; eventually there are no longer mass - defined voids with @xmath63h@xmath3mpc whereas it is still possible to identify galaxy - defined voids with @xmath66h@xmath3mpc .",
    "the number density of halo - defined voids is more comparable to that of galaxy - defined voids .",
    "the increase in the number density of voids with the mass of the haloes used to identify them can be understood in terms of the bias factor between haloes and the mass .",
    "higher mass haloes are more strongly biased with respect to the mass , and therefore are preferably found in high mass density regions , which correspond preferably to the centres of void walls and filaments .",
    "the net effect this would have is to increase the radius of the void when identified from a biased population of objects , and would explain the apparent increase in number density observed in figure [ fig : numdens ] .    from the number density of voids , it is straight - forward to obtain the fraction of volume inside voids in the simulation .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : numdens ] , shows the volume inside voids with @xmath67 .",
    "as can be seen , the difference between mass- and galaxy - defined voids is even more evident here . also , it is now possible to recognise a good agreement between galaxy - defined voids and h@xmath47- for @xmath68h@xmath3mpc and h@xmath48-defined with @xmath69h@xmath3mpc voids .",
    "this demonstrates that caution should be taken when analysing properties of galaxy - defined voids , which can differ from those of halo- and mass - defined voids . as mentioned above",
    ", the reason for this discrepancy is the slightly biased nature of the galaxy distribution in this simulation with respect to the dark - matter particles and haloes . in particular , the spatial distribution of galaxies shows larger and more numerous voids than the distributions of mass or low mass haloes ( less biased populations ) .",
    "given that the redshift - space effect enhances the number density of mass - defined voids more strongly , the differences between results from mass- and galaxy - defined voids are less important in redshift - space .",
    "the volume fraction inside voids can be as large as @xmath70 , a value which is slightly lower than estimates from redshift surveys of @xmath12 by el - ad & piran , 1997 , 2000 , plionis & basilakos , 2002 , and hoyle & vogeley , 2002 . as pointed out above",
    ", our estimate of the volume fraction is only an order of magnitude estimate at best , since our simulated volume is limited and we might be badly affected by sampling statistics in the large - volume end of the void population .",
    "( 230,440 ) ( 0,0 ) ( -7,165 )      a simple statistics that can be applied to the void positions is the 2-point auto - correlation function . the advantages in studying the correlation function relies in its widespread use and in its direct connection to the power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : xivoids ] shows the auto - correlation function of galaxy- ( symbols ) and h@xmath48- and h@xmath47-defined voids ( dashed , @xmath71h@xmath3m@xmath45 , solid , @xmath2h@xmath3m@xmath45 ) for different void radii ( gray scale and different symbols as indicated in the figure caption ) . ,",
    "@xmath72 , and @xmath73 , for the three ranges of void radii shown in figure [ fig : xivoids ] ( smaller to larger void radii , respectively ) , which explains the noise present in the correlation functions of voids of large radius .",
    "] as can be seen , larger voids are more strongly clustered , and show a positive correlation signal out to larger separations .",
    "the amplitude of these correlations , however , is quite low and we only find a significant signal out to scales @xmath74h@xmath3mpc .",
    "it is interesting to note that at scales larger than @xmath75h@xmath3mpc , the slopes of the correlation functions for voids of different radii are similar .",
    "the auto - correlation function of voids defined using the most massive haloes ( h@xmath48 , dashed lines ) provides the best match to the clustering of galaxy - defined voids .    in order to assess whether the correlation function responds to an effect of the void identification procedure , we show in the lower panel of figure [ fig : xivoids ] the average correlation function ( and @xmath76 confidence region ) of @xmath77 sets of randomly placed spheres ( random - voids ) .",
    "each of these sets has the same number density as a function of radius than galaxy - defined voids , and also follows the exclusion constraints set for the identification of galaxy - defined voids .",
    "also , random - voids are placed in a volume with the same size as the simulation box .",
    "as can be seen , the exclusion constraint alone can produce a non - zero correlation function consistent with a power law of index @xmath78 .",
    "the comparison with the galaxy - defined voids correlation function , however , shows that the amplitude of the galaxy - void correlation function is still significantly higher than that of the random - voids .",
    "this could be interpreted as evidence of the influence of hierarchical clustering in the spatial distribution of galaxy - defined voids .",
    "we also calculated the correlation function of sets of random - voids with a different number density as a function of void radius , in particular , similar to that of h@xmath46-defined voids .",
    "we find that the comparison between h@xmath46-defined voids and this new set of random - voids is identical to the comparison we carry out above , namely that the correlation function of h@xmath46-defined voids is higher in amplitude than that of random - voids for small separations .",
    ".5 cm    our preliminary conclusion from the study of the number density of voids and void auto - correlation functions in the numerical simulation is that galaxy - defined voids show good agreement with voids identified from moderate to high mass haloes ( @xmath2h@xmath3m@xmath45 ) . from now on ,",

    "just as it has recently become possible to study the peculiar velocity field around groups ( ceccarelli et al .",
    "2004b , c05 from now on ) , which is characterised by infall galaxy motions toward the group centres , it is also possible to study outflows of material escaping the void volumes .",
    "a further motivation to study the outflow motions is that as has been shown by c05 , the infall motions of mass and galaxies are almost identical , being the galaxy infalls only slightly higher than the mass infalls .",
    "it may be possible then , to obtain a reliable measurement of the bulk outflows of mass emptying the void volumes by studying the velocities of galaxies around voids .",
    "we set out to compare the outflows of mass , dark - matter haloes , and galaxies from the simulated void catalogues constructed in this work . in order to do this",

    "it can be seen that mass - defined voids show a much lower and steeper maximum velocity relation when compared to galaxies , which show a difference of @xmath102kms@xmath3 at @xmath103h@xmath3mpc with respect to the results from mass - defined voids . in this case , it is not possible to decide which sample of halo - defined voids provides the closest outflow velocities to the galaxies , since the data from each halo sample are consistent with the galaxy - void data ( which shows considerable scatter around the best fit line ) .",
    "still , the results from h@xmath47-defined voids are characterised by the same best fit @xmath104kms@xmath3hmpc@xmath3 than the galaxy - void data .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of using redshift - space positioning and found that the linear relation between @xmath105 and void radius steepens considerably @xmath106kms@xmath3hmpc@xmath3 , independently of the sample of voids used .",
    "finally , we also studied the possible differences in the velocity field in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the void walls . in order to do this",

    "different line types correspond to different void radii as indicated in the key , and we only show results for voids identified using galaxies in redshift - space since there is little variation when using haloes or real - space positions .",
    "as can be seen , the velocities aligned with the radial direction from the void centre are about @xmath109 lower than the velocities on the direction of the void walls , regardless of void size and distance to void centre , indicating that galaxies have a slight but systematic ( @xmath110 to @xmath111 level ) tendency to follow trajectories along the void surfaces .",
    "the inset in the upper panel shows the dependence of the velocity dispersions in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight as a function of the distance to the void centre normalised by the void radius .",
    "as can be seen , at @xmath112 , the curves corresponding to different void radii converge . on the other hand ,",
    "smaller voids show much higher velocity dispersions at @xmath113 when compared to larger voids .",
    "this is in agreement with the indication that small voids are embedded in higher density regions , which could be respondible for the high velocity dispersions in the small voids inner regions .",
    "the lower panel of this figure shows the ratio between the velocity dispersions in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the void walls , and as can be seen there is little dependence on the distance to the void centre and on the void radius , being consistent with a roughly constant @xmath114 .",

    "( 2004 ) , where the different observational biases present in peculiar velocity data are analysed , and the results are compared to the theoretical expectations presented here .",
    "we now focus our attention on the spatial statistics of galaxies , haloes and mass around voids .",
    "we use the 2-point cross correlation function between void centres , and galaxies , haloes or dark - matter particles to characterise the spatial clustering properties of the vicinities of voids . in the following subsections we study the 1-dimensional cross - correlation function in real- and redshift - space , and the cross - correlation function as a function of the coordinates perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight .      in this subsection",
    "we study the spatial correlations between the void centres and the objects surrounding them .",
    "we will compare once more the resulting statistics from considering voids in the distribution of galaxies , haloes and mass , using real- and redshift - space positions .",
    "we start by analysing our expectations for the outcome of a void - object cross - correlation function , which we compute using the following estimator , @xmath115 where @xmath116 corresponds to the number of center - object pairs , and @xmath117 is the number of center - random pairs which would be measured if the positions of objects were uniformly distributed in space . the latter is calculated using the mean density of objects in the numerical simulation box .",
    "what we expect to find at small separations is an anti - correlation , lower in amplitude than the maximum overdensity set for identifying voids , that is , @xmath118 . on the other hand , at sufficiently large separations , @xmath119 , we would expect to find departures from this value and to gradually tend towards a small but positive value for the correlation function , indicating a population of galaxies at the void walls .",
    "we also expect @xmath120 at sufficiently large separations from the void centres .",
    "figure [ fig : xis ] shows the cross - correlation functions between galaxy - defined voids and galaxies ( upper panel ) , and galaxy- , halo- and mass - defined voids with their respective counterparts , in real space ( lower panel ) . solid and dashed lines in the upper panel represent the results in real- and redshift - space respectively . concentrating on the results for galaxy - defined voids",
    ", it can be seen that we obtain the expected value @xmath118 at low separations for void radii @xmath121h@xmath3mpc in real- and redshift - space ( smaller voids may show this effect at lower separations than those analysed in this work ) , and also that at the void radius , @xmath122 ( open squares ) .",
    "this relation holds regardless of the tracer used to identify voids . the general effect produced by changing from real- to redshift - space data , where the voids are identified in redshift - space and the tracers",
    "are also in redshift - space , is that of lowering very slightly the maximum clustering amplitude .",
    "another important feature of the correlation functions shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : xis ] is that at separations , @xmath119 , @xmath11 increases rapidly in value reaching @xmath123 , but always lower than the galaxy auto - correlation function .",
    "it is also noticeable the fact that the correlation function around voids can be positive outside the void radius , particularly for the smaller voids , @xmath124h@xmath3mpc , which can be interpreted as small voids being embedded in extended , reasonably high density regions , in accordance with the results from the velocity field around small voids , which shows systematic infalls instead of outflows . note that this peak in @xmath11 is still quite low compared to the galaxy correlation function .    from the comparison between results for different void populations in the lower panel of figure [ fig : xis ] , we see that mass - defined voids show a higher cross - correlation function than haloes and galaxies at @xmath125",
    ". haloes , on the other hand , show the same correlation levels than galaxies at small separations from the void centres . at larger separations , @xmath126 , individual dark - matter particles",
    "are less clustered than galaxies .",
    "haloes show a range of clustering amplitudes which correlates with the halo mass .",
    "in particular , h@xmath47 show consistent correlation amplitudes than galaxies , and h@xmath48 show higher @xmath11s .",
    "it is interesting to note though , that independently of the object used to identify voids , the cross - correlation function shows a similar qualitative shape , starting off at a constant negative value at low separations , independent of void radius , and increasing at separations of the order of the void radii , approaching @xmath127 . note that this change from negative to @xmath128 is sharper for haloes and galaxies than for mass - defined voids .",
    "for instance , for @xmath129h@xmath3mpc , the galaxy - void - galaxy cross - correlation function values are as high as the galaxy @xmath11 .    given the clear correlation between the void - size and the distance at which the correlation amplitude departs from its constant negative value",

    "this fraction is considerably smaller than results obtained from redshift surveys by hoyle & vogeley ( 2002 ) , who find that about @xmath12 of the volume in the universe is in larger voids . in order to properly assess whether this disagreement is significant ,",
    "it must be taken into account that the volume fraction in voids is very sensitive to the abundance of large voids in the sample analysed .",
    "therefore , it would be necessary to analyse larger simulations than the one used in this work to be able to make a more reliable comparison .",
    "another factor that influences the volume fraction in voids is the density contrast used to identify voids ; a higher density contrast increases slightly the fraction of volume .",
    "in addition , the identification of voids in redshift space also produces this effect , bringing the results from our simulation even closer to observational estimates .",

    "we find that the study of voids selected from the distribution of galaxies can provide biased results which can not easily be reconciled with results from dark - matter haloes .",
    "for instance , the number density of voids as a function of radius for galaxy - defined voids is in agreement with that of h@xmath48-defined voids for large void radii , and with h@xmath47 voids at small radii .",

    "<S> we study statistical properties of voids in the distribution of mass , dark - matter haloes and galaxies ( @xmath0 ) in a @xmath1cdm numerical simulation populated with galaxies using a semi - analytic galaxy formation model(galform , cole et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the properties of voids selected from galform galaxies are compatible with those of voids identified from a population of haloes with mass @xmath2h@xmath3m@xmath4 , similar to the median halo mass , @xmath5h@xmath3m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the number density of galaxy- and halo - defined voids can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than mass - defined voids for large void radii , however , we observe that this difference is reduced to about half an order of magnitude when the positions are considered in redshift - space . as expected , there are outflow velocities which show their maximum at larger void - centric distances for larger voids . </S>",
    "<S> we find a linear relation for the maximum outflow velocity , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the void - centric distance where this maximum occurs , follows a suitable power law fit of the form , @xmath7 . at sufficiently large distances </S>",
    "<S> , we find mild infall motions onto the sub - dense regions . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy velocity field around galaxy - defined voids is consistent with the results of haloes with masses above the median , showing milder outflows than the mass around mass - defined voids . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a similar analysis in redshift space would make both outflows and infalls to appear with a lower amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the velocity dispersion of galaxies and haloes is larger in the direction parallel to the void walls by @xmath8 . given that voids are by definition sub - dense regions , the cross - correlation function between galaxy - defined voids and galaxies are close to @xmath9 out to separations comparable to the void size , and at larger separations the correlation function level increases approaching the values of the auto - correlation function of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation amplitude of mass - defined voids vs. mass has a more gentle behaviour remaining negative at larger distances . </S>",
    "<S> the cross- to auto - correlation function ratio as a function of the distance normalised to the void radius , shows a small scatter around a relation that depends only on the object used to define the voids ( galaxies or haloes for instance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion pattern observed in @xmath10 is that of an elongation along the line of sight which extends out to large separations . </S>",
    "<S> positive @xmath11 contours evidence finger - of - god motions at the void walls . </S>",
    "<S> elongations along the line of sight are roughly comparable between galaxy- , halo- and mass - defined voids </S>",
