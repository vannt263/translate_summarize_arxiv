    "systems of strongly interacting matter under the influence of intense magnetic fields are subject of current studies .",
    "they have direct application to the physics of neutron stars and the properties of the quark gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions . in the last case ,",
    "recent studies indicate that the magnetic field could be as strong @xmath9 g @xcite .",
    "some neutron stars , more specifically the so called magnetars , are believed to have large magnetic fields in the core , perhaps as large as @xmath10 g according to some authors @xcite .",
    "the cores of massive neutron stars have densities exceeding a few times the nuclear saturation density . under such conditions ,",
    "a deconfinement transition to quark matter is possible and a hybrid star or a strange quark star can be formed .",
    "the conversion of the star is expected to start with the nucleation of small quark matter drops @xcite which subsequently grow at the expenses of the gravitational energy extracted from the contraction of the object and/or through a strongly exothermic combustion process .",
    "quark matter droplets with a variety of geometrical forms can also arise within the mixed hadron - quark phase that is expected to form inside hybrid stars if global charge neutrality is allowed @xcite . also , the most external layers of a strange star may fragment into a charge - separated mixture , involving positively - charged strange droplets ( strangelets ) immersed in a negatively charged sea of electrons , forming a crystalline solid crust @xcite .",
    "surface tension is a key ingredient in the understanding of such droplets and the associated phenomenology @xcite . in the case of mixed phases",
    ", it is known that there is a critical value for the surface tension of the order of tens of mev / fm@xmath8 @xcite which determines two possible scenarios .",
    "if the surface tension is smaller than the critical value , a mixed phase is energetically favored ; if it is larger , the hadron - quark interface in hybrid stars must be a sharp discontinuity .",
    "surface tension is also an important aspect in the process of quark matter nucleation that leads to the formation of hybrid or strange quark stars because it determines the critical size and the nucleation time of the first quark matter droplets @xcite .",
    "even though the surface tension is crucial in the above mentioned phenomena , there is still a broad spectrum of values depending on the models considered for its description .",
    "early estimates pointed to values below 5 mev / fm@xmath8 @xcite , but larger values within 10 @xmath12 50 mev / fm@xmath8 were widely used in the literature , see e.g. @xcite . also , calculations within the linear sigma model with up and down quarks at zero or low temperature and finite quark chemical potential , including vacuum and medium fluctuations predict a surface tension of @xmath13 mev/ fm@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , much larger values have also been reported in the literature .",
    "estimates given in ref . @xcite",
    "give values in the range 50 @xmath12 150 mev / fm@xmath8 and values around @xmath14 300 mev / fm@xmath8 were suggested on the basis of dimensional analysis of the minimal interface between a color - flavor locked phase and nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "more recent works evaluated the surface tension of three - flavor quark matter within the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model including finite size effects within the multiple reflection expansion formalism and the effect of color superconductivity .",
    "these calculations also give large values , above 100 mev / fm@xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the surface tension of degenerate three - flavor quark matter in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions , assuming that the system is a mixture of free fermi gases composed by quarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and electrons immersed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we describe finite size effects within the multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) framework @xcite . the article is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we present the quark matter description under the influence of an external magnetic field and include finite size effects .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "iii we present our results and finally in sect .",
    "iv give a summary and our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a fermi gas immersed in a magnetic field @xmath15 pointing in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the transverse motion of particles with electric charge @xmath17 is quantized into landau levels ( ll ) with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an integer . assuming zero anomalous magnetic moment , the single particle momentum and energy are @xmath20 @xmath21 due to landau quantization , momentum integrals in the transverse plane must be replaced by sums over the discretized levels .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic integrals we must use @xmath22 where , for spin one - half particles , @xmath23 is related with @xmath24 by @xmath25 being @xmath26 the spin projection of the particle along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the fermi momentum for flavor @xmath27 is @xmath28 since @xmath29 must be positive , we obtain a constraint in the sum of landau levels , @xmath30    according with @xcite we can replace @xmath31 with @xmath32 for all the cases except for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath35      in the present work we consider the formation of finite size droplets of quark matter .",
    "the effect of finite size is included in the thermodynamic potential adopting the formalism of multiple reflection expansion ( mre ; see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in the mre framework ,",
    "the modified density of states of a finite droplet with an arbitrary shape is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the droplet s surface , @xmath38 its volume , and @xmath39 is the surface contribution to the new density of states .",
    "for matter immersed in a magnetic field @xmath15 pointing in the @xmath16 direction , the momentum @xmath40 in eqs . and is given by @xmath41 . the mre density of states is shown in fig .",

    "the mre density of states for massive quarks is reduced compared with the bulk one , and for a range of small momenta it may become negative ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the way of excluding this non physical negative density of states is to introduce an infrared cutoff @xmath45 in momentum space ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , we have to perform the following replacement @xmath46 for magnetized matter , we combine eqs . and and obtain : @xmath47 where @xmath45 is the cutoff in the momentum along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "in order to obtain the value of @xmath45 , we have to solve the equation @xmath48 with respect to the momentum @xmath49 and take the larger root as the infrared cut - off . taking only the first two terms of eq .",

    "@xcite , the pressure of degenerate particles parallel to the magnetic field lines is @xmath60 with @xmath61 . including finite size effects in the expression above ,",
    "we can write the parallel thermodynamic potential of a magnetized quark matter drop within the mre formalism as : @xmath62 the latter expression can be written in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the parallel pressure within the mre formalism and @xmath65 is the parallel surface tension , i.e. , @xmath66 in these expressions @xmath67 is given by eq . and",
    "the momentum @xmath40 by eq . .",
    "to obtain the total parallel surface tension , we have to add the contribution of all particle species , e.g. quarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and electrons .               for obtaining the transverse surface tension contribution per flavor ,",

    "chemical equilibrium is maintained by weak interactions among quarks , e.g. @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , from which we obtain the following relations between the chemical potentials : @xmath79 here we consider cold deleptonized matter ; i.e. neutrinos leave freely the system .",
    "the charge neutrality condition reads @xmath80 the number densities in the latter equation , can be obtained starting from @xcite @xmath81 and including the mre density of states .",

    "in this section we calculate the surface tensions @xmath83 and @xmath74 , as functions of the baryon number density @xmath84 for different magnetic field intensities and different values of @xmath44 . in the case of a spherical drop",
    "we would have @xmath85 .",
    "however , in the presence of a strong magnetic field we expect the drop to be prolate , i.e. with a radius in the direction parallel to the magnetic field larger than the radius in the direction transverse to the magnetic field",
    ". the exact form of the drop as a function of the magnetic field will be explored in a future work . for the moment",
    ", we notice that @xmath86 and @xmath74 do nt depend on the exact geometry of the drop but only on the ratio @xmath44 , which is taken here as a free parameter .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath12[fig4 ] we show the contribution of quarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and electrons to the surface tension in the parallel and transverse directions for drops with @xmath44 = 10 fm , 100 fm and for the bulk limit with @xmath87 .",
    "the largest contribution comes from the strange quark which may have a surface tension in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 directions as large as @xmath90 for baryon number densities and magnetic field intensities typical of neutron star s interiors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of quarks @xmath0 and @xmath1 is much smaller , with values that never exceed @xmath91 ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) and that of electrons is negligible in quark matter , with values below @xmath92 ( see fig .",

    "the surface tension is an increasing function of @xmath93 .",
    "for ultra high values of the magnetic field ( e.g. @xmath94 gev@xmath8 ) the curves clearly show de hass@xmath12van alphen oscillations related to the filling of new landau levels . for lower fields ,",
    "such oscillations are also apparent for the lightest particles ( see e.g. panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and inset plot in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    for fixed @xmath93 and @xmath44 , the surface tensions in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 directions are almost unaffected by the magnetic field if @xmath6 is below @xmath7 gev@xmath8 ;",
    "as a consequence we have @xmath95 below such @xmath6 . for higher values of @xmath6 , e.g. @xmath94 gev@xmath8 , there is a significant increase in @xmath86 and a significant decrease in @xmath74 with respect to the unmagnetized case , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath12[fig4 ] .    finally , for fixed @xmath6 and @xmath93 , the effect of varying @xmath44 is negligible for heavier particles , like strange quarks ( see fig .",

    "however , for light quarks ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) the parallel surface tension is significantly decreased with respect to the bulk case , but this happens only for @xmath94 gev@xmath8 ( see panel ( b ) of fig .",

    "the transverse surface tension is almost unaffected by @xmath44 for any value of @xmath96 . in the case of electrons ,",
    "the effect of @xmath44 is even larger , because they are lighter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the total surface tension in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 directions : @xmath97    since , in practice , the surface tension of quark matter in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions is largely dominated by strange quarks , the results in fig .",

    "in this work we have studied the surface tension of magnetized quark matter within the formalism of multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) .",
    "quark matter is described as a mixture of free fermi gases composed by quarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and electrons , in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions . due to the presence of strong magnetic fields",
    "the transverse motion of these particles is quantized into landau levels , and as a consequence , the surface tension has a different value in the parallel and transverse directions with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "we have calculated the surface tension in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 directions for quark matter drops with different sizes . due to the magnetic field effect ,",
    "such drops are expected to be prolate .",
    "however , @xmath86 and @xmath74 depend on the shape of the drop only through the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "such behavior arises because the mre density of states is smoothed to eliminate its fluctuating part @xcite , and more specific details on the shape are washed out . in the present work , @xmath44",
    "is taken as a free parameter with values 10 fm , 100 fm and @xmath98 .    the largest contribution to",
    "the surface tension comes from strange quarks which have a surface tension an order of magnitude larger than the one for @xmath0 or @xmath1 quarks and more than two orders of magnitude larger than for electrons .",
    "our results show that the effect of varying @xmath44 is negligible for the strange quark .",
    "therefore , although @xmath44 has a significant effect on the surface tension of light particles , the total surface tension given in eqs .",
    "( [ total1])@xmath12([total2 ] ) is insensitive to @xmath44 and depends mostly on the magnetic field and the baryon number density .",
    "we also find that the surface tensions in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 directions are almost unaffected by the magnetic field if @xmath6 is below @xmath7 gev@xmath99 , being @xmath100 the mass of the pion .",
    "nevertheless , for higher values of @xmath6 , there is a significant increase in the parallel surface tension and a significant decrease in the transverse one with respect to the unmagnetized case ( see in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "in a recent work , garcia and pinto @xcite considered magnetized two flavor quark matter within the nambu - jona - lasinio model , and used a geometric approach for evaluating the surface tension . for unmagnetized matter",
    ", they find a surface tension @xmath101 mev @xmath102 , which is significantly larger than the values found here for @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks .",
    "however , this is not surprising since calculations of the surface tension using the mre formalism within the njl model also give very large values @xcite ; i.e. it is already known that the mit bag model tends to give in general a significantly smaller surface tension than the njl model . for magnetized matter , the results in ref",
    "@xcite show that the surface tension oscillates slightly around the @xmath103 value , for @xmath104 .",
    "however , for @xmath105 it decreases reaching a minimum value at @xmath106 which is about @xmath107 smaller than the @xmath103 result . for larger magnetic fields ,",
    "the surface tension increases continuously , reaching a value of @xmath108 mev @xmath102 for @xmath109 .",
    "there are some significant differences between the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and ours .",
    "first , we derive two surface tensions , one parallel and another transverse to the magnetic field , and they have a qualitative different dependence on @xmath96 : the parallel surface tension increases with @xmath96 and the transverse one decreases .",
    "secondly , our results are more sensitive to an increase of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , for @xmath110 gev@xmath8 @xmath111 , ref .",
    "@xcite finds a variation of a few percent in the surface tension with respect to the @xmath112 case . in our calculations ,",
    "the difference with respect to the unmagnetized case is in the range @xmath113 for typical compact star densities .",
    "another issue that needs some discussion is the effect of the coulomb interactions .",
    "notice that we are enforcing local charge neutrality in eq .",
    "( [ charge_neutrality ] ) .",
    "such approximation is valid for drops that are large compared with the debye screening length @xmath114 .",
    "however , for drops whose size is of the order or smaller than @xmath114 , electric fields may have a significant effect and global charge neutrality should be taken into account properly . since the debye screening length in quark matter is typically of the order of 5 fm @xcite , we expect that our results are reliable for the cases with @xmath115 fm",
    ". however , the case with @xmath116 fm ( which would correspond to a radius @xmath117 fm if the drop were spherical ) requires a more sophisticated analysis including the coulomb potential and solving consistently the poisson equation together with the other equations .",
    "such analysis is beyond the scope of the present work , but , in spite of the problem being highly non - linear , some approximate conclusions can be foreseen in the light of previous works @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coulomb interaction effect is consistently taken into account in the hadron - quark mixed phase , which consists of an equilibrium configuration of quark drops embedded in a hadronic medium .",
    "it is found that there is a rearrangement of the charged particles near the drop boundary : the negatively charged particles in the quark phase ( quarks @xmath1 , @xmath2 and electrons ) are attracted toward the boundary and the positively charged particles ( quarks @xmath0 ) are repelled from the boundary @xcite .",
    "such effect may affect the surface tension indirectly because it induces a change in the particle abundances .",
    "since the surface tension is largely dominated by the contribution of the strange quark , an increase in the @xmath2 quark number density near the boundary could lead to a surface tension that is somewhat larger that the here - found values . however , such effect is expected to be small , because the net charge in the quark drop is shown to be small due to screening effects @xcite .",
    "our results may have interesting consequences for neutron star interiors .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , beyond a limiting value of @xmath118 mev / fm@xmath8 the structure of the mixed quark - hadron phase that may form inside a neutron star becomes mechanically unstable and local charge neutrality is recovered , leading to a sharp interface .",
    "our results show that although the magnetic field can change significantly the surface tension of quark matter , its effect would nt be large enough as to change the nature of the interface from mixed to sharp .",
    "however , since quark matter drops adopt a prolate shape inside a strong magnetic field , we may expect significant changes in the geometrical structure of the drops , rods , slabs and all the `` pasta '' phase configurations that have been conjectured to exist if global charge neutrality is allowed .",
    "another relevant consequence is related to the triggering of the conversion of a hadronic star into a quark star ( hybrid or strange ) .",
    "the conversion is expected to begin with the nucleation of tiny quark matter drops at the core of the hadronic star which thereafter may grow to a macroscopic size and initiate a combustion front @xcite . since strong magnetic fields modify the surface tension , we may expect changes in the critical spectrum of fluctuations @xcite , in the nucleation rate , and probably , asymmetric combustion fronts .",
    "these effects will be explored in future work ."
