    "polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) in optical fibers limits fiber performance when designing optical channels with high bit rate @xcite .",
    "physically , the origin of pmd is optical birefringence caused by the asymmetry of the fiber due to factors such as external mechanical stress and temperature fluctuations , resulting in different group velocities for two orthogonal polarization modes .",
    "in addition , stochastic optical birefringence inside a single mode fiber leads to the random coupling of the two polarization modes , thus causing effects such as pulse widening @xcite , and the fluctuations of arrival times of pulses grow with the square root of the propagation distance @xcite . existing major applications of quantum communication , including quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite , rely on quantum entanglement between photons as a crucial element .",
    "therefore strategies to cope with decoherence have been investigated recently , for example , protection schemes based on decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) have been proposed @xcite . typically , a decoherence free two - photon state involves polarization singlet states with both photons having the same frequency @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that for photons with different frequencies , decoherence by pmd can not be avoided due to the breaking of symmetry of the collective states @xcite .",
    "entangled photon pairs produced by spontaneous down - conversion can be hyperentangled @xcite , i.e. entangled in various degrees of freedom ( dofs ) of the photons .",
    "for example , polarization @xcite , frequency @xcite , angular momentum @xcite , and energy time @xcite are variables that can be exploited .",
    "it is thus important to address how quantitatively hyperentangled photons disentangle for each dof , by investigating the decoherence of each dof separately . in this paper",
    ", we focus on polarization and frequency hyperentangled photons and explore how the entanglement of these two dofs may affect each other inside optical fibers with stochastic pmd .    the main purpose of this paper is to determine disentanglement length scales associated with frequency and polarization variables due to pmd decoherence , and to quantify the residual entanglement as photons propagate . to this end",
    "we will investigate three situations of photon propagation as depicted in fig .",
    "first we examine the propagation of single photon states , then hyperentangled two - photon states , in both polarization and frequency dofs .",
    "in one case we consider each photon passes through separate fibers , and in another case both photons pass through the same fiber , all of length @xmath0 .",
    "for each of these cases , we approach the problem by employing the master equation technique @xcite , which is based on an analogy between evolution of a state experiencing pmd along propagation direction , and that of spin - half particles in a stochastic magnetic field . by taking into consideration the frequency - dependent coupling strengths of the photon states with fiber birefringence",
    ", we analytically solve for the output density matrices .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . after providing the basic equations of our pmd model and quantum states of photons in sec .",
    "ii and iii , we investigate the propagation of a single - photon wave packet in sec .",
    "iv . by obtaining the single - photon s purity functions for each dof",
    ", we characterize the loss of purity of each dof of the photon as it propagates .",
    "the results importantly provide the characteristic decoherence lengths for individual photons .",
    "in particular , we obtain the pulse width at the output , which defines the minimum separation of well - resolved input pulses . in section",
    "v and vi , we investigate the dynamics of frequency and polarization disentanglement corresponding to the two - photon cases shown in fig .",
    "1b and 1c .",
    "our analysis is based on peres and horodecki s powerful criterion of entanglement , known as the ppt ( positive partial transposition ) criterion @xcite , and quantum entanglement is quantified by the negativity of partially transposed density matrix @xcite . for separate fiber propagation ( sec .",
    "v ) , we show that frequency disentanglement is independent of the initial polarization status . in addition , finite length disentanglement is possible for both dofs , each having distinct characteristic length scales . in section",
    "vi , we address the disentanglement process in common fiber propagation , and particularly , we examine a polarization entangled two - photon state in the singlet form with gaussian distribution of frequencies .",
    "the results provide insights about the disentanglement processes for states near dfs .",

    "in this way , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the stochastic nature of our pmd model originates from the randomness of @xmath16 . in this paper",
    "we adopt the assumption from @xcite , that the randomness is due to the fluctuations of optical axis along the fiber .",
    "in addition , the frequency dependence of @xmath16 is determined by fiber material properties only and therefore should not change over different positions . in this way it is plausible to assume @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is stochastic , and",
    "the @xmath38 is a deterministic function defined by the material and it can be expressed in terms of a taylor series about the peak frequency @xmath39 of input pulses : @xmath40 note that in non - dispersive media , only the first term remains and most of our discussions below will be based on such an approximation . to specify the statistics of @xmath37 , we assume that @xmath41 is a random process with zero mean , and it has the two - point correlation function @xcite : @xmath42 here the bar refers to the ensemble average , and @xmath43 characterizes the average strength of birefringence .",
    "we remark that the assumption of delta correlation function ( [ eq : biref_gaussian ] ) is not a strict requirement .",
    "as long as the correlation length of @xmath41 is sufficiently short , in the sense that @xmath44 does not change significantly within the correlation length , then it is justified to employ the markovian approximation in obtaining the master equation in later sections .",
    "let us first examine a deterministic situation corresponding to a given realization of @xmath16 . in the previous section , we have seen that if an incoming wave of frequency @xmath4 incident from the left with the polarization state @xmath45 , then according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : onephoton_trans ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : onephoton ] ) , there is an outgoing wave propagating to the right with the polarization state @xmath46 . since the system ( or the wave equation ) is linear , an incoming single - photon follows the same transformation rule to become an outgoing photon .",

    "we remark that input states with non - factorizable @xmath68 correspond to frequency entangled states , and similarly , non - separable @xmath72 means polarization entanglement .",
