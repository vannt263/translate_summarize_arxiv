    "ventricular fibrillation ( vf)a cardiac arrhythmia that is almost always fatal  is characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics that are thought to be chaotic  @xcite . in particular , a phenomenon known as cardiac alternans , which is characterized by beat - to - beat alternations ( i.e. , period 2 dynamics ) in both electrical and chemical behavior  @xcite , has been linked to vf and the onset of chaotic behavior such as spiral wave re - entry by experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies .",
    "the link between alternans and vf has been strengthened by the observation that alternans can form discordantly  @xcite , meaning that different regions of tissue alternate out - of - phase .",
    "spatially discordant alternans are particularly dangerous due to their tendency to promote conduction block of activity near the nodal lines that separate out - of - phase regions  @xcite .    in isolation",
    ", the onset of alternans in a single cardiac cell corresponds to a period - doubling bifurcation in the beat - to - beat voltage and calcium dynamics , usually measured by the action potential duration ( apd ) and peak calcium concentration ( ca )  @xcite .",
    "importantly , this period - doubling bifurcation can be driven by an instability in either the voltage or calcium dynamics  @xcite . when realized in a cable or patch of tissue ,",
    "the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium - driven alternans differ qualitatively from those of voltage - driven alternans  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when alternans are calcium - driven , the length scale of phase reversals between discordant regions potentially becomes as small as the length scale of a single cell  @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a reduced model for the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium - driven alternans  @xcite ( henceforth referred to as the _ sca model _ for spatiotemporal calcium alternans model ) , which reproduces these findings and shows that , for sufficiently large degrees of instability , calcium - driven alternans admit spatially discontinuous solutions  a class of solutions that is non  physical when alternans are voltage - driven .    in this paper we show that for a wide range of parameters , the sca model admits even more complex solutions .",
    "in particular , solutions can display multiple periodicities of different order and chaos  often simultaneously . for several decades , complex periodic and chaotic dynamics in cardiac tissue has been an important area of research due to its link with vf .",
    "such dynamics have been observed in both experimental  @xcite and numerical  @xcite studies .",
    "chaos has been observed in the echebarria  karma model  @xcite ( an analogous reduced model for voltage - driven alternans ) arising from the modulation of traveling wave patterns  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we observe in the sca model qualitatively different dynamics that are spatially localized .",
    "such solutions can be observed in detailed ionic models such as the shiferaw - fox model  @xcite that was used in ref .",
    "@xcite as we demonstrate below .",
    "similar patterns consisting of bands of chaotic and regular dynamics , known as the _ frozen random pattern_@xcite , were observed originally by kaneko@xcite in lattices of coupled chaotic maps .",
    "recently there has been much renewed interest in similar types of dynamics known as _ chimera states _ in the context of coupled phase oscillators@xcite and more general dynamical systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how such patterns appear in a model of spatiotemporal alternans dynamics , an example of a continuum coupled map  @xcite .",

    "the dynamics of the sca model for relatively low values of @xmath13 was studied in refs .  @xcite . as @xmath13",

    "the no alternans solution , stable for sufficiently small @xmath13 , is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the first bifurcation , corresponding to the onset of alternans , separates the no alternans solutions from the smooth wave pattern solutions .",
    "smooth wave pattern solutions can be either stationary or have a finite velocity , depending on whether the asymmetry of the green s function [ controlled by the parameter @xmath27 in ( [ eq : kernel ] ) ] is large or small , respectively . in the case of small or no asymmetry , as we consider here , smooth wave patterns have a finite velocity with which they move towards the pacing site . finally , at a second bifurcation the smooth wave patterns give way to solutions where the calcium profiles form discontinuous jumps at each phase reversal while the voltage profiles remain smooth .",
    "furthermore , these solutions are always stationary . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will see that the sca model admits even more complex dynamics .",
    "we will now study the dynamics of the sca model for even larger values of the calcium - instability parameter @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we find a wide parameter range that admits simultaneous multi - periodic and chaotic behavior that is spatially localized .",
    "we will study these dynamics over a large range of @xmath13 values while keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "in particular , throughout this paper we use @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and consider a cable of length @xmath33 .",

    "we emphasize here that dynamics similar to those we will present can be observed for other choices of parameters and initial conditions . finally , to update eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mapc ] ) and ( [ eq : mapa ] ) , we evaluate each integral by discretizing the interval @xmath40 $ ] using @xmath41 and using the trapezoidal rule .",

    "thus , the plots show an approximation to an attractor for each value of @xmath5 . for purposes of visualization",
    "we mark the locations of the phase reversals at @xmath38 and @xmath39 with dashed vertical lines .",
    "these profiles serve as good examples for the increasingly complex behavior we observe for larger @xmath13 values .",
    "+    for @xmath45 the steady - state dynamics are period - two and fall into the category of solutions studied in refs .",
    "next , at @xmath51 we see that a section of @xmath6 away from the phase reversals has undergone a bifurcation .",
    "we note , however , that the dynamics in these regions are not period - four , but represent two separate branches of period - two dynamics that are each realized by roughly half the points along the cable due to the random initial conditions .",
    "this interesting effect can be explained using the local calcium map in eq .",
    "( [ eq : localc ] ) and will be discussed below .",
    "we note that other branchings that we observe are in fact the result of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "in particular , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 we observe solutions with high - order periodicities away from the phase reversals but which remain period - two near the phase reversals .",
    "finally , for @xmath54 and @xmath55 we observe chaotic behavior . at @xmath54",
    "the chaos is localized to relatively small parts of the cable away from the phase reversals , with multi - periodic behavior elsewhere .",
    "finally , chaos dominates for @xmath55 , with only small areas of periodic behavior present near the phase reversals .",
    "in addition to different types of dynamics coexisting in different regions , different attractors can coexist in the same region .",
    "more specifically , we find that in some regions of the cable there can be multiple attractors which @xmath6 can approach as @xmath56 depending on the initial conditions .",
    "one example is in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] ( b ) in the region @xmath57 . in this region",
    "there are two period - two orbits , so that , for a fixed value of @xmath5 , @xmath6 alternates only between two values .",

    "therefore the plot seems to show four curves even though each point alternates at most between two values .",
    "another example occurs in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] ( e ) for @xmath58 where a chaotic attractor coexists with another which , although apparently periodic , is upon close inspection ( not shown ) also chaotic .      to gain some insight into the dynamics we have observed ,",

    "( [ eq : localc ] ) maps the interval @xmath60 $ ] into itself .",
    "a straightforward analysis shows that for @xmath61 the fixed - point solution @xmath62 is stable and loses stability at @xmath63 . immediately above @xmath64 ,",
    "the period - two solution @xmath65 is stable , but then loses stability at @xmath66 .",
    "interestingly , instead of a single period - four solution , two stable period - two solutions are born whose basins of stability partition the interval @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "this bistability is due to the presence of two extremal points in the cubic map and is similar to the dynamics found in other one - dimensional maps  @xcite . while bistability between periodic and chaotic dynamics is observed in these other maps , the symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ eq : localc ] ) implies that both stable solutions are either both periodic or both chaotic .",
    "these solutions , which are given by @xmath67 , are themselves stable until @xmath68 , when two period - four solutions are born . as with many other one - dimensional maps ,",
    "this process of period - doubling branchings continue as a cascade until the onset of chaotic behavior  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] we illustrate the dynamics of the local map with its bifurcation diagram .",
    "we highlight the splitting of stable periodic solutions at @xmath66 by plotting one family in blue and the other in red .",
    "note , however , that solutions are symmetric about @xmath62 .",
    "we also compute for each @xmath13 value the lyapunov exponent defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is formally an infinitesimal perturbation to a solution in the attractor and @xmath71 is the evolved perturbation after @xmath4 iterations , such that @xmath72 describes the rate of divergence ( or convergence ) of two nearby trajectories . in fig .",

    "if , on the other hand , @xmath5 and @xmath110 are chosen on opposite sides of a node ( e.g. , @xmath87 and @xmath111 ) , then the joint distribution flips such that its support lies solely in the second and fourth quadrants , with @xmath108 whenever @xmath112 ( not shown ) .",
    "this strong structural effect present in the joint distribution implies that the occupation probabilities at different points along the cable are correlated [ i.e. , the joint distribution can not be separated into the product of the two marginal distributions , @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "we now investigate whether any further correlations exist past the shared / opposite sign structure that is due to the switching inherent in the system . to this end",

    "we compute the marginal and joint distributions at the same points along the cable . we observe ( not shown ) that the two distributions are very similar , with the main difference being that @xmath116 is coarser ; an effect that is simply due to sampling the joint distribution . to confirm this",

    "the parameter @xmath149 is a length scale that describes the width of @xmath150 , and physically indicates the length scale of electrotonic coupling , i.e. , the spatial coupling that is due to the diffusion of voltage across tissue .",
