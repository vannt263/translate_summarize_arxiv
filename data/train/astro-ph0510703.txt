    "the radio - quiet quasar , 14  ( @xmath2 ) , is best known for constant display of enigmatic behaviour .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ; mcdowell 1995 ) revealed that 14exhibited a normal non - variable , radio - quiet continuum , but weak and blueshifted high - ionisation emission lines .",
    "in contrast , the uv and optical  appeared rather strong .",
    "a hand - full of weak - line quasars have since been discovered ( e.g. leighly 2004 ; hall 2004 ; reimers 2005 ) , but no general consensus has been reached as to the nature of the physical mechanisms involved .    a relativistically beamed continuum , as in a blazar ,",
    "could explain the absence of emission lines . for 14  this explanation",
    "is normally dismissed as the sed of the quasar is strikingly similar to that of radio - quiet agn ( elvis 1994 ) . moreover ,",
    "14  is relatively radio weak with an optical - to - radio flux ratio of @xmath3 ( kellermann 1989 ) and , by definition , consistent with radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , a multi - year radio observing campaign of 14  with the vlba revealed strong evidence of a radio jet with a highly relativistic speed ( dopper factor @xmath4 ) and likely viewed within a few degrees of pole - on ( blundell 2003 ) .",
    "blundell suggested that the pole - on orientation could explain some of the optical / uv properties , assuming that the line - of - sight was into the broad line region , thus the emission line spectrum is diluted by the accretion disc continuum .",
    "although 14  is individually curious , a better understanding of it could have broader implications .",
    "the debate whether the radio characteristics of agn show a bimodal or continuous distribution is ongoing ( e.g. goldschmidt 1999 ; white 2000 ; ivezic 2002 ; cirasuolo 2003 ) .",
    "the discovery of objects which possess characteristics of both groups are obviously of interest .",
    "it is clear that all agn are capable of producing radio emission , hence able to generate jets on some level .",
    "observational support for this comes from sensitive , high - resolution radio imaging of radio - quiet agn , evidencing jets in some objects ( e.g. blundell & beasley 1998 ; ulvestad 2005 ) .",
    "the simplest conclusion is that the radio mechanism in radio - quiet and radio - loud agn are identical , except that the bulk kinetic power is smaller in radio - quiet objects .    to some extent",
    ", these observations form the bases of the ` aborted jet ' model which has become fashionable in agn circles .",
    "the idea being that short or aborted jets are produced in radio - quiet agn and the high - energy jet particles , which are expelled close to the black hole environment , illuminate the accretion disc ( e.g. henri & petrucci 1997 ; ghisellini 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of these energetic particles can account , in whole or in part , for the high - energy continuum traditionally associated with the accretion disc corona .",
    "14  could evolve to be an important laboratory in investigation of the radio - quiet / loud dichotomy ( or lack of it ) , because the quasar clearly possesses characteristics of both classes : it is an example of a radio - quiet agn which has successfully launched a relativistic radio jet to large distances . in this paper",
    ", we examine the x - ray properties of this quasar to study the behaviour of possible jet emission closer to the central engine .",
    "14  was observed with  ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) on 2001 january 23 ( revolution 206 ) and 2001 december 22 ( revolution 373 ) for approximately 71 and 42 , respectively . at both epochs ,",
    "all on - board instruments functioned normally .",
    "the epic pn ( strder et al . 2001 ) and mos ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner 2001 ) cameras were operated in full - frame mode with the thin filter in place .",
    "the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs1 and rgs2 ; den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) also collected data during this time , as did the optical monitor ( om ; mason et al .",
    "the rgs data were presented in an examination of line - of - sight absorption toward 14  ( fang 2005 ) , and will not be discussed here .",
    "the observation data files ( odfs ) were processed to produce calibrated event lists using the  science analysis system ( xmm - sas v6.4.0 ) and the most recent calibration files . due to anomalies in the mission - elapsed - time during the first observation , the default values of the the environment variable sas_obt_met_fit were changed accordingly to `` 0,1,0.5,0.9,1 '' . otherwise , standard processing practices were followed .",
    "unwanted hot , dead , or flickering pixels were removed as were events due to electronic noise .",
    "event energies were corrected for charge - transfer losses , and time - dependent epic response matrices were generated using the sas tasks arfgen and rmfgen .",
    "light curves were extracted from these event lists to search for periods of high background flaring .",
    "some flaring was evident during revolution 206 , consequently the data during these intervals were simply ignored .",
    "the source plus background photons were extracted from a circular region with a radius of 35@xmath5 , and the background was selected from an off - source region with a radius of 50@xmath5 and appropriately scaled to the source region .",
    "single and double events were selected for the pn spectra , and single - quadruple events were selected for the mos .",
    "pile - up was examined at both epochs and deemed negligible in all instruments .",
    "the om worked in imaging mode at both epochs . in total , eight images were taken during revolution 206 , and ten during revolution 373 . only the @xmath6 filter ( @xmath7 ) was used with typical exposures between @xmath8 .",
    "a log of the  observations is provided in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    ".log of  observations of 14 .",
    "the  revolution number of when the observation was conducted is given in column ( 1 ) and the observation i d in column ( 2 ) .",
    "the instrument is shown in column ( 3 ) .",
    "the total amount of useful exposure ( gti ) is reported in column ( 4 ) , and the estimated number of source counts is reported in column ( 5 ) .",
    "the combined exposure for all images is given for the om .",
    "the energy bands considered are @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the pn and mos , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a power law ( @xmath11 ) provided an acceptable fit ( @xmath12 to the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 rest frame ) epic spectra of 14 during revolution 373 .",
    "as with the earlier observation , no narrow iron emission line was detected .    extrapolating the high - energy power law to lower energies was a good approximation to the broadband spectra .",
    "indeed , fitting the single power law over this entire band did not result in a significant change of the photon index ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the addition of a second continuum component did improve the fit over the single power law ( f - test probability of @xmath16 ) , but not as significantly as in the revolution 206 data .    adopting the broken power law fit , resulted in an unabsorbed @xmath10 flux of about @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding rest frame luminosities in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 range were @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the timing behaviour of 14  during revolution 373 was much more in - line with the expected behaviour of a high - luminosity quasar .",
    "the @xmath22 light curve ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) was completely consistent with a constant over the @xmath23 observations ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "similarly , the uv light curve was also constant .",
    "the x - ray spectral variability was also negligible .",
    "the fractional variability in the two x - ray sub - bands ( i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) was on the @xmath27 level , and the hardness ratio was also rather constant over time ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 flux density of 14  diminished from @xmath29 during revolution 206 to @xmath30 during revolution 373 .",
    "the fractional decrease in the agn uv flux density was about @xmath31 over the eleven month period .",
    "over the same time , the average broadband x - ray flux diminished by @xmath32 .    a serendipitous , optically bright object ( @xmath33 ) was identified in the om field - of - view in two images at each epoch .",
    "the object is possibly associated with the f8 star hd  124732 , but this is not conclusive given the several arc minute discrepancy in positions .",
    "of importance was that the flux of the object ( @xmath34 ) was equal at both epochs ( revolution 206 and 373 ) to within about @xmath35 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the different uv fluxes measured in 14arise from changes in the agn and not from instrumental effects of the om .",
    "the optical - to - x - ray spectral index , @xmath1 , is the slope of a hypothetical power law extending between the optical ( uv ) and x - ray continuum in agn : @xmath36 in the standard definition @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the intrinsic flux densities at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , consequently @xmath41    typical values of @xmath42 for unabsorbed , radio - quiet agn are between @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the slope steepening with increasing uv luminosity ( e.g. strateva 2005 ) . in radio - quiet agn , @xmath42 is likely representative of accretion disc processes , and understanding the origin and distribution of @xmath42 characteristics will lead to a bettering understanding of the primary emission mechanism in agn .    with the data at hand , we were able to measure the spectral index of the power law between @xmath39 and @xmath45 ( the rest frame peak emission observed in the @xmath6 filter ) : @xmath46 the spectral slope between @xmath45 and @xmath40 is then : @xmath47 from these equations we can determine a transformation from our measured @xmath1 and the standard definition , @xmath42 , specifically : @xmath48    this leaves us to estimate @xmath49 and thus requires that we make some assumptions .",
    "firstly , we assume that the uv @xmath50 properties of 14  are not unusual .",
    "while it is clear that the emission line properties are unique , mcdowell ( 1995 ) concluded that the continuum was rather typical of radio - quiet agn .",
    "as such , we adopt the spectral slope of the composite sdss quasar spectrum between @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , vanden berk 2001 ) .",
    "this brings us to the second assumption , that the slope between @xmath45 and @xmath53 is not drastically different .",
    "this is likely invalid ( e.g. laor 1995 ; shang 2005 ) , but since the systematic uncertainty will be introduced to both measurements , the differences between the two epochs should remain precise .    during the low - flux observation ( revolution 373 ) , we measured @xmath54 , which is not atypical of unabsorbed , radio - quiet agn ( e.g. strateva 2005 ; yuan 1998 ; elvis 1994 ) . interestingly , during the high - flux , revolution 206 observation , @xmath55 , very flat , even in terms of bl  lac spectral indices ( e.g. perlman 2005 ) .",
    "we recalculate @xmath42 during revolution 206 , but this time we considered only the @xmath39 emission from the hard power law component of the spectrum .",
    "this time , @xmath56 , much more comparable to the revolution 373 measurement . this may be implying that the high energy component originates from a less variable , accretion dominated process , whereas the steep , soft component may be beamed emission .",
    "considering its high luminosity and radio - quiet nature , the x - ray spectrum of 14  displayed impressive spectral changes over an eleven month period . in figure",
    "[ fig : xdiffs ] some of the x - ray spectral difference between the two observational epochs are portrayed . a ratio spectrum between the high - flux ( rev . 206 ) and low - flux ( rev .",
    "373 ) data illustrate how the flux difference between the two epochs is not uniform across the spectrum , but gradually increases toward lower energies .",
    "the difference spectrum ( high @xmath57 low ) also indicates complex spectral changes .",
    "a power law ( @xmath58 ) , corrected for galactic absorption , and fitted to the difference spectrum between the rest frame @xmath14 ( @xmath13 in the observed frame ) band gives a good result .",
    "this high - energy band was selected as it appears to show the least amount of spectral variability according to the analysis in sect .",
    "[ sect : jan ] and [ sect : dec ] . however , there are some deviations at the highest energies . on extrapolating the power law to lower energies",
    "significant deviations are seen ( figure  [ fig : xdiffs ] ) , indicating that there are changes in the spectral shape .",
    "this is supported by the different phenomenological fits found when fitting the two data sets separately ( see table  [ tab : fit206 ] and [ tab : fit373 ] ) .",
    "the residuals in the difference spectrum imply changes in the shape of ( at least ) one spectral component .",
    "the fact that the residuals form an excess at higher and lower energies may suggest that if the variations are due to one spectral component , this component is likely not smooth in nature ( like a power law ) , but may have some curvature ( as may be expected from jet emission ) .",
    "we further investigated the spectral variability by considering the correlation in the flux variations in the two energy bands used .",
    "taylor ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the flux - flux plot can be effectively used for this purpose .",
    "if the varying component of a spectrum has a constant shape ( i.e. variations are due to changes in normalisation only ) then the flux - flux relation will be linear .",
    "on the other hand , the relation will not be linear if the spectral shape also changes .",
    "we constructed a flux - flux plot ( figure  [ fig : ff ] ) as demonstrated by taylor ( 2003 ) . in considering the variable high - flux observation , both a linear and quadratic function fit the data equally well ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ) , although the quadratic fit does seem a better approximation to the data ( see the inset in figure  [ fig : ff ] ) .",
    "the possible non - linearity displayed in the flux - flux plot during revolution 206 implies that the short - term ( within the observation ) variations are not due to a simple change in normalisation of one component , but require a change in the spectral shape as well ( i.e. pivoting of the power law at high energies ; e.g. zdziarski 2002 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the flux - dependent spectral variability seen in figure  [ fig : hrcr ] and the spectral differences seen in the analyses of the high- and low - flux state spectra during revolution 206 ( see figure  [ fig:206hilo ] , table  [ tab:206hilo ] , and section  [ sect:206hilo ] )",
    ".    extrapolation of the linear and quadratic fits to lower count rates in the flux - flux plot showed that the quadratic fit also predicted the low - flux state of revolution 373 much better than the linear fit ( figure  [ fig : ff ] ) .",
    "as with the difference spectrum ( figure  [ fig : xdiffs ] ) , this further emphasises that the long - term variability , which is only examined at two epochs separated by eleven months , required changes in the shape of the variable component .",
    "the main results of this analysis are the following :    * in comparing x - ray data from two epochs , 14  appeared to exhibit two distinct states : a variable , high - flux state ( revolution 206 ) ; and a quiescent low - flux one ( revolution 373 ) . at both epochs ,",
    "a power law component with @xmath61 was required , while during the high - flux state an additional , steeper ( @xmath62 ) power law was also needed .",
    "significant spectral and flux variability was seen during the high - flux state , whereas during revolution 373 , the variability was negligible . *",
    "short - term variability ( within revolution 206 ) and long - term variability ( between the two epochs ) was consistent with spectral hardening with diminishing intensity . in comparing the hard ( @xmath26 ) and soft ( @xmath25 ) light curves during the high - flux state , there appeared to be a short lag such that the hard energy band followed the soft by about @xmath63 .",
    "* the radiative efficiency measurement during the bright , revolution 206 observations was @xmath64 .",
    "the value is consistent with emission from an environment around a kerr black hole or relativistic beaming . *",
    "though not statistically significant , there appeared to be some uv variability during the high state , which showed similar trends as the x - ray light curve . *",
    "the optical - to - x - ray spectral slope was estimated at both epochs from simultaneous uv data , and found to be significantly flatter during the brighter x - ray phase .",
    "uv variability between the two epochs was within about @xmath31 and typical for quasars , whereas the average broadband x - ray flux changed by about @xmath65 .",
    "the broken power law and blackbody plus power law models presented thus far are informative .",
    "for example , both models illustrated significant spectral variability between the two epochs , as well as on shorter time scales during revolution 206 , but they lack physical intuition .",
    "a sudden break in a power law , or a high and variable blackbody temperature , appears unphysical .    in this section",
    "we attempt to derive a physically motivated model for the spectral behaviour of 14 . in doing so , we demand that all the different spectra can be fitted by a physically consistent model .",
    "this means that we not only attempt to describe the spectra at both epochs with a consistent model , but also the high- and low - flux spectra during revolution 206 . consequently , the fits in this section include three rather than two data sets ( high - flux revolution 206 ; low - flux revolution 206 ; lowest flux revolution 373 ) . for simplicity , we use only the pn data in this section .    as opposed to a broken power law",
    ", a double power law does have physical foundation .",
    "initially we fit all three spectra with a double power law model .",
    "we required that the photon indices were constant in each spectrum and allowed only the normalisations to vary .",
    "this provided a good fit to the data ( @xmath66 ) and illustrated how the hard power law component dominated during the lowest flux state ( revolution 373 ) and the steeper component became more relevant with increasing flux .",
    "we continued to build on this by also fixing the normalisation of the hard power law to be constant in all three spectra .",
    "therefore , the only variable component at each epoch was the normalisation of the soft power law .",
    "this provided a slightly worse , but still acceptable fit ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the hard power law component ( @xmath68 ) was essentially established by the revolution 373 spectrum .",
    "the contribution of the steep power law ( @xmath69 ) component to the total spectrum during revolution 373 was negligible .",
    "however , as the flux increased , the contribution of soft component became more important .",
    "in the highest flux state ( high state during revolution 206 ) the steep component was attributed to @xmath70 of the unabsorbed , @xmath9 flux , diminishing slightly to @xmath71 in the low - flux spectrum of revolution 206 , and completely negligible ( @xmath72 ) at revolution 373 .",
    "it is interesting that this simple double power law model provides a reasonable fit to three different spectra .",
    "as seen throughout the paper , the soft component was more variable on short and long time scales .",
    "the fastest time scales at which we would expect to see variations associated with the accretion disc , would be on dynamical time scales ( @xmath73 ) . for 14 , with a black hole mass of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76",
    "this corresponds to variation on the order of @xmath77 in the observed frame .",
    "we are clearly seeing variations on much shorter time scales .",
    "emission from an accretion disc could be consistent with the harder power law component .",
    "the absence of clear signatures from the disc ( e.g. iron emission line , reflection component above @xmath78 , and variability ) is not so surprising given the high luminosity ( @xmath79 ) of 14  ( e.g. see reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , the harder power law in the double power law model can be successfully replaced with a thermal comptonisation ( titarchuk & mastichiadis 1994 ) component ( @xmath80 ) . in this case , the steep power law remained unchanged compared to the double power law fit .",
    "the seed photons have a temperature of @xmath81 and the plasma has a temperature of about @xmath82 . the situation is not inconsistent with predicted physical conditions , although the measured model parameters are not well constrained by the fit .",
    "it is conceivable that the soft , variable power law component can be attributed to emission from an inner jet .",
    "the slope of the x - ray spectrum ( @xmath62 ) is steeper than the radio spectrum ( e.g ulvestad 2005 ) , which argues against inverse compton scattering as the emitting process . the steep spectrum and remarkable variability strongly favour synchrotron radiation ( e.g. wilson & yang 2002 ) .",
    "the jet could be working intermittently : present and dominant during the high - flux revolution 206 observation , and absent during the later , low - flux observation . in the spectral fits presented in this section",
    ", we have demanded that the spectral slope remains constant at all epochs .",
    "this is , of course , not a necessary constraint as the x - ray slopes of jet emitting agn are know to vary dramatically on various time scales .",
    "in fact , based on spectral modelling , we do not rule out variations in the photon index of the jet component between epochs , but note that the lack of variability seen during the low - flux state , makes the argument pointless .",
    "it should also be noted that the jet emission process is probably better described by a curved spectrum in the  energy range ( perlman 2005 ) .",
    "variations in this curvature can be responsible for some of the spectral variation implied by the difference spectrum and the flux - flux plot analysis ( figure  [ fig : xdiffs ] and [ fig : ff ] , respectively ) .",
    "combined jet and accretion disc models have been fitted to a number of nearby , radio - loud , unbeamed objects ( e.g. cen  a , evans 2004 ; ngc  4261 , zezas 2005 ) , and have also been proposed to account for the apparently higher x - ray flux in beamed objects ( e.g. browne & murphy 1987 ; kembhavi 1993 ) . the fact that neither component in 14  appears to suffer from obscuration , favours the conception that 14  is beamed as well ( consistent with its radio jet ) .",
    "if the presumable lag detected between the two components ( figure  [ fig : ccf ] ) is attributed to light travel time delays , then the two components ( likely jet base and accretion disc corona ) are separated by only about @xmath83 .",
    "this essentially places the base of the jet inside the corona , giving credence to the idea that a jet could be replenishing the plasma reservoir with high - energy particles .",
    "the spectral and short - term timing behaviour do support the notion that 14  is being viewed pole - on ( blundell 2003 ) .",
    "this can , in principle , describe the weakness of the high - ionisation emission lines seen in the optical and uv if , as blundell describe , we are looking directly into the broad line region . on the other hand , the strong , low - ionisation  emission could be collisionally produced at large distances where the radio jet components are found ( @xmath84 from the core , blundell ) .",
    "the suggestion that the x - ray jet works intermittently also describes why the sed is consistent with an unbeamed continuum , assuming that the jet is more often off than on .",
    "this follows from the dramatic differences in @xmath1 , as measured from simultaneous x - ray and uv data , which indicate that the continuum can certainly be much flatter ( apparently beamed ) when the jet is on .",
    "in addition , if the x - rays are assumed to originate from the base of the jet and hence feeding the radio jet , the irregularity of the x - ray jet emission could help explain the weakness of the radio emission relative to the optical .",
    "we have presented two  observations , separated by eleven months , of the radio - quiet quasar 14 .",
    "the x - ray behaviour is consistent as arising from a combination of a relativistic jet and accretion disc processes .",
    "the spectral and timing variability strongly suggest that the jet works intermittently , which could help describe some of the complexities seen in the sed of the quasar .",
    "the variations found in @xmath1 , measured from contemporaneous x - ray and uv data , demand the need for simultaneous , multiwavelength observations to accurately define the sed of 14 .",
    "based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
