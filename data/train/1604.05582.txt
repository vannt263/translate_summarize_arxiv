    "the identification of individuals with influential positions in a network is of outmost importance for a number of problems in economics and beyond , as for instance regarding the diffusion of epidemics @xcite , the stability of systems of interconnected banks @xcite and the development of criminal networks @xcite .",
    "different contexts often lead to different measures of _ centrality _ that capture the level of the said influence more appropriately .",
    "degree centrality is found to be important in problems of adoption with word  of  mouth communication @xcite and biases in the perception of social norms @xcite .",
    "bonacich centrality @xcite is found to be crucial in problems related to criminal behavior @xcite , whereas eigenvector centrality is found to be important in diffusion processes @xcite .    in this article",
    "we focus on _ decay centrality_. this is a measure of centrality in which a node is rewarded for how close it is to other nodes , but in a way that very distant nodes are weighted less than closer ones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a decay parameter and @xmath2 is the geodesic distance between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ". for low values of @xmath5 decay centrality puts much more weight on closer nodes , thus becoming proportional to degree centrality , whereas for high values of @xmath5 it measures the size of the component a node lies in    it is considered to be richer than other distance related measures , because it captures the idea that the importance of a node for another is proportional to their distance ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "it has been considered important in problems of optimal targeting selection in networks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite find decay centrality to be the measure that helps selecting the node that can lead to the maximum diffusion of a given action in a social network .",
    "nevertheless , its use is cumbersome for two main reasons .",
    "first , except in very simple structures , the nodes with maximum decay centrality can not be easily identified , since the measure depends vastly on the exact network topology and the value of the decay parameter .",
    "second , calculating the decay centrality of all nodes and subsequently choosing the one that maximizes it might be computationally costly , since it requires calculating the geodesic distance between each pair of nodes and subsequently summing a function of them .",
    "nodes , the time complexity for calculating degree and closeness centrality are in @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where for the calculation of shortest paths that is necessary for closeness centrality is used the simple dijkstra algorithm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "once the shortest paths have been calculated , decay centrality requires the calculation of @xmath8 for each pair of nodes @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the time complexity of calculating decay centrality is in @xmath10 . ]",
    "the aim of this article is to show the close connection between decay centrality and two well  studied and computationally cheaper measures , namely degree and closeness centrality .",
    "the relations are established both analytically and numerically and suggest that the nodes with maximum decay centrality usually belong either to the set of nodes with maximum degree or to the set of nodes with maximum closeness .    in particular ,",
    "focusing on connected networks , we show that for sufficiently low values of the decay parameter the nodes that maximize decay centrality belong to the set of nodes with maximum degree , whereas for sufficiently high values of the decay parameter the nodes that maximize decay centrality maximize closeness as well .",
    "the first proposition is not surprising as it is already known that for low values of @xmath5 decay centrality is proportional to degree .",
    "however , the second proposition establishes a novel relationship between decay and closeness centrality for high values of @xmath5 , for which so far decay centrality was associated only with the size of the component a node lied in .",
    "furthermore , we provide two conditions that are sufficient to order a pair of nodes with respect to their decay centrality for all values of the decay parameter .",
    "the conditions depend , in an intuitive way , on the distances between the nodes under comparison and all other nodes in the network .",
    "finally , we provide a more general relation between decay centrality , degree and closeness that extends to intermediate values of the decay parameter . in particular ,",
    "we provide sufficient conditions for a node with higher degree than another node to also have higher decay centrality for all @xmath11 and similarly for a node with higher closeness to also have higher decay centrality for all @xmath12 .",
    "based on those theoretical findings , we attempt to obtain a better understanding on these relations for intermediate values of the decay parameter via numerical simulations . we find that in the vast majority of cases the nodes with maximum decay centrality belong either to the set of nodes with maximum degree or to the set of nodes with maximum closeness .",
    "when the two sets intersect a node that belongs to their intersection almost always maximizes decay centrality as well , whereas when the two sets do not intersect for low values of @xmath5 decay centrality is maximized by nodes with maximum degree and as @xmath5 increases there is a threshold above which decay centrality is maximized by nodes with maximum closeness .",
    "the threshold varies with the network parameters , however a rule of thumb with a threshold at @xmath13 is sufficient to ensure that the chosen node is ranked among the top nodes in terms of decay centrality , with high probability .",
    "the relation between different measures of centrality has attracted research interest over the years ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite found strong correlation among centrality measures that included degree and closeness , but not decay centrality , in a network of relations between ceos .",
    "similarly , @xcite found strong concordance in the ranking of individuals across different network centrality measures in a network of individuals who participated in activities with the risk of hiv transmission .",
    "finally , @xcite find similar results , although not as strong correlation coefficients as the previous studies , for a variety of networks corresponding to different process .",
    "all of these studies show particularly strong connection between degree and closeness , but do not consider decay centrality .",
    "more recently , and closer to the flavor of our analysis , @xcite provided an axiomatization of several centrality measures , including decay centrality , and showed that all of them can be described using the same set of axioms . given these axioms ,",
    "the measures differ only in that they consider different vectors of data that describe the position of nodes in the network .",
    "the authors also provide correlation coefficients between different measures in simulated networks and their results are in line with our findings .",
    "the simulations report results on correlation coefficients , similarly to the previously mentioned articles , whereas the emphasis of our analysis is put particularly on nodes that are highly ranked in different measures .",
    "to some extent our analysis is related to the problem of identifying networks for which different centrality measures generate the same ranking , which remains largely unexplored for non  tree networks . for degree and closeness",
    "centrality @xcite show that this is indeed the case for nested  split graphs .",
    "finally , there is a broad connection with the literature related to the axiomatization of centrality measures , although not decay centrality per se , and other related problems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consider a set of nodes @xmath14 , with cardinality @xmath15 , which are connected through a network .",
    "a network is represented by a family of sets @xmath16 , with @xmath17 denoting the set of nodes that are directly connected with @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath17 is called @xmath3 s neighborhood and has cardinality , @xmath18 .",
    "we focus on undirected networks , where @xmath19 if and only if @xmath20 . a path in a network between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a sequence @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the _ geodesic distance _ , @xmath2 , between two nodes is the length of the shortest path between them .",

    "is a function that maps from the set of nodes to the real numbers , i.e. @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the centrality of node @xmath3 in the network @xmath26 .    the _ degree centrality _ ( or simply _ degree _ ) maps from each node to the cardinality of its neighborhood , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "we also define the set of nodes with maximum degree , i.e. @xmath30 . similarly to this , denote by @xmath31 the number of nodes that have geodesic distance @xmath32 from node @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the superscript @xmath32 will often be omitted when referring to @xmath35 ( degree ) . also , for connected networks it holds by definition that @xmath36 .    the _ closeness centrality _ ( or simply _ closeness _ ) maps from each node to the inverse of the sum of the geodesic distances from each other agent in the network , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "notice that closeness centrality measures how easily a node can reach all other nodes in the network . according to this definition",
    ", we define the set of nodes with maximum closeness centrality , i.e. @xmath38 .    for some of the analytical results we focus on the inverse of closeness , which is known as _ farness _ and is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "this is essentially a measure of discentrality , as it measures how far a node is from all other nodes .",
    "obviously the order of nodes with respect to closeness is the reverse of that with respect to farness , hence central nodes are going to be considered those that minimize farness .",
    "finally , given a decay parameter @xmath40 , _ decay centrality _ is a measure that maps from each node to the sum of distances from each other node in the network , adjusted by a decay parameter that makes distant nodes count less than closer ones , i.e. @xmath41 . as in the previous two cases , for each value of @xmath5 , we define the set of nodes with maximum decay centrality , i.e. @xmath42 .    [ proplowdelta ] exists @xmath43 such that for all @xmath44 and @xmath45 , if @xmath46 then @xmath47 .",
    "the proposition states that for low values of the decay parameter a node with higher degree than another will necessarily have higher decay centrality as well .",

    "[ corlowdelta ] exists @xmath43 such that for all @xmath44 holds that @xmath48 .",
    "the reason why the two sets may not be identical is that two nodes with the same degree might have different decay centralities .",
    "when the degrees of two nodes are equal , differences arise from the factors corresponding to more distant nodes , which previously had a negligible effect . in fact , again for low values of @xmath5 , between two nodes with equal degrees , higher decay centrality has the node with higher number of nodes at distance equal to 2 , i.e. @xmath49 . if these quantities are also equal then we move to @xmath50 etc . in order to state this result",
    "formally we need an additional definition .    given two vectors of real numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 the first vector is larger than the second one according to the _ lexicographic order _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath53 , if @xmath54 for the first @xmath32 for which @xmath55 and @xmath56 differ .",
    "the two vectors are equal according to the lexicographic order , i.e. @xmath57 , if @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "it is apparent that two vectors that are equal according to the lexicographic order , i.e. @xmath60 for all @xmath32 , will also have equal decay centralities .",
    "the following result covers the remaining cases .",
    "[ proplowdeltageneral ] exists @xmath43 such that for all @xmath44 and @xmath45 , if @xmath61 then @xmath47 , where @xmath62    propositions [ proplowdelta ] and [ proplowdeltageneral ] allow the comparison of decay centralities between any pair of nodes for low values of @xmath5 .",
    "we proceed in a similar way to obtain the respective results for high values of @xmath5 .",
    "[ prophighdelta ] exists @xmath63 such that for all @xmath64 and @xmath45 , if @xmath65 then @xmath47 .",

    "[ corhighdelta ] exists @xmath63 such that for all @xmath64 holds that @xmath66 .",
    "similarly to the previous case , proposition [ prophighdelta ] does not allow the comparison between nodes with equal closeness centralities . in order to do so",
    "it is necessary to define for each node the vector @xmath67 , with typical element @xmath68 , where @xmath69 by definition .",
    "observe that @xmath70 , i.e. the _ farness _ of node @xmath3 .",
    "note that , the rest of the terms of vector @xmath71 are related to the derivatives of farness , which is a different interpretation compared to @xmath72 .",
    "continuously differentiable functions in @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , @xmath75 for all @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then , there is @xmath78 such that for all @xmath79 it holds that @xmath80 if @xmath81 is even and @xmath82 if @xmath81 is odd .",
    "@xmath83 denotes @xmath32-th order derivative of @xmath84 . ]",
    "based on this definition , one can also define the vector @xmath85 , where @xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 if @xmath89 for all @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 corresponds to the closeness centrality , thus the overscript will often be omitted , and the following equivalence relations hold always .",
    "[ remarkfarclos ] @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is important to underline that such an equivalence does not hold for all orders .",
    "for instance , it does not hold for the _ unsorted dominance order _ that is defined and used later in the article .",
    "having said that , we are ready to provide a result that determines the complete order among nodes in terms of decay centrality .",
    "[ prophighdeltageneral ] exists @xmath63 such that for all @xmath64 and @xmath45 , if @xmath94 then @xmath47 , where @xmath95    the results so far have established a clear relation between decay centrality , degree and closeness , in the two limits , which provides a more intuitive picture of the characteristics of nodes with high decay centrality for some values of the decay parameter .",
    "however , the established relations still leave unanswered what happens for intermediate values of @xmath5",
    ".    given two vectors of real numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 the first one is larger than the second one according to the _ unsorted dominance order _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath96 , if @xmath97 for all @xmath90 and at least one of the inequalities is strict .",
    "[ defunsorteddominance ]    we use the term _ unsorted _ because the standard definition of dominance order considers vectors whose elements are already sorted in decreasing order , which is not the case here . moreover , notice that _ unsorted dominance _ is a partial order , thus it may not allow the comparison between all nodes .",
    "finally , observe that , under certain assumptions on the vectors under comparison , the unsorted dominance order can be seen as a deterministic analog of _ first order stochastic dominance_.    definition [ defunsorteddominance ] allows us to establish the following result :    for @xmath45 , if @xmath98 then @xmath47 for all @xmath40 .",
    "[ propintermediatedeltadomdeg ]    despite not providing a complete order , the result grasps the important relation between degree and closeness in the calculation of decay centrality . on one hand",
    "a high degree is beneficial as it is included in all sums @xmath99 , on the other hand , high closeness implies , though indirectly , that a higher number of nodes will be in a shorter distance from @xmath3 , thus boosting all relevant sums upwards .",
    "a similar result can be established using the relation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 as follows :    for @xmath45 , if @xmath102 then @xmath47 for all @xmath40 .",
    "[ propintermediatedeltadomfar ]    observe that the subscripts in the first relation are reversed compared to proposition [ propintermediatedeltadomdeg ] , meaning that lower values of the elements of @xmath100 are associated with higher decay centrality .",
    "additionally , as it has already been mentioned , there is no equivalence relation between @xmath71 and @xmath103 with respect to _ unsorted dominance _",
    ", thus the result needs to be stated using the vector associated with farness , rather than the one associated with closeness .",
    "the next result , builds upon propositions [ proplowdelta ] and [ proplowdeltageneral ] , as it provides several sufficient conditions that characterize nodes with high decay centrality for values of @xmath104 .",
    "namely ,    [ propdeltalowerhalf ] consider two distinct nodes @xmath45 and let @xmath105 and @xmath106 for all @xmath107 . then , if @xmath108 either of the following four conditions is sufficient to ensure that @xmath47 for all @xmath109 $ ] .    2    1 .",

    "@xmath111 3 .",
    "@xmath112 4 .",
    "@xmath113    the essence of all conditions is that as long as node @xmath3 has sufficiently many more immediate neighbors than node @xmath4 ( high @xmath114 ) then node @xmath3 has higher decay centrality not only very close to the limit , but for a large range of values of @xmath5 .",
    "the first two conditions provide also a simple illustration of the higher relative importance of closer neighbors compared to more distant ones , which is essential for decay centrality",
    ". a closer look at the proof of proposition [ propdeltalowerhalf ] reveals that the conditions are relatively demanding and the bounds are not tight , which is to be expected given that they hold for any potential network structure .",
    "the next result establishes similar conditions for high values of @xmath5 , where high decay centrality is more closely associated with low farness .",
    "namely ,    [ propdeltaupperhalf ] consider two distinct nodes @xmath45 and let @xmath115 and @xmath116 for all @xmath107 . then , if @xmath117 either of the following two conditions is sufficient to ensure that @xmath47 for all @xmath118 .    2    1 .",
    "@xmath119 2 .",
    "@xmath120    propositions [ propdeltalowerhalf ] and [ propdeltaupperhalf ] provide a connection between decay centrality , degree and closeness for values that extend away from the limits .",
    "an important observation is that @xmath121 is the maximum upper bound for which conditions 3 and 4 of proposition [ propdeltalowerhalf ] guarantee the order of decay centralities , given that the remaining conditions hold .",
    "similarly , @xmath121 is also the minimum lower bound for which conditions 1 and 2 of proposition [ propdeltaupperhalf ] guarantee the order of decay centralities , given that the remaining conditions hold .",
    "this last observation provides a natural motivation for the rule  of - thumb that is proposed in the next section .",
    "the theoretical results have provided several conditions that support the relation between decay centrality , degree and closeness .",
    "nevertheless , some of these conditions may not be easily satisfied in certain networks .",
    "for this reason , we perform an extensive set of simulations that intends to identify how strong this relation is in general networks .",
    "in particular , we focus on analyzing the extent to which the set of nodes with maximum decay centrality , @xmath122 , coincides with either @xmath123 or @xmath124 ( or both ) for different values of the decay parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we simulate undirected rdos - renyi networks @xcite , @xmath125 , where @xmath15 is the network size and @xmath126 is the link probability .",
    "the networks are required to be connected so that geodesic distances are well defined .",
    "we consider five network sizes , @xmath127 and ten link probabilities @xmath128 and perform 10000 trials for each combination @xmath129 . , some additional figures and some extensions .",
    "additional figures are available upon request . ]",
    "the first question is how often @xmath122 , i.e. the set of nodes with maximum decay centrality , intersects with either @xmath123 , i.e. the set of nodes with maximum degree , or with @xmath124 , i.e. the set of nodes with maximum closeness .",
    "we find that in the vast majority of the cases @xmath130 for almost all values of @xmath5 and not only for the limit values .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath123 intersects with @xmath124 quite often for random networks .",
    "the reasons why this occurs are outside the scope of this paper , however it has an apparent effect on our results as it provides a natural connection between the two limit cases explored by theory .",
    "in fact , in `` almost all '' cases where there are nodes that belong both to @xmath123 and @xmath124 , those nodes also belong to @xmath122 .",
    "this result can not be generalized as there are cases in which , for some values of @xmath5 , the nodes with maximum decay centrality do not belong to either @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless , as it becomes apparent from tables  [ table::coinciding ] and  [ table::coincidingandintermediate ] the frequency with which such cases arise is practically negligible .",
    ".frequency of occassions where @xmath131 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we turn our attention to the case where @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not intersect . in this case",
    ", we expect from theory a transition in the nodes that belong to @xmath122 as @xmath5 increases .",
    "it turns out that most of the times the transition is immediate , meaning that any node in @xmath122 belongs to either @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "this can become apparent in figure  [ fig::frequency ] , which contains the percentage frequencies with which @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "for each value of @xmath5 the frequencies correspond to the fraction of the simulated networks in which each of the three conditions held true .",
    "the fact that in the left subfigure @xmath123 and @xmath124 can intersect means that the sum of the frequencies may exceed 100% , which seems to be the case rather often .",
    "this is no longer possible in the right subfigure , where we include only the cases where @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not intersect , therefore the three conditions are mutually exclusive .",
    "note that , observing a node that maximizes decay centrality without belonging either to @xmath123 or @xmath124 is never observed in more than a 2% of the trials , with the percentage becoming much lower away from @xmath13 .",
    "this suggests that for most networks there is a threshold value of @xmath5 below which @xmath132 and above which @xmath133 .",
    "+    figures  [ fig::histpernet_prob05_to10 ] and [ fig::histpernet_prob15_to20 ] contain the three percentage frequencies of interest for all network sizes and values of @xmath135 , focusing on networks where @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not intersect .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar in all configurations , presenting an inverted s - shaped curve for the frequency of @xmath132 , an s - shaped curve for @xmath133 and an inverted bell curve for @xmath134 .",
    "+   +     +   +    the latter one never exceeds 10% , with this being the case only for @xmath136 and values of @xmath5 close to 0.5 .",
    "we also observe the transition of maximizers of decay centrality from belonging to the set of nodes with maximum degree to that of nodes with maximum closeness occurs for lower values of @xmath5 as networks become larger , with the result being more prevalent for low values of @xmath126 ; as @xmath126 increases we observe a sharp transition occurring for @xmath5 around 0.5 .",
    "there are very few observations where @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not intersect . ]    at this point one might wonder what is the rank in terms of decay centrality of nodes with maximum degree and closeness , when they are not ranked first ? figures  [ fig::rank_degree_p05_allnets ] and  [ fig::rank_closeness_p05_allnets ] show the average rank , as well as the 5th and 95th percentiles of rank distribution in decay centrality of nodes with maximum degree and closeness respectively .",
    "it turns out that nodes belonging to @xmath123 or @xmath124 are highly ranked in terms of decay centrality for all values of @xmath5 , even when they are not ranked first .",
    "the result is similar if we exclude the networks in which @xmath123 and @xmath124 intersect .",
    "0.63    0.63    0.63    0.63    0.63    0.63    nevertheless , focusing only on degree or only on closeness leads to increasingly suboptimal choices as @xmath5 moves towards the extremes .",
    "hence , it remains unclear which of the two sets would provide better candidates depending on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "ideally , we would like to have a simple rule of thumb that would facilitate this choice .",
    "a natural rule would be to choose a node from @xmath123 for @xmath137 and a node from @xmath124 for @xmath138 .",
    "given that the two sets usually contain few nodes , it should not be too costly to calculate the decay centrality of each of these nodes and pick the one that maximizes it .",
    "it turns out that this rule of thumb is sufficient to ensure that the chosen node will be highly ranked in terms of decay centrality .",
    "figure  [ fig::rank_combined_p05_allnets ] shows the same statistics as figures [ fig::rank_degree_p05_allnets ] and [ fig::rank_closeness_p05_allnets ] for @xmath136 and all network sizes , in which it can be seen that in all networks a node chosen according to this rule will be ranked in terms of decay centrality among the top three with probability 95% .",
    "additional figures in the online appendix suggest that the result is robust to different parameter values and even for networks with 1000 nodes .    0.625    0.625    0.625",
    "we have established , both analytically and numerically , a relation between decay centrality , degree and closeness , showing that nodes that maximize one of the two measures are natural candidates for maximizing decay centrality as well .",
    "in fact , the majority of networks has a threshold value of @xmath5 below which maximum decay centrality coincides with maximum degree and above which it coincides with maximum closeness .",
    "we show that a simple rule of thumb that considers a common threshold at @xmath13 performs particularly well .",
    "it still remains rather unexplored whether there are particular characteristics of the network that can allow the accurate characterization of this threshold value with some accuracy .",
    "finally , simulations are limited to networks of small to medium size . in the online appendix",
    "we provide some additional support in favor of our results by considering networks with 1000 nodes , however a more systematic extension of the analysis to large networks would ensure their applicability to problems where decay centrality has been shown to play an important role .",
