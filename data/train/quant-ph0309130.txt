    "in 1984 , berry @xcite proposed in a seminal paper that a quantum system in a pure state undergoing adiabatic cyclic evolution acquires a geometric phase .",
    "this discovery has prompted a myriad of activities on various aspects of geometric phase in many areas of physics ranging from optical fibers to anyons .",
    "simon @xcite subsequently recast the mathematical formalism of berry s phase within the language of differential geometry and fiber bundles . while it is possible to consider berry s phase under adiabatic evolution , the extension to non - adiabatic evolution is usually non - trivial . the general formalism for the non - adiabatic extension",
    "was formulated by aharonov and anandan @xcite .",
    "samuel and bhandari @xcite further generalized the geometric phase by extending it to non - cyclic evolution and sequential measurements .",
    "further relaxation on the adiabatic , unitary , and cyclic properties of the evolution have since been carried out @xcite .",
    "the concept of geometric phase of mixed states has also been developed .",
    "uhlmann @xcite was probably first to address this issue within the mathematical context of purification .",
    "@xcite have introduced a new formalism that defines the mixed state geometric phase within the experimental context of quantum interferometry . as pointed out by slater @xcite ,",
    "these two approaches are not equivalent , and ericsson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently shown that the parallel transport conditions used in the two approaches lead to generically distinct phase holonomy effects for entangled systems undergoing certain local unitary transformations .",
    "@xcite have given a kinematic formalism of the mixed state geometric phase with non - degenerate eigenvalues and generalized the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to degenerate states .",
    "extension of ref .",
    "@xcite to the off - diagonal case @xcite and completely positive maps @xcite have also been given .",
    "an experimental test of ref .",
    "@xcite in the qubit case has been reported @xcite , using nuclear magnetic resonance technique .",
    "the geometric phase of entangled states should be another issue worthy of attention .",
    "it may hold a potential application in holonomic quantum computation since the study of entangled spin systems effectively allows us to contemplate the design of a solid state quantum computer @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found that one could in principle devise more robust fault - tolerant quantum computations using the notion of geometric phase in designing a conditional phase shift gate @xcite . since the geometric phase depends solely on the geometry of the intrinsic spin space , it is deemed to be less susceptible to noise from the environment . as for the geometric phase of entangled states itself , sjqvist @xcite considered the geometric phase for a pair of entangled spin@xmath0 systems in a time - independent uniform magnetic field , and the relative phase for polarization - entangled two - photon systems has been considered by hessmo and sjqvist @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the geometric phase for a pair of entangled spin@xmath0 systems in a rotating magnetic field . another interesting question , which has been mentioned in the previous papers but has not been completely discussed , is the relation between geometric phase of the entangled state and those of the subsystems .    in this paper , we consider a general entangled bi - partite system under an arbitrary bi - local unitary evolution .",
    "we extend the conclusions obtained from the special mode in @xcite to the general case .",
    "that is , we prove that the geometric phase for cyclic entangled states with non - degenerate eigenvalues under bi - local unitary evolution can always be decomposed into a sum of weighted non - modular pure state phases pertaining to the separable components of the schmidt decomposition , irrespective of forms of local evolution operators .",
    "however , we also see that this property does not manifest itself in the case of non - cyclic evolutions .",
    "moreover , we investigate the relation between the geometric phase of pure entangled states of the system and that of mixed states of the subsystem and conclude that the geometric phase of mixed states of one subsystem is different from that of entangled states in general even if we do not act on the other subsystem .",
    "we also point out that the two phases are equal when the evolution operator only acts on the considered subsystem and satisfies conditions where each pure state component of the schmidt decomposition is parallel transported .",
    "we begin by considering a quantum system @xmath1 consisting of two subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 subject to the bi - local unitary evolution @xmath4 .",
    "the states of the system belong to the hilbert space @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two complex hilbert spaces with dimensions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "vectors in @xmath10 can be expanded as schmidt decompositions .",
    "thus , any normalized initial state of the system can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are orthonormal bases of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , @xmath14 , and the schmidt coefficients @xmath15 fulfill @xmath16 . when @xmath17 acts on @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath22 is a pure state , its geometric phase can be obtained by removing the dynamical phase from the total phase . as we know , when a pure state evolves from @xmath23 to @xmath24 along a path @xmath25  in projective hilbert space , the non - adiabatic geometric phase can be obtained as @xmath26 with total phase @xmath27 and dynamical phase @xmath28 .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 to mark total , dynamical , and geometric phases , respectively ; and we use @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 to represent instantaneous time , finite time , and period of cyclic evolution , respectively . with eqs .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) , we obtain the total , dynamical , and geometric phase of the entangled state @xmath35 under a bi - local unitary evolution @xmath36 as @xmath37 eq .",
    "( [ bab ] ) entails that the dynamical phase can always be separated into two parts corresponding to the evolution of each of the subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , the total phase as well as the geometric phase can not be separated into two parts in general .",
    "the latter observation arises primarily from the entanglement of the two subsystems .",
    "in this section , we specialize the above discussion to cyclic states with non - degenerate schmidt coefficients @xmath38 . such states are characterized by the existence of a period @xmath34 such that @xmath39 that is , @xmath40 as @xmath41 and @xmath42 are unitary , the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also orthonormal bases of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . moreover , under consideration that the @xmath38 s are non - degenerate , i.e. , that @xmath45 for all pairs @xmath46 , the schmidt decomposition is unique .",
    "so , we have @xmath47 , which implies @xmath48 ,   \\label{ab = ab } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 . since the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ab = ab ] ) is independent of the summation index @xmath50 , @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52   \\nonumber\\\\    & & = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n } p_i \\big [ \\arg \\langle\\mu_i |   u_a(t ) |\\mu_i\\rangle + \\arg \\langle \\nu_i |u_b(t)|    \\nu_i\\rangle + 2\\pi \\tilde{n}_i \\big ]    \\label{ab = sab } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are integers chosen as @xmath54 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ bab ] ) and ( [ ab = sab ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gab ] ) yields @xmath55 ,    \\label{a = a } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are just the @xmath57modular geometric phases of the pure states @xmath58 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the `` winding numbers '' @xmath59 are integers and originate from the non - modular nature of the pure state dynamical phases @xcite and the integers @xmath60 .",
    "( [ a = a ] ) shows that the cyclic geometric phase for non - degenerate entangled states under a bi - local unitary evolution can always be decomposed into a sum of weighted pure state phases pertaining to the evolution of each schmidt component .",
    "this is primarily a result of the uniqueness of the schmidt decomposition , which entails that the schmidt basis of the initial and final state must be identical if all @xmath38 are different .",
    "the contribution from the non - modular nature of the dynamical phases to the winding numbers @xmath59 can be determined in a history - dependent manner @xcite by continuously monitoring the dynamical phase for each separate component of the schmidt decomposition on the time interval @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "in such a procedure , each @xmath62 is the modulus @xmath63 remainder of the corresponding dynamical phase .    to illustrate the significance of the winding numbers ,",
    "consider a pair of qubits ( two - level systems ) being initially in the entangled state @xmath64 with @xmath65 , and evolving under influence of the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 the identity operator on @xmath7 . as the schmidt components @xmath69 and @xmath70 are eigenstates of @xmath71 , their corresponding @xmath57modular geometric phases @xmath72 and @xmath73 all vanish .",
    "however , they acquire different dynamical phases causing a non - trivial evolution of the entangled state . for one cycle",
    "@xmath74 one obtains @xmath75 and @xmath76 , yielding the total geometric phase @xmath77 which is non - trivial for entangled states .",
    "the above result concerning the phase of cyclic entangled states may provide some insight regarding the geometric phase of mixed states .",
    "certainly , the state given by eq .",
    "( [ psit ] ) is a pure state with density matrix @xmath78 .",
    "however , if we trace out the state of subsystem @xmath3 , we obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath79 corresponding to mixed states of subsystem @xmath2 . by the reduced density matrix",
    ", we can deduce the geometric phase @xmath80 of a mixed state . here , we wish to examine , in the case where @xmath81 is the identity map @xmath68 , the relation between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) , tracing out the state of subsystem @xmath3 , we obtain the evolution of the reduced density matrix for subsystem @xmath2 as @xmath84 with @xmath85 for non - degenerate @xmath38 , the geometric phase of @xmath86 is found as @xcite @xmath87 this expression is valid for both cyclic and non - cyclic states . in the cyclic case @xmath88 we have @xmath89 , and the above equation can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the geometric phase of the pure state @xmath58 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ mgl ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ a = a ] ) for @xmath92 , we find @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the cyclic geometric phase of the whole system is in general different from that of the mixed state of the considered subsystem , basically because the former is a weighted sum of pure state phases while the latter is a weighted sum of pure state phase factors .",
    "similarly , for non - cyclic evolution with @xmath94 , we have in general @xmath95 and @xmath96 thus , the geometric phase of the system @xmath1 is dependent upon @xmath58 of subsystem @xmath2 but independent of @xmath13 of @xmath3 .",
    "only the evolution of subsystem @xmath2 contributes to the geometric phase of the pure state system .",
    "yet , we find that , even in the case when the system s geometric phase is completely determined by the evolution of subsystem @xmath2 and the schmidt coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 is generally different from @xmath99 both in the cyclic and non - cyclic case .",
    "it may seem unexpected , because only subsystem @xmath2 experiences a unitary evolution while subsystem @xmath3 is unaffected .",
    "the geometric phase of the system @xmath1 is attributed to @xmath100 only , and it seems natural to expect the phase obtained by the system to be same as that obtained by subsystem @xmath2 , while regarding it as mixed state .",
    "however , they are different .",
    "this shows that the geometric phase of an entangled bi - partite system is always affected by both subsystems .",
    "in this section , we again restrict our discussion to the case where @xmath94 . as pointed out above , even in this case ,",
    "the geometric phase of the system , which is determined only by the evolution of subsystem @xmath2 and the schmidt coefficients @xmath97 , is generally different from that of the corresponding mixed state .",
    "we now try to find the reason for the difference and give conditions under which the two phases are equal .    under the evolution @xmath94",
    ", the state of the whole system is @xmath101 \\otimes |\\nu_i\\rangle$ ] , which can also be expressed as the density matrix @xmath102 \\otimes     \\label{rhoab } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding mixed state of the subsystem @xmath2 is @xmath103 when @xmath100 is given , the states @xmath104 and @xmath105 are definite , but when @xmath104 or @xmath105 is given , the evolution operator is not unique .",
    "that is , for a given path in state space , there are infinitely many unitary operators that realize the same path and so give the same geometric phase .",
    "all the operators form an equivalence set : two evolution operators are ` equivalent ' if and only if they realize the same path .",
    "if we know any one operator out of the equivalence set , say @xmath106 , we can write down all the operators of the set . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the equivalence set is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is an arbitrary real - valued gauge function of @xmath32 with @xmath109 . for state @xmath105 ,",
    "the equivalence set is @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , are arbitrary real - valued gauge functions of @xmath32 with @xmath113 .",
    "we see that the two sets are different in general and @xmath114 , which shows that the evolution operators that give the same path for @xmath105 may give different paths for @xmath104 .",
    "so the two kinds of geometric phases @xmath115 and @xmath99 can not be the same in general , otherwise they should be associated with the same equivalence sets of evolution operators . to see exactly the difference between the two phases , we substitute @xmath116 into eqs .",
    "( [ mg ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) , respectively , and get @xmath117 we see that @xmath99 is invariant under choice of member in @xmath118 , while @xmath115 is not as it depends upon @xmath111 .    with the above analysis",
    ", we can conclude that , for a given local evolution operator @xmath100 , the two phases @xmath115 and @xmath99 are different in general .",
    "but when can they be the same , that is , for what kinds of @xmath100 can we consider the two phases to be the same ? we prove that when the evolution operator @xmath100 satisfies ` the stronger parallel transport conditions ' @xcite @xmath119 the two phases are the same .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ spc ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ mg ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) , we find @xmath120 and @xmath121 eqs .",
    "( [ a = am ] ) and ( [ b = bm ] ) show that the two kinds of geometric phase for unitarities of the form @xmath122 are always the same when the evolution operator @xmath100 satisfies the stronger parallel transport conditions eq .",
    "( [ spc ] ) .    substituting @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an arbitrary unitary operator .",
    "so we see that when @xmath100 holds the form of eq .",
    "( [ sua ] ) , the geometric phase of the pure state of the system under the evolution @xmath94 is the same as that of the mixed state of subsystem @xmath2 under the evolution @xmath100 .",

    "in the upper panel , the pure state phase @xmath125 is measured as a shift in the coincidence interference oscillations obtained at detectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 by varying the @xmath128 phase @xmath129 . in the lower panel , the mixed state phase @xmath130 , with @xmath131 the mixed input state of subsystem @xmath132 , is similarly measured as a shift at @xmath126 by ignoring the subsystem @xmath133.,width=8 ]    it might also be useful to consider the problem from an operational point of view .",
    "let us first consider the two - particle franson type interferometry setup shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 , with internal pure state @xmath18 affected by @xmath122 in the longer arms and by a @xmath128 shift @xmath129 to one of the shorter arms . to observe the relative phase between @xmath18 and @xmath134 , we require that the source produces particle pairs randomly .",
    "then , if the particles arrive at the two detectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 simultaneously , they both either took the upper path or the lower path , so that the intensity detected in coincidence at @xmath126 and @xmath127 becomes @xcite @xmath135 shifts the interference oscillations when @xmath129 varies . to observe the phase of @xmath136 acquired by subsystem @xmath132 alone , we instead use the setup shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "suppose now we first arrange these experiments so that @xmath100 yields the pure state parallel transport condition @xmath139 . in this case",
    ", the interference pattern obtained by measuring on both subsystems in coincidence would be shifted by the pure state geometric phase @xmath140 . on other hand , measuring only on subsystem @xmath132 would yield the same shift , but the interpretation is different : it is the total phase @xmath141 acquired by @xmath142 , which is in general at variance with @xmath143 as this latter phase is based upon the stronger parallel transport conditions .",
    "the situation is different when setting up @xmath100 so as to parallel transport @xmath105 , i.e. , by implementing @xmath100 according to eq .",
    "( [ sua ] ) . here ,",
    "the coincidence and marginal interference pattern are shifted by @xmath140 and @xmath143 , respectively , in accordance with the above analysis .",
    "we have discussed geometric phases of entangled states of bi - partite systems under bi - local unitary evolution and of the mixed states of their subsystems .",
    "we conclude :    1 .",
    "the cyclic geometric phase for entangled states with non - degenerate eigenvalues under bi - local unitary evolution can always be decomposed into a sum of weighted non - modular pure state phases pertaining to the separable components of the schmidt decomposition , irrespective of forms of local evolution operators , though the same can not be said for the non - cyclic geometric phase .",
    "the mixed state geometric phase of one subsystem is generally different from that of the entangled state even by keeping the other subsystem fixed , though it seems as if the two phases might be same .",
    "however , when the evolution operator satisfies the stronger parallel transport conditions for mixed states , the two phases are the same , and the general form of the operators are given .",
    "the difference between geometric phases of bi - partite systems and their parts has its primary cause in entanglement and thus vanishes in the limit of separable states .",
    "we hope that the present analysis may trigger multi - particle experiments to test the difference between phases of entangled systems and their subsystems .",
