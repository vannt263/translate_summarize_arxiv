    "we show now that the observed behavior of these three ins peaks in a magnetic field can be qualitatively understood in terms of an @xmath54 triplet whose degeneracy in zero field has been lifted by an anisotropy mechanism rooted in the coordination environment of the four outer cro@xmath39 octahedra .",
    "specifically , a closer inspection of the individual chromium ligand field environments in the molecular structure of cr@xmath0-cubane reveals that two types of coordination environments need to be differentiated@xcite .",

    "although the three zero - field eigenvalues of @xmath94 are independent of a molecule s orientation , this is not the case for @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , in order to describe an actual polycrystalline sample of \\{cr@xmath0}-cubane in the presence of a magnetic field , we have diagonalized @xmath94 for many ( @xmath95 ) uniformly distributed orientations of the cartesian axes for each value of @xmath18 .",
    "each orientation produces a different set of three eigenvalues , and as the number of orientations becomes very large , these form three continuous distributions ( bands ) of energies . to show the variation of these distributions with field , we have calculated the mean value of each distribution plus(minus ) its standard deviation , which define the energy bands that are shown in fig .",
    "[ bands1](b ) .",

    "we have attempted to resolve this discrepancy by assuming the presence of independent paramagnetic impurities , i.e. , by adding a curie term , @xmath111 , to the susceptibility of the four - level model .",

    "these peaks show that this lowest s = 1 multiplet is split , even in zero magnetic field , which is unexplainable in terms of the heisenberg hamiltonian.@xcite the magnitude of the zero - field splitting ( 0.16 mev ) is comparable to that observed for the antiferromagnetic ring [ cr@xmath0f@xmath0piv@xmath7.@xcite    we attribute the observed field dependence of the ins data as being due to the effects of anisotropy not included in the initial ( heisenberg ) hamiltonian , and we hence supplement that hamiltonian with an additional perturbing term , given in eq .",

    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering in variable magnetic field and high - field magnetization measurements , at the milikelvin temperature range , were performed to gain insight into the low - energy magnetic excitation spectrum and the field - induced level crossings in the molecular spin cluster \\{cr@xmath0}-cubane . </S>",
    "<S> these complementary techniques provide consistent estimates of the lowest level - crossing field . </S>",
