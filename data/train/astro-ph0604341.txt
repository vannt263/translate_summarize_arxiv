    "it is generally accepted that the outburst of a classical nova is due to a thermonuclear runaway in a hydrogen - rich envelope accreted onto a white dwarf in a semi - detached binary system .",
    "the outburst ejects @xmath10m@xmath11 of matter from the white dwarf surface with velocities up to several thousand km s@xmath4 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the study of nova outburst has consequences for a number of areas , including the study of nucleosynthesis in the accreted envelope , the processes of dust formation in the ejected matter , and the gas dynamics and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium .",
    "the shapes of the outburst ejecta provide an insight into the physical processes that occur during outbursts .",
    "deep imaging and spectroscopic observations of old nova remnants have revealed that many of them have asymmetric structures , such as prolate shells including rings and blobs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , polarimetry has revealed that the asymmetric geometry was already present at the outburst phase for many novae @xcite . however , despite the accumulation of observational facts , it is still not clear what gives rise to departures from spherical symmetry in nova ejecta .    in a typical model of nova mass loss in the outburst phase ,",
    "the ejecta are presumed to consist of an initially ejected main shell and a steadily blowing faster wind . in this model ,",
    "the different expansion velocities of the shell and the wind should cause them to collide . using such an interacting wind model ,",
    "@xcite carried out hydrodynamic simulations of the ejecta and were able to explain some of the observed structures , such as polar blobs and equatorial bands . in their model , the secondary star experiences a frictional drag force inside the common envelope and transfers angular momentum to the ejecta ( cf . , @xcite ) , causing a fast anisotropic flow that collides with the outer spherical shell .",
    "however , the effects of a rapidly rotating white dwarf may also be important @xcite .",
    "centrifugal forces reduce the effective surface gravity of the white dwarf at the equator and the electron degeneracy at the base of the accreted envelope becomes stronger at the poles . the ejected material gains higher velocities in the polar regions than at the equator regions , which gives rise to a high - velocity bipolar outflow .",
    "more recently , a transient high - velocity emission component was found in nova v1494 aql during its transition phase @xcite , and @xcite suggested that a temporary increase in the accretion rate resulted in the formation of a jet at the inner boundary of a reformed accretion disk ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies assume or predict that the nova wind is highly asymmetric .",
    "if free electrons inside high - velocity winds scatter substantial amounts of the nlte line emission from lower - velocity regions near the central star , redshifted , polarized light can be expected to contribute to the net flux , which will result in a broad red wing associated with an emission line in the polarized flux spectrum .",
    "thus , spectropolarimetry with substantial wavelength resolution has the potential to provide us with unique information on the structure and kinematics of nova winds .",
    "nova v475 sct (= nova scuti 2003 ) was discovered by h. nishimura on 2003 august 28.58 ut @xcite and reached its maximum brightness of @xmath12 on september 1.77 ut ( jd = @xmath13 ; @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper",

    "@xcite reported that the precise position is @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and that no object is found within @xmath18 on the red 1984 dss image or 1999 2mass public images .",
    "the @xmath19-band lightcurve showed small irregular variations in the early decline phase , followed by a deep decline at @xmath20 d @xcite .",
    "the early decline rate of v475 sct was @xmath21 d d from aavso light curve data , which is considerably shorter than that derived by @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "we adopt the latter because the maximum brightness @xmath22 in @xcite is based on the very short flare seen in the curve around september 1.8 ut and such a short variation would have been unlikely to be considered in classifications of earlier novae , and @xcite took the dip seen in the lightcurve on 2003 september 2330 ( @xmath23 ) into account in deriving @xmath24 ; however , this dip seems likely to be a local oscillation rather than a general brightness variation , given the global tendency of the lightcurve .",

    "an optical spectrum obtained around maximum brightness @xcite displayed many emission lines such as and balmer series lines , characteristic of novae @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted the photometric and spectroscopic similarities to v705 cas and suggested that v475 sct is a dusty nova @xcite . in this paper , we present the results of our spectropolarimetry of v475 sct in its outburst phase and discuss a high - velocity component seen in the polarized spectrum .",
    "we took low - resolution spectropolarimetry measurements of v475 sct with hbs ( the acronym stands for ` henkou - bunkou - sokkou - ki , ' which means ` spectro - photo - polarimeter ' in japanese ; @xcite ) attached to the cassegrain focus of the 0.91-m telescope at the okayama astrophysical observatory of naoj on 2003 september 26 , 28 , and 29 ut ( 25 , 27 , and 28 d , respectively ) .",

    "this configuration resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath35   and @xmath36 .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ hbsred _ package @xcite .",
    "both the instrumental polarization and depolarization were derived from unpolarized standard star ( up ; @xcite ) data obtained with and without inserting a glan - taylor prism .",
    "the zero point of the position angle was determined from the observations of strongly polarized standard stars ( sp ; @xcite ) in the synthesized @xmath19 band .",
    "all the adopted calibration data were obtained during the 2003 july  september run with the same focal slitlets as used for the nova observations .",
    "the magnitude of the derived instrumental polarization was approximated by a smooth function of wavelength . to give some examples ,",
    "its magnitude was @xmath37 % at 5000   and @xmath38 % at 8000   ( the error is the mean error of a total 31 up observations ) . this instrumental polarization was vectorially subtracted from the observational data .",
    "the polarimetric stability , estimated from the peak - to - peak variation of up polarization in the observation period ( a total of four observations for 107  psc and @xmath39 cet ) , was less than 0.1 % over the observed wavelength range .",
    "a correction was also made for the zero point of the position angle ; its accuracy is estimated to be @xmath40 , which is the @xmath41 range for a total of 11 sp observations during the july  september run .",
    "our other spectropolarimetric observations of v475 sct were carried out with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) , attached to the cassegrain focus of the 8.2-m subaru telescope @xcite on 2003 october 7.29 ut ( 36 d ) .",
    "the polarimetric module consists of a rotating superachromatic half - wave plate and a fixed quartz wollaston prism ( manufactured by b. halle nachfl . ) , and both the ordinary and the extraordinary rays are simultaneously recorded on two mit / ll ccds ( 2k@xmath344k , 15/pixel ) .",
    "we used a @xmath42 width @xmath43 length slit and a 665 lines mm@xmath4 volume - phase holographic ( vph ) grism @xcite , which gives a wavelength coverage of 53007700   and a spectral resolution of @xmath44   and @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding reciprocal spectral dispersion was @xmath46  / pixel .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the highest resolution spectropolarimetry for a classical nova in the literature . to eliminate the contamination due to second - order spectra , a sharp - cut filter y47 was used together with the vph grism .",
    "the observation consisted of two sets of four sequential integrations at the @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 positions of the half - wave plate ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the frames were reduced using the standard methods for ccd spectroscopy . since no nearby object was seen in the images we obtained , we estimated the sky background component by a simple interpolation of the spectra at both sides of the object along the slit .",
    "the measurements of flatfield lamps through fully polarizing filters indicated that the depolarization factor was negligible ( @xmath47 ) and we made no correction for it .",
    "the zero point of the position angle on the sky was determined from the sp observation @xcite .",
    "the typical accuracy of the position angle is estimated to be @xmath48 , which is the @xmath41 value for a total of 13 observations of hd  204827 in 2002 june through 2003 june .",
    "higher - resolution spectropolarimetry ( @xmath49 ) sometimes suffers from a strong spectral modulation in polarization ( _ ripple _ pattern ) due to multiple reflections within the wave plate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in that case",
    "some method must be applied , as part of the data reduction procedure , to remove the pattern ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the polarization spectra obtained for the unpolarized star hd  212311 with the same optical configuration as the target observation .",
    "one can observe that the peak amplitude is less than @xmath50 %  in the instrumental @xmath51 spectra and that the ripple pattern is not significant in our data .",
    "one possible reason for this is that the somewhat poorer surface accuracy of the wave plate , due to the four block construction for a large aperture ( 125 mm @xmath52 ) , effectively reduces the ripple effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , we were able to analyze the data in a standard way , except for the application of a slight correction for the nearly wavelength - independent instrumental polarization ( @xmath53 % ; figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "many calibration observations during 20022003 suggest that the polarimetric stability and accuracy of subaru / focas are equal to or less than @xmath54 % @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows the low - dispersion spectra of v475 sct on 25 , 27 and 28 d. we see many prominent emission lines , e.g. , balmer series ,  d @xmath555890,5896 , @xmath567773 , @xmath568446 , ir triplet and multiplets . at this epoch",
    "the [ ] @xmath556300,6364 forbidden emission lines are still weak . in the medium - dispersion spectrum obtained on 36 d ( figure [ fig3]a ) , we can see resolved features of these lines at 53007700 . the d doublet shows complicated features consisting of multiple p cygni profiles , on which sharp interstellar absorption lines are superimposed at @xmath57 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the permitted lines , h@xmath2 and @xmath566248 , have p cygni absorption components at @xmath58 and @xmath59 km s@xmath4 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "thus , it appears that this component was accelerated principally at 1424 d during the @xmath6440 post - maximum days",
    ". however , the latter , faster component seems to correspond to the feature that was seen at @xmath65 km s@xmath4 on 14 d , and @xmath66 km s@xmath4 on 24 d @xcite , which implies a monotonic acceleration for this component . the forbidden [ ]",
    "@xmath556300,6364 lines are well developed by the epoch of our medium - dispersion observations .",
    "the profile of [ ] @xmath566300 has a flat top and steep edges at both sides , suggesting that the lines originate in the expanding shell ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm/2 of this emission line is @xmath67 km s@xmath4 , which is comparable with the blueshift of the p - cyg absorption component seen in h@xmath2 and @xmath566248 .",
    "these are consistent with a picture in which v475 sct at that epoch had a main shell expanding at a velocity of @xmath68 km s@xmath4 and a nova wind with a speed @xmath69 times faster than the shell along the line of sight .",
    "we note that the h@xmath2 emission line has a considerably asymmetric profile , with a red wing extending beyond @xmath70 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we will discuss the origin of the broad red wing in  3.3 .",
    "aligned nonspherical dust grains in interstellar media produce interstellar polarization ( isp ) . in order to evaluate the component of polarization intrinsic to the nova",
    ", the isp must be properly subtracted from the observed polarization .",
    "taking into account that the position angle ( pa ) of the intrinsic polarization , @xmath71 , and that of the isp , @xmath72 , are independent of each other , and also the fact that @xmath72 is almost constant as a function of wavelength , the observed stokes parameters @xmath73 may be written as @xmath74 where @xmath56 is the wavelength , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the magnitudes of polarization of the component intrinsic to the nova and the isp component , respectively .",
    "@xmath76 is found to be well represented by an empirical function of wavelength : @xmath77 \\mbox { , } \\label{eqn_serkowski}\\ ] ] where the maximum isp , @xmath78 , occurs at the wavelength @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] demonstrate the observed polarization spectra .",
    "a distinct polarization displacement occurred between 25 d and 27 d ; the magnitude of polarization decreased by @xmath50@xmath80 % and the pa rotated by @xmath81@xmath82 in the continuum light at 45008500  .",
    "a clear depolarization effect across the h@xmath2 emission line was also seen on 25 d. nlte line emission is generally formed in the outer ionized region and is subject to smaller thomson scattering optical depth compared to the continuum light from the embedded central star .",
    "this leads to a lower polarization of line emission than that of neighboring continuum light @xcite .",
    "therefore , the depolarization effect provides us with evidence that the continuum light on 25 d was intrinsically polarized .",
    "however , the continuum polarization remained almost constant from 27 d through 36 d. in this period the polarization spectra could be represented by a smooth curve , gradually decreasing with wavelength , and the pa was almost constant around @xmath83 .",
    "there was no clear line polarization effect across the h@xmath2 line on 27 and 28 d. these results suggest that the steady continuum polarization component predominantly represents the isp .    here",
    "we adopt three methods to estimate the isp toward v475 sct .",
    "one is to derive the almost invariable continuum polarization on 2736 d ( method 1 ) , the second is to average the observed polarization in the h@xmath2 line band on 2528 d ( method2 ) , and the third is to subtract the continuum component from the result of method2 and to derive the polarization component of the pure h@xmath2 line emission ( method 3 ) .    for method 1 , we obtained the following isp parameters by a nonlinear regression of equation ( [ eqn_serkowski ] ) for the polarimetric data on 2736 d : @xmath84 % , @xmath85   and @xmath86 . in this calculation",
    ", we neglect the h@xmath2 line region ( see method 2 ) because the possibility of contamination due to the intrinsic polarization component ( as seen on 36 d ) can not be ruled out .    for method 2",
    ", we adopted the wavelength region from 6490 to 6660   as the h@xmath2 line band and vectorially averaged the observed polarization . in this method , although the derived polarization is still contaminated by the continuum component , we can neglect it because the emission line flux is much higher than the continuum flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the derived daily values at h@xmath2 on three nights are shown in the upper part of table [ tbl-2 ] , along with their @xmath87-weighted - mean values .    for method 3",
    ", we adopted the same wavelength region for h@xmath2 line band as in method 2 . in subtracting the continuum component from the line band data , we used two wavelength regions on both sides of the line , each of 200   width , in which no significant polarization feature is seen .",
    "the derived line emission components are shown in the lower part of table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we obtained @xmath88 % and @xmath89 % using method 2 and 3 , respectively , assuming that @xmath79 takes the same value as that of method 1 .",
    "the derived isp parameters are summarized in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "there is no significant difference between the results derived using the three different methods , and we will refer to the results of method 1 and 3 in the following discussion .",
    "( method 2 gives values that are intermediate between those of methods 1 and 3 . )",
    "the derived isp components are plotted in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "they show that both isp curves well trace the continuum polarization on 2736 d and also the h@xmath2 line polarization on 2528 d. in figure [ fig2 ] the magnitude of polarization at a data point close to the h@xmath2 line core on 25 d is somewhat ( @xmath90 ) lower than the isp curves , but we consider the difference at this bin to be insignificant because the width of the bin , @xmath91  , is considerably narrower than the wavelength resolution ( see also table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a map of the polarization of the field stars around v475 sct @xcite . since the distance toward v475 sct has been estimated to be @xmath92 kpc @xcite , we selected field stars at 37 kpc .",
    "generally we can use the field star technique only when we know the distance toward the target star with a substantial accuracy and also have either a field star containing no intrinsic polarization or plenty of field stars to cancel out their intrinsic components by averaging . in the present case , the error of the distance estimation for v475 sct is somewhat large and we have only a few sample stars close to the target in 3d space .",
    "we thus use the map only for a rough check .",
    "the three closest stars ( hd 173987 , hd 170716 , and hd 173694 ) are unlikely to have substantial intrinsic polarization because they do not have emission lines ( although they are all supergiants and may exhibit small variability ) . although v475 sct shows an unusually small ratio @xmath78(%)@xmath93 compared with typical values for the galactic interstellar medium ( @xmath94@xmath95 ; figure 9 of @xcite ) , its ratio is nearly consistent with those of the nearest three stars , @xmath96@xmath97 .",
    "this is likely to be because random components are predominant for the galactic magnetic fields projected to the plane of sky in this direction , @xmath98 ( related with the direction of the cygnus - orion spiral arm ; @xcite ) and the polarizing efficiency against the color excess is remarkably low .",
    "however , when we choose two stars ( hd 173987 and hd 173694 ) from the viewpoint of proximity in both angular and radial distances , the isp component of v475 sct seems roughly consistent with the isp pattern inferred from those of the two stars .",
    "we therefore adopted the derived isp parameters , and calculated the polarization component intrinsic to the nova using equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) .      in figure [ fig6 ] , we plot the intrinsic polarization around the h@xmath2 line on 25 and 36 d. there is no significant difference between the results of methods 13 for estimating the isp . in the polarization data at 25 d",
    "we can see a ` pure ' depolarization effect across the h@xmath2 emission line , in which the pa is almost constant against wavelength .",
    "the small polarization of the h@xmath2 line emission on 25 d ( @xmath99@xmath100 % ) should still be affected by the intrinsic continuum polarization .",
    "in contrast , the polarization spectrum taken on 36 d indicates that the h@xmath2 line emission is clearly polarized both at the line core and the wing component , although the continuum light is not strongly polarized .",
    "two distinct properties of the emission line can be seen in figure [ fig6 ] : ( 1 ) the polarized flux ( @xmath101 total flux ) on 36 d has a broad red wing component , which corresponds to the broad bump around @xmath102   in the @xmath103 spectrum , and ( 2 ) the pa of the wing polarization is well aligned , with @xmath6 , from the center wavelength of h@xmath2 through the red edge of the wing @xmath104  . since all the other lines , including d and [ ] , were too weak to be measured polarimetrically , we mainly discuss the h@xmath2 line polarization in what follows .",
    "is the red wing component really associated with the h@xmath2 emission ?",
    "no other strong emission line near 6640   is known for typical novae at similar epochs , so that the red wing component could not be superimposed by another emission line .",
    "in addition , the pa of the intrinsic polarization is almost constant throughout the broad bump feature , including the h@xmath2 line core .",
    "we therefore consider that the wing component is in fact associated with the h@xmath2 line emission .",
    "this polarized red wing component is naturally explained if a high - velocity collimated outflow is present near the h@xmath2 line emitting region at pa@xmath105 and/or @xmath106 on the projected sky .",
    "if free electrons in a receding wind scatter a substantial amount of light emitted from the inner ( i.e. , lower velocity ) region , the observed polarized flux will have a redshifted component , owing to contributions from both scattered and unscattered ( i.e. , direct ) light from the inner region ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the flux scattered by a single wind is redshifted by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the velocity of the wind and @xmath109 is the inclination angle of the wind direction against the line of sight measured from the far side of the nova .",
    "it should be noted that the flux scattered by a receding wind is always shifted redward @xmath110 and that little or no polarization is expected for @xmath111 or @xmath112 , as the scattering angle is nearly zero . in a realistic case ,",
    "any wind is more likely to be bipolar rather than to have a single direction of outflow . if we assume a bipolar wind , a double - peaked profile ( with separation @xmath113 ) is expected in the polarization spectrum . in figure",
    "[ fig6]b we find only a single broad peak around 6640   ( corresponding to @xmath114 km s@xmath4 ) that extends up to 6670   ( @xmath115 km",
    "s@xmath4 ) from the constancy of @xmath116 .",
    "this is consistent with a model in which the bipolar axis is approximately perpendicular to the line of sight ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath108 would be approximately equal to @xmath118 from equation ( [ eqn_redwing ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the single peak can be explained for any @xmath109 if we assume that one of the two scattered light components suffers from selective extinction ( e.g. , more absorption is expected for light scattered by the far - side wind component ) . in this case",
    "@xmath118 would indicate a lower limit on the real wind velocity , @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude that the h@xmath2 wing polarization is more likely produced by scattering by a bipolar nova wind with a velocity of @xmath119 km s@xmath4 or higher . to our knowledge",
    ", such a high - velocity outflow has never been observed in moderately fast novae .",
    "this fact does not directly indicate that v475 sct belongs to a peculiar category of novae .",
    "rather , it is plausible that many past observations lacked the ability to detect such high - velocity outflows because of lower spectral resolution , insufficient time coverage , and/or lack of measurements of polarization properties .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] indicates the existence of significant continuum polarization ( @xmath80@xmath9 % ) on 25 d. one can see that this continuum polarization extends over 45008400   with a similar magnitude and pa of polarization , although figure [ fig6 ] shows only a wavelength region near h@xmath2 .",
    "the intrinsic continuum polarization indicates that the asymmetric geometry was clearly present on 25 d. however , the polarization disappeared within the next 2 d. thus , the continuum polarization component was not persistent but temporary , requiring a time - variable asymmetrical circumstellar geometry .",
    "we propose a plasma blob ejection as the most likely source of the temporary polarization . assuming that the plasma blob ejection occurred just before 25 d",
    ", the blob would still be near the pseudo - photosphere and would not be outside of the expanding ionized shell .",
    "such a blob would contribute effectively to the polarization of the continuum light from the pseudo - photosphere .",
    "the similarity of the measured pa for the continuum polarization on 25 d and the wing polarization on 36 d suggests a persistence of the asymmetric geometry during this period .",
    "this scenario seems consistent with the polarimetric variability found in novae v1974 cyg and v1494 aql in outburst phase ; in these systems , the principal geometry of the nova wind remained nearly constant throughout the early decline phase , while clumpy mass ejection became conspicuous in the later phase @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear whether the plasma blob causing the continuum polarization on 25 d also had a high velocity .",
    "future high - spatial - resolution imaging of the remnant of v475 sct may give clues to the validity of this scenario .",
    "our observations suggest that a violent mass - loss mechanism may exist even in a moderately fast nova .",
    "evidence of high - velocity outflows ( @xmath120 km s@xmath4 ) has been reported for some recurrent novae , u sco , ci aql , and rs oph @xcite , and also for onemg classical novae , v838 her , v1974 cyg , v382 vel and v1187 sco @xcite .",
    "those observations have shown that the peak expansion velocity is usually recorded near maximum light and that the velocity decreases as the optical light fades .",
    "it is likely that in these systems the outer shell is considerably accelerated directly after the initial ejection .",
    "this situation seems clearly different from that of typical classical novae , in which the expansion velocity gradually increases after maximum light , and later spectral systems of novae generally show higher expansion velocities @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be better to discuss the wind of v475 sct separately from the high - velocity outflows found in recurrent novae and onemg novae ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    among normal classical novae (= cno novae ) , only novae belonging to the ` very fast ' speed class ( @xmath121 d ) have shown high - velocity winds , e.g. , @xmath122 km s@xmath4 in v1500 cyg ( @xmath123 d ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is empirically known that the expansion velocity of a classical nova becomes higher as @xmath24 is shorter , which has been explained in terms of the equipartition of energy between the radiation field and the ejected matter @xcite .",
    "optically thick wind calculations have shown that the nova lightcurve and maximum wind velocity depend primarily on the white dwarf mass , @xmath124 , and are less sensitive to the abundance ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in the sense that a more massive white dwarf usually shows a more rapid decline in a nova outburst . however , even for the cases with the most massive white dwarfs , spherically symmetric models can not well reproduce photospheric velocities of more than @xmath125 km s@xmath4",
    ". calculations of nova evolutionary sequences have also given similar results @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , however , evidence for nonspherical ejecta have been found in many novae .",
    "@xcite applied an asymmetric jet - shaped outflow in their steady - state mass - loss model and successfully reproduced the high - velocity outflows with speeds up to @xmath126 km s@xmath4 found in u sco near maximum light .",
    "they suggested that the terminal velocity of the outflow is sensitive only to the white dwarf mass , as in the spherically symmetric models , and that neither the composition nor the opening angle of the jetlike outflow has a strong effect on the velocity .",
    "the white dwarf mass of u sco is estimated to be @xmath127 m@xmath128 @xcite , which is higher than those of moderately fast or slower class novae ( @xmath129 m@xmath128 , @xcite ) . for @xmath129 m@xmath128 cases ,",

    ", @xcite derived @xmath130 m@xmath128 using their photometric data along with the formula given by @xcite .",
    "the existence of a steady high - velocity wind of @xmath131 km s@xmath4 is still unusual for a moderately fast nova without any additional acceleration source .",
    "we now briefly consider the possibility of a non - static activity in a nova system within the framework of astronomical jets .",
    "high - velocity asymmetric outflows are found in various astronomical objects , such as t tauri stars , x - ray binaries , and active galactic nuclei .",
    "@xcite reviewed past studies on jets and discussed the possibility that all types of objects accompanied with jets possess accretion disks .",
    "it has been known that some mass - accreting white dwarf systems , such as supersoft x - ray sources and symbiotic stars , exhibit evidence of jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , no convincing evidence of jets has been found so far for classical and dwarf novae , although the configuration of the binary system is similar to those of supersoft x - ray sources and symbiotic stars .",
    "@xcite applied their jet - launching thermal model with an accretion disk to the cataclysmic binaries and suggested that a mass - accretion rate @xmath132 m@xmath128 yr@xmath4 is required for the formation of a shock and subsequent mass ejection .",
    "their result explains why jets have not been observed in classical and dwarf novae ( @xmath133 m@xmath128 yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "however , @xcite recently found a transient high velocity component ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 km s@xmath4 ) in the transition phase of a very fast nova v1494 aql 104 d after the light maximum .",
    "@xcite discussed this component together with the x - ray activity found in the nova ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and suggested that the existence of jets is expected for classical novae , owing to a possible temporary increase of the mass - accretion rate up to @xmath136 m@xmath128 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this scenario requires the existence of an accretion disk around the white dwarf .",
    "although it is not well - known when the accretion disk is reestablished after its probable destruction during the nova outburst , some indirect evidence for the presence of accretion disks has been found for some novae a few months or years after the outburst @xcite .",
    "however , for a moderately fast nova ( @xmath129 m@xmath128 ) both the white dwarf and the secondary ( assuming a typical binary separation of @xmath137 cm ) seem to be still deeply engulfed by the photosphere @xmath138 d after the outburst ( figure 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is not likely that the accretion of mass from the secondary has resumed by 36 d in the case of v475 sct .",
    "therefore , at the present time , we do not have any plausible explanation for the ejection of the inferred high - velocity component . in order to establish a realistic model ,",
    "we need further spectropolarimetric observations and need to establish how the continuum and line polarization components evolve during the outburst phase of novae . simultaneous radio or x - ray monitoring would be useful to find evidence for high - energy events around the central star , which might give rise to high - velocity ejecta .",
    "we have presented low- and medium - dispersion spectropolarimetry of a classical nova v475 sct at four epochs in its early decline phase .",
    "we estimated the isp component and subtracted it from the observed polarization .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the low - dispersion spectropolarimetry revealed that the continuum light over most of the observed wavelength range was intrinsically polarized by @xmath139 % on 2003 september 26 ut ( 25 d ) .",
    "this polarization component almost disappeared in the next 2 d , requiring a time - variable asymmetric circumstellar geometry .",
    "the medium - dispersion spectropolarimetry on october 7 ut ( 36 d ) detected an intrinsic polarization component across the h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "this suggests the existence of a wind with speeds of @xmath7 km s@xmath4 or higher .",
    "such a fast wind has never been reported in moderately fast novae .",
    "it is hard to explain how the wind was formed within the current framework of nova winds or jets .",
    "the pas of the above two polarization components were similar to each other , @xmath140@xmath141 .",
    "this suggests that the matter giving rise to scattering in the two cases may have been ejected in a similar asymmetric geometry .",
    "we are grateful to staff members at okayama astrophysical observatory for their kind support .",
    "we also thank members of the focas team and staff members at subaru telescope for the opportunity of the observation .",
    "data reduction / analysis was in part carried out on the `` sb '' computer system operated by the astronomical data analysis center ( adac ) and subaru telescope of naoj .",
