    "the dissipative evolution of a system @xmath0 immersed in a noisy environment @xmath1 can be described via dynamical semigroups of linear maps @xmath2 , acting on density matrices @xmath3 representing the states of the system .",
    "this reduced dynamics for @xmath0 alone is obtained from the unitary time evolution of the full system @xmath4 by tracing over the environment degrees of freedom and by further adopting a markovian ( _ i.e. _ memoryless ) approximation .",
    "this procedure is physically justified when the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is weak and it has been successfully used in many phenomenological applications in quantum chemistry , quantum optics and atomic physics [ 1 - 12 ] .    nevertheless , the derivation of such reduced dynamics from the microscopic subsystem - environment interaction is often based on _ ad hoc _ , simplifying assumptions . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting reduced time evolutions are of bloch - redfield type [ 7 , 8 , 5 ] and therefore might not be fully consistent : typically , such naive dynamics do not preserve the positivity of the @xmath0 density matrix .. ]    in order to cure these inconsistencies , the general attitude is to restrict the action of the non - positive dynamics to a subset of all possible initial density matrices , a procedure sometimes referred to as `` slippage of the initial conditions '' [ 13 - 16 ] .",
    "physically , this prescription is ascribed to the short - time correlations in the environment , that are usually neglected in the derivation of the markovian limit .    in the following",
    ", we shall critically examine this prescription to cure inconsistencies produced by non - positive , markovian evolutions and point out potential problems of this approach , in particular in presence of entanglement .",
    "more specifically , we shall study the behaviour of two subsystems , one immersed in the environment and evolving with a redfield type dissipative dynamics , while the other does not evolve at all .",
    "we shall see that when the initial state of the two subsystems is entangled , the `` slippage '' prescription does not cure all possible inconsistencies of the two - subsystem dynamics .",
    "preliminary , partial results on this line of investigation have been reported in refs.[17 - 19 ] .",
    "in particular , in ref.[18 ] the non - positive , dissipative evolution has been chosen in an _ ad hoc _ and rather abstract way in order to expose the just mentioned difficulties . here , as reduced dynamics we adopt instead a redfield non - positive evolution @xmath2 that has been used in various phenomenological applications [ 7 - 12 ] . with the help of both analytic and numerical methods",
    ", we shall then analyze the fate of the quantum correlations of two qubit systems when they evolve with a factorized dynamics @xmath5 : the `` slippage '' prescription is at work for the first qubit , while the other is inert and evolves with the identity operator .",
    "we shall explicitly show that in such a situation the purely local evolution @xmath5 can increase the entanglement of the two systems , a clearly unphysical result .",
    "therefore in presence of entanglement , the above mentioned prescription of restricting initial conditions to cure non - positive , markovian dynamics does not seem completely satisfactory .",
    "we shall first study the dynamics of a single subsystem immersed in an external environment .",
    "as explained in the introductory remarks , the physical system we shall consider is a two - level system ( qubit ) immersed in a thermal bath . the system is described by @xmath6 density matrices @xmath3 , _ i.e. _ by positive hermitian operators , with unit trace . on the other hand ,",
    "the bath is modeled as an infinite dimensional reservoir in equilibrium at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "being infinitely large , the environment can be considered unaffected by the interaction with the subsystem and therefore to be in the reference equilibrium state @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian describing the free dynamics of the bath .",
    "the total hamiltonian describing the evolution of the compound system can be chosen as [ 8 , 14 - 16 ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 are respectively the subsystem hamiltonian and interaction term , the parameter @xmath12 playing the role of an adimensional coupling constant ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the pauli matrices and represent the subsystem operators , while @xmath15 is an environment operator , taken for simplicity to satisfy the condition @xmath16 .    using standard second order approximation in the coupling constant @xmath12 and",
    "a _ naive _ markovian limit , one finds that the time evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath3 for the system @xmath0 is generated by a master equation of bloch - redfield type that takes the explicit form [ 7 - 9 , 5 ] : @xmath17 + l[\\rho(t)]\\ . \\label{4}\\ ] ] besides the standard hamiltonian piece , the r.h.s . contains the extra contribution @xmath18 , a linear map representing the effects of noise induced by the presence of the external bath . by setting , @xmath19 and further introducing the environment two - point correlation functions , @xmath20={\\rm tr}\\big[\\rho_e b b(-t)\\big]\\ , \\label{6}\\ ] ] it",

    "indeed , since @xmath23 is a thermal state , it obeys the so called _ kubo - martin - schwinger condition _",
    "@xcite : @xmath24 as a consequence , the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 above obey the following relation : @xmath27 further , one can show that the coefficient @xmath25 must be positive [ 5 ] .",

    "unfortunately , this evolution does not preserve the positivity of the eigenvalues of @xmath3 for all times . in order to show this ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider the following initial state @xmath33 with entries : @xmath34 it is a pure state , since @xmath35=\\,0 $ ] . to have a @xmath33 with positive spectrum",

    "on the other hand , using ( [ 13 ] ) , one easily sees that : @xmath38 a zero value being allowed only when @xmath39 .",
    "further , note that because of the kms condition ( [ 10 ] ) , even if @xmath40 , a vanishing @xmath26 can be obtained only at infinite temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath41 .",
    "it thus follows that at finite temperature the markov approximation leading to the master equation ( [ 4 ] ) , with generator as in ( [ 7 ] ) , does not preserve positivity , since a state like @xmath33 is immediately turned into a matrix with negative eigenvalues as soon as @xmath37 .",
    "although unphysical , the time evolution ( [ 12 ] ) generated by ( [ 4 ] ) is nevertheless used in phenomenological applications because of its good asymptotic behaviour .",
    "in fact , it possesses a unique equilibrium state @xmath42 , that can be easily determined by setting to zero the r.h.s . of ( [ 4 ] ) : @xmath43}\\ .",
    "\\label{15}\\ ] ] therefore , it turns out that for asymptotically long times the system is driven to a thermal state at the bath temperature , a behaviour which is physically expected in such open quantum systems .    in order to adopt the redfield dynamics given in ( [ 12 ] ) as a _",
    "bona fide _ time evolution , a cure to the non - positivity needs to be introduced .",
    "the general solution that has been proposed is to restrict the space of initial conditions to those states @xmath44 that remain positive under the action of the redfield dynamics .",
    "the general argument supporting this choice is that any markovian approximation neglects a certain initial span of time , the transient , during which memory effects can not be ignored . during this short transient time",
    ", the environment acts in a very complicated way on the subsystem and the net result is the elimination of all states , like @xmath33 in ( [ 13 ] ) , that would give rise to inconsistencies during the subsequent markovian regime .",
    "this mechanism is known in the literature as `` slippage of initial conditions '' [ 13 - 16 ] . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "this prescription may cure the positivity preserving problem for a single subsystem , but appears to be inconclusive when dealing with bi- or multi - partite open systems in view of the existence of entangled states .",
    "we shall now extend the treatment discussed so far to the case of two qubits , one of which is still immersed in a heat bath and therefore evolves with the dissipative dynamics @xmath2 generated by the redfield equations ( [ 4 ] ) , while the other remains inert ( it is usually called an _ ancilla _ ) .",
    "the total time evolution for the two qubits is then in factorized form , @xmath5 , where `` i d '' is the identity operator acting on the second qubit . in order to have a consistent time evolution",
    ", we shall further assume the `` slippage prescription '' at work for the first qubit : we remark that this prescription originates in the action of the bath during the transient and therefore can only involve the qubit inside the bath , and not the ancilla .    within this framework",
    ", we shall explicitly show the existence of states for the two qubits that 1 ) when traced over the ancilla degrees of freedom , belong to the set of admissible initial states for the non - positive dynamics @xmath2 , 2 ) remain positive under the action of the extended dynamics @xmath5 and 3 ) nevertheless present an increase of their entanglement .",
    "this is clearly an unphysical result , because the evolution map acts locally , _",
    "i.e. _ in a separate form , and therefore can not create quantum correlations .",
    "the existence of such states implies that the `` slippage prescription '' should take care not only of single system states developing negative eigenvalues , but also of possible inconsistencies related to the entanglement of these systems with any other ancilla .    in order to explicitly expose this inconsistency",
    ", it will be sufficient to work within a special class of two - qubit density matrices , those for which the non - vanishing entries lie along the two diagonals : @xmath45 further restrictions on the entries of this matrix need to be imposed in order to represent a state .",
    "in particular , the trace must be one , @xmath46 , while the positivity of the spectrum implies the positivity of the two subdeterminants and and of the entries along the diagonal .",
    "the form ( [ 16 ] ) is particularly suited for our considerations since it is preserved by the action of the dynamics @xmath47 ; further , its entanglement content can be explicitly calculated .    in this respect , a convenient measure of entanglement is provided by concurrence : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath50 taken in decreasing order ; it vanishes for a separable state while takes positive values between zero and one for entangled states [ 21 , 22 ] . for the state (",
    "[ 16 ] ) , one explicitly finds : @xmath51 it is then clear that the state ( [ 16 ] ) is entangled provided @xmath52,@xmath53 . for simplicity , in the following",
    "we shall assume to start at @xmath36 with an entangled state @xmath44 fulfilling the more restrictive condition @xmath54 .",
    "let us then consider the following two - parameter family of states @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are real constants satisfying the three constraints ( necessary for positivity ) @xmath58 with @xmath59 . in writing (",
    "[ 20 ] ) , we have assumed @xmath60 ; this is not really restrictive since for @xmath61 a similar family of states can be found .",

    "we have taken @xmath63 , since this allows certain simplifications in the calculations . ]    however , these states present another , more subtle inconsistency than non - positivity . indeed , using numerical methods",
    ", one can show that their concurrence increases for small times . the picture below displays the behaviour of the concurrence of one of these states as a function of time .",

    "it shows an oscillatory behaviour that is in clear contradiction with quantum mechanics , since the dynamics is in factorized form .",

    "it is widely believed that the dynamics of a subsystem in weak interaction with an external environment can be described in terms of semigroups of linear maps @xmath2 generated by a markovian master equation . in order to be physically acceptable",
    ", this effective description needs to satisfy basic physical requirements . in the first place",
    ", it must preserve the positivity of any initial density matrix , since their eigenvelues represent probabilities . in the second place",

    "unfortunately , most phenomenological derivation of reduced dissipative dynamics lead to semigroups of linear transformation that are not positive . to avoid inconsistencies ,",
    "one usually restricts the possible initial states to those for which @xmath2 remains positive ( the so - called `` slippage of initial conditions '' ) .",

    "indeed , we have found explicit examples of two - qubit states which under the action of @xmath47 present an increasing concurrence .",
    "the creation of entanglement by a local operation is clearly unacceptable on physical grounds .",
    "this means that the `` slipped '' dynamics is still not free from inconsistencies .    as a consequence , in order to continue to use non - positive reduced dynamics of redfield type , a new , more general `` slippage '' mechanism should be invoked : it must take care not only of states developing negative eigenvalues but also of those presenting unphysical increase in entanglement . the only way to practically implement it is by further restricting the space of initial admissible states , discarding also some entangled ones .",
    "it should be noticed that possible inconsistencies are not limited to the two - qubits case ; by considering more complicated ancillary coupling similar problems may arise for multipartite entangled states that should therefore also be eliminated by the `` slippage operation '' .",
    "the risk of such a mechanism is to restrict too much the space of states , losing , in particular , many entangled states .",
    "these considerations seems to suggest that there is an intrinsic incompatibility between the existence of entangled states and the slippage prescription adopted to cure the inconsistencies that non - positive , reduced dynamics might produce .    in closing , let us mention that in the few cases for which the markovian limit of the subdynamics can be obtained in a rigorous way , the resulting evolution map @xmath2 turns out to be not only positive , but also completely positive [ 1 - 6 ] . in these cases ,",
    "the compound map @xmath47 is also completely positive and therefore no inconsistencies can arise , even when acting on entangled states ."
