    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) could appear in various new physics scenarios beyond the standard model , e.g. , in the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm )  @xcite , in grand unified theories  @xcite , and see - saw mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "in most models describing lfv in the @xmath5 lepton sector , the radiative decays @xmath6 have the largest probability ; this has motivated many experimental searches  @xcite .",
    "using 86 fb@xmath7  of data recorded at the @xmath8 resonance with the belle experiment  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath9 collider  @xcite we have previously obtained the upper limits @xmath10  @xcite and @xmath11  @xcite at the 90% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "the babar collaboration subsequently obtained the upper limits @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite with 232.2 fb@xmath7  of data . here , we report on an updated analysis with 535 fb@xmath7  of data , which corresponds to @xmath14 produced @xmath15 pairs  @xcite .    the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field . an iron flux - return located outside",
    "the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath16 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the basic analysis procedure is similar to our previous one @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria for @xmath17 are determined and optimized by examining monte carlo ( mc ) simulated signal and background ( bg ) events , including generic @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 , bhabha , @xmath21 , and two - photon events .",
    "the bg @xmath22 events are generated by the kkmc / tauola  @xcite and the response of the belle detector is simulated by the geant3  @xcite based program .",
    "photon candidates are selected from ecl clusters that are consistent with an electromagnetic shower shape and not associated with charged tracks .",
    "muon candidates are identified by using a muon likelihood ratio , @xmath23  @xcite , which is based on the difference between the range of the track calculated from the particle momentum and that measured by the klm .",
    "this ratio includes the value of @xmath24 formed from the klm hit locations with respect to the extrapolated track .",
    "the muon identification efficiency for these selection criteria ( @xmath25 ) is 90% , with a pion fake probability of 0.8% .",
    "identification of electrons uses an electron likelihood ratio , @xmath26 , based on @xmath27 information from the cdc , the ratio of the energy deposited in the ecl to the momentum measured by the cdc and svd , the shower shape in the ecl , hit information from the acc and matching between the positions of the charged track and the ecl cluster  @xcite .",
    "the electron identification efficiency for these selection criteria ( @xmath28 ) is 95% , with a pion fake probability of 0.07% .",
    "we select events that include exactly two oppositely charged tracks and at least one photon , consistent with @xmath15 decays : one @xmath30 ( signal side ) decays to @xmath31 and the other ( tag side ) decays to a charged particle that is not a muon ( denoted hereafter as @xmath32 ) , neutrino(s ) and any number of photons . in this analysis , before particle identification , we assign the pion mass to all charged tracks to calculate their energies and momenta in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame .",
    "each track must have a momentum @xmath33 4.5 gev/@xmath34 in the cm frame to reduce contamination from bhabha and @xmath35 events and a transverse component to the beam axis of @xmath36 0.1 gev/@xmath34 within the detector fiducial region , @xmath37 , to suppress two - photon background .",
    "here @xmath38 is the polar angle with respect to the @xmath39 axis , which is anti - parallel to the @xmath40 beam .",
    "( hereafter , all the variables defined in the cm frame have superscripts `` cm '' . )",
    "each photon is required to have an energy @xmath41 gev within the fiducial region .",
    "the total energy in the cm frame must be @xmath42 gev to further suppress bhabha and @xmath21 events .",
    "the magnitude of the thrust vector , constructed from all selected charged tracks and photons mentioned above , is required to be in the range from 0.90 to 0.98 in order to suppress @xmath21 and @xmath19 background ( fig .  [ cutmg](a ) ) .    for muon identification",
    ", we require a likelihood ratio of @xmath43 0.95 and @xmath44 1.0  gev/@xmath34 . on the tag side ,",
    "a track with @xmath45 0.8 is defined as @xmath32 .",
    "the photon that forms a @xmath46 candidate is required to have @xmath47 0.5 gev and @xmath48 to remove any spurious combinations of @xmath49 s .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      after opening the blind we find 13 and 55 data events in the blinded region and @xmath50 region , respectively , while the mc predicts @xmath51 and @xmath52 events , respectively .",
    "figure  [ 2d_eg](a ) shows the event distribution in the @xmath53@xmath54 plane .",
    "the signal extraction process is the same as that for @xmath55 , described in the former section .",
    "the bg is composed of @xmath56 @xmath57 ( radiative bhabha ) , while the remainder is @xmath58 .",
    "no other background source is found in mc .",
    "the ueml fit over the @xmath59 ellipse region results in @xmath60 , @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the toy mc gives a probability of 48% to obtain @xmath63 in the case of a null signal .",
    "figure  [ 2d_eg](b ) is the same as fig .",
    "[ 2d_mg](b ) , but for the @xmath64 case .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath65 is obtained by the toy mc in the case of the ueml fit result .",
    "the upper limit on the branching ratio is calculated as @xmath66 where the detection efficiency for the @xmath67 ellipse region is @xmath68 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for the bg pdf shape increase @xmath69 to 3.4 .",
    "the other systematic uncertainties are similar to those for @xmath55 ; minor differences are in the selection criteria ( 2.5% ) and the trigger efficiency ( 2.0% ) .",
    "the total uncertainty is 4.5% , and it increases the upper limit on the branching ratio by 0.2% . taking into account this systematic error , we obtain the 90% cl upper limit , @xmath70",
    "we have updated our searches for the lfv decay modes , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , using 535 fb@xmath2 of data , corresponding to about six times higher statistics than in the previous publication  @xcite . in this study , we have introduced four new requirements for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the magnitude of the thrust vector in the @xmath29 search and three new requirements for @xmath74 , @xmath76 and the magnitude of the thrust vector in the @xmath77 search . as a result of the optimized selection criteria , we obtain @xmath78% and @xmath79 events in the @xmath59 elliptical signal region for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) in this analysis , compared to @xmath82% and @xmath83 events over a @xmath84 signal box in our previous study .",
    "the improved selection leads to a value of @xmath85 that is almost the same as that in the previous analysis , and therefore the expected upper limit , which is approximately proportional to @xmath86 in the case of no signal , has improved as @xmath87 rather than in proportion to @xmath88 , as would be the case if the previous selection criteria were used .",
    "( here @xmath89 is the integrated luminosity . )",
    "the resulting upper limits on the branching ratios are @xmath90 at the 90% cl .",
    "+ the limit on the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay is the most stringent among all lfv decays of the @xmath5 lepton to date .",
    "our results constrain the parameter space of various theoretical models that predict lfv decays  @xcite .",
