    "these stability windows tend to become broader and broader until for sufficiently large  @xmath0 chaos seems to disappear and one type of stable periodic solution takes over .    of the numerous studies of the lorenz model we cite as examples the monograph  @xcite and the more recent survey in jackson s book  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the parameter dependence of the lorenz model has mainly been analyzed with respect to its control parameter  @xmath0 , the external forcing , and sometimes with varying  @xmath25 ( as in the work  @xcite which is cited in  @xcite ) .",

    "this motivated us to vary  @xmath1 in sufficiently small steps and study the 2-dimensional @xmath57-space of control parameters in a larger domain than has hitherto been done .",
    "however , quite apart from such a physical motivation , the mathematical complexity of this innocent looking set of equations warrants an investigation of their asymptotic behavior where it has not yet been explored .    in section  [ sec : two ] we present our parameter survey ( phase diagrams ) and discuss its main features .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : attractors ] the nature of two kinds of periodic orbits is described whose stability regions define the dominant regular features of the large scale phase diagram ; an analytic derivation of these observations is given in section  [ secparameterspace ] .",
    "more complex aspects of the lorenz dynamics such as bifurcations of periodic orbits , chaos , and coexistence of attractors , are discussed in section  [ secbifs ] .",
