    "the three year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe observations ( wmap3)@xcite have made so far the most precise probe on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiations . in the fittings to a constant equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy ( de ) @xmath3 , combinations of wmap with other cosmological observations are in remarkable agreement with a cosmological constant ( cc ) except for the wmap @xmath0 sdss combination , where @xmath4 is favored a bit more than 1@xmath5@xcite .",
    "the measurements of the sdss power spectrum@xcite in some sense make the most precise probe of the current linear galaxy matter power spectrum and will hopefully get significantly improved within the coming few years .",
    "if the preference of @xmath4 holds on with the accumulation of cosmological observations this will also help significantly on our understandings towards dark energy .",
    "a cosmological constant , which is theoretically problematic at present@xcite , will not be the source driving the current accelerated expansion and a preferred candidate would be something like quintessence@xcite . on the other hand , the observations from the type ia supernova ( snia ) in some sense make the only direct detection of dark energy@xcite and currently a combination of wmap @xmath0 snia or cmb @xmath0 snia @xmath0 lss are well consistent with the cosmological constant and the preference of a quintessence - like equation state has disappeared@xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the combinations with the lyman @xmath6 forest ref.@xcite shows that a constant eos @xmath7 is preferred slightly .",
    "moreover when one considers the observational imprints by dynamical equation of state , an eos which gets across @xmath1 is mildly favored by the current observations@xcite .",
    "intriguingly , we are also aware that the predictions for the luminosity distance - redshift relationship from the @xmath8cdm model by wmap only are in notable discrepancies with the `` gold '' samples reported by riess @xmath9 @xmath10@xcite . although the discrepancy might be due to some systematical uncertainties in the riess `` gold '' sample@xcite , this needs to be confronted with the accumulation of the 5-year snls observations@xcite and the ongoing snia projects like the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) and from the supernova search team ( sst ) .",
    "alternatively , this might be due to the implications of dynamical dark energy with oscillating equation of state .",
    "although the temperature - temperature correlation ( tt ) power of wmap3 is now cosmic variance limited up to @xmath11 and the third peak is now detected , the tentative features as discovered by the first year wmap@xcite are still present : the low tt quadrupole and localized oscillating features on tt for @xmath12@xcite . although the signatures of glitches on the first peak as discovered by the first year wmap have now become weak , they do exist and go beyond the limited cosmic variance@xcite . while for the low wmap tt quadrupole many authors are inclined to attribute it to cutoff primordial spectrum@xcite , and even before the release of the first year wmap ref .",
    "@xcite claimed oscillating primordial spectrum could lead to oscillations around the first peak of cmb tt power , similar effects _ might _ be due to features on dark energy rather than inflation .",
    "for example , ref.@xcite has attributed the low quadrupole to some subtle physics of dark energy during inflation .    in the literature",
    "there have been many investigations on inflationary models with broken scale invariance@xcite .",
    "such features have been invoked to explain the previously observed feature at @xmath13 mpc@xmath14@xcite , or even to solve the small scale problem of the cdm model @xcite .",
    "moreover ref.@xcite has claimed that the pre - wmap data could not exclude a large running of the spectral index ( for relevant study see also @xcite ) , which has been somewhat dramatically confirmed by the first year wmap and wmap3 in combination with other observations@xcite except for the case with the lyman alpha forest@xcite .",
    "inflation and dark energy , both of which describe the accelerated expansion of the universe , might have some relations and ref.@xcite proposed a new picture of quintessential inflation .",
    "ref.@xcite has made an attempt trying to find such relations from the observational aspect . while oscillating primordial spectrum may be responsible for the glitches on cmb",
    ", oscillating eos of dark energy may be helpful to solve the coincidence problem of dark energy@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite in the framework of quintom@xcite , an attempt was carried out to unify dark energy and inflation , meanwhile solving the coincidence problem of de .    on theoretical aspect dark energy",
    "is among the biggest problem of modern cosmology@xcite .",
    "dynamical dark energy models rather than the simple cosmological constant have attracted more interests in theoretical studies@xcite . in cases where the mysterious component of de is driven by scalar fields@xcite the eos is typically not like that by a cosmological constant , this opens a possibility for us to tell cc from scalar dark energy models with the cosmological observations .",
    "moreover the current observations have already opened a robust window to probe the behavior of dark energy independently , and in cases when @xmath15 is preferred , dynamical de models which satisfy the observations are put forward@xcite .",
    "given the current ambiguity on theoretical study of dark energy , in the observational probe of de one often uses the parametrizations of eos .",
    "previously in the observational probes on oscillating features of dark energy eos ref.@xcite has made some preliminary fittings to the pre - wmap3 data and some relevant studies have been carried out later by refs.@xcite . in the present paper with the method dealing with the perturbations of quintom developed in refs.@xcite , we aim to probe the time dependence of the dark energy eos in light of wmap3 and the combination with other tentative cosmological observations from sdss and snia from the riess `` gold '' sample or the snls observations . the background evolution and perturbations of quintom",
    "can be identified with one normal quintessence and one phantom except for the phantom crossing point , where the natural matching condition is motivated by the case with a high - dimensional operator on the kinetic term or the two - field case and the individual sound speed for each field is assumed to be unity@xcite . in the present work we mainly focus on cases where the eos is oscillating or with local bumps . by performing a global analysis with the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method",
    ", we find the current observations , in particular the wmap3 @xmath0 sdss data combination , allow large oscillations of the eos which can leave oscillating features on the ( residual ) hubble diagram , and such oscillations are potentially detectable by future observations like snap .",
    "local bumps of dark energy eos can also leave imprints on cmb , lss and snia . in cases when the bumps take place at low redshifts and",
    "the effective eos is close to @xmath1 , cmb and lss observations can not give stringent constraints on such possibilities . however , geometrical observations like ( future ) snia can possibly detect such features . on the other hand when the local bumps take place at higher redshifts beyond the detectability of snia , future precise observations like gamma - ray bursts and observations of 21 cm tomography , cmb and lss may possibly detect such features .",
    "in particular , we find that bump - like dark energy eos on high redshifts _ might _ be responsible for the features of wmap on ranges @xmath2 , which is interesting and deserves addressing further .",
    "the remaining part of our paper is structured as follows : in section ii we describe the method and the data ; in section iii we present our results on the determination of cosmological parameters with ( wmap3)@xcite , snia @xcite , sloan digital sky survey 3-d power spectrum ( sdss - p(k ) ) @xcite by global fittings using the mcmc technique ; discussions and conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "in the parametrization of oscillating eos one typically needs four parameters for the amplitude , center values , phase and the frequency . and",
    "in our analysis we have used @xmath16 the case with @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponds to the cosmological constant .",
    "the method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc`@xcite , which has been modified to allow for the inclusion of dark energy perturbations with eos getting across @xmath1@xcite .",

    "we have used the first 14 bins only , which are supposed to be well within the linear regime@xcite . in the calculation of the likelihood from snia we have marginalized over the nuisance parameter@xcite .",
    "the supernova data we use are the `` gold '' set of 157 snia published by riess @xmath9 @xmath10 in @xcite and the 71 high redshift type ia supernova discovered during the first year of the 5-year supernova legacy survey ( snls)@xcite respectively . in the fittings to snls",
    "we have used the additional 44 nearby snia , as also adopted by the snls group@xcite . also to be conservative but more robust , we did not try to combine snls with the riess sample simultaneously for cosmological parameter constraints , namely in one case for snia fitting we use snls data only and in another case the riess sample only . for each regular calculation , we run 6 independent chains comprising of 150,000 - 300,000 chain elements and spend thousands of cpu hours to calculate on a cluster .",

    ", we can not expect to probe such features with even future snap observations . on the other hand as",
    "the current observations are consistent with a @xmath8-like dark energy , typically we can not hope dark energy will be non - negligible in epochs far before the matter - radiation equality epoch , although such a possibility remains ( for relevant studies see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand with our parametrized eos given in eq .",
    "( [ wqbump ] ) we can not expect dark energy component to be significant on very high redshifts , especially for cases where @xmath17 ) , which will not be explored by the current paper . ] .",
    "under such a circumstance we take the locations of bumps to be slightly larger than @xmath91 : in one case @xmath92 and in another case @xmath93 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath94 and 5.0 respectively where @xmath95 .",
    "for both of the cases we have fixed @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in fig.[fig : fig3 ] we show the imprints of bump - like dark energy eos on cmb , lss ( right panels ) , on dark energy density fractions and on the residual hubble diagram ( left panels ) .",
    "the bumps take place at high redshifts which can not be detectable by ( future ) snia observations .",
    "on the other hand , observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) can probe relatively higher redshifts than snia@xcite , with the accumulations of grb events as by swift and better understandings on the systematics one is hopefully able to detect such features through geometric observations on the hubble diagrams .",
    "moreover observations like the 21 cm tomography @xcite are potentially able to give almost a large number of independent samples compared with cmb and lss observations@xcite , features of bump - like dark energy eos on intermediate redshifts are promisingly detected by observations of the 21 cm tomography . in the right panels of fig.[fig : fig3 ] we find dramatically that bump - like features are possibly detectable by cosmic variance limited cmb ( e.g. wmap3@xcite ) and lamost@xcite .",
    "part of the reason lies on the fact that with a different width and a higher redshift compared with the previous example in fig.[fig : fig1 ] , here the energy density fraction @xmath98 increases and decreases rapidly and the magnitude of the peak value of @xmath98 is somewhat lower , the asymmetric shapes of the peak and trough can not compensate thoroughly to give @xmath61 close to @xmath1 .",
    "in fact one can find for our parametrization given in eq .",
    "( [ wqbump ] ) one will typically get @xmath99 and in cases with larger @xmath100 the deviation of @xmath61 from -1 can be larger , which will also lead to some shifts on cmb peaks , as shown in fig.[fig : fig3 ] . it is noteworthy to point out that both the first year wmap and wmap3 show some local glitches out of cosmic variance at @xmath101 . in our case of fig.[fig : fig3 ] there are also some relevant features on such scales and this deserves further investigations . while such features can be affected by different foreground analysis and so forth@xcite , it is theoretically possible that the features of wmap tt on scales @xmath101 are due to some bump - like features of dark energy eos , or some semi - oscillations .",
    "note here we have fixed the background parameters rather than performing a global analysis , and in cases we take into account the parameter degeneracies the detectability of the observations would typically get weaker .",
    "on the other hand we can expect that in the global analysis when all of the parameters ( including the bias factor ) can vary , the observations can give constraints or detect the signatures where the amplitudes of bumps are even higher than the examples listed above .     .",
    "we should point that in all our three data combinations , a large area of oscillating quintom where the eos of dark energy gets across @xmath1 during time evolutions are allowed by the current observations , which is different from the previous case in ref.@xcite and from the case in ref .",
    "moreover contrary to refs.@xcite , oscillating quintom displays the distinctive feature that due to the average effects on the regions of eos where @xmath4 and @xmath7 , the quantity @xmath61 can be very close to @xmath1 . oscillating quintom - like dark energy , where the unification of two epochs of accelerated expansions can be realized and the coincidence problem can be solved@xcite , proves to be a good fit to current cosmology .",
    "we should stress again that resembling the oscillating primordial spectrum case@xcite , the not good enough convergence of oscillating dark energy eos is inevitable in the light of the current observations . in the wmap @xmath0 sdss allowed parameter space",
    "there are areas with significant oscillations , which implies that the currently ongoing snia observations may detect such oscillating or semi - oscillating features on the ( residual ) hubble diagram .",
    "moreover while oscillating features on cmb might be explained by both oscillating primordial spectrum and oscillations in dark energy eos , the oscillating features on the hubble diagram can not be due to features in the primordial spectrum , but by oscillating eos .",
    "local bumps of dark energy eos may leave some distinctive imprints on cmb , lss and snia .",
    "the bumps are potentially detectable by geometrical observations like snia and grb . future observations of 21 cm tomography open a very promising window to detect / exclude such features .",
    "lss measurements like lamost and cosmic variance limited cmb may also detect such features . in particular , bump - like dark energy eos on high redshifts _ might _ be responsible for the features of wmap on ranges @xmath2 , which is interesting and deserves addressing further .    given the fact that currently we know relatively very little on theoretical aspects of dark energy , observing dynamical dark energy is currently the most important aspect of dark energy study .",
    "on the observational probes typically one needs some parametrizations on the form of dark energy eos .",
    "while using some specific forms of parametrizations one often takes the risks of getting biased ( see e.g. @xcite ) , investigations towards unbiased probe of de@xcite in light of all the available cosmological observations still need further developments . on the other hand some of the parametrizations are in some sense well motivated ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and in fittings starting with parametrized eos one typically has larger @xmath102 ( number of data minus the number of parameters ) and hence gets better constraints on dark energy . with the accumulations of observational data",
    "poor parametrizations will get ruled out and in this sense parametrized study of dark energy provides a complementary study of the non - parametric probes . as from any quintessence - like or phantom - like eos which do not get across @xmath1",
    "one can reconstruct the dark energy potential@xcite , any parametrizations of non - quintom - like eos correspond to some specific forms of quintessence / phantom potentials they correspond to quintessence with negative potentials . ] and hence such parametrizations are somewhat well motivated .",
    "bump - like eos which do not get across @xmath1 also correspond to some specific de potentials which can be straightforwardly worked out .",
    "similarly for ( semi-)oscillating eos which do not get across @xmath1 one can work out the corresponding de potentials . in cases with bumps described in eq .",
    "( [ wqbump ] ) and with oscillations in eq .",
    "( [ wqosc ] ) , one can not simply reconstruct the potentials of de due to the distinctive nature of quintom@xcite .",
