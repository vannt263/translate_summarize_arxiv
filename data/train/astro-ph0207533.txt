    "ultra - precise radial velocity ( rv ) surveys have revealed over 100 planetary companions to nearby fgkm main - sequence stars .",
    "the minimum masses @xmath8 and semi - major axes @xmath9 of these companions are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the number of known planetary companions is now reaching the point where robust statistical inferences about trends within the sample can be made , and thus the study of extrasolar planets is in transition from the discovery phase to the characterization phase .",
    "the ` classical ' methods of detecting extrasolar planets ( rv , astrometry , transits , direct detection ) are generally complementary to each other both in the range of semi - major axes @xmath9 they probe ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and in the parameters they measure .",
    "they also generally suffer from the same set of drawbacks .",
    "first , because they rely on light from either the parent star or the planet itself , they are generally limited to nearby systems .",
    "second , they are not currently sensitive to very low - mass planets .",
    "for example , the systematic floor of rv surveys is thought to be @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that earth , uranus , and neptune analogs are probably inaccessible to rv surveys .",
    "finally , they generally require that the system be monitored for at least one full period of the companion .",
    "thus , although rv surveys have been ongoing for over a decade , they are only now becoming sensitive to jupiter - analogs ( marcy et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "microlensing is an alternative method of detecting planetary companions that overcomes many of the difficulties inherent in the classical methods .",
    "mao & paczyski ( 1991 ) first proposed that microlensing could be used to detect planets ; their ideas were subsequently expanded on by gould & loeb ( 1992 ) .",
    "soon after these first two seminal theoretical papers , several microlensing planet searches were initiated ( pratt et  al .",
    "1995 , albrow et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and microlensing searches have now been ongoing , in some form , for nearly a decade . here",
    "i review the basic theoretical concepts behind planetary microlensing , and describe how microlensing planet searches work in practice .",
    "i then give an overview of what the analyses of actual datasets have taught us about the practicality of the method itself , and about planetary companions in general .",
    "finally , i briefly speculate on future prospects for microlensing planet searches .",
    "toward the galactic bulge , microlensing occurs when a compact object , typically a low - mass star , passes close to our line - of - sight to a more distant star .",
    "the lens splits the source into two images separated by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the einstein ring radius of the lens , @xmath13 is defined by , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the distances between the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source , respectively .",
    "thus for typical microlenses toward the bulge , the images are unresolved , and the only observable is the sum of the magnification of the two images of the source , which depends ( only ) on the angular separation between the lens and source in units of @xmath18 . since observer , source , and lens are in relative motion , this angular separation , and thus the magnification , will be a function of time : a microlensing event .",
    "normal microlensing events have a characteristic , symmetric , three - parameter form .",
    "the parameters are the time of maximum magnification , the impact parameter , and the characteristic timescale of the event , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the relative lens - source proper motion .",
    "the timescale is the only parameter that carries any information about the lens .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the image geometry as a function of the angular separation of the source , and the resultant microlensing lightcurve .",
    "6.0 cm    if the primary lens has a planetary companion with projected position near the path of one of the two images created in the primary event , the planet will deflect the light from the image , creating a perturbation atop the nominal single lens curve .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "this perturbation is the signature of a planetary companion to the primary lens .",
    "three parameters describe the magnitude and shape of the perturbation , and hence define the observables .",
    "these are the mass ratio @xmath21 , the instantaneous projected separation @xmath22 between the planet and star , and the angle @xmath23 of the source trajectory with respect to the planet - star axis .",
    "the most interesting parameter is @xmath21 , which is related to and derived from the duration of the perturbation , @xmath24 , which is @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the orientation and phase of the planetary orbit , as well as @xmath18 , are all generally unknown ; thus @xmath22 gives only statistical information about the semi - major axis @xmath9 .",
    "since the planet must be near to one ( or both ) of the two images in order to be detected , and the images are near the einstein ring radius while the source is significantly magnified , microlensing is most sensitive to planets with @xmath27 , which corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "finally , @xmath23 is a randomly distributed , geometric parameter , and is of no physical interest .    for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath22 , only certain values of @xmath23 will lead to detectable perturbations ( see fig .  1 )",
    "therefore integration over @xmath23 defines a geometric detection probability .",
    "this detection probability is roughly @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the instantaneous magnification and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the detection probability is substantial , and high - magnification events are intrinsically more sensitive to planetary companions ( griest & safizadeh 1998 , rattenbury et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the advantages of microlensing are several .",
    "first , no flux is needed from either the lens or source , so systems with distances of many kiloparsecs can be probed .",
    "second , it is sensitive to planets at separations @xmath32 immediately , without monitoring for the entire orbital period .",
    "finally , since the duration of the signal drops only as @xmath33 , it is possible to extend the sensitivity to low masses .",
    "the primary disadvantages of microlensing are that follow - up of the detected systems will be difficult due to their large distances , the observations are non - repeatable , and the durations of the perturbations are short .",
    "these last two disadvantages combine to yield the requirement for successful detection of planets via microlensing : nearly continuous , densely sampled , and reasonably accurate photometry of the primary microlensing events .",
    "the probability that a star toward the galactic bulge will be microlensed at any given time is of order @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , survey collaborations ( eros , afonso et  al.2001 ; moa , bond et  al .  2001 ; ogle , udalski et  al .",
    "2000 ) must monitor several millions of stars at a time in order to detect ongoing events .",
    "practically , this means that several fields are monitored on a once - per - night basis , and the photometry is generally not optimized for any given microlensing event .",
    "therefore , current survey photometry is generally not sufficient to detect planetary companions .",
    "however , real - time data reduction enables these collaborations to issue alerts , public notification of ongoing events.@xmath35iab / alert / alert.html.]@xmath35ftp / ogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html .",
    "] this allows follow - up collaborations ( export , tsapras et  al .",
    "2001 ; mps , rhie et  al .",
    "2000 ; planet , albrow et  al .",
    "2000 ) to monitor only those events that are ongoing at any given time , and to optimize sampling rates and exposures times to individual events .",
    "an example of this two - tier procedure is shown in figure 2 .",
    "on the left is the ogle lightcurve for the alert ogle-1998-bul-14 . on the right is the planet photometry of the same event ( albrow et  al .",
    "while the ogle dataset is relatively sparse , the median sampling interval for the planet data is about 1 hour , or @xmath36 , with very few gaps greater than 1 day .",
    "the @xmath37 scatter in @xmath38 over the peak of the event ( where the sensitivity to planets is the highest ) is @xmath39 .",
    "the dense sampling and excellent photometry means that the efficiency to detect massive companions in this event should be quite high .",
    "in fact , a rigorous search for planetary companions , and quantification of the detection efficiency ( gaudi & sackett 2000 ) , reveals that , although the dataset is indeed quite sensitive to @xmath40 planets at separations of @xmath41 , there is no evidence for a companion .",
    "analyses of similar datasets of other events using a variety of techniques have clearly demonstrated that the requisite photometric accuracy and sampling needed to robustly detect planetary perturbations is readily achievable ( albrow et  al .",
    "2000 , rhie et  al .",
    "2000 , bond et  al .  2002 , tsapras et  al .",
    "therefore microlensing is not only sensitive to @xmath42 companions between @xmath43 in principle , but also in practice .",
    "analyses of datasets of individual microlensing events have demonstrated that microlensing is a practical method to detect @xmath44 planetary companions , and in some have cases ruled out companions to individual lenses over a large range of separations . however , a coherent , uniform analysis of a significant sample of events is necessary to draw conclusions about the population of companions to lenses as a whole .",
    "the first such study was performed by the planet collaboration , who analyzed their complete database of photometric measurements of bulge microlensing events during the first five years of their campaign , from 1995 to 1999 ( gaudi et  al .",
    "2002 ) . after applying cuts to eliminate nearly equal - mass binaries , poorly sampled events , and poorly - constrained events , a well - defined sample of 43 events was analyzed .",
    "each event was searched for planetary perturbations .",
    "there were no clear detections . for each event ,",
    "the detection efficiency was computed for a broad range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , using the method of gaudi & sackett ( 2000 ) .",
    "these efficiencies were then combined to produce an upper limit to the fraction @xmath45 of lenses with a companion . the @xmath46 confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "upper limit to @xmath45 from the planet five year analysis is shown in figure 3 .",
    "although microlensing constraints are the most robust and least model - dependent in the @xmath47-plane , this parameterization makes it difficult to compare with other methods , which are primarily sensitive to @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to convert from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the typical mass @xmath49 and physical einstein ring radius @xmath50 of the primaries , and also to marginalize over all possible orientations and orbital phases ( as @xmath22 is the instantaneous projected separation ) .",
    "it is likely that the majority of the microlensing primaries are m dwarfs in the galactic bulge ( gould 2000 , albrow et  al .",
    "thus @xmath51 and @xmath52 . with these values , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting constraints in the @xmath48-plane .",
    "the planet analysis demonstrates that @xmath1 of m dwarfs in the galactic bulge have jupiter - mass companions with separations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and less than 45% have @xmath5 companions between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the range of parameter space constrained by planet observations partially overlaps that surveyed by rv studies ; indeed many of the planets detected by rv surveys fall within the planet 45% exclusion region .",
    "however , the fractions of local stars with planets in this range is @xmath55 , and so the rv results are not in conflict with microlensing constraints .",
    "indeed , as rv and microlensing surveys are probing disjoint populations , both in regards to the typical mass of the primaries ( @xmath56 for rv versus @xmath57 for microlensing ) , and the parent populations ( local stars for rv versus bulge stars for microlensing ) , a comparison between rv and microlensing results would likely provide clues as to how planet formation and survival depends on the primary mass and local environment . as i discuss in the next section , although microlensing constraints have not yet reached the fractions currently probed by rv surveys , continued monitoring should allow a meaningful comparison between the two methods in the next few years .",
    "in the immediate future , microlensing searches for extrasolar planets are likely to continue with the current two - tier `` survey / follow - up '' system",
    ". how can such searches be improved , and the rate at which statistics are obtained increased ?",
    "some improvement can be achieved by more efficient monitoring of events and/or by employing image subtraction , rather than psf - fitting , photometry . however , the most crucial factor in the efficiency of the survey / follow - up system is the number and quality of the alerts provided by the survey collaborations .",
    "a large number of alerts allows the follow - up collaborations to monitor only those events that are the most promising and most efficient for the detection of planetary perturbations , i.e.  bright , high - magnification events .",
    "previous to 2002 , @xmath58 alerts per year were provided by the various survey collaborations .",
    "however , the ogle collaboration recently upgraded its camera system ( udalski et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and an extrapolation from the number of events alerted so far this year suggests that @xmath59 per year can be expected . assuming photon - limited photometry , optimal observational strategies , and that a fraction @xmath60 of lenses have companions with mass ratio @xmath21 , and separations uniformly distributed in the range @xmath61 , the rate @xmath62 at which planetary detections can be expected is roughly , @xmath63 thus current survey / follow - up microlensing searches should probe companion frequencies of a few percent over the next several years .",
    "microlensing is unique among planet detection methods in that , to zeroth order , the amplitude of the signal does not decrease as @xmath21 decreases .",
    "therefore , very low - mass planets are in principle detectable via microlensing .",
    "the ultimate limit is set by the size of the source star : if the angular size of the source @xmath64 is larger than @xmath65 , the signal will be ` washed out ' by the finite size of the source . for main - sequence sources , this limit is reached at about @xmath66 , the mass ratio between an earth mass planet and the typical microlensing primary . the duration and detection probability both decrease as @xmath33 . for @xmath67 , the duration of the perturbation",
    "is @xmath68 and the detection probability is a few percent ( bennett & rhie 1996 )    even if the photometric accuracies and sampling rates required to detect the perturbations from earth - mass planets are achieved , a naive extrapolation of equation ( 3 ) suggests that it will be quite difficult to build up reasonable statistics on earth - mass planets using the survey / follow - up method .",
    "this is simply due to the low detection probability and the finite total exposure time .",
    "ground - based detection of earth - mass planets might be possible via a ` next - generation ' ground - based microlensing planet search .",
    "such a search dispenses with the survey / follow - up model .",
    "instead , it employs a network of 2m - class telescopes distributed throughout the southern hemisphere equipped with large - format ccds that continually monitor a few fields toward the bulge at extremely high cadence to simultaneously detect _ and _ monitor events for planets .",
    "the primary difficulties with ground - based surveys for earth - mass planets are weather , which hampers the ability to robustly detect and constrain the planetary perturbations , and atmospheric seeing , which causes main - sequence sources to be severely blended even in exceptional conditions , thereby increasing the photometric noise .",
    "a space - based mission would overcome these difficulties .",
    "the galactic exoplanet survey telescope ( gest ) , a proposed 2 m aperture telescope with a @xmath69 square degree field - of - view would provide interesting constraints on earth - mass planets , including earth analogs ( bennett & rhie 2002 ) . the primary disadvantage of a space - based survey is the high cost .    both next - generation ground - based surveys and space - based missions would also be sensitive to very wide separation and free - floating planets ( di stefano & scalzo 1999a , b ) .",
    "microlensing is the only method yet proposed to detect low - mass free - floating planets .",
