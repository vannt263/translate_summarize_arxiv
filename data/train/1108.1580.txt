    "in the supercooled state , glass - forming liquids exhibit many fascinating features @xcite in its dynamic behavior , such as multistage , non - exponential decay of fluctuations and a rapid growth of relaxation times with decreasing temperature . in these aspects , glassy systems challenge us with many interesting issues and questions which are not well resolved theoretically .    a popular phenomenological characterization of the dynamics of glassy systems , proposed by angell , @xcite is the classification of the dynamics as _ strong _ or _ fragile_. it classifies different glass formers on the basis of the temperature dependence of their viscosity @xmath0 or their structural relaxation time @xmath1 .",
    "quite generally , the rapid growth of @xmath1 with temperature @xmath2 can be represented by a generalized arrhenius form , @xmath3 with an effective temperature dependent activation energy @xmath4 . for _ strong _ systems ,",
    "this activation energy is essentially independent of temperature while _ fragile _ systems exhibit a strong temperature dependence of this quantity : it increases as @xmath2 is decreased .",
    "this implies that the relaxation mechanism is independent of temperature for the first type of systems , whereas for the other type , it depends on @xmath2 .",
    "although various measures of the extent of _ fragility _ exist in literature @xcite in terms of the slope of the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plot , the quantitative distinction between strong and fragile liquids at a microscopic level is not fully understood yet .",
    "following goldstein @xcite , a widely accepted way of looking at glassy dynamics is to view the dynamical evolution of the system in terms of the motion of a state point in configuration space , specified by @xmath7 coordinates for an @xmath8 particles system , over its potential energy surface , often referred to as potential energy landscape ( pel ) @xcite . for glass - forming liquids and other disordered systems such as spin glasses @xcite in general",
    ", a generic feature of the pel is the existence of a large number of local minima in it , so that the potential energy surface has very _ rough _ topography . at low temperature , in the supercooled regime",
    ", the system visits the neighborhood of a local minimum for very long times and makes occasional jumps to other minima close to the initial one over the barriers separating them .",
    "following this description , stillinger and weber @xcite showed that a useful approach towards the understanding of the low - temperature properties of such system with a rugged pel is to divide the configuration space into basins of attraction of the local minima and then formulate a statistical description in terms of the distributions of different properties of these local minima , denoted as _ inherent structures _",
    "( is ) , and their basins of attraction .",
    "stillinger also suggested @xcite a rationale for the difference between strong and fragile liquids based on the pel viewpoint .",
    "according to his idea , strong liquids have a uniformly rough pel and there is not much variation in the values of the energy barriers separating different inherent structures . on the contrary , the pel of fragile liquids have non - uniform roughness . at high temperatures , the system explores a pel with nearly uniform roughness due to its high kinetic energy , but at lower temperatures it explores the deep valleys with very different energy barriers , giving rise to a temperature - dependent average barrier height . the work of sastry et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the usefulness of this description , although the understanding of the dynamics in this approach still remains qualitative to a large extent .",
    "after early work @xcite on the implementation of a description based on inherent structures by supplementing conventional molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite with regular steepest - descent minimizations of the potential energy ( called _ quenches _ ) and thereby sampling the inherent structures , a large amount of activity has gone into the field in recent years and a variety of methods have been suggested to make the survey of the pel more efficient @xcite .",
    "once the inherent structures are sampled properly , rates of transition between them may also be calculated and the dynamics of the system can be described by the evolution of the probabilities of occupying different basins through a master equation @xcite .",
    "an important assumption behind such an approach is a separation of time scales i.e.  the assumption that the intra - basin relaxation time @xmath9 and the inter - basin relaxation time @xmath10 are well separated , @xmath11 .",
    "this is indeed a good assumption at low temperatures for which the typical barrier height @xmath12 . this formulation does not have the usual limitations arising from the requirement of long simulation times , since the master equation can be formally solved for all times .",
    "however , for writing down the rates of transition between two minima , we need to sample the barriers or transition states between them and finding transition states is much more demanding computationally than finding the local minima . however , in recent years , various methods @xcite have been developed to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the number of minima , @xmath13 for model glass formers increases exponentially with the number of particles in the system @xcite .",
    "so it is impractical to hope to list all the minima even for a system of moderate size , say one consisting of a few hundred particles .",
    "moreover , the formal solution of the master equation requires the diagonalization of matrix of order @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the applicability of this method has been restricted mostly to small system sizes till now @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can organize a _ set _ of inherent structures into larger _",
    "metabasin _ @xcite and set up a master equation dynamics for transitions between the metabasin @xcite .",
    "another aim of the metabasin construction is to define a space where the dynamics of the system point become markovian , a crucial assumption behind any master equation based description .",
    "the markovian assumption might break down for elementary jumps between the basins of inherent structure . however assigning the rate of transition between two metabasins",
    "is not straightforward as one needs to integrate out the intra - metabasin dynamics ( e.g. jumps between basins in the same metabasin ) in that case .",
    "also , the construction of the metabasins out of inherent structures is generally done using somewhat ad - hoc criteria @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the long - time , low - temperature dynamics of systems with a small number of particles ( say ten to hundred ) interacting via some model potential has been studied very efficiently using this coarse - grained ( in time ) master equation approach since one can make almost exhaustive search of all the minima ( a few hundreds to several thousands ) and obtain a moderately good number of transition states for them @xcite . though small ,",
    "these clusters captures many features of the complex dynamics @xcite observed in larger systems and hence constitute a good playground for relating the properties of the pel to the dynamics .    in the same spirit , we consider here the master equation dynamics in a connected _ network _ of minima @xcite , where the minima serve as the _ nodes _ and transition states as the _ edges _ of the network @xcite . in section [ sec.masterequation ] ,",
    "we briefly review the general formalism @xcite for calculating time autocorrelation functions of various physical quantities and the corresponding relaxation times based on the master equation dynamics in the network of minima .",
    "we show that a quantitative understanding of _ fragility _ can be obtained in this framework from an analysis of elementary jumps between inherent structures and the effective barrier @xmath4 appearing in the temperature dependence of the relaxation time can be directly calculated from the local properties of the minima and the transition states that connect them",
    ". we also comment on the breakdown of stokes - einstein @xcite relation observed in many glass formers from this perspective .    to test the validity of our results ,",
    "we study of the equilibrium dynamics of a cluster of 13 atoms interacting by the morse potential @xcite in sections [ sec.networkmorsecluster ] and [ sec.dynamicsmorsecluster ] .",
    "the pel of this system has been studied in detail in the past @xcite and a nearly exhaustive list of minima and transition states has been obtained .",
    "the pel resembles a funnel , in which the minima are organized into pathways of decreasing energy leading to the global minimum .",
    "this system has the nice property of having a complex landscape that consists of a fairly large but still manageable number of minima and also displaying some of the salient features of the complicated dynamics of glassy system , as we report in section [ sec.dynamicsmorsecluster ] . by restricting the system to sample certain parts of the pel excluding a few lowest - lying minima",
    ", we are able to show that the dynamics of the system in this restricted part of the configuration space exhibits characteristic behavior of _ fragile _ systems , i.e.  @xmath4 is perceptibly temperature dependent , whereas the dynamics in the full pel exhibits _ strong _ features . we have also carried out md simulation for the 13-atom morse cluster . using simulations in which the md trajectories are confined @xcite in appropriately restricted parts of the pel",
    ", we are able to substantiate the conclusions of the network model calculation .",
    "the results from md simulations are discussed and compared with those obtained from the network model in section [ sec.md ] .",
    "some of the technical details of the network model calculations and restricted md simulations are described in the appendices [ app.activationenergy ] , [ app.buildnetwork ] and [ app.intervalbisection ] .",
    "the first step in exploring the landscape is to find the configuration corresponding to the local minima and the transition states .",
    "these are the stationary points or",
    "_ saddles _ of the potential energy function @xmath15 , characterized by @xmath16 and number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the @xmath19-th coordinate of the @xmath20-th particle .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to each negative eigenvalue of the hessian matrix at a stationary point signifies an unstable direction and stationary points can be indexed by the number of such unstable directions .",
    "for instance , at a local minimum , there is no negative eigenvalue and it can be denoted as saddle of index 0 , a transition state as saddle of index 1 or first - order saddle and similarly there can be higher order saddle points having index running from 2 to the dimension of the configuration space .",
    "one can use steepest descent minimization @xcite for finding the minima and transition states can be located efficiently using the eigenvector following method @xcite .",
    "once the minima and transition states that connect them are known , we can arrange them by designating as _ nodes _ and _ edges _ , respectively , of a network .",
    "we describe this procedure in greater detail later for the specific case of a 13-atom morse cluster ( see also appendix [ app.buildnetwork ] ) .    in the model of a connected network of potential energy minima ,",
    "the master equation for the jump dynamics can be written as @xmath21 @xmath22 is the probability that the system is at minimum @xmath23 at time @xmath24 , if it was at a minimum @xmath25 at time @xmath26 and @xmath23 runs from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , the total number of minima in the network .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath29 are the transition rates and , as usual , the diagonal elements are fixed by the condition @xmath30 implying @xmath31 . in order to obtain an asymptotic behavior ( in the long time limit ) that agrees with the boltzmann distribution , the occupation probability must satisfy @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is such that @xmath34 and the pre - exponential factor follows from a harmonic approximation for the partition function in the basin of each minimum ( we take the boltzmann constant @xmath35 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath36 is the hessian matrix for the @xmath23-th minimum . as @xmath29 ought to satisfy the detailed balance relation @xmath37 , in numerical calculation it is more convenient to express the solution in terms of the eigenvectors of the real symmetric matrix @xmath38 .",
    "finally , one can formally obtain the solution of the master equation for all time , i.e.  @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 are the eigenvectros of @xmath41 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 has one zero eigenvalue corresponding to the equilibrium distribution and all other eigenvalues are negative .",
    "we shall follow the convention of arranging @xmath42 s in descending order ( ascending order in their absolute values ) starting from @xmath44 .",
    "the model is well - defined once we give an appropriate expression for the transition or _ hopping _ matrix @xmath41 between the nodes of the network of minima , treating the problem as a markovian brownian multi - dimensional motion in the over - damped friction regime @xcite , we can write the transition rates between a directly connected or nearest - neighbor pair of minima , @xmath45 , from @xmath25 to @xmath23 over the saddle @xmath46 as @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the down frequency at the saddle point i.e.  @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the magnitude of negative eigenvalue of the hessian matrix @xmath51 at the transition state , @xmath52 is the friction constant that sets the time scale ( we take @xmath53 in all our calculation henceforth ) , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are , respectively , the potential energies at the minimum @xmath25 and the saddle point @xmath46 between minima @xmath23 and @xmath25 . if there are multiple barriers connecting @xmath25 and @xmath23 then the total transition rate from @xmath25 to @xmath23 , @xmath56 is obtained by summing over all the barriers i.e.  @xmath57 .",
    "to study the dynamics and calculate relevant relaxation times in the network model , one needs to define the equilibrium time autocorrelation function of some physical quantity , say @xmath58 , a generic observable which depends on the collective coordinate @xmath59 at times @xmath24 . in this language ,",
    "the time autocorrelation function can be written @xcite as @xmath60 here @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "also , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are short - time and long - time limits of the correlation function @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "once the correlation function is calculated , the relaxation time can be estimated by assuming a pure debye ( single exponential ) relaxation , such that @xmath66 and evaluating the area under the resulting curve from eq .",
    ", i.e. @xmath67 this way of defining the relaxation time relies on the assumption that the decay of @xmath68 is well described by a single exponential , but in glassy systems the temporal decay of correlation often follows a profile that is more complex than a simple exponential .",
    "the precise form of the decay is usually not known , although it can be fitted with the empirical kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) or stretched exponential function @xcite @xmath69 in many cases . here",
    "@xmath70 is a measure of the relaxation time and @xmath71 is the kww ( or stretching ) exponent . the above form [ eq . ] and other typical features of glassy dynamics such as the decoupling of transport coefficients ( i.e.  the violation of the stokes - einstein relation @xmath72 , @xmath0 and @xmath73 being the viscosity and diffusion coefficient , respectively ) can be rationalized from the hypothesis of the existence of a distribution of time scales that is not sharply peaked at a particular value .",
    "a distribution of time scales may arise e.g.  from _ dynamical heterogeneity _ that describes spatial variations of the local relaxational dynamics ( i.e. the fact that different parts of the sample may have different relaxation times ) .",
    "given a distribution of relaxation times , @xmath74 , the temporal decay of a typical time autocorrelation function , reflecting the effects of all these relaxation processes , is given by @xmath75 and one can easily show that this results in a stretched exponential form for an appropriate distribution @xmath74 . in the present master equation framework ,",
    "a distribution of relaxation time is naturally provided by the different modes @xmath76 and one can identify the contribution or _ weight _",
    "[ similar to @xmath77 in eq .",
    "] of the @xmath78-th mode as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the relaxation time corresponding to the @xmath78-th mode .",
    "a distribution of relaxation times in the jump dynamics on the pel appears due to a _ heterogeneous _ distribution of barrier heights contributing to different relaxation _ channel _ @xmath78 .",
    "though the origin of non - exponential relaxation due to a broad distribution of relaxation times in the master equation based framework looks superficially similar to that due to dynamical heterogeneity mentioned above , the precise correspondence between the _ heterogeneity _ of barrier heights in the configuration space and _ dynamical heterogeneity _ in the real space is not very clear .",
    "as shown in appendix [ app.activationenergy ] , one can utilize eq . to directly calculate the temperature dependent activation energy @xmath4 [ or , more precisely @xmath81 to a good approximation and a quantitative measure , namely @xmath82 , of the participation of individual barriers ( or the pairs of minima that are connected by the barrier ) in the relaxation process",
    "we have tested these results [ eqs . and in appendix [ app.activationenergy ] ] for the case of 13-atom morse cluster in section [ sec.dynamicsmorsecluster ]",
    ".      since we are mainly interested in structural relaxation of the system as its state point explores different regions of the pel , we look for the time autocorrelation function of quantities related to the configurations of the minima .",
    "one such quantity whose autocorrelation function and related relaxation time is of much interest in glass physics is the off - diagonal microscopic stress tensor @xcite , i.e.  @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "here , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the @xmath19-th components of the velocity of the @xmath20-th particle and @xmath87 , respectively , while @xmath88 .",
    "since the velocity @xmath89 is not defined in the model , following reference @xcite , we neglect the kinetic energy term and work with the following quantity @xmath90 consequently , we can calculate the stress - stress autocorrelation function @xmath91 from eq . where we need to insert @xmath92 .",
    "the shear viscosity , @xmath93 , is related to the stress autocorrelation function .",
    "we compute another correlation function , termed as _ overlap function _",
    "@xmath94 , by setting @xmath95 in eq .",
    "to meaningfully compare the prediction of the network model with md ( see section [ sec.md ] ) . the basin of attraction @xmath96 of the @xmath23-th minimum is the set of state points that flow to the @xmath23-th minimum under steepest descent minimization and @xmath97 is the usual kronecker delta function .",
    "the correlation function @xmath94 decays solely due to transitions between inherent structures and it can be calculated from md simulation as we show in section [ sec.md ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have carried out md simulations @xcite for the cluster of 13 particles interacting via the morse potential [ eq . ] .",
    "initial long md runs along with regular quenching provide the starting data base of minima and then we follow the procedure of appendix [ app.buildnetwork ] to improve the list as well as to construct the network of minima and transition states .",
    "the main motivation of our md study is to check to what extent the dynamics of the systems is captured by the network model by comparing the results of the network model calculation with those for the real dynamics ( i.e.  newton s equation of motion ) .",
    "we find that the main results of the network model calculation are supported both qualitatively and quantitatively by the md results .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the model assumes that there is a clear separation between the time scales of local vibrations and activated jumps .",
    "this assumption is bound to be valid at very low temperature where the barriers are much higher than the temperature .",
    "however , the barrier heights have a wide distribution ( fig.[fig.pesdetails ] * c * ) and hence the assumption of well separated time scales may be invalidated at different temperatures for different parts of the landscape .",
    "presumably , as the temperature is increased , the dynamics crosses over from a landscape dominated regime at low temperatures to a high - temperature regime where the system does not see the details of the pel due to its large thermal energy and the dynamics is no longer dominated by activation processes .",
    "we have calculated the stress autocorrelation function @xmath98 and the overlap function @xmath94 ( sec.[subsec.structuralrelaxation ] ) from md simulations at different temperatures .",
    "also , we have estimated the mean waiting times and waiting time distributions .",
    "we find that due to intra - basin relaxation present in md , the stress autocorrelation function @xmath98 decays within the vibrational time periods of the local minima much before the inter - basin jump dynamics comes into play . as a result",
    ", @xmath98 is not useful for comparison with the network model results .",
    "hence we concentrate on @xmath94 and the related relaxation time since by definition the decay of @xmath94 is entirely determined by inter - basin transitions . for calculating this quantity as well as the waiting times for different minima , we construct a discontinuous trajectory in terms of configurations of inherent structures from the md trajectory and track the transitions along it by the _ interval bisection _",
    "method described in reference @xcite [ see appendix [ app.intervalbisection ] ] .    for comparing the results obtained for @xmath99 ( sec.[sec.networkmorsecluster ] ) , additionally , we need to confine the md trajectories in a restricted part of the configuration space so that the basins of the four lowest - lying minima are not visited ( see appendix [ app.intervalbisection ] ) .",
    "this goal is achieved by applying a procedure similar to that described in refs @xcite .",
    "the application of this method in conjunction with the interval bisection method makes the md runs very time consuming and hence it is difficult to get very long md trajectories ( typically @xmath100 or @xmath101 md steps with the md step length @xmath102 ) .",
    "so we have averaged over many parallel runs with smaller number of md steps ( @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 to @xmath103 for @xmath99 , depending on the temperature ) starting from different parts of the landscape i.e. different initial conditions ( different is configurations are taken from the already existing data base ) .",
    "we compare the results for @xmath94 obtained through the network model for @xmath104 and @xmath99 with those obtained via _",
    "md @xcite in figs.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nf ] and [ fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] , respectively .",
    "fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nf ] * a * shows the network model results for @xmath106 in @xmath104 .",
    "corresponding md results are shown in fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nf ] * b*. the arrhenius plots for associated relaxation times are shown in figs.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nf ] * c * and * d*. the _ strong _ behavior is evident and decays of @xmath94 in both the cases are close to exponential ( @xmath107 ) as exhibited in the insets of these figure panels .",
    "a good estimate of the effective activation energy is once again obtained from eq .",
    "( inset of fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nf ] * c * ) . here",
    "the effective barrier @xmath108 is comparable to @xmath2 in the temperature range of interest and hence the associated time scale for relaxation is quite short .",
    "even then , an accurate calculation of the correlation function @xmath94 and the relaxation time @xmath109 in md is quite difficult because the system gets trapped in the deep global minimum most of the time and a proper sampling of the relevant relaxation paths connecting the higher minima to the global one becomes hugely time consuming and increasingly difficult with decreasing temperature . as a result",
    "we can estimate @xmath109 only for a limited range of temperatures , as shown in fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nf]*d*. also for temperatures higher than @xmath110 the network model dealing only with the activated processes becomes unreliable , rendering a comparison with md results inappropriate .    for the network @xmath99 , @xmath94 exhibits a three - stage relaxation profile ( fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] * a * ) owing to the presence of well - separated time scales similar to the case of @xmath98 ( fig.[fig.stressautocorrelation_nr ] * b * ) .",
    "such a clear cut separation of timescale is not observed in the corresponding _ microcanonical _",
    "md @xcite results for @xmath94 shown in fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] * b * , although a faint signature of multi - step relaxation can be seen at low temperatures .",
    "the decays of @xmath94 at various temperatures , shown in fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] * a * , are fitted to a sum of three stretched exponentials [ eq . ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the intermediate relaxation time @xmath111 shows deviations from the arrhenius form [ eq . ] in fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] * c * , although much less in extent than that for @xmath112 ( fig.[fig.stressautocorrelation_nr ] * c * ) .",
    "the latter fact is indicative of the importance of the quantity @xmath113 of eq .",
    "i.e.  the quantity whose autocorrelation function is used to calculate the relaxation time , in determining the degree of fragility obtained from the temperature dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "as discussed above , the distribution and temperature dependence of the quantities @xmath82 , which depend on the quantity @xmath114 whose autocorrelation function is used to calculate the relaxation time ( see appendix [ app.activationenergy ] ) , play an important role in determining the degree of fragility .",
    "we have checked that plots of @xmath115 for the overlap function , similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.minimapairweight ] , exhibit a less pronounced dependence on the temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the temperature dependence of the relaxation time extracted from the decay of the overlap function exhibits smaller deviations from the arrhenius form ( lower degree of fragility ) in comparison to that for the relaxation time obtained from the stress autocorrelation function .",
    "the arrhenius fit parameter @xmath116 and vft fit parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 are shown in fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] * c*. these agrees reasonably well with the results of similar fits done for @xmath109 estimated through md simulations ( fig.[fig.overlapcorrelation_nr ] * d * ) .",
    "our work shows that the master equation based approach , first proposed by angelani _",
    "et al._@xcite , for the landscape dominated activated dynamics on a network of minima and transition states is capable of addressing many important issues and challenges related to glassy dynamics .",
    "our results for the full network @xmath104 are similar to those of refs.@xcite where _ _ s__trong behavior in the dynamics , arising from the dominance of the global minimum and the barriers surrounding it , was observed .",
    "our study of the restricted network @xmath99 leads to the important result that the master equation approach may lead to fragile dynamic behavior if many inherent structures and the barriers between pairs of them are involved in the relaxation process .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by our md simulations .",
    "our study , thus , provides valuable insights into the origin of fragile dynamic behavior in glass - forming liquids .",
    "it also illustrates the usefulness of the master equation approach in studies of glassy dynamics . due to computational constraints ,",
    "the applicability of this approach has been limited to small system sizes till now",
    ". a related approach @xcite that differs from the one considered here in the details of its implementation seems to be a promising one for studying larger systems .",
    "another interesting future direction for studying moderately large systems might be to extend this framework for the dynamics in the _ metabasin _ space to obtain quantities relevant for the characterization of glassy dynamics .",

    "bearing this fact in mind , we do quenches for equidistant points , @xmath137 ( @xmath78 being an integer ) to get @xmath138 with @xmath139 md steps ( around @xmath140-th of the typical vibrational period at a minimum for the morse cluster ) . during a md run , starting from initial point ( @xmath141 ) ,    1 .",
    "save the trajectory @xmath142 between @xmath143 and @xmath144 and then follow the steps described below provided @xmath145 ( actually we compare @xmath146 instead of @xmath147 ) , 1 .",
    "set @xmath148 and get @xmath149 from @xmath150 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath151 , set @xmath152 else set @xmath153 .",
    "3 .   go on repeating steps ( a ) and ( b ) until @xmath154 .",
    "2 .   change @xmath78 to @xmath155 and go back to 1 .",
    "next we describe the method that we have adopted for restricting the trajectory of the state point of the system to a part of the configuration space .",
    "this is an extension of the interval bisection method described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the trajectory is constructed part by part successively and in each part , whenever we detect a transition ( using the interval bisection method ) from the _ allowed _ part to _ forbidden _ part ( say the part containing the basins of attraction of the four lowest - lying minima with @xmath156 in the case of the 13-atom morse cluster ) , we re - initiate the md at the point when the system last visited the allowed part using new velocities for the particles .",
    "we assign random velocities drawn from a maxwell distribution at temperature @xmath2 [ in the case of microcanonical simulation at constant @xmath157 , the temperature is obtained from the total kinetic energy at the instant when the system last visited the allowed part i.e.  @xmath158 .",
    "after each such re - initiation we correct for the integrals of motion i.e.  energy , momentum and angular momentum by suitable rescaling and rotation of the velocities .    under this procedure",
    "the dynamics no longer remains truly newtonian due to repeated velocity re - initiations .",
    "we have calculated the velocity autocorrelation function which decays very fast ( within 2000 md steps i.e.  @xmath1591 - 2 vibrational periods ) and heuristically we can argue that successive velocity re - initiations are more or less uncorrelated .",
    "nonetheless , following reference @xcite we have performed a few standard checks by computing quantities that can be accessed through the above mentioned _ confined _ md as well as through the regular unrestricted md procedure and we found good agreement between the results obtained in these two different ways .",
    "for instance , the distributions of the total kinetic energy and the waiting time for a restricted part of the configuration space ( e.g.  the basin of attraction of a particular minimum ) can be estimated @xcite both by enforcing the trajectory to sample only the specified part or by picking out from a conventional long md trajectory the intervals during which the system samples the specified part .",
    "we find that there are some spurious effects in the dynamics due to cycling of trajectories near the saddles or the system spending more time near the border of the allowed and forbidden regions .",
    "also , at low temperatures , when the system is constrained in the high energy parts such as @xmath99 , it has a tendency to visit the lowest lying basins more often . in the above mentioned procedure the system can visit the forbidden region within the small interval @xmath160 and come back to the allowed part .",
    "we find these events to affect the properties related to short time relaxation such as the diffusion constant [ eq .",
    "] , waiting time @xmath161 [ eq . ] and its distribution . while restricting the system in @xmath99 , as the system frequently escapes to the four lower lying basins , the barrier that appears in the temperature dependence of @xmath73 and @xmath161 turns out to be related to the barriers connecting @xmath99 to the forbidden low - energy part .",
    "however , since these visits are really short lived ( @xmath162 md steps ) , they do not affect the features of long - time relaxation , such as the decay of correlations characterized by @xmath94 .",
