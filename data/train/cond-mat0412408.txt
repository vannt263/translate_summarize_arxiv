    "matter organisations at a mesoscopic ( molecular  cluster ) level typically manifest a multitude of microstructural rearrangements . cluster ",

    "coagulation phase transformations , sol - gel systems , ( wet ) sand or rice piles , etc . , are manifestations of loosely - packed rearrangements , typically occurring under moderate or high temperature conditions .",
    "in contrast ripened polycrystals , sintered powders , soap froths and bubbles , and other cellular systems , constitute a type of rearrangement that usually emerges in a ( relatively ) low temperature limit and under certain (  field dependent  ) matter close  packing constraints .",
    "beside such an agglomeration , fracture , desaggregation , desorption , dissolution , and alike , can be thought to be the  inverse process  , finding its place in the opposite part of the relevant phase diagram @xcite .    in all of them spatial as well as temporal signatures of chaotic behavior , due to matter reorganisations ,",
    "can be detected : they are temperature and space - dimension dependent . in particular",
    ", one can show rigorously that in the limit of the spatial dimension going to infinity loosely - packed agglomerations become non  chaotic by suppressing totally their instability growing mode since it is related to the nonequilibrium agglomerate s entropy @xcite , while their closed - packed counterparts are not . when the growing mode is coupled to a mechanical stress relaxation mode as a power law via some phenomenological relation of hall ",
    "petch  griffith ( h - p - g ) @xcite type ( an onsager - type conjecture @xcite of the present study ) , certain marks of bethe  lattice frustration , related to a spatial overcrowding of the cayley ",
    "tree branches , appear in the ( mean - field ) approach - a kind of frustration qualitatively of very similar type than that observed in verhulst - type systems in an adequate time and parametric zone .    in the specific cases discussed in this review , however , by increasing the space dimension , @xmath0",
    ", we automatically induce some increase of the possible number of degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "thus , when taking into account the coupling of the late - time growing and relaxation modes , say , in a fairly synchronized viz power - law way of h - p - g type , one obtains that even though the material s relaxation goes slower than in the case when such a coupling is proposed in an unsynchronized ( debye - relaxation involoving , i.e. rapid ) way , one is , however , able to establish or restore an apparent dynamic microstructural order within the system the nonequilibrium ( chaotic ) measures of which are proposed below .",
    "there is , unfortunately , no way of establishing such an order when the coupling fails the power - law type synchronization requirement @xcite .",
    "thus , when an ample space amongst the clusters is recovered by the system at its mature growing stage , we consider that the system successfully tries to avoid a chaotic matter organisation in space .",
    "note that temperature may markedly help in surmounting the activation - energy barrier of the agglomeration , especially when it is raised appropriately , whence when not \" damaging a possibly smooth evolution of the system .",
    "full success is , however , guaranteed when the limit of @xmath1 is reached .",
    "if there is no chance for recovering the ample space , the late - time growing stage is realized in a moderately chaotic way .",
    "the mechanical stress relaxation , in turn , enters a readily chaotic regime , since the ( nonequilibrium ) entropy of the system diverges to plus infinity .",
    "the overall scenario resembles , in general , a formation of large ( fractal ) colloid aggregates that typically occurs with and without temperature and/or space - dimension dependent gravity factor domination , like as if imposing some limits to gelation of colloids @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2 , we define both the closely - packed as well as loosely - packed agglomerations , calling the latter the aggregation throughout . in section 3 , we list some qualitative signatures of chaos in matter - agglomerating systems , and refer briefly to different definitions as well as meanings of chaos . in section 4 ,",
    "we present quantitative measures of chaos signatures in systems of interest , whereas in section 5 we unveil number - theoretic measures , featuring a chaotic spatio - temporal behavior of them . in section 6 , according to some suggestions given in @xcite , on which much of our report is based , in order to see which agglomerations behave orderly or non - chaotically , we explore the limit of @xmath1 , and arrive at a certain interesting ( perhaps , surprising ) conclusion , favoring aggregation of matter , or some structural loosely - packed , and typically high - temperature , matter rearrangements  in contrast to those emerging under close - packing low - temperature conditions .",
    "we close the paper by offering a concluding address in section 7 .",
    "following @xcite , throughout the present study , we wish to distinguish between the notions of agglomeration and aggregation of matter . by the former we mean an assembly of grains or molecular clusters , kept together by relatively strong forces ( _ e.g. _ ionic ) , so that there is no easy possibility of taking the clusters apart , or destroying them . for the latter , because of the appearance of weak bonds between clusters , such as van der waals or hydrogen types , the possibility of cluster separation becomes an observed tendency of the matter rearrangement due to their weak bonds . for a schematic explanation of the difference between both matter arrangements ,",
    "see fig . 1 .    ) and loosely - packed ( right , denoted by @xmath2 ) agglomerations .",
    "two consecutive time steps @xmath3 and @xmath4 are shown .",
    "the former usually goes by a scenario with the preservation of the total agglomerate s volume ( though in a more irregular way , when its logarithmic speed is measured , cf .",
    "sections 36 ) , whereas the latter does not @xcite . in the former",
    ", the clusters do not perform a translational motion but their boundaries may fluctuate in time and space , even though they are quite strongly confined by their neighborhood . in the latter , an almost opposite situation in the time - and - space domain is typically observed .",
    "some void is left behind a loosely packed system , width=396,height=226 ]      as in previous work @xcite we begin with a local continuity equation @xmath5 preferrentially supplemented by the corresponding initial ( of delta - dirac type as a first attempt ) and boundary ( typically , of absorbing type ) conditions ( ibcs ) .    in a few subsequent studies",

    "@xmath6 f(v , t ) - { d ( v ) } { \\partial \\over \\partial v }   f(v , t )   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has been used @xcite , where @xmath7 is the distribution of clusters of volume @xmath8 : this means , that @xmath9 is the ( relative ) number of clusters with size in the infinitesimal volume interval @xmath10 $ ] ; @xmath11 is the time ; @xmath12 represents the physical potential , equivalent to the free energy of the system ( see @xcite for an explanation of the term ) .",
    "it is assumed to be one of the most relevant drivers of the agglomeration process at the mesoscopic level , assuring its nonequilibrium character .",
    "in fact , the current ( [ jj ] ) , in the form presented above , comes from a rigorous derivation , starting from the gibbs equation for the entropy production @xcite .",
    "it has quite strong foundations anchored in nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that upon inserting eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) into the continuity equation , eq .",
    "( [ loccont ] ) , one gets a second - order partial differential equation of the fokker ",
    "kolmogorov ( f - p - k ) type @xcite . for the dynamics of such a system some routes to chaotic behavior have been sketched elsewhere by considering the ( in)stability of markov semigroups in @xcite .",

    "@xmath17 , and hence @xmath13 , could be measured by comparing the current and the thermodynamic force @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is to be inferred from the green  kubo ( g - k ) formula @xcite , so that there is some quite strong suggestion for deriving @xmath13 both , experimentally as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "there is a debate about a possible violation of the g - k formula @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is proved that for a gas of charged particles subjected to an external electric field , the mean mobility of a charged particle , based on the g - k formula , is reliably well estimated for suitably small values of the external field . moreover , at a microscopic scale one observes a nonlinear ( or chaotic ) behavior of the particles , which is , unfortunately , not reflected by the macroscopic ( mobilility ) measure . in our case",
    ", we assume algebraic correlations in @xmath8space , for a phenomenological formula . the assumption seems to be as natural as possible : @xmath19 ; that means that both the diffusivity @xmath20 and the mobility @xmath13 are proportional to the cluster hypersurface , @xmath21 .",
    "it should be underlined that it is , in our opinion , the common physical case in clustering phenomena , and is working properly at the mesoscopic level considered in our approach .",
    "notice right here that exactly the same assumption has been used to model in a f - p - k way the formation of surface nanostructure arrays @xcite .",
    "therein , an experimentally - observed passage between direct curvature - dependent ripening of matter nano - islands ( our densely - packed agglomeration ) , and inverse ripening , with an elastic - field caused contraction of growing quantum dots @xcite ( our sparsely - distributed agglomeration of matter ) , has been presented .",
    "there are , however , matter agglomerations , for a given @xmath22 , that do not conform usually to @xmath23 to them belong both some physical - metallurgical transformations @xcite , such as martensitic , and presumably , also certain phase orderings of non - diffusive kind , emerging in model biosystems , such as those occurring in lipid biomembranes @xcite .",
    "other than algebraic types of correlations in the hyperspace can likely be expected for these . if a power law of the type given by eq .",
    "( [ bvs ] ) can be kept for further modeling , some additional correlations in time must complete a more comprehensive correlational proposal , cf .",
    "other types of correlations in the hyperspace , even if they allow to get a general solution to the problem , may not accommodate the boundary conditions @xcite , so that one would expect either to be left with an unsolved specific problem or to encounter anomalous or irregular behavior of the agglomerating system @xcite .",
    "in such a case another type of finite , instead of infinite boundary boundary conditions @xcite , can sometimes give a remedy for the problem @xcite . here , under the term _ infinite boundary conditions _",
    "@xcite we typically understand the boundary conditions of absorbing ( dirchlet ) type @xmath24 in which the single cluster volume is taken at infinity , @xmath25 , whereas in case of the finite boundary conditions it assumes a finite value , @xmath26 , cf .",
    "@xcite , and a discussion therein .",
    "although the latter unquestionably seems more physical the former is more frequently used to reveal the evolutions in matter - agglomerating systems @xcite - this resembles to some extent a situation in statistical - thermodynamical systems undergoing an equilibrium phase transition : as such they are typically considered in the so - called thermodynamic limit ( here , with a number of subunits going to @xmath27 ) under the mentioned agglomeration - oriented , e.g. condensation conditions , and the analogy would presumably extend over the examined nonequilibrium evolutions too @xcite",
    ".      in previous work @xcite the analytic form of a ( so - called ) compaction potential was obtained , i.e. @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 - constants , and @xmath31 stands for some cluster radius . because @xmath32 one gets also @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "the logarithmic potential assures the emergence of rather compact and curvature - involving structures , whence the name of  compaction potential ",
    "it should be noted that @xmath12 is an entropic potential @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be a cause of some desaggregation , or matter - influenced impingement effects , occurring within the overall aggregation space .    in a previous study on the phase transformation kinetics for loosely packed `` diffusive '' agglomerates",
    "@xcite we have written the matter flux of a purely diffusive nature prescribed in configurational space as follows @xmath35 ( the diffusion function @xmath36 is proportional to the cluster ( grain ) surface . )    both closely - packed and loosely - packed agglomerations follow from the general form ( [ jj ] ) . indeed , the loosely - packed case is obtained when the first ( drift ) term in r.h.s . of ( [ jj ] ) can be neglected .",
    "formally , @xmath37 when @xmath38 . from the physical point of view , it corresponds to sufficiently high temperatures @xmath39 , where @xmath40 can be treated as a cross - over temperature above which the agglomeration takes place exclusively by yielding loosely - packed microstructures .",
    "however , the drift term in r.h.s . of ( [ jj ] ) depends both on @xmath8 and @xmath22 .",
    "it tends _ uniformly _ , which means independently of @xmath8 , to zero at the high temperature limit if @xmath41 then for a given system , temperature @xmath40 does not depend on @xmath8 and looks consistently defined .",
    "some additional argumentation can be provided that such a constant ( limit ) @xmath42 exists and is well - defined .",
    "namely , when applying both ( [ bv ] ) and ( [ sim ] ) one sees with sufficient accuracy that @xmath43 this means that @xmath42 is essentially determined by a product involving two contributions : a certain curvature - like term , @xmath44 , and some dimensionless energetic argument , @xmath45 . the above claimed high - temperature limit , with the cross - over temperature @xmath40 as a reference temperature characteristic of a system of interest , would naturally demand @xmath46 while , because of approaching the mature growing stage any change in the cluster radius must be small , @xmath47 , and therefore , its inverse would tend to some big value , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 will take on a finite value .",
    "it is believed that for certain agglomerations under readily high - temperature conditions it will eventually acquire a small value , i.e. very low , so that the mobility per se , even for a single biomolecule but also for a molecular cluster , must clearly be of negligible value @xcite , regardless of whether we measure it in the @xmath8space or , what is usually done , in a position space ] , that means , @xmath49 naturally holds .",
    "it is a case when the potential @xmath50 in @xcite a condition of setting the current equal to zero , @xmath51 , has been chosen to balance diffusive and non - diffusive terms in the f - p - k type description , cf .",
    "@xcite , aiming at getting a proper behavior of the metastable nanostructure @xcite arrays .",
    "we are of the opinion that such a proposal is legitimate in the relatively low - temperature domain .",
    "when the temperature is raised , but agglomeration is still allowed to occur , the proposal may fail .",
    "thus , the above is a possible solution for the high - temperature limit .",
    "a type of localization of the gaussian distribution , characteristic of the inverse ripening ( a metastable state of the nanostructure evolution ) can also be obtained within the present modeling , cf .",
    "this is the case of eq .",
    "( [ jd ] ) when in a ( readily ) mature growing stage , since the single volume @xmath8 of the cluster does not change much . as a matter of fact",

    "the above potential form ( [ phiv ] ) , designed for loosely - packed agglomeration , seems legitimate here : note that the force @xmath53 behaves like    @xmath54    because @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 acts as the inverse of the area of the cluster hypersurface , @xmath57 , which implies that the smaller the area is , the bigger the force acting on the cluster can be , this way impeding the formation of new clusters , which would contribute to an aggregate s density increase .",
    "qualitatively , a similar dependence is found for the closely - packed matter agglomeration : from ( [ philn ] ) one gets , as above , for the force @xmath58 here , @xmath56 acts as the inverse of the hypervolume of the cluster , @xmath59 , which makes a clear difference between closely - packed and loosely - packed agglomerations , presumably leading to a certain relaxation of the surface tension conditions for loosely - packed clusters - containing systems @xcite .    referring further to ( [ cond1 ] ) and using the similarity relation , eq .",

    "the existence of the coupling seems to be experimentally justified , see @xcite , and involves generically the viscoelastic nature of the mega - cluster late - stage formation @xcite .",

    "( [ lprel ] ) , one gets something like @xmath130 where typically @xmath131 . in the classical h - p - g limit @xmath132 holds .",
    "however @xmath133 may also strive for obtaining superplastic effects , i.e. when taking on fractional values , _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , and refs . therein .",
    "this is sometimes termed in physical - metallurgical literature the inverse h - p - g effect .",
    "because of eq .",
    "( [ frfr ] ) @xmath134 realize that formulae ( [ hp ] ) and ( [ hp2 ] ) might again be interpreted in terms of the onsager conjecture @xcite , see above . since the overall exponent in ( [ maxs ] ) reads",

    "it is interesting to note here that @xmath139 , i.e. @xmath140 a certain generator of the bethe  lattice elements , is recovered starting from the 3-bond ( initial ) generator for @xmath141 , and continuing with @xmath0 , upon identifying @xmath0 as the numbers of emerging bonds in a gelling system @xcite .",
    "this is a very useful tool for the mean - field description of gels , and other multi bond - containing systems .",

    "_ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", one can expect the same type of rule , eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) , for @xmath143 .",
    "let us recall that the fluctuations @xmath79 have been proposed as a reliable criterion of differentiating between aggregation and agglomeration , and that an efficiency ( harmonic - rule , see ( [ hr ] ) ) additional criterion , derived from the constructed fluctuational proposal , supports the aggregation in dimension @xmath0 ( @xmath144 ) , with an emphasis placed on @xmath145 , where golden - ratio - like or harmonic - mean properties are in favor .",
    "the mean - harmonic speed implies that the center of mass of a moving body , referred consequently to as the molecular cluster , may not span the same distance , say @xmath146 , back and forth , during a time period .",
    "this leads to a quite realistic quantification of a mean speed on the distance @xmath147 , and also shows that not an arithmetic mean of the back and forth speeds but a harmonic mean applies here .",
    "such a schedule can likely be extended over the aggregation that essentially relies on random matter attachments and/or detachments of particles @xcite , in such a way a forward sub - process may essentially go unidimensionally , like in a ballistic motion , whereas its reverse counterpart would explore the whole three - dimensional domain .",
    "this situation typically appears in the case of matter desorption , in which detachment occurs part by part from a `` reactive '' surface spot .    some other confirmation of ( mean ) harmonicity",
    ", its close relation to the golden rule , and to the fibonacci sequencing ( characterizing well the fractality of `` diffusive '' microstructures ) , is hidden in the ( macro)ion ( or , cluster @xcite ) diffusion coefficient @xmath148 , in our model , eq .",
    "( [ dalfa ] ) , which is also included in the free energy @xmath149 .",
    "the label , or the lower index , is simply @xmath150 , which for @xmath151 results in @xmath152 , for @xmath153 gives @xmath154 , whereas for @xmath155 offers @xmath156 .",
    "the values of the diffusion coefficient ( eq .",
    "( [ dalfa ] ) ) are : @xmath157 , @xmath158 as well as to @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "they correspond to the first five - number fibonacci sequence , composed of the numerators and denominators of @xmath160-s , like 0,1,1,2,3 , and obe @xmath161 , for the three subsequent fibonacci numbers @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "if so , one can provide the following two recursive formulae @xmath165 and @xmath166 where @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 are the first five fibonacci numbers . since the analogy with gelling systems seems evident @xcite , this can not be taken entirely as a surprise .",
    "the bonding in gels clearly goes as a branching process , being ( as in the case of ultrametric space ) quite naturally described geometrically in terms of fibonacci numbers , thereby involving the notion of fractality @xcite .    when finishing this section , let us note that both the characteristic chaotic measures , cf .",
    "( [ lpsp2 ] ) for example , have their random close - packing account @xmath71 involved .",
    "this is a landmark of randomness but readily appears as a space - filling action of modeled matter reorganisations .",
    "realize that our rationale may apply just in the same vein to cluters - containing assemblies , evolving in a @xmath0dimensional space , where a cluster is characterized by its fractal dimension @xmath172 , cf .",
    "consider the case @xmath173 .",
    "a corresponding chaotic measure for the late - stage growing event in the agglomeration of matter , very reminiscent of nonequilibrium correlational entropy measure @xcite , reads @xmath174}\\over { ln(t)}}\\big)}_{{for}\\quad t>>1 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas its counterpart for the relaxation is given by an analogous formula , namely that @xmath175}\\over { ln(t)}}\\big)}_{{for}\\quad t>>1 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] holds .",
    "they are consistent formally with the so - called correlational entropy ( kolmogorov  type ) measure , defined in @xcite and follow the rationale presented in @xcite , in which some measures of chaos in dynamical systems described by partial differential equations have been discussed . for `` thermostatic '' systems out of equilibrium",
    "one has to speak of the so - called generalized fractal dimension formalism , first introduced by grassberger and proccacia , see @xcite , and refs . therein .",
    "the most attractive reason for introducing such measures arises from the fact that if one evaluates both @xmath176 and @xmath177 , one unambigiously gets for the aggregation @xmath178 whereas for the close - packed agglomeration one provides @xmath179 and @xmath180 thus , for both cases , eq .",
    "( [ lpmeas1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lpmeasinf ] ) , one arrives at a chaotic behavior in the nonequilibrium system @xcite of a densely - packed agglomerate .",
    "this is not the case of the aggregation for which the common measure of its chaotic character is zero , cf .",
    "( [ lpmeas0 ] ) .",
    "thus , proceeding consistently with the approach offered in @xcite we may conclude that the late - time @xmath181 process develops in an ordered way .",
    "the case @xmath145 appears to be the most efficient since the harmonic - mean rule ( [ hr ] ) is applied ; for it the nonequilibrium character of the random process should be emphasized @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to realize that the system property called the harmonicity throughout is very much related to its nonequilibrium entropic or chaotic characteristic(s ) .",
    "based on the above , we are allowed to state the following : + ( i ) in matter - agglomerating systems chaos is revealed as a complex spatio - temporal and temperature - dependent phenomenon ; + ( ii ) nonequilibrium chaotic measures of any late - stage matter agglomeration modeled can be proposed relying upon the nonequilibrium kolmogorov - type entropy measure , which makes a reliable ( harmonic ) quantification of the tempo of the process ; + ( iii ) coupling late - stage matter agglomeration with relaxation of assisting elastic fields via an onsager - type @xcite , or , in the parlance of physical metallurgy , h - p - g conjecture @xcite , leads to several characteristic sub - effects ( bethe - lattice generator , first - five fibonaci - number signatures , random close - packing @xmath71criterion @xcite , etc . ) having their rationale in fundamental properties of the entropic or harmonic - mean character of the phenomenon ; + ( iv ) as for the formal point of view : the presented mesoscopic system , section 2 , serving to describe the matter aggregation can be derived rigorously based on the gibbs entropy production equation @xcite , and + ( v ) its chaotic signatures can be inferred as presented in sections 36 , supported somehow by the ideas contained in @xcite ; at this point , a general task remains to be done as to connect the type of chaos with the entropy - based scheme @xcite used to derive the equations of f - p - k @xcite , or diffusion , types @xcite , and how far the proposed measures of chaos ( also , the ones used in the present review ) are reminiscent of those used conventionally in nonlinear science @xcite ? perhaps , the edwards entropy measures for slowly moving grains , evolving ( bio)polymer- or colloid - type matrices and compacted powders could also contribute to solve the problem @xcite .",
