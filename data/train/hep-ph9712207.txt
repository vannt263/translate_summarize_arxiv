    "several challenging questions remain of central importance in the field of spin physics , and clearly one of them concerns the spin structure of the nucleon . in spite of the remarkable progress accomplished over the last ten years or so , both on the experimental side and on the theoretical side , we are still lacking a very precise answer to the fundamental question :    _ what are the different components of the nucleon spin ? _    the recent measurements at cern @xcite , desy @xcite and slac @xcite of polarized deep inelastic scattering with various polarized targets have led to the extraction of the spin - dependent nucleon structure functions @xmath1 , for proton and neutron , in a limited @xmath2 kinematic range .",
    "this information allows the determination of the various polarized parton distributions , which can be done with a reasonable accuracy only for valence quarks @xmath3 and @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , the situation remains largely ambiguous and controversial for sea quarks and gluons .",
    "this is the reason why several experiments are actually planned or under discussion to measure the gluon polarization @xmath7 in view of obtaining reliable information on this important physical quantity .",
    "+ details on these experiments can be found in the below two - fold table .",
    "this table recalls for each experiment a fair number of characteristic features , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "the upper part of the table contains two approved experiments to start running by the year 2000 or so ( rhic @xcite , compass @xcite ) ; in addition two recently introduced projects are summarized ( e156 at slac @xcite and apollon at desy @xcite ) .",
    "the lower part of the table refers to experiments under discussion for the more distant option of a possible polarized hera collider ( collider option @xcite , fixed target option @xcite ) which are bound to the uncertainties associated to what strategy will be eventually chosen for the future physics programme at hera in about five years from now .",
    "the purpose of this discussion session was , on one hand , to encourage theorists to review and clarify the theoretical basis for each experimental method and to argue in favour of , or against it . on the other hand",
    ", one was also hoping to hear about new arguments which could cast ( or remove ) serious doubts on ( from ) any straightforward or naive interpretation of some of these future experimental results .",
    "the discussion was organized by suggesting essentially three broad provocative questions which were partly answered , but which also generated new challenging queries as we will see now .",
    "this question came about , because some people were concerned by the fact that , perhaps , very different experiments may not measure the same physical quantity @xmath7 . here",
    "we are touching the general question of factorization / regularization scheme dependence , which also applies in the spin average case , to the determination of the unpolarized gluon distribution @xmath8 and , more generally , of any parton density . from the accurate measurement of the structure function @xmath9 at hera",
    ", one can extract indirectly the gluon density @xmath8 , via the @xmath10 evolution , which must be identical to the one obtained more directly , for instance , in the analysis of the prompt photon production data , in @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 collisions . of course",
    ", for a unique interpretation , this implies that in a phenomological analysis , in particular at the next - to - leading order , the coefficient functions and the parton densities are defined in a consistent scheme .",
    "one is usually choosing the modified minimal substraction scheme , the so - called @xmath13 scheme . from this point of view",
    "@xmath7 is exactly like any other parton density .",
    "however , it is important to stress that there is a major difference between @xmath7 and @xmath14 . in the operator product expansion , whereas the first moment of the quark polarization @xmath14 is associated to a twist - two gauge - invariant local operator , this is not the case for the first moment of @xmath7 .",
    "this important theoretical subtlety does not mean that @xmath7 is not a measurable physical quantity .",
    "in addition to the quark and gluon helicity components of the nucleon spin , it is also legitimate to think about possible contributions from the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "one can write down the following simple spin sum rule @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the sum of the quark ( antiquark ) helicity components .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that asymptotically the quark and gluon contributions , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are gauge - invariant and in the ratio 3@xmath21/16 , where @xmath21 is the number of active fermion flavors . however , this does hold at finite @xmath10 , so the knowledge of @xmath18 and @xmath7 at today or tomorrow accessible kinematics is not sufficient to speculate about the importance of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; there are suggestions on how to measure them , _",
    "e.g. _ by means of deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite .",
    "here we have heard comments on more general theoretical problems , in particular , on some tricky points concerning the models corresponding to the various processes indicated in the table , which are usually ignored to make life simpler . in the case of apollon ,",
    "the physical process is exclusive diffractive @xmath22 leptoproduction with a polarized target .",
    "it is claimed to be a promising way to get directly @xmath23 , according to a two - gluon exchange model @xcite .",
    "clearly , the first objection to be made to this simple result is the fact that it is a leading - order approximation and it might be spoiled by higher order corrections.they seem to be very hard to calculate and , in addition to several reservations which were mentioned , the discussion led to the conclusion that inclusive open charm , as proposed by compass , is certainly more reliable and therefore more desirable .",
    "we were told that , as a general rule , `` the more exclusive is a process , the less theorists understand it ! '' . on the other hand",
    ", one can argue , and this was done , that if exclusive diffractive @xmath22 leptoproduction works in the unpolarized case , this is a good enough reason to expect it to work in the polarized case . concerning compass",
    ", we can ask whether there are hidden theoretical problems .",
    "one of them is soft gluon radiation , which is not yet solved but is on the way and should be easier since we are dealing with almost real photons .",
    "large corrections might be found , like for example , in the case of heavy quark pair production in polarized photon - photon collisions @xcite .",
    "perhaps one should also worry about collinearity and the fact that a reliable qcd prediction requires each of the heavy quarks to be produced with a significant scattering angle , but this did not appear to be a serious problem .",
    "if we now turn to rhic , the golden channel is inclusive prompt photon production .",
    "the question of the isolation cut is an important one , but it is an experimental problem .",
    "remember that the interpretation of this process at high energy is not as clear as it might appear .",
    "for example in the case of the cross section from the recent fnal data by e706 , a standard nlo qcd description fails and one needs to take into account some sizeable intrinsic @xmath24 effects .",
    "we hope that this unpleasant feature will drop out in spin asymmetries , which are cross section ratios .",
    "one can also ask how much we can trust the extrapolation to rhic energy , of the present determination of the quark polarizations , which enter in the extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "the answer to this is that rhic will also measure @xmath25 independently .",
    "the answers to this speculative question reflected several attitudes , which were expressed in the discussion .",
    "first , it was claimed that this result would be a triumph for chiral bag models and here one can recall , in particular , the skyrme model in which the nucleon corresponds to a soliton solution of a chiral lagrangian @xcite , where one expects @xmath27 and therefore @xmath28 .",
    "however , present data seems to exclude @xmath29 , but the need for a measurement of the orbital angular momentum component was stressed once more . clearly @xmath26 would not be a catastrophy and one should remember that present data is not inconsistent with the so - called `` chihuahua @xmath7''@xcite .",
    "a small @xmath7 is certainly less unpleasant than a very large one , which would create a real embarrassment .",
    "finally , one should not forget the importance of the @xmath10 evolution since , if one finds @xmath30 at two different @xmath10 values , we would have to throw away perturbative qcd .",
    "+      we thank a.  brll , g.  bunce , s.  forte , r.l .",

    "we are greatful to a.  deshpande and v.  hughes for their kind permission to further develop their table of experiments aiming at measuring @xmath0 in the future , which was originally developed for a similar discussion session during the 1996 amsterdam spin conference @xcite .",
