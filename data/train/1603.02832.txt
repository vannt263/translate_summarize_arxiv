    "previously both phenomena have been addressed to a deconfinement transition .",

    "phsd incorporates explicit partonic degrees - of - freedom in terms of strongly interacting quasiparticles ( quarks and gluons ) in line with an equation - of - state from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) as well as dynamical hadronization and hadronic elastic and inelastic collisions in the final reaction phase .",
    "we recall that in the phsd / hsd , the high energy inelastic hadron - hadron collisions in the hadronic phase are described by the fritiof model @xcite , where two incoming nucleons emerge the reaction as two excited color singlet states , i.e. strings. the production probability @xmath1 of massive @xmath2 or @xmath3 pairs is suppressed in comparison to light flavor production ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) according to the schwinger - like formula @xcite , i.e. @xmath6 with @xmath7  gev@xmath8 denoting the string tension and @xmath9 the appropriate ( dressed ) strange and light quark masses . inserting the constituent ( dressed ) quark masses @xmath10",
    "gev and @xmath11 gev in the vacuum a value of @xmath12 is obtained from eq.(1 ) .",
    "this ratio is expected to be different in a nuclear medium and actually should depend on the in - medium quark condensate @xmath13 .      as it is well known the scalar quark condensate @xmath13 is viewed as an order parameter for the restoration of chiral symmetry at high baryon density and temperature . a reasonable estimate for the quark scalar condensate in dynamical calculations",
    "has been suggested by friman et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16-commutator of the relevant mesons @xmath17 and @xmath18 the scalar nucleon density .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 denotes the vacuum condensate , @xmath20 45 mev is the pion - nucleon @xmath21-term , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the pion decay constant and pion mass , respectively .",
    "the basic assumption now is that the strange and light quark masses in the hadronic medium drop both in line with the ratio ( [ condens2 ] ) , @xmath24 using @xmath25 100 mev and @xmath26 mev for the bare quark masses while the vacuum ( dressed ) masses are @xmath27 500 mev and @xmath28 mev , respectively .",
    "incorporating the effective masses ( [ mss ] ) into the probability ( [ schwinger ] ) , we can determine the effects of csr in the production of hadrons by string fragmentation . in order to illustrate our findings we show the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath29 at midrapidity from 5% central a+a collisions in fig .",

    "when comparing the results from the extended phsd approach for the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath29 from the different scenarios we see in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the results from phsd fail to describe the data in the conventional scenario @xcite without incorporating the csr .",
    "especially , the rise of the @xmath0 ratio at low invariant energies follows closely the experimental excitation function when including chiral symmetry restoration in the string decay .",
    "nevertheless , the drop in this ratio again is due to deconfinement since there is no longer any hadronic string decay in a partonic medium at higher energies .",
    "accordingly , the experimental horn in the excitation function is caused by chiral symmetry restoration but also deconfinement is essential to observe a maximum in the @xmath0 ratio .",

    "<S> we study the production of hadrons in nucleus - nucleus collisions within the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach that is extended to incorporate essentials aspects of chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) in the hadronic sector ( via the schwinger mechanism ) on top of the deconfinement phase transition as implemented in phsd . </S>",
    "<S> the essential impact of csr is found in the schwinger mechanism ( for string decay ) which fixes the ratio of strange to light quark production in the hadronic medium . </S>",
    "<S> our studies provide a microscopic explanation for the maximum in the @xmath0 ratio at about 30 a gev which only shows up if in addition to csr a deconfinement transition to partonic degrees - of - freedom is incorporated in the reaction dynamics . </S>"
