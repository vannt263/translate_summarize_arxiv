    "<S> it is obvious that the vector tetraquark state has many novel features which are of phenomenological importance and have many observable consequence , one can consult refs.@xcite for details . in this letter , we focus on its substructure and mass , and take the point of view that the vector meson @xmath0 with the isospin @xmath18 be a tetraquark state , calculate the value of its mass in the framework of the qcd sum rules approach @xcite .    in the following , we write down the interpolating current for the vector meson @xmath0 , @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are color indices and </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21 is the charge conjugation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the constituents @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the scalar diquarks ( @xmath24 ) with the @xmath25 , they belong to the antitriplet @xmath26 representation of the color @xmath27 group and can cluster together to form the scalar - scalar ( @xmath28 ) type diquark pairs to give the correct spin and parity of the vector mesons @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive interaction of one - gluon exchange favors the formation of diquarks in the color antitriplet @xmath30 , flavor antitriplet @xmath31 and spin singlet @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton induced force results in strong attraction in the scalar diquark channels and strong repulsion in the pseudoscalar diquark ( @xmath33 ) channels , we prefer the @xmath28 type interpolating currents to the @xmath34 type interpolating currents if the instantons manifest themselves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strong attractions between the scalar diquark states @xmath24 and @xmath35 in @xmath36-wave may result in a nonet manifested below @xmath37 , while the conventional @xmath38 @xmath39 nonet would have masses about @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the additional @xmath1-wave between the @xmath24 and @xmath35 can lead to the negative parity and much higher mass than @xmath37 , for example , the contribution from the @xmath1-wave is about @xmath41 in the isgur - karl model @xcite , we introduce the relative @xmath1-wave through the @xmath42 between the @xmath24 and @xmath35 . if we take the scalar diquark mass @xmath43 from lattice qcd as the input parameter @xcite , the mass of vector tetraquark is about @xmath44 , our numerical result @xmath2 confirms this naive analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there are large uncertainties about the masses of the colored diquarks , for more literatures and detailed discussions about this subject , one can consult ref.@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we derive the sum rules with the tensor structure @xmath49 , for the scalar meson , one can use the scalar interpolating currents as the ideal choice rather than the vector current @xmath50 @xcite .    according to the basic assumption of the current - hadron duality in the qcd sum rules approach @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we insert a complete series of intermediate states satisfying the unitarity principle with the same quantum numbers as the current operator @xmath50 into the correlation function in eq.(2 ) to obtain the hadronic representation . isolating the ground state contribution from the pole term of the vector tetraquark state </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the result , @xmath51 where the following definition has been used , @xmath52 the @xmath53 is the polarization vector of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have not shown the contributions from the higher resonances and continuum states explicitly for simplicity .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the operator product expansion in the deep euclidean space - time region is straightforward and tedious , technical details are neglected for simplicity . in this letter </S>",

    "<S> , we take the assumption of the vacuum saturation for the high dimension vacuum condensates , they are always factorized to lower condensates with the vacuum saturation in the qcd sum rules approach , the factorization works well in the large @xmath58 limit . </S>",
    "<S> once the analytical result is obtained , then we can take the current - hadron duality below the threshold @xmath59 and perform the borel transformation with respect to the variable @xmath60 , finally we obtain the following sum rule , @xmath61 @xmath62 here the @xmath59 is the threshold parameter . differentiate the above sum rule with respect to the variable @xmath63 , then eliminate the quantity @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath65 it is easy to perform the @xmath66 integral in eqs.(6 - 7 ) , we prefer this form for simplicity .    the input parameters are taken as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",

    "<S> the borel parameter @xmath78 is chosen to be @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the contributions from the high resonances and continuum states can be suppressed , furthermore , in this region , the mass from the sum rule is rather stable , which is shown in fig.1 . for detailed discussions about the criterion of choosing the borel parameter @xmath78 and threshold parameter @xmath59 for the multiquark states </S>",

    "<S> the contribution from the perturbative term is about @xmath82 , the dominating contribution comes from the term @xmath83 , about @xmath84 , the other terms are of minor importance , we can expect the convergence of the operator product expansion .     with the borel parameter @xmath78 for the central values of the condensates . </S>",

    "<S> is taken as an @xmath36-wave @xmath88-@xmath89 molecular state , the large width of the @xmath0 is taken into account by the large width of the @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> if the negative bound energy of the molecular state is large enough , the mixing can pull the mass down significantly . in the tetraquark scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the dominant decay modes of the @xmath91 are @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 which are ozi - allowed , not the @xmath95 which is ozi - forbidden @xcite . in the @xmath88-@xmath89 molecular scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the decay mode @xmath96 has much larger branching ratio than the decay mode @xmath97 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether or not there exist the resonant structure in the decay @xmath98 is of great importance for understanding the structure of the @xmath0 .    in this letter </S>",
