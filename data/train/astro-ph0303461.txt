    "almost 30 years ago joeveer ( @xcite ) found the dispersion of vertical coordinates ( @xmath9 ) of galactic classical cepheids to vary nonmonotonically with age ( inferred from period ) in a wavelike pattern .",
    "he interpreted these oscillations as a manifestation of the fact that each subpopulation of coeval cepheids is not in vertical virial equilibrium , i.e. , that the mean initial ( vertical ) velocities and coordinates of stars are not perfectly balanced .",
    "this causes the stars at a certain galactocentric distance to recede from and approach the galactic plane in a correlated way with a period ( frequency ) determined by local mass density ( and therefore the same for all stars at a given distance from the galactic center ) .",
    "joeveer ( @xcite ) used the period of vertical oscillations of galactic cepheids thus determined to estimate the local mass density in the solar neighborhood .    here",
    "we analyze the evolution of the vertical distribution of another class of young galactic - disk objects with accurately determinable ages - - open star clusters .",
    "however , unlike joeveer ( @xcite ) , we consider our primary task to be not to determine local mass density , which we believe to be much better constrained by recent kinematic analyses and therefore already known , but to use this already known density to discriminate between two evolutionary grids ( pols _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) that are identical in all respects except that one is computed with and another without the allowance for convective overshooting ( these two grids , naturally , yield different cluster ages and , consequently , different periods of vertical oscillations of the cluster population ) .",
    "consider an open cluster located in the vicinity of the galactic plane . if the cluster has a close - to - circular velocity in the galactic plane and small vertical velocity , its vertical motion is , to a good approximation , decoupled from the motion parallel to the galactic plane and obeys the following equation : @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , king @xcite ) , where @xmath11 ( = 2@xmath12 ) is the frequency ( and @xmath13 , the period ) of vertical oscillations determined by local mass density and rotation- curve parameters via the poisson equation : @xmath14 the sum of the last two terms in the left - hand side of the above equation can be easily expressed in terms of the local values of oort s constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 and shown to be negligible compared to @xmath18 .",
    "young objects are close to the galactic plane and therefore for clusters located within a narrow interval of galactocentric distances @xmath19 and the general solution to equation ( 1 )  harmonic oscillations with frequency @xmath11  has the following form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the initial vertical coordinate and vertical velocity component , respectively .",
    "it can be easily shown that : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 it thus follows that by analyzing the dependence of * observed * @xmath26 on age @xmath27 * computed in terms of a certain evolutionary grid * ) we can infer four very interesting parameters .",
    "first , the period @xmath2 of vertical oscillations ( e.g. , by power - spectrum analysis as is usually done in variable - star research ) and the * local mass density @xmath28 * it implies via poisson equation . second and third , the initial dispersion of * vertical coordinates ( @xmath29 ) * and * vertical velocity components ( @xmath30)*. and , fourth , the * correlation coefficient @xmath31 * between the initial vertical coordinate and vertical velocity . and",
    ", finally , by comparing the local mass densities @xmath28 thus inferred with the local mass density values based on recent analyses of stellar kinematics we can discriminate between * different evolutionary grids * which , naturally , yield different individual cluster ages , and , consequently , different periods @xmath2 .",
    "our initial sample consisted of the catalog of 203 young open clusters with heliocentric distances and ages determined in a homogeneous way from published @xmath32 photoelectric or ccd photometry ( dambis @xcite ) using kholopov s ( @xcite ) empiric zams and isochrones by maeder & meynet ( @xcite ) .",
    "since one of the principal aims of this work is to choose between stellar models with and without convective overshooting , we first converted our cluster ages to two age scales determined by the evolutionary grids of pols ( @xcite ) computed with and without overshooting .",
    "figure  1 shows the variation of the sliding dispersion @xmath33 as a function of mean age @xmath27 for clusters located within the galactocentric distance interval from @xmath0 - 1 kpc to @xmath0 + 1 kpc ( @xmath0 = 7.5 kpc ( see , e.g. , dambis @xcite and dambis & rastorguev @xcite ) is the galactocentric distance of the sun ) computed in terms of the evolutionary grid of pols et al .",
    "( @xcite ) without overshooting .",
    "figure  2 shows the corresponding periodogram .",
    "figures  3 and 4 show the corresponding plots for the case where cluster ages are computed in terms of the evolutionary grids of of pols _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) with overshooting .",
    "the inferred parameters @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath2 , and @xmath28 ( computed assuming that @xmath15 = + 17.0  km / s / kpc and @xmath16 = -11.7  km / s / kpc - rastorguev _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) ; note that adopting a different pair of reasonable values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 based on observations has little effect on the final result ",
    "e.g. , @xmath28 changes by only about 3% if we adopt flat rotation curve with @xmath36 = 0 ) .",
    "figure  5 compares our local mass density values computed in terms of two evolutionary grids with recent estimates based on the analysis of local stellar kinematics and the estimate of the local density of visible mass ( holmberg & flynn @xcite ) .",
    "it is immediately evident from this figure that * strong overshooting should be ruled out * for stars in young clusters : the local mass density @xmath37 implied by the corresponding grid is inconsistent not only with the total ( dynamic ) mass density of @xmath38 ( holmberg & flynn @xcite ) , but even with the density of visible matter @xmath39 ( ibid ) .",
    "given that all known departures from standard models of stellar evolution ( e.g. , mass loss , overshooting ) slow down the rate of evolution and , consequently increase the ages and times scales based on these ages , the results summarized in table  1 lead us to conclude that the local mass density value inferred in terms of evolutionary grids without overshooting should be considered as an upper limit for this parameter .",
    "it thus follows that    @xmath40 .",
    "given the estimate of local density of visible mass ( @xmath41 ) mentioned above and the upper limit for the total local mass density just obtained , we find that the local density of dark mass can not exceed @xmath42      two conclusions concerning star formation can be drawn from figs  1 and 3 and table  1 .",
    "first , the population of open clusters at the time of birth is overheated ( i.e. , has excess kinetic energy ) in the vertical direction : one can see that the layer of newly - born clusters expands immediately after age zero . and second",
    ", there is strong positive correlation ( with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 ) between the initial vertical coordinates of newly - born clusters and the initial vertical velocities .",
