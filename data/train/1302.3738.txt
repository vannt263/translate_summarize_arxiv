    "in this paper we study the free gamma distributions , i.e. , the images of the classical gamma distributions under the bijection between the classes of infinitely divisible measures in classical and free probability , respectively , introduced by bercovici and pata ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , for any positive number @xmath0 the free gamma distribution @xmath1 with parameter @xmath0 is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bercovici - pata bijection ( see section  [ prelim ] ) and @xmath5 is the classical gamma distribution with parameter @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath6 for any borel set @xmath7 in @xmath8",
    ".    the classical gamma distributions form perhaps the simplest class of selfdecomposable measures on @xmath8 which are not stable ( see section  [ prelim ] ) . since @xmath4 preserves the notions of stability and selfdecomposability ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the measures @xmath1",
    "are thus of interest as ( the simplest ? ) examples of non - stable selfdecomposable measures with respect to free ( additive ) convolution .",
    "of particular interest is the free @xmath9-distribution @xmath10 , which ( up to scaling by 2 ) equals the measure @xmath11 .",
    "apart from the general importance of the @xmath9-distribution in classical probability , this is mainly due to the fact that the square of the semi - circle distribution ( the analog of the gaussian distribution in free probability ) equals the free poisson distribution ( the image of the classical poisson law by @xmath4 ) as observed e.g.in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath4 is injective , the relationship between the gaussian and the @xmath9-distribution thus breaks down in free probability , and from that point of view it is of some interest to identify further the measure @xmath10 .    in an appendix to the paper @xcite p.  biane studied the freely stable distributions and established their absolute continuity ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) as well as the main features of their densities ; in particular analyticity and unimodality . applying the same method as biane ( based on stieltjes inversion ) we establish in the present paper that the free gamma distributions @xmath1 are absolutely continuous with analytic densities , and that they have supports in the form @xmath12 for some strictly positive number @xmath13 , which increases ( strictly ) with @xmath0 and tends to 0 and @xmath14 as @xmath0 goes to @xmath15 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we derive an ( implicit ) expression for the density @xmath16 of @xmath1 in the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a strictly increasing function given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a positive constant such that @xmath21 .",
    "moreover @xmath22 is a function essentially defined by the condition : @xmath23\\in\\r,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the cauchy ( or stieltjes ) transform of a probability measure @xmath25 on @xmath8 ( see formula below ) .",
    "this condition emerges naturally from the method of stieltjes inversion in combination with the key formula : @xmath26 which holds for all @xmath27 in @xmath28 satisfying that @xmath29 .",
    "the passage from to via stieltjes inversion depends heavily on a fundamental result of bercovici and voiculescu , which we state in lemma  [ bv key lemma ] below for the readers convenience .    by careful studies of the functions @xmath30 , @xmath18 and the right hand side of ,",
    "we derive some main features of the density @xmath31 , e.g.  analyticity , unimodality and the asymptotic behavior : @xmath32 in particular it follows that @xmath33 has moments of all orders , which is in concordance with the results of benaych - george in @xcite .",
    "we study also the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1 as @xmath34 , and we prove that the measures @xmath35 converge to the measure @xmath36 in moments and in the sense of point - wise convergence of the densities : @xmath37    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ prelim ] we collect background material on infinite divisibility , the bercovici - pata bijection and stieltjes inversion . in section  [ abs cont ]",
    "we establish absolute continuity of @xmath1 and prove the expression for the density . in section  [ sec asympt opf ]",

    "we prove that @xmath1 is unimodal , and in the final section  [ sec_alpha_mod_0 ] we study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1 as @xmath34 .",
    "the main results in sections  [ abs cont]-[sec_alpha_mod_0 ] depend in part on some basic properties of the functions @xmath30 and @xmath18 , the proofs of which are ( not surprisingly ) rather technical . in order to maintain a steady flow in the paper ,",

    "specifically @xmath63 may be chosen in the form : @xmath67 for suitable positive numbers @xmath46 and @xmath68 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) that @xmath61 constitutes the free analog of @xmath69 in the sense that it linearizes free convolution : @xmath70 for all probability measures @xmath25 and @xmath51 on @xmath8 and all @xmath27 in a region where all three transforms are defined .",
    "the results in @xcite are presented in terms of a variant , @xmath71 , of @xmath61 , which is often referred to as the voiculescu transform , and which is again a variant of the @xmath63-transform @xmath72 introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relationship is the following : @xmath73 for all @xmath27 in a region @xmath74 as above .",
    "in @xcite it was proved additionally that @xmath75 , if and only if there exists @xmath47 in @xmath76 , @xmath46 in @xmath8 and a lvy measure @xmath48 , such that @xmath61 has the _ free lvy - khintchine representation _ : @xmath77}(t)\\big ) \\",

    "in particular it follows for @xmath25 in @xmath56 that @xmath61 can be extended to an analytic map ( also denoted @xmath61 ) defined on all of @xmath64 .",
    "the triplet @xmath50 is uniquely determined and is called the _ free characteristic triplet _ for @xmath25 .    it was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.12 ) that any measure @xmath51 in @xmath56 has at most one atom .",
    "in fact the proof of that proposition reveals that an atom @xmath47 for @xmath51 is necessarily equal to the non - tangential limit of @xmath78 as @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath81 has a non - tangential limit @xmath82 at 0 , if for any positive number @xmath83 we have that @xmath84 in order to derive non - tangential limits , the following lemma ( lemma  5.11 in @xcite ) is extremely useful :    [ bv key lemma ] let @xmath85 be an analytic function , and let @xmath86 be a curve in @xmath28 which approaches 0 non - tangentially .",
    "if @xmath87 , then @xmath88 for any positive number @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath89 has non - tangential limit @xmath82 at @xmath15 .      in @xcite bercovici and pata introduced a bijection @xmath4 between the two classes @xmath43 and @xmath56 , which may formally be defined as the mapping sending a measure @xmath25 from @xmath43 with characteristic triplet @xmath50 onto the measure @xmath90 in @xmath56 with _ free _ characteristic triplet @xmath50 .",
    "it is then obvious that @xmath4 is a bijection , and it turns out that @xmath4 further enjoys the following properties ( see @xcite and @xcite ) :    1 .   if @xmath91 , then @xmath92 .",
