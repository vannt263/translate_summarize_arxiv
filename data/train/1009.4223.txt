    "one - dimensional systems show many interesting properties like charge fractionalization and separation of charge excitations from spin excitations .",
    "there is experimental evidence for these properties in various systems @xcite .",
    "recent progress in trapping and cooling of cold atoms , has made it possible to study one - dimensional systems and their properties in both fermions and bosons  @xcite .",
    "one of the primary tools in measuring properties of cold atoms are interference experiments .",
    "surprisingly , it has been shown that interfering two independently created bose einstein condensates ( e.g. by releasing the confining potential and letting them expand and overlap ) gives rise to spatially periodic patterns in each experimental shot . as there is no well defined phase between the two condensates ,",
    "the maxima and minima of the pattern are at different positions in each shot , so that the average over many shots , corresponding to a quantum - mechanical ensemble average @xmath0 , contains no interference fringes .",
    "the key to this effect is that we can decompose the state of the two condensates , each containing a definite number of particles , into a superposition of states of well defined relative phases .",
    "measuring the interference pattern collapses the wavefunction of the combined system to a state with definite phase , and thus produces a periodic pattern . to theoretically study this effect , we need to study the density - density correlation function @xmath1 instead of the average density , since the quantum mechanical average of the density formed in interference experiments samples all possible relative phases and thus hides the interference pattern .",
    "the above arguments hold true even for an interfering pair of one - dimensional systems , with one important modification : as there is no long range order , the maxima formed in the interference pattern are wavy lines instead of straight lines .",
    "this waviness contains information about the correlation function within each 1d system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an experimental approach to create and directly probe excitations in one - dimensional ultracold atom systems of both bosons and fermions .",
    "in particular , for systems composed of mixtures of two species , our method allows us to see separation to spin and charge modes .",
    "our approach is to start with a pair of one - dimensional systems , parametrically drive excitations by temporally periodic modulation of the particle particle interaction strength , and finally analyze the interference pattern .",
    "experiments involving parametric driving to create excitations in one - dimensional fermionic gases have recently been proposed in refs @xcite . in this work , in addition to fermionic gases , we study also bosonic gases , which are of experimental interest .        in interference experiments with one - dimensional systems of cold atoms ,",
    "the gases are released from their traps and allowed to expand .",
    "we label the longitudinal direction as the @xmath2 the axis , and the two systems lie in the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . due to the strong transverse confinement ,",
    "when released from their traps , the atoms expand mainly in the transverse directions .",
    "therefore , we shall neglect the motion of atoms in the longitudinal direction during the expansion .",
    "once the gases have expanded to a size much larger than the initial distance @xmath4 between the two systems , an absorption image is taken .",
    "we neglect the slowly varying envelope and the expectation value of the density in case of independently created quasicondensates is a constant , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the line density of each quasicondensate .",
    "the density - density correlations function , however , contains an oscillating term at wave vector @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the particle mass , @xmath9 the time of expansion : @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the upper ( lower ) sign applies to bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the particle annihilation operator in either of the equivalent initial 1d systems . to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we have neglected the motion of atoms along the longitudinal direction during expansion ; assumed that the two systems are initially identical and independent ; assumed large expansion times ( e.g. the size of the overlapping clouds is much larger than their initial separation @xmath4 ) .",
    "see appendix [ appendix1 ] ; ref  @xcite contains a more detailed discussion .",
    "typically , experimental data is analyzed by looking at the the integrated density - density correlation function  @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the length of the integration , and the interference amplitude @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "one can now define the interference contrast @xmath19 , which decays as the integration length @xmath16 is increased , encoding the decay of the correlation functions in the one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "our approach is to study the interference pattern of one - dimensional gases that have been parametrically driven out of equilibrium .",
    "the driving is done by a temporally periodic change of interaction strength for a certain time @xmath20 before the gases are released from their traps . to extract information from the interference pattern , we suggest to take the fourier transform along the z - axis , and then study correlations for that fourier transform .",
    "we define @xmath21 and then consider the quantity @xmath22 which is given by @xmath23 thus , by fourier transforming the interference pattern , one can obtain the fourier transform of the correlation function of a single 1d gas , @xmath24 the quantity @xmath25 is also a function of the total driving time @xmath20 ( we have suppressed this time argument @xmath20 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the above equations ) .",
    "this analysis can in principle be done for fermions and bosons .",
    "our main results are : ( 1 ) we find that parametric drive at frequency @xmath28 creates pairs of excitations with total momentum zero .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath29 shows a resonance peak at the wave vector corresponding to half the driving frequency , @xmath30 ( and , in principle , associated multiples ) , where @xmath31 is the sound velocity of the corresponding mode . such an analysis can be used to find the sound velocity of the 1d bose system .",
    "( 2 ) for a two component bose system , we find two primary peaks corresponding to  spin \" and  charge \" velocity .",
    "( 3 ) similarly one could analyze an interference pattern of a driven 1d system of two component fermions , where one expects two peaks corresponding to spin and charge excitations . for fermions , however , there are some complications due to the rapid decay of the correlation functions , which we will address in section  [ spincharge ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ drivingsqueezing ] we introduce the formalism and describe the relation between a driven 1d gas and a driven simple harmonic oscillator . in section  [ detecting ] we calculate the correlation functions of driven systems and show how information about the driving can be extracted from the interference pattern . in section  [ spincharge ]",
    "we address the problem of observing spin charge separation for fermionic 1d systems .",
    "one - dimensional systems of interacting bosons or fermions can in general be described by hamiltonian @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the interaction strength , and @xmath34 creates a particle at point @xmath2 .",
    "low energy excitations may in turn be described by the luttinger liquid hamiltonian which in momentum space is given by a sum of harmonic oscillators @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are conjugate fields : @xmath38=i\\delta_{q , -q^\\prime}$ ] , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the luttinger parameters , @xmath40 corresponds to the sound velocity , and @xmath39 is a dimensionless parameter . for a finite system of length @xmath41",
    "we quantize the momentum @xmath42 .",
    "we shall first consider the case of spinless bosons and then generalize to a two component bose mixture and fermions with spin .",
    "for a weakly interacting one component bose system ( @xmath43 ) the luttinger parameters are given by @xmath44 where @xmath6 is the 1d line density , and g is the interaction parameter , related to the three dimensional scattering length @xmath45 through @xmath46  @xcite , where @xmath47 is the transverse trapping frequency .",
    "the relation between the physical boson creation operator and the luttinger fields is given by @xmath48 and the correlation function in the ground state has a power law decay @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a short distance cutoff .",
    "let us now assume that there are two species of bosons ( e.g. two hyperfine states or two different atoms ) , labelled @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we further assume that the interaction between two atoms of the species labelled up and the one between two atoms of the species down are the same , @xmath53 , a condition that can be realized in experiments using hyperfine states @xmath54 and @xmath55 of @xmath56rb @xcite .",
    "we label @xmath57 the interaction strength between different species . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian separates into a  charge \" part with @xmath58 and  spin \" part with @xmath59 .",

    ". in the case of ultracold atomic gases , two fermions of the same species can not interact via s - wave scattering ( @xmath65 ) . in the following we assume @xmath66-interactions and denote by @xmath67 the interaction constant between two fermions of opposite spin .",

    "the fields which decouple the hamiltonians in @xmath68 and @xmath75 are given by @xmath76 and same for @xmath77 , which enters in the luttinger liquid hamiltonian as @xmath78 .",
    "the spin part of the hamiltionan has an additional sine gordon term , arising from backscattering between fermions with opposite spin ( @xmath79 term ) .",
    "however , this term renormalizes to zero  @xcite if @xmath80 ( repulsive interactions ) , otherwise it creates a gap in the spectrum of the spin hamiltonan . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on repulsive interactions and the sine - gordon term is not relevant .",

    "we have studied interference of parametrically driven one - dimensional systems of both bosonic and fermionic ultracold systems , and found that the interference pattern contains information about the excitations driven into the systems . for two component systems",
    "two kinds of excitations are driven on resonance : those corresponding to charge velocity , and those corresponding to spin velocity .",
