    "the fundamental limit on the speed of particles implied by special relativity has long thought to be a limit to how humans can explore the cosmos .",

    "only a small number of papers have examined the interactions of light with alcubierre warp bubbles @xcite , with detailed analysis only by @xcite .",
    "furthermore there has been almost no coverage in the literature of the interactions of massive particles with warp bubbles .",
    "@xcite investigate these interactions only briefly , discussing only the interaction between a warp bubble travelling at constant velocity and eulerian matter , that is matter stationary in the rest frame of the origin / destination of the ship .",
    "this paper fills this void , providing a detailed analysis of the interactions of null and massive particles with an alcubierre warp bubble at both constant and variable velocity , via the calculation of representative geodesics through alcubierre spacetime .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ background ]",
    "we introduce the alcubierre spacetime @xcite and discuss the main concerns regarding its validity that have been proposed . in section",
    "[ main ] we outline the variable velocity paths used and equations of motion before presenting our analysis for interactions with bubbles at constant velocity in [ section_constant ] .",

    "the alcubierre spacetime is asymptotically flat with the exception of the walls of a small spherical bubble surrounding supposedly a ship .",
    "the general idea behind the alcubierre warp drive is to choose an arbitrary path and deform spacetime in the immediate vicinity such that the path becomes a timelike freefall path i.e. a geodesic . since the ship is following a geodesic , the travellers experience no inertial effects .",
    "the alcubierre metric @xcite can be described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the shape function which determines the form of the bubble wall spacetime distortion , normalised to unit value at the centre of the bubble . in alcubierre s original paper",
    "it was proposed @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance from the ship , @xmath9 is the global velocity of the ship , and hence the bubble , and can be arbitrarily large , and r and @xmath10 are arbitrary parameters determining the radius of the warp bubble and the thickness of the bubble wall respectively . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "a qualitatively similar but mathematically more manageable equation was used , namely @xmath11 for @xmath12 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the global velocity is that as measured by eulerian observers , that is anyone in flat spacetime and in the rest frame of the origin / destination of the ship .",
    "it is straightforward to see from the line element that the form of global velocity is @xmath13 . from this definition of global velocity ,",
    "it is also straightforward to see from the line element , that @xmath14 for the travellers on the ship , where @xmath15 is proper time .",
    "thus the proper time of the eulerian observers and the travellers is the same , and hence no time dilation is experienced .",
    "alcubierre produced this solution by what is termed `` metric engineering '' , that is , stipulating the required spacetime geometry and solving for the necessary energy distribution .",
    "this method is problematic as it can result in seemingly unphysical solutions .",
    "as noted by alcubierre , the stress energy momentum tensor is negative for all observers , even when operating at arbitrarily low velocity @xcite .",
    "this implies a requirement of negative energy densities , which can only be achieved by exotic matter thus violating the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "this violation implies ability to create closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) and their associated problems .",
    "in addition to these issues , the alcubierre warp drive suffers from the tachyonic problem as described by @xcite .    to circumvent these problems , modifications the metric",
    "have been proposed , however any spacetime that permits apparent superluminal travel violates the weak and null energy conditions , and by extension opens the way for ctcs and their associated problems @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that even if these problems were viewed simply as engineering issues , there would still be critical problems due to semiclassical instability .",
    "the following analysis is restricted to the t - x plane , and thus @xmath16 simplifies to the signed distance from the ship @xmath17 .",
    "first we look at the interactions of null and massive particles with a bubble at constant velocity , then with a bubble on a one way trip , and finally with a bubble on a round trip .",
    "two types of variable velocity path are used in this paper .",

    ", the path more closely resembles a top hat .",

    "@xmath30      the energy of the particles at the ship and outside the bubble is calculated using @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the 4-velocity of the observer , and @xmath33 is the 4-momentum of the particle .",
    "for an eulerian observer at rest with respect to the @xmath34 coordinate system , the 4-velocity is @xmath35 ; interestingly we can show that for the traveller at the centre of the bubble the 4-velocity is also @xmath35@xcite .",
    "the redshift is then calculated using @xmath36 .",
    "thus the relative increase or decrease in particle energy is represented by the quantity @xmath37 which we define the blueshift . as this is calculated from the time component of the 4-velocity , it is also representative of the time dilation for massive particles when measured at by eulerian observers or observers on the ship .",
    "a useful question to ask is when the global velocity of the particle is larger than the global velocity of the ship . for null particles , we start with @xmath38 and rearrange to find @xmath39 .",
    "substituting into @xmath40 and solving for our shape function gives @xmath41 which defines two positions .",
    "we define the position on the side towards which the bubble is moving to be the front horizon and the other to be the rear horizon .",
    "notably , these positions are outside the bubble radius when @xmath42 and thus the horizons only exist while the ship is moving at superluminal velocity .    for massive particles ,",
    "this question is more difficult .",

    "this returns us to the same equation as for null particles , and thus the same equation for the horizons , but due to our assumption that the particle is interacting with the bubble from the front , this can only tell us about the front horizon .",

    "the light rays exit the bubble with the same frequency with which they enter it , however they are spatially displaced by a small distance in the direction of travel of the ship .",
    "the magnitude of the displacement is due to the time spent in the bubble and the bubble velocity , larger for longer time spent in the bubble and for larger ship velocity .",

    "when the initial particle velocity is zero , the particle passes through the bubble , which agrees with the result presented by @xcite .",
    "this is the path which takes the longest coordinate time to reach the ship and subsequently leave the rear of the bubble . of the paths that leave the bubble , no other path spends more coordinate time in the bubble and hence this path results in maximal spatial displacement .",
    "particles with negative initial velocity have a path between that of zero velocity particles and backward travelling light .",
    "the larger the magnitude of the negative velocity , the earlier the path diverges from that taken by zero velocity particles and the more closely the path approximates that taken by backward travelling light . as the magnitude of the negative velocity decreases , the path taken diverges from that taken by zero velocity particles later , but",

    "particles with non positive initial velocity pass through the bubble as for superluminal bubble interactions , but take longer to do so with the zero velocity path taking almost a magnitude longer than for the 5c bubble interaction .",
    "positive initial velocity particle paths are divided into paths which resemble that taken by forward travelling light and paths which we refer to as `` slow '' matter paths ; this division occurs at a velocity we define the critical velocity , @xmath56 .",
    "particles travelling at the critical velocity are the slowest particles which pass through the bubble from behind .",
    "this is similar to how zero velocity particles represent the slowest path which passes through the bubble from infront .",
    "these particles are the slowest in the sense that their velocity magnitude is the lowest , and they take the largest amount of coordinate time to pass through the bubble .",
    "as the velocity increases above the critical velocity , the path taken diverges from that of particles at the critical velocity earlier , more closely approximating the path taken by forward travelling light .    for particles with initial positive velocity lower than the critical velocity , there are two possibilities , either the velocity is above that of the bubble and hence the particle will catch up to the bubble from behind or the velocity is below that of the bubble and thus the particle will interact with the front of the bubble first as the bubble catches up to the particle . in the first case ,",
    "the particle is ejected from the bubble back out the rear with a reduced but still positive velocity below the ship velocity . for particles with initial velocity closer to the critical velocity , the path follows that of the critical velocity particles for longer , thus getting closer to the ship , before diverging and being ejected from the bubble . similarly in the second case , the particle is ejected out the front of the bubble with an increased velocity larger than the ship velocity . for particles with a smaller initial velocity , the path follows that of the zero velocity particles for longer , thus getting closer to the ship , before diverging and being ejected from the bubble .    while the particular results presented are for our choice of shape function only , we can generalise to any shape function consisting of expansion behind the ship and contraction infront of the ship .",
    "we found that particles truly at rest before entering the warp bubble come to rest when they reach a region of flat spacetime again ; the results presented suggest that this first occurs as the particle leaves the bubble , but infact it occurs upon reaching the flat spacetime region immediately surrounding the ship .",
    "our choice of shape function restricts this region to a single point and thus our use of numerical methods does not allow it to land directly on this point , instead the particle passes the ship as if it had a infinitesimal negative velocity .",
    "we found that while within regions of contracting space , the magnitude of the velocity of particles increases .",
    "this means that particles with negative velocity accelerate through the front half of the bubble , and that particles with positive velocity accelerate forwards away from the ship .",
    "thus any shape function of this form will result in particles with zero initial velocity coming to rest at the ship , separating the paths which pass through the bubble from those which do not .",
    "figure [ linear matter slow ] shows `` slow '' matter paths for a bubble velocity of 0.5 .",
    "the closer the initial velocity is to the bubble velocity , the closer the final velocity is to the bubble velocity .",
    "furthermore , there is a symmetry between the two interactions such that if a particle has initial velocity @xmath57 , then the bubble will catch up to the particle and eject it with a new velocity @xmath58 .",
    "if this particle were to catch up to another warp drive travelling at the same velocity ( and thus having the same critical velocity ) , then after entering the bubble it would be ejected out the rear with final velocity @xmath59 ; this symmetry is evident in figure [ linear matter slow ] .",
    "this symmetry is not evident in figure [ linear matter bubble sub ] as the final velocities obtained by the `` slow '' matter in figure [ linear matter bubble sub ] interacting from the front do not correspond to the initial velocities of the `` slow '' matter in figure [ linear matter bubble sub ] interacting from behind , and vice versa .",

    "the blueshift also increases with the particle velocity but the dependence on the ship velocity is much larger due to the restrictions on the particle velocity for reaching the ship .",

    "in addition , the blueshift is also unity whenever the particle velocity is 0 . when both the ship velocity and particle velocity are nonzero , increasing the particle velocity towards @xmath71 increases the observed blueshift , and similarly increasing the ship velocity increases the observed blueshift . as there is no bound on the ship velocity in the n@xmath60 region , the blueshift observed can be arbitrarily large .",

    "the blueshift for the `` slow '' matter is more complicated . in the p@xmath61 ,",
    "i.e. when a subluminal bubble catches up to particles , the blueshift increases without bound as the ship velocity approaches unity . as the particle velocity increases towards the ship velocity , the blueshift drops towards unity .",
    "the blueshifts for the p@xmath61 region are given by @xmath73    in the b@xmath61 region , i.e. when `` slow '' matter catches up to a subluminal bubble , there are two bounds to the blueshift .",
    "as the particle velocity approaches the ship velocity from above , the blueshift rises towards unity , whereas as the the particle velocity increases toward the critical velocity , the blueshift drops toward 0 .",
    "the blueshifts for the b@xmath61 region are given by @xmath74    technically the particles in the p@xmath60 can not leave the bubble , and so there is no value given for this region .",
    "however , the time component of the 4-velocity the particles in this region increases exponentially for the duration of the time they are caught in the bubble .",

    "as the bubble accelerates , the backward travelling light rays are released from the bubble with a spatial separation lower than that they had before entering the bubble . similarly during deceleration",
    "the backward travelling light rays are released from the bubble with a spatial separation lower than their initial spatial separation .",
    "these increases and decreases in spatial separation scale with the magnitude of the bubble acceleration and deceleration respectively .    as first glance",
    "these effects imply that the spatial separation of the light rays should be unchanged around the centre of the journey , however this does not occur in figure [ logistic light sup ] until around 3/4 of the way through the journey .",
    "the reason for this is that light rays take time to pass through the bubble , and thus would only appear to be unaffected by acceleration / deceleration if the magnitude of the effects of the acceleration and deceleration were equal . as the period of acceleration ( i.e. the first half of the journey ) is symmetric to the period of deceleration ( i.e. the second half of the journey ) on the one way trips in this chapter , the light rays which appear unaffected are those which reach the centre of the bubble at the midpoint of the journey",
    "this occurs for light rays which enter the bubble approximately 1/4 of the way through the journey and exit the bubble approximately 3/4 of the way through the journey , as is observed .",
    "the effects on the change in spatial separation can be explained in terms of the difference in the velocity of the bubble while the light rays are entering and leaving the bubble .",
    "figure [ logistic light sup ] shows that the rate which the backward travelling light rays enter the bubble is the same as the rate with which they leave the bubble .",

    "if the light is infront of the rear horizon , then it will asymptote towards the front horizon .",
    "as the position of the horizons is dependant on the bubble velocity , during periods of large acceleration , forward travelling light within the bubble can be overtaken by the rear horizon . as explained earlier ,",
    "the horizons only exist for superluminal bubble velocities , and thus upon the bubble velocity decreasing back to subluminal velocity , all the forward travelling light that was previously captured in the front horizon is released at once . due to the capture of forward travelling light , superluminally travelling bubbles",

    "additionally , the rear horizon only forms upon the ship reaching the speed of light , however , as the critical point applies to massive particles , it forms ( i.e. is inside the bubble ) earlier .",
    "the velocity of light is constant , so if the ship velocity is below the speed of light then the light eventually reaches the ship .",

    "the later the massive particles are overtaken by the critical point , the greater the reduction in the velocity of the massive particles ; this reduction can result in final velocities arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "similarly the later the massive particles ejected due to being below the critical velocity enter the bubble , the smaller the reduction in the final velocity of the massive particles . the combination of these two effects results in massive particles being released from the rear of the bubble with consistently decreasing velocity , which ranges from the initial velocity of the massive particles to arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "of the massive particles which are not overtaken by the critical point , only the first two to enter the bubble make it to the front horizon before the bubble decelerates below the speed of light and the horizon ceases to exist , and thus only the first two particles to enter the bubble obtain velocities close to unity .",
    "figure [ logistic matter sup front ] shows massive particles with velocity 0.1 interacting with a bubble decelerating from a superluminal velocity .",
    "this shows how during deceleration massive particles are ejected infront of the bubble at a range of velocities from the initial velocity of the massive particles up to arbitrarily close to the speed of light depending on how long the massive particles have been in the bubble .",

    "[ logistic matter bubble],width=298 ]    figure [ logistic matter bubble ] shows the path for massive particles which are spatially stationary and inside the bubble at the origin of the journey . as with light and massive particles discussed earlier ,",
    "the massive particles from the rear portion of the bubble are dropped off from the bubble with increasing spatial separation .",
    "as mentioned earlier , massive particles with zero initial velocity are unaffected by the bubble accelerating or decelerating , and thus upon being dropped off from the bubble they retain a zero velocity .",
    "massive particles in the front portion of the bubble are compressed inwards towards the ship , and massive particles immediately around the ship are largely unaffected .",
    "coordinate and the ordinate represents the @xmath28 coordinate .",
    "the aspect ratio is 1:1 such that light rays travel at @xmath48 in flat spacetime .",
    "the right panel is the same interaction with respect to the ship , thus the abscissa represents the distance with respect to the ship .",
    "the blue and red lines are forward and backward travelling light rays respectively , and the magenta and black lines represent the bubble walls and ship respectively .",
    "[ gaussian light],width=298 ]    figure [ gaussian light ] shows light interacting with a warp bubble on a superluminal round trip .",
    "the first part of the trip is very similar to the one way trip shown in figure [ logistic light sup ] , with a buildup of forward travelling light at a front horizon and the spreading out and bunching up of backward travelling light rays during the acceleration and deceleration respectively .",
    "the second half of the trip is similar to what a one way trip in the opposite direction would look like , with light travelling in the same direction as the ship being captured and light travelling in the opposite direction to the ship passing through the bubble and being bunched up during deceleration at the origin of the trip .",
    "a new feature visible is the formation of a front horizon during the second half of the journey with light asymptoting towards it from both sides for much longer than for a normal one way trip , due to the buildup of light in the bubble from the first half of the journey . in both halves of the trip ,",
    "when the bubble velocity dropped below the speed of light , any light that had been captured was released as a burst .",
    "the path of light is mainly included as reference for the massive particle paths .",
    "coordinate and the ordinate represents the @xmath28 coordinate .",
    "the aspect ratio is 1:1 such that light rays travel at @xmath48 in flat spacetime .",
    "the right panel is the same interaction with respect to the ship , thus the abscissa represents the distance with respect to the ship .",
    "the magenta and black lines represent the bubble walls and ship respectively .",
    "[ gaussian 0],width=298 ]    figure [ gaussian 0 ] shows the same situation as for light for spatially stationary massive particles .",
    "figure [ gaussian 0 ] shows that the longer the massive particles are inside the bubble , the closer they get to the ship .",
    "this is to be expected , as earlier we showed that massive particles with zero initial velocity would eventually pass through a bubble at constant velocity , however this journey is not long enough to allow this to happen .",
    "before the massive particles can pass all the way through the bubble , the bubble begins the return journey .",
    "since the path is symmetric , and the acceleration and deceleration of the bubble has no effect on massive particles with zero initial velocity , as was mentioned earlier , the massive particles leave the bubble at the same spatial positions as they entered the bubble with no change in their velocity .",
    "if the journey had been long enough to allow the massive particles to pass through the bubble , any displacement incurred due to passing through the bubble on the first part of the journey would be offset by a corresponding displacement incurred while passing back through the bubble on the second part of the journey .",
    "thus any symmetric path would leave massive particles with zero initial velocity unperturbed .     for massive particles with nonzero initial velocity .",
    "the particles in the upper left panel have velocity -0.001 , the upper right -0.01 , the lower left 0.001 and the lower right 0.01.[gaussian non0],width=298 ]    as with the rest of the report , we expect massive particles with nonzero velocity to behave in a similar manner to light , more closely approximating the behaviour of light as the initial velocity of the massive particles approaches that of light .",
    "figure [ gaussian non0 ] shows the same situation for massive particles with small and large negative and positive initial velocities .",
    "when they leave the bubble again they are spatially displaced in the direction of their initial velocity .",
    "thus after the ship has made the round trip , negative velocity particles are shifted towards the origin of the trip in line with how early in the trip the bubble picks them up .",
    "this effect could never shift them all to the origin , as it can be thought of as a stretch function with the limiting value of the origin of the trip , no amount of stretching will remove all the negative velocity particles .",
    "positive velocity particles are captured and asymptote toward the front horizon .",
    "the closer the massive particles approach the front horizon , the larger their velocity upon leaving the bubble .",
    "this results in a large void between the origin of the journey and part way towards the furthest point away from the origin reached by the bubble , which contains almost none of the massive particles in question . as with the one way trips discussed earlier",
    ", a very small amount of massive particles with greatly reduced velocity would be sparsely distributed through this region .",
    "the magnitude of these effects scale with the initial velocity of the particles and the time spent in the bubble , thus particles picked up by the bubble earlier also receive a larger effect .",
    "we have examined the paths of null and massive particles with a range of initial velocities from -@xmath1 to @xmath1 interacting with an alcubierre warp bubble travelling at a range of globally subluminal and superluminal velocities on both constant and variable velocity paths .",
    "the key results for null particles match what would be expected of massive test particles travelling at @xmath77 . when interacting with a constant velocity warp bubble , particles in the regions n@xmath60 , n@xmath61 , and b@xmath60 are blueshifted by @xmath78 at the ship , but exit the opposite side of the bubble with their original velocity and energy .",
    "particles in the regions p@xmath61 and b@xmath61 are accelerated and decelerated respectively and ejected out the same side of the bubble that they entered such that there is a bijective map between the regions for the initial and final particle velocity and energy of the particle when interacting with a warp bubble .",
    "the blueshift for particle interactions in the p@xmath61 and b@xmath61regions are given by @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "particles in the p@xmath60 region obtain extremely high blueshifts and become  time locked \" for the duration of their time in the bubble , experiencing very little proper time between entering and eventually leaving the bubble .",
    "when interacting with an accelerating bubble , any particles within the bubble at the time receive a velocity boost that increases or decreases the magnitude of their velocity if the particle is moving towards the front or rear of the bubble respectively .",
    "if the bubble is decelerating , the opposite effect is observed .",
    "thus eulerian matter is unaffected by bubble accelerations / decelerations .",
    "furthermore , if the particle has nonzero initial velocity , then upon leaving the bubble it will still have nonzero velocity",
    ". the velocity of null particles can not be altered by these effects , however the energy of the null particles transforms in the same way as for massive particles .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity boosts scales with the magnitude of the bubble acceleration / deceleration .",
    "since these effects occur during the time the particle is inside the bubble , they will have a greater effect on particles that spend more time within the bubble .",
    "hence particles with small negative velocities obtain a larger effect than particles with large negative velocities",
    ". however , the magnitude of the velocity boosts due to bubble acceleration / deceleration are comparatively small to the bubble interaction effects discussed for positive velocity particles , especially when compared to blueshifts found for the p@xmath60 region .",
    "the region of space behind a superluminally travelling warp bubble is almost entirely devoid of forward travelling particles , however it contains a sparse distribution of particles with greatly reduced energy .",
    "meanwhile the region of space infront of a ship decelerating from superluminal velocity to subluminal velocity is blasted with a concentrated beam of extremely high energy particles .",
    "these results suggest that any ship using an alcubierre warp drive carrying people would need shielding to protect them from potential dangerously blueshifted particles during the journey , and any people at the destination would be gamma ray and high energy particle blasted into oblivion due to the extreme blueshifts for p@xmath60 region particles . while in one way journeys particles travelling towards the origin are potentially dangerously blueshifted , their supposed distance from the origin would render them too sparse to be of major concern by the time they reached the origin .",
