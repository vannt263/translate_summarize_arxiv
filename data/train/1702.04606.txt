    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has been a major target for x - ray surveys due to our ability to detect sources down to non - outbursting x - ray luminosities @xmath4 and its impressive larger number of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the x - ray properties alone can not fully characterize the nature of each source .",
    "hmxbs consist of an early - type ( ob ) massive star and a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) , which accretes matter from the massive star either through strong stellar winds and/or roche - lobe overflow in supergiant systems or through an equatorial decretion disk in , non - supergiant , obe stars ( be / x - ray binaries ; bexrbs ) . the compact object dominates the x - ray spectrum while the companion dominates the optical spectrum .",
    "thus , to understand the nature of bexrbs we need to study their optical counterparts , which should be consistent with obe stars .",
    "these are massive stars that show balmer lines in emission , of which h@xmath0 is typically the most prominent .",
    "although the smc is close enough to resolve its stellar population , we still lack the identification of the optical counterparts or their optical spectral classification for a large fraction ( @xmath5 of the candidate hmxbs ) of the most recent census ( 121 candidates in total ; @xcite ) . to address this issue",
    "we take advantage of the fact that obe stars display h@xmath0 in emission , making them easily discernible from other stars in h@xmath0 narrow - band images , and we performed a wide h@xmath0 imaging survey of the smc to reveal prime candidates for bexrb optical counterparts .",
    "we used the wide field imager ( wfi@mpg / eso 2.2 m , la silla , on 16/17 november , 2011 ) and the mosaic camera ( @ctio / blanco 4 m , cerro tololo , on 15/16 december , 2011 ) to observe 6 and 7 fields in the smc , respectively .",
    "given their large field - of - views ( @xmath6 ) we covered almost the whole galaxy .",
    "each field was observed in the @xmath1 broad - band ( the continuum ) and h@xmath0 narrow - band filters .",
    "a dithering approach was needed to cover camera chip gaps , and the exposure time was selected to achieve a similar depth ( @xmath7 mag ) in both campaigns to allow for coverage of late b - type stars at the distance of the smc . additionally , a set of spectrophotometric standards was observed to flux calibrate the results .",
    "theli was used to reduce and produce the final mosaics from the wfi data . for the mosaic data we retrieved the reduced data products from the noao online pipeline and then combined them using iraf s ` mscred ` package .",
    "we finally re - sampled ( with swarp ) the mosaic images for each field , using a common center and frame size ( for details see @xcite ) .    because of the high source density we performed psf photometry with iraf s ` daophot ` by properly selecting its parameters for each field .",
    "however , we ran the source detection on the broad - band @xmath1 image only , as the same process in h@xmath0 would result to many spurious sources due to the hii regions of the smc .",
    "this ( @xmath1-selected ) source list was used to perform photometry on h@xmath0 .",
    "we first screened the ( flux - calibrated ) ` daophot ` results to select stellar sources , according to their @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and ` sharpness ` ( @xmath10 ) values . since we were interested in ob stars we kept sources brighter than @xmath11 mag , which corresponds to b8 spectral - type stars at the distance of the smc .",
    "we cross - correlated the two filters ( @xmath1 and h@xmath0 ) to identify the common sources and then with the mcps catalog ( @xcite ) to obtain their @xmath12 photometry . using the locus of ob stars ( @xcite ) we selected the best ob candidate sources , for which we calculated their ( h@xmath13 ) index , its error , and snr ( following @xcite ) .    since the @xmath1 filter includes the h@xmath0 region the corresponding baseline for stars without any h@xmath0",
    "excess would be equal to ( h@xmath13)=0 mag .",
    "however , due to the differences between the two filters and the range of spectral types considered , this is not 0 ( see @xcite ) . to overcome this we define the baseline ( h@xmath13 ) value for non - h@xmath0 excess stars individually for each field based on the mode ( @xmath14 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath15 ) of the ( h@xmath13 ) distribution of all ob stars in each field .",
    "we consider as best h@xmath0 emitting candidates the sources with : @xmath16 , and snr@xmath17 .",
    "emitting stars of obe / obs ( col .",
    "3 ) , and the formation rate bexrbs / obe ( col .",
    "( not including fields 3 and 14/15 due to reduction issues and shallower exposures , respectively . ) ]       our survey reveals 9808 h@xmath0 emitting sources in the smc .",
    "this is 2 to 4 times more sources from other previous surveys ( 1844 sources ; @xcite ) , mostly due to our deeper coverage down to @xmath18=18.5 mag instead of @xmath1916.5 mag .    from our analysis we know the number of ob stars and the corresponding number of emission - line stars ( i.e. obe ) .",
    "this allows us to derive the obe / ob fraction for each field .",
    "we find an average value of @xmath20 across the smc , consistent with previous studies ( e.g. @xmath21 from @xcite ) .",
    "this fraction is only a lower limit of the actual population of the obe stars since their activity is a transient phenomenon and only a fraction of them is active in a certain epoch .",
    "furthermore , if we examine the relation of this fraction with @xmath1 magnitude ( @xmath22 spectral sub - types at the distance of the smc ) , we notice a peak at @xmath215 mag ( corresponding to o9-b2 ) and a fast drop with magnitude ( equal to later spectral types ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with previous observations , but we extend it to later b - type stars ( from @xcite : peak at b2 but limited to @xmath2b3 ) .",
    "moreover , it confirms theoretical models that predict a peak of that ratio at b3 , as a result of the critical rotational velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the numbers of obe stars and bexrbs we derive the bexrbs / obe fraction in the range @xmath3 , which provides us with the formation efficiency of these systems with respect to their parent population .",
    "this is a direct measurement of their formation rate , which can place constraints on stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "currently , we are working on the cross - correlation of this catalog with the most recent list of candidate bexrbs in the smc ( @xcite ) in order to identify more optical counterparts ."
