    "gaussian elimination ( ge ) is the archetypal direct algorithm for solving linear systems of equations  @xcite . for an @xmath0 invertible matrix @xmath1",
    ", ge performs a total of @xmath2 steps to solve @xmath3 , where each step requires a nonzero entry to be selected as a pivot .",
    "after @xmath2 ge steps on @xmath1 , the solution to @xmath3 can be calculated by forward and back substitution  @xcite .",
    "this is the elimination procedure that any reader who has taken an introductory linear algebra course is familiar with .    in the last decade ,",
    "an iterative variant of ge has become popular for low rank approximation as a substitute for the computationally expensive singular value decomposition  @xcite . as an iterative algorithm ,",
    "@xmath4 ge steps on @xmath1 are performed to calculate a rank @xmath5 approximation to @xmath1 . in this setting",
    "it is beneficial if @xmath1 is low rank , rectangular , or possesses rapidly decaying singular values as then ge will typically terminate after a handful of steps .",
    "each step of ge in  iterative mode \" is mathematically equivalent to the familiar direct algorithm , though it is described slightly differently .",
    "let @xmath1 be a nonzero @xmath6 matrix and set @xmath7 .",
    "first , ge selects a nonzero entry of @xmath8 called a _ pivot _",
    ", say the @xmath9 entry , and uses row @xmath10 to eliminate column @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes column @xmath11 and row @xmath10 of @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "row @xmath10 and column @xmath11 of the matrix @xmath15 are zero , and the matrix @xmath16 is of rank @xmath17 because it is the outerproduct of a column and row vector . depending on the choice of the pivot , the matrix @xmath18 can be a near - best rank @xmath17 approximation to @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath15 is the zero matrix , then the ge procedure is terminated ; otherwise , a nonzero entry of @xmath15 is selected , say the @xmath19 entry , and a second ge step is performed , i.e. , @xmath20 now , the matrix @xmath21 is zero in row @xmath10 and @xmath22 as well as column @xmath11 and @xmath23 .",
    "the two rank @xmath17 matrices from   and   can be added together to form a rank @xmath24 approximation to @xmath1 .",
    "the ge procedure is terminated if @xmath21 is the zero matrix ; otherwise , a nonzero entry of @xmath21 is selected followed by another ge step . in principle , ge continues for @xmath5 steps until the matrix @xmath25 is zero or its entries are considered to be sufficiently small in magnitude .    by the wedderburn ",
    "guttman theorem  @xcite , each ge step reduces the rank of @xmath1 by precisely one and hence , ge is guaranteed to terminate after at most @xmath26 steps .",
    "the rank @xmath17 matrices from the first @xmath5 ge steps can be accumulated to form a rank @xmath5 approximation to @xmath1 .",
    "other direct algorithms can also be used in an iterative manner to construct low rank approximations  @xcite .",
    "the strategy for selecting ge pivots is very important as it alters the numerical stability and computational efficiency of the algorithm as well as the near - optimality of the constructed low rank approximations  @xcite .",
    "there are many pivoting strategies such as ( in order of computational cost ) partial pivoting ( pivot is the absolute maximum entry in a column ) , rook pivoting ( pivot is the absolute maximum entry in its column and row ) , and complete pivoting ( pivot is the absolute maximum entry in the matrix ) .",
    "unfortunately , partial pivoting is not suitable for ge in iterative mode  @xcite , though it is the standard choice when solving linear systems of equations . instead , complete or rook pivoting",
    "is often employed  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on complete pivoting .",
    "complete pivoting is prohibitively expensive because at each step the whole matrix must be searched to find the absolute maximum entry . for an @xmath6 matrix ,",
    "this costs @xmath27 operations and a full search must be repeated before each ge step . in many applications",
    "this is too costly as @xmath26 is in the thousands , and the matrix entries may be computed on - demand as opposed to stored  @xcite .",
    "instead , it is common to only find an entry with a sufficiently large absolute value by searching a small proportion of the matrix .",
    "a partial search of the matrix may happen to find the absolute maximum entry of @xmath1 for the pivot , but often it will not .",
    "we regard such a pivoting strategy as complete pivoting with mistakes .",
    "these pivoting mistakes could render the ge procedure numerically unstable and useless when performed in floating point arithmetic . here",
    ", we show that later ge steps seem to correct earlier pivoting mistakes to allow the iterative variant of ge to be used numerically .",
    "it is currently being employed with various algorithmic details in : ( 1 ) hierarchical matrix compression , where it is called adaptive cross approximation  @xcite , ( 2 ) low rank function approximation , where it is sometimes refered to as geddes  newton approximation  @xcite , and ( 3 ) randomized techniques , where it computes a two - sided interpolative decomposition with relaxed constraints  @xcite .",
    "an important quantity for the analysis of the ge procedure is the growth factor  @xcite , denoted by @xmath28 , which is defined as the maximum relative amplification of the matrix entries during the ge procedure .",
    "since we are interested in the iterative analogue , we also define the term _ intermediate growth factor_.    for an @xmath6 matrix @xmath1 , the intermediate growth factor @xmath29 for ge step @xmath5 with @xmath30 is given by the ratio between the absolute maximum entry of @xmath25 and the original matrix @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 for complete pivoting , the growth factor is given by @xmath32 .",
    "given a pivoting strategy , if the growth factor @xmath28 is very large then ge with that pivoting strategy is not a backward stable algorithm , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "the literature regarding the growth factor for different pivoting strategies is summarized in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "there are many interesting practical nuances regarding ge , its numerical stability , and the growth factor .",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite .    for ge with complete pivoting",
    ", wilkinson showed that @xmath33 for any @xmath0 matrix @xmath1  @xcite . since @xmath28 grows slowly with @xmath2 , the direct algorithm is regarded as backwards stable .",
    "however , for the iterative variant pivoting mistakes are allowed and one might expect that this causes the intermediate growth factors to rapidly grow . in theorem",
    "[ thm : gemistakes ] we show that this does not happen .",
    "if @xmath34 is the pivot for step @xmath30 , then we can quantify the quality of this pivot by using the value @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes a matrix norm .",
    "when @xmath37 the @xmath5th pivot is the absolute maximum entry of @xmath38 and no mistake was made .",
    "when @xmath39 a pivoting mistake occurred and the severity of the mistake is inversely proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 is impossible since then the pivoting entry must be nonzero for the ge step to be defined .",
    "let @xmath1 be a nonzero @xmath6 matrix and @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 steps of the iterative variant of ge have been performed on @xmath1 with pivot qualities @xmath42 .",
    "label the intermediate matrices during the ge procedure by @xmath43 , see   and   for @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "we can bound the intermediate growth factors as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a nonzero @xmath6 matrix and suppose that @xmath30 ge steps are performed on @xmath1 with pivot quality @xmath44 .",
    "then , the intermediate growth factor after @xmath5 ge steps on @xmath1 is bounded by @xmath45 [ thm : gemistakes ]    fix @xmath30 and suppose that ge selects pivots at the entries @xmath46 .",
    "take the corresponding @xmath47 submatrix of pivoting entries given by @xmath48 and , for @xmath49 , let @xmath50 be the reduced matrices defined by @xmath51 we now bound the intermediate growth factors of @xmath52 , before relating the bound to the intermediate growth factors of @xmath1 .",
    "the proof is a generalization of an argument used by wilkinson  @xcite .    if @xmath53 denote the absolute values of the pivoting entries , i.e. , @xmath54 , then @xmath55 where we used the fact that the determinant of a matrix is equal to plus or minus the product of the ge pivots .",
    "on the other hand , by hadamard s inequality on the determinant we know that @xmath56 where we used the fact that each entry of @xmath50 is bounded above by @xmath57 and therefore , the 2-norm of a column of @xmath50 is bounded above by @xmath58 .",
    "combining   and   we obtain the inequality @xmath59 let @xmath60 and take the logarithm of   and also of   with @xmath61 , to obtain @xmath62 and @xmath63 we now divide the equation in   by @xmath64 for @xmath65 and divide   by @xmath66 , before adding them together . by observing that @xmath67",
    "we obtain the following inequality @xmath68 defining @xmath69 and canceling terms , we arrive at @xmath70 using   for @xmath71 we conclude that @xmath72 in other words , @xmath73 can be bounded above by @xmath74 finally , using the relation @xmath75 and the fact that @xmath76 we have @xmath77 to obtain a bound on @xmath29 we note that @xmath78 since the @xmath5th pivot has quality @xmath40",
    ". therefore , we have @xmath79 and the result follows by noting that @xmath80  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : gemistakes ] closely follows wilkinson s original analysis of the growth factor for ge with complete pivoting  @xcite .",
    "there are four generalizations : ( 1 ) the analysis allows for pivoting mistakes , ( 2 ) the intermediate growth factors are bounded , ( 3 ) the analysis allows for rectangular matrices , and ( 4 ) the proof does not require that @xmath81 and @xmath2 are finite , though @xmath5 must be , allowing the analysis to also apply to the approximation of functions .",
    "shows that when ge is applied to a function of two variables  @xcite , then it is reasonable to select a pivot as a large function value , as opposed to the absolute maximum of the function .",
    "for example , one can select the pivot as the largest value on a sufficiently dense sampling grid , as employed in  @xcite . ]",
    "if @xmath82 is finite , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for @xmath85 , then the growth factor bound in  @xcite is recovered , up to a factor of @xmath24 .    the bound on @xmath29 in theorem  [ thm : gemistakes ] reveals a correcting phenomenon .",
    "naively , one would expect that it is possible for pivoting mistakes to accumulate in a multiplicative fashion ; however , theorem  [ thm : gemistakes ] reveals that this is not possible .",
    "for example , the bound on @xmath29 depends on the quality of the second ge pivot by the factor @xmath86 , and as @xmath5 increases the influence of @xmath87 on the intermediate growth factor diminishes .",
    "it is as if ge can use later steps to slowly correct earlier pivoting mistakes .",
    "figure  [ fig : geselfcorrects2 ] shows the intermediate growth factors when ge with complete pivoting is applied to a randomly generated @xmath88 matrix , where pivoting mistakes are not allowed .",
    "figure  [ fig : geselfcorrects ] shows the intermediate growth factors when ge with complete pivoting is applied to the same matrix , where pivoting mistakes are allowed every ten ge steps . for the experiments a pivot of quality @xmath89",
    "is selected by sorting all the possible candidate entries and picking a pivot that has the smallest quality that is @xmath90 .",
    "ties are broken arbitrarily .",
    "two examples below further illustrate the bound in theorem  [ thm : gemistakes ] .",
    "gescript_nomistakes ( 20,22 ) ge with complete pivoting , no pivoting mistakes ( 2,14 ) @xmath29 ( 94,13 ) @xmath28 ( 47,-2 ) ge step ( 11,13.3 ) ( 2,0)82    gescript ( 28,22 ) pivoting mistakes every ten ge steps ( 2,14 ) @xmath29 ( 94,19.5 ) @xmath28 ( 47,-2 ) ge step ( 11,19.9 ) ( 2,0)82      suppose that all the pivots have the same quality @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 , for @xmath93 . by theorem  [ thm : gemistakes ] , the intermediate growth rate is bounded above by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath5th harmonic number . since @xmath96 we have , @xmath97 for example",
    ", if @xmath98 then the bound on the intermediate growth rate degrades compared to complete pivoting without mistakes by an asymptotic factor of only @xmath99 as @xmath100 .",
    "this shows that ge is very robust to severe pivoting mistakes .      to further show that pivoting mistakes are corrected by later ge steps , we take @xmath101 for @xmath93 . here , the first few pivots are of poor quality , while the quality of later pivots is much better . by theorem  [ thm : gemistakes ]",
    ", we have @xmath102 therefore , even though the quality of early pivots is logarithmically poor the bound on the intermediate growth rate degrades by only a factor of @xmath103 as @xmath104 .",
    "this example shows that ge is able to correct pivoting mistakes , and could lead to faster algorithms because pivoting strategies can be far less stringent in the first few steps of ge .",
    "while ge with complete pivoting is robust to pivoting mistakes , ge with partial pivoting is not .    consider ge with partial pivoting , where the @xmath5th pivot is selected as the absolute maximum entry in column @xmath5 . here",
