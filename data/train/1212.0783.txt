    "hypernuclear - multibaryonic systems with non - zero strangeness are an important branch of contemporary nuclear physics .",
    "the strange baryon is an impurity in the system that allows one to measure the system response to the stress imposed by it .",
    "the study of its propagation can reveal configurations or states not seen in other ways and gives interesting , important insight into the structure of ordinary nuclear matter . in fact , the hyperon is not affected by the pauli principle and can penetrate deep inside the nucleus .",
    "more generally , the nucleus provides a unique laboratory for studying the lambda interaction .",
    "hypernuclear experimental studies up to now have been carried out by hadron - induced reactions , ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) or ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , with limited energy resolution ( about 1.5 mev at the best ) .",
    "the experimental panorama can be greatly improved using electro - production of strangeness , characterized by large momentum transfer @xmath12 350 mev / c and strong spin - flip terms even at zero kaon production angles .",
    "photons may excite both natural and unnatural parity , low and high - spin hypernuclear states including states with a deeply - bound lambda hyperon .",
    "moreover , in the case of ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) or ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , the elementary production of the lambda hyperon occurs on the neutron , while in the electromagnetic production , the ( @xmath11 , @xmath5 ) pair production occurs on the proton making it possible to study hypernuclei not otherwise available ( e.g. @xmath3 ) including the hypernuclei with a large excess of neutral baryons ( @xmath13 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "comparison of the spectra of mirror hypernuclei ( e.g  ) can then shed some light on the charge asymmetry of hyperon - nucleon forces",
    ". the disadvantage of smaller electromagnetic cross sections is partially compensated by the high current , high duty cycle , and high energy resolution capabilities of the beam at jefferson lab .",
    "missing mass resolution as good as @xmath14 600 kev ( fwhm ) can be attained , in principle , assuming beam energy stability of 2.5x@xmath15 and high resolution spectrometer momentum resolution of @xmath16(fwhm ) .",
    "a large effort has been made by the collaboration to improve the experimental apparatus for this specific experiment .",
    "the experiment e94 - 107 , in hall a at jefferson lab started a systematic study on 1p - shell targets , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite",
    "in order to effectively do high - resolution hypernuclear spectroscopy experiments with electron beams three ingredients are required : ( 1 ) a high quality , high current , high duty factor , 4 gev electron beam . ( 2 ) two high resolution spectrometer arms .",
    "( 3 ) excellent particle identification .",
    "hall a at jlab is well suited to perform @xmath6 experiments .",
    "scattered electrons can be detected in the high resolution spectrometer ( hrs ) electron arm while coincident kaons are detected in the hrs hadron arm @xcite .",
    "the experiment required a continuous 100  @xmath17a electron beam with very small energy spread and vertical spot size ( energy spread @xmath18 2.5x@xmath15 spot size @xmath18 100 @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the energy spread was monitored continuously using a syncrotron light interferometer ( sli ) to monitor the physical size of the beam at a point in the hall a arc with large dispersion .",
    "a 100  mg/@xmath19 target was used for the @xmath0 experiment with an electron beam current of 100  @xmath17a .",
    "the strong inverse dependence of the cross section on @xmath20 , squared virtual photon 4-momentum transfer , calls for measurements at low @xmath20 . to maximize the cross section ,",
    "the electron scattering angle must be minimized , in compromise with the increasing background from processes at very forward electron angles . to minimize the momentum transferred to the hyperon , and maximize the cross section , a detection angle @xmath21 must be chosen near the virtual photon direction .",
    "the high beam energy results in a relatively high momentum for the kaon , as required to keep a reasonable survival fraction in the spectrometer ( 25  m flight path ) .",
    "so , kinematics were set to particle detection at 6@xmath22 for both electrons and kaons , incident beam energy of 3.77 gev , scattered electron momentum of 1.56 gev / c , and kaon momentum of 1.96  gev / c . in order to allow experiments at very forward angles ,",
    "a superconducting septum magnet was added to each hrs .",
    "particles at scattering angles of 6@xmath22 are deflected by the septum magnets into the hrs .",
    "the energy resolution depends on the momentum resolution of the hrs spectrometers , on the straggling and energy loss in the target , and on the beam energy spread .",
    "the high background level demands a very efficient pid system with unambiguous kaon identification .",
    "the standard pid system in the hadron arm is composed of two aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( @xmath23 = 1.015 @xmath24 = 1.055 ) @xcite .",
    "however , due to inefficiencies and delta - ray production , the identification of kaons has contamination from pions and protons .",
    "this has driven the design , construction , and installation of a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , conceptually identical to the alice hmpid design , in the hadron hrs detector package .",
    "it uses a proximity focusing geometry , a csi photocathode , and a 15 mm thick liquid perfluorohexane radiator .",
    "a detailed description of the layout and the performance of the rich detector is given in @xcite .",
    "compared with a new theoretical calculation ( dashed line , see text).,width=359 ]    the measured excitation energy spectrum of @xmath0 from a 100 mg/@xmath19 target is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newcarb ] . the results of the investigation of the @xmath25 have been already described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the theoretical cross sections , for all of the investigated hypernuclei , are obtained in the framework of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) @xcite using the saclay - lyon ( sla ) model @xcite for the elementary @xmath26 reaction .",
    "shell - model wave functions are determined using a parametrization of the @xmath27 interaction that fits the precise @xmath28-ray hypernuclear spectra of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the data for the ground state and the core - excited states is very good .",
    "for the first time a measurable strength with good energy resolution has been observed in the core - excited part of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath30 part of the spectrum is well reproduced by the theory .",
    "the distribution of strength within several mev on either side of the strong @xmath31 peak at 10.95 mev should stimulate theoretical work to better understand the p region .",
    "compared with the theoretical calculation.,width=359 ]    the results of the investigation of the @xmath32 have been recently published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a waterfall target has been used .",
    "kinematics were set to electron detection at 6@xmath22 for scattered electrons with momentum of 1.44 gev / c , incident beam energy of 3.66 gev , virtual photon energy of 2.2 gev with @xmath20 = 0.06 gev@xmath33 .",
    "produced kaons were detected with momenta of 1.96  gev / c at 6@xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : oxy ] shows the cross - section for the @xmath4 hypernuclear spectrum produced on oxygen nuclei at @xmath34= 6@xmath22 . the dotted line is a result of the theoretical calculation obtained with the sla model for the elementary cross section and by using j. millener calculations for the hypernuclear structure .",
    "the continuous black line is the fit of the curve with same procedure used for the carbon spectrum .",
    "the overall picture shows a very good agreement between the data and the calculations in terms of positions and relative strength of the levels .",
    "the waterfall thickness used during the experiment is 75 mg/@xmath19 , which was measured from the cross - section of the elastic reaction on hydrogen .",
    "the measured @xmath5 binding energy = 13.57 @xmath35 0.25 mev obtained for the first peak is an important quantity because there are few emulsion events for the heavier p - shell hypernuclei and these events tend to have ambiguous interpretations and the reactions involving the production of a @xmath5 from a neutron are more difficult to normalize .",
    "the analysis of @xmath7 energy spectrum is not yet finalized : with respect to what was reported in @xcite a fine correction for radiative effects has been performed , fig .",
    "[ radiativecorr ] shows the effect of this correction .",
    "correction of radiative effects on preliminary @xmath7 excitation energy spectrum .",

    ", width=453 ]    the monte carlo code simc @xcite has been used for this purpose : once the simulated data fit well the experimental data , then the radiative effects in simc are turned off and the ratios between simulated data with no radiative effects and simulated data including radiative effects are the bin - by - bin correction factors for the experimental points .",
    "[ fig2label ] shows a preliminary @xmath7 excitation energy spectrum corrected for the radiative effects .",
    "since the dwia calculations predict five states , a five - peak gaussian fit ( thick black curve ) is performed on the data points , with the only constraint of having the same width for the five peaks .",

    "the five - peak gaussian fit is constrained by the model : the separation and the relative amplitude of the individual levels composing the first and the third peak ( doublets ) are fixed according to the theoretical expectations . in other words",
    ", this fit corresponds to a three - peak fit where the internal structure of the complex peaks is determined by the theory . as in fig .",
    "[ fig2label ] , the width of the five peaks is constrained to be a single value , resulting here in 760  kev ( fwhm ) .",
    "+ according to this preliminary analysis , the position of the peaks and the amplitude of the first doublet are in good agreement with the model , the amplitude of the excited states are instead underestimated by the theoretical predictions .",
    "the reason for the disagreemnt in strength for the second and third peak , is hard to ascertain and could be due to a number of deficiences in the structure or reaction calculations     +",
