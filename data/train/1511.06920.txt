    "the basal ganglia are critical brain structures for behavioral control , whose organization has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution  @xcite . altered activity of the basal ganglia underlies a wide range of human neurological and psychiatric disorders , but the specific computations normally performed by these circuits remain elusive .",
    "the largest component of the basal ganglia is the striatum , which appears to have a key role in adaptive decision - making based on reinforcement history  @xcite , and in behavioral timing on scales from tenths of seconds to tens of seconds  @xcite .",
    "the great majority ( @xmath0 ) of striatal neurons are gabaergic medium spiny neurons ( msns ) , which project to other basal ganglia structures but also make local collateral connections within striatum  @xcite .",
    "these local connections were proposed in early theories to achieve action selection through strong winner - take - all lateral inhibition  @xcite , but this idea fell out of favor once it became clear that msn connections are actually sparse ( nearby connection probabilities @xmath1  @xcite ) , unidirectional and relatively weak  @xcite . nonetheless , striatal networks are intrinsically capable of generating sequential patterns of cell activation , even in brain slice preparations without time - varying external inputs  @xcite . following previous experimental evidence that collateral inhibition can help organize msn firing  @xcite ,",
    "an important recent set of modeling studies argued that the sparse connections between msns , though individually weak , can collectively mediate sequential switching between cell assemblies  @xcite .",
    "it was further hypothesized that these connections may even be optimally configured for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "this proposal is of high potential significance , since sequential dynamics may be central to the striatum s functional role in the organization and timing of behavioral output  @xcite .    in their work",
    "@xcite , ponzi and wickens used conductance - based model neurons ( with persistent @xmath2 and @xmath3 currents  @xcite ) , in proximity to a bifurcation from a stable fixed point to a tonic firing regime .",
    "we show here that networks based on simpler leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neurons can also exhibit sequences of cell assembly activation .",
    "this simpler model , together with a novel measure of structured bursting , allows us to more clearly identify the critical parameters needed to observe dynamics resembling that of the striatal msn network . among other results ,",
    "we show that the duration of gabaergic post - synaptic currents is crucial for the network@xmath4s ability to discriminate different input patterns .",
    "a reduction of the post - synaptic time scale , analogous to that observed for ipscs of msns in mouse models of huntington s disease ( hd )  @xcite , leads in our model to alteration of single neuron and population dynamics typical of striatal dynamics in symptomatic hd mice  @xcite .",
    "finally , we qualitatively replicate the observed response of striatal networks in brain slices to altered excitatory drive and to reduction of gabaergic transmission between axon collaterals of striatal neurons  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect can be induced by dopamine loss  @xcite , therefore our results may help generate new insights into the aberrant activity patterns observed in parkinson s disease ( pd ) .",
    "the model is composed of @xmath5 leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) inhibitory neurons  @xcite , with each neuron receiving inputs from a randomly selected 5@xmath6 of the other neurons ( i.e. a directed erds - renyi graph with constant in - degree @xmath7 , where @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "the inhibitory post - synaptic potentials ( psps ) are schematized as @xmath9-functions characterized by a decay time @xmath10 and a peak amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , each neuron @xmath12 is subject to an excitatory input current mimicking the cortical and thalamic inputs received by the striatal network . in order to obtain firing periods of any duration",
    "the excitatory drives are tuned to drive the neurons in proximity of the supercritical bifurcation between the quiescent and the firing state , similarly to  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our model is integrated exactly between a spike emission and the successive one by rewriting the time evolution of the network as an event - driven map  @xcite ( for more details see methods ) .    since we will compare most of our findings with the results reported in a previous series of papers by ponzi and wickens ( pw )  @xcite it is important to stress the similarities and differences between the two models .",
    "the model employed by pw is a two dimensional conductance - based model with a potassium and a sodium channel  @xcite , our model is simply a current based lif model .",
    "the parameters of the pw model are chosen so that the cell is in proximity of a saddle - node on invariant circle ( snic ) bifurcation to guarantee a smooth increase of the firing period when passing from the quiescent to the supra - threshold regime , without a sudden jump in the firing rate .",
    "similarly , in our simulations the parameters of the lif model are chosen in proximity of the bifurcation from silent regime to tonic firing . in the pw model",
    "the psps are assumed to be exponentially decaying , in our case we considered @xmath9-functions .    in particular , we are interested in selecting model parameters for which uniformly distributed inputs @xmath13 , where @xmath14 $ ] , produce cell assembly - like sequential patterns in the network",
    ". the main aspects of the desired activity can be summarized as follows : ( i ) single neurons should exhibit large variability in firing rates ( @xmath15 ) ; ( ii ) the dynamical evolution of neuronal assemblies should reveal strong correlation within an assembly and anti - correlation with neurons out of the assembly . as suggested by many authors  @xcite the dynamics of msns can not be explained in terms of a _ winners take all _ ( wta ) mechanism , which would imply a small number of highly firing neurons , while the remaining would be silenced .",
    "therefore we will search , in addition to the requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) , for a regime where a substantial fraction of neurons are actively involved in the network dynamics .",
    "this represents a third criterion ( iii ) to be fulfilled to obtain a striatum - like dynamical evolution .",
    "[ fig : ponzibenchmark ] shows an example of such dynamics for the lif model , with three pertinent similarities to previously observed dynamics of real msn networks  @xcite .",
    "firstly , cells are organized into correlated groups , and these groups are mutually anticorrelated ( as evident from the cross - correlation matrix of the firing rates reported in fig .  [ fig : ponzibenchmark ] ( c ) ) .",
    "secondly , individual cells within groups show irregular firing as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ponzibenchmark ] ( a ) .",
    "this aspect is reflected in a coefficient of variation ( @xmath16 ) of the inter - spike - intervals ( isis ) definitely greater than one ( see the black curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : cv1_cv2 ] ( b ) ) as observed experimentally for the dynamics of rat striatum _ in - vitro",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the raster plot reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : ponzibenchmark ] ( b ) reveals that a large fraction of neurons ( namely,@xmath17 % ) is actively involved in the neural dynamics .       the properties ( i),(ii ) , and ( iii ) , characterizing msn activity , can be quantified in terms of a single scalar metric @xmath18 , as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes average over the ensemble of @xmath5 neurons , @xmath21 is the fraction of active neurons @xmath22 out of the total number , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 zero - lag cross - correlation matrix between all the pairs of single neuron firing rates @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the standard deviation of this matrix ( for details see methods ) . we expect that good parameter values for our model can be selected by maximizing @xmath18 .",
    "our metric is inspired by a metric introduced to identify the level of cluster synchronization and organization for a detailed striatal microcircuit model  @xcite .",
    "however , that metric is based on the similarity among the point - process spike trains emitted by the various neurons , whereas @xmath18 uses correlations between firing rate time - courses .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 takes also in account the variability of the firing rates , by including the average @xmath16 in eq .",
    ", an aspect of the msn dynamics omitted by the metric employed in @xcite . within biologically meaningful ranges",
    ", we find values of the parameters controlling lateral inhibition ( namely , the synaptic strength @xmath27 and the the post - synaptic potential duration @xmath28 ) that maximize @xmath18 . as we show below , the chosen parameters not only produce msn - like network dynamics but also optimize the network@xmath4s computational capabilities , in the sense of producing a consistent , temporally - structured response , to a given pattern of inputs while discriminating between inputs which differ only for a few elements .      in this sub - section we examine how network dynamics is affected by the strength of inhibitory connections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv ] ) .",
    "when these lateral connections are very weak ( parameter @xmath27 close to zero ) , the dominant input to each neuron is the constant excitation . as a result , most individual neurons are active ( fraction of active neurons , @xmath29 , is close to 1 ) and firing regularly ( @xmath16 close to zero ) . as lateral inhibition",
    "is made stronger , some neurons begin to slow down or even stop firing , and @xmath29 declines towards a minimum fraction of @xmath30 ( at @xmath31 ) . as noted by ponzi and wickens  @xcite ,",
    "this is due to a winner - take - all ( wta ) mechanism : faster - firing neurons depress or even silence the neurons to which they are connected .",
    "this is evident from the distribution @xmath32 of the average interspike intervals ( @xmath33 ) , which is peaked at low firing periods , and from the distribution of the @xmath16 exhibiting a single large peak at @xmath34 ( as shown in the insets of figs .",
    "s2 ( a , b ) and ( d , e ) ) .",
    "as soon as @xmath35 , the neuronal activity is no longer due only to the _ winners _ , but also the _ losers _ begin to play a role .",
    "the _ winners _ are characterized by an effective input @xmath36 which is on average supra - threshold , while their firing activity is driven by the mean current : _",
    "winners _ are _ mean - driven _  @xcite . on the other hand , _ losers _",
    "are on average below - threshold , and their firing is due to current fluctuations : _ losers _ are _ fluctuation - driven _  @xcite . for more details",
    "see figs .",
    "s2 ( c ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "this is reflected in the corresponding distribution @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv](b ) , red curve ) .",
    "the _ winners _ have very short @xmath33s ( i.e. high firing rates ) , while the _ losers _ are responsible for the long tail of the distribution extending up to @xmath37 s. in the distribution of the coefficients of variation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv](b ) inset , red curve ) the _ winners _ generate a peak of very low @xmath16 ( i.e. highly - regular firing ) , suggesting that they are not strongly influenced by the other neurons in the network and therefore have an effective input on average supra - threshold .",
    "by contrast the _ losers _ are associated with a smaller peak at @xmath38 , confirming that their firing is due to large fluctuations in the currents .",
    "counterintuitively however , further increases in lateral inhibition strength result in increased neuronal participation , with @xmath29 progressively returning towards @xmath39 . the same effect was previously reported by ponzi and wickens  @xcite for a different , more complex , model .",
    "when the number of active neurons returns almost to 100% , i.e. for sufficiently large coupling @xmath35 , most of the neurons appear to be below threshold , as revealed by the distribution of the effective inputs @xmath36 reported in figs .",
    "s2 ( c ) and ( f ) . therefore in this case",
    "the network firing is essentially fluctuation - driven , as a matter of fact the @xmath32 distribution is now characterized by a broader distribution and by the absence of the peak at short @xmath33 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv ] ( b ) , blue line ; see also figs .",
    "s2(a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "furthermore the single neuron dynamics is definitely bursting , as shown by the fact that the @xmath16 distribution is now centered around @xmath40 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv ] ( b ) , blue line ; see also figs .",
    "s2(b ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "the transition between the two dynamical regimes , occurring at @xmath31 , is due to a passage from a state where some _ winner _ neuron were mean - driven and were able to depress all the other neurons , to a state at @xmath41 where almost all neurons are fluctuation - driven and contribute to the network activity .",
    "the transition occurs because at @xmath42 the fluctuations in the effective input currents @xmath36 are small and insufficient to drive the _ losers _ towards the firing threshold ( as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "s2 ( c ) and ( f ) ) . at @xmath43",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations becomes sufficient for some _ losers _ to cross the firing threshold and contribute to the number of active neurons .",
    "this will also reduce the _",
    "winners@xmath4 _ activity .",
    "for @xmath41 the fluctuations of @xmath36 are sufficient to lead almost all _ losers _ to fire and no clear distinction between _ losers _ and _ winners _ remains .",
    "the transition is due to the fact that not only the average inhibitory action is proportional to the synaptic strength , but also the amplitude of the current fluctuations increases linearly with @xmath27 , at least for @xmath35 ( as shown in figs .",
    "s3(a ) and ( b ) and explained in text s1 ) .",
    "the reported results explain why the variability @xmath44 of the cross - correlation matrix has a non monotonic behaviour with @xmath27 ( as shown in the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv](a ) ) . at low coupling @xmath44 is almost zero , since the single neuron dynamics are essentially independent one from another , while the increase of the coupling leads to an abrupt rise of @xmath44 .",
    "this growth is clearly associated with the inhibitory action which splits the neurons into correlated and anti - correlated groups .",
    "the variability of the cross - correlation matrix achieves a maximum value for coupling slightly larger than @xmath45 , where fluctuations in the effective currents begin to play a relevant role in the network dynamics . at larger",
    "coupling @xmath44 begins to decay towards a finite non zero value .",
    "these results confirm that the most interesting region to examine is the one with coupling @xmath46 , as already suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the observed behaviour of @xmath16 , @xmath29 and @xmath44 suggests that we should expect a maximum in @xmath18 at some intermediate coupling @xmath35 , as indeed we have found for both studied cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q0andcv ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the initial increase in @xmath18 is due to the increase in @xmath16 and @xmath29 , while the final decrease , following the occurrence of the maximum , is essentially driven by the decrease of @xmath44 . for larger @xmath47",
    "the neurons tend to fire regularly in a wider range of coupling at small @xmath27 ( see fig .",

    "we expect that even the single neurons should have completely different dynamics in these two regimes , since the distributions @xmath63 at @xmath72 ms and 20 ms are essentially not overlapping , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv1_cv2](b ) . in order to focus the analysis on the effects due to the synaptic inhibition , we have chosen , in both cases , neurons receiving exactly the same external excitatory drive @xmath73 .",

    "thus these neurons can be considered as displaying a typical activity in both regimes . as expected , the dynamics of the two neurons is quite different , as evident from the @xmath76 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : isi_distribut](a ) and ( b ) . in both cases",

    "interestingly , the main macroscopic differences between the two distributions arises at short time intervals . for @xmath80 ms , ( see fig . [",
    "fig : isi_distribut](b ) ) an isolated and extremely narrow peak appears at isi@xmath81 .",
    "this first peak corresponds to the supra - threshold tonic - firing of the isolated neuron , as reported above .",
    "after this first peak , a gap is clearly visible in the @xmath76 followed by an exponential tail .",
    "the origin of the gap resides in the fact that isi@xmath82 , because if the neuron is firing tonically with its period isi@xmath81 and receives a single psp , the membrane potential has time to decay almost to the reset value @xmath83 before the next spike emission .",
    "thus a single psp will delay the next firing event by a fixed amount corresponding to the gap in fig .  [",
    "fig : isi_distribut](b ) .",

    "[ fig : isi_distribut](b ) .",
    "no further gaps are discernible in the distribution , because it is highly improbable that the neuron will receive two ( or more ) psps exactly at the same moment at reset , as required to observe further gaps .",
