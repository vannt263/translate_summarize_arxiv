    "( [ pothsc6 ] ) , therefore , consists of a hard - sphere potential for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) and a long - range dispersion @xmath82 potential for @xmath83 . in the present study , the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath84 in eqs .",
    "( [ potsech])-([potc6b ] ) are adjusted to give the desired @xmath1 and number of bound states . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the values of @xmath74 and @xmath84 at which there exist zero - energy bound states ( @xmath58 ) as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 corresponds to the number of @xmath0-wave bound states . for the potential model in eq .",
    "( [ pothsc6 ] ) , however , we adjusted @xmath88 to produce the changes in @xmath1 , but we only performed three - body calculations near the first pole at @xmath89 .",

    "( [ potc6a])-([pothsc6 ] ) have in common the same large @xmath13 behavior given by the van der waals interaction , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the van der waals dispersion coefficient . for these potentials ,",
    "the important length scale is the van der waals length defined as @xmath92 @xcite , where @xmath71 is two - body reduced mass .",
    "therefore , in order to compare the results from these models to those for @xmath34 , we define an equivalent @xmath6 for @xmath34 through the relationship between @xmath6 and the effective range @xmath93 for @xmath34 , namely , @xmath94 @xcite , valid for values @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath34 we have found that @xmath96 depends on the potential depth @xmath97 , while for van der waals type of interactions , such as those in eqs .",
    "( [ potc6a])-([pothsc6 ] ) , @xmath93 is fixed by @xmath98 .",
    "nevertheless , after rescaling the three - body results obtained from @xmath34 in terms of @xmath6 , we found good agreement with those obtained using @xmath26 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , thus indicating that the effective range is in fact the most relevant length scale in the problem .",
    "we chose , however , to keep our results in terms of @xmath6 to make a closer analogy to the experiments using alkali atoms .",
    "our claim here is that the origin of the universality of the three - body parameter is related to the suppression of the probability to find two particles at distances @xmath28 .",
    "this suppression leads to the formation of the universal three - body potential barrier near @xmath52 , thus strongly suppressing the three - body wave function at shorter distances where the details of the two- and three - body interactions are important [ see fig .  1  ( b ) of our main text ]",
    ". next we explore the origin of this suppression at the two - body level .    to gain some insight into the likelihood of finding particles inside the potential well , we start by defining the following quantities , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the two - body scattering wave function at energy @xmath101 , defined such that @xmath102 with @xmath103 the @xmath0-wave scattering phase shift . this definition for @xmath100",

    "( [ potc6a])-([pothsc6 ] ) it is defined to be @xmath106 .    the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be associated with the `` average '' amplitude of the wave function inside and outside the potential well , respectively .",
    "we , therefore , define the amplitude inside the well _ relative to the amplitude outside the well _ as : @xmath109 the relative amplitude above vanishes in the limit @xmath104 ( @xmath110 , as a result of our choice for the asymptotic solution in eq .",

    "@xmath107 is _ not _ a probability , but it does measure the likelihood of finding two particles within @xmath115 , where the short - range interactions are experienced .",
    "figure [ fig1a ] shows a typical result for @xmath116 and @xmath114 for the two - body potential in eq .",
    "( [ potsech ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1a ] shows that in the universal regime near the poles in @xmath1 , the wavefunction is suppressed ( small @xmath107 ) and that this suppression becomes more efficient as the potential becomes deeper and more states are bound .",
    "the black filled circles , open circles and open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , showing the values of @xmath107 at @xmath58 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , respectively , illustrate this trend .",
    "note , however , that for values @xmath119 , the parameter @xmath107 quickly increases , indicating a higher likelihood to find particles inside the potential well .",
    "similar results are also obtained for the potentials @xmath26 and @xmath32 [ eqs .",
    "( [ potc6a ] ) and ( [ potc6b ] ) , respectively ] .    , while the green dashed lines represents the parameter @xmath114 .",
    "both quantities are given as a function of the depth @xmath74 of the two - body interaction model @xmath34 [ eq .  ( [ potsech ] ) ] , whose values for which @xmath45 are indicated in the figure as @xmath97 , where @xmath87 is the number of @xmath0-wave states .",
    "black circles , open circles and open squares are the values of @xmath107 at @xmath58 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , showing the suppression of the @xmath107 as the number of bound states increases .",
    "the results for @xmath107 also show higher efficiency of the inside - the - well suppression for @xmath120 .",
    "the black dash - dotted line shows the semi - classical suppression factor @xmath121 demonstrating the origin of the suppression mechanism . ]    the suppression in @xmath107 ( for a fixed value of @xmath95 ) can be understood to be a result of the usual semiclassical suppression of the wave function . in the wkb approach @xcite , the wave function inside the potential well can be written as , @xmath122,\\label{psiwkb}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is",
    "a normalization constant and @xmath124 $ ] defines the _ local _ wave number @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , for deep potentials , the suppression of the wave function inside the potential well is simply related to factor @xmath126 which leads to the suppression of the amplitude of the wkb wave function [ eq .  ( [ psiwkb ] ) ] between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "physically , this can be seen as the increase of the _ local _ velocity @xmath127 ( @xmath17 being the particle mass ) and , therefore , the decrease of the time spent in that interval @xmath18 , @xmath128^{-1}$ ] .",
    "therefore , in the wkb approximation , one would expect @xmath107 to be simply proportional to @xmath129 .",

    "[ fig1a ] the value of @xmath130 ( black dash - dotted line ) which shows that the suppression in @xmath114 is consistent with the semiclassical suppression described above .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that two - body quantum reflection @xcite could be responsible for the suppression of inside - the - well probability , and consequently the universality of the three - body parameter .",
    "quantum reflection is a fundamental phenomenon involving reflection of a low energy quantum matter wave from a potential _ cliff_. in the context of ultracold collisions of ground state neutral atoms , quantum reflection can occur when two atoms approach within a distance comparable to the range of the interaction , @xmath2 , and it is caused by the rapid change of the potential in this region @xcite . in that case , just a fraction of the incoming wave probes the details of the atom - atom interaction at @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis leads us to believe that this is of secondary importance .",
    "the main reason is that in a three - body system , even at zero ( three - body ) energy , two particles can have energies that are not low enough to ensure that quantum reflection plays a rule .",
    "in fact , accordingly to our estimates , in a three - body system the average two - body energy will be proportional to @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that near the universal barrier ( @xmath52 ) the two - body energy can be of the order of @xmath132 .",
    "based on a model similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite the reflection probability at such energies is about 10% , which is too low to explain our observations .",
    "our above analysis , however , shows that for such energies @xmath113 does not differs substantially from @xmath133 , offering a more consistent picture than quantum reflection .",
    "evidently , to precisely quantify the importance of quantum reflection requires a much more detailed analysis of how the energy of two particles in a three - body system behaves as a function of @xmath22 , which is beyond the scope of our present study .",
    "as mentioned in our main text , our analysis of the universality of the three - body parameter was based on the hyperspherical adiabatic representation .",
    "the following , is a sketch of its basic aspects and fundamental equations .",
    "a more detailed description can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "we start here from the hyperradial schrdinger equation : @xmath35f_{\\nu}(r )    \\\\+\\sum_{\\nu'\\neq\\nu } w_{\\nu\\nu'}(r ) f_{\\nu'}(r)=e    f_\\nu(r).\\label{sradeq}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the hyperradius @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of interparticle distances for a system of three equal masses @xmath17 , @xmath134 , and describes the overall size of the system ; @xmath36 is a collective index that represents all quantum numbers necessary to label each channel ; @xmath37 is the three - body reduced mass ; @xmath38 is the total energy ; and @xmath39 is the hyperradial wave function . the simple picture resulting from this representation originates from the fact that nonadiabatic couplings @xmath40 are the quantities that drive inelastic transitions , and that the effective hyperradial potentials @xmath41 , like any usual potential , support bound and resonant states , but now for the three particle system .    to obtain @xmath41 and @xmath40",
    ", however , one needs to diagonalize the adiabatic hamiltonian @xmath135 which includes the hyperangular kinetic energy and _ all _ of the interactions  @xcite .",

    "therefore , the channel functions @xmath53 contain all the information necessary to determine , for fixed values of @xmath22 , the geometric structure of the three particle system . for our present study concerning three identical bosons in the total angular momentum state @xmath138 ( @xmath139 being the parity )",
    ", the set of hyperangles @xmath140 @xcite is reduced to simply @xmath141 .",
    "this helps to visualize the geometric structure of the three - body system [ see figs .  1  ( c)-(e ) and fig .  2 of our main text ] .",
    "finally , to determine the effective potentials @xmath41 and nonadiabatic couplings @xmath40 , which are the main quantities in eq .",

    "for that reason , this section presents some details of our work that not only give support to our physical interpretation of the nature of the three - body parameter but also show how some important nonuniversal aspects appear in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation .",

    "although such cases are relatively infrequent in our calculations ( and occur mostly for the @xmath34 model ) , they do illustrate nonuniversal effects that can affect the three - body parameter .",

    "their large values are thus consistent with our physical picture in which the _ local _ kinetic energy increases and generates the repulsive barrier in our effective potentials .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that since the three - body repulsive barrier prevents particles from approaching to small distances , the question of whether or not the short range physics actually changes as a function of the external magnetic field ( as in experiments in ultracold quantum gases ) @xcite can not be directly answered by observing features related to efimov physics .",

    "<S> previous work has shown that the three - body parameter can be universal  that is , independent of the details of the interactions  in three - polar - molecule systems  @xcite and in three - atom systems near narrow fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite , although recent work has shown that the latter case likely requires even more finely - tuned conditions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our present numerical analysis , however , adds another , broader class of systems with a universal three - body parameter : systems with two - body interactions that efficiently suppress the probability to find any pair of particles separated by less than @xmath2 ( see section  a in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this class of systems , therefore , is more closely related to systems near broad fano - feshbach resonances @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such a suppression could derive from the usual classical suppression of the probability for two particles to exist between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in regions of high _ local _ velocity @xmath15 , which is proportional to @xmath16^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath17 being the particle mass ) , the time spent in that interval @xmath18 ( see section b in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that there could be an additional suppression as well , through quantum reflection from a potential _ cliff _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> systems supporting many bound states , such as the neutral atoms used in ultracold experiments with their strong van der waals attraction , clearly exhibit this suppression . in general , a finite - range two - body potential that supports many bound states decreases steeply with decreasing interparticle distance @xmath13 , starting when @xmath19 , at which point the potential cliff plays a role analogous to a repulsive potential for low - energy scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this fact by showing that the three - body parameter in the presence of many two - body bound states roughly coincides with that for a 100% reflective two - body model potential , where the two - body short - range potential well is replaced by a hard - sphere .     which determines the three particle configuration [ see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the differences between these potentials are shown to lead to differences of a few percent in the three - body parameter . </S>",

    "<S> this representation offers a simple and conceptually clear description by reducing the problem to the solution of the `` hyperradial '' schrdinger equation : @xmath35f_{\\nu}(r )    \\\\+\\sum_{\\nu'\\neq\\nu } w_{\\nu\\nu'}(r ) f_{\\nu'}(r)=e    f_\\nu(r).\\label{radeq}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , the hyperradius @xmath22 describes the overall size of the system ; @xmath36 is the channel index ; @xmath37 is the three - body reduced mass for particle masses @xmath17 ; @xmath38 is the total energy ; and @xmath39 is the hyperradial wave function . the nonadiabatic couplings @xmath40 drive inelastic transitions , and the effective hyperradial potentials @xmath41 support bound and resonant states . to treat problems with deep two - body interactions </S>",

    "<S> ( [ radeq ] ) beyond the adiabatic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> here , we explore the universality of the three - body parameter by analyzing a number of model potentials [ see @xmath34 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath33 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( s.1)-(s.4 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] with different numbers of bound states . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ]  ( a ) shows the adiabatic potentials @xmath44 at @xmath45 obtained using only the two - body lennard - jones potential , @xmath42 , supporting 25 dimer bound states . at first glance , it is difficult to identify any universal properties of these potentials . </S>",
    "<S> efimov physics , however , occurs at a very small energy scale near the three - body breakup threshold . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a closer analysis of the energy range @xmath46 [ fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) ] reveals the universal properties of the key potential curve controlling efimov states and universal scattering properties .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](b ) shows one of our most important pieces of theoretical evidence for universality of the three - body parameter : the effective adiabatic potentials @xmath41 obtained using @xmath26 for more and more two - body bound states converge to a single universal curve . </S>",
    "<S> [ in some cases in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]  ( b ) we have manually diabatized @xmath41 near sharp avoided crossings in order to improve the visualization ( see section d in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> ] as one would expect , the usual efimov behavior for the effective potentials , @xmath47=@xmath48 with @xmath49 , is recovered for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable , however , that @xmath41 also converge to a universal potential for @xmath51 and , more importantly , these effective potentials display a repulsive wall or barrier at @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this barrier prevents the close collisions that would probe the short - range three - body physics , including three - body forces known to be important in chemistry , thus making the three - body parameter universal as we will confirm below . </S>",
    "<S> this is in fact our most striking result : _ a sharp cliff or attraction in the two - body interactions produces a strongly repulsive universal barrier in the effective three - body interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> _    _ qualitatively _ , this universality derives from the reduced probability to find particles inside the attractive two - body potential well . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be seen in terms of the channel functions @xmath53 ( see section c in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]  ( c)-(e ) and the hyperangular probability densities in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation , </S>",
    "<S> the space forbidden to the particles fills an increasingly larger portion of the hyperangular volume as @xmath22 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this evolution can be visualized as the dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a)(d ) expanding outward . in the process </S>",
    "<S> , the channel function @xmath54 is squeezed into an increasingly smaller volume , driving its kinetic energy higher and producing the repulsive barrier in the universal efimov potential . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , this suppression implies that the details of the interaction should be largely unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , different two - body model potentials should give similar three - body potentials . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrates this universality by comparing @xmath41 obtained from different potential models supporting many bound states . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps more importantly , it compares them with the results obtained from the two - body model @xmath33 that replaces the deep well by a hard wall , essentially eliminating the probability of observing any pair of atoms at short distances . </S>",
    "<S> _ quantitatively _ , however , the fact that the barrier occurs only at @xmath52 indicates that universality might not be as robust as in the cases discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus important to quantify the value of the three - body parameter to assess the size of nonuniversal effects .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the three - body parameter could be defined in terms of _ any _ observable related to the efimov physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two of its possible definitions are  @xcite : the value of @xmath55 at which the first efimov resonance appears in three - body recombination ( see for instance ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the energy of the lowest efimov state at @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , demonstrating their universality in the limit of many bound states . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 in this limit differ by no more than 15% from the @xmath33 results  @xmath61 and @xmath62 [ solid black line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) ]  indicating , once again , that the universality of the three - body parameter is dependent upon the suppression of the probability density within the two - body potential wells . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our results for single channel two - body models should be applied for broad feshbach resonances . given this picture </S>",
    "<S> , we attribute the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath63 and @xmath60 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] to the small , but finite , probability to reach short distances , thus introducing nonuniversal effects related to the details of two- and three - body forces including interactions with an isolated perturbing channel </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , our results for @xmath64 are consistent with the experimentally measured value for @xmath12cs @xcite , @xmath7k @xcite , @xmath8li @xcite , @xmath9li @xcite , and @xmath10rb @xcite , all of which lie within about 15% of the @xmath33 result . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , if one simply averages the experimental values , then the result differs from the @xmath33 result by less than 3% .    </S>",
    "<S> previous treatments have failed to predict the universality of the three - body parameter for various reasons . in treatments using zero - range interactions , for instance </S>",
    "<S> , the three - body parameter enters as a free parameter to cure the thomas collapse  @xcite , preventing any statement about its universality . </S>",
    "<S> finite range models , like those used in some of our own treatments @xcite [ corresponding to the results for @xmath34 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ] , have failed for lack of substantial suppression of the probability density in the two - body wells . this scenario , however , should reflect better the situation for light nuclei having few bound states and shallow attraction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , other models @xcite have found better agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of these treatments , however , indicates that the two - body models used have many of the characteristics of our @xmath33 , therefore satisfying the prerequisite for a universal three - body parameter . </S>",
    "<S> a recent attempt  @xcite to explain the universality of the three - body parameter avoided explicit two - body models altogether , using instead an _ ad hoc _ hyperradial potential that bore little resemblance to our numerical potentials in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . this _ </S>",
    "<S> ad hoc _ three - body potential displayed strong attraction at short distances in contrast to our key finding , that a cliff of attraction for two bodies produces a universal _ repulsive _ barrier in the three - body system . consequently </S>",
    "<S> , even though a universal three - body parameter was found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the fundamental understanding provided by the approach is uncertain ( see our discussion in section d of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    in summary , our theoretical examination shows that the three - body parameter controlling many of the universal properties of efimov physics can be a universal parameter under certain circumstances that should be realized in most ultracold neutral atom experiments . provided </S>",
    "<S> the underlying two - body short - range interaction supports a large number of bound states , or it has some other property leading to the suppression of the wave function at short distances , three - body properties associated with efimov physics can be expected to be universal . </S>",
    "<S> while these arguments suggest universality also for the three - body parameter in heteronuclear systems that exhibit efimov physics with only resonant interspecies two - body interactions , verifying this prediction is a high priority for future theory and experiment . equally important </S>",
