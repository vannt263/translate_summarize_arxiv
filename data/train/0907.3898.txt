    "in addition to single - particle observables , more insight may be gained through correlation studies , i.e. , measuring high-@xmath0 hadron production associated with a high-@xmath1trigger .",
    "one motivation is that correlation measurements put tighter constraints on the initial momentum distribution of the partons that fragment into the observed hadrons . in this context",
    ", high @xmath0 photons have been considered as promising trigger particles @xcite as they are mostly produced from early hard binary scatterings .",
    "triggering on such photons should fix the transverse momentum of the away - side parton @xcite .",
