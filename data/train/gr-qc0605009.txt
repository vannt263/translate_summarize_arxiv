    "effects of qed interactions such as vacuum polarization on the photon propagation in a classical background gravitational field gives rise to a wide range of new phenomena .",
    "simple analysis of null rays in classical general relativity implies that a curved spacetime , compared to the flat case , could be treated as an optical medium with a refractive index @xcite .",
    "now adding to that qed effects , in the context of semi - classical gravity , leads to interesting phenomena such as dispersive effects and polarization dependent propagation of photons .",
    "one of the main consequences is found to be the light cone modification in such a way that the qed photons do not propagate along the null geodesics of the background geometry .",
    "they propagate instead along null geodesics of an effective geometry . in many cases depending on the direction and polarization of photons ,",
    "superluminal propagation becomes possible .",
    "quantum characteristics of photon propagation in a curved background opens up a whole new field coined quantum gravitational optics ( qgo)@xcite , started with the pioneering paper by drummond and hathrell who considered the effect of vacuum polarization on photon propagation in a curved background and continued with detailed study of the same effect for specific spacetimes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "coupling of the electromagnetic field with curvature in the qed action introduced in @xcite violates the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) in a mass scale comparable to the electron mass @xmath0 .",
    "the modification of the underlying spacetime geometry felt by photons due to qed interactions has some unexpected results .",
    "the newman - penrose ( np ) formalism has been found to be an elegant way of analyzing the results in the sep violating cases .",
    "quantum gravitational optics attributes velocity shift and null cone modification at each point to only a single np scalar for each of the ricci and weyl tensors , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively @xcite .",
    "the question is what would be the role of other np scalars in determining the forms of ricci and weyl tensors ? or what , if any , would be the effect of the gravitational field on the other photons traveling with the normal speed of light here we shall study the geometric properties of _ physical _ null congruences which are families of physical null rays determined by the effective metric @xmath3 . these are then distinct from the propertries of the _ geometric _ null congruences characterized by the spacetime metric @xmath4 .",
    "these congruences are special in the sense that the modification of the light cone in a local inertial frame ( lif ) can be described as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the minkowski metric , @xmath7 is the fine structure constant and @xmath8 depends on the riemann curvature at the origin of the lif . in one - loop approximation , these photons travel with unit velocity . for on - shell photons , some of the np scalars play the role of optical scalars and their propagation , along the rays , is governed by the known raychaudhuri equation .",
    "we show that these scalars must be effectively modified to describe the _ physical _ null congruences and find that a new set of np scalars contribute in the definition of these _ effective optical scalars_. the modified raychaudhuri equation governing their propagation will be discussed .",
    "the effective geometry may have features that are seen only by photons when propagating in the geometry .",
    "there may be hidden singularities in the form of geodesic incompleteness which can be studied through the implementation of the effective raychaudhuri equation .",
    "the effect of one - loop vacuum polarization on the photon propagation in a fixed curved background spacetime is represented by the following effective action derived by drummond and hathrell @xcite , @xmath9.\\label{1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath7 is the fine structure constant and @xmath0 is the electron mass .",
    "the notable feature in the above action is the direct coupling of the electromagnetic field to the curvature tensor which in effect violates the strong equivalence principle .",
    "when we consider the equations of motion derived from this action the bianchi identity does not change but it gives rise to curvature dependent modifications to the equation of motion in the form @xmath13 there are some approximations under which this equation of motion was obtained .",
    "the first one is the low frequency approximation in the sense that the derivation is only applicable to wavelengths @xmath14 . by this approximation",
    "we ignore terms in the effective action involving higher order field derivatives .",
    "the second is a weak field approximation for gravity .",
    "this implicitly means that the wavelengths @xmath15 are considered , where @xmath16 is a typical curvature scale . +",
    "the characteristics of the light propagation can be studied by applying the geometric optics approximation .",
    "the electromagnetic field is written in the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the amplitude and @xmath19 is the polarization vector .",
    "the amplitude is taken to be slowly - varying in comparision with @xmath20 . in each small region of space , we can speak of a direction of propagation , normal to a surface at all of whose points the phase of the wave is constant .",
    "if we now identify the wave vector as @xmath21 , the equation governing the components of this vector field for a photon with spacelike , normalized polarization vector i.e , @xmath22 , can be read from ( [ 2 ] ) as @xmath23 eq .

    "they are related through the metric tensor i.e @xmath32 . in the modified theory",

    "this shows that at this level of approximation , qgo can be characterized as a bimetric theory .",
    "the physical light cones are determined by the effective metric @xmath35 , and are distinct from the geomerical null cones which are fixed by the spacetime metric @xmath4 .",
    "( indices are always raised and lowered using the spacetime metric @xmath4 ) .",
    "+ it should be noted that all these equations are manifestly local lorentz invariant though the presence of the explicit curvature coupling in the effective action means different dynamics in the lifs at different points in spacetime . in this sense",
    "these equations violate the strong principle of equivalence ( sep ) .",
    "some of their implications including gravitational birefringence and superluminal speed of light have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 5 ] ) can be employed to examine the sep violating effects which arise in the physical photon congruence . in the present study",
    "we will focus on the modifications produced by the vacuum polarization effects on the propagation of light rays in a curved background .",
    "the physical congruence is specified by the integral curves @xmath36 of the vector field @xmath37 parametrized by the parameter @xmath38 and scaled such that @xmath39 . in order to examine the relation between the neighboring curves of the congruence , the connecting vector field @xmath40",

    "we choose @xmath46 be a null vector along the photon momentum .",

    "these quantities can be defined as @xmath63 in np formalism , they are called `` spin coefficients '' and are designated by the following special symbols @xcite : @xmath64 a general rule to obtain the complex conjugate of any quantity is to replace the index ( 3 ) , wherever it occurs with the index ( 4 ) and vice versa .",
    "+ using the np formalism has some advantages , including the fact that entirely scalar quantities are used .",
    "also a considerable economy of notation is achieved when complex spin coefficients are used instead of the christoffel symbols employed in the conventional coordinate approach .",
    "this formalism is most advantageous if the null tetrads introduced could be completely tied to the geometry of the problem .",
    "otherwise some freedom remains in the choice of the basis as a result of subjecting it to the lorentz transformation .",
    "this has the effect that many of the quantities involved in the calculation are of the same nature as gauge quantities whose values transform in certain ways as the basis frame is varied in accordance with the remaining freedom . in qgo , one null direction is singled out and that is the unperturbed photon momentum which is fixed in the direction of the null vector @xmath46",
    ". therefore the allowed transformation would be those which leave the @xmath46 direction unchanged and preserve the underlying orthogonality and normalization conditions .",
    "these are classified as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a complex function and @xmath18 and @xmath20 are two real functions on the manifold .",
    "we shall now proceed to write down equation ( [ 6 ] ) in the above tetrad basis . before doing",

    "<S> , we study the propagation of a bundle of rays in a background gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> to do so we consider the perturbative deformation of raychaudhuri equation through the influence of vacuum polarization on photon propagation . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the contribution of the above interactions to the optical scalars namely , shear , vorticity and expansion using the newman - penrose formalism . </S>"
