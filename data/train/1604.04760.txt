    "the complete knot floer chain complex @xmath9 is a bifiltered , maslov graded chain complex associated to a knot @xmath1 , introduced by ozsvth and szab @xcite , and independently by rasmussen @xcite . _ a priori _ , the bifiltered chain homotopy type of @xmath9 is an isotopy invariant of the knot @xmath10 . by exploiting the tqft - like aspects of the theory , however , it turns out that @xmath9 also contains a lot of interesting information about the concordance class of @xmath10 , see @xcite for a survey .",
    "one typical example is the ozsvth - szab @xmath3-invariant , which came to stage relatively early and attracted a lot of attention @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath11 is a concordance homomorphism that takes its values in @xmath12 and is defined by examining @xmath13 , which is a small portion of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 provides a lower bound to the smooth four - genus of a knot i.e. @xmath14 . among many applications , oszvth and szab showed that @xmath3 can be used to resolve a conjecture of milnor first proven by kronheimer and mrowka using gauge theory @xcite , that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-torus knot .",
    "recently , by using more information from @xmath9 , ozsvth , stipsicz , and szab introduced a more powerful concordance invariant that generalizes @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this invariant takes the form of a homomorphism from the smooth knot concordance group @xmath18 to the group of piecewise linear functions on @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "thus , for every knot @xmath1 , they associate a piecewise linear function @xmath0 , where @xmath20 $ ] that depends only on the concordance type of @xmath10 .    besides being a concordance homomorphism",
    ", @xmath0 also enjoys many other nice properties , some of which we list below .    *",
    "( symmetry ) @xmath21 * ( 4-genus bound ) @xmath22 for @xmath23 , * ( recovers @xmath3 ) the slope of @xmath0 at @xmath24 is @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    "we study how @xmath26 behaves under the cabling operation .",
    "such results for @xmath3 can be found in @xcite , among which we restate two results .",
    "the first one is due to hedden , obtained by carefully comparing the knot floer chain complex of a knot and that of its cable .",
    "( @xcite)[hed]let @xmath1 be a knot , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath29    later van cott used the genus bound and homomorphism property satisfied by @xmath3 , together with nice constructions of cobordism between cable knots to extend the above inequality to @xmath17-cables .",
    "( @xcite)[vc ] let @xmath1 be a knot , and @xmath17 be a pair of relatively prime numbers such that @xmath27",
    ". then @xmath30    in view of the success in understanding the effect of knot cabling on the @xmath3-invariant , it is natural to wonder what happens to @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we show that a portion of @xmath26 behaves very similarly to @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , adapting the strategies of hedden and van cott on studying @xmath3 to the context of @xmath26 , we can prove the following result :    [ main ] let @xmath1 be a knot , and @xmath17 be a pair of relatively prime numbers such that @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "note that by differentiating the above inequality at @xmath24 , we recover theorem [ vc ] .",
    "one also easily sees this inequality is sharp by examining the case when @xmath10 is the unknot : when @xmath33 , then the upper bound is achieved , and when @xmath34 the lower bound is achieved . however , when @xmath35 the behavior of @xmath2 for @xmath36 $ ] is still unknown to the author .",
    "+ theorem [ main ] can often be used to determine the @xmath26 function of cables with limited knowledge of their complete knot floer chain complexes . for an example , we show how our theorem can be used to deduce @xmath4 for @xmath5 ; these examples are , on the face of it , rather difficult to compute , since none of them is an @xmath37-space knot . despite this , armed only with theorem [ main ] and the knot",
    "floer homology groups of the knots in this family , we are able to obtain complete knowledge of @xmath26 .",
    "perhaps more striking , however , theorem [ main ] can be used to easily show that certain subsets of the smooth concordance group freely generate infinite - rank summands .",
    "to this end , let @xmath38 be the untwisted positive whitehead double of the trefoil knot and let @xmath39 denote the @xmath40-fold iterated @xmath6-cable of @xmath41 for some fixed @xmath42 and some positive integer @xmath40 .",
    "theorem [ main ] , together with general properties of @xmath26 , yield the following    [ cor ] the family of knots @xmath43 for @xmath44 are linearly independent in @xmath18 and span an infinite - rank summand consisting of topologically slice knots .    to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge , corollary [ cor ] provides the first satellite operator on the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots whose iterates ( for a fixed knot ) are known to be independent ; moreover , in this case they are a summand .",
    "note @xmath43 has trivial alexander polynomial .",
    "the first known example of infinite - rank summand of knots with trivial alexander polynomial is generated by @xmath45 for @xmath46 , due to kim and park @xcite .",
    "their example , however , like the families of topologically slice knots studied by @xcite , involved rather non - trivial calculuatons of @xmath26 ( for instance , those of @xcite involved rather technical caclulations with the bordered floer invariants ) .",
    "the utility of theorem [ main ] is highlighted by the ease with which the above family is handled .",
    "we also refer the interested reader to @xcite for a host of other applications of theorem [ main ] to the study of the knot concordance group . + to conclude the introduction , it is worth mentioning that hom achieved a complete understanding of the behavior of @xmath3 under cabling by introducing the @xmath47-invariant @xcite . in particular , @xmath48 is always one of the two bounds appearing in theorem [ vc ] , depending on the value of @xmath49 .",
    "however , in the context of @xmath26 the story is not true , even for @xmath37-space knots whose knot floer chain complexes are relatively simple .",
    "for instance , @xmath50 is computed in @xcite but it does not equal either bound appearing in theorem [ main ] .",
    "this suggests the behavior of @xmath26 under cabling is more complicated .",
    "for example , it would be interesting if one can find suitable auxiliary invariants serving a similar role as @xmath47-invariant .",
    "+ * outline . *",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as following : in section 2 , we review the definition of @xmath26 . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove our main theorem . in section 4",
    "we give two applications of theorem [ main ] .",
    "i wish to thank my advisor matt hedden , for teaching me with great patience , and lending me his vision through wonderful suggestions that shape this work .",
    "i also thank andrew donald and kouki sato for many nice comments on earlier versions of this paper .",
    "we work over @xmath51 throughout the entire paper .",
    "we also assume that the reader is familiar with the basic setup of knot floer homology . for more details , see @xcite .    in this section , we will briefly review the construction of @xmath0 of a given knot @xmath10 , setting up some notations at the same time .",
    "the original definition of @xmath0 is based on a @xmath52-modified knot floer chain complex , see @xcite . shortly thereafter , livingston reformulated @xmath0 in terms of the complete knot floer chain complex @xmath9 .",
    "we find it convenient to work with livingston s definition , which we recall below .",
    "denote @xmath9 by @xmath53 for convenience .",
    "note that @xmath53 comes with a @xmath54-filtration , namely the alexander filtration and the algebraic filtration .",
    "actually , to be more precise , @xmath53 is only well defined up to bifiltered chain homotopy equivalence , unless we fix some compatible heegaard diagram for @xmath10 and some auxiliary data .",
    "now for any @xmath20 $ ] , one can define a filtration on @xmath53 as follows .",
    "first , define a real - valued ( grading ) function on @xmath53 by @xmath55 which is a convex linear combination of alexander and algebraic gradings .",
    "associated to this function , one can construct a filtration given by @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the filtration induced by @xmath57 is compatible with the differential of @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 here @xmath61 stands for the homology group with maslov grading @xmath62 . with these preparations ,",
    "@xmath26 is defined as following .",
    "@xmath63 .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that the above definition of @xmath0 is equivalent to the one given by ozsvth , stipsicz , and szab in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] will be divided into two parts : in subsection 3.1 we will prove the inequality for the @xmath64 cable of a knot by adapting hedden s strategy in @xcite , and then in subsection 3.2 we will upgrade the inequality to cover the @xmath17-cable of a knot by applying van cott s argument in @xcite .      following @xcite , we will begin with introducing a nice heegaard diagram which encodes both the original knot @xmath10 and its cable @xmath65 .    for any knot @xmath1 , there exists a compatible heegaard diagram @xmath66",
    ". moreover , by stabilizing we can assume @xmath67 to be the meridian of the knot @xmath10 and that it only intersects @xmath68 , and there is a @xmath62-framed longitude of the knot @xmath10 on @xmath69 which does not intersect @xmath68 . from now on",
    ", we will always assume that the heegaard diagram @xmath70 for @xmath10 satisfies all these properties .",
    "let @xmath66 be a heegaard diagram for the knot @xmath10 as above . by modifying @xmath67 and adding an extra base point @xmath71",
    ", we can construct a new heegaard diagram with three base points @xmath72 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath73 is obtained by winding @xmath67 along an @xmath40-framed longitude @xmath74 times , and the new base point @xmath71 is placed at the tip of the winding region such that the arc @xmath75 connecting @xmath76 and @xmath71 has intersection number @xmath77 with @xmath73 .",
    "note @xmath73 can be deformed to @xmath67 through an isotopy that does not cross the base points @xmath78 .",
    "see figure  [ longitude ] and figure  [ winding ] for an example .",
    "the power of @xmath79 lies in the fact that it specifies both @xmath10 and @xmath65 at the same time , as pointed out by the following lemma .",
    "( lemma 2.2 of @xcite ) let @xmath79 be a heegaard diagram described as above .",
    "then    1 .   ignoring @xmath71",
    ", we get a doubly - pointed diagram @xmath80 which specifies @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   ignoring @xmath81",
    ", we get a doubly - pointed diagram @xmath82 which specifies the cable knot @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that the two knot floer chain complexes @xmath83 and @xmath84 are closely related .",
    "more precisely , by forgetting the alexander filtrations , both @xmath83 and @xmath84 are isomorphic to @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , in order to get a more transparent correspondence between these two complexes , we will compare the alexander gradings of the intersection points with respect to the two different base points @xmath81 and @xmath71 .",
    "for the sake of a clearer discussion , we fix some notation and terminology to deal with the intersection points . for convenience ,",
    "we assume @xmath86 through out the discussion and remark that the case when @xmath87 can be handled in a similar way . note @xmath73",
    "intersects @xmath68 at @xmath88 points , and we label them as @xmath89 , ... , @xmath90 , starting at the out - most layer from left to right , and then the second layer from left to right , and so on . on the other hand , @xmath73 could also intersect other @xmath91-curves besides @xmath68 , and we label these points by @xmath92 , ... , @xmath93 . here",
    "@xmath94 enumerates the intersections of the @xmath40-framed longitude with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and the order of this enumeration is irrelevant .",
    "the lower index is again ordered following a layer by layer convention , from outside to inside , but we require that _ @xmath97 can be connected to @xmath98 by an arc on @xmath73 which neither intersects @xmath99 nor @xmath75 _ , the short arcs connecting the base points .",
    "see figure  [ winding ] for an example .",
    "the generators will be partitioned into @xmath77 classes : all the generators of the form @xmath100 or @xmath101 will be called _ even intersection points _ or _",
    "@xmath62-intersection points _ , and _ odd intersection points _ otherwise ; odd generators of the form @xmath102 or @xmath103 will be called _",
    "@xmath104-intersection points_. here @xmath105 are @xmath106-tuple in @xmath107 .",
    "note that essentially we are classifying odd intersection points into @xmath74 classes by the following principle : if its @xmath73-component sits on the @xmath108-th layer ( we count the layers from outside to inside ) , then it is called a @xmath109-intersection point .",
    "we denote the alexander grading by @xmath110 ( by @xmath111 ) when we use the base point @xmath81 ( base point @xmath71 ) .",
    "the comparison of alexander filtrations is summarized in the following proposition .",
    "[ comparison ] with the choice of heegaard diagrams as described above and let @xmath112 be an @xmath113-intersection point , where @xmath114 , then @xmath115    proposition [ comparison ] can be viewed as a generalization of the comparison used in@xcite , in which only @xmath116 for @xmath117 were shown to satisfy the above equation . in studying @xmath3 , having just a comparison for @xmath116 for @xmath117 would suffice : first",
    ", hedden observed that in the case when @xmath118 is sufficiently large they account for the top alexander graded generators of @xmath119 that determine @xmath120 ; second , the behavior of @xmath3 for small @xmath40 can be deduced from the large-@xmath40 case by using crossing change inequality of @xmath3 . in contrast , the lower alexander graded elements of @xmath121 may play a role in @xmath26 , even though they do not affect @xmath3 .",
    "therefore in the current paper we have to carry out a comparison for all types of generators .",
    "to accomplish this goal , we quote and extend some of the lemmas used in @xcite below , after which proposition [ comparison ] will follow easily .    when @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 @xmath124    for an arbitrary @xmath94 , when @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 @xmath127    note that there is a whitney disk @xmath128 connecting @xmath129 to @xmath130 ( see figure  [ winding ] ) .",

    "note @xmath92 and @xmath153 can be joined by an arc on @xmath73 satisfying the aforementioned property ( see figure  [ epsilonclass2 ] for an example ) .",
    "recall by our convention , @xmath97 can be connected to @xmath98 by an arc on @xmath73 which neither intersects @xmath99 nor @xmath75 , hence equation ( 3.7 ) follows .",
