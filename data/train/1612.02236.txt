    "in order to determine the positions and motions of astronomical objects on the sky , astrometry uses light signals ( photons ) which are emitted by the celestial objects .",
    "these light rays propagate from the celestial light source through the gravitational field of the solar system and do finally arrive at the observer .",
    "therefore , the precise determination of the trajectories of light signals through the warped space - time of solar system is a fundamental assignment of a task in relativistic astrometry . according to the theory of general relativity @xcite light rays propagate along null - geodesics governed by the geodesic equation , @xmath0    where ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) represents the geodesic equation and the constraint ( [ isotropic_condition1 ] ) must be imposed for null - geodesics which states that the tangent four - vector along light rays is isotropic . in ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) and ( [ isotropic_condition1 ] ) the four - coordinates of a light - signal @xmath1 depend on affine parameter @xmath2 , and the christoffel symbols in ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] )",
    "are related to the metric @xmath3 of curved space - time , @xmath4    with metric signature @xmath5 . the geodesic equation",
    "( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) and the isotropic condition ( [ isotropic_condition1 ] ) are valid in any reference system . with the aid of the zeroth component of ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) , the geodesic equation and",
    "the isotropic condition can be expressed in terms of coordinate time @xmath6 rather than the affine parameter @xmath2 as follows @xcite , @xmath7    while the zeroth component in ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) vanishes identically .",
    "the equations in ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) and ( [ isotropic_condition2 ] ) are more appropriate in order to integrate the geodesic equation and also in view of the fact that real astrometric measurements do by all means imply the use of concrete reference systems . in line with the resolutions of international astronomical union ( iau ) @xcite , the barycentric celestial reference system ( bcrs ) is adopted , which is the standard global chart in modern - day astrometry . the origin of the spatial axes of the bcrs is located at the barycenter of the solar system , the harmonic coordinates of the bcrs are denoted by @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the bcrs coordinate time and @xmath9 are the three - dimensional coordinates referred to the spatial axes of the bcrs , and obey the harmonic gauge condition ( de donder gauge ) : @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the determinant of metric tensor .    for a unique solution of the geodesic equation ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) mixed initial - boundary conditions",

    "defines the spatial coordinates of the photon at the moment @xmath13 of emission of light .",
    "the second condition ( [ initial_boundary_condition_2 ] ) defines the unit - direction of the light ray at past null infinity , that means the unit - tangent vector along the light path in the infinite past hence at infinite spatial distance from the origin of the global coordinate system .",
    "then , the exact solution of ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) for the trajectory of the light ray , propagating from the light source through the solar system towards the observer , can formally be written as follows , @xmath14    where the term @xmath15 denotes gravitational corrections to the unperturbed light ray .    in case of weak gravitational fields",
    "it is useful to decompose the metric tensor as follows , @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the metric of minkowskian space and for any components of the metric perturbations @xmath18 . because the gravitational fields are weak in the solar system , the orbital motions of the solar system bodies are slow ( virial theorem ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 (",
    "notations are given in the appendix [ appendix_notation ] ) , hence an expansion of the metric in terms of inverse powers of the speed of light can be applied , called post - newtonian expansion or weak - field slow - motion approximation @xcite , which for the covariant and contravariant components reads @xmath21    where @xmath22 with @xmath23 ; e.g. eqs .  ( 4.17 ) - ( 4.19 ) in @xcite . notice that the post - newtonian expansion in ( [ post_newtonian_metric_b ] ) describes the metric in the near - zone of the solar system defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a characteristic wavelength of gravitational radiation emitted by the solar system .",
    "it should be mentioned that , according to the famous theorem in @xcite , the post - newtonian expansion of the metric tensor is , in fact , non - analytic because it contains logarithmic terms . however , in the near - zone the post - newtonian expansion in inverse powers of the speed of light is valid up to 4pn approximation , that means logarithmic terms in metric coefficients emerge at the order of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the post - newtonian expansion of the metric in ( [ post_newtonian_metric_b ] ) inherits a corresponding post - newtonian expansion of the light trajectory ( [ introduction_5 ] ) , which up to terms of the order @xmath27 reads @xmath28    where the label @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 refer to terms of the order @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "each individual body @xmath38 is allowed to move along its own arbitrary worldline @xmath39 and the global metric of the solar system has been described in terms of the full set of time - dependent intrinsic mass - multipoles @xmath40 and full set of time - dependent intrinsic spin - multipoles @xmath41 , allowing for arbitrary shape , inner structure and rotational motion of the massive bodies of the solar system . about the magnitude of these terms in time - delay and light deflection",
    "we refer to table ii and table iii in @xcite",
    ".    however , rapidly growing accuracy in astrometric measurements demands to account for post - post - newtonian terms @xmath42 as well .",
    "in particular , it is well - known that present - day precision in astrometry has reached a level of a few micro - arcseconds ( @xmath43 ) in angular observations of stars @xcite and a level of a few nano - seconds ( @xmath44 ) in measurements of time delay @xcite .",
    "such extremely high - precision astrometry necessitates to account for 2pn effects in the theory of light propagation @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "results about the post - post - newtonian terms @xmath42 in ( [ introduction_6 ] ) are fairly rare .",
    "so far , 2pn effects in light propagation have mainly been determined for the case of mass monopoles at rest @xcite , that means where the position of the mass monopole remains constant : @xmath45 . in this respect ,",
    "an important progress in calculating post - post - newtonian effects on light propagation in the monopole field has been achieved in @xcite where an explicit 2pn solution for light trajectories in the schwarzschild field as function of coordinate time has been found and later been confirmed within several progressing investigations @xcite . also alternative approaches for the calculation of directions of light rays and their propagation time in 2pn approximation have been developed , which avoid the peculiarities of solving the null geodesic equations , based on the eikonal concept @xcite , on the synge s world function @xcite or on the time transfer function formalism @xcite .",
    "an ambitious goal in astrometric measurements in near future is to aim at sub - micro - arcsecond ( sub- ) level in angular determination and sub - nano - second ( sub - ns ) level in time delay measurements .",
    "for instance , several space - based astrometry missions are under discussion which have been proposed to the european space agency ( esa ) which aim at precisions on sub - nano - arcsecond ( sub - nas ) level in angular determination of celestial objects @xcite .",
    "such extremely high - precision astrometry needs to account for the impact of the motion of massive bodies on the light propagation in 2pn approximation .",
    "the problem , however , of light propagation in the field of moving monopoles in 2pn approximation has not been considered yet , aside from the investigation in @xcite which was not intended for the problem of light propagation in the solar system .",
    "for this reason , we will consider the problem of light propagation through the gravitational field of one pointlike body in slow but otherwise arbitrary motion in the 2pn approximation .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ section2 ] the geodesic equation in 2pn approximation is presented , in section [ section3 ] the metric of one massive pointlike body in arbitrary motion in 2pn approximation is given , in section [ section4 ] and section [ section5 ] the first and second integration of geodesic equation is represented .",

    "i.e. the term @xmath49 , is a peculiarity in the sense that this term is seemingly of the order @xmath27 , but by inspection of ( [ metric_4 ] ) one realizes that the first integration ( [ integral_1 ] ) of this term results into @xmath50 which is of the order @xmath34 , and , therefore , can not be neglected .",

    "consequently , the derivatives in ( [ geodesic_equation3 ] ) are taken along the light ray : @xmath55    the geodesic equation in 2pn approximation in ( [ geodesic_equation3 ] ) can be solved by iteration and allows to determine the coordinate velocity ( first integration ) and the light trajectory ( second integration ) up to terms of the order @xmath27 : @xmath56    as mentioned above , the 1pn and 1.5pn terms in ( [ light_trajectory_2pn_a ] ) and ( [ light_trajectory_2pn_b ] ) have recently been determined in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for the case of @xmath37 bodies in slow but otherwise arbitrary motion and the bodies may have arbitrary shape and inner structure and can be in arbitrary rotational motion .",
