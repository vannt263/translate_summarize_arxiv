    "in flute - like instruments , acoustic oscillation is generated by the coupling of the unstable modes of an air jet and the acoustic modes of a pipe resonator .",
    "for soft blowing conditions , the jet is laminar and the instability is usually described , following rayleigh s approach ( @xcite ) , under assumptions of infinite inviscid 2-d flow .",
    "certainly this approach needs to be combined with ad - hoc assumptions to cope with the specific geometry of the problem ( semi - infinite jet , acoustic transverse perturbation ) .",
    "furthermore , because it is linear , this perturbation approach may be limited to small amplitudes of jet deflection .",
    "for many instruments like transverse flutes and popular music flutes , the sound power required calls for higher total jet flux .",
    "reynolds numbers , based on jet thickness and velocity , up to 10000 have been estimated in transverse flutes . under such conditions ,",
    "the jet becomes rapidly turbulent downstream from the flue exit .",
    "the development of instability induced by the acoustic perturbation on such jets has been studied by bechert ( @xcite , @xcite ) and fletcher ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both propose semi - empirical models to describe the jet oscillations .",
    "the intimate detail of the coupling between the acoustic perturbation and the jet instability remain an unsolved problem .",
    "it appears that for both laminar and turbulent jets , the lack of theoretical models make experimental data useful to fit , calibrate and evaluate semi - empirical models ( @xcite ) .",
    "different researchers have studied experimentally jet oscillations under acoustical perturbations using hot - wire anemometry measurements ( @xcite , @xcite for example ) . on the other hand ,",
    "flow visualization has been widely used as an inspiration for a physical analysis and description of the fluid mechanisms and aeroacoustics at work in flutes ( @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present tools for image analysis of flow visualizations to extract quantitative data on jet instability under acoustic perturbation .",
    "the development of instability on a jet is experimentally investigated using a simplified device ( see section [ s : device ] ) : the pipe resonator is removed from the flute and replaced by an acoustic field generated by loudspeakers . using the schlieren technique , flow visualizations",
    "have been carried out for a variety of reynolds and strouhal numbers .",
    "two different image analysis techniques have been developed ( see sections [ s : imag_proc ] and [ s : valid ] ) and they are discussed in detail in this paper .",
    "the extracted data is analyzed in the framework of a harmonic perturbation that is convected downstream and grows in the shear layers of the jet ( see section [ s : results ] ) .",
    "finally , the influence of the reynolds number and the channel geometry on the jet behavior are presented as an application in section [ s : disc ] .",
    "[ [ experimental - setup ] ] experimental setup : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a jet , created by blowing through a slit , is acoustically forced by two out - of - phase loudspeakers ( see figure [ fig : manip_speaker_sensor ] )",
    ".        the speed of the jet is controled by varying the pressure in the cavity @xmath0 just before the jet formation .",
    "the jet central speed at the channel exit @xmath1 , can be estimated using bernoulli s equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fluid density .",
    "[ [ jet - structure ] ] jet structure : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    two reynolds numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 were chosen ( @xmath6 , with @xmath7 m the channel height and @xmath8 the kinematic viscosity ) .",
    "they correspond to two different operating modes of the jet : @xmath9 gives a velocity around 7.5 m / s which corresponds to a normal blowing condition for a recorder and assures a laminar behavior , while @xmath10 corresponds to a velocity around 45 m / s producing a turbulent jet .",
    "the acoustic excitation frequency @xmath11 is ranging from 70 to 1400 hz ( when @xmath9 ) and from 1200 to 2900hz ( when @xmath10 ) to cover a strouhal ( @xmath12 ) range from approximately 0.05 to 1.15 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a fixed amplitude of the acoustic velocity is chosen for each of the two experiments described in the present paper and a typical value is @xmath14 of the jet velocity observed in real flutes but allows us to cover an interesting range of frequencies without over exciting the speakers . ] .",
    "the acoustic velocity is measured using a microflown velocity sensor ( low amplitudes ) and a microphone doublet ( high amplitudes ) at a position near the unperturbed jet path , but out of the flow visualization window .",
    "preliminary experiment had been carried out to check the acoustic velocity homogeneity in the jet and sensor area .",
    "[ [ schlieren - jet - images ] ] schlieren jet images : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    schlieren technique ( @xcite , section 3.2.2 p134 ) is used to observe the behavior of the oscillating jet : using an optical scheme , light phase shift crossing an inhomogeneous media is converted into light intensity ( see figure [ fig : lens_array ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath15 jet traversing the air , whose mass density assures enough difference to allow schlieren visualization ( see figure [ fig : realjet ] ) while producing a behavior close to that found in real flute - like instruments .",
    "sequential images of the jet are taken with a digital camera synchronized with a stroboscopic lighte .",
    "its frequency is set such that multiples of its frequency are slightly out of phase with the excitation frequency providing an aliased representation of the oscillation .",

    "a knife edge , placed in the focus of the second lens blocks part of the rays having crossed s , thus producing intensity variations on the screen ( see figure [ fig : realjet ] ) . ]     for the optical principle ) . ]",
    "the goal of the image processing algorithm is to detect transverse jet displacement for every image in the oscillation period .",
    "two algorithms are proposed in this section .",
    "their performances will be checked and compared in section [ s : valid ] and [ s : results ] respectively .      a first algorithm based on cross - correlation between successive images is proposed .",
    "let us consider the intensity graph of one column of the image as shown in figure [ fig : intensity ] ( left picture ) .",
    "for that particular column , the shape of the graph does not change much as time goes on : the shape is only shifted , according to the transverse position @xmath19 in the @xmath20 direction due to the movement of the jet .",
    "however , the particular shape varies with the column considered since it is determined by the mass distribution of the jet as shown in figure [ fig : realjet ] .",
    "[ fig : crosscorrelation ]    cross - correlation is calculated between two intensity graphs corresponding to the same column of two successive images of the sequence ( see right part of figure [ fig : crosscorrelation ] ) .",
    "the position of the peak allows to measure the displacement of the jet between these two successive images .",
    "this is repeated for each column of the image .",
    "since changes on the jet position may be smaller than one pixel , a parabola is fitted to the three highest points to estimate the position of the peak . when considering all the columns of all the images in the sequence , the jet position can be reconstructed as shown in figure [ fig : position_mesh_crosscor ] ( @xmath4 and @xmath21 ) .     and @xmath21 ]",
    "[ fig : position_mesh_morpho ]    some defects of the experimental setup are clearly visible in left part of figure [ fig : intensity ] : the two peaks corresponding to the brighter and darker part of the image should ideally be of the same height , but in practice a symetrical contrast is very difficult to obtain",
    ". moreover , unhomogenous background intensity ( inside each image ) is represented as a non horizontal line on the borders of the left image in figure [ fig : intensity ] .",
    "however , these features of the images are useful for the cross - correlation since they help to produce the well shaped peak in the curve observed in the right part of figure [ fig : crosscorrelation ] .      the idea of this method is to apply morphologic functions on binarized images , in order to identify large spatial scales , corresponding to the jet main structure , while ignoring the smallest scales ( vortices , background noise ... ) .",
    "this is done through the five following steps ( also illustrated in figure [ morpho_illust ] ) :    [ [ contrast - enhancement - and - homogenization - between - all - the - images - of - a - sequence - figure - morpho_illustb ] ] contrast enhancement and homogenization between all the images of a sequence ( figure [ morpho_illust]b ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the contrast is first enhanced by histogram equalization ; the histogram of each image is streched to lie on the full 8-bit range , and to match a flat histogram .",
    "this also plays the role of contrast homogenisation between different images of a given sequence .",
    "[ [ conversion - from - greyscale - to - black - and - white - images - figure - morpho_illustc ] ] conversion from greyscale to black and white images ( figure [ morpho_illust]c ) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    : a statistical method based on the otsu principle estimates the threshold which best separates the histogram within two classes ( @xcite ) . the binarization threshold is therefore different for each image . as a global method",
    ", the efficiency of the otsu method is known to vary according to the type of image .",
    "a classical improvement is adopted , which consists in multiplying the otsu threshold by an empirical constant in order to better enhance the jet structure for a given sequence of image .",
    "typical values for this constant lie beween 0.9 and 1.1 . in the resulting bw images ,",
    "the jet is represented by a lower and a upper half jet , black and white respectively ( figure [ morpho_illust]c ) . in the following ,",
    "both half jets are treated separately  : the same operations are applied to the bw image and to its 1-complemented image . for clarity , only operations on the image containing the lower half jet are shown in figures [ morpho_illust]d , [ morpho_illust]e and [ morpho_illust]f .    [ [ extraction - of - largest - spatial - scales - in - the - image - figures - morpho_illustd - and - morpho_illuste ] ] extraction of largest spatial scales in the image ( figures [ morpho_illust]d and [ morpho_illust]e ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for each half - jet , the black and white picture includes several black structures , among which the half jet . this image is usually noisy , with black dots or small - sized sets of black pixels on the background .",
    "this can result either from a non - optimal threshold , or from the schlieren experiment itself , which does not produce perfectly uniform backgrounds ( mainly because the optical lens are never dispersion free ) .",
    "therefore , a morphological closure ( @xcite ) is performed to clean all small structures ( figure [ morpho_illust]d ) . then a morphological opening is applied in order to highlight large scales in the image ( figure [ morpho_illust]e ) .",
    "the structuring element is a disk , the size of which ( optimized manually ) , is the same for all the images of a given sequence .",
    "[ [ identification - of - the - half - jet - among - the - remaining - large - scales - figure - morpho_illustf ] ] identification of the half - jet among the remaining large scales ( figure [ morpho_illust]f ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the image is decomposed into different regions , defined as groups of contiguous pixels",
    ". a unique region , corresponding to the estimated half - jet , must be retained . however , since the jet is oscillating , sometimes with large amplitudes , its position may vary significantly between different images of the same sequence",
    ". therefore the discriminating criterion retained , involves both the area and the localization of each region and uses the ( known ) main flow direction from left to right ) .",

    "edge detection is interesting in order to analyse in further studies the spreading of the jet as a function of the distance from the exit .",
    "moreover , it is an intermediate step to estimate the median line , which we are mainly interested in .",
    "finally , an image containing edges of both half jets is scanned column after column and the median line is constructed point after point , including empirical criteria to select , among several possible paths , the one to follow .",
    "this guarantees that the resulting median line is single - valued , but possibly discontinuous in the case of vortices .",
    "[ [ structure - length ] ] structure length : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the largest the distance from the exit , the most complex the structure of the jet , and the least reliable the estimation of the median line . an index of confidence is then used : the estimation of the median line stops at the distance ( i.e. the column ) corresponding to the length of the smallest half - jet . indeed beyond that limit , median line estimation would rely on information given by a single half - jet ( as can be seen in figure [ im_med_line ] ) .",
    "this distance depends on the experimental conditions ( reynolds and strouhal numbers ) but obviously varies from an image to another within a sequence , depending both on the phase of the excitation ( whether the jet is horizontal or deflected ) , and on the image itself ( the whole process of jet identification being more or less efficient from an image to another ) .",
    "the result of this method on one image is presented in figure [ im_med_line ] .",
    "bringing together the median line found for each image allows to construct 3d plots similar to those obtained through cross - correlation image analysis ( figure [ fig : position_mesh_morpho ] ) .",
    "cc    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "two applications of the proposed methods are presented within this section .",
    "the results obtained with cross - correlation and morphological methods can be compared in a more general way by considering the evolution of the estimated parameters as function of the frequency in the case of a laminar ( figure [ fig : summ_lam_cp ] ) and a turbulent ( figure  [ fig : summ_tur_cp ] ) jet .",
    "the mean convection velocity of the perturbation on the jet ( defined as the mean slope of the phase shift ) appears to be nearly independent of the frequency of oscillation .",
    "this is true for a laminar jet as well as for a turbulent jet . in the former case , @xmath23 and in the latter @xmath24 .",
    "these results have to be compared with the rayleigh ideal linear jet for which @xmath25 varies between @xmath26 and @xmath27 depending on the jet velocity profile .",
    "the values found are also in agreement with values suggested by other authors ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    a closer look at the evolution of the phase with the distance @xmath28 from flue exit indicates a higher convection velocity at short distances from flue exit ( a downward bending is observed ) .",
    "this can be interpreted both in terms of the slowing down of the jet velocity and of the smoothing of the jet velocity profile , both induced by the viscosity .",
    "a fit of the phase with a power law reveals that the speed of the jet decreases as a function of @xmath29 in the laminar case ( mean value obtained from all the excitation frequencies available ) and as a function of @xmath30 in the turbulent case ( mean value on all excitations frequencies also ) . from @xcite ( p133 and p323 ) the jet centerline velocity in the laminar case",
    "is expected to decrease as @xmath31 , while the decrease is much faster in the case of a turbulent jet since the jet centerline velocity follows @xmath32 .",
    "the fitted values appear to be very close to the theoretical values , even if it should be noted that the dispersion around the mean value is important , due to experimental problems for some frequencies .",
    "however , this approach appears promising and could be extended to tackle the detection of the transition from laminar to turbulence in a jet .",
    "another application of the methods presented can be illustrated by the comparison of different flue channel geometries , as studied by segoufin @xcite .",
    "convection velocities of perturbations on jets issuing from long ( 27 mm ) and short ( 1 mm ) channels are compared .",
    "both channels show the same thickness @xmath33 mm . in the case of the short channel with squared exit ,",
    "the convection velocity is clearly higher than in the other cases , confirming the observations done by sgoufin @xcite in the context of edge - tones .",
    "this can be interpreted , as suggested by sgoufin , in terms of the boundary layers thickness of the jet , which becomes thinner in the case of short channel .",
    "the present experiment was carried using the channels also used by segoufin , and our results strongly correlate with segoufin s results and interpretation .",
    "compared to hot - wire anemometry , flow visualization allows a non intrusive measurement as well as a clear identification of the jet as composed of fluid particles issuing from the flue channed ( streaklines , @xcite ) . on the other hand , flow visualizations",
    "does not give direct information on the velocity field ( streamlines ) and requires the use of a gas of different light refraction than that of the surrounding air .",
    "the images obtained by the schlieren method are extremely sensible to variations on the setup .",
    "the position of the blade , the aperture of the diaphragm , the alignment of the optics , the saturation curve of the acquisition software , the vertical and horizontal position of the jet , etc .",
    "are some of the parameters that needs to be adjusted for each experiment .",
    "small differences on these parameters produce image variations . therefore , even under a attentive care , images obtained from any two experiments are different .",
    "both methods allow to estimate fairly well the amplitude as well as phase evolution of the perturbation .",
    "the main difference is that the cross - correlation method performs an inter - image analysis while the morphological method is an intra - image technique .",
    "moreover , to achieve its best results the morphological method needs to be manually calibrated for each sequence of images while the cross - correlation method can be completely automate .",
    "the resolution of the detection is restricted to one pixel in the morphological method while continuous for the cross - correlation .",
    "turbulent jet and noisy images seem to be better handled by the morphological method while the cross - correlation is preferred for laminar jets .",
    "the two methods we developped give very close results in terms of jet amplification and convection velocities for a wide range of control parameters .",
    "together with the interpretation of results presented by segoufin using the same channels , this indicates that both methods can be reliable and useful to the study of jet oscillation in edge - tones and flute - like instruments .",
