    "the h@xmath2  luminosity function of hii  regions in bcdgs covers the range @xmath60@xmath61ergs@xmath5 , and seems to follow those of larger nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "hii  regions with h@xmath2  luminosities on the order of @xmath62ergs@xmath5 ( the top percentile of the hii  region luminosity function ) are of particular interest as they are the hosts of the most extreme star formation events , which drive the evolution of galaxies . for comparison",

    "this is often the case because low mass companions often have a high gas fraction and are therefore visible in hi  emission .",

    "an example of a merger - induced star formation event in a dwarf system is sbs1319 + 579 @xcite , where long slit spectroscopy revealed differing velocity components for the merging systems .",
    "luminous hii  regions can also be created stochastically by processes internal to a galaxy .",
    "for example , star formation could either be triggered by density waves propagating through an irregular distribution of hi  @xcite or solely by the gravitational collapse of a gas cloud within the galaxy disc @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed the sfrs and specific - sfrs ( ssfrs ) of low - mass ( @xmath67@xmath4 ) galaxies within the gama - i survey and concluded that their star formation histories ( sfhs ) require stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed onto an underlying exponentially declining sfh .",

    "gama assigns it one companion , gamaj141120.29 - 002950.8 , which is @xmath177  arcmin , to the north - east and a physical separation of @xmath178mpc .",
    "there is no other catalogued companion ( gama or sdss ) within 300kms@xmath5 and a 20  arcmin radius of gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3",
    ". visual inspection of optical ( sdss , @xmath179 ) and nir ( 2mass , k@xmath180 ) imaging for this region revealed no indication of companion galaxies similar to or larger than gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 .",
    "the hipass data revealed a significant amount of hi  in the vicinity of gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 , indicating @xmath19/@xmath18@xmath114 , with @xmath17(@xmath109/@xmath4)@xmath181 ( lmc @xmath17(@xmath109/@xmath4)@xmath182 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the galaxy potentially has access to a large reservoir of neutral gas .",
    "the apparent lower metallicity of the hii  complex may suggest that the gas feeding the star formation has fallen in from the outer parts of the hi  disc following its expulsion during a previous episode of activity . alternatively , the gas may have been supplied by an interaction with a companion galaxy as has been seen previously in other dg systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the gas fraction with respect to the stellar mass and metallicity is not abnormal for similar galaxies @xcite .",
    "a lower mass companion that is less obvious could play a part , as seen in tol 30 where an hi  tail extends towards a smaller dwarf galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lpez - snchez et al . _ in prep _ ) . with no obvious companion near gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 , and the fact that any galaxy too faint to be detected in the sdss image would have an even more extreme gas / star ratio , the origin of the hi  gas from a previous interaction is both unlikely and unnecessary .",
    "only with resolved hi  mapping of the region around gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 can a conclusion of its role on the hii  complex be made .",
    "the use of the term ` hii  complex ' in this work highlights the unresolved nature of this region , which warrants caution when deriving physical quantities .",
    "@xcite showed that the h@xmath2  flux of hii  regions can contribute up to @xmath183  per  cent of the total h@xmath2  flux of a nearly well - resolved galaxy , but up to @xmath184  per  cent in the case where the spatial smoothing has been applied .",
    "this occurs because what used to be resolved hii  regions have now become an hii  complex due to the smoothing . due to this , such unresolved hii  complexes are likely host to a collection of smaller hii  regions , but it has been found that it is more likely for the convolution of smaller hii  regions to produce an even light distribution instead of a point source distribution appearing as a single hii  region @xcite . if dwarf galaxies with intense star forming regions are remnants of the same evolutionary phase that clump - clusters went through , it is not unrealistic for this hii  complex to be dominated by a single hii  region ( alike to 30  doradus ) . with clump - clusters growth being dominated not by merging activity , but rather smooth gaseous inflow @xcite , the high gas fraction and isolation of gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 strengthens the scenario of stochastic gravitational collapse as opposed to interaction triggered star formation .",
    "the hii  complex has a measured h@xmath2  luminosity of @xmath185ergs@xmath5 , velocity dispersion @xmath186  kms@xmath5and a diameter of @xmath187pc .",
    "this agrees with the scaling relations found by @xcite for high-@xmath11 @xmath188@xmath189 galaxies ( e.g. clump - clusters ; velocity dispersion @xmath190 radius @xmath190 h@xmath2  luminosity @xmath190 jeans mass ) , even though the hii  complex analysed here is hosted in a dwarf galaxy . in comparison to the work by @xcite ,",
    "the sfr and ssfr of gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 including the hii  complex are average for other galaxies of similar stellar mass",
    ". however , the sfr and ssfr of gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 excluding the hii  complex are at the extreme lower bounds for the same mass bin .",
    "this hints at a case where the star formation in such dwarf galaxies are typically dominated by a similar , single hii  complex .",
    "taking into account gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 s high gas fraction , we conclude that even though this hii  complex is significant for the galaxy itself ( contributing @xmath167  per  cent of the total sfr of the galaxy ) , it is not currently experiencing a burst in its sfh where most of its stellar mass is formed .",
    "this is consistent with the work of @xcite , which found that dwarf galaxies formed their underlying stellar population ( accounting for @xmath191  per  cent of their stellar mass ) prior to @xmath192 , with the rest of the stellar mass being formed by younger starbursts happening over the last 1 billion years .",
    "these findings lead to the questions : 1 . where do the intense star forming regions of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath193@xmath194 ) lie on known scaling relations of clump - clusters ?",
    "what fraction of dwarf galaxies are undergoing extreme star formation in localised hii  complexes and what is their duty cycle ?",
    "these questions are outside the scope of this paper , but suit well to future analysis of a sample of dwarf galaxies obtained with instruments such as sami , kmos and manga . considering the sami galaxy survey will observe @xmath74 dwarf galaxies over the next few years , it will be possible to rigorously test this sample for more galaxies like gamaj141103.98 - 003242.3 , in the pursuit of understanding the star formation history of dwarf galaxies in the local universe and their place in the downsizing of star formation .",
