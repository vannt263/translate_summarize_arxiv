    "the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) is the most massive baryonic component in galaxy clusters , comprising @xmath012% of the total cluster mass , or @xmath010@xmath910@xmath10 m@xmath2 in rich clusters .",
    "the bulk of the icm is very low density ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) , and will require @xmath010 gyr to cool via thermal bremsstrahlung radiation . in the centers of clusters , however , this situation is reversed .",
    "the icm in the inner @xmath0100 kpc can reach high enough density that the cooling time is short relative to the age of the cluster ( @xmath13 gyr ) .",
    "this ought to result in a runaway cooling flow , fueling a massive , 1001000 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 starburst in the central cluster galaxy ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , despite the fact that roughly a third of all galaxy clusters have short central cooling times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to the ongoing star formation rate in central cluster galaxies , one can quantify what fraction of the cooling icm is able to condense and form stars .",
    "these studies typically find that only @xmath01% of the predicted cooling flow is ultimately converted into stars .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that this inefficient cooling can be divided into two contributing parts : cooling from high ( @xmath010@xmath15 k ) to low ( @xmath010 k ) temperature at @xmath010% efficiency , and an additionally @xmath010% efficiency of converting cold gas into stars .",
    "the former term is generally referred to as the `` cooling flow problem '' , and suggests that some form of feedback is preventing gas from cooling out of the hot phase .",
    "the most popular solution to the cooling flow problem is that `` radio - mode '' feedback from the central supermassive blackhole is offsetting radiative losses in the icm ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "further , recent studies of newly - discovered high-@xmath16 clusters in the south pole telescope 2500 deg@xmath17 survey @xcite suggest that this energy balance between icm cooling and agn feedback has been in place since @xmath18 @xcite",

    ", we argued that the only feasible way to bring such a vast supply of cold gas into the center of a rich cluster was via a runaway cooling flow .",
    "however , @xcite showed that radio - mode feedback is operating at a level that ought to offset radiative cooling in this system , although whether this energy has had time to couple to the icm is uncertain .",
    "the fact that the central agn is simultaneously providing strong radiative ( quasar - mode ) and mechanical ( radio - mode ) feedback suggests that it may be in the process of transitioning from a qso to a radio galaxy , and that the starburst is being fueled by gas that cooled before the first radio outburst .",

    "we overplot a series of best - fitting model spectra , comparing different reddening models @xcite and star formation histories .",

    "it is worth noting that the age is only weakly constrained in this region of the spectrum , due to the relatively short wavelength range .",
    "there is little difference in stellar populations and reddening between the northern and southern cos apertures .",
    "this may be due to the considerable overlap between the two regions ( see figure [ fig : cos_regions ] ) or may indicate a uniformity in the starburst . with only two options for metallicity when synthesizing high - resolution spectra at far - uv ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  2.2 ) , we can only weakly constrain the metallicity from this spectrum .",
    "we note that the solar metallicity spectrum provides a significantly worse fit than the spectrum for the @xmath48 population , with the former having significantly ( factor of @xmath05 ) stronger absorption lines which are not present in the observed spectrum .",
    "we stress that , despite the extremely high star formation rate inferred by the uv spectrum , the young population constitutes @xmath411% of the total stellar mass in the central galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with our picture of bcg formation , since this mode of star formation _ must _ be suppressed to prevent central cluster galaxies from growing too massive ( and luminous ) by @xmath49 .    in summary ,",
    "the combined uv - through - optical spectrum of the central galaxy in the phoenix cluster reveals a highly - reddened ( e(b - v ) @xmath0 0.5 ) , young stellar population , consistent with being recently quenched ( @xmath505 myr ) .

    "while the model is , overall , a good match to the data , there are several features present in the data that are not reflected in the models . in the case of the emission at @xmath01050",

    "the placement of these apertures was chosen so that the spectra could be added ( i.e. , the combined throughput never sums to @xmath61 ; see figure [ fig : cos_regions ] ) , meaning that the total ovi luminosity in the central @xmath015kpc of the phoenix cluster is l@xmath55 erg s@xmath4 . for comparison ,",

    "the observed , extinction - corrected line ratios are consistent with having origins in either dust - free agn @xcite or fast radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "we subtract the contribution to these emission lines from star - forming regions , converting the uv - derived star formation rates to emission line fluxes for a range of stellar photoionization models @xcite . the larger uncertainties on the sf - corrected line ratios reflects our uncertainty in the ionization field of these young stars .",
    "these revised line ratios , with stellar photoionization contributions removed ( figure [ fig : ovi ] , blue points ) , remain consistent with an agn or shock - heated origin .",
    "we remove the agn contribution to the emission lines by extracting the optical spectrum from our gmos ifu data in a 1@xmath28 wide aperture centered on the nucleus .",
    "assuming a range of agn photoionization models @xcite to estimate the ovi emission , based on the observed heii@xmath304686 flux , we are able to infer the amount of , for example , ovi emission coming from the nucleus , without having any actual spatial information from the cos spectroscopy .",
    "the inferred contribution to each line from the agn was subtracted , allowing us to estimate agn - free line ratios in the optical and uv .. the resulting line ratios , which have both stellar and agn photoionization removed ( figure [ fig : ovi ] , green points ) , remain consistent with radiative shocks with @xmath59 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the large error bars , resulting from our combined uncertainty in the stellar and agn photoionization fields , are consistent with the full range of magnetic fields tested by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier work @xcite , in which we argued that the warm ( 10@xmath51k ) gas is predominantly heated by radiative shocks , based on multiple optical line ratio diagnostics ( e.g. , [ oiii]/h@xmath29 , [ oii]/[oiii ] , as well as the gas kinematics . in this earlier work , we showed evidence for a high - velocity , highly - ionized plume of gas extending north from the central agn , along the same direction as our two cos pointings .",
    "such highly - ionized , high - velocity signatures are typically not observed in low-@xmath16 clusters , where the warm gas tends to be only weakly ionized .",
    "figure [ fig : ovi ] demonstrates that , even after removing ionization contributions from young stars and agn , the observed high - ionization line ratios are inconsistent with a pure cooling flow model from cloudy @xcite .",
    "however , we demonstrate that including a 5000 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 cooling flow to the model ( representing only @xmath010% of the observed ovi flux , purple point in figure [ fig : ovi ] ) does not significantly change the observed line ratios , which remain consistent with shocks .",
    "further , we expect additional ionization from both particle heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the former likely contributes at a low level throughout the cluster core . given that the radio flux of the agn is fairly typical of bcgs with significantly less star formation",
    ", we expect particle heating to be negligible compared to other ionization sources in the extreme environment of the phoenix cluster . on the other hand , mixing of hot and cold gas",
    "is likely contributing significantly given the abundance of multiphase gas in this system .",
    "mixing of the hot and cold gas ought to result in an intermediate - temperature phase , which would likely be near @xmath010@xmath60k @xcite .",
    "this would lead to substantial ovi emission for relatively low rates of net cooling from the hot to cold phase .",

    "* ) , mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "more likely , the extinction in the extended filaments is lower than in the inner few kpc . assuming a much more conservative extinction in the aperture correction ( @xmath106 , representing the minimum value measured in @xcite ) yields sfr  =  570 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 . assuming that the correct answer lies somewhere between these extrema",

    "for example , an instantaneous burst of average age 2 myr , which is preferred by the uv - only spectral fit ( figure [ fig : ovi ] ) , would have a time - averaged star formation rate of 1200 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 _ before aperture correction_. on the other hand , if the star formation has been proceeding at a constant level for the past 15 myr , the time - averaged rate can be as low as @xmath0300 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 ( figure [ fig : fullspec ] ) .",
    "this uncertainty could be reduced by obtaining deep , rest - frame near - uv ( @xmath02000 ) spectroscopy . at these wavelengths ,",

    "the uv emission is highly asymmetric ( figure [ fig : megacam ] ) , indicative of a vigorous , turbulent starburst .",
    "however , at large radii the young stars are oriented along thin , linear filaments , akin to systems like perseus @xcite and abell  1795 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrate that the fuel for the observed star formation must originate within the cluster core .",
    "a scenario in which cold gas is brought into the core via infalling gas - rich galaxies and/or groups is unfeasible for this system , given the extreme icm density ( efficient ram - pressure stripping ) and amount of gas needed to fuel such a starburst ( i.e. , multiple gas - rich compact groups ) .",
    "a popular scenario for the origin of star - forming filaments in nearby cool core clusters involves cool gas being drawn from the cluster core in the wake of buoyant radio - blown bubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figures [ fig : megacam ] and [ fig : residual ] demonstrate that the most extended filaments surround , rather than trail , the most significant set of cavities , inconsistent with the uplift scenario .",
    "indeed , the fact that the star - forming filaments extend beyond these cavities in radius suggests that the cool gas was present before the current epoch of feedback .",
    "however , this does not rule out a scenario in which these filaments were uplifted by a previous episode of feedback , with the bubbles responsible for this action having risen to such radii that they are undetectable",
    ".    it may be that no additional mechanism is necessary to produce the extended , star - forming filaments observed in the core of the phoenix cluster .",
    "recent work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite has shown that local thermodynamic instabilities can develop when the ratio of the cooling time to the free - fall time ( @xmath94 ) is less than 10 . in figure",
    "[ fig : tctff ] , we show this ratio as a function of radius for the phoenix cluster , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the computation of @xmath97 . the cooling time is shorter than 10 times the free - fall time over an unprecedented @xmath060 kpc in radius , suggesting that the star - forming filaments may be fueled by local thermodynamic instabilities in the hot icm , which rapidly condense and then `` rain '' down onto the central cluster galaxy @xcite",
    "further , we expect a map of @xmath94 to be asymmetric , since the gravitational potential is roughly spherically symmetric ( in the core ) , while the gas density is not ( see figure [ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "for example , the spiral - shaped overdensity at @xmath050kpc north of the cluster center will likely have @xmath108 , since the azimuthally - averaged value at that radius is @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus , despite the fact that @xmath111 at @xmath112kpc , there are likely overdense regions in the icm with @xmath108 out to the full extent of the star - forming filaments at @xmath113kpc .    if the star - forming filaments did indeed condense out of the hot icm , there ought to be evidence of cooling in the x - ray spectrum . using the latest _",

    "the first term on the right corresponds to the cooling rate in the absence of any additional heating , while the second term on the right is the correction factor to account for the fact that infalling gas will simultaneously be heated gravitationally .",

    "however , by computing the total cavity power assuming they are real , we place a rough upper limit on the total amount of power in previous outbursts . following the same procedures as above",
    ", we estimate a total cavity power of @xmath136 erg s@xmath4 , or anywhere from a third to 100% of the cooling luminosity .",
    "this range overlaps well with the energy in the ongoing outburst at small radii , suggesting that the mechanical power has been roughly constant over the past two epochs of feedback , spanning @xmath0100 myr . in summary , there is strong evidence for ongoing mechanical - mode feedback in the inner @xmath020 kpc of the phoenix cluster , and weaker , but still convincing , evidence for a prior epoch of feedback roughly 100 myr ago .",
    "these episodes of feedback have highly uncertain energetics ( factor of a few in p@xmath137 ) , but are consistent with the energy required to offset cooling losses .",
    "this scenario is further supported by the fact that the cooling time at @xmath138kpc is longer than the apparent duty cycle of this agn ( @xmath0100 myr ) , suggesting that perfect balance in a given feedback epoch is not necessary at larger radii .",
    "future studies with significantly deeper x - ray and low - frequency radio data will provide a more clear picture of both the duty cycle and energetics in these radio - mode outbursts .",
    "phoenix is unusual in that its high radio mechanical power is accompanied by a bright quasar with x - ray photon luminosity @xmath139 .",
    "this high x - ray flux is relatively stable , with no significant fluctuations observed between the initial chandra and suzaku observations in 2011 and 2012 , and the most recent chandra observations in 2014 .",
    "radio agn with comparable radiative and mechanical powers are uncommon , as are radiatively - efficient agn at the centers of clusters @xcite .",
    "the eddington luminosity for a @xmath140 black hole is @xmath141 erg s@xmath4 , which would place phoenix at a few percent of the eddington rate , close to the expected transition between radio - mechanical agn and quasars @xcite .",
    "standard agn theory posits that the form of power output depends on the specific accretion rate : objects accreting above a few percent of the eddington rate are dominated by radiation and those below are dominated by mechanical outflows .",
    "that phoenix exhibits the characteristics of both a quasar and a radio galaxy , suggesting that it may be in transition between the two states .    based on their discovery of neutral iron emission from the agn using the suzaku observatory , @xcite have argued that the bcg is a type 2 quasar with a high absorption column density .",
    "assuming a bolometric correction factor of 130 @xcite , they argue that the total unabsorbed agn power would be @xmath142 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this figure implies a black hole accretion rate exceeding @xmath143 , which would be the highest rate known in a brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "such a high bolometric correction implies a high infrared luminosity , where most of the radiation from the buried agn should be escaping .",
    "the total infrared luminosity emerging from the quasar and surrounding star formation is only @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "this luminosity is comparable to both the mechanical and x - ray energy fluxes , but lies two orders of magnitude below the bolometric luminosity quoted by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the bolometric correction to the nuclear x - ray luminosity is at most a factor of a few to ten , consistent with the lower values reported by @xcite for high - luminosity agn .",
    "therefore the mechanical power of phoenix s radio jets is comparable to the radiation emerging from the quasar , suggesting that it may currently be undergoing a transition from `` quasar  mode '' to `` radio  mode '' .",
    "the 610 mhz image of the core of the phoenix cluster previously revealed the presence of a central compact radio source , associated with the bcg , and diffuse @xmath145  kpc emission surrounding this central source @xcite .",
    "the diffuse emission is classified as a radio mini - halo and , at a redshift of @xmath146 , is the most distant known . the integrated flux density of @xmath147  mjy for the mini - halo results in a 1.4  ghz radio power of @xmath148 w  hz@xmath4 , scaling with a spectral index of @xmath149 .    considering the lifetimes of the radio emitting electrons and the large extent of the mini - halos , a form of in - situ cosmic ray ( cr ) production or re - acceleration is required .",
    "an explanation for the presence of cr electrons is that turbulence in the cluster core re - accelerates a population of relativistic fossil electrons @xcite .",
    "these electrons could , for example , have originated from the central radio source , associated with the bcg .",
    "it has been suggested that gas sloshing , induced by a minor merger event , could generate the required turbulence .",
    "this is supported by the observed spatial correlation between the morphologies of some mini - halos and spiral - like sloshing patterns in the x - ray gas of other nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide further support for this model .",
    "the x - ray residual maps shown in figure [ fig : residual ] do show some spiral structure reminiscent of sloshing excited by a minor merger , suggesting that phoenix cluster may have undergone a minor merger recently .",
    "the lack of any large - scale asymmetry ( rightmost panel of figure [ fig : residual ] ) implies that any merging system must be relatively small compared to the main cluster .    due to the mass of this system",
    ", the necessary turbulent velocities to accelerate crs can be achieved by the relatively - smooth accretion of low - mass systems , rather than a single , recent event . since the phoenix cluster is amongst the most massive clusters known ( @xmath150 m@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and turbulent velocities scale with halo mass ( based on structure formation theory ) , it is feasible that the phoenix cluster maintains a high enough turbulent velocity in its core to continuously re - accelerate a population of relativistic electrons .",
    "alternative models , which can also explain the presence of radio mini halos , invoke secondary electrons that are produced by collisions between cr protons and thermal protons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these secondary models are only successful in explaining a small range of observed properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as one of the most massive cool core clusters known , the phoenix cluster can be considered , in many ways , a `` scaled - up '' , but otherwise normal , system . for example , the @xmath0100kpc extent of the star - forming filaments is extreme , being the most extended cool filaments observed in a cool core cluster to date .",
    "however , we showed in @xcite that multiphase gas is typically observed to a maximum radius of @xmath151 in nearby clusters , where @xmath151 is defined at the radius within which the cooling time is less than 3 gyr . for perseus and abell  1795 , this radius corresponds to @xmath060kpc , while for the phoenix cluster we measure @xmath152kpc .",
    "thus , while extreme , the extent of these star - forming filaments are scaling as expected with the overall mass of the cluster , and do not challenge our understanding of cool core clusters .",
    "the same can be said for the extreme cooling luminosity , central gas pressure , and radio luminosity .    the extreme star formation rate in the core of the phoenix cluster ( @xmath0600 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 ) may be pointing to something unique about this cluster .",
    "this starburst accounts for @xmath020% of the classically - predicted cooling flow , suggesting that cooling may be proceeding very efficiently in this system . for comparison",
    ", @xcite found , for a sample of nearby clusters with star - forming bcgs , a typical ratio of the star formation rate to the cooling rate of 1.8@xmath153%  roughly an order of magnitude lower than what we observe in the phoenix cluster .",
    "however , when the most extreme end of this population is considered ",
    "clusters harboring starburst bcgs such as abell  1835 ( sfr  @xmath0  200 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* )  this ratio jumps to @xmath154% .",
    "that is , it appears that there is a tail of extreme clusters that are cooling rapidly , fueling efficient star formation in the central galaxy . in this context",
    ", the phoenix cluster represents the most extreme of ( but not distinct from ) a subset of rapidly - cooling clusters    the cooling properties of the icm are also , as one may expect , quite different in the phoenix cluster than in a typical galaxy cluster . in figure 3 of @xcite ,",
    "the normalized density and cooling time profiles of @xmath0100 massive galaxy clusters at @xmath155 are shown .",
    "of these systems , only the phoenix cluster violates the minimum floor of @xmath98 , and it does so by a substantial margin .",
    "the violation of this boundary is thought to initiate strong agn feedback via condensation or precipitation of the cooling icm .",
    "this is also reflected in figure [ fig : profiles ] , where we show that the icm entropy profile in the phoenix cluster is consistent with the baseline entropy profile , which represents the expectation in the absence of any feedback @xcite , _ at all radii_. when considering all 165 known galaxy groups and clusters with existing _",
    "chandra _ data and temperatures in the range 4 kev @xmath41 t@xmath156 @xmath41 15 kev , @xcite did not find a single cluster with an entropy profile as steep as phoenix over the range @xmath157 kpc . indeed , the only other cluster known with such a steep entropy profile is h1821 + 643 @xcite , which also harbors a cluster - centric qso , presumably fueled by a rapidly - cooling core .",
    "the consistency between the entropy profile in the phoenix cluster and the baseline entropy profile suggests that the icm has been allowed to cool in this unique system with relatively little resistance .    perhaps providing the link between these two characteristic aspects of the phoenix cluster ",
    "the extreme starburst and rapidly - cooling icm  is the central agn , which is unusual in its own way .",
    "this central agn is one of only a few known cluster - centric qsos @xcite and appears to be transitioning from quasar - mode to radio - mode .",
    "the current radio outburst appears to have recently begun , with the radio - blown bubbles appearing small in size and confined to the innermost regions of the cluster , while a previous outburst may have occurred as recently as @xmath0100myr ago .",
    "this agn appears to be heavily influencing the local environment , highly ionizing the cool gas in the central @xmath010kpc , driving an ionized outflow north of the central galaxy @xcite , and inflating bubbles in the dense icm which may be re - directing the extended , star - forming filaments ( see figure [ fig : jets ] ) .",
    "understanding the extreme nature of this agn , specifically why it appears to have had transitioned from mechanical - mode to radiative - mode , and now back to mechanical - mode , will likely provide the key to understanding the other oddities in the core of the phoenix cluster .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed , multi - wavelength study of the core of the phoenix galaxy cluster ( spt - clj2344 - 4243 ) .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on a combination of new and archival data at radio ( gmrt ) , optical ( hst - wfc3 , magellan megacam ) , ultraviolet ( hst - wfc3 , hst - cos ) , and x - ray ( _ chandra_-acis - i ) wavelengths .",
    "the primary results of this latest study are summarized as follows :    * complex , star - forming filaments are observed in the rest - frame ultraviolet to extend up to @xmath0100kpc from the central cluster galaxy in multiple directions .",
    "these newly - detected filaments extend a factor of @xmath02 times further than the previously - reported maximum extent of star formation . *",
    "modeling the combined uv - optical ( rest - frame 9006000 ) spectrum of the central cluster galaxy reveals a massive ( @xmath44 m@xmath2 ) , young ( @xmath04.5 myr ) stellar population .",
    "based on these data , we estimate a time - averaged , extinction- and aperture - corrected star formation rate of @xmath3 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 . we note that this estimate can vary by a factor of @xmath02 in either direction by changing our assumptions on the star formation history . *",
    "the best - fitting dust model is significantly `` grayer '' than that measured for the milky way and smc / lmc , consistent with observations for nearby starburst galaxies and distant quasars .",
    "the data show no evidence of the 2175  bump , suggesting that there may be a process either destroying or preventing the formation of small grains and those contributing to this bump ( i.e. , pahs ) .",
    "* we detect significant ovi@xmath51032,1038 emission ( l@xmath158 erg s@xmath4 ) in the inner @xmath015 kpc of the cluster core .",

    "we are unable to put constraints on what fraction of this emission may originate from the cooling icm  the data are consistent with both a complete lack of cooling and a massive ( i.e. , 5000 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 ) cooling flow .",
