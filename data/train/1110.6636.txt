    "our construction employs an elegant probabilistic approach based on randomization and conditioning ( see @xcite ) , first used in the polygonal context by sinai @xcite .",
    "the idea is to represent a given measure @xmath18 on @xmath15 as the conditional distribution , @xmath40 , induced by a suitable `` global '' probability measure @xmath41 defined on the space @xmath42 of convex lattice polygonal lines with a free right endpoint . in turn",

    "it is interesting to try and relax the @xmath5-smoothness condition on @xmath8 ( e.g. , by permitting `` change - points '' or corners ) , as well as to allow for degeneration of the curvature ( e.g. , through possible flat segments ) .",
