    "understanding the statistical properties of quantum systems out of equilibrium is one of the main challenges of modern physics .",
    "apart from numerous applications to a diversity of physical problems ( e.g. inflationary expansion of the early universe in cosmology , large - scale quantum computation ) and experiments ( e.g. heavy - ion collision , dynamics of cold atomic gases ) , this branch of physics is inherently related to a fundamental long - standing question : how and under what conditions a quantum system , that is initially prepared in an out - of - equilibrium state and evolves under the quantum mechanical law of unitary evolution , tends for long times to equilibrium @xcite ? is this equilibrium always thermal or of some generalized type @xcite ?",
    "experimental progress over the last decade @xcite followed by advances in the theoretical treatment of out - of - equilibrium quantum physics have opened a unique opportunity to tackle such questions . a special protocol that has concentrated a great part of attention for its relatively simple theoretical treatment and experimental feasibility is the _ quantum quench _ protocol @xcite : an instantaneous change of parameters of the hamiltonian of a system",
    "so that it initially lies in the ground state of the pre - quench hamiltonian while it evolves under the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "an important quantity in the study of quantum quench problems is the following one @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the initial state ( or boundary - in - time state ) , i.e. the ground state of the pre - quench hamiltonian , and @xmath2 the post - quench hamiltonian . for imaginary values @xmath3",
    "this function gives the overlap between the initial and the evolved state after time @xmath4 , the loschmidt amplitude , whose norm square is the _ loschmidt echo _",
    "@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "( in the more general case when @xmath1 is not an eigenstate of the pre - quench hamiltonian , the loschmidt echo is modified by a nontrivial evolution under the prequench hamiltonian @xmath6 , see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "this overlap is essentially the characteristic function of the probability density function @xmath7 of the statistics of the work done @xcite ( differing in a constant factor and shift ) .",
    "knowledge of this distribution amounts to knowledge of all probabilities to excite each post - quench energy level , which is all that is needed in order to calculate the long time averages of observables @xcite or their asymptotic values provided they become stationary @xcite . on the other hand , for positive real values of @xmath8",
    "the above quantity is the partition function of a system defined in a 2d strip of width @xmath9 with boundary conditions @xmath1 on both edges .",
    "thus @xmath10 provides a direct manifestation of a useful mapping between the out - of - equilibrium problem of a quantum quench and a well - studied boundary problem @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 in the complex plane is also an interesting subject of study . in lattice models in particular ,",
    "since @xmath10 is an entire function @xcite , its zeroes in the complex @xmath11-plane determine completely the non - analytic part of the associated free energy .",
    "it has been argued that , in the thermodynamic limit a concentration of zeroes around particular points of the imaginary axis ( real @xmath4-axis ) is associated to non - analytic behaviour in the free energy @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated for a quench across the critical point of the ising model , exploiting its mapping to free fermions ( where however the continuum limit tames the singularities of the free energy corresponding to zeroes of @xmath10 into square root branch points ) .",
    "it was proposed that such zeroes ( or branch points ) of @xmath10 play a role analogous to that of fisher zeroes in ordinary phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this non - analytic behaviour was later shown to be robust under the inclusion of non - integrable interactions , irrelevant or relevant in the rg sense , using the tdmrg numerical method @xcite .",
    "however more recently it was also shown that such non - analyticities are caused more generally by a crossing of eigenvalues in the spectrum of the transfer matrix @xcite and that they may not appear even if a critical line is crossed , thus indicating that the presence of zeros in @xmath10 and non - analyticities in the free energy and @xmath5 are not a characteristic feature of dynamical phase transitions @xcite .",
    "further progress in the analytical calculation of the above quantity for integrable spin chains was made using algebraic bethe ansatz techniques @xcite .",
    "if the analytical continuation of the complex variable @xmath12 from real to imaginary values is not prevented by the presence of zeroes ( that correspond to logarithmic singularities of the associated free energy ) , it is possible to calculate the work probability distribution @xmath7 from the boundary partition function @xmath13 . in this way",
    "universal behaviour associated with the critical casimir effect in the boundary formulation of the problem can be connected to universal properties of @xmath7 in the limit of massless post - quench hamiltonian , in particular properties of its lowest excitation threshold @xcite .",
    "study of the return amplitude in a finite system described by a conformal field theory reveals that in a certain time - to - system - size limit the reduced density matrix of the system approaches exponentially a thermal one , as well as the complicate structure of quantum revivals @xcite . the loschmidt echo has been calculated in the context of quantum quench and related problems in several other studies relative to spin chains , conformal field theories and other models that are essentially equivalent to non - interacting ones @xcite .",
    "so far no analytical study of the loschmidt echo has been done in an integrable quantum field theory ( iqft ) that can not be mapped into a non - interacting model ( apart from a proposed generalization of a calculation based on conformal field theory for the case of a local quantum quench problem @xcite ) . for global quantum quenches in such a general relativistic iqft and under certain conditions for the initial state , the function ( [ eq : z ] ) , viewed as the partition function of the strip boundary problem for real values of @xmath11 , can be calculated using the so - called _ boundary thermodynamic bethe ansatz _ ( btba ) @xcite . in the btba",
    "the boundaries are represented by states that preserve the integrability of the bulk of the system ( _ boundary integrable states _ ) and were shown to be of the following form @xcite @xmath14 the operators @xmath15 are the zamolodchikov - faddeev operators @xcite , strings of which acting on the vacuum create asymptotic scattering states , that constitute an eigenstate basis of the iqft . @xmath16 in the boundary integrable problem satisfies the so - called boundary cross - unitarity condition and is related to the reflection matrix ( @xmath17 is the rapidity variable , a convenient reparametrization of the momentum of single particle excitations , i.e. its energy s and momentum s being @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ) . for simplicity ,",
    "in the above equation and in all that follows we restrict ourselves to an iqft with a single particle species , as is the sinh - gordon ( shg ) model .",
    "the dirichlet state , a typical example of a boundary integrable state , defined as the state annihilated by the physical field @xmath20 and thus having vanishing field fluctuations , is of the above form with @xmath21 known exactly @xcite .",
    "the initial state of a _",
    "global _ quantum quench in iqfts is given , in certain important special cases , by this same boundary integrable form ( [ eq : bs ] ) .",
    "such cases are those of free theories and when the pre - quench mass tends to infinity . in the latter case",
    "the field fluctuations vanish and therefore the initial state is exactly the dirichlet state .",
    "this state requires careful ultraviolet regularization , since otherwise it leads to divergent physical observables .",
    "it has been recently argued @xcite that for a quantum quench in the shg model from a large but finite pre - quench mass @xmath22 and zero interaction to an arbitrary post - quench mass @xmath23 and arbitrary interaction , one obtains as initial state a modified dirichlet state that is approximately given by the same form ( [ eq : bs ] ) with amplitude @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amplitude that corresponds to a free bosonic quantum quench of the mass from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "this state is free from ultraviolet divergences and consistent with the requirements of a quantum quench . in complete generality",
    ", the situation seems to be more complicated @xcite : the extensivity of the conserved charges in the initial state introduces certain constraints for the amplitudes of excitations contained in it , at least in the limit of large number of particles @xcite , but those constraints are more general than the precise special form ( [ eq : bs ] ) .    considering all the above , in this work",
    "we propose a derivation of the loschmidt amplitude and thus the work statistics relative to a global quench in iqfts by means of the boundary tba solved on the imaginary axis . since the tba is an integral equation representation , we a priori expect that the analytical continuation would give the correct loschmidt echo . indeed , a similar approach has been successfully used before for the calculation of excitation energies in iqft @xcite .",
    "we perform this calculation in the sinh - gordon model , arguably the simplest relativistic iqft with non - trivial s - matrix .",
    "while this serves as a demonstration of the approach , it also allows us to see the effects of turning on the interaction on the thermodynamics of a quench in a quantum field theory . on the other hand ,",
    "it can be considered as the first step for the application to a quench in the sine - gordon model , which can be obtained by analytical continuation of the interaction coupling parameter of the shg model from real to imaginary values .",
    "a quantum quench in the sine - gordon model can actually be experimentally implemented , for example in systems of split 1d bose - einstein quasi - condensates that interact through a longitudinal potential barrier that behaves like a josephson junction @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we expose general properties about the statistics of the work done when performing a quantum quench , then we introduce the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , followed by a discussion of its continuation to imaginary temperatures , both from a theoretical and a numerical point of view .",
    "then we discuss results for the work statistics of integrable field theories , in particular the sinh - gordon model .",
    "we find that the first peak in the probability density function is not affected by the interaction and we give it in an analytic form .",
    "then we discuss global mass quenches from large but finite initial masses in the free bosonic , free fermionic and the sinh - gordon models .",
    "we determine that while the moments of the distribution , in particular the mean , are only changed slightly by turning on the interaction , the details are modified .",
    "this can be seen on the first edge , which develops a fermionic , positive edge singularity exponent opposed to the bosonic negative one .",
    "the last section is reserved for conclusions .",
    "consider a closed quantum system in a @xmath26-dimensional box of edge length @xmath27 ( @xmath26 is the number of spatial dimensions ) with periodic boundary conditions , undergoing a quench from the hamiltonian @xmath28 to @xmath2 .",
    "before the quench the system lies in the ground state @xmath1 of the hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "one can treat the quench as a thermodynamic transformation and ask how much work is done on the system .",
    "the performed work can be defined by referring to two projective energy measurements before and after the quench .",
    "since the quench protocol is abrupt , the work becomes stochastic with a probability distribution    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is any eigenstate of the post - quench hamiltonian , @xmath31 the corresponding energy eigenvalue and @xmath32 the energy of the pre - quench ground state @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath33 of this probability distribution is the inverse fourier transform @xmath34 which , using the previous definition , can be readily shown to be equal to @xmath35 the last expression is the loschmidt amplitude : the overlap between the state @xmath36 , which is the evolution of the initial state under the post - quench hamiltonian @xmath2 for time @xmath4 , and the state @xmath37 , which is its evolution under the pre - quench hamiltonian @xmath6 for the same time @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "performing the wick rotation @xmath38 , the resulting quantity is the moment generating function of the distribution and can be identified with the partition function of the system confined in a slab of width @xmath9 with both boundary states equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the latter has been extensively studied in the context of the _ casimir effect . _",
    "the corresponding free energy per volume @xmath40 can be split into the following three parts according to their behaviour for large @xmath9 @xmath41 in the above @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the bulk and surface contributions , while the remaining part @xmath44 decays for large @xmath9 . in the original quantum quench problem , @xmath42 corresponds to the difference in the ground state energies of the post- and pre - quench hamiltonians per volume , @xmath45 , while @xmath43 is related to the squared norm of the so - called _ fidelity _ @xmath46 between these states , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the post - quench ground state . in terms of the probability density function @xmath7",
    "@xmath49 corresponds to a shift and @xmath50 to the normalization and the shape is determined only by @xmath51 .",
    "the cumulants ( equivalent to the moments ) of the probability distribution @xmath7 are given by the logarithmic derivatives of its characteristic function at @xmath52 @xmath53 note that since @xmath54 is extensive , all cumulants @xmath55 are extensive too , which means in particular , that increasing the system size @xmath27 , the relative variance of @xmath7 tends to zero and in the thermodynamic limit becomes a narrow bell - shaped distribution characterized by its mean value and variance .",
    "note however , that in finite volume a more careful analysis predicts exponential corrections to the cumulants .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of @xmath7 can be easily inferred by considering the energy absorption that corresponds to any of the possible transitions from the initial state to eigenstates of the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "the lowest energy absorption corresponds to the transition from the initial state to the post - quench ground state @xmath48 , which therefore appears in @xmath7 as a dirac @xmath56-function peak at the value @xmath57 with amplitude given by the squared norm of the fidelity @xmath46 between these states . from now on we will measure the work from the position of this lowest dirac @xmath56-function peak , i.e. we will subtract the ground state energy difference from the work @xmath58 .",
    "the next lowest energy absorption corresponds to the transition to the lowest post - quench excitation that is allowed . for a massive post - quench hamiltonian , like the sinh - gordon hamiltonian",
    ", the lowest excitations are separated from the ground state by the energy gap @xmath23 i.e. the mass of the lightest quasi - particle excitations .",
    "however since the initial state is translationally invariant and due to the conservation of the momentum , only transitions to excitations with zero total momentum are allowed .",
    "furthermore , assuming that both the pre- and post - quench hamiltonians are invariant under parity transformations of the fields ( i.e. if the hamiltonian @xmath59 is invariant under @xmath60 where @xmath20 are the fields describing the system ) , as in our case , there can only be even - particle excitations in the initial state .",
    "this means in particular that there can not be any single - particle excitation of momentum zero which would correspond to a @xmath56-peak at @xmath58 equal to the particle mass .",
    "it is possible however to have bound - state excitations consisting of even number of particles with zero total momentum , if the post - quench hamiltonian contains such excitations ( like in the sine - gordon model ) .",
    "apart from such possible @xmath56-peaks , the lowest allowed transitions correspond to the creation of two quasi - particles with opposite momenta @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "this means that @xmath7 exhibits a lowest threshold at @xmath63 above which there is a continuous absorption spectrum corresponding to the continuous variable @xmath64 .",
    "the shape of the absorption spectrum above this lowest threshold depends on the excitation amplitudes , the dimensionality @xmath26 and the nature of the excitations ( i.e. the statistics , bosonic or fermionic , and the parameters of their dispersion relation ) . at the vicinity of",
    "the threshold @xmath7 exhibits an edge - singularity , typically appearing as a sharp peak .",
    "provided that the analytic continuation @xmath65 of the results for the casimir free energy is valid , it can be shown that the edge - singularity exhibits universal behaviour controlled by the large @xmath9 behaviour of @xmath44 . in more detail , just above the threshold the distribution exhibits a power - law form with an exponent that depends only on the dimensionality and the particle statistics . in 1d",
    "the edge exponent is @xmath66 for bosons and @xmath67 for fermions ( for details , see below )",
    ". if the excitations are of bosonic nature , there are additional edge - singularity peaks at positions determined by the thresholds for multi - particle excitation transitions which overlap with the previous continuous spectrum and with each other .",
    "obviously there exist peaks for all different types of particle excitations present in the model , each with its own mass .",
    "furthermore , any bound - state excitations would manifest themselves as dirac @xmath56-function peaks at values equal to their mass ( and any integer multiple of the latter , if they are of bosonic nature ) , while peaks at positions that are odd multiples of the masses are also possible , if odd multi - particle excitations are not excluded by parity symmetry .    in the present case of the sinh - gordon model and for the particular choice of initial state ,",
    "the above general observations apply as follows",
    ". there are no bound - state excitations , therefore there are no @xmath56-function peaks , other than the ground state one at @xmath68 .",
    "there is only one type of excitations with mass @xmath23 , therefore we expect an edge - singularity above the lowest threshold at @xmath69 . furthermore , the initial state consists of pairs of opposite momentum quasiparticle excitations exclusively , so that there will be additional peaks only at integer multiples of @xmath63 . due to the exponential form , the multi - particle excitations are all controlled by the single - pair excitation amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "having the definition of the pdf of the work ( [ defpw ] ) and the known form of the pre - quench state in terms of post - quench states , i.e. a squeezed state ( at least in the important special cases considered in this paper ) it seems that obtaining @xmath7 is just a matter of performing a sum .",
    "however , we would like to argue , that it is in fact far from trivial to perform this sum .",
    "in fact , in the thermodynamic limit the levels become continuous , the sum turns into an integral and a nontrivial density of states needs to be taken into account in ( [ defpw ] ) . furthermore , the squeezed state ( [ eq : bs ] ) , is not given on a convenient , ordered basis of states , @xmath70 relative to the post - quench hamiltonian , therefore to use the definition in addition to the density of states ( for all number of particles @xmath71 possible ) we would also need to solve a combinatorial problem to recast the squeezed state in terms of a post - quench basis .    a convenient way to do these tasks",
    "is to perform a fourier transform and calculate the equivalent loschmidt amplitude @xmath33 ( [ losch ] ) by analytically continuing the boundary partition function in the slab geometry .",
    "this can be obtained in the presence of bulk integrability , i.e. integrable post - quench dynamics , from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we briefly introduce the thermodynamic bethe ansatz in the presence of boundaries and discuss possible issues when performing analytic continuations .",
    "consider a @xmath72 dimensional quantum system on a finite cylinder of length @xmath9 and circumference @xmath27 with given boundary conditions @xmath1 at the two ends .",
    "there are two equivalent quantization schemes : in the first , time is chosen to run along the axis of the cylinder ( so - called r - channel ) , while in the second the time direction is perpendicular to the axis ( l - channel ) .",
    "the partition function in the two quantization schemes reads @xmath73 in effect a projection of the bulk partition function on the state @xmath74 .",
    "while in the r - channel the boundary conditions can be taken into account as initial and final states , in the l - channel one must impose instead a finite system size hamiltonian @xmath75 that depends on the boundary conditions applied at the edges .",
    "taking now the thermodynamic limit , @xmath76 , we get @xmath77 where the first line does not simplify but the second has terms exponentially more and more suppressed , and it is enough to look at only the first one , i.e. @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ground state energy in finite volume of a system with boundaries described efficiently by the boundary states @xmath80 .",
    "we remark that the tba ( presented below ) yields only the contribution @xmath81 ( the bulk term is absent by construction , it can however be extracted through comparison with conformal perturbation theory @xcite and the surface term corresponds to the normalization of the boundary state @xmath74 ) , however this is enough since @xmath81 is the only part that determines the nontrivial shape of @xmath7 .",
    "now we focus on integrable models , in which the two - body s - matrix , in our case ( theories with a single particle species ) a single function @xmath82 , characterizes all the dynamics , i.e. the higher - body scattering events factorize into two - body collisions .",
    "this can be formalized in terms of the faddeev - zamolodchikov algebra , @xmath83 where the operators @xmath84 generate the space of asymptotic states as @xmath85    in finite volume @xmath27 , one is subject to the quantization conditions , which can be written in a tractable form , the bethe - yang equation @xmath86 but only for integrable models .",
    "( note , that in small volume there are exponentially small corrections to these energy levels .",
    "the sign corresponds to periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions , connected to the statistics of particles . in an integrable theory",
    "the statistics is reflected in the sign @xmath87 . the only known theory with the bosonic sign @xmath88",
    "is that of free bosons . )",
    "this relation can then be rewritten in terms of particle densities and used as a constraint when performing a saddle point evaluation of the partition function expressed as a functional integral over different configurations . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath76 ) the saddle point dominates the functional integral and",
    "the resulting expressions for thermodynamic quantities constitute the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) .",
    "the saddle - point solution is equivalent to a superposition state composed of both few- and many - particle excitations , which can explicitly be seen through a multi - particle expansion .",
    "having in mind that the few - particle terms will play an important role in the followings it is important to consider these few - particle terms . at first sight",
    "it might seem that the tba will break down in a limit where such terms dominate or equivalently that these contributions should not be precise in the tba framework since for the tba to work the particle density per unit volume must be intensive in @xmath27 , on the other hand to a few - particle state a nonintensive particle density per unit volume corresponds . however , we consider a linear combination of extensively many two- , four- , etc .",
    "particle states instead of isolated ones and therefore the corresponding particle density is intensive also in the few - particle limit .    in the presence of boundaries , integrability ( in the l - channel )",
    "is only preserved if the boundary states respect the very special form of @xcite @xmath89 and @xmath16 is the analytic continuation of the reflection factor @xmath9 that describes scattering on the boundary ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "such boundary integrable states can be incorporated into the tba construction as a rapidity dependent chemical potential to yield for example@xcite @xmath91 with @xmath92\\ ] ] and the pseudoenergy @xmath93 solves the nonlinear integral equation @xmath94 where the logarithmic derivative of the scattering matrix was introduced as @xmath95    as will become clear later , in terms of the corresponding boundary problem , i.e. in the l - channel , the initial / boundary states relative to quenches can not preserve integrability ( which would correspond to very restrictive choices of the amplitude @xmath16 , in particular one that means an infinite energy initial state ) , therefore it is essential to note , that @xmath16 is in fact arbitrary as long as one s interest is in the quantity ( [ zdef ] ) and is content to remain in the r - channel rather than the boundary problem .",
    "this is clear from the derivation of the btba which proceeds in the r - channel and then integrability plays a role only in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the btba equation is a non - linear integral equation . on a purely mathematical basis",
    ", it can be shown that for any @xmath96 it possesses a unique real solution @xmath93 that is an analytic function of @xmath17 in the neighborhood of the real @xmath17 axis @xcite .",
    "for @xmath96 the unique solution can be found using the iterative method which converges uniformly as a function of @xmath9 , thus ensuring that the solution is analytic also in @xmath9 in sufficiently small neighborhoods of any real positive value of @xmath9 .    here",
    ", we want to analytically continue the btba into the complex @xmath9 plane to obtain the loschmidt amplitude @xmath97 instead of the partition function .",
    "for complex values of @xmath9 non - analyticities may occur .",
    "using the fact that iqft can be derived from perturbations of cfts and in addition the truncation of the hilbert space of these cfts , it can be argued that the possible non - analyticities of @xmath93 as a function of @xmath9 are in general square - root branch points that appear whenever two eigenvalues of the perturbing operator become degenerate @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "such square - root branch points accumulate around the critical point of the theory as explained in the yang - lee theory of phase transitions .",
    "it is interesting to note , that in the corresponding lattice model the branch points become singularities , giving rise to the fisher zeroes of the partition function @xcite .",
    "we point out that in the presence of boundaries the analytic structure can and does change .",
    "in fact , for the sinh - gordon model there are branch points on the imaginary axis for the tba without boundaries , while when we used the boundary state relative to a quench , we no longer found any branch points .",
    "one can begin to understand this in terms of the corresponding fisher zeroes of the lattice partition function : if one does a quench originating from one phase and arriving in a different phase , one may expect ( not always ) a dynamical phase transition in the time evolution , which is governed by the fisher zeroes @xcite . with a reversed logic , when quenching inside the same phase , as in our case , a dynamical phase transition is not expected ( although in some cases they were observed also without crossing a phase transition line , see @xcite ) , thus neither are fisher zeroes , i.e. branch points .    moving on now to the solution of the btba for complex @xmath9 ,",
    "it is a priori obvious , that in the left half - plane the btba equations can not be solved by means of the usual iterative scheme with the free solution as initial step , since in this case the integral equation would diverge .",
    "therefore existence and uniqueness of the solution is not guaranteed , at least not based on the standard iterative approach .",
    "luckily , this is not needed for our purposes , since the analytical continuation is all done inside the right half - plane . in the latter",
    "the iterative method is valid and one only needs to track possible singularities that may block the analytical continuation . viewing these singularities in the complex rapidity plane , where they appear as zeroes of the logarithm in ( [ tbaeq ] )",
    ", we see that when we vary the value of @xmath9 , one such singularity may approach the contour of integration from one side .",
    "even when it crosses the real rapidity axis though , we can deform the integration contour off the axis on the opposite side , where the integrand is analytic , therefore keeping the solution of the tba equation analytic in @xmath9 .",
    "if we insist to write the tba equation with the integration contour along the real axis , we have to modify it by including the contribution of the logarithmic singularity , in order to stay analytically connected to the real-@xmath9 tba equation . if however , while varying @xmath9 , a pair of such singularities approach the integration contour at the same point from both sides , such a contour deformation is not possible and the tba equation exhibits non - analytic behaviour for that value of @xmath9 .",
    "these are called _ pinching singularities_. this is a problem familiar from the study of the excited state energies @xcite .    in the simple case of the sinh - gordon with the quench boundary state , such subtleties do not arise . approaching the imaginary axis is still nontrivial : even if the boundaries regularize an iteration approach , one is still left with oscillating integrals instead of exponentially decaying ones .",
    "this feature poses a serious numerical bottleneck , especially for @xmath9 with larger absolute values .",
    "we are also interested in the work statistics , therefore knowledge of the loschmidt amplitude on a large domain is necessary . in section 3.2",
    "we propose an evaluation technique that we applied successfully to solve the btba for @xmath98 , with @xmath4 s being effectively arbitrarily large .      in this section",
    "we discuss the role of the initial state in the calculation of the work statistics in quantum quenches .",
    "we first summarize results for free models , bosonic and fermionic , that will help us better understand the results for integrable models in general and the shg model in particular .      for mass quenches the boundary state in both the bosonic and fermionic theories",
    "can be written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the free boson / fermion creation operator in momentum representation .",
    "for free bosons the amplitude @xmath101 is @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 . substituting @xmath105 ,",
    "the above equation can be written in terms of rapidities as @xmath106 where @xmath107    for free ( majorana ) fermions instead the boundary state amplitude is @xcite @xmath108 or in terms of rapidities @xmath109      the sinh - gordon model is a simple model from the tba point of view , however it contains genuine , strong interaction and is an interesting testing ground for our ideas .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath110 and describes an integrable field theory with a single particle species with physical mass @xmath111 and scattering amplitude and phase shift @xmath112 the fourier transform of the phase shift reads @xmath113 notice the weak / strong coupling duality @xmath114 .    in general",
    ", determining the initial state @xmath1 after a quantum quench in an iqft , i.e. calculating the amplitudes of excitations ( in the post - quench basis ) contained in the initial state , is a difficult problem .",
    "one has to extract this information from the defining property of the initial state that it is annihilated by the annihilation operators of the pre - quench hamiltonian , whose expression in terms of the post - quench creation and annihilation operators is generally unknown @xcite .",
    "however , in the case where the pre - quench hamiltonian is non - interacting ( @xmath115 ) the above requirement reduces to the simpler condition @xmath116\\right ) |\\omega \\rangle = 0\\ ] ] valid for all momenta @xmath19 . in the latter ,",
    "@xmath117 is the pre - quench mass and @xmath118 the fourier transform of the physical field @xmath119 .",
    "if we formally expand @xmath1 as @xmath120 ( up to an overall normalization factor ) then , applying suitable test states on the left of the former equation , we can derive equations that must be satisfied by the amplitudes @xmath121 of the excitations in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these equations are integral equations consisting of an infinite series that involves amplitudes @xmath121 of all orders , as well as the form - factors of the field @xmath20 .",
    "obviously it is impossible to solve these equations , unless we have some good ansatz for the solution .",
    "based on general properties of the pre - quench ground state ( translational and parity invariance ) it can be shown that all odd amplitudes @xmath122 vanish . furthermore , as mentioned in the introduction , we know that the solution in the limit of infinite @xmath117 is the dirichlet state defined by @xmath123 whose exact form is already known by other means @xcite : it is of the exponential form ( [ eq : bs ] ) with amplitude @xmath124 given by @xmath125 it can be verified that the amplitudes of @xmath126 satisfy the integral equations as expected .",
    "however this state exhibits ultraviolet divergences in the calculation of observables , due to the non - decaying behaviour of @xmath124 for large @xmath17 or , equivalently , due to the fact that the natural ultraviolet bound of excitations is of the order of @xmath117 which is considered to be infinite .",
    "in particular , in the calculation of the loschmidt echo and work statistics using the btba , a sufficiently fast ultraviolet decay of the amplitude @xmath127 is necessary in order to ensure the convergence of the integrals in ( [ fcint ] ) and ( [ tbaeq ] ) . indeed , while for real @xmath128 the integrand decays exponentially even for @xmath127 that does not decay for large @xmath17 , for imaginary @xmath128 instead it exhibits oscillatory behaviour unless @xmath127 decays itself . assuming a large but not infinite @xmath117 modifies the form of the state and , from the integral equations , it can be shown @xcite that to a good approximation the modified state can be described by the same exponential form ( [ eq : bs ] ) with a new amplitude @xmath129 note that the large @xmath17 behaviour of this amplitude is the same as that of @xmath130 i.e. it decays as @xmath131 .",
    "this solves the problem of ultraviolet divergences of the dirichlet state . in our btba calculations",
    "we will use exactly this choice of initial state .",
    "the above arguments can be generalized to other relativistic iqfts .",
    "before we proceed to the numerical analysis of the shg model , we report a general exact result for the shape of the lowest peak of the work probability distribution @xmath7 in any iqft in large @xmath27 : the part @xmath132 ( for a single particle theory ) is entirely determined by @xmath16 since in this region there can only be two particles in the system with opposite momenta , which never scatter off each other thus the form of the scattering matrix is irrelevant .      in this section using the btba we obtain @xmath7 analytically in the region @xmath132 and provide a systematic method to calculate it in terms of multiple integrals for @xmath133 .",
    "this calculation relies on that ultimately we only need the fourier transform of the solution of the btba with respect to @xmath4 , and that each step of an iterative solution provides exactly the fourier components in sequential frequency windows .",
    "this property is true because of the gap in the excitation spectrum . solving the btba equation exactly in energy space ,",
    "i.e. obtaining the fourier transform of the solution with respect to @xmath4 , is also interesting on its own right , since incidentally we can provide a systematic method to obtain the solution of a nonlinear integral equation exactly , although in terms of multiple integrals .",
    "first of all it is useful to introduce the difference between the pseudoenergy @xmath134 for the interacting and non - interacting scenarios , i.e. we define @xmath135 this function satisfies the nonlinear integral equation @xmath136 equivalent to ( [ tbaeq ] ) .",

    "moreover , the form factor approach is capable to provide the amplitudes @xmath168 also in the more general case of arbitrary initial model parameters .",
    "we begin with the definition , which takes the form @xmath169 we used , that states with energy smaller than @xmath170 are all two particle states and that the initial state @xmath74 is translationally invariant . in finite volume",

    "we stress here , that the formula ( [ edge ] ) remains valid for arbitrary initial mass and interaction strength , in which case @xmath177 does not follow the regularized dirichlet form , but it needs to be calculated by solving the integral equations of @xcite",
    ". we also note , that in general , ( [ edge ] ) should remain valid as long as the particle picture is valid , i.e. even in the presence of a small integrability breaking perturbation as long as the energy spectrum has the same structure , e.g. production of new particles is not induced at these energies .",
    "to proceed further in the pdf , to higher values of @xmath133 , such a simple analysis is no longer possible .",
    "already for the four - particle states there is a much more prominent influence of the scattering matrix on the values of allowed rapidities in the bethe - yang approach and inferring the density of states is not trivial anymore .",
    "therefore , it is indeed necessary to find an alternative approach ( here the btba ) for the work pdf other than direct evaluation of the definition .        for free bosonic theories the statistics of the work done was already studied earlier @xcite .",

    "we show the work statistics for a mass quench in the free theories .",
    "the two distributions are very different : the tails of the distributions are decaying differently and for low energies the bosonic function contains a characteristic sequence of edge singularities , which are absent from the fermionic distribution .",
    "the differences can be understood by studying the initial states .",
    "the corresponding @xmath127 functions are markedly different from each other : the fermionic is zero at @xmath165 , that signals the fermionic nature of the scattering ( multiple particle excitations of equal rapidities are suppressed ) .",

    "we solve this by simply iterating the equation ( as @xmath188 with @xmath140 ) until we arrive sufficiently near to a fixed point in the function space ( the target was to reach 1 % change in @xmath189 norm ) .",
    "the iterative step is performed in fourier space , whereas for the determination of @xmath190 from @xmath191 we have to go back to the @xmath17 variable .",
    "therefore we discretized the problem and performed the fourier transforms by fft .",
    "the precision of the solution can be checked by substituting the resulting @xmath192 function to the original integral equation .",
    "precision is controlled by the cut - offs in @xmath17 and @xmath193 spaces beyond all the functions are supposed to be zero , the discretization steps , and the tolerance target .    from the analysis of section 3.1.1 we expect that for increasing @xmath4 less and less iterations are neccessary to obtain a precise solution of the btba equation , which property we in fact observed when doing the actual numerics . this is because the large @xmath4 behavior of @xmath194 is controlled by the small @xmath195 behavior of the fourier transform with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath196 , which we shown to become exact after already one iteration ( or for larger @xmath195 ( relevant for smaller @xmath4 ) a few , but finite iterations ) .",
    "there is a problematic point that was already mentioned : while for real temperatures the btba and the integral for the ground state energy involve exponentially suppressed kernels , for imaginary temperatures these turn into oscillating ones , which however still get suppressed for large @xmath17 . when iterating the btba in fourier space this does not pose a serious problem , however when calculating the ground state energy from the pseudoenergy it does .",
    "this probably stems from that in the former case we have to fourier transform a highly oscillatory function , while in the latter we rather have to laplace transform it . to overcome this difficulty we analyzed the btba and determined the following , previously seemingly unnoticed property .",
    "consider a function @xmath197 and its fourier transform @xmath198 , so that @xmath199 it is well known , but also easy to see from the definition that exponential decay , i.e. @xmath200 as @xmath201 corresponds to a pole of @xmath198 located at @xmath202 with residue @xmath203 , which is also the closest one to the real line .",

    "we now focus on the specific case of a quantum quench in the shg from zero initial coupling and large initial mass to any coupling and mass , as introduced before .",
    "we perform numerical calculations of the loschmidt echo as a function of time , the partition function @xmath10 given by ( [ eq : z ] ) in the complex @xmath11-plane , the pdf of the work done and the dependence of the mean work on the post - quench coupling and mass .    to get the loschmidt echo @xmath216 we continue analytically the partition function @xmath10 from the positive real line @xmath217 , where the tba equation is known to yield a unique result , to the imaginary line @xmath218 . as we discussed before it is possible that for some lines in the @xmath11-plane @xmath10 develops a branch cut corresponding to logarithmic divergences in the function @xmath219 . for some values of @xmath220 we performed a numerical continuation of @xmath221 to @xmath222 following lines @xmath223 along @xmath224 $ ] and looked at every step for the zeroes of the argument of the logarithmic term @xmath219 .",
    "we did not find any zeroes crossing the integration contour .",
    "therefore we elected to simply solve the original btba equation iteratively with initial condition @xmath225 for a dense grid in the upper right quarter of the complex plane . since the resulting function ( depicted in fig .",

    "the work statistics was only obtained for non - interacting models or those that can be mapped to such . in the present paper one of our main objectives was to see the effect of turning on a genuine interaction .    using the equivalence of the work probability density function ( pdf ) and its characteristic function , the loschmidt amplitude , we proposed to find the pdf from the analytic continuation of the partition function provided by the boundary thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( btba ) .",
    "our motivation was given partially by recent advances on the expansion of the initial quench state on the post - quench basis , in particular that for certain kinds of quenches the initial state is similar to boundary integrable states , for which the btba can be used .",
    "we proposed that because of integrability in these models the initial part of the pdf is universal , in the sense that it only depends on the initial state and not the particulars of the scattering .",
    "that is , if two different systems are prepared in the same initial state ( in terms of asymptotic particles ) , the initial part of the pdf of the required work is the same . for the case of one particle species we gave a formula that gives the first peak of the pdf analytically .",

    "so much so , that the continuation of the btba from the real positive half - axis ( where it provides the partition function in finite volume and temperature ) to the imaginary axis ( providing the loschmidt amplitude ) is only nontrivial because of numerical obstacles .",
