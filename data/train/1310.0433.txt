    "solutions of the einstein - maxwell system of equations for static spherically symmetric interior spacetimes are important in describing charged compact objects in relativistic astrophysics where the gravitational field is strong , as in the case of neutron stars . the detailed analyses of @xcite and @xcite show that the presence of electromagnetic field affects the values of redships , luminosities and maximum mass of compact objects .",
