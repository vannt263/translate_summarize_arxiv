    "pinning and sliding of lattice systems , which can form periodic structures in the absence of perturbations , are subjects of considerable interest . in the presence of pinning disorder and driving forces , they can exhibit a wide variety of interesting equilibrium and non - equilibrium behavior with partially ordered and glassy structures .",
    "important examples in two dimensions include vortex lattices in superconducting films @xcite , atomic layers adsorbed between sliding surfaces @xcite or on oscillating substrates @xcite , and colloidal crystals on a rough substrate @xcite .",
    "although in three dimensions a topological ordered phase , the bragg glass @xcite , with quasi - long range positional order is possible in the weak disorder regime , the two - dimensional limit is qualitatively different due to the proliferation of thermally and disorder - induced dislocations even in the weak - disorder regime .",
    "analytical and numerical studies for the equilibrium behavior @xcite have shown that , in two dimensions , positional and orientational order are both destroyed by weak pinning disorder and topological defects at any nonzero temperature leading to a liquid - like phase in the thermodynamic limit . in the absence of thermal fluctuations ( zero temperature ) an amorphous glass is expected @xcite . for the system under a driving force moving at high velocities ,",
    "it has been shown analytically that some components of the disorder remain static in the co - moving reference frame , leading to a moving glass phase @xcite . in three - dimensional systems ,",
    "such state can show topological order as a moving bragg glass @xcite . in two dimensions",
    ", however , this phase corresponds to a moving smectic glass , which retains quasi long - range order in the direction transverse to the driving force but only exponential correlations in the parallel direction @xcite .    in modeling such lattice systems , both for static and dynamic properties ,",
    "it is essential to include the periodicity of the lattice and allow for topological defects ( dislocations and disclinations ) .",
    "these topological defects are not contained in pure elastic models that have completely different properties , specially in two dimensions .",
    "a phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) model was introduced recently @xcite that allows for both elastic deformations and topological defects within an effective continuous description of the lattice system while still retaining information on short length scales . by extending the pfc model to take into account the effect of an external periodic pinning potential @xcite ,",
    "a two - dimensional version of the model has been used to describe commensurate - incommensurate transitions in the presence of thermal fluctuations @xcite and the driven response @xcite including inertial effects @xcite . however , in order to study the statics and dynamics of the disordered system , quenched pinning disorder needs to be included in the pfc modeling .    in this work ,",
    "we study the structural correlations and nonlinear response to a driving force of a two - dimensional pfc model with random pinning .",
    "the model provides an effective continuous description of lattice systems in presence of disordered external pinning centers , allowing for both elastic and plastic deformations .",
    "we show that in the presence of disorder , the phase - field crystal assume an amorphous glassy ground state , with only short - ranged positional and orientational correlations even in the limit of weak disorder . under increasing driving force",
    ", the pinned amorphous - glass phase evolves into a moving plastic - flow phase and then finally a smectic phase .",
    "the transverse response of the moving smectic phase shows a vanishing transverse critical force for increasing system sizes .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the pfc model with an external pinning potential @xcite can be written in a dimensionless form as @xmath0 \\psi + \\frac{\\psi^4}{4 } + v(\\vec x ) \\psi ( \\vec x ) \\ } , \\label{pfcp}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a continuous field at position @xmath2 in two dimensions and @xmath3 is the pinning potential .",
    "the field @xmath1 is conserved and its average value , @xmath4 , together with @xmath5 are the relevant parameters in the model .    in the absence of the pinning potential , @xmath6 , the energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ pfcp ] ) can be minimized by a configuration of the field @xmath1 forming a hexagonal pattern of peaks with wave vector of magnitude @xmath7 , when the values of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath4 are chosen appropriately .",
    "this structure of peaks can be regarded as the ground state of a lattice system with perfect crystalline order , where the phase field @xmath1 represents the deviation of the particle number density @xmath9 from a reference value @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ pfcp ] ) can then be used to describe both elastic as well plastic properties of the lattice system @xcite , including the effects of thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "an external driving force @xmath12 in the lattice system , can be represented by an additional contribution to the effective hamiltonian as @xmath13 which will lead to nonequilibrium behavior .",
    "the effects of the driving force have been recently investigated in some detail @xcite , in absence of disorder .",
    "inertial effects of the lattice system can also be described within the pfc model , by including an additional kinetic energy contribution to the effective hamiltonian as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the momentum density field .",
    "the dynamical equations describing the time evolution of the lattice system in presence of thermal fluctuations and the external force can be written as @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the spatially uniform external force and @xmath18 is a thermal noise satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation relation corresponding to a temperature @xmath19 and damping coefficient @xmath20 .    in the present work ,",
    "we only consider the limit of very large @xmath20 , when inertial effects are negligible , leading to the overdamped dynamical equations @xmath21 the above coupled equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 can also be combined into a single equation for @xmath22 , giving @xmath24    the generalization of the pfc model with an external periodic pinning potential studied previously @xcite to the case of a quenched random pinning potential considered here is straightforward .",
    "such a model is relevant for studying diverse systems such as , adsorbate layers with quenched impurities or on substrates with disorder , and vortex lattice in superconductors in the presence of pinning centers . to this end",
    "we model the quenched potential in the simplest way by defining at every spatial location @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a @xmath27-correlated distribution @xmath28 and @xmath29 is an amplitude characterizing the strength of the disorder . since , there is no characteristic length scale in such pinning potential , it is particularly suitable for the investigation of finite - size effects using small system sizes as done in this work . in this",
    "_ dense _ pinning model , the separation between pinning centers can be much smaller than the distance between the density peaks in the phase - field crystal .",
    "this corresponds to a physical system where the length scale of the varying pinning potential is smaller than the average lattice spacing of the system . such a scenario could be realized _",
    "e.g. _ in the case of colloidal particles confined near a rough glass plate @xcite .    for the numerical calculations ,",
    "the phase field @xmath1 is defined on a space grid @xmath30 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulations in presence of thermal fluctuations and the driving force were performed using eq .",
    "( [ coveq ] ) , using euler s method with the laplacians and gradients evaluated by finite differences . in the absence of external force and thermal fluctuations , the equation of motion ( [ soveq ] ) was used in most simulations , and solved using a semi - implicit algorithm .",

    "the term @xmath39 is the fourier transform of the nonlinear part @xmath40 .",
    "to investigate the influence of disorder on the structural properties of the phase - field crystal , we study the behavior of the static correlation functions from calculations of the structure factor @xmath41 and orientational susceptibility @xmath42 , which measure translational order and orientational order @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 can be obtained from the positions @xmath43 of the peaks in the phase - field pattern as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of peaks , while @xmath42 can be obtained from the local orientational order parameter @xmath46 as @xmath47 the orientational order parameter @xmath46 is a measure of the six - fold orientational symmetry of the crystalline order and is defined as @xmath48 where the summation is taken over the @xmath49 nearest neighbors of the peak at position @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the angle of the bond @xmath52 with an arbitrary axis .",
    "the disorder averaged @xmath53 and @xmath42 are obtained by averaging over different realizations of the disorder configurations @xmath3 .    in the absence of disorder , solutions of the pfc model form a periodic hexagonal array of peaks in the ground state with wavector @xmath54 , which has both long range positional and six - fold orientational order .",
    "positional order can be characterized by the scaling of the structure factor @xmath55 with system size @xmath56 , which behaves as @xmath57 for a perfectly ordered state .",
    "disorder can destroy positional long range order and lead to quasi long - range or short - range positional order , which corresponds to correlations that decay with distance @xmath8 as a power law @xmath58 or exponentially @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "for these distinct types of correlations the corresponding structure factor is expected to behave as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for large system sizes .",
    "we find it convenient to define an _ effective exponent _",
    "@xmath62 to characterized the positional order in different regimes , from a power law fit of the normalized structure peak as @xmath63 with this definition , since @xmath64 , @xmath65 indicates long range order , @xmath66 quasi long - range order and @xmath67 short - range order .",
    "an analogous effective exponent @xmath68 characterizing the orientational correlations , can be defined from the finite - size dependence of the orientational susceptibility @xmath42 as @xmath69",
    "in this section , we present our numerical results for the static behavior and the driven response of the phase - field crystal at zero temperature ( without thermal noise ) , obtained in the absence and presence of the external force , respectively . the dynamical equations , eqs .",
    "( [ coveq ] ) and ( [ soveq ] ) , were integrated numerically on a uniform square grid with @xmath70 .",
    "the total system size @xmath71 accommodates approximately @xmath72 density maxima .",
    "the pfc parameters are set to @xmath73 , where the ground state of the model is a perfectly ordered hexagonal phase in the absence of disorder , and @xmath74 . for the case without external force and thermal fluctuations we used a rectangular box of size",
    "@xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in order to check the size effect we performed calculations for several values of @xmath78 from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "we first search for the the lowest - energy state of the phase - field crystal in the absence of the external driving force . for this purpose",
    ", we have used the simulated annealing method to avoid trapping in higher energy metastable states .",
    "first , simulations of equilibrium states at some initial temperature corresponding to finite noise terms in the dynamical equation ( eq .",
    "( [ coveq ] ) ) are performed using arbitrary initial configurations .",
    "then the initial temperature is slowly decreased to zero leading to a final configuration with a minimum energy .",
    "this annealing procedure is repeated for different initial configurations and the zero - temperature configuration with the lowest energy is identified as the ground state .",
    "[ sfanneal ] shows the behavior of the structure factor peak and orientational susceptibility as function of the system size obtained by simulated annealing , in the weak disorder regime , @xmath81 . the effective exponent for both positional and orientational correlations obtained from a power law fit of the size dependence in fig .",
    "[ sfanneal ] is consistent with two , indicating that correlations are short ranged .",
    "larger disorder strength gives the same result .",
    "this behavior suggests that the ground state of the phase - field crystal in presence of pinning disorder is an amorphous glass .",
    "this is expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "in fact , analytical studies by renormalization - group methods @xcite and computer simulations @xcite indicate that , in two dimensions , quasi long - range positional and orientational order are destroyed by weak disorder or thermal fluctuations , leading to a liquid - like phase in the thermodynamic limit . in the absence of thermal fluctuations ( zero temperature ) an amorphous - glass state is expected @xcite . the length scale for the crossover to such state increases with decreasing disorder strength .",
    "long - range order in presence of weak disorder has been found at low temperatures in some other models @xcite , which however describe structural ( internal ) disorder @xcite rather than external pinning disorder as considered here . on the other hand , in some molecular - dynamics simulations of particle models of colloidal crystals on a disordered substrate @xcite ,",
    "quasi long - range order was observed at low temperatures in a weak disorder regime , although no detailed finite - size analysis was carried out .",
    "quasi long - range order has also been observed in experiments on colloidal crystals on a rough substrate @xcite .",
    "however , the apparent positional and orientational order in such cases can also be explained as a finite - size effect due to a large but finite crossover length scale , which increases with decreasing disorder strength @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is the effect of slow dynamics , which requires a much longer time scale to observe the true equilibrium state , leading to partially - ordered metastable states . in sec .",
    "ivc , we examine similar states for the pfc model , which were obtained using the dynamical equations in absence of thermal annealing .      to obtain the driven response of solutions of the phase - field crystal model ,",
    "we determine the steady state velocity of the peaks under a constant external force as described by eq .",
    "( [ coveq ] ) .",
    "the velocity is measured by tracking the position of the peaks @xmath82 in the phase field @xmath1 during the simulation @xcite . from the velocities of the peak positions @xmath83 ,",
    "the steady state drift velocity is obtained as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of peaks and @xmath86 denotes time average .",
    "the disorder averaged drift velocity is then obtained by averaging over different realizations of the disorder configurations .",
    "the calculations were done without thermal noise ( zero temperature ) .",
    "the initial state at @xmath87 is obtained from simulated annealing as described in sec .",
    "the velocity response of the phase - field crystal to the applied driving force is shown fig .",
    "[ vxf ] for strong disorder @xmath88 .",
    "the velocity response is nonlinear , with different behavior at low and large driving forces , due to the effects of pinning .",
    "this property is observed in different lattice systems with quenched disorder @xcite . at sufficiently low drive ,",
    "the drift velocity is negligibly small and the phase - field crystal remains pinned in the amorphous glassy phase . as the force increases beyond a critical value , @xmath89 , corresponding to a depinning transition , the phase - field crystal moves with increasing steady - state velocity but with different patterns at low and high velocities as can be seen from the corresponding configurations in fig .",
    "[ patf02f08 ] . at low velocities above the critical force @xmath90 ,",
    "the pattern of the phase field has a liquid - like structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ patf02f08]a for @xmath91 .",
    "the trajectories of the local maxima in the phase field @xmath1 correspond to a plastic flow due to pinned and unpinned regions . for this moving state ,",
    "the corresponding structure factor ( fig .",
    "[ sff02f08 ] ) , averaged over time and disorder , shows small and broad peaks . for larger values of the driving force above a characteristic value @xmath92 ,",
    "there is a dynamical reordering transition to a moving partially ordered phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ patf02f08]c for @xmath93 .",
    "the trajectories of the local maxima form well defined static channels parallel to the driving force .",
    "the structure factor now become larger and sharper as shown in fig .",
    "[ sff02f08 ] .",
    "rough estimates of critical values @xmath90 and @xmath92 obtained for different disorder strengths were used to construct the qualitative dynamical phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and applied force shown in fig .",
    "[ phadiag ] .",
    "the nature of the moving phase at high velocities is particularly interesting . since the pinning potential acts as a time oscillating perturbation in the co - moving reference frame",
    ", one would expects that the disorder effects on the initial hexagonal structure should decrease with increasing velocity .",
    "however , it has been shown that some components of the disorder remain static @xcite , leading to a moving glass phase . in two dimensions ,",
    "such a phase corresponds to a moving transverse glass characterized by a smectic - like structure , which retains quasi long - range order in the direction perpendicular to the applied force but only exponential correlations in the direction parallel to the force @xcite .",
    "this moving smectic state has been observed in many different driven systems with disorder @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the present driven pfc model , the pattern for the large driving force in fig .",
    "[ patf02f08]d also shows a smectic - like structure . to verify this behavior more quantitatively ,",
    "we have studied the finite - size dependence of the structure factor peaks ( fig .",
    "[ sff02f08 ] ) in the transverse and longitudinal directions for the sliding state at @xmath93 .",
    "the results shown in a log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ sff08 ] are consistent with a smectic phase in the thermodynamic limit , where ordering only occurs in one spatial direction .",
    "the height of the peaks in the transverse direction decreases slowly with system size as a power law @xmath94 with @xmath95 , consistent with quasi long - range order , while in the longitudinal direction it decreases much faster with @xmath96 as expected for short - range order .",
    "this estimate of the critical exponent @xmath97 for the transverse peaks in the driven phase - field crystal is comparable to the result , @xmath98 , obtained for a particle model of driven vortex lattices in disordered superconductors @xcite .",
    "another important property of the moving glass state at large velocities is the existence of barriers to transverse motion .",
    "it was predicted @xcite that this should lead to a transverse critical force at zero temperature for an additional external force applied perpendicular to the initially driving force .",
    "however , it has also been argued @xcite that the transverse response at zero temperature is nonuniversal , and qualitatively different behavior is possible for different physical systems .",
    "the former scenario of transverse depinning has already been observed for driven vortex lattices @xcite . to find out which scenario is realized in the present version of the pfc model",
    ", we have studied the velocity response in the transverse direction @xmath99 at a large longitudinal force @xmath100 for different realizations of the disorder configurations .",
    "we find that the transverse depinning force is very sensitive to the disorder configurations and seems to vanish in some cases as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ trans ] , where the transverse velocity response is shown for different realizations of the disorder configuration for a system size @xmath101 .",
    "to investigate if the transverse critical force is still nonzero in the large system limit , we performed calculations for increasing system sizes and the results were averaged over different disorder configurations . fig .",
    "[ avtrans ] shows that the critical value @xmath102 for the onset of transverse depinning decreases with increasing system size and therefore may actually vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although such behavior is possible according to analytical arguments @xcite , it is unclear at the present which distinct feature of the pfc model is responsible for it .",
    "since a transverse critical force has been found for the same model in the case of periodic pinning @xcite , we can only speculate that the presence of disorder allows some defects to be generated even by small transverse forces .",
    "in the previous section iva we have determined the lowest energy state in absence of a driving force ( ground state ) using simulated annealing methods and found that the configuration corresponds to an amorphous glass state , with only short - ranged positional and orientational correlations . in this section",
    ", we will discuss some metastable states .",
    "these are states corresponding to local minima rather than the global minimum for the ground state .",
    "nonetheless , they may still be relevant under suitable experimental conditions .",
    "metastable states were obtained by starting with the perfect hexagonal ground state in the absence of disorder and then allowing the system to evolve according to the dynamical equation for a relatively short period ( @xmath103 ) , for different disorder strengths in the absence of thermal noise .",
    "the disorder strength @xmath29 is incremented in steps of @xmath104 .",
    "[ deta ] shows the behavior of the effective exponents @xmath62 and @xmath68 for positional and orientational correlations of the final static configuration as a function of the disorder strength @xmath29 .",
    "it appears that there are three different thresholds values of @xmath29 : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "below @xmath108 , the _ weak - disorder _",
    "regime , the system has long - range orientational order and quasi - long range translational order . between @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "the system exhibits both quasi - long range orientational and translation order . between @xmath109 and @xmath110 a hexatic",
    "ordering occurs which corresponds to quasi - long range orientational order and short - range translational order .",
    "this phase ordering is analogous to such a phase that occurs in two dimensional crystals induced by thermal flucuations @xcite . finally above @xmath110 , which is beyond the range of @xmath29 investigated",
    ", we expect that only short - range orientational and translational order should remain .",
    "as described in sec .",
    "iva , the lowest - energy state obtained by simulated annealing is an amorphous glass rather than a partially - ordered state observed in such netastable states .",
    "in fact , the inset in fig . [ deta ]",
    "indicates that the phase - field crystal would remain essentially ordered for weak pinning if no simulated annealing was performed .",
    "however , even in this weak disorder regime correlations are actually short ranged if the system is allowed to reach its true ground state , as can be seen from the inset in fig .",
    "[ sfanneal ] .",
    "although the ground state is an amorphous glass , the thresholds @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ deta ] can represent some characteristic values for non - equilibrium behavior .",
    "we have also investigated the metastable states for a different model of disorder . in this _ sparse _ pinning model , the pinning sites are separated by a minimum distance @xmath113 , _",
    "i.e. _ they can not come closer to each other than the particles in the ideal hexagonal ground state of the pfc model with wave vector @xmath54 .",

    "thus , unlike the _ dense _ pinning model discussed above , there are now two relevant parameters , namely @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "metastable states were obtained again starting from the hexagonal state and incrementing @xmath115 in steps of @xmath116 , while the density of pinning sites @xmath114 was fixed to @xmath117 . for this density of the pinning centers the ratio between the pinning centers and",

    "these results are largely in agreement with previous analytical works @xcite .",
    "an additional new feature is that the transverse response of the moving smectic phase shows a vanishing transverse critical force for increasing system sizes .",
