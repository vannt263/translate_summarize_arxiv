    "in a novel dynamical approach the @xmath1 vertices of a graph @xmath0 are mapped onto @xmath1 physical points located initially at equal distances from each other forming a symmetric @xmath1 simplex in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "attractive / repulsive forces are introduced between pairs of points corresponding to connected / disconnected vertices in the original graph @xmath0 .",
    "we then let the system evolve utilizing first order aristotelian dynamics@xcite .",
    "we tune the relative strength of repulsive and attractive forces to be @xmath3 with @xmath4 the average valency i.e. average number of vertices connected to a given vertex so as to have no net average repulsion / attractions .",
    "we found , that as the system evolves various physical clusters of points tend to form .",
    "these physical clusterings reveal clusters ( or imperfect cliques ) in the graph - namely groups of vertices with a larger than average mutual connectivity .",
    "also the matrix of distances @xmath5 between the various points @xmath6 and @xmath7 is characteristic of the graph topology : points corresponding to vertices which are `` close in the graph '' namely have ( relatively ) many , short , paths connecting them will move closer together and conversely , points which are `` far in the graph '' tend to move apart .",
    "the distance matrix and clusters are important graph diagnostics .",
    "in particular the first allows us to solve easily the graph equivalence problem namely to decide if two connectivity matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the same topological graph and if they do to find the relabelling of vertices which makes @xmath10 and @xmath11 identical",
    ".    these results are of considerable practical importance",
    ". still neither of the above problems belongs in the special class `` np complete '' problems .",
    "the latter consists of problems such as the travelling salesmen problem and the satisfiability problem for which a putative solution can be readily checked in polynomial time yet no polynomial solution method is presently known@xcite .",
    "many of these problems can be phrased in terms of graphs as the task of finding some specific graph @xmath12 inside bigger graph @xmath0 .",
    "further , all these problems which superficially seem very different are at a basic level , equally difficult : if a method of solution in polynomial time is found for one such problem then all the problems should be solvable in such time by essentially the same method .",
    "conversely if we can prove that just one npc problem necessarily require , non - polynomial time for its solution , the same holds for all of them .",
    "two of us have recently conjectured@xcite that a new variant of our approach namely of dynamically docking rigid simplexes @xmath13 and @xmath14 representing @xmath12 and @xmath0 can solve the `` g inside g '' problems . here",
    "we wish to present the first concrete application of the original , point translation or single simplex distortion algorithm ( sda ) , to an npc problems namely that of finding the largest perfect clique in @xmath0 .",
    "to most clearly illustrate the essence of the problem we consider the `` students in dorm '' example used in the general description of the clay institute prize offered for resolving @xmath15 problem@xcite .",
    "we have @xmath16 students out of which we need to select @xmath17 which can live together in a dorm , subject to a very long list of mutual exclusions .",
    "this list states that student # 1 can not be together with any one student from a specific set of say 200 other students , student student # 2 can not be together with any one from another partially overlapping set with a comparable number of students etc .",
    "how can we pick up a set of 100 students such that any one is completely compatible with the other 99 , and what is this set ?",
    "clearly this is a particular example of the general satisfiability problem where the conditions imposed are just `` two body '' exclusions .",
    "it is also a particular case of looking for a graph @xmath12 inside @xmath0 where @xmath12 is a perfect clique of vertices each of which is connected to all other members in the clique .",
    "we encode into @xmath0 with @xmath16 vertices the various mutual exclusion constraints by not connecting with edges vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 if student # i and student # j are not compatible , and connecting by edges compatible pairs",
    ". clearly if we find within @xmath0 a clique with @xmath1 vertices it means , by our very construction , that the students to which these vertices correspond are indeed all mutually compatible",
    ". we could construct in judicious manner various smaller consistent subsets , and try piece them together .",
    "often , however a new inconsistency is revealed and we need to pursue other alternatives . while we certainly can do this in far less steps than @xmath20 the difficulty of the problem seems to grow at least exponentially with @xmath1 .    in desperation",
    "we might decide to resort to the following primitive alternative and simply let the 400 students `` fight it out '' . in this all out war each student will try to push away members which are inconsistent with him and pull in those which are .",
    "this collective natural selection of the `` compatible '' - which may well be a prerelevant social phenomena - would hopefully leave us with the desired large group of mutually consistent individuals .",
    "unfortunately the outcome of such a 400 way `` somo '' fight of staying in the ring is strongly biased by the initial arbitrary placement of students in the two dimensional arena@xcite .",
    "thus we could envision a situation where an ideal group of completely compatible dorm candidates is placed in the center of a group of highly unpopular ones and is `` ejected '' together with them . in order to generate the correct large clique we need to completely unbias the starting position and avoid the severe constraints due to our existence in a physical world with limited number of dimensions .",
    "this can be done only if we go to @xmath21 dimensions and place the `` students '' which , in the inverse problem that we are really after , are metaphors for the physical points representing the @xmath22 vertices of the graph , at the vertices of a symmetric @xmath22 simplex .",
    "our search for perfect cliques uses the same physically motivated dynamical algorithm previously developed to identify via the physically bunched points clusters or `` imperfect cliques '' in a graph@xcite .",
    "we found that to adapt this algorithm for the present purpose we need only to enhance the ratio of the repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "originally it was chosen to be : @xmath23 which could be relatively small .",
    "thus for an average valency of @xmath24 in a graph with @xmath25 vertices it is only @xmath26 .",
    "however , in order to meet the criteria of _ perfect _ cliques we clearly have to significantly enhance the strength of the repulsive interactions so as to avoid points which are connected to a fairly large number of the points in the clique but not to all of them from joining in .",
    "thus in the first round of applications we used @xmath27 we first considered a small clique of @xmath28 in a graph with @xmath29 vertices with the connectivity matrix of fig.([fig : clq - c ] ) .",
    "in addition to the clique this matrix consists of six clusters with randomly created internal connections with average valency @xmath31 .",
    "these clusters , in turn , have been randomly interconnected with a large valency @xmath32 . to simulate a real - life situation of networks with unknown structure ( topology ) we randomly permute the rows and columns of the matrix @xmath10 obtaining the reshuffled matrix @xmath33 shown in the fig.([fig : clq - b ] ) .      next we apply our algorithm for clusters reconstruction using equal attractive and repulsive constant forces in @xmath34 dimensional space .",
    "the vertices of the 100-simplex were allowed to move under the influence of the forces on the 98-dimensional hyper - sphere in 99-dimensions . after a number of steps we analyzed the mutual distances between the vertices of the simplex and group neighbors which are close to each other into cliques .",
    "the new cluster - connectivity matrix is shown in fig.([fig : clq ] ) .        to see how the algorithm works for the case of overlapping cliques we considered two examples .",
    "the first example includes two cliques @xmath30 and @xmath35 with a @xmath36 overlap on a `` background '' of a @xmath37 matrix with the same average @xmath32 connectivity as above .",
    "the corresponding connectivity matrixes before reshuffling is shown in fig.([fig : clq2-c ] ) .",
    "the second example involves two of cliques @xmath24 with a large overlap of @xmath39 in fig.([fig : clq3-c ] ) .",
    "our reconstruction yields one clique of @xmath24 and one of @xmath39 fig.([fig : clq3-cl ] ) .",
    "as expected we fully reconstruct the largest cliques .",
    "this is done at the expense of correspondingly reducing the size of the reconstructed part of the overlapping smaller or equal size cliques .",
    "other examples involve a @xmath17 clique in a @xmath16 graph corresponding to the `` students in dorm '' question .",
    "in addition we had an imperfect clique or cluster of @xmath41 with average valency of @xmath31 on a background of @xmath32 ( fig.([fig : clqnp - c ] ) ) .",
    "the successfully reconstructed @xmath25 clique after reshuffling is shown in fig.([fig : clqnp - cl ] ) .",
    "fig.([fig : clqnp3-cl ] ) shows the reconstructed results after reshuffling .",
    "the clique is imperfectly reconstructed . however , increasing @xmath45 from one to two improves the reconstruction as shown in fig.([fig : clqnp3-cl2 ] ) .",
    "the above results are to our mind fairly impressive .",
    "these results show that by mild tuning our original code solves in very short time and for many cases the npc problem of the largest clique .",
    "it may still fall short of solving it in all cases . as a worst case scenario we could envision a vertex ( or several such vertices ) which are connected to all the vertices in the clique save one . to avoid these vertices from joining the clique even in this case , rendering it imperfect ,",
    "we need that the single repulsion due to the missing edge , overcome all the @xmath2 attractions to the rest of the points in the clique .",
    "thus the strict perfect clique worst case scenario demands @xmath46 this wildly differs from the above eq.(refx ) : for a graph @xmath0 with @xmath25 vertices @xmath47 and a clique of size @xmath48 we need a factor hundred enhancement of the ratio @xmath45 from @xmath26 to @xmath24 !",
    "our @xmath49 based intuition would strongly suggest that this stops formation of all cliques , perfect or not , since as any given point tries move towards its `` designated '' clique it may be `` overwhelmed '' by the many repulsive forces which will prevent it from joining the clique .",
    "the configuration with the perfect clique ( and the largest perfect clique in particular ) fully formed i.e having all its vertices collapse at a point is indeed the desired final lower energy state",
    ". however there may be false local minima which trap our system just like in spin glass@xcite and protein folding problem@xcite .",
    "this is indeed most certainly the case for `` low '' dimensionalities .",
    "however with @xmath50 , as is the case here , the above intuition fails .",
    "specifically any one given `` test point '' feels just as many different forces in the directions of the other particles namely @xmath51 as there are independent directions @xmath21 to move in . ideally therefore the test particle should be able to simultaneously respond to all different @xmath51 forces , move in the direction of all the attractors and away from all the repellers and in the process further lower the energy of the system .",
    "we can adopt a local , non - orthogonal , system of coordinates where the @xmath51 axes are aligned along the unit vectors pointing from @xmath52 - the chosen point , to @xmath53 the other @xmath51 points . using our choice of constant forces@xcite we have then a net force @xmath54 which is the sum of the unit vectors along these axes with + and - signs .",
    "since these are @xmath51 linearly independent vectors the sum never vanishes @xmath55 always and no local minimum arises .",
    "there is one `` small '' correction however to the above argument .",
    "it is due to the fact that in our original algorithm we have introduced one further constraint on the motion of the points , namely that at all times on the unit circle @xmath56 .",
    "it seemed necessary in order to avoid running away to infinity of repelling vertices or collapse to the origin of attracting ones .",
    "this does however introduce an extra normal reaction force that could in fact cancel the above sum in eq.([z ] ) , and thus yields local minima .",
    "hence in the final runs we did not impose this constraint .",
    "instead we modified our code to facilitate handling the increasing distances between points at later stages of the evolution .",
    "we found that our program fully reconstructed the maximal clique@xcite .",
    "this happens regardless of the degree of the connectivity of the random background and also of the existence of large and partially overlapping slightly smaller cliques .",
    "thus for the n=100 maximal clique in an n=400 vertex graph ( i.e the students choice for dorm problem ) we added two 80x80 cliques which overlapped our 100x100 clique in two 60x60 patches which , in turn , had a 20x20 overlap and used a background with 70% connectivity fig.([fig : c3in400 ] ) . even under such seemingly unfavorable conditions we reconstructed our clique fig.([fig : cl3in400 ] ) .",
