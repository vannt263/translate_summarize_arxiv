    "the radio - transient sky is one of the least explored frontiers in astronomy .",
    "there have been many searches for transient signals , but few astrophysical sources of radio bursts have been confirmed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite reported the discovery of eleven objects characterised by the recurring although unpredictable emission of single , dispersed radio pulses ( additional objects have been discovered by @xcite and others ) .",
    "the unique dispersion measures identified them as astronomical signals , and the peak flux densities ( ranging from 100mjy to 3.6jy ) made these transients among the brightest radio sources in the universe .",
    "the most natural interpretation of these sources is that they are rotating neutron stars ( nss ) which emit radio bursts sporadically : hence the name rotating radio transients ( rrats ) .",
    "based on their ephemeral nature , the total number of rrats in the galaxy ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) might exceed that of the radio pulsars , thus representing a large fraction of the population of neutron stars with age smaller than @xmath10 yr . that calls for a deep investigation of these objects , aimed at understanding their emission properties , environments , and evolutionary links ( if any ) with other classes of neutron stars .",
    "it has been proposed that rrats could be an extreme manifestation of processes already observed in at least some ordinary pulsars : e.g. , giant pulses @xcite , nulling @xcite , or the fading of the radio signal of an old pulsar while approaching the pair - production death line @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting hypothesis is that rrats may be distant middle - aged ( spin - down ages @xmath11yr ) ordinary pulsars ( such as psr  b0656 + 14 ) , whose emission is only detectable when particularly bright pulses occur @xcite . according to other models",
    ", the rrats do not belong to the population of the rotation - powered pulsars : instead associations with the steadily - emitting magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , transient magnetars @xcite , or thermally - emitting isolated neutron stars ( ins ; @xcite ) were suggested .",
    "even more exotic hypotheses explain the bursting behavior of the rrats with the sporadic effects of an asteroid or radiation belt surrounding the pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observation of the counterpart to a rrat in the x - ray band could be crucial for discriminating between many of the models reported above , since they predict distinct x - ray spectral signatures for the source .",
    "unfortunately , only rrat  j1819@xmath01458  ( with spin period @xmath12s , dipole magnetic field @xmath13 g , characteristic age @xmath14 yr , and spin - down luminosity @xmath15 ; for definitions of these parameters see @xcite ) has been detected at high energies .",
    "it was serendipitously found in _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations of the ( almost certainly unrelated ) supernova remnant g15.9 + 0.2 .",
    "additional long pointed integrations revealed that rrat  j1819@xmath01458  has a thermal spectrum with @xmath16kev and an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity @xmath17 @xcite , which is larger than the spin - down luminosity .",
    "the spectrum differs from that of the magnetars , which are hotter ( @xmath18kev * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it may be similar ( at times ) to that of the transient magnetar xte  j1810@xmath0197 ( @xmath19kev ; @xcite ) . instead , the spectrum of rrat  j1819@xmath01458  is comparable in temperature @xcite and x - ray luminosity to the similarly - aged radio pulsar b0656 + 14 ( which itself is consistent with being a nearby rrat ; see above ) .",
    "it is also similar to the slightly older radio - quiet ins ( @xmath20  kev at ages of @xmath21  myr ; see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the spectrum displays a broad absorption line @xcite resembling the lines detected in many of the ins @xcite .",
    "the case of rrat  j1819@xmath01458  illustrates the potentiality of x - ray observations in unveiling possible connections between rrats and other ns populations .",
    "however , until recently these studies have been significantly limited by the lack of precise positions for most of the sources .",
    "rrat  j1819@xmath01458  was one of the only three rrats whose celestial coordinates had been precisely determined through pulse timing ( e.g. , as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "all the other rrats were only localised to within the primary beam of the parkes telescope : @xmath22arcmin diameter for the observing frequency of 1.4ghz . that prevented follow - up multi - wavelength observations and , in turn , the possibility of constraining the spectrum of the rrats and their primary energy stores .",
    "dedicated timing observations presented in @xcite have more than doubled the sub - sample of the rrats with phase - connected timing solutions and hence high precision rotational and astrometric parameters positional uncertainties have been calculated by requiring the reduced @xmath23 values of the residuals to be equal to one ( see @xcite for more details ) . as a confirmation of the accuracy of this technique",
    ", we note that the position of the x - ray counterpart to rrat  j1819@xmath01458  ( confirmed via the identical periodicity of its x - ray pulsations ) is well within the radio timing error circle @xcite . ] .",
    "two among the rrats with a new timing solution ( j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257 ) are located in the @xmath24 diagram in a region almost devoid of ordinary pulsars ( see section [ sec : obs ] for timing parameters ) but close to the area occupied by the ins , lending support to the hypothesis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that they could be transition objects between ordinary pulsars and ins .",
    "inspecting the @xmath24 diagram ( see e.g. , figure  4 in @xcite ) , j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257  also appear the closest rrats to the location of j1819@xmath01458 , the only rrat detected in x - ray so far ( see above ) . here",
    "we present searches for x - ray emission from these two particularly promising sources , based on targeted and archival _ chandra _ observations . in what follows ,",
    "all luminosities are corrected for interstellar absorption .",
    ".summary of x - ray observations[tab : obs ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + the first two observations were taken in the default faint mode and with a 3.2s frame time .",
    "the remaining observations were taken in the very faint mode , and with a 1.8s frame time to reduce the effect of pileup on the probably unrelated psr  j1846@xmath00258 ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we searched for an x - ray counterpart to rrat  j0847@xmath04316  ( @xmath25s , @xmath26 g , @xmath27myr , and@xmath28 ) with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite , as summarised in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "as the position was originally only known to @xmath29arcmin , we used the @xmath30arcmin@xmath31 imaging array on the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ; @xcite ) .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way using the ciao software package ( version 4.1 ) and the caldb 4.1 calibration files , restricting the energy range to 0.38kev . with the timing position of rrat  j0847@xmath04316  available from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* j2000 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , we were able to localise the source to the acis - i1 detector .",
    "the position is near a gap between ccds of the acis - i detector , but is not in the gap : examination of the exposure map ( which takes into account effective area maps of each detector as well as the dither pattern of _ chandra _  on the sky ) shows an effective area at the position of rrat  j0847@xmath04316  comparable to the average of the acis - i1 ccd .",
    "however , we see no source at the position of rrat  j0847@xmath04316 , and searches using wavdetect did not find any source closer than @xmath34arcmin",
    ". we must go out to a radius of @xmath35arcsec before there are any counts , and those counts appear consistent with the background rate ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we compare this with the radio position uncertainty ( @xmath37arcsec ) , the _ chandra _  aspect uncertainty ( @xmath38arcsec at 90 per cent confidence , as this source is on - axis ; there is no systematic aspect offset listed for this observation ) , and the _ chandra _  point - spread function ( 90 per cent encircled energy radius of @xmath39arcsec at 1.5kev ) . using a generous extraction radius of @xmath40arcsec",
    "there are 2 counts with 0.4 expected from the background ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "given poisson fluctuations @xcite , we can place a 3@xmath3 upper limit of @xmath41 counts coming from rrat  j0847@xmath04316 , or a count - rate limit of @xmath42 . note that for rrat  j1819@xmath01458  about 10 per cent of the x - ray flux is in an extended nebula going out to at least @xmath43arcsec @xcite , but the contribution is small enough that our limits are not affected by the size of our extraction region .",
    "the field of rrat  j1846@xmath00257  ( @xmath44s , @xmath26 g , @xmath45myr , and @xmath46 ) has been imaged by various x - ray instruments during observations targeting the probably unrelated ( see section  [ sec : disc ] ) x - ray pulsar psr  j1846@xmath00258 and its supernova remnant kes  75 ( @xcite and references therein ) . among the available data , those collected with _",
    "chandra _",
    "are the best suited to search for x - ray emission from rrat  j1846@xmath00257  because of the superb angular resolution .",
    "five observations were carried out between 2000 and 2006 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) with the source positioned on the back - illuminated acis - s3 chip .",
    "we again reduced the data using ciao , applying aspect corrections and filtering the data to reject time intervals of flaring background as necessary ; see @xcite and @xcite for detailed information about the datasets .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows the image from the combined data .",
    "source detection was performed with the celldetect and wavdetect routines in ciao over numerous energy bands on each individual dataset and on a cumulative image that was obtained from the 2006 observations with a total exposure of 158ks .",
    "no x - ray source was found near the rrat  j1846@xmath00257  radio position ( j2000 : @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) . as with rrat  j0847@xmath04316",
    "we used a generous search radius of @xmath40arcsec , which combines the radio position uncertainty , the _ chandra_position uncertainty and the _ chandra _  point - spread function .",
    "based on the 8 events within this circle ( background expectation is 7 ) , this upper limit is @xmath49 in the 0.38 kev energy band , at 3@xmath3 confidence level ( again based on @xcite ) .      to interpret the count - rate limits derived in the previous sections , we need a model for the x - ray spectrum of the rrats , as well as the distance and interstellar absorption along each line of sight .",
    "for rrat  j0847@xmath04316  we take the distance of 3.4@xmath50kpc based on the observed dispersion measure and the @xcite electron density model . using the 3-dimensional galactic extinction model of @xcite , we find an optical extinction of @xmath51mag .",
    "this translates to a hydrogen column density of @xmath52 ( based on @xcite ) .",
    "this is similar to the value of @xmath53 based on the observed dispersion measure of @xmath54 and assuming 10 per cent ionisation ( similar to the @xmath55 ratio of rrat  j1819@xmath01458 ) , or the same value from the @xcite hi data - set ( likely to be an upper limit , since it is integrated through the galaxy ) .",
    "overall , values of @xmath56 seem likely , but the uncertainty is large given the poorly known distance .    for rrat  j1846@xmath00257 , we use a distance of @xmath57kpc estimated from the dispersion measure .",
    "the @xcite model gives an extinction of @xmath58mag which implies @xmath59 .",
    "we compare this with the dm - derived value of @xmath60 or the hi - derived value of @xmath61 .",
    "we also have the value of @xmath62 measured for psr  j1846@xmath00258/kes  75 , which is likely at a comparable or slightly larger distance ( 5.17.5kpc ; @xcite ) as rrat  j1846@xmath00257 .",
    "this gives us a wide range to consider , @xmath63 , again with the understanding that the large uncertainty on the distance gives an additional contribution .",
    "as an aside , we consider the possibility that psr  j1846@xmath00258 and rrat  j1846@xmath00257  were members of a binary system that was disrupted by a supernova . at 5kpc",
    "their transverse separation of @xmath64arcmin is 3.6pc . in this scenario ,",
    "the explosion that produced rrat  j1846@xmath002570.4myr ago ejected the progenitor of psr  j1846@xmath00258 , which would have been moving at a transverse velocity of @xmath65 before the second supernova explosion that created the kes  75 remnant .",
    "this velocity is actually very low for an object ejected out of a binary , which typically move at several hundred kms@xmath66 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we do not know the radial velocity of either object .",
    "waiting @xmath67myr for the second supernova seems plausible , at least based on some studies of binary evolution @xcite .",
    "if psr  j1846@xmath00258 were actually the second supernova of the system it could have interesting implications , as the progenitors of magnetars are typically thought of as quite massive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and psr  j1846@xmath00258 shares some ( but not all ) characteristics of magnetars @xcite , but being the second supernova would suggest it is less massive than its companion .",
    "mass transfer or interactions during binary evolution could likely resolve the discrepancy .",
    "we determine luminosity limits in two ways .",
    "first , we assume that the entire surface of the rrats emits as a blackbody , and we use our count - rate limits to set upper limits to the surface temperature ( measured at infinity , like all blackbody parameters discussed below ) .",
    "blackbody emission is not necessarily the best assumption as many other atmosphere models are more realistic ( e.g. , @xcite found hydrogen atmospheres gave acceptable fits for rrat  j1819@xmath01458 ) , but we keep it for simplicity . in figure  [ fig : thermal ] we give temperature limits both for a canonical 10 km neutron star radius and a 20 km radius more similar to that inferred for rrat  j1819@xmath01458@xcite , covering the wide range in @xmath68  possible for each source .",
    "[ the larger radius is not likely physical , and may reflect a combination of errors in the distance or unrealistic models for the surface emission . however , more realistic models ( .e.g , model atmospheres ) typically have _ larger _ areas than blackbodies . ]    as an alternate method , since assuming a constant emission area is not always consistent with observations of strongly pulsed neutron stars , we take the thermal spectrum measured for rrat  j1819@xmath01458 : a blackbody with @xmath69ev and unabsorbed luminosity @xmath8 @xcite . again considering the wide range in @xmath68  possible for each source , we plot the limits on the unabsorbed thermal luminosity in figure  [ fig : thermal ] for three blackbody temperatures : the nominal value 140ev , and @xmath70 per cent of that value .",
    "the main goal of the range in temperature is to show the effects of interstellar absorption and the limited energy window of _ chandra _  on the luminosity limits , although we physically motivate them in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "assuming blackbody emission from a 20 km radius and the nominal absorption , the effective temperature limit on rrat  j0847@xmath04316  is 77ev ( using @xmath71 ) .",
    "while the count - rate limit is tighter for rrat  j1846@xmath00257 , the higher likely distance and absorption ( although the dm is lower ) mean that the limit is comparable , 91ev ( for @xmath72 ) . alternately , if we take blackbody emission at a fixed temperature of 140ev we get luminosity limits of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the temperature limits for both sources are considerably cooler than for rrat  j1819@xmath01458  for almost all absorptions values .",
    "similarly , the luminosity limits for both sources are typically below that of rrat  j1819@xmath01458for a range of input spectra , often by several orders of magnitude . only for the lowest temperature considered ( 70ev ) and",
    "absorptions at the high end of the considered range do our limits become less constraining , although we must consider the correlation between distance and @xmath68 , where a larger true distance would also be associated with more absorption and hence an even weaker limit .",
    "we also consider a non - thermal spectrum ( power - law with photon index of 2 ) , which gives limits of @xmath75 and @xmath76 for j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257 .",
    "the x - ray emission from rrat  j1819@xmath01458  was assumed to be largely due to cooling emission from the neutron star surface @xcite , with only a small contribution from an extended nebula @xcite .",
    "if we expect similar emission from rrats  j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257 , it would be diminished due to their older ages ( characteristic ages of 0.8 and 0.4myr respectively , vs.  0.1myr for rrat  j1819@xmath01458 ) . in the neutrino - dominated cooling regime ,",
    "the temperature declines slowly with time , with surface temperature @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the transition to photon - dominated cooling typically occurs around 0.11.0myr , and after that the decline is much steeper and dependent on the nature of the envelope , but exponents of 13 are common .",
    "so in the worst case , and assuming that characteristic age is correlated with true age ( something that is not necessarily true ; e.g. , @xcite ) we would expect tiny temperatures @xmath78ev for rrats  j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257  that would be undetectable . however , we know of other neutron stars with similar characteristic ages with luminosities of @xmath79 ( e.g. , psr  b1055@xmath052 with characteristic age 0.5myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also know that characteristic age ( and even true age ) do not always correlate strictly with effective temperature @xcite .",
    "so while it is tempting to say that the rrats studied here are older and colder than rrat  j1819@xmath01458 , that may be misleading .",
    "while the unknown distance and column densities limit the strength of any conclusions , our data may actually provide upper limits on the luminosities of two sources that point to a range in x - ray emission among the rrats .",
    "the rrats lie close to the ins in the @xmath80-@xmath81 plane in a region with few other pulsars , and appear like the ins to have preferentially long periods ( although there are substantial selection effects ; @xcite ) .",
    "our x - ray non - detections of the rrats are actually consistent over most of the range in @xmath82 with emission like that seen from the ins : blackbodies with @xmath83ev and luminosities @xmath84 .",
    "they are generally consistent with a cooling sequence that also includes the younger pulsars like psr  b0656 + 14 and psr  b1055@xmath052 @xcite , although the details of the emission are difficult and there could be a small contribution from magnetic field decay ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see below ) .",
    "while the characteristic ages of the ins are a factor of 48 older than those of the rrats considered here , the true ages are likely comparable ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . if the rrats and the ins were drawn from a single cooling sequence that evolved with the characteristic age , we would expect j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257  to lie somewhere between 140ev ( j1819@xmath01458 ) and 70ev ( the mean of the ins ) , with the luminosity declining accordingly . in that case",
    "the rrats could be at @xmath84 for much of the considered range in @xmath82 , and significantly deeper observations would be required to understand the true nature of their emission . considering true age rather than characteristic age",
    "complicates the situation as the rrats do not have any such measurements , but the general argument still holds .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of rrat  j1819@xmath01458  is above the spin - down luminosity @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , implying that rotationally - powered non - thermal processes can not drive the x - ray emission , contrary to what is seen for many rotation - powered pulsars ( @xmath87 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but consistent with the ins .",
    "the non - thermal contributions to the x - ray emission from rrats  j0847@xmath04316  and j1846@xmath00257would be @xmath88 , below our limits even for optimistic values of the distance and @xmath68 .",
    "therefore our limits can not really constrain the expected level of non - thermal emission from these sources .",
    "we note , though , that the observed spin - down luminosity appears too low to power the extended x - ray emission observed around rrat  j1819@xmath01458  ( interpreting it as a pulsar wind nebula ) requiring some other energy source @xcite , which is also a possible conclusion about the nebula around the ins rx  j1856.5@xmath03754 @xcite .    a final possibility for the emission of rrat  j1819@xmath01458  is that , while the spectrum is thermal , the emission we see is cooling augmented by magnetic field decay ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "while the exact field decay mechanisms and timescales are still uncertain @xcite , field decay may be relevant for objects of ages @xmath89myr and magnetic fields @xmath90 g @xcite , which is the correct range for the rrats considered here .",
    "we would expect generally that for objects of similar ages ( such that the same decay mechanisms are operating ) the luminosity due to field decay would scale as @xmath91 @xcite , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the relevant decay timescale which may itself depend on @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "there are many complexities and dependencies ( magnetic field configuration , temperature effects , etc . )",
    "that we must ignore here , but if the heating is due to ohmic diffusion @xcite then the timescale is independent of @xmath94 and the luminosity should scale as @xmath95 .",
    "so the factor of @xmath96 difference in dipolar magnetic field between rrat  j1819@xmath01458  and the others would lead to at most a factor of 4 difference in instantaneous thermal luminosity .",
    "once again , this is consistent with our limits but the large uncertainties in the distances and absorptions make conclusions difficult . additionally , this energy takes time to diffuse to the surface , so the flux we see now may represent a different set of conditions in the past when the difference in magnetic field was even wider , if decay makes the field strength converge to a single value as discussed by @xcite .    in summary ,",

    "j0847@xmath04316and j1846@xmath00257  show no x - ray emission from these sources . in order to derive limits on the x - ray luminosity , we have considered several models for the emission based on the one rrat with an x - ray counterpart ( j1819@xmath01458 ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation is thermal emission from a cooling neutron star , but non - thermal emission driven by the magnetosphere and thermal emission driven by magnetic field decay are also possibilities .",
