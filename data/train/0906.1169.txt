    "there is no telescope as massive as the lmt above 4500  metres anywhere else and one can barely expect to operate at that altitude with temperatures above freezing .",
    "the development of the lmt site led to the interest and development of other scientific facilities benefiting from the high altitude conditions and sharing the same basic infrastructure . in july 2007",
    "the base of sierra negra was selected as the site for the high altitude water erenkov ( hawc ) gamma - ray observatory , an instrument whose performance depends critically on its 4100  m altitude location .",
    "sierra negra , also known as tliltepetl , is a 4580  meter volcano inside the parque nacional pico de orizaba , a national park named after the highest mountain of mexico . with an altitude of 5610  m pico",
    "de orizaba , also known as citlaltepetl , is one of the seven most prominent peaks in the world , where prominent is related with the dominance of the mountain over the region @xcite .",
    "the parque national pico de orizaba has an area of 192  km@xmath0 enclosing the two volcanic peaks , separated by only 7  km from top to top , and their wide bases .",
    "tliltepetl is an inactive volcanic cone formed 460,000 years ago , much earlier than citlaltepetl whose present crater was created just 4100 years ago and has a record of activity within the last 450 years , including the flow of 0.1  km@xmath1 of lava in 1566 and a last eruptive event in 1846 @xcite .",
    "these two peaks are located at the edge of the mexican plateau which drops at the east to reach the gulf of mexico at about 100  km distance , as shown on the left side of fig .",

    ". the development of the lmt site led to the installation of further scientific facilities benefiting from its strategic location and basic infrastructure like the 5  m radio telescope rt5 , a solar neutron telescope and cosmic ray detectors , among others . in july 2007 the base of sierra negra , about 500  m below the summit , was chosen as the site of the high altitude water erenkov ( hawc ) observatory , a @xmath4 water erenkov observatory for mapping and surveying the high energy @xmath5-ray sky .",
    "hawc will be complemented by two atmospheric air erenkov telescopes , the omega ( observatorio mexicano de gammas ) formerly part of the hegra array  @xcite .",
    "the seeing of sierra negra was monitored between 2000 and 2003 to quantify the potential of the site for optical astronomy .",
    "the site has a median seeing of 0.7 \" , consistent with of a prime astronomical site  @xcite .",
    "the wind velocity at 200 mbar has been analyzed using the noaa ncep / ncar reanalysis database showing that sierra negra is comparable to the best observatory sites as mauna kea in terms of applying adaptive optics techniques such as slow wavefront corrugation correction @xcite , based on the premise that global circulation of atmospheric winds at high altitude can be used as a criterion to establish the suitability of a site for the development of adaptive optics technique as the wind velocity at 200  mbar is strongly correlated to the average wavefront velocity allowing to compute the coherence time @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "different scientific facilities seek particular conditions and their dependence on meteorological conditions vary . among the sierra negra facilities we can note :    * the large millimeter telescope requires minimum atmospheric opacity in the millimeter range , which translates in a reduced water vapour column density . according to design specifications , lmt operation at 1",
    "mm require wind velocities below 9  m  s@xmath7 and the antenna is able to survive winds up to 250 km / h ( 69.4  m  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "* the rt5 5  m radio telescope will operate at 43 and 115  ghz for observations of the sun .",
    "nighttime work will focus on interstellar masers and monitoring of mm - wave bright active galactic nuclei .",
    "rt5 requires absence of clouds in the line of sight . *",
    "optical and atmospheric erenkov telescopes require clear nights and relatively low humidity ( below 80% ) during nighttime .",
    "* water erenkov observatories like hawc seek high altitude environments which allow for a deep penetration of atmospheric particle cascades .",

    "the texas station registered the same median temperature , but with somewhat larger variations and more marked extremes : @xmath15c and @xmath16c .",
    "as it would be expected that both stations register the same extreme temperature , it is required to perform some experiments to determine if these differences are real or are due to the distinct temperature sensors sensitivity to extreme conditions .",
    "we plan to carry out such experiments . in any case",
    "the temperatures at the site do not show large variations .",
    "the daily cycle , quantified as the difference between the night and day medians , is 1.77@xmath14c , going from 0.26@xmath14c to 2.03@xmath14c respectively .",
    "a similar value is obtained for seasonal variations : the median and third quartile ( @xmath17 ) values for dry / wet differ by only 1.76@xmath14c and 1.09@xmath14c respectively . the lowest quartile does show a larger -but still mild- difference , close to 2@xmath14c . in fig .",

    "if we consider the altitude of the site and the temperature gradient of a standard atmosphere model , @xmath20 , the corresponding sea - level temperature is @xmath21c , about @xmath22c above the standard atmosphere base value .",
    "this is clearly an effect due to the low latitude , which results in a warmer temperature at a high altitude site .",
    "a final remark is that the site presents a good degree of thermal stability , beneficial for scientific instruments : thermal stability will help the performance of the lmt , designed to actively correct its surface to compensate for gravitational and thermal deformations .",
    "the barometre of the texas weather station did not provide meaningfull data and these had to be discarded .",
    "we discuss only the data from the davis weather station . to verify the calibration of the davis barometre we performed a comparison with a basic water barometre , for about 3 hours during daytime , obtaining a pressure of 594  mbar , in very good agreement with the davis barometre reading of 592.4  mbar .",
    "therefore , the davis weather station gives readings accurate to within 2.4  mbar .",

    "the daily cycle is in fact a double 12 hour cycle , with maxima at 11h and 23h and minima at 5h and 17h .",
    "this semidiurnal pressure variation of a few mbar is well known for low latitude zones .",

    "we note that while the weather is usually poorer in the wet season , these good conditions happened in august , indicating that good observing conditions can happen any time of year ; the largest atmospheric pressure during the dry season occurred on 7/3/2004 at 10:35  am , when the weather record indicated a pressure of 594.3  mbar , temperature of 5.9@xmath14c and a relative humidity of just 12% .    the lowest pressure corresponded to what has presumably be the worst weather on site : the relatively close passage of hurricane dean , on 22/8/2007 . at 4:30am when the pressure dropped to 580.2  mbar , practically 10  mbar below the site median , with a temperature of @xmath23c and relative humidity of 92% .",
    "the same day registered the lowest daytime pressure , 580.8  mbar , at 10 am , when the temperature had _ dropped _ to @xmath24c .",
    "bad weather occasionally occurs early in the year , like on the 17/1/2004 at 6:20  am when the pressure reached its lowest dry season value , 581.6  mbar , with a temperature of @xmath25c and 85% relative humidity .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ pres3dq2 ] , there is no significative difference between the cumulative distribution of atmospheric pressure values between day and night , presumably because of the actual 12  hour cycle .",

    "the grey scale diagram in fig .",
    "[ pres3dq2 ] shows that the main seasonal effect on pressure seems to be a shift the daily cycle to later hours in june - july ; the minima move from 4  am and 4  pm in december / january to 6  am/6  pm in june / july .",

    "the rh values for day and nighttime are 68.19% and 69.35% . when folded by months , the data show a clear seasonal modulation with lower values between november and march , @xmath37 and higher humidity between june and october with a median @xmath38 as illustrated in fig .",
