    "the formal series enumerated by special cases of the truncated and infinite j - fraction series of this form include _ ordinary _ ( as opposed to typically closed - form _ exponential _ ) _ generating functions _ for many one and two - index combinatorial sequences including the generalized factorial functions studied in the references and in the results from flajolet s articles .",

    "in addition , we show that we can differentiate these new infinite square series expansions termwise with respect to @xmath33 thus allowing us to generate series for higher - order derivatives of the _ jacobi theta functions _ , which are generated as particular cases of the geometric square series , @xmath36 , in @xcite and which similarly arise in many well - known identities and classical expansions of special products and partition function generating functions .",
    "more precisely , if we let @xmath38 denote an arbitrary sequence depending on the fixed parameter @xmath1 , we seek to explore the analogous @xmath1-series - related j - fraction expansions enumerating this sequence in the form of @xmath39 we can always solve for the sequences of implicit coefficients , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in which ( at least formally ) generate the sequence of @xmath42 over @xmath33 .",
    "typically we find that for more well - known @xmath1-series generating function forms it is easy to computationally `` _ _ guess _ _ '' exact formulas for these sequences , which are each implicit functions of the @xmath43 s , in many special case forms .",
    "we conjecture , but do not offer conclusive proofs , that we have related @xmath1-series generating functions enumerating variants of the sequences , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 over @xmath33 defined by the implicit subsequence listings given in table [ table_conclusions_specialj - fraction_conjsubseq_results ] .",
