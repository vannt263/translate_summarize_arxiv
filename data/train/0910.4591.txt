    "it is well known that tumor tissues are often stiffer than normal tissues .",
    "for instance , a normal mammary gland has an elastic modulus of about @xmath0 hpa , which may dramatically increase for a breast tumor up to about @xmath1 kpa @xcite .",
    "for this reason self - palpation is often a successful tool of pre - diagnosis for the detection of possible stiffer nodules , therefore so encouraged . in most cases ,",
    "the increased stiffness is due to the presence of a denser and more fibrous stroma @xcite coming from a considerable change in the content of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) . indeed , as reported in @xcite , doubling the percent amount of collagen would increase the stiffness of a tissue by almost one order of magnitude ( @xmath2 pa and @xmath3 pa for a @xmath0 mg / ml and a @xmath1 mg / ml collagen mixture , respectively ) .",
    "the percentage of ecm also changes within the same tumor type during tumor progression @xcite .",
    "the continuous remodeling of ecm is a physiologically functional process , because it allows to keep the stroma young and reactive .",
    "in fact , prolonged rest is detrimental for bones and muscles , while physical training has an opposite effect .",
    "the ecm is constantly renewed through the concomitant production of matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) and new ecm components . in stationary conditions ,",
    "remodeling of ecm is a slow process : for instance , in human lungs the physiological turnover of ecm is @xmath4 to @xmath5 per day @xcite , which leads to an estimated complete turnover in a period of nearly one week .",
    "however , when a new tissue has to be formed , e.g. to heal a wound , the rate of production is one or two order of magnitude faster @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the remodeling process is strongly affected by the stress and the strain the tissue undergoes , as clearly occurs for bones , teeth , and muscles @xcite .",
    "hence , the relation between the rate of production / degradation of ecm constituents and the pressure felt by the cells is rather complicated .    increased presence of ecm does not characterize only many tumors but was also observed in other pathologies like intima hyperplasia , cardiac , liver , and pulmonary fibrosis , asthma , colon cancer @xcite .",
    "the alteration in the ecm composition can be due to several probably concurring reasons , including increased synthesis of ecm proteins , decreased activity of mmps , upregulation of tissue - specific inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( timps ) .",
    "the interaction between ecm and cells is also attracting the attention of many research for other reasons .",
    "indeed , on the one hand cells must adhere properly in order to survive , a phenomenon called _ anoikis _ , as well as be anchored to the ecm to undergo mithosis . on the other hand , the interaction with the stroma has been argued to be one of the causes of tumor progression @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a general multiphase mathematical model able to describe the formation of fibrosis through either excessive production of ecm or underexpression of mmps .",
    "the model is based on the frameworks deduced in @xcite , taking also cell - ecm adhesion into account .",
    "in particular , ecm is regarded as a rigid scaffold while the cell populations ( tumor and healthy cells ) are assumed to behave similarly to elastic fluids .",
    "more realistic constitutive models , taking cell - cell adhesion into account and comparing theoretical and experimental results , can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the sake of conciseness , we refrain from citing here all papers dealing with multiphase models of tumor growth , and refer to the recent reviews @xcite for more references .",
    "in more detail , sect .",
    "[ sect : multiphase ] derives and describes the model , which is then studied from the qualitative point of view in sect . [ sect : spathomog ] , having in mind the general dependence on the parameters stemming from biology .",
    "existence , uniqueness , and continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data is proved in the spatially homogeneous case , and equilibrium configurations are discussed .",
    "these theoretical investigations reveal several interesting features of the model , for instance the fact that it predicts no other equilibria but the fully physiological and the fully pathological ones , featuring no tumor cells and no healthy cells , respectively .",
    "the physiological equilibrium turns out to be stable in the manifold with no tumor cells , but becomes unstable as soon as few tumor cells are present , which trigger the formation of fibrotic tissue .",
    "in the multiphase modeling approach , tumors are regarded as a mixture of several interacting components whose main state variables are the volume ratios , i.e. , their percent amounts within the mixture . with a view to providing a simplified , though still realistic , description of the system ,",
    "we confine our attention to two cell populations : tumor cells , with volume ratio @xmath6 , and healthy cells , with volume ratio @xmath7 , moving within a remodeling extracellular matrix with volume ratio @xmath8 . clearly , @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , we obtain the main governing equations for the cellular matter by joining the mass balance equation and the corresponding balance of linear momentum ( with inertial effects neglected ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the duplication / death rate , and @xmath14 the cell motility tensor within the matrix .",
    "cells are regarded as elastic balloons forming an isotropic fluid , and are assumed to feature equal mechanical properties , hence their stress tensor is @xmath15 for a pressure - like function @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the model accounts for the attachment / detachment of the cells to / from the matrix by means of a stress threshold @xmath17 , which switches cell velocity on or off according to the magnitude of the actual stress sustained by cells in interaction with the matrix ( see @xcite for further details ) .    in the application to matrix remodeling and fibrosis",
    ", we consider that cells duplicate and die mainly on the basis of the amount of matrix present in the mixture . in general , also the availability of some nutrients plays a major role , but in the present context we assume that they are always abundantly supplied to the cells .",
    "specifically , we set @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the overall volume ratio occupied by cells and matrix , and @xmath20 is the net growth rate of the cell population @xmath21 , tempered by the free space rate @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath22 s are functions bounded between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which vanish on @xmath25 and equal @xmath24 on @xmath26 ( further analytical details in sect .",
    "[ sect : spathomog ] , assumption [ hp : param ] ) .",
    "cell growth is inhibited when the amount of free space locally available is too small ( @xmath27 ) with respect to a threshold @xmath28 $ ] . at the same time , either apoptosis or anoikis can trigger cell death at rates @xmath29 , respectively , the latter taking place when a too small amount of ecm ( @xmath30 ) with respect to a given threshold @xmath31 $ ] results in an insufficient number of possible adhesion sites .",
    "usually @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . instead",
    ", a difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , may be related to a smaller sensitivity to contact inhibition clues by tumor cells @xcite . on the whole",
    ", we notice that it must be @xmath39\\times[0,\\,1 ]      \\label{eq : gamma - ineq}\\ ] ] which holds if : ( i ) @xmath40 ( smaller sensitivity to anoikis by tumor cells ) , ( ii ) @xmath41 ( different speed for the switch mechanism , e.g. because of a different uncertainty in the response to mechanical stimuli ) , ( iii ) @xmath42 ( higher capability from tumor cells to escape anoikis by surviving a greater lack of adhesion sites ) .      in general ,",
    "the ecm is a quite complicated fibrous medium . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we model it as a rigid scaffold , which makes it unnecessary to detail its stress tensor because the internal stress is indeterminate due to the rigidity constraint . under this assumption ,",
    "the evolution equation for the volume ratio @xmath8 reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the source / sink of ecm accounting for remodeling and degradation due to the motion of the cells within the scaffold .",
    "notice that , in general , @xmath8 depends on both time @xmath45 and space @xmath46 , although the latter acts mainly as a parameter in the above differential equation .",
    "matrix is globally remodeled by cells and degraded by mmps , whose concentration per unit volume is denoted by @xmath47 : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is a nonnegative , nonincreasing function ( cf .",

    "are not regarded as a constituent of the mixture , but rather as massless macromolecules diffusing in the extracellular fluid according to a reaction - diffusion equation : @xmath52 , for net production rates @xmath53 and enzyme half - life @xmath54 .",
    "actually , enzyme dynamics is much faster than that involving cell growth and death , hence it is possible to work under a quasi - stationary approximation .",
    "furthermore enzyme action is usually very local @xcite , so that also diffusion can be neglected and finally @xmath55 inserting this expression into eq . and defining @xmath56 ultimately yields @xmath57 the pathological cases possibly leading to fibrosis are either @xmath58 or @xmath59 , which imply that tumor cells produce either more ecm or less mmps than healthy cells , respectively .",
    "the spatially homogeneous problem describes the evolution of the system under the main assumption of absence of spatial variation of the state variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "this allows in particular to describe the equilibria , and the related basins of attraction , as functions of the parameters of the model .    in the sequel",
