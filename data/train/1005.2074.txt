    "it was insensitive also to dimension of the space - time and to a choice of a coordinate system .",
    "on the other hand , if such non - riemannian geometries exist , the habitual axiom of euclidean ( and riemannian ) geometry ( the straight has no thickness ) is violated .",

    "equivalency @xmath98 of vectors @xmath56 and @xmath59 is defined as follows@xmath99if vector @xmath56 is given , and one looks for vector @xmath59 at the point @xmath96 , which is equivalent to vector @xmath56 , one needs to solve two equations ( a4.1 ) with respect to position of the point @xmath100 . in the proper euclidean geometry two equations ( [ a4.1 ] ) have always a unique solution independently of dimension of the euclidean space .",
    "it means that at the point @xmath96 there is one and only one vector @xmath59 , which is equivalent to vector @xmath56 .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry is single - variant . in an arbitrary physical geometry @xmath34 two equations ( [ a4.1 ] )",

    "then at the point @xmath96 there are many vectors @xmath59 , which are equivalent to vector @xmath56 .",
    "it means that the geometry @xmath34 is multivariant . in this case",
    "the equivalence relation is intransitive , and geometry @xmath34 is nonaxiomatizable .",
    "thus , nonaxiomatizability of a physical geometry is a corollary of its multivariance .",
    "the multivariance is a natural property of a physical ( nonaxiomatizable ) geometry .",
    "multivariance is absent , when conditions ( [ g2.6 ] ) and ( a1.5a ) are fulfilled . in axiomatizable geometries",
    "the property of multivariance is absent .",
    "the axiomatizable geometries have been well studied and considered usually as `` true geometries '' . however , the axiomatizability is not a feature of a `` true geometry '' .",
    "the axiomatizability is a property of the most studied geometries . in general ,",
    "a physical geometry is multivariant , and the multivariance is a natural property of the space - time geometry .    as we have seen in introduction , the timelike straight segments in the real space - time geometry ( [ a2.3 ] )",
    "are not one - dimensional , and this property is a corollary of the geometry multivariance with respect to timelike vectors .",
    "the multivariance leads to a splitting of geometrical objects .",

    "it is interpreted as a splitting of the euclidean cylinder in a multivariant geometry . from viewpoint of @xmath31-representation",
    "the fact , that shape of cylinders @xmath111and @xmath112 are different , in general , is natural . from this viewpoint",
    "the equation ( [ a4.3 ] ) means a degeneration of cylinders in the euclidean geometry .",
    "interpretation of ( [ a4.3 ] ) as a degeneration is a more correct geometrical interpretation , because it does not use such an auxiliary structure as the linear vector space .",
    "conventional approach to the space - time geometry , when a geometry is considered to be a logical construction is poor . to obtain a true description of the space - time geometry",
    ", one needs to realize a logical reloading and transit to perception of a geometry as a science on shape and mutual disposition of geometrical objects .",
    "using this approach and considering the proper euclidean geometry , one obtains three different representations of the euclidean geometry .",
    "these representations differ in the number of block sorts , using for construction of geometrical objects .",
    "reduction of block sorts is compensated by introduction of an additional structure , which describes the rules of the eliminated block construction . in the euclidean geometry a transition from one representation to another one may be obtained by means of the formal logic .",
    "this circumstance admits one to interpret the logical reloading as a logical operation .    in the inhomogeneous geometries , where blocks are deformed",
    ", a transformation from one representation to another one becomes to be impossible , in general . in this case one",
    "uses the deformation principle , which works only in @xmath113-representation .",
    "after deformation of the standard ( euclidean ) geometry the obtained geometry appears to be nonaxiomatizable , in general .",
    "logical reloading in the proper euclidean geometry does not change this geometry .",
    "however , capacities of generalization of the proper euclidean geometry are different in different representations of this geometry .",
    "maximal capacity of generalization appears in the @xmath31-representation , where the geometry is described completely in terms of world function @xmath31 , which is a function of two points of the space .",
    "generalization of the proper euclidean geometry in the @xmath31-representation admits one to construct multivariant geometries , which are nonaxiomatizable .",
    "appearance of multivariant ( nonaxiomatizable ) geometries shows , that the conventional approach , when a geometry is a logical construction may be used only in some special cases .",
    "logical reloading to @xmath31-representation restores the old conception of geometry , as a science on a shape and mutual disposition of geometrical objects .",
    "in other words , the logical reloading to the @xmath113-representation is not a new idea .",
    "it is a return to old idea of metric geometry , which was not work without a use of the deformation principle .",
    "being equipped by the deformation principle , the metric geometry turns into the physical geometry , which is an excellent tool for description of the space - time .",
    "a use of the physical geometry admits one to describe space - time geometry of microcosm , where the geometry is multivariant and can not be described in terms of conventional riemannian geometry .",
    "the physical space - time geometry is effective in cosmology , where the space - time geometry is non - riemannian and can not be described correctly , if one supposes , that the space - time geometry is riemannian .",
    "it is interesting , that dynamics of particles is described by finite difference equations ( but not differential ) .",
    "even dynamic equations for gravitational field have the form of finite equations ( but not differential ) .",
    "it is connected with the fact , that the physical space - time geometry may be discrete .",
