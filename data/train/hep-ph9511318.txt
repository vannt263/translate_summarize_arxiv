    "the conventional approach used to determine decay rates and cross sections is to square the feynman amplitude , average over initial , and sum over final spin states .",
    "this approach is very inconvenient to implement if the number of feynman diagrams and the number of final state particles is large .",
    "this is true even with the use of all the modern tools for symbolic computation .",
    "the conventional approach also has the drawback that in summing over spin states one loses information on spin correlations .",
    "such correlations may be important for exploring new physics at future colliders .",
    "an alternative approach , which has gained popularity in the past decade , is to compute the helicity amplitudes numerically . by doing this ,",
    "spin correlations are easily explored and the process of squaring the amplitude is trivial .",
    "the idea of calculating helicity amplitudes is probably as old as the conventional approach and might even pre - date it@xcite .",
    "more recently , motivated by the need to consider more complicated processes , a number of novel methods@xcite for obtaining helicity amplitudes have been developed .",
    "most of these , however , are viable only in the limit where fermion masses can be ignored . in this limit helicity and chirality are equivalent , leading to enormous simplifications ; this is particularly evident in processes involving the @xmath0-gauge bosons .",
    "most of the recent so - called helicity methods@xcite take advantage of these simplifications@xcite .",
    "although , there have been several attempts to generalize the helicity methods for massless fermions to the massive case , the resulting procedure is rather cumbersome and requires the introduction of arbitrary reference momenta@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a simple and systematic method for calculating helicity amplitudes which works for processes involving both massless and massive fermions .",
    "the approach that we present leads to a covariant expression for the helicity amplitude in terms of a minimum number of four vector products and is independent of the basis for dirac matrices or specific forms of the spinors .",
    "thus , we believe that our approach leads to an analytic expression which is relatively simple and easy to compare with .    for illustration we apply our method to compute the helicity amplitudes for various processes involving the top quark .",
    "we consider the processes : @xmath1",
    "when evaluating a feynman amplitude involving a pair fermions and several gauge bosons , in the initial or final state , the amplitude is expressed as a sum of terms which have the form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the momenta and helicity of the external fermions .",
    "the particular labeling of the indices is chosen for convenience in the manipulations that follow .",
    "note that , as written , ( 1 ) has an even number of @xmath5-matrices sandwiched between spinors .",
    "the case where the number of @xmath5-matrices is odd is treated by setting @xmath6 .    in the usual approach",
    "one squares these terms and sums over the fermion spins to obtain a sum over terms of the form , @xmath7.\\ ] ] the traces can then be evaluated and the result will be a function of minkowski products of the external particle four momenta .",
    "the expression is then easily integrated over phase space by use of monte carlo methods . in this approach one does not need explicit values of components of free spinors ( which depend on the particular representation used for the @xmath5-matrices ) .",
    "this method is also convenient because , in addition to getting rid of the @xmath5-matrices and expressing the amplitude in terms of simple `` dot '' products , the final result is independent of the unobservable fermion spins .    in complicated cases where the amplitude involves the sum over a large number of feynman diagrams , and",
    "each diagram involves many fermion - gauge boson vertices , the number of traces and the length of the traces may render the standard approach impractical .",
    "the standard approach is also inconvenient in cases where interference effects are of interest and one may want to explicitly display the relative phases between the different feynman diagrams . in these cases",
    "it is more convenient to obtain an expression for the amplitude corresponding to each graph which is simple to evaluate numerically .",
    "the square of the amplitude is then obtained by just squaring a single complex number .    for processes that only involve massless or nearly massless fermions",
    "there have been many papers where the so called helicity methods for evaluating tree level amplitudes are developed@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard approach , the amplitude in the helicity method is expressed in terms of spinor products of the form @xmath8 in this definition the @xmath9 and @xmath10 are light - like four - vectors .",
    "the @xmath11 refer to the helicity of the fermion .",
    "note that @xmath12 , so that up to a phase @xmath13 contains essentially the same information as @xmath14 .",
    "these methods prove relatively simple to implement and lead to compact expressions valid whenever the fermion masses can be ignored .",
    "generalizations of this approach to the massive fermion case@xcite exist , but the results are cumbersome : the method requires the introduction of extra light - like momenta and the expression of the spinor for a massive particle as a sum over spinors for massless particles . consequently , as the number of external particles increases , the number of terms for each diagram grows and results quickly become unmanageable and more prone to human error . in another",
    "approach@xcite some authors found it more convenient to obtain the amplitudes by performing all the @xmath5-matrix products numerically .",
    "although this approach appears to be efficient , the result is not expressible in a simple compact analytic form which one can study .",
    "we finally note that all the approaches quoted above require writing down particular expressions for the spinors .",
    "we will see below that with the approach presented here , it is possible to actually write the amplitude in terms of `` dot '' products without the use of particular expressions for the spinors .",
    "the procedure is relatively simple and leads to compact analytic expressions which are easy to compare with and put into code to evaluate numerically or symbolically .",
    "the basic idea is to observe that ( 1 ) can be re - written as the trace , @xmath15.\\ ] ] although this trivial observation has been used by several authors in the past@xcite .",
    "there was no attempt was made to make use of the michael - bouchiat identity ( as we do below ) to obtain an expression for @xmath16 .",
    "the object , @xmath17 , is a four by four matrix in dirac space and can be expressed in terms of an orthogonal basis of the four - dimensional dirac space  @xcite .",
    "we do not follow this approach here because we found it simpler to make use of a spinor identity due to michel and bouchiat  @xcite , @xmath18 the @xmath19 s are the three pauli matrices and there is an implied sum over @xmath20 .",
    "note that in the case where @xmath21 expression  ( [ emb ] ) reduces to the usual projection operator for a state of momentum @xmath9 and helicity @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 s are defined such that , @xmath24 they are the spin vectors corresponding to the four momentum @xmath9 . for , @xmath25 a standard representation of the @xmath23 s is given by , @xmath26 where @xmath27 for the case when @xmath28 .",
    "for completeness we have included a proof of identity ( [ emb ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the identity is only valid if both spinors correspond to the same momenta . to make use of it",
    "we must generalize it to obtain an expression for @xmath16 . if @xmath29 this could be done by applying a boost operator to both sides of ( [ emb ] ) .",
    "it is , however , simpler and more general to observe that any spinor @xmath30 can be expressed in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a normalization factor .",
    "this expression is valid whether or not @xmath29 .",

    "multiplying ( 7 ) on the right by @xmath35 and using identity ( 4 ) we obtain , @xmath36 with , @xmath37 it is easy to verify that the matrix @xmath38 is unitary in helicity space as it should be . using ( [ upeqn ] ) in ( 4 )",
    "we obtain the desired generalization , @xmath39 since @xmath40 is unitary it drops out of our expressions upon summing the square of the helicity amplitudes over all helicities . thus ,",
    "if in the end one is going to sum over all helicities one can simplify ( [ meqn ] ) by setting @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting amplitudes will not correspond to the correct helicity amplitudes but the process of squaring them and summing over all helicity indices will indeed generate the correct result for the sum of the squares .    if spin correlations are of interest then one needs to make use of the specific expressions for the @xmath40 .",
