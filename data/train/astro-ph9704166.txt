    "the _ egret _ experiment aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ has detected more than 50 blazars extending out to redshifts greater than 2 ( thompson , _ et al . _",
    "it is expected that @xmath0-rays  from blazars with energies above the threshold energy for electron - positron pair production through interactions with low energy intergalactic photons will be annihilated , cutting off the high energy end of blazar spectra .",
    "such absorption is strongly dependent on the redshift of the source ( stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ) .",
    "stecker & de jager ( 1997 ) have calculated the absorption of extragalactic @xmath0-rays  above 0.3 tev at redshifts up to 0.54 and presented a comparison with the spectral data for the low redshift blazar mrk 421 .",
    "the study of blazar spectra at energies below 0.3 tev is a more complex and physically interesting subject .",
    "in addition to intergalactic absorption , one must be able to distinguish and to separate out the effects of intrinsic absorption and natural cutoff energies in blazar emission spectra .",
    "initial estimates of intergalactic absorption of 10 to 300 gev @xmath0-rays   in blazar spectra at higher redshifts have been given by stecker ( 1996 ) , stecker & de jager ( 1996 ) and madau & phinney ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , in order to calculate such high - redshift absorption properly , it is necessary to determine the spectral distribution of the intergalactic low energy photon background radiation as a function of redshift as realistically as possible .",
    "this calculation , in turn , requires observationally based information on the evolution of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ir through uv starlight from galaxies , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "conversely , observations of high - energy cutoffs in the @xmath0-ray  spectra of blazars as a function of redshift , which may enable one to separate out intergalactic absorption from redshift - independent cutoff effects , could add to our knowledge of galaxy formation and early galaxy evolution .",
    "in this regard , it should be noted that the study of blazar spectra in the 10 to 300 gev range is one of the primary goals of a next generation space - based @xmath0-ray  telescope , _ glast ( gamma - ray large area space telescope ) _ ( bloom 1996 ) as well as a number of ground - based @xmath0-ray  telescopes currently under construction .",
    "our main goal is to calculate the opacity of intergalactic space to high energy @xmath0-rays  as a function of redshift .",
    "this depends upon the number density of soft target photons ( ir to uv ) as a function of redshift , whose production is dominated by stellar emission . to evaluate the sed of the ir - uv intergalactic radiation field we must integrate the total stellar emissivity over time",
    "this requires an estimate of the dependence of stellar emissivity on redshift .",
    "previous work has either assumed that all of the background was in place at high redshifts , corresponding to a burst of star formation at the initial redshift ( stecker 1996 ; stecker & de jager 1996 ; macminn and primack 1996 ) or strong evolution ( similar to a burst ) , or no evolution ( madau and phinney 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", we use a more realistic model which is consistent with recent observational data .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) have devised a method for calculating stellar emissivity which bypasses the uncertainties associated with estimates of poorly defined luminosity distributions of evolving galaxies .",
    "the core idea of their approach is to relate the star formation rate directly to the evolution of the neutral gas density in damped ly@xmath2  systems , and then to use stellar population synthesis models to estimate the mean co - moving stellar emissivity @xmath3 ( erg / s-@xmath4-hz ) of the universe as a function of frequency @xmath5 and redshift @xmath6 ( fall , charlot & pei 1996 ) .",
    "our calculation of stellar emissivity closely follows this elegant analysis , with minor modifications as described below .",
    "damped ly@xmath2  systems are high - redshift clouds of gas whose neutral hydrogen surface density is large enough ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) to generate saturated ly@xmath2  absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars that happen to lie along and behind common lines of sight to these clouds .",
    "these gas systems are believed to be either precursors to galaxies or young galaxies themselves , since their neutral hydrogen ( hi ) surface densities are comparable to those of spiral galaxies today , and their co - moving number densities are consistent with those of present - day galaxies ( wolfe 1986 ; see also peebles 1993 ) .",
    "it is in these systems that initial star formation presumably took place , so there is a relationship between the mass content of stars and of gas in these clouds ; if there is no infall or outflow of gas in these systems , the systems are `` closed '' , so that the formation of stars must be accompanied by a reduction in the neutral gas content .",
    "such a variation in the hi surface densities of ly@xmath2  systems with redshift is seen , and is used by pei & fall ( 1995 ) to estimate the mean cosmological rate of star formation back to redshifts as large as @xmath9 .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) have estimated the neutral ( hi plus hei ) co - moving gas density @xmath10 in damped ly@xmath2  systems from observations of the redshift evolution of these systems by lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek ( 1995 ) .",
    "( here @xmath11 is the critical mass density of the universe .",
    "the deceleration parameter is assumed throughout to be @xmath12 , with cosmological constant @xmath13 . )",
    "lanzetta , _ et al .",
    "_  have observed that while the number density of damped ly@xmath2  systems appears to be relatively constant over redshift , the fraction of higher density absorption systems within this class of objects decreases steadily with decreasing redshift .",
    "they attribute this to a reduction in gas density with time , roughly of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the current gas density in galaxies .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) have taken account of self - biasing effects to obtain a corrected value of @xmath16 ; we have reproduced their calculations to obtain @xmath16 under the assumptions that the asymptotic , high redshift value of the neutral gas mass density is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 km / s - mpc ) . in a `` closed galaxy '' model , the change in co - moving stellar mass density @xmath19 , since the gas mass density @xmath10 is being converted into stars .",
    "this determines the star formation rate and consequent stellar emissivity ( pei & fall 1995 ) .    to determine the mean stellar emissivity from the star formation rate",
    ", an initial mass function ( imf ) @xmath20 must be assumed for the distribution of stellar masses @xmath21 in a freshly synthesized stellar population . to further specify the luminosities of these stars as a function of mass @xmath21 and age @xmath22 , fall , charlot , & pei ( 1996 ) use the bruzual - charlot ( bc ) population synthesis models for the spectral evolution of stellar populations ( bruzual & charlot 1993 , charlot & bruzual 1991 ) . in these population synthesis models ,",
    "the specific luminosity @xmath23 ( erg / s - hz ) , of a star of mass @xmath21 and age @xmath22 is integrated over a specified imf to obtain a total specific luminosity @xmath24 per unit mass ( erg / s - hz - g ) for an entire population , in which all stellar members are produced simultaneously ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "following fall , charlot , and pei ( 1996 ) , we have used in our calculations the bc model corresponding to a salpeter imf , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the mean co - moving emissivity @xmath28 is then obtained by convolving over time @xmath29 the specific luminosity @xmath30 with the mean co - moving mass rate of star formation , @xmath31 : @xmath32 note that the star mass formation rate @xmath33 that appears in this equation is not the same as @xmath34 , the change in total stellar mass density . this is because @xmath35 is the rate at which mass is _ permanently _ being converted into stars ; since some stellar mass is continuously being returned to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the _ instantaneous _ mass rate of star formation @xmath36 is larger than @xmath35 , the two being related by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , provided by the bc models , is the fraction of the initial mass of a generation of stars formed at @xmath25 that has been returned to the ism .      the bc models specific luminosities @xmath24 are calculated assuming that the metallicity content _ z _ during star formation is fixed at our current solar metallicity value ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "however , the metallicity content of the universe is not static , but evolves with redshift as early populations of stars return freshly synthesized metals to the interstellar medium during their various phases of mass loss .",
    "for example , in a survey of 1/3 of the known damped lyman - alpha absorbers , pettini _",
    "( 1994 ) found that the typical metallicity is 0.1 that of the present solar value at a redshift of @xmath40 .",
    "since the specific luminosity of a star of a given mass is also a function of its metallicity content ( lower metallicities give bluer spectra ) , the metallicity of a stellar population must be taken into account when integrating the mean emissivity over redshift .",
    "the effect of metallicity content in stellar population models has been examined by worthey ( 1994 ) . using the imf @xmath41 with @xmath42",
    ", worthey has calculated the mass - to - light ratios @xmath43 as a function of population age @xmath22 and metallicity @xmath44 , for the color bands @xmath45 through @xmath21 .",
    "we have plotted his @xmath43 values for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands in figures 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "one can see that for a fixed metallicity , the logarithm of the luminosity decreases approximately linearly with the logarithm of population age , and that for a fixed age the @xmath45 and @xmath46 luminosities decrease as the metallicity increases .",
    "we have made a linear fit to each fixed - metallicity @xmath47 computed data set , obtaining a metallicity correction factor factor @xmath48 , where @xmath49 designates the color band .",
    "> from the parallel linear fits made to the computed data for each @xmath50 value , it is seen that a common correction factor , @xmath51 , applied to each @xmath52 data set will bring these data into rough agreement with the @xmath53 values of @xmath47 .",
    "these correction factors are plotted in the inset figures , whose abscissa is @xmath54 and whose ordinate is the correction factor .",
    "our fit to worthey s computed data in figure 1 gives a continuous correction factor @xmath55 for @xmath56 @xmath57 m , the center of the @xmath45 band .",
    "similar fits to the @xmath46 band data ( figure 2 ) and to the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 band data ( not shown ) result in the relation    @xmath61\\approx\\left[0.33-\\frac{0.30}{\\lambda } \\right]\\log\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{\\odot}}\\right ) + \\left[0.066-\\frac{0.063}{\\lambda}\\right]\\left [ \\log\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{\\odot}}\\right)\\right]^{2},\\ ] ]    for @xmath62 m @xmath63 m .",
    "outside of this wavelength region we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that increased metallicity gives a redder population spectrum ( bertelli _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) .",
    "limitations to this correction factor include the fact that worthey s calculations only apply to stars with ages greater than @xmath66 gyr , and that the upper mass limit of his imf ( @xmath67 ) is much lower than that of the bc model which we employ ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "additional uncertainty exists below 0.3 @xmath57 m since worthey s calculations extend only to the @xmath45 band .",
    "we have chosen to assume a constant enhancement factor below @xmath69 m .",
    "for all of the above reasons , our enhancement factor @xmath51 is really a conservative lower limit to the corrections to the bc models in the ultraviolet .",
    "population synthesis models in which varying metallicity is included do exist ( bertelli _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) , and efforts to reconcile differences in computed spectra generated by these various models have been made ( charlot , worthey , and bressan , 1996 ) .",
    "the emissivity @xmath70 given in eq .",

    "we note that a similar reduction was achieved by fall , _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) by modifying the power law index in the imf ; a higher index results in a lower emissivity ( pei 1996 , personal communication ) .",

    "although the differences for @xmath70 between the no - metallcity and metallicity cases for @xmath100 are not great , _ they become substantial at larger redshifts for both optical and uv wavelengths_. this has notable effects on the opacity of the radiation background to high energy @xmath0-rays  , as will be seen in section 4 .",
    "we note that our dotted - line curves in figure 3 ( no metallicity correction ) are essentially a reproduction of the emissivities calculated by fall , _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) .    in all cases as shown in figure 3 , the stellar emissivity in the universe peaks at @xmath101 , dropping off at both lower and higher redshifts .",

    "although it is possible that uv emission from qsos alone may be able to account for the nearly complete reionization of the igm ( meiksin & madau 1993 ; fall & pei 1993 ; madau & meiksin 1994 ) , it has been argued that additional sources of of ionizing radiation are required ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ) , these perhaps being young galaxies which leak a fraction ( up to @xmath119 ) of their ionizing radiation through hii `` chimneys '' ( dove & shull 1994 ; madau & shull 1996 ) .",

    "the fact that supersymmetry neutralinos are predicted to have such weak annihilation cross sections is an important reason why they have become such popular dark matter candidates .",
    "preliminary lep 2 results give a lower limit on the mass of the @xmath143 of @xmath151 gev ( ellis , falk , olive & schmitt 1996 ) .    in the minimal supersymmetry model ( mssm ) , @xmath143 can be generally described as a superposition of two gaugino states and two higgsino states .",

    "this process is expected to occur because neutralinos are majorana fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are their own antiparticles . indeed , most of this mutual annihilation would have occured in the very early universe , a process which determines the present ( `` freeze out '' ) value of @xmath148 and leads to the relation @xmath153 , where the bracketed quantity is the thermal - averaged annihilation cross section times velocity ( ellis , _ et al . _  1984",
    "this leads to the relation that the @xmath0-ray  flux from neutralino annihilation is inversely proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the annihilation @xmath0-ray  flux is limited from below by cosmological constraints on the maximum value of @xmath148 .",
    "there are two types of @xmath0-ray  spectra produced by @xmath154 annihilations , _ viz .",
    "_ , ( 1 ) @xmath0-ray  continuum spectra from the decay of secondary particles produced in the annihilation process , and ( 2 ) @xmath0-ray  lines , produced primarily from the process @xmath155 ( _ e.g. _ , rudaz 1989 ) .",
    "the cosmic @xmath0-ray  flux from @xmath154 annihilation is proportional to the line - of - sight integral of the _ square _ of the @xmath143 particle density times @xmath156 .",
    "the continuum @xmath0-ray  production spectra from @xmath154 annihilation can be calculated for different types of neutralinos by starting with the appropriate branching ratios for annihilation into fermion - antifermion pairs which produce hadronic cascades leading to the subsequent production and decay of neutral pions ( rudaz & stecker 1988 ; stecker 1988 ; stecker & tylka 1989 ) .",
    "stecker & tylka ( 1989 ) discuss in detail the various channels involved in continuum @xmath0-ray  production via @xmath154 annihilation and give the resulting spectra for some lower mass @xmath143 particles .",
    "such continuum fluxes from @xmath154 annihilations would be difficult to observe above the extrapolated cosmic background which we show in figure 9 . however , with good enough sensitivity and energy resolution , it might be possibile to observe a two - photon annihilation line from @xmath154 annihilation .",
    "the general considerations for observability of this line were discussed by rudaz & stecker ( 1991 ) .",
    "we update this discussion here , using ( 1 ) our new calculation of the @xmath0-ray  background flux from blazars shown in figure 9 , ( 2 ) recent accelerator limits on supersymmetric particle masses , and ( 3 ) the proposed sensitivity and energy resolution of a next generation space based @xmath0-ray  telescope taken from the _ glast _ proposal ( elliot 1996 ) .    the energy of the @xmath155 decay line is @xmath157 .",
    "the line width is given by doppler broadening .",
    "for galactic halo particles , this width is roughly @xmath158 @xmath159 , much smaller than the energy resolution proposed for any future @xmath0-ray  telescope .",
    "upper and lower limits on @xmath160 yield lower and upper limits on the @xmath0-ray  line flux respectively ( see above ) .",
    "other limits can be obtained in flux - energy space ( rudaz & stecker 1991 ) .",
    "accelerator determined lower limits on @xmath161 give lower limits on the line energy .",
    "lower limits on the mass of the sfermion exchanged in the annihilation process give upper limits on @xmath162 since @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 .",
    "in fact , since the particle density @xmath165 and @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath166 , the predicted annnihilation line flux @xmath167 .",
    "further limits are obtained from the inequality @xmath168 , which is the tautology following from the condition that @xmath143 be the lsp .",
    "if we assume that annihilations occur mainly through slepton exchange , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath169 , we can obtain an upper limit on the 2@xmath0 line flux .",
    "this is because lep 1.5 gives a lower limit of @xmath139 70 gev on the slepton mass ( de boer , miquel , pohl & watson 1996 ) , whereas the substantially higher squark mass lower limit of @xmath139 150 gev would imply much lower fluxes , since @xmath170 @xmath171 .",
    "the lower limit on the slepton mass implies an upper limit on the line flux from @xmath172 annihilation such that the event rate for a next generation @xmath0-ray  telescope with an aperture of 1 m@xmath173sr would be about 5 photons per year for a line in the energy range between 20 and 100 gev .",
    "( if the @xmath143 particles are higgsinos , the event rate would be much lower . ) using all of these constraints , the allowed region for a neutralino annihilation line in flux - energy space is plotted in figure 10 .    in constructing figure 10",
    ", we have used the _",
    "glast _ proposed estimate of the point source sensitivity after a one - year full sky survey to estimate the background from unresolved faint blazars ( see figure 9 and the discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "we then obtain the background photon number for an appropriate exposure factor of 1 m@xmath173yr - sr and energy resolution of 10% , and plot the square root of this number , which represents the natural background fluctuations above which a line must be observed .",
    "of course , a higher exposure factor would reduce the point source background and increase the sensitivity to a line flux , as would a better energy resolution .",
    "it should also be noted that the background above 10 gev shown in figures 9 and 10 may be overestimated ( see previous section ) .",
    "another possible way in which dark matter may produce @xmath0-rays  and neutrinos is if the lsp is allowed to decay to non - supersymmetric , ordinary particles .",
    "supersymmetry theories involve a multiplicative quantum number called _ r - parity _ , which is defined so that it is even for ordinary particles and odd for their supersymmetric partners .",
    "thus , if r - parity is conserved , as is usually assumed , the lsp is completely stable , making it a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "however , such may not be the case .",
    "r - parity may be very weakly broken , allowing the lsp to decay with branching ratios involving @xmath0-rays  and neutrinos ( _ e.g. _ , berezinsky , masiero & valley 1991 ) . for @xmath143 particles to be the dark matter , their decay time should be considerably longer than the age of the universe",
    ".    the possible radiative decay @xmath174 will give a @xmath0-ray  line with energy @xmath175 .",
    "such a line has the potential of being more intense than the annihilation line . whereas the @xmath154 annihilation rate and consequent line flux is cosmologically limited by requiring @xmath148 to be a significant fraction near 1 ( see previous discussion ) , the decay - line flux is limited only by the particular physical supersymmetry model postulated and constraints from related accelerator and astrophysical data .",
    "thus , invocation of @xmath143 decay involves a higher order of particle theory model building and speculation .",
    "we only wish to mention here that there is a possibility that a decay line may be sufficiently intense to be observable above the background .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0-ray  opacity as a function of both energy and redshift for redshifts as high as 3 by taking account of the evolution of both the sed and emissivity of galaxies with redshift . in order to accomplish this ,",
    "we have adopted the recent analysis of fall , _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) and have also included the effects of metallicity evolution on galactic seds .",
    "we have then considered the effects of the @xmath0-ray  opacity of the universe on @xmath0-ray  bursts , blazar spectra , and on the extragalactic @xmath0-ray  background from blazars . in particular , we find that the 17 feb .",
    "1994 _ egret _ burst probably originated at @xmath176 . because the stellar emissivity peaks between a redshift of 1 and 2 , the @xmath0-ray  opacity which we derive shows little increase at higher redshifts .",
    "this weak dependence indicates that the opacity is not determined by the initial epoch of galaxy formation , contrary to the speculation of macminn and primack ( 1996 ) .",
    "the extragalactic @xmath0-ray  background , which can be accounted for as a superposition of spectra of unresolved blazars , and which we have predicted to be concave between 0.03 and 10 gev ( stecker & salamon 1996 ) , should steepen significantly above 20 gev owing to our estimates of extragalactic @xmath0-ray  absorption at moderate to high redshifts .",
    "both the predicted concavity and steepening may be too subtle to detect with present data from _",
    "egret_. however , next generation @xmath0-ray  telescopes which are presently being designed , such as _ glast _ , may be able to observe these features and thereby test the blazar background model .",
