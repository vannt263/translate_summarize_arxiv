    "in this paper , we present intermediate resolution ( @xmath16 km  s@xmath4 ) spectra of the quasar h1821 + 643 ( @xmath17 ) which is visually the brightest known object in the sky at @xmath18 .",
    "h1821 + 643 is an x - ray selected , radio - quiet quasar @xcite , and resides in a cd galaxy at the center of a rich cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of the qso have been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter authors find evidence for a strong optical / uv bump and a soft x - ray excess .",
    "the cluster of galaxies hosting the qso is one of the most luminous x - ray clusters known @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies of h1821 + 643 have been carried out in the uv at low resolution @xcite and intermediate resolution @xcite , in order to study the galactic and intergalactic medium along the line of sight .",
    "h1821 + 643 was observed by fuse on oct 10 and 13 , 1999 for a total integration time of 48.8 ksec . @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide an overview of the fuse instrument and its performance .",
    "data in the wavelength interval @xmath1  covered by both lif channels were obtained .",
    "processing steps included orbital doppler compensation , background subtraction , flux and wavelength calibration .",
    "no flat - fielding of the data was performed .",
    "the dispersion solution was derived from pre - launch calibration spectra , and adjusted based on comparison of fuse absorption line velocities to velocities of appropriate absorption lines in the stis / hst echelle spectrum of h1821 + 643 obtained by @xcite . in general , the velocities are accurate to @xmath19 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the measured spectral resolution was @xmath20 km  s@xmath4  depending on wavelength .",
    "the detector background and scattered light in the instrument are extremely low , leading to accurate knowledge of the residual intensities in absorption lines .",
    "equivalent widths and column densities of selected absorption lines were measured using the techniques described by @xcite and are reported in table 1 .",
    "spectra shown in figures 1 - 3 have been smoothed by 5 pixels ( 0.03 ) .",
    "the h1821 + 643 sight line @xmath21 passes over 3 spiral arms seen in hi  emission in a survey above the galactic plane by @xcite : ( 1 ) the intermediate arm ( @xmath22 km  s@xmath4 ) , the perseus arm ( @xmath23 km  s@xmath4 ) and the outer arm ( @xmath24 km  s@xmath4 ) . for the observations reported here @xmath25 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the sight line is also in a direction where the warp of the outer galaxy extends to large galactic latitudes .",
    "the interstellar spectrum of h1821 + 643 is dominated by lines of h@xmath26 and feii in the fuse bandpass . also present",
    "are ari , cii , siii , pii , and ovi .",
    "strong oi  and ni  lines were also detected in spectra obtained while the satellite was in the earth s shadow , where the terrestrial day glow emission lines in these species are absent .",
    "the @xmath27  region of the spectrum displaying ovi  1032,1038 , cii  @xmath21036 and several h@xmath26 lines is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the feii  lines are strong and have negative velocity wings extending out to as much as @xmath28 km  s@xmath4 for feii  @xmath21145 .",
    "these negative velocity components are formed above the outer arm , and are also seen in mgii  and siii  lines in ghrs data @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath26 lines are local and are not seen at large negative velocities .",
    "it is interesting to compare the strengths of the ari  1048,1066 lines to those in the ni  multiplet at 1134 . in a fully neutral medium",
    ", these lines should have similar equivalent widths since they have nearly similar values of @xmath29 where @xmath30 cosmic abundance , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "however , the ari  lines are noticeably weaker than the strongly saturated ni  lines in the spectra of h1821 + 643 .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that in diffuse clouds ari  is unlikely to be depleted onto dust grains .",
    "nevertheless , they argue that in regions that are partially ionized by euv radiation , ari  may appear to be deficient relative to hi  ( or ni ) because it has a substantially larger ionization cross section and thus might be more ionized .",
    "note that ari  is only clearly detected in the intermediate arm .",
    "it is not detected in the perseus or outer arms , probably because the ar is more highly ionized at greater distances from the galactic plane .",
    "the ovi  absorption at @xmath32 to @xmath33 km  s@xmath4  is associated with the outer arm and distant warp of our galaxy . if we assume that the halo corotates with the underlying disk , the implied galactocentric distance of the absorbing gas is @xmath34 kpc , and the distance above the plane is @xmath35 kpc .",
    "independent evidence for the existence of ovi  absorption in the outer halo of our galaxy is supplied by the _ absence _ of ovi  absorption at velocities exceeding @xmath36 km  s@xmath4 in the fuse spectrum of k1 - 16 , which is only @xmath37 away from h1821 + 643 on the sky , and is at a distance of 1.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "consequently , the high negative - velocity ovi  absorption seen in h1821 + 643 must be formed in the galactic halo beyond k1 - 16 .    a high negative - velocity ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) component of ovi  @xmath21031.93 is coincident with a low velocity h@xmath26 line from the @xmath38 rotational level at 1031.19 .",
    "we have modeled the @xmath39 h@xmath26 lines in the spectrum , and find a good fit for a total column density of n(h@xmath26 ) @xmath40 @xmath41 and a cloud excitation temperature of @xmath42 k. based on this model , the expected @xmath43 absorption at 1031.19  can not account for the depth or width of the observed line , indicating significant absorption by ovi  @xmath21032 at @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this confirms the tentative identification of this component in the civ  @xmath21549 line made with ghrs / hst by @xcite .",
    "this detection is quite interesting , since the line velocity corresponds to the limiting velocity of @xmath5 km  s@xmath4  for milky way gas assuming corotation and a flat rotation curve for the outer galaxy .",
    "collisional ionization seems the most likely source of ovi  ionization in this component .",
    "photoionization would require a very hard radiation field ( @xmath44 ev ) to ionize ov  to ovi , and the large photoionization parameter , @xmath45 , requires a very low value of @xmath46 and an extremely long pathlength , @xmath47 kpc , to produce the absorption ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have detected strong ( w@xmath48 m ) ly@xmath49 towards h1821 + 643 at redshifts of 0.1213 , 0.1476 , 0.1699 , 0.2132 and 0.2249 .",
    "@xcite also reported intervening ly@xmath49 absorption at @xmath50 .",
    "we have detected absorption from four of these absorbers in the fuse spectrum , and the column densities are reported in table 1 .",
    "the lyman series lines detected with fuse in these systems provide important constraints on n(hi ) since the stronger lines in the hst bandpass are saturated .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite for discussion of intervening ly@xmath6 absorbers .",
    "one must be aware of the potential for ejected material from the qso to masquerade as intervening gas , as shown for civ  absorption line systems by @xcite .",
    "we believe that there is good evidence that the absorbers in h1821 + 643 are truly intervening , based on the proximity of intervening galaxies to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a strong , blended line of ly@xmath49 at @xmath51 .",
    "in addition to detecting the the ly@xmath6 line in this system , we report the detection of a line at 1157.17  which we have identified as ovi  @xmath21032 at @xmath12 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the line is clearly seen in both the lif1 and lif2 spectra .",
    "the ovi@xmath21038  line is blended with the ly@xmath52 line in the @xmath13 absorber and could not be measured .",
    "this is the sixth _ intervening _ ovi  absorption system observed towards h1821 + 643 , and provides further evidence that low-@xmath53 ovi  systems contain a large fraction of the baryons at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "these observations are in accord with cosmological simulations by @xcite that predict a substantial fraction of present - day baryons are in a shock - heated phase at @xmath54k .",
    "we have identified an observed line at 1143.6  as ciii  @xmath2977 at @xmath11 .",
    "this identification was made possible by comparison with the wavelength of a ly@xmath49 absorber recently observed by @xcite with stis / hst .",
    "the ly@xmath55 line for this absorber is not conclusively detected in the fuse spectrum , although a weak , rather broad feature is at the predicted wavelength .",
    "the ly@xmath6 line in this absorber is redshifted into the strong galactic ni  triplet at 1200 .",
    "intervening absorption at @xmath13 has been detected in the ly@xmath49 and ly@xmath6 lines and in ovi  with hst @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have also clearly detected siiii  in this system , and the component structure establishes that this is a multiphase absorber . however , this absorber is not detected by hst in low ionization lines such as siii  or the high ionization lines of siiv  and civ .",
    "@xcite showed that the absorption could occur in low density , extended gas photoionized by the uv background or in hot collisionally ionized gas in an intervening galaxy or galaxy group .",
    "evidence for the presence of a galaxy group at @xmath13 has been provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath52 , ly@xmath56 and ly@xmath57 lines at @xmath58 are detected in the fuse spectrum .",
    "two of these lines are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the lines are clearly resolved into 2 components with velocity separation of @xmath14 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we have not identified any metal lines arising in the @xmath13 system in the fuse spectrum .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain fuse short - wavelength ( sic ) spectra covering @xmath59 , where we have the possibility of detecting the redshifted neviii770,780 doublet .",
    "neviii  has a higher ionization potential than ovi  ( 207 ev vs. 114 ev ) .",
    "if detected , it would indicate the presence of collisionally ionized gas at a temperature of @xmath60k .",
    "we report the detection of several `` associated '' ( @xmath61 ) absorption lines in the spectrum of h1821 + 643 .",
    "we identify the observed line at @xmath62 as absorption by the rest - frame euv line oiv  @xmath2787.7 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this line has a fwhm @xmath63 km  s@xmath4 , which places it in the category of narrow absorption line ( nal ) absorbers @xcite .",
    "we have also identified oiii@xmath2832.93 with an observed line at @xmath64 .",
    "finally , we have tentatively identified a weak line at @xmath65 as sv   @xmath2786 , although this line is much narrower than the oiv  @xmath2787 line .",
    "these lines can not be redshifted , higher order lyman lines , because the corresponding ly@xmath49 lines are not detected in the longer wavelength uv spectra obtained with ghrs / stis .",
    "associated absorption by ciii  @xmath2977 , siiv  @xmath21394 , civ1548,1550 , ovi  1032,1038 as well as several members of the lyman series of hydrogen have been detected in h1821 + 643 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fuse and hst observations combined show a broad range of ionization in the associated absorber(s )  including oiii , oiv , and ovi . however , no low ionization species such as mgii  or siiihas been observed .",
    "we see no evidence for neviii  770,780 absorption in the fuse data at @xmath66 .",
    "there are 3 possible sites of associated absorption in the h1821 + 643 spectrum : ( 1 ) the host galaxy of the qso , ( 2 ) the intracluster medium ( icm ) , or ( 3 ) a cluster galaxy or galaxies along the line of sight to the qso . absorbing gas which is near the qso central engine",
    "is often called `` intrinsic '' absorption . in many specific cases , there is strong spectroscopic evidence that associated nals are intrinsic .",
    "the evidence includes : ( 1 ) time variable line strengths , ( 2 ) smooth absorption that is broad compared to the thermal line width , ( 3 ) partial covering of the continuum source , and ( 4 ) presence of excited - state absorption @xcite .",
    "none of these properties convincingly describes the h1821 + 643 associated absorber .",
    "time - variability of absorption lines has not been reported , and can not be addressed with this dataset .",
    "the oiv  line is broader than its thermal line width , but is narrower than most intrinsic systems , which typically have widths of @xmath67 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the associated ly@xmath49 line observed in the hst / stis spectrum obtained by @xcite is black at the line center ( t. m. tripp , private communication ) .",
    "this requires full coverage of the continuum source . finally , excited - state absorption is not observed .",
    "all of this evidence points to the associated absorber in h1821 + 643 being unlike normal `` intrinsic '' absorbers .",
    "nevertheless , we still think that a likely origin of the associated absorption lies in the nearby environs of the h1821 + 643 host galaxy .",
    "halos of cluster galaxies will be ram - pressure stripped by their passage through the intracluster medium .",
    "gas in the icm is extremely hot ( @xmath68k ) , and will have negligible ionic fractions of oiii  and oiv .",
    "if a cooling flow exists in the cluster , then the ovi  and less ionized species formed in this cooling gas would exist close to the cd galaxy at the cluster center  the host of h1821 + 643 .",
    "the photoionization models presented by @xcite indicate that an ionization parameter of @xmath69 ( for a wide range of continuum shapes ) is needed to simultaneously produce oiv  and ovi , but then the fractional ionization of oiii  will be much too low to explain the absorption we detect .",
    "hence , a multiphase model is required to explain the broad range of ionization present in the h1821 + 643 absorber .",
    "multiple sites for the formation of the absorption is also consistent with the oiv  @xmath2787 line width .",
    "this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa fuse mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
