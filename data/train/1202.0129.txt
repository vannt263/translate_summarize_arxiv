    "the presence of extra dimensions is playing a fundamental role in solving the hierarchy problem , explaining physical interactions based on common principles and other problems in high energy physics @xcite . under the condition of no undesirable physical consequences obtained",
    ", as we know so far , any realistic candidate for a grand unified theory should be multidimensional .",
    "because of the absence of observational and experimental data , preference makes no difference in discriminating various kinds of multidimensional models of gravity .",
    "actually , all sorts of models have been studied in extra dimension gravity .",
    "the concept of brane scenario was introduced in 1983 by robakov and shaposhnikov , who pointed out that we live in a topological defect embedded in 5-dimensional spacetime , i.e. , domain wall , or thick brane in modern terminology which was used as a new approach to solve the problem of the unobservability of the extra dimensions @xcite . according to the idea , particles corresponding to electromagnetic ,",
    "weak and strong interactions are confined on some hypersurface called a brane . only gravitation and some exotic matter",
    "could propagate in the extra dimension .",
    "and in @xcite the authors found that particles with spin 0 and 1/2 can be trapped on the domain wall described by a scalar field without gravity . during the 80s and the early 90s , one of the most striking facts which activated the studies on brane models was the development in superstring theory and m - theory since the mid of 90s , especially the discovery of d - brane solutions @xcite . in 1999 ,",
    "randall and sundrum ( rs ) proved that gravitation also can be localized on the brane if one takes the gravity into consideration @xcite .",
    "this is the famous rs brane model which attracts much concentration from physicists because of its theoretic value , observable effect and solving the long - standing hierarchy problem and cosmological constant problem . and",
    "graviton resonances were previously considered in thick brane scenario in @xcite .",
    "so far , various thick brane or domain wall solutions have been investigated ( a review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the trapping of all kinds of matter fields on the single - brane or multi - branes are also discussed for both thin or thick branes @xcite .",
    "all of these works only considered the contribution of spacetime curvature without torsion . in this paper",
    "we would like to investigate thick brane solutions caused by the spacetime torsion .",
    "an applicable theory is the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr)@xcite which instead of using the curvature defined via the levi- civita connection , it uses the weitzenbck connection that has no curvature but only torsion .",
    "this theory allows us to interpret general relativity as a gauge theory for a translation group . and",
    "in this context , gravity is not due to curvature , but to torsion , and torsion accounts for gravitation not by geometrizing the interaction , but by acting as a force .",
    "a question that will be asked is that what is the role of torsion or the difference between torsion and curvature @xcite .",
    "although the equations of motion in teleparallel gravity are dynamically equivalent to those in general relativity and relate to the same degrees of freedom of gravity ( more general relativity theories , like einstein - cartan and gauge theories for the poincar and the affine groups , consider curvature and torsion as representing independent degrees of freedom ) , the teleparallel gravity describes a different geometry , the weitzenbck spacetime .",
    "the spacetime metric @xmath2 plays no dynamical role in the teleparallel description of gravitation .",
    "if we want to investigate the influence of spacetime torsion , we should modify the teleparallel gravity .",
    "following the spirit of @xmath3 gravity ( see @xcite for a review , @xcite for applications in braneword ) , a generalization of teleparallel gravity is @xmath0 gravity which was first proposed by bengochea and ferraro to explain the observed acceleration of the universe @xcite . and",
    "models based on modified teleparallel gravity were also found to provide an alternative to inflation without inflaton @xcite .",
    "it therefore has attracted some attention recently .",
    "more recently , linder @xcite proposed two new @xmath0 models to explain the accelerating expansion and found that the @xmath0 theory can unify a number of interesting extensions of gravity beyond general relativity .",
    "the fact that we should note is that @xmath0 gravity could be a phenomenological extension of the teleparallel gravity , inspired by the @xmath3 generalization of the general relativity . although the @xmath3 gravity is probably not the low - energy limit of some fundamental theory , it does include models that can be motivated by effective field theory .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 gravity seems at this stage to be just an _ ad hoc _ generalization .",
    "recently it was pointed out that @xmath0 gravity violates the local lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it still attracts an increasing interest in the literature because of its advantage over @xmath3 gravity , namely , its field equations are at most second - order instead of fourth - order",
    ". the validity of @xmath0 gravity as an alternative also has been investigated by analyzing the large - scale structure @xcite and the observational constraints on model parameters @xcite . apart from obtaining acceleration",
    ", one can reconstruct a variety of cosmological evolutions @xcite , can consider the possibility of the phantom divide crossing @xcite , and can investigate the vacuum and matter perturbations @xcite beyond the background evolution . for other investigations , see for examples @xcite .    considering the increasing interest in @xmath0 gravity and the possibility as an alternative to general relativity , in this paper we investigate the impact of torsion instead of curvature on the structure of thick branes and the localization of fermions on the thick branes .",
    "the spacetime torsion can result in the splitting of the thick brane with an internal structure which is called double - kink defect since it seems to be composed of two standard kinks . in the works of bazeia and his collaborators",
    "@xcite a class of defect structures were obtained by a @xmath4 potential .",
    "the appearance of the structure will result in a split in the matter energy density in the center of the brane . and",
    "the resonances of gravitons and fermions in the such structure scenario have been considered in recent works @xcite . in our work",
    "we use the resonance detecting method to analyze the kk modes of fermion fields and how the internal structure due to geometric effect influence the resonances of fermion in the splitting brane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we first give a brief review of the teleparallel gravity and then give the field equations for the five - dimensional @xmath0 brane . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , because their equations are still second order , we obtain some exact analytic domain wall solutions for a given warped factor . in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] , we study the localization of fermion fields on the thick branes by presenting the potential of the schrdinger equations .",
    "before we set up our model , let us briefly give a review of the teleparallel gravity . in teleparallel gravity",
    ", it is the vierbein or tetrad fields , @xmath5 ( rather than the metric ) that work as the dynamical variables . at each point of the manifold ,",
    "the tetrad fields form an orthonormal basis for the corresponding tangent space of the point . in four - dimensional teleparallel gravity ,",
    "latin indices @xmath6 and greek indices @xmath7 both run from 0 to 3 , label coordinates of the tangent space and the spacetime , respectively . for a specified spacetime coordinate basis",
    "the components of @xmath5 are @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , @xmath8 are both spacetime vectors and lorentz vectors .",
    "the relation between the tetrad fields and the metric is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the minkowski metric for the tangent space . from the relation  ( [ 1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath11    instead of using the levi - civita connection @xmath12 , we would like to apply the weitzenbck tensor @xmath13 and the torsion @xmath14 to establish the teleparallel gravity .",
    "the difference between the levi - civita connection and weitzenbck connection is the well - known contortion tensor  @xcite @xmath15.\\ ] ] by defining a tensor @xmath16 : @xmath17},\\ ] ] one can write the lagrangian of the teleparallel gravity as @xcite @xmath18,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the determinant of the metric @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that the teleparallel gravity is equivalent to general relativity .",
    "therefore , in order to discuss the effects of the torsion , we have to generalize the gravity .    as to the @xmath0 gravity , we need only to replace the @xmath21 in lagrangian by an arbitrary differentiable function of @xmath21 , and then the action in five - dimensional gravity is @xmath22 where we have taken @xmath23 for convenience .",
    "the corresponding field equations read @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field .",
    "capital latin indices @xmath28 . here",
    "the field equations are expressed in purely spacetime form , not containing coordinates of the tangent space .    in our work",
    "we consider the static flat braneworld scenario with the metric @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the four - dimensional minkowski metric , and @xmath31 is the warped factor .",
    "then the tetrad fields are @xmath32 , @xmath33 . from now on",
    ", the prime always denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath34 , unless specified .",
    "although the model is a second - order derivative theory , it is hard to give an analytic solution for general cases . for simplicity ,",
    "let us take @xmath40 and consider the following cases .      for @xmath42 , eqs .",
    "( [ equ2 ] ) and ( [ equ1 ] ) reduce to @xmath43 they are the same equations as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the gravity is described by general relativity . as a consequence ,",
    "the solutions of this case are equivalent to those in the case @xmath44 .",
    "a domain wall solution has been obtained in  @xcite by using a superpotential approach : @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath46 is a parameter which fixes the thickness of the wall . as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , as @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the spacetime described by the metric ( [ metric ] ) and is asymptotically @xmath49 .      with the substitution of into , we should have the following condition @xmath51 to make the right side of non - minus .",
    "only when is satisfied , we can obtain a real function solution .",
    "note that the existence of @xmath52 constraints the values of @xmath50 and @xmath53 .    for @xmath54 , we yield an analytic domain wall solution : @xmath55+\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\sqrt{1 + 72kb^2\\alpha^2+(1 - 72kb^2\\alpha^2)\\cosh(2\\alpha y)}\\tanh(\\alpha y)\\bigg],\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are the first and second kind elliptic integrals , respectively . one can prove that @xmath57 is real provided that @xmath58 as required by . specially , when @xmath59 , @xmath60 which is a kink solution .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath61 , the solution turns to be a double - kink , as shown in fig.[phi ] .     plotted with @xmath62 . with the decrease of @xmath53",

    "for different values @xmath50 , via numerical approach , we find that the solution is a kink when @xmath71 and a double kink as @xmath72 is less than some negative value . from eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) , we can see that the domain wall solution turns out to be a double - kink solution when the contribution from the second term of right side exceeds the first term .",
    "so @xmath72 shows the strength of the geometrical effect of torsion .",
    "commonly , the appearance of a double - kink solution means that the domain wall at @xmath73 symmetrically splits into two branes . this can be seen from the distribution of the energy density @xmath74 as shown in fig .",
    "[ density ] .",
    "locations of those two peaks are where two sub - branes inhabit . at the boundary of the spacetime @xmath75",

    "a trend of brane - splitting can be seen from the transition.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated the split of thick brane , which is generated by a complex scalar field coupled to gravity .",
    "they showed that the split of the brane is due to a first - order transition when the temperature approaches the critical value and a new disordered phase would appear between these two sub - branes .    at zero temperature , the split of thick brane",
    "was realized by using a real scalar field @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the engendered internal structure depends on a real parameter , which changes the self - interaction of the scalar field .",
    "the split of brane was also investigated by using two real scalar fields  @xcite .    in our work , the internal structure is different , because the energy density of the scalar field is non - vanished at @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "such a structure indicates that the split of the brane is incomplete , and there is a connection between the two sub - branes . while for the case with @xmath80 , the original brane is completely split , and the newly generated branes are independent .",
    "the energy density dwelling on the split branes becomes more notable with the increase of the contribution from torsion to which the phase transition is due .",
    "it indicates that the geometric effect will influence the distribution of the energy density .",
    "it should be noted that the distance between the two split branes is mainly determined by @xmath46 and @xmath81 , which also determine the thickness of the domain wall .",
    "a probable explanation to the changeable @xmath53 is that @xmath53 might relates to the evolution of universe .",
    "note that the temperature of the cosmological background is a characteristic parameter relevant to the evolution , so we can recognize @xmath53 as a function of temperature .",
    "therefore , there might exists a critical temperature @xmath82 , at which , the brane splits into two sub - branes .",
    "whether various bulk fields could be confined to the brane by a natural mechanism is an interesting and important issue to build up the standard model .",
    "it has been known that massless scalar fields  @xcite and gravitons  @xcite can be localized on branes of different types .",
    "abelian vector fields can be localized on the rs brane in some higher - dimensional cases  @xcite or on thick ds branes and weyl branes  @xcite .",
    "the localization of fermion fields is also interesting . in order to localize fermions ,",
    "the coupling between the fermion fields and the background scalars should be introduced . with different scalar - fermion couplings ,",
    "a single bound state and a continuous gapless spectrum of massive fermion kk states can be obtained , see for example  @xcite . in some other models , there exist finite discrete kk states ( mass gap ) and a continuous gapless spectrum starting at a positive @xmath84 @xcite or even only exist bound kk modes .    from the results in refs .",
    "@xcite we note that the effective potentials of the kk modes of scalar and vector fields are free of gravity model and only dependent on @xmath85 .",
    "it can be easily verified that the zero mode of these fields can be localized on the brane we obtianed here . however , the effective potentials of fermion fields couple to the background scalar , so the localization is model - dependent .    in this section",
    "we will investigate how the spacetime torsion influences the localization of fermion fields on the brane .",
    "following the suggestion on fermion fields in refs .",
    "@xcite , the equations will also be equivalent to the case in general relativity .",
    "thus we can take the approach in general relativity , only in appropriate time we take our results into consideration . via performing the conformal transformation @xmath86 @xcite , we can rerepresent the metric in conformal coordinates . taking the simply yukawa coupling ,",
    "the 5-dimensional dirac action of a massless spin 1/2 fermion coupled to the background scalar @xmath87 is @xmath88 the non - vanishing components of the spin connection @xmath89 for the background metric are @xmath90 where prime denotes the derivation with respect to conformal coordinate @xmath91 from now on , and @xmath92 is the spin connection on the brane and vanishes here .",

    "for positive @xmath94 , @xmath116 . from fig .",
    "[ localization ] , it can be seen that @xmath117 vanishes at infinity , therefore there is only one bound massless mode for left - chiral fermions followed by a continuous gapless spectrum of kk states with @xmath118 .    from fig .",
    "[ localization ] , we find that , with the decrease of @xmath53 , the height of the potential well will increase , then there will be two minima in the potential well , namely double well .",
    "although there is only one bound massless mode , but some resonances may appear which can tunnel from the brane to the bulk . in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ localization ] , only the zero mode exists .",
    "but for colorblue@xmath119 there exists an extra resonance with @xmath120 , probability @xmath121 and odd wavefuction . for @xmath122",
    ", there are two resonances with @xmath123 . for @xmath124",
    ", the resonances increase to three , @xmath125 .",
    "so the resonant states will increase with the contribution from torsion .",
    "for the right - chiral kk modes , there have no bound modes but continuous and gapless spectra which are the same with the left - chiral kk modes .",
    "note that the height of the potential well will also increase with @xmath81 and @xmath46 , but the width becomes narrower , then there will be a double well with a smaller @xmath126 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath94 can also affect the width and the height of the well , but there will be no transition from one minimum in the potential well to two minima . similarly the well has a smaller @xmath126 .",
    "next we discuss the condition of the localization .",
    "the zero mode for the left - chiral fermions reads  @xcite @xmath127 in order to check whether the zero mode can be localized on the brane , we should check whether the normalization condition for the zero mode is satisfied , namely , whether the integral @xmath128 is finite .",
    "since @xmath129 when @xmath130 , so it is clear that the integral  ( [ integral ] ) is finite for positive @xmath94 , namely , the zero mode for left - chiral fermions can be localized on the brane for positive @xmath94 .    since @xmath77",
    ", we can get a simple expression of the warped factor in conformal coordinate , i.e. , @xmath112 . at the infinity , @xmath131 , hereby , @xmath132 where @xmath133 is @xmath134.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "if the normalization condition is satisfied , we can get the following equivalent condition , @xmath135 only when @xmath136 , the above integral is convergent , which means that the left - chiral zero mode can be localized on the brane under this condition .    from eq .",

    "note that @xmath53 represents the strength of the contribution from torsion , so the results are applicable only when the torsion have a significant effect .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the geometric effect of torsion on thick branes in gauge theory , and find some analytic domain wall solutions for some specific values of @xmath50 .",
    "we also find that the geometric effect determines whether the domain wall solution is a kink or double - kink . with the increase of the contribution of torsion , the configuration of the solution changes from a kink to double kink .",
    "the more significant the effect is , the more energy dwells on the sub - branes .",
    "we also study the localization of fermion fields on the brane described by the domain wall solution .",
    "it is shown that there is only one bound massless mode on the brane , but when the spacetime torsion has a significant effect , the potential well for the fermion kk modes will become more and more deeper and more resonant states of left - chiral fermions with short lifetime will appear . with the coupling parameter @xmath53 being a function of temperature , the evolution of universe can influence not only the split behavior of the thick brane via changing the contribution from the spacetime torsion , but also the number of fermion resonate states .",

    "<S> in this paper we apply the five - dimensional @xmath0 gravity with @xmath1 to brane scenario to explore the solutions under a given warp factor , and we find that the analytic domain wall solution will be a double - kink solution when the geometric effect of spacetime torsion is strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the localization of fermion fields on the split branes corresponding to the double - kink solution . </S>"
