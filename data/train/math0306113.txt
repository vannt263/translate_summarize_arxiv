    "the ecological model that we introduce in this article is a markov process in which the state at time @xmath0 is given by some configuration @xmath1 .",
    "a site @xmath2 is said to be empty or vacant if @xmath3 , occupied by _",
    "pteridium aquilinum l. _ or bracken if @xmath4 , and occupied by _",
    "fagus sylvatica l. _ or european beech if @xmath5 . if the site @xmath6 is empty , it will be called sometimes a windfall . in what follows",
    ", we will formulate our results in the ecological context .",
    "however , to make the proofs more explicit , we will use another terminology , replacing the brackens by _ red particles _ and the european beeches by _",
    "green particles_. the evolutionary strategies of the two species involved in the competition are quite different and can be described as follows .",
    "the brackens are rhizomatical ferns that colonize their neighboring sites thanks to an underground plexus of rhizomes .",
    "moreover , their optimal development requires sunlight so that they can colonize the windfalls only .",
    "the european beeches produce an important amount of seeds that are spatially dispersed by animals ( zoochory ) and can remain in the soil as seed bank ; the development occurs on the shadow only and so , close to the adult trees or sheltered from the brackens .    with this in mind",
    ", we can now describe the dynamics of the ecological succession .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of neighbors of 0 in @xmath8 given by @xmath9 for some positive integer @xmath10 and some norm @xmath11 on @xmath12 .",
    "a bracken ( resp .",
    "a beech ) standing at @xmath6 tries to give birth to its progeniture on the neighborood @xmath13 at rate @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) .",
    "the new individual is sent to a site chosen at random from the neighboring sites .",
    "if the target site is a windfall , the birth occurs .",
    "otherwise , it is suppressed .",
    "a bracken gives way to a new beech at rate 1 .    finally , a beech lives for an exponentially distributed amount of time with mean 1 and then dies out to give way to a windfall .",
    "for @xmath16 , denote by @xmath17 the proportion of neighbors of @xmath6 occupied in the configuration @xmath18 by a type @xmath19 particle .",
    "then the points 1 and 2 are equivalent to the fact that a windfall becomes occupied by a particle of type @xmath19 at rate @xmath20 .",
    "+ we now formulate our results and construct step by step the phase space of the process in terms of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . first of all , observe that if we start the evolution with a population of european beeches in the absence of brackens , the process we obtain is called the basic contact process with parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we know that , in this case , there exists a critical value @xmath21 such as the following holds .",
    "if @xmath22 then the process converges in distribution to the all empty state , else there exists a stationary measure that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many beeches .",
    "see for instance liggett ( 1999 ) , sect .",
    "+ intuitively , we can think that , on the set where coexistence of both species does not occur , this result goes on holding for the ecological succession model . if @xmath22 , it is obvious , i.e. both species die out or coexist . if we now suppose that @xmath23 , we can prove that starting with infinitely many occupied sites , the process converges in distribution to a stationary measure that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many beeches . to do this , consider two initial configurations @xmath24 and @xmath25 such as @xmath26 if @xmath27 , and @xmath28 otherwise , i.e. @xmath25 can be deduced from @xmath24 by replacing the brackens by beeches . observe that this implies that @xmath29 is the basic contact process with parameter @xmath15 .",
    "then by using a standard argument due to harris ( 1972 ) we may run both processes simultaneously in such a way that if @xmath30 then @xmath31 .",
    "hence , we can finally state the following    [ dichotomie ] starting with infinitely many brackens , the process @xmath32 converges in distribution    1 .",
    "either to the all empty state or to a measure that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many brackens ( and beeches ) if @xmath22 , 2 .   either to the upper invariant measure of the supercritical contact process with parameter @xmath15 or to a measure that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many brackens ( and beeches ) if @xmath23 .    nevertheless , such a coupling fails to prove an analogous result in the case @xmath33 .",
    "but , since the particular dynamics of the ecological succession is inclined to favour the development of the beeches , it looks reasonable to think that , in the case @xmath34 , the beeches take over provided that @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , relying on some technicalities introduced by neuhauser ( 1992 ) , we can prove the two following theorems .",
    "[ diagonale ] we suppose that @xmath34 and @xmath36 is translation invariant .    1 .   if @xmath33 then , starting the evolution with infinitely many beeches , the brackens die out , i.e. @xmath37 the upper invariant measure of the contact process with parameter @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath38 then , starting the evolution with infinitely many occupied sites , @xmath37 . in particular , the beeches take over .",
    "the last step is to show that the ecological succession does not reduce to the basic contact process , i.e. that coexistence of both species occurs for an open set of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . if @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the process is known as the forest fire model .",
    "see for instance durrett and neuhauser ( 1991 ) . in this context ,",
    "0 = alive , 1 = on fire and 2 = burnt .",
    "we start the evolution with one burning tree in a virgin pine forest and follow the spread of the fire .",
    "a burning tree sends out sparks at rate @xmath41 to one of its nearest neighbors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 and burns for an exponentially distributed amount of time with parameter 1 . finally , a new pine regrows spontaneously on the burnt site at rate @xmath46 .",
    "by comparing this particle system with a one - dependent oriented percolation process , durrett and neuhauser ( 1991 ) have proved that , for fixed @xmath46 , there exists a critical value @xmath47 such as the fire has positive probability of not going out if @xmath48 , i.e. there exists a nontrivial stationary distribution . relying on their result and using an idea of schinazi ( 2001 )",
    "we can prove that this goes on holding for the ecological model with small values of @xmath49 .",
    "more precisely , we have the following    [ haut ] we suppose that @xmath40 and that @xmath7 reduces to the nearest neighbors .",
    "if @xmath50 there exists a critical value @xmath51 such as coexistence occurs as soon as @xmath52 , i.e. there exists a stationary distribution that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many brackens .    in conclusion , there exist three possible evolutions of the system to distinct ecological balances . that is , depending on the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the whole population may die out , the beeches may win the competition , and coexistence of both species may occur .",
    "for an picture of the space phase , see fig . 1 . on the other hand",
    ", it looks reasonable to conjecture , in view of the ecological dynamics , that for any @xmath50    1 .",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath53 such as conclusion of theorem [ haut ] holds if and only if @xmath54 .",
    "2 .   the critical value @xmath55 is strictly increasing with respect to @xmath14 .    putting things together , the phase space of the particle system can be divided into three connex components corresponding to the three possible evolutions of the process .",
    ". 2  for a picture .",
    "this also implies that there exists a critical interval @xmath56 such as for any @xmath57 , the three possible evolutions may occur .",
    "in particular , we can notice that for any @xmath57 , an increase of the beeches birth rate @xmath15 can make disappear the brackens and the beeches themselves . in the case",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 , we have observed this phenomenon by simulation for any @xmath50 with @xmath60 . in particular , in view of the special geometry of the one dimensional process , we think that coexistence can not occur in @xmath58 whenever @xmath15 is supercritical .",

    "[ coexistence ] is devoted to the description of results of durrett and neuhauser ( 1991 ) and the proof of theorem [ haut ] .",
    "we begin by constructing the process from a collection of poisson processes in the case @xmath35 . for @xmath6 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be the arrival times of poisson processes with rates @xmath67 and 1 respectively . at times",
    "@xmath68 , we draw an arrow from @xmath6 to @xmath69 , toss a coin with success probability @xmath70 , and , if there is a success , label the arrow with a 2 . if @xmath6 is occupied , @xmath69 is vacant and the arrow is unlabelled , then a birth will occur in @xmath69 .",
    "if the arrow is labelled with a 2 , then the beeches only can give birth through this arrow .",
    "finally , at times @xmath71 , we put a @xmath72 at @xmath6 . in view of the dynamics",
    ", the effect of a @xmath72 is to kill beeches and to permute the brackens into beeches .",
    "a result of harris ( 1972 ) implies that such a graphical representation can be used to construct the process starting from any @xmath73 .",
    "+ we say that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are _ strongly connected _ ,",
    "which we note @xmath76 , if there is a sequence of times @xmath77 and spatial locations @xmath78",
    "so that    1 .   for @xmath79 , there is an arrow from @xmath80 to @xmath81 at time @xmath82 and 2 .   for @xmath83 ,",
    "the vertical segments @xmath84 do not contain any @xmath72 .",
    "if instead of ( 2 ) we have the condition    1 .",
    "the set @xmath85 contains exactly one @xmath72 ,    we say that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are _ weakly connected _ , which we note @xmath86 .",
    "+ after constructing the graphical representation we now define the dual process .",
    "since the @xmath72 do not kill the brackens but convert them into beeches , we must take into account the paths that contain at most one @xmath72 .",
    "so , to construct the dual process , we reverse the arrows and time by mapping @xmath87 , and let @xmath88 since it is in general easier to work with a forward process , we replace @xmath89 by the dual process @xmath90 that is constructed by restoring the direction of time and arrows and by letting @xmath91 as in the basic contact process , @xmath89 and @xmath90 have the same distribution . + before sketching the proof of theorem [ diagonale ] , which is based on the graphical representation , we give some definitions intended to describe the geometry of the dual process .",
    "first of all , note that @xmath92 has a tree structure composed of the points that are either strongly or weakly connected with @xmath93 . to figure on this distinction , denote by @xmath94 the tree formed by the set of points in @xmath95 that are strongly connected  with @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath96 clearly",
    ", the growth of @xmath94 is broken at some points by a @xmath72 from which a new tree takes form so that we obtain the picture of a pyramid of trees connected with @xmath94 by some @xmath72 . in the following",
    ", @xmath94 will be called the _ upper tree starting at _ @xmath93 and the trees starting at a @xmath72 the _ lower trees_. for an illustration , see fig .",
    "3 . to motivate such a breaking up ,",
    "note that , in view of the translation invariance of the graphical representation in space and time , the upper tree and the lower trees are identically distributed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 has obviously the same distribution as the tree structure of the contact process with parameter @xmath15 , that is the set of points in @xmath95 that can be connected by some path to @xmath93 .",
    "see for instance durrett ( 1995 ) , sect",
    ". 3 or liggett ( 1999 ) , sect .",
    "1.1 for a construction of the basic contact process .",
    "so , one of the main interest of our decomposition is that it allows to break up the tree starting at @xmath93 into identically distributed pieces that have some usefull similarities with some well - known structures .",
    "+ now , denote by @xmath97 and @xmath98 the subsets of the dual process given by @xmath99 by analogy with the breaking up of the tree structure in upper tree and lower trees , the elements of @xmath97 and @xmath98 will be respectively called _ upper ancestors _ and _ lower ancestors_. as in the multitype contact process , the tree structure of the dual process @xmath92 allows to define an ancestor hierarchy in which the members are arranged according to the order they determine the color of @xmath93 . here , the special geometry of the dual described above plays a leading role since the color of @xmath93 also depends on the nature of the ancestors .",
    "to specify this idea , we now describe in greater detail the hierarchy .",
    "+ first of all , suppose that @xmath38 .",
    "denote by @xmath100 the @xmath101-th member of the ordered ancestor set and let @xmath102 be the @xmath103-th upper ancestor .",
    "later on , @xmath104 will be called the _ distinguished particle _ , and the first ancestor the _ first particle_. if the first particle  is a upper ancestor that lands on a red particle  ( resp . a green particle ) , then it will paint @xmath93 in red ( resp .",
    "if it is a lower ancestor that lands on a red site , in view of the passage through one @xmath72 , it will bring a green particle  to @xmath93 .",
    "if it is a lower ancestor that lands on a green site , the path taken by the green particle  until it is destroyed by a @xmath72 can prevent the rising of some ancestors toward @xmath93 .",
    "hence , we discard all the ancestors whose path crosses the green particle .",
    "then , we repeat the same procedure with next remaining ancestor , and so on . +    if @xmath105 , the arrows labelled with a 2 are forbidden for the red particles .",
    "so , if @xmath106 does not cross any 2-arrows or lands on a green site or a windfall , we apply the same procedure as before .",
    "if it is a lower ancestor that lands on a red site and that crosses a @xmath72 before the first 2-arrow , it will paint @xmath93 in green .",
    "in the other cases , we follow the path taken by the particle until we first cross a 2-arrow . then we discard all the ancestors of the point where this arrow is attached , and start afresh with the first remaining ancestor , and so on .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "4 , the first particle  and the third ancestor are lower ancestors that land on a green site so they can not paint @xmath93 any color . moreover , the path of the second ancestor is forbidden by the rising of a green particle  at site @xmath107 so that the distinguished particle  @xmath108 paints @xmath93 in red .",
    "if we now suppose that @xmath105 , we can notice that @xmath108 also fails and that the fifth ancestor paints @xmath93 in green .",
    "in this section , we will prove theorem [ diagonale ] for @xmath33 in any dimension .",
    "the strategy of the proof is quite simple ; it relies on a usefull idea of neuhauser ( 1992 ) that consists in breaking up the path of the distinguished particle at certain points into i.i.d",
    "we will first remind this result , describing the intuitive idea on which it is based , and then conclude that the brackens die out as soon as @xmath33 . + to begin with ,",
    "observe that if the upper tree starting at @xmath93 does not live forever then , for @xmath0 large enough , @xmath109 . in particular , in view of the passage of any lower ancestor through one @xmath72 , @xmath93 can not be reached by a red particle  ( see the description of the ancestor hierarchy in sect . [ construction ] ) .",
    "so we can suppose from now on that the upper tree @xmath94 lives forever .",
    "note that the probability of such an event is given by the survival probability of the contact process with parameter @xmath15 starting from one infected site , that is obviously positive since @xmath15 is supercritical . in this case",
    ", we proceed in two steps by firstly checking that the path of the distinguished particle  is forbidden for the red , and then proving that we can bring a green particle  to @xmath93 .",
    "to do this , we define an embedded random walk for the distinguished particle  by breaking its evolution at some points called _ renewal points_. + we now specify this construction .",
    "first of all , denote by @xmath110 , @xmath111 , the jumping times of the distinguished particle .",
    "then , follow the path of the particle inside the upper tree and , whenever it jumps to a new site @xmath112 , look at the branch starting at @xmath113 .",
    "if this branch lives forever , @xmath113 will be called a renewal point .",
    "let @xmath114 be the location of the @xmath101-th renewal .",
    "for an illustration , see fig .",
    "5 . denote by @xmath115 the spatial displacement between consecutive renewal points , and by @xmath116 the corresponding temporal displacement so that @xmath117 our main ingredient to prove theorem [ diagonale ] is given by the following proposition .",
    "we just describe the intuition behind this result . for the details of the proof ,",
    "see neuhauser ( 1992 ) , sect .",
    "2 .    [ random - walk ] if the upper tree lives forever , @xmath118 form an i.i.d . family of random vectors on @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , the tail distributions of @xmath115 and @xmath116 have exponential bounds , i.e. there exist positive constants @xmath119 and @xmath120 such as @xmath121 holds for all @xmath122 .",
    "first of all , denote by @xmath123 the first jumping time of the distinguished particle , that is @xmath124 , by @xmath125 its spatial location after @xmath123 , and by @xmath126 the branch of @xmath94 starting at @xmath127 . for a picture ,",
    "if @xmath126 lives forever then @xmath127 is the first renewal point .",
    "else , we define the sequences @xmath128 and @xmath129 as follows .",
    "if @xmath130 , let @xmath131 be the location of the particle after @xmath132 and @xmath133 the branch starting at @xmath134 .",
    "note that such a branch always exists since we have supposed that @xmath94 lives forever . then denote by @xmath135 the time when @xmath133 dies out .",
    "the sequences are defined until @xmath135 is equal to infinity .",
    "if @xmath136 then @xmath133 lives forever and @xmath134 is the first renewal point of the distinguished particle . to find the next one , we start over again the whole procedure replacing @xmath93 by @xmath134 , and so on",
    "now , look at the path of the particle between time 0 and time @xmath132 . whenever the particle jumps within a new branch @xmath137 , the location of its target site @xmath81 clearly depends on the past history of @xmath94 , that is on the geometry of @xmath94 between 0 and @xmath138 . on the contrary , from time @xmath132",
    ", the particle stays forever inside @xmath133 and its path only depends on this branch so that what happens before and after a renewal point is determined by disjoint parts of @xmath94 .",
    "this implies that the random vectors @xmath139 are independent .",
    "finally , since the graphical gadget is translation invariant in space and time the vectors @xmath139 are also identically distributed .",
    "the proof of the exponential bounds , more technical , can be found in neuhauser ( 1992 ) , sect .",
    "2 .    by proposition",
    "[ random - walk ] , the sequence @xmath114 defines an embedded random walk for the particle .",
    "moreover , the exponential bounds on the displacements @xmath115 and @xmath116 give us control over the location of the particle between consecutive renewal points .",
    "since the branch starting at each renewal grows at most linearly in time , we know that the particle stays within a _ triangle _ whose base contains the following renewal . for a picture , see fig .",
    "+    a triangle is said _ closed for the red _ if the distinguished particle  goes through an arrow labelled with a 2 to cross it . since @xmath33 , the event that a triangle is closed for the red obviously occurs with positive probability .",
    "so , by the borel - cantelli lemma , choosing @xmath0 large enough , we can find arbitrarily many closed triangles .",
    "+    to conclude the proof , we now use the dual process @xmath140 , @xmath141 , starting at @xmath142 and determine the ancestor hierarchy after @xmath0 units of time by going backwards in time .",
    "we construct by induction a sequence of upper ancestors @xmath143 , @xmath111 , that are candidates to bring a green particle  to @xmath142 .",
    "the first member of the sequence is the distinguished particle  @xmath144 .",
    "then , we follow the path the distinguished particle  takes to paint @xmath142 by going forward in time until we first cross a 2-arrow . finally , we look backwards in time starting from the location where this arrow is attached and discard all the offspring of this point ( that is the next few members of the ordered ancestor set ) and all the ancestors that land at time 0 on the same site as the distinguished particle .",
    "the second member of the sequence is then the first upper ancestor that is left .",
    "we repeat the procedure with this ancestor , and so on until we run out of upper ancestors . now , denote by @xmath145 the set of members of the sequence and by @xmath146 the set of sites occupied at time @xmath147 by a green particle .",
    "since the tree @xmath94 is linearly growing in time , we can make the cardinality of @xmath145 arbitrarily large by choosing @xmath0 large enough .",
    "in particular , given @xmath148 and @xmath149 there exists a time @xmath150 so that @xmath151 for any @xmath152 . by lemma 9.14 of harris ( 1976 ) , this together with the translation invariance of @xmath36 and the fact that @xmath153 with positive probability , imply that @xmath154 hence , for @xmath0 large enough , at least one candidate lands on a green site .",
    "now , consider the first member of the sequence @xmath143 that lands on a site occupied by a green particle  and follow the path of this particle by going forward in time .",
    "then , whenever it crosses an arrow , its target site is either empty or already occupied by a green particle  ( resulting from the passage of a red particle  through the first @xmath72 located under the arrowhead ) .",
