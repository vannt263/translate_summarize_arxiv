    "the analysis of acoustical signals and visual images in terms of wavelet transformations is a ` multi - resolution analysis ' ; as such , it purports at providing a solution to time - frequency localisation considerations arising in the standard ` short - time fourier transformation ' ( stft ) , namely to the deterioration of the frequency resolution in compactly supported ( i.e. , associated with narrow time windows ) stft analyses .",
    "a wavelet - based analysis ( wba ) probes the input signal at various scale levels , analogous to the frequency levels in the standard fourier - based analysis ( fba ) , matching the resolution requirements associated with each such level .",
    "the involvement of the wavelet transformations in understanding the cochlear response to external stimuli was proposed in the early 1990s @xcite .",
    "the relevance of such an analysis in this subject appertains to the near fulfillment of the local scaling symmetry , under which the cochlear filter is a function of one variable , i.e. , of the ratio of the input angular frequency @xmath5 to the tonotopic axis , which associates positions along the basilar membrane of the cochlea with frequencies @xcite . known as zweig s postulate",
    ", this property had been established in von bksy s early experiments @xcite , which demonstrated that the graphs of the cochlear filter at two ( different ) frequencies are translated against one another by a constant term involving the logarithm of the ratio of the two frequencies . given the potential for commercial applications ,",
    "it is hardly surprising that aspects of this mathematical subject have been patented @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the family of wavelets , which have been put forth as suitable candidates for the processing of acoustical signals , was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of theoretical principles and of the time - frequency localisation constraints .",
    "herein , each such wavelet is called a ` reimann wavelet ' .",
    "the goal in this paper is to show that the wavelet transformations , emerging from this family , establish a promising theoretical basis for the processing of acoustical signals .",
    "if successful in this task , the possibility arises of using these wavelet forms in commercial applications , even to the extent of replacing the fourier transformation upon which the processing of acoustical signals predominantly relies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .    * in section [",
    "sec : method ] , the relevant definitions are given and the mathematical background , required in the processing of acoustical signals , is developed .",

    "subsection [ sec : sere ] explores specific properties of the transforms , obtained with the family of the reimann wavelets , in particular regarding the ` structure equations ' , i.e. , relations which these transforms obey ; the last part of the subsection investigates the incorporation of the re - assignment method in the analysis , aiming at providing solutions to two problems : to the determination of the important contributions of the wavelet transforms and to the development of an efficient noise - suppression scheme . * in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , the results of the application of the theoretical background of section [ sec : method ] are discussed .",

    "however , in order to compare wavelet forms and transforms obtained with different parameter sets , the wavelets need to be properly normalised .",

    "evidently , the choice of the settings involves a trade - off between the quality of the reproduction , the memory requirements , and the runtime demands ; as such , it must reflect the placement of the emphasis in a study .",
    "for instance , when investigating the optimal parameter values of the reimann wavelets , memory and speed are not relevant . on the contrary , in real - time processing of acoustical data , memory and speed are paramount ; in order to obtain fast results in such applications ( and avoid undue delays ) , the expectations on quality must be somewhat curtailed .      for the determination of optimal parameter values",

    "it is evident that the minimal delay ( difference between the time at which a sound - wave measurement is captured and that at which the corresponding output becomes available ) is equal to @xmath193 ms ( at best ) .",
    "( to achieve minimal delay values , @xmath176 is chosen as large as possible . however",
    ", this has drawbacks in real - time applications , as it stretches the runtime load . ) in any case , the point is that regardless of whether the analysis of an acoustical signal is fourier- or wavelet - based , @xmath145 measurements are _ simultaneously _ submitted for processing , the central @xmath146 values of which comprise the output at the particular window position . as a result , it is not clear whether and how causality enters the analysis , and whether the wavelets need to be causal .",
    "the issue of causality has not been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in spite of the fact that the reproduction of the data is hardly affected",
    ", we will assume the cautious attitude of considering only causal wavelets herein , i.e. , mother wavelets with suppressed positive support  .",
    "after scanning the parameter space , it appeared that one good starting point , to be used as ` initial guess ' in the optimisation scheme , was : @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 ( as mentioned earlier , the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are fixed to @xmath39 ) .",
    "on the way to extract optimal parameter values from a data set , regardless of the domain of application , three are the main issues : a ) the quantification of a qualitative concept such as the ` goodness of the description of the data ' , b ) the method which is employed for obtaining the optimal parameter values , and c ) the data on the basis of which the determination is made .",
    "these three points will be addressed next .",
    "the statistical measure of the quality of the data description is the linear ( pearson s ) correlation coefficient @xmath198 between the input and the output values . for arrays obeying an ideal linear relation , @xmath199 ( or @xmath200 in case of an ideal anti - correlation , which is not of relevance herein ) ;",

    "we now describe the method of extracting the optimal parameter values .",
    "commencing from the parameters pertaining to the initial guess , a three - step approach was followed .",
    "a ) each parameter was set to three values : the one corresponding to the aforementioned initial vector in the parameter space ( central value ) and the two values defined at @xmath202 of the central value . in case that the @xmath198 value was largest for the central element , a quadratic fit yielded the candidate optimal value , which was either accepted ( if the @xmath198 value at the new setting exceeded the one which had been previously obtained for the central element ) or rejected ( in which case , the central element was used as the optimal setting ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the central value of the parameter did not yield the largest @xmath198 value , the parameter was varied in the direction of maximising @xmath198 ( always using the maximal step of @xmath203 of the starting value ) , until three values were found for which the central one yielded the largest @xmath198 ( in other words , the procedure was interrupted at the moment when the @xmath198 maximum was bracketed ) ; a new quadratic fit determined the candidate optimal value , which was either accepted or rejected ( by applying the aforementioned criterion ) .",
    "the parameters were treated serially , in the order : @xmath34 , @xmath77 , @xmath33 , and @xmath24 ; this order was obtained on the basis of decreasing importance in regard to changes induced on the resulting wavelet ( determined via a simple variational analysis around the parameter - space point corresponding to the initial guess ) .",
    "b ) step ( a ) was repeated , with @xmath204 ( instead of @xmath203 ) steps for each parameter , and using the final result of step ( a ) as the initial parameter vector .",
    "c ) step ( a ) was repeated , with @xmath205 steps for each parameter , and using the final result of step ( b ) as the initial parameter vector .",
    "all the steps above involved only causal wavelets ; if a non - causal wavelet was suggested at any point in the procedure just outlined , that wavelet was replaced by a close - by ( within the ` current ' interval of variation of the particular parameter ) causal neighbour ( randomly selected ) .",
    "the important results for the fitted parameters and for @xmath198 are shown in table [ tab : optparval ] .",
