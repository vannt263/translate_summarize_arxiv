    "neutron star matter equation of state ( ns - eos ) including hyperons is one of the most interesting current subjects in nuclear physics as well as in astrophysics .",
    "hyperons are expected to emerge as the substitutes of nucleons to reduce the fermi energy in @xmath4-equilibrium dense matter , and ns - eos is strongly affected by the properties of baryon - baryon interactions  @xcite : hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) , hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath6 ) and nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) interactions .",
    "since hyperon lifetimes are too short to determine @xmath5 and @xmath6 interactions precisely via scattering experiments , we have to deduce information on these interactions through experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite investigations of hypernuclei which include one or more @xmath8 , @xmath0 and @xmath9 hyperons .",
    "ns - eoss including hyperons have been proposed so far by taking experimental hypernuclear data into account ; they generally predict maximum masses of neutron stars in the range @xmath10 .",
    "recent discoveries of the two - solar - mass neutron stars  @xcite have cast doubt on these eoss .",
    "the observation is based on the shapiro - delay , a consequence of the general relativity , and the signal is clearly seen owing to the fortunate inclination angle ( @xmath11 ) . from this observation , it is concluded that typical ns - eoss with hyperons or boson condensates are ruled out .",
    "it is a big challenge to construct ns - eos which is consistent with hypernuclear physics results and supports the two - solar - mass neutron star .    in solving the two - solar - mass ns puzzle mentioned above , there are two key ingredients : constraining @xmath5 and @xmath6 interactions and understanding the origin of repulsive interactions at high density . among @xmath5 interactions ,",
    "@xmath12 interaction is relatively well - known including its spin dependence , and we here concentrate on the @xmath13 interaction . since @xmath1 is the lightest among the negatively - charged baryons , its appearance is favored in neutron stars because of the charge chemical potential and the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "for example , glendenning suggested that @xmath1 would appear at @xmath14 in neutron star matter in a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) framework  @xcite , where @xmath0 potential in nuclear matter was considered to be similar to that of @xmath8 , @xmath15 .",
    "later on , @xmath0 potential in symmetric nuclear matter is suggested to be repulsive from @xmath1 atomic shift data  @xcite , and is confirmed to be repulsive in the quasi - free @xmath1 production data  @xcite . the @xmath13 repulsion",
    "is explained naturally as a consequence of the quark pauli blocking in quark models  @xcite . in neutron star matter ,",
    "balberg and gal pointed out that baryon composition is sensitive to the choice of the @xmath13 interaction  @xcite , and similar conclusions are obtained in rmf approaches  @xcite .",
    "now it is commonly understood that the isoscalar part of the @xmath0 potential is so repulsive that @xmath0 hyperons tend to be suppressed in ns matter , while we still have ambiguities in the isovector part of the @xmath0 potential .",
    "typical isovector coupling of @xmath0 in rmf is twice that of the nucleons , @xmath16 , owing to the isospin of @xmath0 , @xmath17 .",
    "atomic shift data of @xmath1 atoms , however , suggest much smaller isovector coupling . from the si and pb @xmath1 atomic shifts , mares , friedman , gal and jennings obtained the coupling ratio @xmath18  @xcite .    in our previous work",
    ", we obtained a further smaller ratio , @xmath19 , in an rmf model with a logarithmic chiral potential motivated by the strong coupling limit of lattice qcd  @xcite and @xmath20 mixing effects from u@xmath21 anomaly  @xcite . in this rmf model ,",
    "abbreviated as scl3 , most of the coupling constants have been constrained by the flavor su@xmath22 ( su@xmath3 ) symmetry for the vector couplings and experimental data of nuclear matter , normal and @xmath8 hypernuclei and @xmath0 atom data .",
    "one exception is the @xmath23-@xmath0 coupling ; in order to reproduce atomic shift data of @xmath1 atoms , we need to modify @xmath2 from the su@xmath3-constrained value .",
    "smaller @xmath24 ratio leads to a less repulsive potential of @xmath1 in neutron star matter , and @xmath1 is found to appear in neutron stars even though the isoscalar part of the @xmath0 potential is repulsive .",
    "the above conclusion , @xmath1 would appear in neutron stars with smaller isovector coupling fitting the atomic shifts , may be model dependent , and should be confirmed with other rmf model parameters .    another important aspect for the two - solar - mass ns puzzle is the origin of the repulsion at high density .",
    "it is well - known that with the non - relativistic effective interaction derived from the bare two - body @xmath7 interaction ( g - matrix ) , the saturation point depends on the strength of the tensor interaction and forms a so - called `` coester line '' , which is off the empirical saturation point .",
    "when we include phenomenological three - nucleon repulsion together with the three - body attraction with @xmath25 in the intermediate state , it becomes possible to explain the saturation point and to support two - solar - mass nss .",
    "the above three - nucleon interactions are , however , not enough to support heavy neutron stars , when hyperons are included  @xcite ; the calculated maximum mass of neutron stars with hyperons  @xcite is less than the precisely measured mass of the hulse - taylor pulsar , @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we need to introduce three - baryon repulsion , which also acts in @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels  @xcite . in a relativistic framework ,",
    "three - body repulsion appears naturally from relativistic kinematics .",
    "the attraction from the scalar field appears as the mass reduction , and its effects are relatively smaller at high densities compared with the repulsion from the vector field . as a result , the relativistic brckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) theory can reproduce the saturation point  @xcite , and rmf models generally predict large maximum masses of nss",
    ". this relativistic repulsion could be enough to explain @xmath30 , but it is not sufficient to describe the newly discovered two - solar - mass nss when hyperons are taken into account .",
    "we need to introduce extra repulsion at high densities also in relativistic frameworks .",
    "one of the mechanisms to get extra repulsion in hyperonic matter is to introduce three - baryon interaction  @xcite .",
    "another way may be to introduce repulsive interaction having different flavor dependence from that adopted in current treatments .",
    "the atomic shift fit of @xmath1 atoms leads to the modification of hyperon - meson couplings and is related to the second way .    in this article",
    ", we revisit @xmath0 hyperons in rmf models and discuss the possibility of @xmath1 admixture in neutron star matter .",
    "we compare the results of several rmf models with non - linear meson self - energies , where hyperon - meson couplings are determined by reproducing known hypernuclear data .",
    "especially , we examine whether @xmath1 should emerge in ns medium when we adopt the parameter sets which can explain the observed @xmath1 atomic shifts .",
    "finally , we investigate the maximum mass of ns with ns - eos constrained by the hypernuclear and exotic atom physics requirements .",
    "rmf models are successful in describing various properties of normal nuclei with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath23 mesons which couple with nucleons .",

    ", differences in non - linear terms give rise to large ambiguities in dense matter eos .",
    "thus it would be possible to discriminate these rmf models for normal nuclei by including hyperons and applying them to ns - eos .",

    "a simple extension is to include hyperons in the baryon sum in eq .",

    "unfortunately , it is so time - consuming and sometimes meaningless to vary each coupling constant independently since only their balance can affect the calculated numerical properties .",
    "thus , there are mainly two types of prescriptions to constrain meson - hyperon coupling sets",
    ". one of them is based on the picture where we regard the mesons in rmf models are made of @xmath60 . then the hyperon - meson couplings are constrained by symmetries of quarks . the other",

    "this trend is already suggested in our previous work using scl3 rmf .",
    "thus , we confirm that it is common to all employed rmf models here and scl3 rmf model that @xmath8 and @xmath1 appear almost simultaneously at around 2 - 3 @xmath134 if we apply the parameter sets reproducing @xmath1 atomic shifts , as shown in fig .",

    "have already been softened strongly by the emergence of @xmath8 hyperon , and the softening effect of @xmath1 on ns maximum mass is not very strong . in nl1 and nl - sh ,",
    "calculated maximum masses of ns exceed 2@xmath135 even if @xmath8 and @xmath0 hyperons are included , and the recently observed heavy ns  @xcite can be supported . by comparison ,",
    "the calculated ns maximum mass in tm1 with hyperons does not reach 2@xmath135 , and the two - solar - mass ns puzzle remains .",
    "it would be premature to conclude that the two - solar - mass ns puzzle can be solved in nl1 and nl - sh rmf models with as fit values of @xmath2 .",
    "it seems that the high density region in ns core may be out of the range of applicability in the present treatment of nl1 and nl - sh parameter sets with hyperons ; the effective mass of nucleon is reduced too much and it becomes negative at around 4@xmath121 and 6.5@xmath134 , respectively .",
    "the mechanism of the negative nucleon effective mass can be understood as follows .",
    "both nucleons and hyperons act to increase @xmath31 as long as their effective mass is positive . at the density",
    "where nucleon effective mass vanishes , hyperons are still massive due to the smaller couplings with @xmath31 and larger masses in vacuum .",
    "these huge mass reductions may correspond to the phase transition from a baryonic matter to a quark matter since they indicate the complete restoration of chiral symmetry .    by comparison ,",
    "tm1 parameter set is free from the negative nucleon mass problem in the density region considered here , but its maximum mass lies below the observed @xmath136 ; maximum mass of ns in tm1 with hyperons is calculated to be 1.75@xmath135 . in tm1 ,",
    "the @xmath137 self - interaction is introduced so as to simulate the scalar and vector potentials in dirac - brckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculation  @xcite .",
    "we have also adopted this @xmath137 self - interaction in scl2 and scl3 models .",

    "since nl rmf models do not include @xmath137 terms , vector repulsive potentials linearly increase at higher @xmath79 as we presented in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "different predictions in the rmf models discussed here implies the importance of three - body interactions  @xcite .",
    "higher order meson interaction terms such as @xmath139 and @xmath137 may be related to the three - body interactions .",
    "these interactions are expected to lead not only re - stiffening effect in eos but also the suppression to the appearance of hyperons .",
    "we introduced explicit three - body couplings to rmf model and examined their effects to high density ns - eos with preliminary parameter sets which are determined in the same way as we have reported in this work  @xcite .",
    "more detail analysis is strongly needed to give a conclusion of the validity of three - body couplings .",
    "in this article , we have investigated neutron star matter equation of state ( ns - eos ) based on the rmf models which can reproduce the bulk properties of nuclear systems consisting of nucleons and hypernulcear systems consisting of @xmath8 and @xmath0 hyperons in addition to nucleons .",
    "we have emphasized the importance of @xmath0 coupling with isovector - vector ( @xmath23 ) meson , @xmath2 .",
    "the coupling constants of @xmath8 and @xmath0 hyperons in rmf models have been well - constrained by explaining separation energies of @xmath8 ( @xmath75 ) in single @xmath8 hypernuclei , @xmath70 bond energy ( @xmath76 ) in the double @xmath8 hypernucleus @xmath77 , and the @xmath1 atomic shifts , under the assumption that the isoscalar vector couplings are fixed by the su@xmath3  symmetric coupling constant relations .",
    "we have found that we need to reduce @xmath2 from the su@xmath3  value to explain the experimental @xmath1 atomic shifts .",
    "then the symmetry energy of @xmath0 in the atomic shift fit case is smaller than that in the su@xmath3  case .",
    "we have examined the hyperon effects on the ns - eos by using the rmf including hyperons with as fit and su@xmath3  values of @xmath2 .",
    "we have confirmed that @xmath1 would appear in ns matter with the as fit @xmath2 value , since the isovector part of @xmath1 potential in ns matter is smaller in the as fit case than in the su@xmath3  case .",
    "this trend is common to all of employed rmf parameter sets , nl1 , nl - sh , tm1 and scl2 with as fit values . @xmath1",
    "hyperons can appear in ns matter at @xmath140 , which is close to the density where @xmath8 hyperons appear .",
    "thus , it is valuable to revisit the appearance of @xmath1 in ns matter , when we want to understand ns based on experimental hypernuclear data including @xmath1 atomic shifts .",
    "ns - eos is softened by @xmath8 and @xmath0 hyperons .",
    "the ns maximum mass is reduced by @xmath141 when we include @xmath8 , and it is further reduced by including @xmath0 slightly .",
    "when we include hyperons in ns - eos , tm1 rmf model can not support @xmath142 ns  @xcite , while nl1 and nl - sh could support 2@xmath135 ns mass .",
    "we need more studies to solve the heavy neutron star puzzle conclusively . in nl1 and nl - sh models ,",
    "nucleon effective mass becomes negative at medium baryon density , and we can not explain the density dependence of the vector potential obtained in the dirac - brckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculation . in tm1 , scl2 , and scl3 models , @xmath137 self - interaction is included to simulate the dbhf results , but these models can not support the 2@xmath135 ns .    it was also suggested that @xmath143-nucleus potential is attractive from the analysis about @xmath143 production spectrum  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath9 hyperons emerge in dense matter , ns - eos will be softened a little more as in the @xmath1 case .",
    "we guess , however , that maximum mass will not be affected by inclusion of @xmath143 so much since , as we have shown , ns - eos has already been softened by including @xmath8 hyperon and @xmath1 reduce the electron chemical potential .    from these results",
    ", we conclude that re - stiffening mechanisms are required to understand the massive ns properties . as one of candidate to solve this problem , three - body repulsive interactions are suggested to be considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite , universal three - baryon repulsive interactions were examined .",
    "these interactions are expected to lead not only re - stiffening effect but also the suppression to the appearance of @xmath8 , @xmath0 and @xmath9 hyperons .",
