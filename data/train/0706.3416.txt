    "the capacity of the lossy bosonic channel was found in @xcite , where it was shown that a modulation scheme using classical light ( coherent states ) suffices to achieve ultimate communication rates over this channel .",
    "subsequent attempts to evaluate the capacity of the lossy bosonic channel with additive gaussian noise @xcite led to a crucial conjecture on the minimum output entropy of a class of bosonic channels @xcite . proving that conjecture would complete the capacity proof for the bosonic channel with additive gaussian noise , and it would show that this channel s capacity is achievable with classical - light modulation . more recent work that addressed bosonic multiple - access communication channels @xcite revealed that modulation of information using non - classical states of light is necessary to achieve ultimate single - user rates in the multiple - access scenario .",

    "thus , under these coding and detection assumptions , the capacity region of the bosonic broadcast channel is dual to that of the multiple - access bosonic channel with coherent - state encoding and coherent detection . to treat more general transmitter and receiver conditions",
    ", we use a limiting argument to apply the degraded quantum broadcast - channel coding theorem for finite - dimensional state spaces @xcite to the infinite - dimensional bosonic channel with an average photon - number constraint .",
    "we consider the two - receiver case in which alice ( @xmath0 ) simultaneously transmits to bob ( @xmath1 ) , via the transmissivity @xmath2 port of a lossless beam splitter , and to charlie ( @xmath3 ) , via that beam splitter s reflectivity @xmath4 port , using arbitrary encoding and optimum measurement with an average photon number @xmath5 at the input .",
    "given a new conjecture about the minimum output entropy of a lossy bosonic channel , we show that the ultimate capacity region is achieved by coherent - state encoding , and is given by @xmath6 for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the von neumann entropy of the bose - einstein distribution with mean @xmath9 .",
