    "although their construction is explicit , the pages of the resulting open books arise as seifert surfaces of torus knots or links , and so this algorithm is far from even approximating the numbers @xmath4 . in @xcite ,",
    "the same algorithm was generalized to the case where @xmath3 need not to be stein fillable ( or even tight ) , but the pages are still of large genera .",
    "this article is organized as follows : after the preliminaries ( section [ preliminaries ] ) , in section [ algorithm ] we will present an explicit construction of a supporting open book ( with considerably less genus ) for a given contact surgery diagram of any contact structure @xmath3 .",
    "of course , because of theorem [ sg=0ifovertwisted ] , our algorithm makes more sense for the tight structures than the overtwisted ones .",
    "moreover , it depends on a choice of the contact surgery diagram describing @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , it gives better and more reasonable upper bound for @xmath4 ( when @xmath3 is tight ) as we will see from our examples in section [ examples ] .",
