    "inverse heat source problems appear in many branches of engineering and science .",
    "a typical application is for instance an accurate estimation of a pollutant source , which is a crucial environmental safeguard in cities with dense populations ( e.g. for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these inverse problems are severely ill - posed , involving a strongly time - irreversible parabolic dynamics .",
    "their mathematical analysis is difficult and still a widely open subject .    in the present work ,",
    "we are concerned with sources located at the initial time .      in an earlier paper gilliam and",
    "martin @xcite considered the problem of recovering the initial data of the heat equation when the output is measured at points discrete in time and space .",
    "they observed that this problem is linked to the theory of dirichlet series and a solution is found in the one dimensional case .",
    "in @xcite , gilliam , lund and martin provide a simple and extremely accurate procedure for approximating the initial temperature for the heat equation on the line using a discrete time and spatial sampling .",
    "this procedure in based on `` sinc expansion '' .",
    "later , in @xcite , the same authors give a discrete sampling scheme for the approximate recovery of initial data for one dimensional parabolic initial - boundary value problems on bounded interval .",
    "the problem of recovering the initial states of distributed parameter systems , governed by linear partial differential equations , from finite approximate data , was studied by gilliam , mair and martin in @xcite .",
    "li , osher and tsai considered in @xcite the inverse problem of finding sparse initial data from the sparsely sampled solutions of the heat equation .",
    "they prove that pointwise values of the heat solution at only a few locations are enough in an @xmath0 constrained optimization to find the initial data .    in a recent work ,",
    "de vore and zuazua @xcite studied the problem of approximating accurately the initial data if the one - dimensional dirichlet problem from finite measurements made at @xmath1 .",
    "they proved that , for suitable choices of the point location of the sensor , @xmath2 , there is a sequence @xmath3 of time instants that guarantees the approximation with an optimal rate , of the order of @xmath4 in the @xmath5-sense , depending on the sobolev regularity of the datum being recovered .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the orthogonality method in @xcite leads to a best approximation in space , while in @xcite the authors show a best approximation in time .",
    "the determination of the initial distribution in the heat equation on a flat torus of arbitrary dimension was considered by danger , foote and martin @xcite .",
    "they established that the observation of the solution along a geodesic determines uniquely the initial heat distribution if and only if the geodesic is dense in the torus .",
    "their result was obtained by using a fourier decomposition together with results from the theory of almost periodic functions .",
    "similar ideas were independently employed in @xcite in the context of the approximate controllability and unique continuation for the heat equation along oscillating sensor and actuator locations .",
    "let @xmath6 be the solution of the heat equation in the whole space @xmath7 .",
    "nakamura , saitoh and syarif @xcite showed that the initial distribution is determined and simply represented by the observations @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , for some fixed @xmath12 .    to our knowledge",
    "there are only few works dealing with the stability issue . in a series of papers by saitoh and al .",
    "@xcite , based on reznitskaya transform and some properties of bergman - selberg spaces , they obtained lipschitz stability estimate from a point or a boundary observation .",
    "we consider the initial - boundary value problem , abbreviated to ibvp in the sequel , for the one dimensional heat equation @xmath13 it has a unique solution @xmath14 whenever @xmath15 .",
    "this solution can be written in term of fourier series as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th fourier coefficient of @xmath19 : @xmath20    given a point @xmath21 for the placement of the sensor , we address the question of reconstructing the initial distribution @xmath19 from @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in light of , setting @xmath24 , we see that the actual problem is reduced to one of recovering the sequence @xmath25 from the sum of the corresponding dirichlet series @xmath26 for this to be the case @xmath2 has to be chosen in a strategic way so that @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath31 is a strictly increasing sequence of non negative real numbers , converging to infinity .",
    "the behavior of this problem depends on whether the series @xmath32 converges .",
    "* when @xmath32 converges , @xmath33 admits a biorthogonal family and this simplifies the analysis .",
    "* the case @xmath34 is much harder and the stability estimates we obtain are weaker .    in both cases ,",
    "we prove stability estimate of logarithmic or hlder type and to carry out our analysis we need to compare @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 is given .",
    "in the case @xmath34 , a gap condition on the sequence @xmath31 is also necessary in our analysis ( see in subsection [ sb2.2 ] ) .    in section 3 ,",
    "we apply the results obtained in the section 2 to the problem of determining the initial heat distribution in a one dimensional heat equation from an overspecified data .",
    "we get a various stability estimates of hlder or logarithmic type .",
    "our results include fractional heat equations of any order .",
    "we also establish a boundary observability inequality with an output located at one of the end points .",
    "this later enables us to obtain a logarithmic stability estimate for the inverse problem of recovering the initial condition from a boundary measurement .    in section 4 ,",
    "we first consider the particular case of the ( fractional ) heat equation in a d - dimensional rectangle @xmath38 .",
    "we show that if the dirichlet eigenvalues of the laplacian in @xmath38 are simple . ] , then , in some cases , the determination of the initial heat distribution can be reduced to the one dimensional case .",
    "this is achieved when the measurements consist in the values of the solution of the heat equation on @xmath39 affine @xmath40-dimensional subspaces .",
    "next , we revisit the case when overdetermined data is an internal or a boundary observation .",
