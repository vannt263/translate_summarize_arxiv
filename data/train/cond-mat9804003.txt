    "simple ed algorithms update the whole system after each event , a method which is straightforward , but inefficient for large numbers of particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite an ed algorithm was introduced which updates only those two particles which were involved in the last collision . for this a double buffering data structure is implemented , which contains the ` old ' status and the ` new ' status , each consisting of : time of event , position , velocities , and event - partner .",
    "when a collision occurs , the ` old ' and ` new ' status of the participating particles are exchanged .",
    "thus , the former ` new ' status becomes the actual ` old ' one , while the former ` old ' status becomes the ` new ' one and is free for future calculations .",
    "this seemingly complicated exchange from information is carried out extremely simple and fast by only exchanging the pointers to the ` new ' and ` old ' status respectively .",
    "the ` old ' status of particle @xmath229 has to be kept in memory , in order to calculate the time of the next contact , @xmath117 , of particle @xmath229 with any other object @xmath230 which can change its status due to a collision with yet another particle . during the simulation",

    "this would be a waste of computer time , since before the time @xmath117 , the predicted partners @xmath229 and @xmath230 might be involved into several collisions with other particles , so that we apply a delayed update scheme @xcite .",
    "the minimum times of event , i.e. the times which indicate the next event for a certain particle , are stored in an ordered heap tree , such that the next event is found at the top of the heap with computational effort of @xmath234 ; changing the position of one particle in the tree from the top to a new position needs @xmath235 operations .",
    "the search for possible collision partners is accelerated by the use of a standard linked - cell data structure and consumes @xmath236 of numerical ressources . in total , this results in numerical effort of @xmath237 for @xmath2 particles . for a detailed description of the algorithm see ref .",
