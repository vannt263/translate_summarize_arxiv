    "the pseudospin symmetry has been used to explain a number of phenomena in nuclear structure.@xcite in order to understand the origin of pseudospin symmetry , we need to take into account the motion of the nucleons in a relativistic mean field and thus consider the dirac equation.@xcite the cases in which the mean field is composed by a vector ( @xmath0 ) and a scalar ( @xmath1 ) potential , with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , are usually pointed out as a necessary condition for occurrence of pseudospin ( spin ) symmetry in nuclei.@xcite furthermore , with an appropriate choice of signs , potentials fulfilling the relations @xmath4 are able to bind either fermions or antifermions.@xcite moreover , in the nucleus , the charge - conjugation transformation relates the spin symmetry of the negative bound - state solutions ( antinucleons ) to the pseudospin symmetry of the positive bound - state solutions ( nucleons).@xcite in addition , a link of the pseudospin to chiral symmetry has been suggested.@xcite the main motivation of this article is to shed some light in the relation between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of charge - conjugation and chiral transformations in 1 + 1 dimensions . to do so , we solve the mixed scalar - vector - pseudoscalar pschl - teller potential in 1 + 1 dimensions , taking advantage of the simplicity of the lowest dimensionality of the space - time as much as was done for the harmonic oscillator.castro",
    "the 1 + 1 dimensional time - independent dirac equation for a fermion of rest mass @xmath5 under the action of vector ( @xmath6 ) , scalar ( @xmath7 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath8 ) potentials can be written , in terms of the combinations @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the pauli matrices .    the _ charge - conjugation operation _",
    "is accomplished by the transformation @xmath14 and the dirac equation becomes @xmath15 , with @xmath16    the chiral operator for a dirac spinor is the matrix @xmath17 . under the _ discrete chiral transformation _ the spinor is transformed as @xmath18 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath19 is    @xmath20    we have two first - order equations for the upper , @xmath21 , and the lower , @xmath22 , components of the spinor : @xmath23@xmath24 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath25 .    for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",

    "thus , either for @xmath26 with @xmath27 or @xmath38 with @xmath39 the solution of the relativistic problem is mapped into a sturm - liouville problem in such a way that solutions can be found by solving a schrdinger - like problem .",
    "the solutions for @xmath26 with @xmath40 and @xmath38 with @xmath41 , excluded from the sturm - liouville problem , are obtained directly from the original first - order equations .",
    "let us consider    @xmath42    due to the chiral symmetry one can restrict the discussion to the @xmath43 case ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the results for the case when @xmath44 , @xmath32 , @xmath45 are obtained by changing the sign of @xmath5 and of @xmath46 in the relevant expressions .",

    "if we compare that figure with fig . 1 ( left ) ( @xmath58 )",
    "we see that the plots are identical if we reverse both the vertical and horizontal axes , i.e , if we reverse the sign of the energy and of @xmath46 concomitantly . of course , the identification of particle and antiparticle levels is also reversed , as it should be , because we are applying the charge - conjugation transformation .",
    "all of that implies into the possibility of bounded states with both positive- and negative - energy solutions in a system with @xmath38 , that can be relevant for nuclei .",
    "finally we stress that the chiral transformation enables us to switch between the so - called pseudospin ( @xmath32 and @xmath67 ) and spin symmetries ( @xmath68 and @xmath67 ) _ for any potential _ and , for massless fermions , it shows that the @xmath26 and @xmath32 solutions have the same spectrum .",
