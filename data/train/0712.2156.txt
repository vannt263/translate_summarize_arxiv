    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) represents the most popular approach towards a solution of the hierarchy problem , with the added virtue of being perturbative and accounting for the unification of the gauge coupling constants and the possibility of eventually including gravity  @xcite .",
    "little is currently known about the detailed mechanism of how susy is realized and of how it is broken .",
    "ultimately only experiment can settle this issue .",
    "the most popular ansatz _ assumes _ that r ",
    "parity is conserved and that susy breaking in a hidden sector is communicated to the observable sector by flavour - blind gravitational interactions .",
    "neither of these assumptions is mandatory , in fact they are both _",
    "ad hoc_. many different mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking can be envisaged  @xcite and , similarly , the breaking of r  parity  @xcite can take place in a variety of ways  @xcite .    here",
    "we will adopt only the first part of the conventional ansatz , namely assume transmission of supersymmetry breaking via gravity but relax the r ",
    "parity conservation assumption .",
    "a specially interesting possibility is that r ",
    "parity breaks spontaneously , as a result of the minimization of the scalar higgs potential  @xcite , very much in the same way as the electroweak symmetry itself breaks .",
    "spontaneous r - parity breaking models are characterized by two types of sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vev )  , those of right and left - handed sneutrinos , singlets and doublets under 21 respectively , obeying the `` vev - seesaw '' relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the small yukawa coupling that governs the strength of r  parity violation  @xcite . below the scale @xmath3 the effective breaking of r ",
    "parity is explicit through bilinear superpotential terms and the corresponding soft supersymmetry breaking terms . for generality and simplicity here",
    "we replace the right - handed sneutrino @xmath3 vev by the effective bilinear coupling .",
    "we refer to such simple effective bilinear r  parity breaking ( brpv ) picture as brpv ",
    "msugra for short  @xcite  @xcite . here",
    "we start directly from the brpv  msugra model , which has a strong phenomenological motivation , besides simplicity , namely that it provides the most economical effective model for supersymmetric neutrino masses , that successfully accounts for the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixings  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that , despite the smallness of r  parity violation indicated by the neutrino oscillation data , its effects can be tested and the model falsified at collider experiments  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the implications of the model for the first stages of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "there have been extensive studies of searches for supersymmetric particles but mainly in the context of models with conserved r parity  @xcite .",
    "so far no direct experimental evidence for susy in high energy experiments has been found . with the coming into operation of the lhc searches for r ",
    "parity breaking signatures  @xcite acquire stronger motivation not only by their intrinsic interest , but also because they open the exciting possibility of probing the neutrino oscillation angles at collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "previously we have studied the tevatron potential to search for brpv  msugra in the multilepton channel  @xcite as well as in the form of displaced vertices  @xcite . in this work",
    "we provide a quantitative analysis of the phenomenological implications of bilinear r ",
    "parity breaking supergravity for the lhc , extending our studies to the new energy range accessible at the lhc and including all constraints from neutrino oscillation physics . since the effective strength of r ",
    "parity violation must be small in order to fit current neutrino oscillation data , our study also constitutes a robustness check of the supergravity parameter reach estimates against the presence of `` perturbative '' brpv terms .",
    "supersymmetric particle spectra and production cross sections are expected to be the same as the conventional ones , thanks to the smallness of r  parity violation required by neutrino oscillation data .",
    "similarly , processes such as @xmath4 and g-2 are essentially the same in brpv  msugra as in msugra and hence the resulting constraints for the latter still hold .",
    "the basic difference between brpv  msugra and the conventional r - parity conserving msugra scenario is that the lightest supersymmetric particle is no longer stable and it decays , typically inside the detector , consequently modifying the susy phenomenology at colliders .",
    "this has two important implications :    * the neutralino is no longer a viable dark matter candidate ; one needs to implement either an axion - like , gravitino  @xcite or possibly majoron dark matter scheme  @xcite .",
    "clearly no `` susy dark matter '' constraint should be applied in these models . *",
    "any susy particle can be the lightest one , hence it can be electrically charged . for the case of interest assumed here",
    "it means that the parameters that lead to stau - lsp are perfectly viable for the searches , and are indeed included in our analysis .",
    "as far as searches go , the lsp decay implies that the missing transverse momentum of the events gets diminished and , correspondingly , an increase of the multiplicities for jets and/or charged leptons in the final state is expected .",
    "most remarkably , within a large range of brpv  msugra parameters , the lsp can live long enough to give rise to displaced vertices , opening a new window for its search and study .",
    "an interesting phenomenological feature of brpv not present in generic rpv schemes is that it naturally leads to displaced vertices  .    in this work",
    "we have analyzed in detail the impact of the lsp decay on the potential of the lhc to unravel the existence of supersymmetry in the simplest framework where its breaking is gravitational . to achieve this we start from the same conventional r  parity conserving search channels .",
    "we demonstrate that the lhc reach is reduced in the jets and missing transverse momentum channel with respect to the r  parity conserving scenario .",
    "furthermore , we also find that the final state topologies containing isolated charged same - sign di - leptons and trileptons are enhanced , partially compensating the loss of missing momentum brought about by the lsp decay in the all inclusive channel .",
    "an especially relevant fact is that the lsp decay can also lead to displaced vertices .",
    "we have also investigated the capabilities of the lhc experiments , atlas and cms , to unravel the existence of susy with r  parity violation through the search for displaced vertices with a high invariant mass associated to them .",
    "in fact , we find that at 100 fb@xmath0 the reach in the displaced vertices is typically larger than the one expected in the r  parity conserving scenario , especially at large @xmath5 values .",
    "as already mentioned , here we focus on the phenomenology of the effective theory described by the bilinear r - parity breaking supergravity model in which the mssm superpotential is supplemented by the following terms  @xcite @xmath6 with three extra parameters ( @xmath7 ) , one for each fermion generation .",
    "in addition to these bilinear terms , we must also include new soft supersymmetry breaking terms ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9 taken together , the new terms in the brpv lagrangian ( the three bilinear @xmath7 and the @xmath8 ) lead to the explicit violation of lepton number as well as r  parity .",
    "these terms also induce vevs @xmath10 , @xmath11 for the three left - type sneutrinos .",
    "note , that in general there is no basis where both sets of bilinear r - parity breaking terms can be eliminated at the same time . in the basis",
    "where the bilinear terms in the superpotential are rotated away one would obtain a model where the trilinear terms are approximately given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .    to further specify the model we assume a minimal supergravity framework with universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the unification scale .",
    "this model contains eleven free parameters , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath5 are the common gaugino mass and scalar soft susy breaking masses at the unification scale , @xmath16 is the common trilinear term , and @xmath17 is the ratio between the higgs field vev s . for convenience , we trade the soft parameters @xmath8 by the `` alignment '' parameters @xmath18 which are more directly related to the neutrino  neutralino properties  @xcite .",
    "the bilinear r  parity violating terms give rise to mixing between standard model and susy particles .",
    "for example , in these models neutrinos mix with the neutralinos giving rise to the neutrino masses and mixings after the diagonalization of a @xmath19 mass matrix for neutrinos and neutralinos . at the tree level",
    "only one neutrino picks up a mass while the others acquire masses only radiatively  @xcite .",
    "typically the tree - level scale is the atmospheric scale and , at this approximation , solar neutrino oscillations do not take place .",
    "the solar mass splitting is `` calculable '' and the solar angle acquires a meaning only when loops are included .",
    "it has been checked that current neutrino oscillation parameters  @xcite can be well reproduced provided @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the susy bilinear mass parameter  @xcite .",
    "decay length versus @xmath5 for @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and several values of @xmath15 .",
    "the widths of the three shaded ( colored ) bands around @xmath25 gev correspond to the variation of the brpv parameters in such a way that the neutrino masses and mixing angles fit the required values  @xcite within @xmath26 .",
    ", width=340 ]    the lsp lifetime depends upon the susy spectrum and the r  parity violating parameters .",
    "in order to satisfy the neutrino constraints , the r  parity violating interaction must be feeble , thus leading to a lifetime large enough to give rise to displaced vertices  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we depict in figure  [ fig : ldec ] the @xmath27 decay length for @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 gev , @xmath22 gev , @xmath30 , and sgn(@xmath21)=+1 .",
    "we scan randomly all possible brpv parameter values @xmath7 and @xmath31 , and for each sugra point in the plot , we accumulate hundreds of solutions compatible with neutrino oscillation data at 3@xmath32 level  @xcite . in this way",
    "the top ( red ) band corresponds to @xmath33 gev , and all possible values of @xmath7 and @xmath31 compatible with neutrino mixings and squared mass differences at 3@xmath32 .",
    "it is important to notice that in our brpv ",
    "msugra scheme , for a given msugra parameter there is a range of variation in the brpv parameters @xmath7 and @xmath31 .",
    "while this has no effect in the production cross sections of supersymmetric states , it affects the lsp decay length , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldec ] .",
    "however , the decay length can vary by not more than @xmath34 for a fixed value of @xmath15 over the allowed range of the brpv parameters , except at small @xmath5 where light scalars play an important part in the lsp decay .    apart from generating neutrino masses , neutralino ",

    "its good reach at small @xmath5 , it is not the main search channel in this range . certainly , the combination of the different final state topologies will help us to pinpoint the properties of the model .",
    "furthermore , we should not forget that the discovery of high invariant mass displaced vertices allow us to study directly the lsp such as its mass and branching ratios .",
    "moreover , we verified that displaced vertices possess a larger reach than the standard search channels not only at large @xmath5 , but also at large @xmath15 .",
    "we expect that for larger values of @xmath17 the reach in the displaced vertex analysis will be even better    since the lhcb experiment has excellent vertex capabilities , it is natural to conclude that the lhcb can also play an important part in the displaced vertex search for supersymmetry , at least in the first stages of lhc operation ,",

    "we have examined how the lsp decays via bilinear r  parity violating interactions degrade the average expected missing momentum in the reactions and shown how this diminishes the reach in the main _ canonical _ susy search channel that is the all inclusive topology .",
    "however we have seen how this can be overcompensated by the coverage obtained through the search for final states containing isolated charged leptons , specially the trilepton signal .",
    "moreover , we can also search for displaced lsp decays which can further increase the lhc reach for susy .",
    "we present the resulting reach in supergravity parameter space for two reference luminosities of 10 & 100 fb@xmath0 .    in the first stages of lhc operation , when the accumulated luminosity is rather small",
