    "cities are often compared to living organisms with a hierarchical organization consisting of cells , tissues and organs .",
    "likewise , people in a city form groups , groups form organizations serving certain functions , and interdependent complex relationships between functional organizations sustain the whole urban activities .",
    "such similarities are not only found in the correspondence between constituent elements of cities and living organisms but also in allometric scaling .",
    "as is a metabolic rate of a complex organism proportional to the @xmath6 power of body mass @xcite , various quantities related to activities or performances of a city depend on the scale of the city in a power - law manner @xcite .",
    "in particular , extensive work @xcite has revealed that an urban indicator @xmath7 quantifying city activity scales , on average , with the population size @xmath1 as a power - law : @xmath8 where @xmath5 is a scaling exponent .",

    ", obeys a superlinear scaling law ( @xmath3 ) while an indicator related to the degree of infrastructure development , such as the total length of electrical cables , the number of gas stations , the total road surface , etc . , scales sublinearly with the population size ( @xmath4 ) . due to the nonlinear scaling eq .",
    "( [ urban_scaling ] ) , a meaningful comparison between characteristics of individual cities requires evaluations of deviations from this average scaling behavior , instead of considering per capita quantity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to understand the reason why urban indicators representing creative productivities scale superlinearly and those corresponding to material infrastructures scale sublinearly .",
    "arbesman , kleinberg , and strogatz @xcite have proposed a network model ( aks model ) to explain superlinear scaling found in creative productivities .",
    "they introduced hierarchical social distances between nodes representing people in a city .",
    "a network is formed by connecting nodes with the edge probability decaying exponentially with the social distance .",
    "assuming that the individual productivity yielded by an edge increases exponentially with the social distance , the aks model gives superlinear scaling of creative productivity @xmath0 if the total contribution from connected node pairs separated by the social distance @xmath10 is an increasing function of @xmath10 , giving linear scaling otherwise .    in order to explain both superlinear and sublinear scaling of urban indicators ,",
    "bettencourt @xcite has worked with four simple assumptions : ( 1 ) citizens explore the city fully to benefit from it and the city develops in a way to make this possible .",
    "( 2 ) the infrastructure network volume @xmath11 grows in a decentralized way in order to connect each addition of a new inhabitant , namely , @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the number of people in the city and @xmath13 is the average distance between individuals .",
    "( 3 ) the product of average social output and the volume spanned by individual s movement is constant of city size @xmath1 , which means that human effort is bounded .",
    "( 4 ) the urban indicator @xmath0 related to a creative productivity is proportional to the number of local social interactions . according to the bettencourt s model , the scaling exponent is given by @xmath14 for the superlinearly scaled creative productivity and @xmath15 for the sublinearly scaled infrastructure volume , where @xmath16 is a positive exponent that depends on the fractal dimension of human travel paths .    despite these two pioneering and suggestive theories ,",
    "the mechanism of urban scaling has not yet been completely understood .",
    "although the aks model @xcite gives a possible explanation of superlinear ( or linear ) scaling of creative productivities and describes how the social structure ( i.e. , human relations ) affects the scaling exponent @xmath5 , sublinear scaling for urban indicators reflecting infrastructures has not been argued . on the other hand ,",
    "the bettencourt s model @xcite demonstrates both superlinear and sublinear scaling for a creative productivity and an infrastructure volume , respectively .",
    "however , it is not clear how the social structure influences urban scaling , because this theory is based on a continuum model .",
    "furthermore , the scaling exponent @xmath5 always appears symmetrically as @xmath17 for superlinear and sublinear scaling , hence a variety of real - world nonlinear urban scaling can not be described by this model .",
    "it is therefore important to explain consistently both superlinear and sublinear scaling in the context of the relation between the scaling behavior and the social structure in the city .    in this paper , we propose a model to account for urban scaling by representing human relations in a city by a geographical network in which nodes close to each other are more likely to be connected .",
    "it is assumed that an urban indicator @xmath0 is given by the sum of the activities produced by individual connected node - pairs and that the individual activity @xmath18 depends on the euclidean distance @xmath19 between connected nodes @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we show that the urban indicator scales superlinearly or linearly with the population size @xmath1 when the activity @xmath18 represents a creative productivity that is an increasing function of the euclidean distance @xmath19 and scales sublinearly or linearly if @xmath18 decreases with @xmath19 as the strength of the demand for infrastructure does .",
    "this result is consistent with observed urban scaling phenomena .",
    "we also predict that urban indicators representing either creative productivities or infrastructures are proportional to the population size ( i.e. , linear scaling ) if the geographical constraint in the network formation is strong enough .",

    "ii , the urban scaling exponent @xmath5 is analytically calculated in sec .",

    "this result coincides with the scaling behavior of real - world urban indicators .",
    "it has been also found that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath1 if networks are formed under a strong geographical constraint .",
    "these results have been confirmed by numerical simulations .    in our argument ,",
    "nodes are assumed to be placed on a @xmath23 dimensional euclidean space and the geographical distance plays a crucial role to understand urban scaling . to interpret @xmath0 under a negative @xmath80 as a degree of infrastructure development ,",
    "the nodes must be arranged in a physical ( geographic ) space .",
    "this condition , however , can be relaxed for superlinear scaling .",
    "we can derive the same result for superlinear scaling of @xmath0 even in the case that nodes are placed on a more general metric space in which eqs .",
    "( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ yij_def ] ) with the abstract distance @xmath19 are a reasonable condition for the network formation and a plausible relation for the individual activity , respectively .",
    "for example , in a sociometric space , where social distances between nodes are defined , we can consider that nodes socially close to each other are more likely to be connected and a socially more distant node pair yields a higher productivity .",

    "we concentrated , in this work , on the average scaling behavior of the urban indicator .",
    "however , the actual urban indicators of individual cities deviate from the average values of @xmath0 expected from their population sizes",
    ". statistical properties of the fluctuations of @xmath0 have been extensively studied by recent works @xcite . within the framework of the present model",
    ", we can also consider such fluctuations by evaluating @xmath0 defined by eq .",
    "( [ y(n)_def ] ) instead of its average given by eq .",
    "( [ y(n)_def2 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the urban indicators of cities with the same population size @xmath1 are caused , in our model , by different network configurations due to different spatial arrangements of nodes and different assignments of the attractiveness .",
    "in addition to this structural network effect , the deviation of @xmath0 from the average value could arise from the fluctuations in the model parameters .",
    "there are four parameters in our model , i.e. , @xmath43 characterizing the strength of the geographical constraint in the network formation , @xmath42 describing how widely distributed the attractiveness is , the fractal dimension @xmath23 of the population density , and @xmath80 specifying the euclidean - distance dependence of the individual activity .",
    "although this work assumes that these four parameters remain constant over a set of cities , violation of this assumption will also lead to fluctuations in the urban indicator . by comparing statistical properties of the predicted fluctuations of @xmath0 to those observed in actual urban indicators we would be able to assess how well our model describes urban scaling phenomena .",
