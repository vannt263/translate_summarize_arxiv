    "the non - gaussianities of the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation now receive increasing attentions because they are important tools to discriminate models of inflation @xcite .",
    "ongoing and near future project such as planck satellite @xcite , cmbpol mission @xcite , litebird satellite @xcite would reveal the properties of the temperature and polarization anisotropies in detail .",
    "such e - mode polarization anisotropies are sourced by both curvature and tensor perturbations @xcite , while only tensor ( and vector ) perturbations can generate b - mode polarization anisotropies @xcite . therefore ,",
    "even when one estimates the `` auto '' bispectra of the temperature and the e - mode polarization fluctuations , not only the auto bispectra but also the cross bispectra of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations are indispensable .    for slow - roll inflation models with the canonical kinetic term @xcite , maldacena evaluated the full bispectra , including the cross bispectra , of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "inflation models are now widely generalized into more varieties such as k - inflation @xcite , dbi inflation @xcite , ghost inflation@xcite , g - inflation @xcite , and so on . however ,",
    "almost all the works on the non - gaussianities in these inflation models concentrate only on the auto bispectrum of the curvature perturbations @xcite , which is insufficient for evaluating the bispectra of the temperature and e - mode polarization anisotropies of the cmb , as explained above . to our surprise ,",
    "as far as we know , the full bispectra of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations have not yet been obtained even for k - inflation @xcite except for ref .",
    "@xcite where the primordial scalar - scalar - tensor cross bispectrum has been calculated for inflation models with an arbitrary kinetic term .",
    "there are several related works on the primordial cross bispectra . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors show the primordial tensor - scalar cross bispectra induced from a holographic model and the scalar - scalar - tensor correlation has been discussed in the calculation of the trispectrum of the scalar fluctuations @xcite , so - called `` graviton exchange '' , and also in the context of one - loop effects of the scalar power spectrum @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors calculate the correlation between primordial scalar and vector ( magnetic fields ) fluctuations in possible inflationary models of generating primordial magnetic fields .    among the inflation zoo , the generalized g - inflation model @xcite occupies the unique position in that it includes practically all the known well - behaved single inflation models since it is based on the most general single field scalar - tensor lagrangian with the second order equation of motion , which was proposed by horndeski more than thirty years ago @xcite and was recently rediscovered in the context of the generalized galileon @xcite .",
    "indeed , it includes standard canonical inflation @xcite , non - minimally coupled inflation @xcite including the higgs inflation @xcite , extended inflation @xcite , k - inflation @xcite , dbi inflation @xcite , @xmath0 inflation @xcite , new higgs inflation @xcite , g - inflation @xcite , and so on .",
    "thus , once we analyze properties of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations in the generalized g - inflation , one can apply the result for any specific single - field inflation models .",
    "so far , the power spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations were studied in @xcite and the general formulae for them have been given there .",
    "it has been pointed out that the sound velocity squared of the tensor perturbations as well as that of the curvature perturbations can deviate from unity .",
    "then the auto bispectrum of the curvature perturbations was estimated in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) and found to be enhanced by the inverse sound velocity squared and so on .",
    "more recently , the auto bispectrum of the tensor perturbations was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to be composed of two parts .",
    "the first is the universal one similar to that from einstein gravity and predicts a squeezed shape , while the other comes from the presence of the kinetic coupling to the einstein tensor and predicts an equilateral shape .",
    "what remains to be studied are the bispectra of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations in the generic theory .    in the case of the most general single field model , not only auto bispectrum of scalar perturbations but",
    "also that of tensor perturbations can be large enough to be detected by cosmological observations , e.g. , planck satellite , as is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which suggests that cross bispectra can be large as well .",
    "for such a case , it is not necessarily justified to consider only auto bispectrum of curvature perturbations even when you evaluate the auto bispectrum of temperature ( or e - mode ) fluctuations because cross ones can significantly contribute to it even if the tensor - to - scalar ratio is ( relatively ) small .",
    "furthermore , when we try to evaluate the cross bispectra including b - mode fluctuations , the cross bispectra of tensor and scalar perturbations are indispensable because b - mode fluctuations are produced only from tensor perturbations .",
    "these facts are quite manifest even without any reference nor estimation .",
    "in such a situation , in this paper , we compute the cross bispectra of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations in the generalized g - inflation model .",
    "the formulae in the limits of k - inflation and potential - driven inflation are also given as specific examples .",
    "the organization of this paper is given as follows .",
    "in the next section , we briefly review the most general single field scalar - tensor lagrangian with the second order equation of motion . in sec .",
    "iii , quadratic and cubic actions for the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations are given .",
    "the full bispectra , including the cross ones , for them are discussed in the section iv .",
    "the special limits for them in the cases of k - inflation and potential driven inflation are taken in sec . v.",
    "final section is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "the lagrangian for the generalized g - inflation is the most general one that is composed of the metric @xmath1 and a scalar field @xmath2 together with their arbitrary derivatives but still yields the second - order field equations .",
    "the lagrangian was first derived by horndeski in 1974 in four dimensions  @xcite , and very recently it was rediscovered in a modern form as the generalized galileon @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the most general extension of the galileon  @xcite , in arbitrary dimensions .",

    "the above lagrangian can also reproduce the non - minimal coupling to the gauss - bonnet term  @xcite .",

    "in this section , we consider two representative examples of inflation to estimate the amount of non - gaussianities from tensor and scalar perturbations .",
    "the first example is general potential - driven inflation studied in ref .",
    "this class of inflation models includes variants of higgs inflation enabled by enhancing the effect of hubble friction .",
    "these potential driven models have @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "next , to see the impact of generic @xmath193 more clearly , we study k - inflation as another example .",
    "we wish to treat a wide class of potential - driven inflation models at one time . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce six @xmath2-dependent functions to write @xmath194 in particular , the above form includes different higgs inflation models proposed so far  @xcite .",

    "would - be leading terms in @xmath198 and @xmath199 have been removed without loss of generality .",

    "we assume that the following slow - roll conditions are satisfied : @xmath200 it is convenient to define @xmath201.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the slow - roll approximation the gravitational field equations reduce to @xmath202    now it is easy to see that @xmath203 and @xmath204 so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are slow - roll suppressed .",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath192 and @xmath191 .",
    "the coefficients of the cubic terms are given by @xmath205 and @xmath206 where @xmath207 as defined in ( [ mudefine ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the other coefficients are of higher order in the slow - roll parameter : @xmath208 .      to extract the effect of the nontrivial sound speed ,",
    "let us consider k - inflation , which is the simplest model with a generic value of @xmath193 . in the case of k - inflation ,",
    "@xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , we have @xmath212 with @xmath213 and @xmath214 , which simplifies the coefficients in the cubic lagrangians : @xmath215 note that in deriving the above coefficients we have not invoked the slow - roll expansion .",
    "in this paper we have presented the full bispectra , including the cross bispectra of the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations , in the generalized g - inflation model which is the most general single - field inflation model with the second order equations of motion .    in the event full observations of these quantities could be made , we could extract many pieces of interesting information on the underlying theory .",
    "for example , by observing three - point tensor correlation function , we can in principle determine the kinetic coupling to the einstein tensor through @xmath216 .",
    "another interesting quantity is the cross bispectrum of two tensors and one scalar . if we could observationally identify their coefficients @xmath217 and @xmath218 , we could in principle determine @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 independently with the help of the three - tensor bispectrum which would provide a consistency relation of the theory for the tensor - to - scalar ratio ( [ tensortoscalar ] ) .",
    "let us next turn to two - scalar and one - tensor bispectrum whose effective lagrangian is given by ( [ ssh ] ) .",
    "its most interesting component is the first term proportional to @xmath219 which could be singled out by taking @xmath220 small . in the standard canonical inflation as well as in k - inflation",
    ", the coefficient simply takes @xmath221 as derived in ( [ kc ] ) , where we have used the consistency relation in the last equality .",
    "we can also show that this feature remains valid in the case where a sizable _ local _ non - gaussianity is generated as in the cases of the curvaton scenario @xcite and the modulated reheating scenarios @xcite .",
    "in such case curvature perturbation @xmath222 is sourced by another scalar field which we denote by @xmath223 and its fluctuation by @xmath224 .",
    "one can relate @xmath222 and @xmath224 as @xmath225 using the @xmath226-formalism @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath223 has the lagrangian @xmath227 with @xmath228 .",
    "since the dynamics of @xmath223 is practically frozen during inflation and it practically behaves as a massless minimally - coupled field , one can expand @xmath229 in this regime where @xmath230 is its expectation value in the domain including our horizon today .",
    "then the mean - square fluctuation amplitude of @xmath223 is given by @xmath231 the latter being an outcome of ( [ deltan ] ) , and it determines the relation between @xmath224 and @xmath222 , too .",
    "then the effective lagrangian representing tensor - scalar - scalar coupling is generated from the kinetic term of @xmath223 in this case and reads @xmath232 note that in this case the sound speed is equal to unity . thus we find that if the sector responsible for the generation of curvature perturbations is minimally coupled to gravity with no extra galileon - like terms , @xmath233 takes the same form whether they are generated by the inflaton or another scalar field . thus this term can provide a test of the generalized galileon as a source of the structure of the universe .",
    "it is a non - trivial issue how to normalize the cross bispectra . in this paper , we have normalized them by the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation .",
    "this is mainly because these cross bispectra generate the auto- and the cross - bispectra of the temperature fluctuation and the e - mode polarization , which are mainly sourced by the curvature perturbation .",
    "however , such a normalization may be inadequate for the cross bispectra including the b - mode polarization .",
    "therefore , we need to directly investigate the impacts on the cmb bispectra and it is interesting to see the cmb cross - bispectra between the temperature fluctuations and b - mode polarizations which are sourced directly from the primordial cross - bispectra of the scalar and the tensor modes @xcite .",
    "constraining the model parameters by cmb bispectra is a work in progress @xcite .",
