    "frantic activity has ensued over the past few months following the report of an excess of _ fermi _ gamma - ray events clustered around 100 and 140 gev in a region near the galactic centre @xcite , as well as in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilation and internal bremsstrahlung have rapidly emerged as possible explanations @xcite .",
    "alternative interpretations have also been advanced @xcite .",
    "more recently things have heated up even further with a tantalising claim of similar line emission at 111 and 129 gev in 16 unassociated sources detected in the second _ fermi_-lat catalogue ( 2fgl ) .",
    "the detection could provide independent support for a dark matter origin for the line emission seen near the galactic centre region @xcite .",
    "certainly , such coincidence might not only help us unlock the mysteries of dark matter , but it would also prove the existence of dark matter subhaloes @xcite .    in the absence of obvious flaws in the analysis ,",
    "the collected evidence has risen as a sort of dark knight  albeit an indirect one  that might finally grant us non - gravitational access to dark matter .",
    "intrigued by this possibility , we explore the nature of the 16 _ fermi _ unassociated sources listed by @xcite . based on machine - learning classification algorithms and multiwavelength examination , we show that 14 out of the 16 unassociated _ fermi _ sources displaying the lines are likely gamma - ray agn .",
    "therefore , rather than strengthening the argument , the detection of an identical signal in the su & finkbeiner sample appears to disprove a dark matter origin for the _ fermi _ features unless a set of very unique astrophysical conditions are met .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sibyl ]",
    "we explain the machine - learning classifier _ sibyl_. in section [ classp ] we compile class prediction for the 16 unassociated _ fermi _ sources listed in @xcite .",
    "section [ multi ] details multiwavelength searches for the potential counterparts of these 16 objects .",
    "finally , we provide some interpretation in section [ interp ] .",
    "confirmation of a truly unique type of gamma - ray source would hint that we may have finally found the much sought - after dark matter subhaloes predicted by numerical simulations .",
    "as our base for such comparison , we use _ sibyl _ , a random forests classifier that generates predictions on class memberships for unassociated _ fermi_-lat sources using gamma - ray spectral features extracted from the 2fgl @xcite .",
    "only a brief description of _ sibyl _ is presented here since it has been thoroughly covered in the literature @xcite .",
    "random forests ( rf ) create an ensemble of classifiers with a tree structure , where the splits captures the complexity of the feature space among the set of training objects @xcite . to tag a new object , rf lets each classifier vote and then outputs a prediction based on the majority of votes ( p@xmath1 ) .",
    "rf also computes proximities between pairs of objects and quantifies which variables are instrumental to individual classification .",
    "previously we performed a similar analysis for unassociated 2fgl sources at @xmath2 @xcite . here , we extend the coverage down to @xmath3 in order to encompass the entire su & finkbeiner sample .",
    "the classifier presented has been implemented with the r randomforest package @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    we complement the radio matches with observations from the most ambitious x - ray program for counterpart identification currently underway @xcite , which aims to image the totality of unassociated _ fermi _ sources with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope . to date , nine sources have been imaged by",
    "_ swift _ with times ranging from 1.1 to 19.1 ks of useful exposure .",
    "source extraction to identify all significant x - ray sources within the _ fermi _ error ellipses was performed with _ wavdetect_. source positions and positional errors were derived using _",
    "xrtcentroid_. x - ray counts ( 0.12.4 kev ) were extracted from a circular region with a 20 pixel radius ( 47 ) .",
    "the background was extracted from an annulus with a 20 pixel ( inner radius ) to 30 pixel ( outer radius ) around the source . throughout , we used _",
    "xselect _ to include counts with grades 012 .",
    "six out of the nine _ swift _ fields have single potential counterparts within their _ fermi _ 95% confidence error ellipses .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalogue @xcite adds four more potential single x - ray counterparts to the final count .",
    "table [ table2 ] summarises the counterpart candidates in each case .",
    "of the 16 sources , seven have both radio and x - ray tentative counterparts .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows x - ray flux versus radio flux density of associated _ fermi agn_. superposed are the potential seven with simultaneous radio and x - ray counterparts .",
    "the results are in line with radio and x - ray counterpart flux levels expected for typical _ fermi _ agn .",
    "but we must emphasise that without dedicated spectral classification in the optical these must be considered solid but tentative counterparts at this stage .    ) .",
    "small dots represent associated _ fermi _ agn . the black squares mark the seven unassociated sources from the su & finkbeiner sample with tentative counterparts in both radio and x - rays.,width=297 ]",
    "we have presented class predictions of the random forest classifier _ sibyl _ for 16 unassociated _ fermi _ sources showing line emission at 111 and 129 gev .",
    "we find that 14 out of 16 unassociated sources in the su & finkbeiner sample are agn candidates with prediction accuracy rates greater than 97.1% .",
    "in addition , we have detected 10 x - ray and 13 radio potential counterparts distributed over the 16 unassociated  95% confidence error ellipses that would be consistent with the agn predictions .",
    "we emphasise the word potential here as a more exhaustive detective work must be completed to confirm the appropriate counterpart for each unassociated source .",
    "it was postulated that the gamma - ray lines among the unassociated were perhaps connected to dark matter subhaloes dragged into the galactic disc @xcite . however , assuming an isotropic distribution , at least 160 _ fermi agn _ are expected at @xmath4 . to date only about 100 are accounted for in the 2fgl @xcite .",
    "thus , it makes astrophysical sense that agn are making up an important fraction of the su & finkbeiner sample even at relatively low galactic latitudes .    in light of these results , the dark matter origin for the narrow gamma - ray features observed by _",
    "fermi _ is in question .",
    "were these dark matter subhaloes @xcite , coincidence between the galactic centre and the su & finkbeiner sample would certainly confirm a dark matter particle origin @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation changes dramatically if the unassociated sources showing an identical line signature are agn , as implied by both machine - learning classifiers and the multiwavelength arguments just presented .",
    "dark matter could be fed into agn jets and the galactic centre , but such an explanation feels contrived given the hadronic and leptonic dominance in the gamma - ray photon field @xcite .    instead",
    ", a distinct astrophysical mechanism unrelated to dark matter annihilation and linked to nearby agn ( @xmath0 to avoid redshifted lines ) such as accretion , bubble @xcite , or jet @xcite phenomenology would appear to be more logical .",
    "however , we note that although many _ fermi _ agn display photons above @xmath5 10 gev , only a handful of soft agn ( @xmath6 ) exhibit maximum photon energies greater than 100 gev at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xcite might be detecting a fiendish cluster of events imprinted by ebl absorption in the same energy band , but completely unrelated in origin to the emission observed near the galactic centre region .",
    "oddly enough , the lines reported by @xcite appear to be only present collectively in unassociated sources and do not appear as pronounced among associated sources , including well - known gamma - ray agn @xcite .",
    "therefore , we must also admit the possibility that the spectral signatures detected by _ fermi _ originate from confounding instrumental or calibration problems @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ calibration team will have the final word on the matter very soon , but independent efforts must be made to scan the public _ fermi _ archive for gamma - ray lines among individual agn at @xmath0 , as well as in diffuse emission outside the galactic plane .",
    "we shall hear more about this energy region by the end of the year with the recently unveiled h.e.s.s .",
    "ii @xcite , and even more sensitive observations will be available later on after completion of the cherenkov telescope array @xcite . in the future , a dark knight might rise again . until then",
