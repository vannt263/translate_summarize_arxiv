    "in the simple constituent quark model , where the proton is made of two constituent @xmath16 quarks and one @xmath17 quark , a good explanation of static properties e.g. magnetic moment can be achieved .",
    "however , experimental results of the pion - nucleon sigma term value , strange magnetic moment @xmath5 , strangeness contribution to nucleon form factor @xcite as well as the apparent violations in nucleon - antinucleon annihilation reactions involving @xmath1 meson @xcite indicate that the proton might contain a substantial strange quark - antiquark ( @xmath3 ) component .",
    "the strangeness sigma term appears to lie somewhere in the range of @xmath18% of the nucleon mass @xcite .",
    "the substantial okubo - zwieg - iizuka ( ozi ) rule violations in the @xmath19 annihilation reactions involving @xmath1 meson may suggest the presence of an intrinsic @xmath20 in nucleon wave function @xcite , for instance , the presence of a @xmath21 piece in the @xmath22 wave function .",
    "with such an assumption , the @xmath23 meson could be produced in @xmath19 annihilation reactions via a shake - out or rearrangement of the strange quarks already stored in the nucleon without the violation of the ozi rule .",
    "there are other explanations of the ozi rule violation without introducing strange component in the nucleon such as the resonance interpretation , instanton induced interaction @xcite , and rescattering @xcite .",
    "the emc spin experiment @xcite on deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarised muons by longitudinally polarised protons revealed the first time that the polarization of the strange quark sea may contribute to the proton spin @xmath6 a significant negative value .",
    "this experimental result was confirmed by the subsequent deep inelastic double polarization experiments .",
    "@xcite analyzed all the available data then in a systematic way and found @xmath24 . among a large number of theoretical works ,",
    "cheng and li apply the chiral quark model ( chqm ) to explain the spin and flavor structure of proton @xcite . with the fluctuation of the proton into a kaon and a hyperon",
    ", they can explain the negative polarization of the strange quark sea and get other theoretical results consistent with the dis experimental results .    however , the configuration of strange quarks in the nucleon is still an open question .",
    "the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath7 can be extrapolated from the strange magnetic form factor @xmath25 at the momentum transfer @xmath26 measured in the parity violation experiments of electron scattering from a nucleon @xcite .",
    "most experimental measurements suggest a positive value for @xmath7 , in contrast to the recent experiment data @xcite and most theoretical calculations which have obtained negative values for this observable  @xcite .",
    "a recent work  @xcite has proposed a different form for the strangeness content of the proton which has the strange quark piece in terms of pentaquark configurations instead of the 5-quark component which consist of a @xmath2 cluster and a @xmath3 pair proposed for solving the puzzle of violation the ozi rule .",
    "different pentaquark configurations that may be contained in the proton may yield both positive and negative values for the strangeness spin and magnetic moment of the proton .",
    "the experimental results on @xmath5 , which is extracted from experimental data on @xmath25 , are rather uncertain due to the large uncertainties in @xmath25 and the extrapolation approach .",
    "so it is believed that the proton - antiproton reactions involving @xmath1 production may be another platform to be applied to tackle the possible configuration of strange quarks in the proton . in the present work",
    "we consider the strange content in the proton wave function in three models , namely , the @xmath2 cluster with a @xmath3 sea quark component , kaon - hyperon clusters based on the chiral quark model , and the pentaquark picture @xmath4 .",
    "the theoretical @xmath6 , @xmath5 and branching ratios of the reactions @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) will be compared to experimental data .",
    "we resort to the @xmath11 quark model @xcite and the nearest threshold dominance model @xcite to obtain quantitative predictions for the branching ratios of the annihilation reactions from atomic @xmath29 states with the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the proton wave functions are briefly described in section 2 while @xmath6 and @xmath5 are calculated and discussed in section 3 for various strangeness quark configurations . in section 4",
    "we evaluate the branching ratios for the reactions @xmath27 for the three forms of proton wave functions by using the @xmath11 quark model .",
    "finally a summary and conclusion are given in section 5 .",
    "the proton wave function in the presence of strange quarks may include a 5-quark component @xmath31 in addition to the @xmath2 quark component , taking generically the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the amplitudes for the 3- and 5-quark components in the proton , respectively @xcite .",
    "the possible spin - flavor structures of the 5-quark components discussed in the @xmath35 annihilation process are considered in the next three subsections .",
    "we consider the idea that strange quarks are present in the form of an @xmath3 sea - quark component in the proton state .",
    "this idea was proposed for describing the apparent violation of the ozi rule in the @xmath36 production process  @xcite and in more general form used to discuss the @xmath23 meson production in @xmath19 annihilation reactions  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding 5-quark component for this model can be written in fock space as @xmath37 where the subscripts denote the spin coupling of the quark clusters , @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the amplitudes for the spin 0 and spin 1 components of the admixed @xmath3 pairs .",
    "another , more general form of the 5-quark component was proposed and analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . instead of first generating a meson coupling to a baryon cluster",
    ", they consider the genuine 5-quark or @xmath58 pentaquark component in the proton . in this model",
    "the 5-quark component in this model may be expressed in terms of the @xmath9 and the @xmath59 wave functions as @xmath60 the flavor wave functions for the @xmath61 components are usually constructed by coupling the @xmath9 to the @xmath62 flavor wave function .",
    "the configurations studied in  @xcite include at most one unit of orbital angular momentum .",
    "the favored configurations are connected to a positive sign for the strangeness magnetic moment and a negative one for the strangeness contribution to the proton spin .",
    "in the nonrelativistic quark model the strangeness magnetic moment operator @xmath63 and the strangeness contribution to the proton spin operator @xmath64 are defined as @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 is the strangeness counting operator with eigenvalue + 1 for an @xmath68 and -1 for an @xmath69 quark and @xmath70 is the constituent mass of the strange quark . to calculate the matrix elements of these operators explicit forms of the spin - flavor wave functions of the proton including orbital angular momentum",
    "are needed .    for the first model",
    "the spin - flavor wave function can be constructed by coupling the @xmath71 configuration to the @xmath72 cluster .",
    "since the admixed @xmath0 carries negative intrinsic parity , an orbital p - wave ( @xmath73 ) has to be introduced into the nucleon quark cluster wave function . the simplest configuration ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) corresponds to an 1s - state of the @xmath0 pair moving in a p - wave relative to the ( uud ) valence quark cluster of the nucleon .",
    "then the 5-quark component with total angular momentum 1/2 can be written in the general form : @xmath74_{j_i } \\otimes ( uud)_{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\rangle_{\\frac{1}{2},m_{ps\\bar{s}}=\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] with the normalization @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , for the proton wave function in the chqm , where the sea - quark contributions are embedded in the pseudoscalar mesons , a relative @xmath50-wave between the pseudoscalars and the @xmath2 or hyperon clusters has to be included . the spin - flavor wave function with spin + 1/2 for each coupled meson - baryon state of eq .",

    "one has to carefully consider the coupling of the color , spin , flavor and spatial parts to construct the total wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the color part of the antiquark in the pentaquark states is a @xmath77 $ ] antitriplet , denoted by the weyl tableau of the su(3 ) group .",
    "hence the color symmetry of all the @xmath9 configurations is limited to a @xmath78 $ ] triplet in order to form a pentaquark color singlet labeled by the weyl tableau @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "three flavor symmetry patterns exist for the @xmath9 system corresponding to the octet representation for the proton : @xmath10_f , [ 22]_f $ ] and @xmath78_f $ ] characterized by the @xmath80 young tableau .",
    "however , the pentaquark should be antisymmetric under any permutation of the four quark configuration .",
    "if the spatial wave function is symmetric , the spin - flavor part of the @xmath9 component must be a @xmath10 $ ] state in order to form the antisymmetric color - spin - flavor @xmath9 part of the pentaquark wave function .",
    "for instance , the flavor symmetry representations @xmath10_f$ ] and @xmath78_f$ ] may combine with the spin symmetry state @xmath81_s $ ] to form the mixed symmetry spin - flavor states @xmath10_{fs}$ ] ( the explicit forms may be found in @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we consider only the case that the @xmath9 component is in the ground state with the spin symmetry @xmath81_s$ ] corresponding to spin zero , and the relative orbital angular momentum between the @xmath9 component and the @xmath62 is of one unit to obtain the positive parity for the proton wave function .",
    "theoretical results for the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath5 of the proton and the strangeness contribution to the proton spin @xmath6 are listed in table i. in the first model we have fixed the configuration parameters as @xmath82 .",
    "the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath5 depends explicitly on @xmath83 , which is related to the amplitude for the @xmath3 quark cluster with spin 0 .",
    "setting @xmath84 is equivalent to excluding the quantum number @xmath85 for the @xmath3 admixture in the nucleon wave function connected to the the production of @xmath86 and @xmath87 in @xmath35 annihilation as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the chiral quark model always gives results for @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are negative , the size of the strangeness contribution depends on the coupling @xmath88 . for the third model ,",
    "we show only the results for the cases where the @xmath9 component is in the ground state with the spin - flavor configurations @xmath10_{fs}[211]_{f}[22]_{s}$ ] and @xmath10_{fs}[31]_{f}[22]_{s}$ ] and the relative motion between the @xmath9 component and the @xmath62 is a @xmath50-wave .",
