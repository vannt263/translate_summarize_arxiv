    "<S> we argue that the increase of the ratio baryon / meson due to the presence of strong colour fields and percolation in ultra - high energy hadronic collisions , helps to explain some of the global features of ultra - high energy cosmic ray cascades at @xmath0 ev and , in particular the observed excess in the number of muons with respect to current models of hadronic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable agreement with the small value and slope of the average depth of shower maximum @xmath1 vs shower energy  as seen in data collected at the pierre auger observatory  can be obtained with a fast increase of the p - air production cross - section compatible with the froissart bound .    </S>",
    "<S> strong color fields , percolation , high energy cosmic rays , extensive air showers , muons , elongation rate    13.85.tp , 12.40.nn , 96.40.de , 96.40.pq , 96.40.tv    the largest source of uncertainty in the prediction of observables of cosmic - ray induced atmospheric showers at ultra - high energy ( uhe )  above @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> ev  stems from our limited knowledge of the features of hadronic interactions in this energy range . </S>",
    "<S> qcd - inspired models of multi - particle production need to be extrapolated to energies far beyond those reached in terrestrial accelerators , and in regions of phase space of the collisions usually not covered in collider or accelerator experiments . on the other hand inferring the properties of the hadronic interactions at uhe in cosmic ray experiments is not an easy task which is hampered by the low luminosity of the primary beam , and by the unknown nature of its constituents . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , data are relatively scarce at such high energies .    </S>",
    "<S> the composition of cosmic rays at high energies is still a matter of controversy , mainly because direct measurements are only possible up to @xmath3  ev  @xcite . above this energy , </S>",
    "<S> attempts to infer the mass number @xmath4 of the primary particle are based on measured shower variables and are rather indirect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> observables such as the number of muons at ground level @xmath5 , or the depth at which the maximum in shower longitudinal development occurs @xmath6 , are sensitive to both the nature of the primary and the hadronic interaction model . in particular , the muon component of the shower is a powerful tool for the validation of hadronic interaction models .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently an analysis of the data collected with the hybrid detector of the pierre auger observatory @xcite , indicated that the number of muons produced in uhe showers is about 1.5 times larger than that predicted by the qgsjetii @xcite model assuming proton primaries . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion seems to be rather independent of the primary cosmic ray composition . </S>",
    "<S> this  deficit of muons \" in the hadronic interaction models is consistent with the one found in the recent analysis of more direct data on muons collected with the yakutsk array @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the pierre auger collaboration has also reported that the arrival directions of 20 out of the 27 most energetic detected events above 57 eev ( 1 eev = @xmath7 ev ) correlate with the positions in the sky of nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , which are candidate sources of cosmic - ray production and acceleration to ultra - high energies . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out @xcite that this result together with the observed suppression of the cosmic - ray flux above 60 eev @xcite , is consistent with the hypothesis that most of the cosmic rays reaching the earth are protons from nearby astrophysical sources @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are also measurements of the average depth of maximum shower development as a function of energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath1 is smaller than what is predicted by current hadronic models assuming a proton dominated composition , and moreover it increases with energy slower than expected @xcite .    in this work under the assumption of proton primaries , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence of strong colour fields in uhe collisions increases the ratio of baryons to mesons ( @xmath8 ) with respect to hadronic models currently used in the simulation of atmospheric showers . </S>",
    "<S> this has the effect of increasing the number of muons , following the tendency seen in data . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the behaviour of @xmath6 is not strongly affected by strong colour fields , and conclude that available data can be explained with a rapid increase of the p - air production cross section , but sill compatible with the froissart bound .    </S>",
    "<S> the global features of particle production in hadron - hadron ( hh ) , hadron - nucleus ( ha ) and nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions seem to be well described by models where particles are produced in the decay of longitudinal strings formed in the initial stage of the interaction @xcite . however , in order to explain some effects observed at sps and rhic energies , such as the limited growth of the rapidity particle density in the central region , or the increase of the average transverse momentum and strangeness with the number of participant nucleons @xcite , one requires the introduction of fusion of strings @xcite or more generally percolation of strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one should mention here that the results obtained within the string percolation model coincide to a large extent with those of the colour glass condensate model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the key idea in the present work is that fusion and percolation of strings lead to the formation of strings with higher string tension , and this implies that mass effects  formation of strange quarks , di - quarks , etc ...  become less important . in the schwinger model of string fragmentation </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the probability of generating a set @xmath9 of quarks and anti - quarks and a conjugate set @xmath10 out of the vacuum , each one with mass @xmath11 , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the string tension . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath13 tends to infinity the probability ( [ eq : prob ] ) becomes less and less dependent on @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the role of strong colour fields to increase the fraction of heavier particles has also been emphasized in @xcite .    if we consider a single @xmath14 string , with @xmath15 being the mass of the u and d quarks ( @xmath16 gev ) , and @xmath13 the 3-representation string tension @xmath17 , and neglect strangeness and higher mass flavours , we have that the probability @xmath18 of producing a baryon is given by @xmath19 and the corresponding probability @xmath11 for meson production is @xmath20 so that the ratio @xmath8 is @xmath21 this is our reference value for the ratio @xmath8 at low energies .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall next consider the effect of exchanging a quark by a diquark , as in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : probb ] ) and ( [ eq : probm ] ) , in more complex systems . in @xmath22 @xmath22 fused strings , if they are in the su(3 ) 6-representation with @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 which is larger than eq.([eq : ratiobm ] ) . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> if we consider @xmath22 @xmath22 in the 8-representation with @xmath25 , one obtains @xmath26 which is again larger than eq.([eq : ratiobm ] ) .    in general , if we consider @xmath27 quarks in @xmath28 representations of su(3 ) ( see for instance @xcite ) , the highest dimension representation corresponds to @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 being a number of the order of @xmath33 such that for the quark diquark interchange we obtain , @xmath34 and , in the @xmath35 limit , @xmath36 we take this result as an indication for the increase of the ratio @xmath8 as the energy or centrality of the collision increases .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth emphasizing that the enhancement of baryons or antibaryons over mesons is not only due to a mass effect as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> in fact in addition to the larger color and string tension in the percolation model , the way the cluster formed from the overlapping of individual strings decays , favours the increase of the ratio @xmath8 with energy and/or density of strings . </S>",
    "<S> consider a cluster formed by several @xmath37 strings . </S>",
    "<S> this cluster behaves as a @xmath38 string , where @xmath39 is composed of the different flavours of the individual @xmath37 strings . </S>",
    "<S> the fragmentation of a cluster occurs through the successive creation of @xmath38 complexes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this mechanism leads to an enhancement in the production of baryons over mesons , because the large number of quarks in the cluster of strings favours the formation of particles with higher number of constituents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coalescence and recombination models @xcite proposed similar mechanisms to explain the suppression of pion yields relative to baryons and antibaryons observed in relativistic heavy - nuclei collisions @xcite .    the increase with energy of @xmath8 helps to explain the excess of muons in data when compared to existing hadronic interaction models . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , increasing the number of baryons and anti - baryons more muons are produced . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been shown with a simple toy model and also in the framework of the epos model of hadronic interaction in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the number of baryons decreases the number of neutral pions @xmath40 which decay into @xmath41 and initiate electromagnetic subshowers in which muon production is typically very small . </S>",
    "<S> moreover a decrease in the amount of shower energy going into @xmath40s increases the total number of hadronic interactions in the shower , in which copious muon production typically occurs . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath40s tend to stretch shower development due to the production of electromagnetic subshowers with comparatively larger @xmath6 than hadronic subshowers of the same energy . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> one would expect that decreasing the number of @xmath40s  increasing the @xmath8 ratio  would limit the rate of increase of @xmath6 with energy , a tendency seen in cosmic ray data . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that an increase of the @xmath8 ratio also leads to a reduction in the number of charged pions , but as a first approximation charged pions play the same role as baryons in shower development and hence this has no consequences for either pion production or the behaviour of @xmath6 .    in order to test these effects in a more quantitative way and make contact with auger data , </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated sets of 100 proton induced showers at energies ranging from @xmath42 ev up to @xmath43 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid , one - dimensional shower simulation described in  @xcite was used to obtain the average number of muons at auger ground level @xmath44 , and the average depth of shower maximum @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we used the sibyll 2.1 hadronic interaction model described in @xcite which includes a ratio @xmath45 constant with energy . </S>",
    "<S> then we modified the sibyll 2.1 model and implemented a value of @xmath8 according to the following relation @xmath46 normalized to the sibyll 2.1 value at low energy @xmath47 ev where accelerator data exists .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : muons ] we show the relative increase in the number of muons when increasing the ratio @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative difference between the average number of muons at ground predicted by sibyll 2.1 with @xmath48 , and the number of muons predicted by sibyll 2.1 but with @xmath8 following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bm ] ) is shown as a function of shower energy . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that at the highest energies the number of muons can increase by as much as @xmath49 in agreement with auger data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remark that the choice of the underlying hadronic model is not relevant for our results , since we are only interested in the relative change of the number of muons when increasing the ratio @xmath8 .     </S>",
    "<S> constant with energy @xmath50 , and with the sibyll 2.1 model but with a modified ratio @xmath8 following eq.([bm ] ) @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative difference is calculated as @xmath52/\\langle n_\\mu({\\rm sib})\\rangle$ ] and is shown as a function of shower energy . </S>",
    "<S> the lines joining the points are just to guide the eye . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xmax ] we show the behaviour of @xmath6 with energy as obtained in proton - induced showers with the sibyll 2.1 model , and with the sibyll 2.1 model with the ratio of @xmath8 modified according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bm ] ) . as explained above , increasing the ratio @xmath8 decreases the slope of @xmath53 vs @xmath54 curve and the value of @xmath53 due to the decrease in the production of @xmath40 , which would otherwise induce electromagnetic subshowers evolving deep into the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the decrease of @xmath53 is not large enough to explain the trend observed in the data collected at the pierre auger observatory @xcite also shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ xsection ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the filled squared points without lines are the data on @xmath53 collected at the pierre auger observatory @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> another important consequence of the presence of strong colour fields in the region where the interaction occurs is the percolation of strings . </S>",
    "<S> more details on the percolation model can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of special importance for shower development is the prediction of the percolation model on the inelasticity @xmath55 , defined as one minus the fraction of momentum carried by the fastest ( leading ) particle . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , all existing high energy strong interaction models based on qcd and qcd evolution , predict an increase with energy of the inelasticity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the hadronic generators sibyll  @xcite and qgsjet  @xcite , widely used in the analysis of cosmic ray data . </S>",
    "<S> however as shown in @xcite , above the percolation threshold the inelasticity decreases with energy . </S>",
    "<S> this has important consequences for shower development as studied in @xcite , among them a decrease of the inelasticity tends to propagate the primary energy deeper into the atmosphere and increase @xmath6 in contrast to what is seen in auger data . </S>",
    "<S> note that the observed decrease of @xmath53 with energy @xcite is at odds with the reported reduction of @xmath4 at high energies @xcite as we shall see next , the behaviour of @xmath6 with energy may be accommodated with an increase of the p - air cross section compatible with the froissart bound .    </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented the inelasticity predicted by the percolation model @xcite in the sibyll 2.1 hadronic generator . also we decreased the position of the first interaction and subsequent hadronic collisions by increasing the p - air and @xmath57-air production cross section in a similar manner as was done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have changed the sibyll 2.1 energy dependence of the production cross section @xmath58 using the relation @xmath59 which we apply for @xmath60 ev , so that at lower energies one reproduces accelerator data . moreover , since the sibyll cross section behaves as @xmath61 the modified cross section in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsection ] ) clearly behaves as @xmath62 , saturating the froissart bound but not violating it . </S>",
    "<S> the p - air cross section in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsection ] ) and the sibyll 2.1 p - air cross section are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xsection ] .    ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sibyll cross section behaves as @xmath61 , while the modified cross section behaves as @xmath62 , saturating the froissart bound but not violating it . ]    </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath1 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xmax ] where a fair agreement with auger data can be seen . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the changes implemented in the sibyll 2.1 cross - section , while modifying the inelasticity and the @xmath8 ratio according to what strong colour fields induce , affects @xmath53 much less . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that an increase of the p - air cross section also induces a decrease of the rms of the @xmath6 distribution with respect to what current models of hadronic interaction predict for proton - initiated showers .    </S>",
    "<S> also we have checked in our shower simulations , that the increase in the number of muons is fairly insensitive to both the decrease of inelasticity due to percolation of strings , and to the increase of the p - air and @xmath56air cross - section , the dominant effect being the increase of the ratio @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that strong colour fields associated to high dimension representations of @xmath38 strings , together with the @xmath38 string breaking mechanism , lead to the increase of the @xmath8 ratio with respect to current hadronic models in which the @xmath8 ratio is @xmath63 and constant with energy . </S>",
    "<S> for uhe cosmic ray - induced showers this results in an increase of the average number of muons in the shower at ground level , and in a ( small ) decrease of @xmath53 . in order to further decrease @xmath53 and approximately agree with data , a large , but still compatible with the froissart bound increase of the p - air and @xmath57-air cross sections with energy </S>",
    "<S> is required . </S>"
