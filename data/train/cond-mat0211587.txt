    "it is of general believe that due to the close @xmath4-shell gd ions do not show exotic magnetic behaviour in solid - state environment .",
    "however , recently it has been reported that some gd alloys exhibit interesting phenomena including large magnetoresistance effects @xcite .",
    "a metal - to - insulator - like transition has been reported for gd@xmath5ge@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a large number of the gd - based intermetallics reveal large negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) effects arising from peculiar magnetic precursor effects @xcite .",
    "recently , the gd transition - metal silicides and germanides with 2:1:3 stoichiometry ( alb@xmath2-type hexagonal structure @xcite ) came into focus , as some of these compounds even show a kondo - like minimum in the temperature dependence of the resistivity well above the magnetic ordering temperatures @xcite . in polycrystalline gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath3 ( @xmath7 k ) , the compound of interest in this article , a pronounced minimum occurs at about 45 k , which has been confirmed in single crystalline gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 saha _ _ et al .  _",
    "the minimum persists even when diluting the gd sublattice by y in ( gd@xmath0y@xmath1)@xmath2pdsi@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "_ investigated the electronic structure for @xmath9pdsi@xmath8 with @xmath10=la , ce , gd and tb by photoemission and band - structure calculations @xcite and found that in gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 the gd 4__f _ _ level is far below the fermi level and hence should not significantly hybridize with the band states . in order to shed some light on the unusual magnetic and electronic properties of this compound we systematically investigated the spin dynamics of ( gd@xmath0y@xmath1)@xmath2pdsi@xmath3 by electron - spin resonance ( esr ) .",
    "the samples were prepared by arc melting and are taken from the same batch as those used in previous investigations by mallik _ _ et al .  _",
    "esr measurements were performed in a bruker elexsys e500 cw - spectrometer at x - band frequencies ( @xmath11 9.47 ghz ) equipped with a continuous he - gas - flow cryostat in the temperature region @xmath12 k. the polycrystalline samples were powdered , placed into quartz tubes and fixed with paraffin .",
    "esr detects the power @xmath13 absorbed by the sample from the transverse magnetic microwave field as a function of the static magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra is improved by recording the derivative @xmath15 with lock - in technique .",
    "typical esr spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] and illustrate the evolution of the gd resonance with y concentration @xmath16 ( left column ) and temperature @xmath17 ( right column ) .",
    "as expected , no esr signal could be observed for @xmath18 . for @xmath19 , within the whole paramagnetic regime the spectrum consists of a broad , exchange narrowed resonance line , which is well fitted by a dysonian line shape @xcite .",
    "as in the present compounds the linewidth @xmath20 is of the same order of magnitude as the resonance field @xmath21 , both circular components of the exciting linearly polarized microwave field have to be taken into account .",
    "therefore the resonance at the reversed magnetic field @xmath22 has to be included into the fit formula for the esr signal , given by @xmath23 this is an asymmetric lorentzian line , which includes both absorption and dispersion , where @xmath24 denotes the dispersion - to - absorption ratio .",
    "such asymmetric line shapes are usually observed in metals , where the skin effect drives electric and magnetic microwave components out of phase in the sample and therefore leads to an admixture of dispersion into the absorption spectra . for samples small compared to the skin depth one",
    "expects a symmetric absorption spectrum ( @xmath24 = 0 ) , whereas for samples large compared to the skin depth absorption and dispersion are of equal strength yielding an asymmetric resonance line ( @xmath24 = 1 ) . at high y concentrations the spectra are nearly symmetric with respect to the resonance field in accordance with the pure absorption spectra for @xmath24=0 .",
    "with decreasing @xmath16 they become more and more asymmetric corresponding to an increasing parameter @xmath24 .",
    "to check , whether the skin effect is the reason for the asymmetric line shape , we have to estimate the skin depth @xmath25 from the electric resistance @xmath26 and the microwave frequency @xmath27 ghz ( @xmath28 vs / am ) . using the resistivity values determined by mallik _ _ et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite - for example at 60 k for @xmath29 , @xmath26 = 0.25 m@xmath30 cm - we find a skin depth @xmath31 5.7 @xmath32 m .",
    "therefore the skin depth is comparable to or even smaller than the grain size @xmath33 in accordance with the asymmetry of the esr spectra .",
    "the large increase of the linewidth on decreasing temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , right column ) results in an increasing uncertainty in determining both , resonance field @xmath34 and dispersion - to - absorption ratio @xmath24 accurately , because both quantities are correlated , while the linewidth remains relatively unaffected .",
    "as the resistivity of the present compounds @xmath35 k changes by only 20% @xcite , it is reasonable to fix the parameter @xmath24 for @xmath36 k at a value determined for @xmath37 k , where @xmath24 is found to be nearly temperature independent ( e.g.  @xmath38 for @xmath39 ) .",
    "the integrated intensity @xmath40 of the resonance line measures the spin susceptibility @xmath41 of the esr probe , @xmath42 . in the case of nonzero dispersion",
    "the intensity is determined by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the amplitude of @xmath15 and @xmath45 takes changes of the dispersion into account .",
    "however , one has to be careful with this formula on approaching @xmath46 .",
    "if the skin depth is small compared to the grain size , the microwave probes only a small fraction of the sample and changes of the resistivity with temperature also change this fraction . then the esr intensity is not a sensible measure of the spin susceptibility anymore .",
    "fortunately , the relative changes of the resistivity are small in the temperature regime of interest , and hence the esr intensity is even useful , when @xmath24 approaches unity .",
    "figure [ intensity ] shows both @xmath40 and the susceptibility data from mallik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for @xmath47 .",
    "good agreement between the two sets of data can be observed throughout the whole concentration range in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "the peaks in the intensity appear at @xmath48 and 8k for @xmath49 and 0.5 respectively .",
    "esr spectra of ( gd@xmath50y@xmath51pdsi@xmath8 for @xmath52 ( 4 - 15 k ) , which have to be multiplied by the given amplification factors in order to get the original amplitude.,width=302 ]    below the nel - temperature @xmath53 we still observe a distorted resonance signal for @xmath54 as shown in fig .  [ spectra04 ] for @xmath47 , but due to the reasons mentionend above deviations between esr intensity and the magnetic susceptibility appear .",
    "the inverse quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are sketched for @xmath47 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ intensity ] , exhibit a linear temperature dependence in the paramagnetic regime ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the samples with @xmath49 and 0.5 follow a ( @xmath58 curie - weiss ( cw ) law , with positive curie - weiss temperatures @xmath59 of 25,17 and 6 k , respectively . for @xmath60 the reciprocal esr intensities @xmath55",
    "show no deviations from a curie law ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the resonance lines below @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ spectra04 ] ) exhibit a splitting into a broad absorption band with decreasing temperature , which can be interpreted in terms of antiferromagnetic powder spectra with a small antiferromagnetic gap @xcite . however , the observation of resonance lines below @xmath53 is a rather unusual feature of intermetallics @xcite .",
    "generally , the esr linewidth @xmath20 measures the spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath62 of the gd - spins , whereas the resonance field @xmath63 or effective g - value ( @xmath64 ) gives information about the local static magnetic field at the gd site .",
    "the linewidth is plotted versus temperature for all investigated samples in fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the linewidth shows a monotonous behaviour that can be fitted very well with a linear function @xmath65 .",
    "then the linewidth passes a mininum at @xmath66 and increases drastically while approaching the transition temperature to the magnetically ordered state .",
    "this feature is clearly seen for @xmath54 , whereas for higher y concentrations we can only detect the onset of a line broadening in the temperature range investigated .",
    "temperature dependence of the esr linewidth @xmath20 in ( gd@xmath67y@xmath68pdsi@xmath8 .",
    "the solid lines represent a linear fit for @xmath69 , yielding a concentration dependence ( inset ) of the slope according to eq .",
    "( [ korringaslope]).,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ resonancefield ] we show the temperature dependence of the resonance field @xmath63 for all samples under investigation .",
    "again , we have to distinguish between the gd - rich concentration range @xmath54 and the samples with @xmath70 : + at high temperatures @xmath63 is nearly constant for all concentrations and yields a g - value @xmath71 slightly below the free - electron value . for @xmath72",
    "k and @xmath73 we observe a dramatic shift of the resonance to lower fields , which coincides with the onset of the line broadening mentioned above . finally , a distinct kink and an upturn to higher fields follows .",
    "the peak - like minima for @xmath74 are found at 20 , 15 and 6 k respectively .",
    "these temperatures are consistent with the esr intensity and the magnetic - ordering temperatures obtained from measurements of the heat capacity and the magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the @xmath75-value and the gd - esr linewidth bear important information on the interaction between the localized gd-4f spins and the conduction electrons ( for a review on the theory of esr in metals , see e.g.  barnes @xcite , for experimental reviews see taylor @xcite and elschner and loidl @xcite ) . due to its half - filled 4f shell ( @xmath76 ,",
    "spin @xmath77 ) the orbital momentum of gd@xmath78 vanishes ( @xmath79 ) , and therefore the gd spin does not relax directly to the lattice .",
    "but the energy is transferred via the exchange interaction to the conduction electrons , which themselves couple to the phonons of the lattice .",
    "this process is usually known as korringa relaxation and yields a linear increase of the resonance linewidth @xmath80 with increasing temperature @xmath17 , where the slope @xmath81 is proportional to the squared electronic density of states @xmath82 at the fermi energy .",
    "this holds as long as the back - scattering rate @xmath83 of the conduction electrons to the gd ions is small compared to the scattering rate @xmath84 of the conduction electrons to the lattice .",
    "if however the former becomes comparable or even larger than the latter , the so called bottleneck effect occurs and the korringa law is modified by the ratio @xmath85 of both rates .",
    "this results in a reduced linear increase following @xcite : @xmath86 as the back - scattering rate @xmath83 is proportional to the concentration of the localized spins ( here @xmath87 gd concentration @xmath88 ) , it is possible to prove the influence of the bottleneck effect in a given compound by the dependence of the linewidth on the concentration of magnetic ions .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] shows the slope @xmath89 of the linear high - temperature increase of the linewidth @xmath90 in ( gd@xmath0y@xmath91)@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 as a function of the gd - concentration ( 1-x ) .",
    "it is well fitted by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , assuming a constant electron - lattice relaxation rate @xmath84 , where @xmath92 can be expressed as @xmath93 with a constant parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting korringa rate @xmath94  oe / k is typical for usual metals and related intermetallic compounds ( e.g. lacu@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "hence , at high temperatures the system behaves like a regular metal under the strong influence of the bottleneck effect for all gd concentrations .",
    "usually in unbottlenecked metallic hosts the @xmath75-value of gd differs from the value in non - metallic hosts by @xmath95 with the coupling constant @xmath96 between the gd - spins and the band states @xcite .",
    "the fact that at high temperatures the @xmath75 value is not strongly shifted from @xmath97 , which is usually observed for gd@xmath78 in insulators @xcite , is in accordance with the strong bottleneck .",
    "the 122-type compounds have been intensively investigated by esr by kaczmarska and coworkers during the last 15 years @xcite .",
    "they found that the esr behaviour of dense gd systems depends on the transition metal with the thermal broadening parameter @xmath89 decreasing with increasing number of @xmath98 electrons from co to cu .",
    "for gdpd@xmath2ge@xmath2 a value of 2.0 oe / k was found,@xcite which is enhanced in comparison to 1.2 oe / k for gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "this result is in agreement with regard to the relative gd concentration , which is higher in the latter compound .",
    "the increase of the resonance linewidth and the shift of the resonance field towards lower temperatures on approaching magnetic order is a common feature of intermetallic compounds containing rare - earth ions like gd as reported in the experimental review by taylor and coles @xcite .",
    "generally , for antiferromagnetic compounds they find no esr signal below @xmath99 , but a broadening of the line at about @xmath100 .",
    "some systems like pd@xmath8gd and eual@xmath6 , however , show an esr signal also below @xmath99 , which has been attributed this as common to materials which undergo metamagnetic transitions in magnetic fields comparable to the resonance field @xcite .",
    "exactly such a behaviour has been reported for gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 . at 2 k saha _",
    "et al . _  observed two metamagnetic transitions in fields of 3 and 9 koe @xcite . on approaching @xmath101 from below both transitions coincide at about 3 koe , the value of the resonance field .",
    "together with the spectra we observed below @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra04 ] ) for @xmath54 , we conclude that our system belongs to the same peculiar class of intermetallics as pd@xmath8gd and eual@xmath6 .",
    "+ apart from the existence of these signals and the suggested connection to metamagnetism , we found another very interesting feature : + to analyze the linewidth in ( gd@xmath0y@xmath91)@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 at low temperatures in more detail , we remind the magneto - resistance effects , which indicate the importance of the scattering of the conduction electrons on the localized gd spins .",
    "indeed , the comparison of the resistivity data reported by mallik et al .",
    "@xcite with the epr linewidth shows that the onset of the line broadening and the resonance shift ( fig .",
    "[ resonancefield ] ) coincides with the increase of resistivity for @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "[ dhresist ] we show the esr linewidth and resistivity for the pure compound using a scaling that reveals the similarity of the increase in resistivity and linewidth .",
    "temperature dependencies of esr linewidth ( @xmath102 ) and resistivity ( @xmath103 , taken from @xcite ) in gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath3.,width=377 ]    unfortunately , only limited resistivity data has been reported for eual@xmath6 @xcite and pd@xmath8gd making it difficult to judge unambiguously , whether a correlation between linewidth and resistivity could be another common property of those materials . to date",
    ", the origin of such a behaviour can not easily be explained , but due to the fact that the gd 4__f _ _ level in gd@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 is about 2 ev below the fermi level the kondo effect can not be responsible for the observed minima @xcite , which is in agreement with the fact that the korringa rate and therefore the density of states at the fermi level is independent on @xmath16 .",
    "a comparison with other metallic systems reveals that also in many ordered and disordered magnetic compounds a minimum of the esr linewidth can be found at twice the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the increase of the linewidth is attributed to spin fluctuations , which could also give rise to the resistivity behaviour .",
    "another system where a correlation between esr linewidth and resistivity has been observed is fe doped la@xmath104sr@xmath1cuo@xmath105 @xcite , where localization effects were considered to explain that feature .",
    "indeed , a localization scenario has also been proposed by mallik _",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "_ in order to explain the resistivity minimum in ( gd@xmath0y@xmath91)@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 @xcite",
    ". very recently , eremin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave an explanation for the magneto - resistance effects of another gd alloy , namely gdi@xmath2 , which orders ferromagnetically close to room temperature @xcite .",
    "the concomitant anomalous peak in the resistivity has been attributed to scattering of the 5@xmath98 conduction electrons by localized 4@xmath106 electrons as a result of the specific topology of the fermi surface .",
    "a similar mechanism could also account for the correlation in resistivity and linewidth in ( gd@xmath0y@xmath1)@xmath2pdsi@xmath3 .",
    "in conclusion we performed electron - spin resonance measurements in ( gd@xmath0y@xmath91)@xmath2pdsi@xmath8 . on approaching magnetic order , both the esr linewidth and the resonance field are correlated with the resistivity minimum for @xmath54 .",
    "the high - temperature behaviour of the linewidth can be well described by a strong bottleneck effect , yielding a constant density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the observation of antiferromagnetic - resonance - like absorption lines below the nel temperature can be attributed to a metamagnetic transition in a magnetic field comparable to the resonance field .",
    "high - field esr measurements in single crystals should be performed in order to investigate the frequency and field dependence of the resonance lines .",
    "thus , it should be possible to separate the influences of metamagnetic transitions , spin fluctuations and localization scenarios .",
    "hopefully , such investigations will also trigger theoretical studies on localization effects in compounds with stable localized moments , which do not show a kondo effect .",
