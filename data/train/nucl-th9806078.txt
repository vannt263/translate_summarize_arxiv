    "the properties of vector meson in nuclear medium have been the focus of current interest due to its potential role to provide one with a direct observable of the nuclear medium effects , associated with chiral symmetry restoration , via dileptons in h - a or a - a reactions@xcite .",
    "indeed dileptons from relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic)@xcite seemed to suggest a non - trivial change of the vector meson spectral density in a hot / dense environment , which can be understood in terms of model calculations@xcite based on decreasing vector meson masses in hot / dense medium@xcite . however , model calculations@xcite based on changes of the vector meson spectral densities using hadronic variables also seem to explain the main features of the ceres data . in all of the approaches ,",
    "the central question is , how the spectral density changes in hot / dense matter@xcite . in this talk ,",
    "i will provide constraints on the three momentum ( @xmath3 ) dependence of the vector meson spectral density in nuclear medium@xcite .",
    "the approach is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) in qcd and provides model independent constraints that can be used to check the validity of any model calculation . in the second stage ,",
    "i will make a simple ansatz for the spectral density near the vector meson mass and look at what the parameters of the ansatz should be to satisfy the constraints@xcite .",

    "what follows , when we give result for explicit vector meson , we will use the currents @xmath8 for the @xmath0 mesons .    in general , because the vector current is conserved , the polarization tenser in eq.([ope1 ] ) will have only two invariant functions@xcite .",
    "@xmath9 where we assume the ground state to be at rest , such that , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . when @xmath13 , @xmath14 , as in the vacuum .",
    "in this work , we are only interested in the small three momentum ( @xmath3 ) dependence of the polarization functions .",
    "therefore we will make a small @xmath3 expansion of the correlation function and look at its energy dispersion relation at fixed @xmath3 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denotes the retarded correlation function .",
    "the ope for @xmath18 and its change in nuclear medium together with its corresponding energy dispersion relation provide constraints on the mass shift and spectral changes at @xmath19@xcite . in this talk",
    ", we will discuss the three momentum dependence by studying the ope and its changes in medium for @xmath20 .    in general , the ope @xcite for the polarization function at @xmath21 will look as follows .",
    "here we have pulled out the trivial @xmath23 dependence so that @xmath24 represents the residual wilson coefficient times matrix element of an operator of dimension @xmath25 and twist @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of spin index of the operator .",
    "the first set of terms comes from the ope of scalar operators , the second set from operators with spin , which have been written as a double sum of twist and spin .",
    "@xmath28 represents the two linearly independent sum of operators , which reflect the two linearly independent polarization directions .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse polarization functions can be obtained from eq.([ope4 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence coming from the first line of eq.([ope4 ] ) , namely the contribution from the scalar operators , comes from the @xmath3 dependence in @xmath29 .",
    "this forms the so called `` trivial '' @xmath3 dependence , and comes from replacing @xmath30 when going from zero to finite three momentum . here",
    ", we are not interested in these trivial dependence and will only look at the `` non - trivial '' @xmath3 dependence in @xmath20 . consequently the scalar operators do not contribute to @xmath20 .",
    "only operators with spins contribute to the non - trivial @xmath3 dependence . a prescription to find the nontrivial @xmath1 dependence in the ope is to first calculate the total contribution proportional to @xmath1 and then subtract out the trivial dependence ;",
    "@xmath31 , and its contribution to @xmath32 would be @xmath33 .",
    "another equivalent method is to express the polarization function in terms of @xmath34 and extract the linear @xmath1 term .",
    "in the linear density approximation , @xmath35 where the first term denotes the vacuum expectation value , which vanishes for operators with spin , and the second term the nucleon expectation value with the normalization @xmath36 . @xmath37 denotes the nuclear density and the mass of the nucleon respectively .    as in the vacuum",
    ", we will truncate our ope at dimension 6 operators .",
    "this implies that in our ope in eq.([ope4 ] ) , we will have contributions from @xmath38 .",
    "the nucleon matrix elements of the @xmath39 operators are very precisely known .",
    "the @xmath40 matrix elements appearing in the @xmath0 sum rule are similar to those appearing in electron dis@xcite and have been estimated @xciteup to about @xmath41 30% uncertainty from available dis data from cern and slac .",

    "we will use the set of k values obtained in ref.@xcite ; ( @xmath69 and we take @xmath70 . for the @xmath40 operators , we neglect the @xmath29 dependence .",
    "we will now make a borel transformation of @xmath71 times eq.([ope6 ] ) and look at the dispersion relation . @xmath72",
    "the reason for multiplying by @xmath71 is to get rid of any possible subtraction constants proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "there could be still further subtraction constants proportional to @xmath74 , which we included .",
    "@xmath75 should also be calculated in any model calculations .",
    "the value from particle - hole intermediate state gives @xmath76 for the longitudinal @xmath0 meson and zero for the transverse parts .",
    "after the borel transformation , the contribution from dimension=@xmath47 operators in the ope side is further divided by @xmath77 .",
    "this will make our truncation at dimension 6 operators valid even to smaller borel mass region . in fig.1 ,",
    "we have plotted ope as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "the solid line shows the left hand side of eq.([ope9 ] ) . the dot - dashed line without the twist-4 contribution and the long dashed line without dimension 6 contribution .",
    "at @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , the contribution of dimension 6 operators become about 40% of the contributions from dimension 4 operators for transverse ( longitudinal ) polarization .",
    "therefore , the ope should be reliable only above these minimum values of the borel mass , where the contributions from higher dimensional operators should be similarly suppressed . to support our argument ,",
    "we have also plotted ( short dashed line ) the contributions from adding up the infinite sum of the twist-2 operators .",
    "this is possible because for the twist-2 operators , all the moments are know . as can be seen from the figure",
    ", once we are above the minimum borel mass , the difference to the solid line is vanishingly small , confirming the validity of our ope above the minimum borel mass .    to 2.3 in    to 1.3 in",
    "[ fig : largenenough ]    to 2.3 in    to 1.3 in    [ fig : l1 ]    now the constraints for the spectral density would be eq.([ope9 ] ) , but applied only above @xmath81 .    as can be seen in eq.([ope9 ] ) , the borel transformation also changes the weighting factor of the spectral density to an @xmath82 .",
    "this has the following advantage for practical applications of our constraint . for small values of the borel mass , the contribution of the spectral density at larger energy is exponentially suppressed",
    "consequently , in a model calculation , one can concentrate on the change of the spectral density near the vector meson mass region and below and model the higher energy changes with a simple pole like contribution .",
    "we now show the result with the following ansatz of the spectral density .",
    "@xmath83 we expand this to linear order in @xmath1 to obtain @xmath84 and use the constraints in eq.([ope9 ] ) to obtain the best fit value of the constants @xmath85 . in the limit @xmath86 and @xmath87 ,",
    "the results were obtained in ref.@xcite which translates into the following momentum dependence in the mass .",
    "@xmath88 , where @xmath3 is in gev unit and @xmath89 is the nuclear matter density . for the @xmath46 meson ,",
    "0.023 changes to 0.016 .",
    "we have shown that there are model independent constraints on the three momentum dependence of the vector meson spectral density in nuclear medium .",
    "any model calculations can be checked to see if it satisfies the constraints .",
    "phenomenological models based on p - wave nucleon resonances seems to overestimate the momentum dependence@xcite .",
