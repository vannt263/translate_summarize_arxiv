    "the production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis .",
    "catalysis is relevant to many aspects of environmental science , e.g. the catalytic converter in automobiles and the dynamics of the ozone hole .",
    "catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly green chemistry due to the reduced amount of waste generated , as opposed to stoichiometric reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more collaterals products are formed . particularly , the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide using oxygen or air and a suitable catalyst such as vanadium pentoxide is well known for the sulfuric acid production . in this sense , the idea that the performance of these continuous catalytic processes under invariable conditions is highly efficient has gained great popularity , among chemical engineers that design catalytic reactors where the reaction will be carried out @xcite . however , very often the optimal conditions of the process can be achieved with the unsteady - state operation and the steady - state operation will be a particular case of the unsteady - state conditions .",
    "unsteady - state operation broadens the possibilities to form the profiles of the catalyst states , concentrations , and temperatures in reactors , thus providing more favorable conditions for the process performance @xcite .",
    "research work like this involve many areas of chemistry and physical - chemistry , but mathematical modeling is an important tool for rapid and reliable reactor development and design @xcite .",
    "the models are built from the basic studies of the reaction mechanism and kinetics , the transfer processes , and the interactions within the system .",
    "a detailed understanding of the elementary processes enables the construction of powerful and complex models for dynamic and steady - state simulation . with the aid of experimentally determined parameter values",
    "we can develop new processes or improve existing ones using dynamical simulations based on its mathematical models @xcite .    in this work , we present a mathematical model for the dynamical analysis of the reversible chemical reaction associated to the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide using oxygen in presence of the vanadium pentoxide catalyst , and we study some qualitative aspects concerning its solution as a previous step for the simulation of the catalytic reactor where the reaction will be carried out .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we present the mathematical model formulated as a problem of cauchy or initial conditions for the state variables that they define to the studied catalytic system , using as reference a model presented in @xcite . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we begin the qualitative study of the mathematical model demonstrating that this is a well - posed problem ; in addition we present the characteristics of the set of steady - state .",
    "next , section [ section4 ] is devoted to the study the solutions of the dynamics states for the system , we present the qualitative aspects concerning the behavior when the operation time is very long . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we present a brief discussion from the physicochemical point of view and we finalize with the conclusions of this research in section [ section6 ] .",
    "the studied catalytic system was the oxidation of sulfur dioxide ( so@xmath1 ) to sulfur trioxide ( so@xmath2 ) in presence of the vanadium pentoxide catalyst ( vn@xmath1o@xmath3 ) .",
    "the stoichiometric equation is : @xmath4 this reaction is exothermic in the forward direction , denoted by @xmath5 , and endothermic in the reverse direction , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "also , the reaction is a homogenous mixture , its reactans and products are in gaseous phase relative to the conditions of operation in the bed of the catalytic reactor .",
    "the speed of this reaction has been widely studied and the expression that suits best is the eklund s equation ( see @xcite ) : @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the reaction rate referred to the so@xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the partial pressure ( atm ) of the @xmath11-_th _ component ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the kinetic coefficient of reaction rate and @xmath14 the coefficient of chemical equilibrium , both as a function of the temperature ( for more details , see @xcite and @xcite ) .      for the sake of simplicity , we consider a fixed volume element of catalyst bed , with cylindrical geometry of finite length @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 , in which the reaction is carried out .",
    "we assume that gradients of concentration and temperature in the radial direction ( @xmath17 ) of the catalyst bed do not exist .",
    "these gradients are more noticeable in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath18 ) , but this spatial variation is not considered for the dynamic study that we will address in this work . finally , we consider only the variation of the concentration and temperature with respect to the time , and we assume that the changes in the total pressure of the system with respect to time are negligibles at each bed s output , therefore a balance of momentum was not needed .",
    "the complete problem of interest , obtained by a dynamic balance of matter and caloric energy , is described by the following equations :    @xmath19 \\label{eq3 } \\\\[-1.5ex ] \\frac{dt(t)}{dt}&=&\\frac{-r_{\\mbox{a}}\\left(1+\\epsilon x_{\\mbox{a}}(t)\\right)\\left(1-\\phi\\right)\\rho _ { c}\\left(-\\delta hr\\right)}{c_{\\mbox{a}_{0}}\\left(\\sum_{i}\\theta _ { i}cp_{i}+ x_{\\mbox{a}}(t ) \\delta cp\\right)+c_{\\mbox{i}}cp_{\\mbox{i}}},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the initial data @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the state variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the subscript ( @xmath24 ) was used to denote component so@xmath1 and subscript ( @xmath25 ) to denote inert present in the mixture such as bimolecular nitrogen .",
