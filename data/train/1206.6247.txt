    "slow relaxation and anomalous diffusion are common features of disordered systems .",
    "in particular , viscous liquids and highly packed matter show dynamically arrested states ( the glassy and the jammed state respectively ) characterized by steeply increasing relaxation times and spatially heterogeneous and intermittent dynamics  @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been also observed in sheared complex fluids and dense granular materials  @xcite , though in these latter cases it is much more difficult to understand as it requires a full dynamical description , due to the absence of a boltzmann - gibbs framework .",
    "the microscopic origin for these peculiar dynamically arrested states has been the subject of many studies .",
    "it has been shown that gels , colloids , and supercooled liquids generally exhibit rare mobility regions , and that an increase of mobility due to local relaxation events facilitates the dynamics , allowing other regions to participate cooperatively .",
    "such facilitation mechanism has been supposed to be one of the reasons underlying the slow dynamics and is at the origin of a vast class of models called kinetically constrained models ( kcm ) , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "these models are very simple from a thermodynamic point of view as they do not rely on any specific interaction potentials , but rather on particular dynamic evolution rules .",
    "they can be implemented under two closely related forms : facilitated spin systems or kinetically constrained lattice gases . in the first case ,",
    "spins represent mobile ( or active ) regions that flip between two or more states depending on the status of the nearest neighbors , which can either facilitate or forbid some spin flip . in the second case",
    ", the particle dynamics on a lattice follows some specific kinetic rule facilitating or suppressing some particle moves depending on the nearby local particle density . in the spin case",
    ", the control parameter is the temperature defining the density of excited states , while in the second case the particle density ( i.e the packing fraction ) plays a central role .",
    "both dynamic evolution rules aim at simulating the cage effect due to the steric hindrance among particles or spins belonging to the same dense region .",
    "we consider here a specific case of the latter class of models , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kob - andersen model with an externally applied field , as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown by numerical simulation that at high density , the model features a crossover from a flowing ( positive resistance ) regime at a small field to a negative differential resistance regime at a larger field .",
    "the latter regime is accompanied by unusual transport properties , including non - monotonic field dependence of the structural relaxation time and rheological - like behavior  @xcite .",
    "notably , the asymptotic large - deviation limit in which the fluctuation relation holds is hardly attained on the simulation timescale  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the anomalous space - time behavior of the system has been quantified by providing a description in terms of a field dependent dynamical transition between a flowing and blocked phase with the use of the language of the _ thermodynamic of histories_. this formalism has been used to evidence such a dynamical phase transition in undriven glassy systems @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an extended version of refs .",
    "@xcite in which numerical simulation results ( some of which were previously announced only ) are now fully reported and are better understood in terms of a theoretical approach . in particular , we give a microscopic description in configuration space of the two transport regimes and describe the nontrivial dynamical heterogeneities induced by the driving force .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the description of the model , with the characterization of the relationship between the current , the density of particles and the driving field in section [ current ] ; in section [ sptm ] we discuss the role of heterogeneities ; in section [ corr ] we compute global space correlation functions and in section [ traps ] we relate the microscopic structure ( traps and domain walls ) to the current .",
    "we consider the model proposed by one of us in ref .",
    "it can be viewed either as the kinetically constrained version of a @xmath0 asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) or as the kob - andersen model in presence of an external ( non hamiltonian ) field . in the absence of",
    "drive the model has been largely studied ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "we take a @xmath0 regular square lattice of size @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions , in which the particle density @xmath2 is a conserved parameter .",
    "the @xmath3 particles are initially put at random on the lattice , and an external field @xmath4 is applied along the horizontal direction , from left to right , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ default ] .",
    "in this situation , the probability that a particle moves against the field is @xmath5 , while each other direction is equiprobable .",
    "we shall set the boltzmann constant @xmath6 to 1 throughout the paper and absorb the temperature @xmath7 in the field definition , as the system we consider is purely athermal and no additional energetic interaction among particles is considered .",
    "the model dynamics is fully described by the following steps :    a.   a particle is chosen at random uniformly .",
    "b.   the particle attempts to move along one of the four possible directions , by choosing one of its nearest neighbors site randomly with equal probability ( @xmath8 ) . c.   the particle motion to",
    "the randomly chosen site takes place only if the site is empty and the particle has at least 2 empty neighbors before and after the move .",
    "this latter condition is the so - called _",
    "kinetic constraint_. d.   if the previous condition is satisfied , the particle always moves provided that motion does not occur against the applied field ; otherwise , if the particle attempts to move against the field , the motion occurs only if a random number uniformly chosen in the range @xmath9 $ ] is less than @xmath10 .",
    "this step is known as the _ metropolis rule_.    we measure time in unit of monte carlo sweep , corresponding to the random sequential update of the state of each particle on average . using a metropolis - like algorithm allows one to make contact with some standard results found in the literature on the asep and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) , which are recovered here in the absence of kinetic constraints and infinite field .",
    "the metropolis choice maximizes the number of moves in the field direction , because every attempt to move a particle along the field in the unit time and by a lattice spacing is always accepted .",
    "it is however not evident _ a priori _ that the transport properties are qualitatively independent from the chosen evolution rule .",
    "therefore we have implemented , as an alternative to the metropolis algorithm , a glauber - type dynamics according to which the probability to move a particle against or along the applied field depends on whether the random number , uniformly chosen in the range @xmath9 $ ] , is less or larger than @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "results are pretty robust and confirm our expectation that the transport properties we found are generic : they are essentially due to the presence of kinetic constraints that can not be violated , no matter the choice of transition probabilities .",
    "finally , we notice that the local time reversibility of the microscopic dynamics is satisfied .",
    "the central quantity we focus on in this section is the particle current , @xmath12 , which is defined as the number of jumps in the field direction minus the one in the opposite direction per lattice site and per unit time .",
    "it allows a first macroscopic characterization of the different transport regimes present in the system .",
    "we generally observe the existence of a threshold density @xmath13 , below which the current vs field relation is monotonic and above which the current exhibits a crossover from a linear ( ohmic ) regime to a negative differential resistance ( non ohmic ) regime at increasing field ; see figs .",
    "[ currdens ] and [ saturating ] .      in the small density regime , we expect that transport is weakly influenced by the presence of kinetic constraints : indeed numerical simulations show that the current vs field relation has a form much similar to the asep  @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ currdens ] .",
    "so we can set : @xmath14 with the pre - factor @xmath15 accounting for a further possible dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath4 ascribed to the constrained dynamics .",
    "we can consider two limiting cases . in the absence of constraints ,",
    "the pre - factor @xmath15 must be 1 , consistently with the asep .",
    "when the field becomes very large , the current saturates to a finite value , which for the standard tasep is @xmath16 .",
    "when increasing the particles density the effect of the constraints is to reduce the number of accessible paths in the configuration space and to slow down the dynamics so that the current is smaller than what expected in the unconstrained case .",
    "interestingly enough , even though the value of the pre - factor @xmath15 decreases continuously with increasing @xmath2 , it does not depend on the applied field , so that eq .",

    "the system size is @xmath18 .",
    "the current is a monotonic function of the field , saturating at large field .",
    "its behavior is qualitatively similar to the asep on a 2d square lattice .",
    "( b ) the density dependence of the current vs field relation can be easily accounted for by rescaling @xmath19 with the saturation current @xmath20 .",
    "the current ratio @xmath21 is exactly equal to the difference between forward and backward transition probabilities , @xmath22 . ]",
    "the similarity between the two behaviors - with and without constraints - suggests that the density dependence of @xmath23 can be estimated by the means of a mean - field approach that neglects the role of two - point and higher - order correlations .",
    "this approximation allows us to quantify the value of @xmath23 , writing @xmath24 which implies @xmath25 the analysis of this expression is straightforward : the factor @xmath8 accounts for the four possible directions of motion on the @xmath0 square lattice ; the term @xmath22 is the difference between the forward and backward transition probabilities ; the product @xmath26 gives the probability to find a particle on a certain site of the lattice with a nearby hole , if all correlations are neglected ; in this approximation , the last term @xmath27 simply accounts for the kinetic constraint : it reads as the probability to have at least two empty neighbors ( which is equal to that one of not having three occupied neighbors ) , and is counted twice because of the local microscopic reversibility of the kinetic rule . in the strong field limit , @xmath28 , the current saturates to the value @xmath29 as shown in fig .",
    "[ saturating](a ) , the mean - field approximation for the saturation current works well for small densities , suggesting the higher order correlations are negligible in that regime",
    ". when the density of particles increases , larger and larger correlations appear and above a certain density the mean field approach breaks down .     while for the classical tasep ( blue dashed line ) the peak is at @xmath30 .",
    "the mean - field formula ( [ mf ] ) ( red full line ) shows a good qualitative agreement that becomes quantitative at densities below the peak value .",
    "( b ) the most surprising property of the model : at high densities , @xmath31 , the simulations provide a current - field relation which is non - monotonic , as discussed in ref .",
    "simulation data at @xmath32 are obtained by using systems of size @xmath33 . ]",
    "notice that in spite of the local microscopic time - reversibility of the kinetic rule and particle - hole symmetry , the interplay of the driving force and the kinetic constraints leads , in the limit of very strong fields , to an asymmetric current vs density relation as shown in fig .",
    "[ saturating](a ) . the emergence of global particle - hole broken symmetry can be understood as follows : the two limit situations where only one particle is present on the lattice and where there is only one hole do not lead to the same current : the first case has a finite current @xmath34 while in the second case the current is strictly zero , due to the caging rules .",
    "one can compare the constrained model result at strong field with the tasep , where the current is given by a parabola peaked in @xmath30 . on the contrary",
    ", the constrained model is peaked around a smaller density ( @xmath35 ) and shows an almost zero current region at particle density near 1 .      at density above @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ saturating].(b ) , the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath19 emerges as the signature of extra mechanisms producing a more complex transport dynamics .",
    "such non - monotonic behavior is more and more pronounced with increasing density and is related to the growth of several orders of magnitude of the relaxation times of the system @xcite . at such high densities one can distinguish between two dynamical regimes : a positive resistance regime , where the current grows linearly with the field , and a negative resistance one , where the increase of the field corresponds to a decrease in the current , see fig .",
    "[ saturating].(b ) .",
    "the occurrence of non - monotonic transport can be qualitatively understood as a consequence of the decreasing probability of backword motion : at high density and increasing field , the particle rearrangements needed to remove obstruction to the flow , require more and more particle moves against , or normal to , the field direction , and this leads to a flow reduction .",
    "in particular , three distinct behaviors can be considered , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( i ) @xmath37 is finite ; ( ii ) @xmath37 is vanishingly small , if not zero ; and ( iii ) @xmath19 vanishes above a finite driving force , @xmath38 . numerical results suggest that regime i occurs in the range @xmath39 while regime ii appears at a higher density .",
    "the existence of the jamming regime iii can not be obviously ascertained due to the strong finite - size effects related to bootstrap percolation .",
    "the characterization of these effects is notoriously difficult and so this jamming regime will not be discussed here .",
    "rather , the main subject of this work will be the crossover between the linear and the non - monotonic transport regimes for a moderately large field and not too high particle densities .",

    "the previous analysis suggests that the increase of the density beyond the critical value @xmath36 corresponds to the switch between two qualitatively different transport regimes .",
    "the first step for the description of the high density regime is to analyze the configuration space , looking for a direct relationship between the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath19 and changes in the typical arrangements of the particles , similarly to what has been done for other one - dimensional ( 1d ) or 2d models ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    by the means of direct inspection",
    ", one can observe that the increase of the field leads to a transversal symmetry breaking in configuration space : not only do particles form longitudinal flowing bands along the field direction ( see figure [ quivermap ] ) , but one can already visualize emerging structures composed by blocked and empty regions , inducing an intermittent dynamics for particles ( fig .",

    "the long - time limit of @xmath48 represents the fraction of particles that never moved , i.e. , the fraction of permanently blocked particles .",

    "[ fig : g_rho0.86](a ) ] .",
    "the increased correlation between two nearby particles at a distance @xmath66 , especially in the transversal direction , can be qualitatively explained as a purely dynamic effect , which arises from the fact that at large density and large applied field , any particle needs first to move either backward or transversally to the field direction in order to proceed forward .",
    "this effect is more and more pronounced as the density and the applied field increase .",
    "the interplay of kinetic constraints and driving force thus generally enhances the clustering of particles and appears to be akin to a transversal static short - range attraction . in the longitudinal direction instead",

    "interestingly , in the longitudinal direction , instead , we observe an asymmetric distribution of particle motion at early times , with gaussian behavior slowly recovered at late times .",
    "the origin of the asymmetry in the distribution is due to the interplay between the drift caused by the field and the presence of kinetic constraints hindering crowded motion especially in the backward direction ( against the field ) .",
    "the tail on the left side stays exponential over a longer time than on the right side , because the backward events leading to larger structural rearrangements are more rare . at large enough field",
    "backward motion is so obstructed that the time it takes to approach the gaussian behavior can be exceedingly long to be observed .",
    "the differences we observed in the longitudinal and transversal motion are further confirmed by the analysis of the mean - square displacement . in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] we show the transversal and longitudinal mean - square displacements as a function of time . in the early stage of the dynamics , we see a sub - diffusive behavior in the transversal direction which correspond to the slow structural rearrangements of small size .",
    "this regime shrinks at large field and the asymptotic normal diffusion behavior is characterized by a diffusion coefficient that decreases with the applied field . in the longitudinal direction , the initial short - time sub - diffusion is followed by an intermediate super - diffusive behavior whose lifetime increases with the applied field .",

    "although the space and time averaged macroscopic observables exhibit several interesting features observed in more realistic systems , they shed little light on the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the blocking phase .",
    "several transport problems showing reduced mobility involve the presence of localization and trapping of the carriers @xcite . in these problems anomalous diffusion and broad distributions of the waiting times of the particles",
    "are often found along with a non - monotonous dependence of the particle current on the external forcing or bias . in this context , we want to relate @xmath19 to some specific properties of the domain walls or `` walls of holes '' that act as trapping and blocking regions for the dynamics .",
    "we have quantified these regions by the average value of their longitudinal @xmath69 and transversal @xmath70 sizes .",
    "to do so , we have chosen to define the walls in the simplest way : we decouple the computation in the two directions and count any contiguous region of at least 2 holes as a wall in the given direction .",

    "the emergence of domain walls can be explained by a brief analysis of the detailed microscopic moves for a specific configuration , and then extending the results to the general case .",

    "the probability to move against the field is almost suppressed while the transversal direction lets the system be mixed with a diffusive mechanism .",
    "let us consider a special configuration formed by a density region where a longitudinal domain of empty regions has a single mobile particle on its borders , as shown in figure [ origin].(a ) .",
    "if we follow the possible movements of the mobile particle and we consider that it can not move against the field , we see that after a time which depends on the diffusive vertical process the particle is pushed rightward in the sense of the field .",
    "other particles become mobile and they follow an analogous path , so that eventually the holes are concentrated in a basin that has lost the original longitudinal form in favor to a more transversal structure , similar to what was directly inspected in the snapshots of the evolution .    from this brief discussion",
    "we see that a general mechanism for the formation of the walls exists and depends actually on the probability of reversal moves @xmath73 .",
    "we also recognize that , at high densities , if we have wide and compact empty regions and adjacent wide and compact filled regions , small `` impurities '' formed by isolated empty sites play an important role in making specific particles mobile .      in order to properly justify the choice of the observable associated with the formation of domain walls ,",
    "we have computed the distribution of the transversal wall sizes : the data have been collected letting a system in its steady state evolve for  20 relaxation times and scanning the whole lattice at each montecarlo step .",
    "moreover , we repeated the process for 150 samples , in order to smooth the distribution .",
    "clearly , any distribution of lengths extracted from a simulation is affected by finite size effects ( i.e. the tails of the distributions are bounded by the system size ) so we are interested in large systems .",
    "we have chosen , for the majority of the results shown in the following figures , @xmath54 , given that the crossover length obtained in @xcite for the undriven kob - andersen model ranges from @xmath74 to @xmath75 for values of @xmath2 between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "we plot also the occurrence of very small structures of size 1 in order to show that they are at odds with respect to the rest of the data points .",
    "indeed , the picture we get is that the distribution of transversal sizes has an exponential form @xmath78 in a wide region bounded by the very small structures of size 1 and 2 ( which are in the limit of the definition of a wall itself ) and the tail of very large walls ( which are rare and whose observation also depends on the system size ) .",
    "we see that at @xmath79 such a distribution is very clearly an exponential and also interpolates walls of size 1 . as the field intensity increases ,",
    "two behaviors emerge that correspond roughly to the two current regimes : in both regimes , we have a large number of very small structures , but the occurrence of larger walls increases until a final distribution is reached which is almost the same both for @xmath80 ( around the current peak ) and @xmath81 ( far deep in the negative resistance region ) .",
    "very similar distributions are obtained for different densities , even if the @xmath19 curves at different @xmath2 have been shown to be quite different ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ currdens ] for comparison ) : for this reason we have collapsed all the distributions with respect to their average wall size , showing that a common behavior exists for any density ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ distr080 ] ) .",
    "the interesting feature of the exponential distribution is that it properly defines a very pertinent observable , the characteristic wall size @xmath82 corresponding to the average .",
    "the value of the average depends on the region of integration of the distribution : therefore , there is an important dependence of the obtained value on the inferior limit of integration , given that the upper bound corresponds to the size of the simulated system . in our case , we have chosen to ignore only the 1-site - long walls and compute the averages as if the walls were well defined for any size @xmath83 , obtaining the result in figure [ sizes ] .    .",
    "for each value of the external field , the distributions computed at different densities collapse and at a large field converge to the same distribution . ]",
    "a phenomenological argument that allows for a fit expression of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath84 is the following .",
    "let us say that the current flowing into the system has the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is simply the probability to pick a blocked configuration .",
    "we state that such a probability is expected to be , at a first order of approximation , proportional to the average transversal length of the domain walls .",
    "we show this with a concise reasoning : with a coarse grained view of the system , we can say that each domain wall blocks a number of particle which is proportional to its length .",
    "if we suppose that the spacing between the different walls @xmath87 depends only on the density , and we call @xmath88 the total number of walls , we can say that the average number of blocked sites is @xmath89 and the probability @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the total number of particles . assuming",
    "that the walls are uniformly distributed , we can estimate @xmath92 and finally write that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is only a fitting constant .",

    "this naive approach gives good results for densities near the critical value @xmath96 , as shown in figure [ fits ] , but fails for larger densities .",
    "it is also harder to reach the steady state at high densities and fields and properly compute the probability distribution of the wall sizes .",
    "( black dots ) .",
    "densities range from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath82 is determined independently from the simulation . ]    nevertheless , this approach can explain on a phenomenological basis the crossover region from the flowing to the blocking regime , with a formal expression analogous to what was proposed in @xcite , given that @xmath82 is a bounded growing function on the external forcing .",
    "we have investigated the spatio - temporal features of a simple kinetically constrained model driven into a non - equilibrium stationary state by a constant and uniform drive .",
    "the model can be considered as a generalization of the asep with an extra ingredient ( the kinetic constraints ) schematically representing the cage effect of glassy dynamics . in this type of systems",
    "the interplay between kinetic constraints and driving force generates some counterintuitive features which are observed in more complex driven athermal systems , such as highly packed colloidal suspensions and granular materials under shear .",
    "despite the minimalistic rules of our model , we found a rich transport behavior including a crossover from a linear - response regime , at weak field and low density , to a negative resistance regime at strong field and high density , and asymptotically broken ergodicity .",
    "we have shown that the flow reduction in the negative resistance regime is related to the emergence of a complex self - organization of dynamical structures which evolve intermittently and exhibit anomalous diffusion .",
    "intermittency is due to the competition between active and inactive regions , so that the system evolves through the alternative succession of low and high mobility configurations , compatibly with the scenario of a dynamical phase transition suggested by the thermodynamics of histories analysis  @xcite .",
    "as observed in other facilitated or kinetically constrained models @xcite , the appearance of dynamical heterogeneities is accompanied by enhanced diffusivity and is closely related to the intermittency in the formation and disruption of particle clusters .",
    "a systematic analysis of the typical space and time averaged observables of complex liquids shows that there are several interesting features associated with transport .",
    "these include a dynamically induced short - range particle attraction in the transversal direction , which is a signature of an enhanced particle clustering , and a regime of super - diffusion behavior in the longitudinal direction , whose duration increases at a larger applied field .",
    "we have highlighted the intermittent and heterogeneous nature of the dynamics by a careful analysis of the trajectories of motion of the particles that actually contribute to the global relaxation , and provided a phenomenological explanation of the crossover to the negative resistance regime .",
    "we have determined the characteristic dynamical length of the system and its dependence on the drift , connecting the detailed microscopic configuration space structure to the macroscopic flow .",
    "further investigations concerning the spatial distribution of the correlated walls of holes would improve the understanding of the relationship between the two - folded behavior of the current and the growth of @xmath100 with increasing the field strength .",
    "several future developments can be envisaged .",
    "extensions and generalizations of the present model shall explore other spatio - temporal features of non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "first , since the dynamics at strong fields and high densities partitions the systems in mobile and immobile dynamical regions , it would be interesting to analyze how the mobility percolates through the system and what are the geometric properties of the network of mobile particles when a space - dependent driving force ( mimicking an applied shear stress ) is applied .",
    "this would be necessary to address the transition from the shear - thinning to shear - thickening behavior in a more realistic setup .",
    "second , the boundary conditions could be modified by including static walls parallel to the transport direction and different species of particles .",
    "that would allow one to explore the effect of confinement and entropic sorting of particles  @xcite .",
    "this could be compared with the case in which the wall is transversal to the applied field ( as in granular materials under gravity ) where layering phenomena near the wall and segregation effects have been observed  @xcite .",
    "third , it would be interesting to extend our approach to the case in which transport is induced by external particle reservoirs  @xcite .",
    "finally , one could modify our model by imposing velocity kinks randomly in space and time to the particles , the dynamics without the kinks obeying the same dynamical constraints as before : this would allow one to investigate the possible emergence of congested traffic motion in active fluids  @xcite .",

    "<S> complex fluids in shear flow and biased dynamics in crowded environments exhibit counterintuitive features which are difficult to address both at a theoretical level and by molecular dynamic simulations . to understand some of these features we study a schematic model of a highly viscous liquid , the two - dimensional kob - andersen kinetically constrained model , driven into non - equilibrium steady states by a uniform non - hamiltonian force . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed numerical analysis of the microscopic behavior of the model , including transversal and longitudinal spatial correlations and dynamic heterogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that at high particle density the transition from positive to negative resistance regimes in the current vs field relation can be explained via the emergence of nontrivial structures that intermittently trap the particles and slow down the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we relate such spatial structures to the current vs field relation in the different transport regimes . </S>"
