    "t tauri stars are thought to be young stars that are still accreting gas through a disk . @xcite",
    "discovered t tauri star kh 15d ( k7 v , @xmath2 pc ) , which shows an eclipse for 1/3 of its period , implying that it is obscured by faint circumstellar material rather than a stellar companion ; earlier data showed the star rebrighten at mid - eclipse , although this has weakened in recent data @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the obscuring material subtends a large angle , which may herald the presence a low mass stellar companion to shepherd the material via resonant interaction or to create a distorted disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , the duration of the eclipse trough is lengthening over time , changing from 16 days to 18 days over 5 years , and data from 50 - 90 years ago showed no evidence for eclipses @xcite , which means that the obscuring material is rapidly evolving . during eclipse , residual flux is still present at a level of @xmath31/20 of the flux outside of eclipse indicating that either ( a ) the obscuring material is porous ( covering factor is @xmath4 ) , ( b ) the eclipse is total , but scattered light `` fills in '' the eclipse , creating some residual flux , ( c ) some flux is scattered and some transmitted . the scattering interpretation may be favored as the star becomes slightly bluer during eclipse as one would expect from scattered light , although the fluctuations in color are comparable to the color difference @xcite . in addition , the equivalent width of h@xmath5 increases dramatically from 2    to @xmath6  indicating a change from an unobscured `` weak - line '' t tauri star to a classical t tauri star !    the eclipse provides a natural `` coronagraph '' during which the suppression of stellar light allows any scattering by surrounding material to become more prominent .",
    "we attempted to distinguish the above possibilities by carrying out spectropolarimetry inside and outside of the eclipse .",
    "since the unpolarized flux of the star dilutes the percentage of polarization , we expected that the percentage polarization due to scattered light would increase by a factor of at least 20 during the eclipse if the scattering material lies exterior to the occulting material and if the starlight is intrinsically unpolarized .",
    "this scenario is analogous to type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which are unobscured and show low polarization versus type 2 agn which are obscured and show much higher polarization @xcite .",
    "some t tauri stars show an anti - correlation between total flux and polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may be exaggerated in kh 15d as the flux variations are much more extreme . on the other hand ,",
    "if the residual flux is only due to incomplete coverage by the occulting material , then the polarization will not change .",
    "interstellar foreground polarization , which is measured to be 0.10.4% in the v - band for ngc 2264 @xcite , will not change during eclipse . before our observations , the optical polarization of kh 15d had not yet been measured , but during eclipse it shows the characteristics of classical t tauri stars which have a mean polarization of 1.2% with a standard deviation of 0.8% and maximum polarization of 2.5% @xcite .",
    "in  2 we summarize the spectropolarimetric observations , in  3 we give the results of the observations , in  4 we discuss the implications of these results for models of this t tauri star , and in  5 we review our conclusions .",
    "the primary observational goal was to measure the difference in polarization between eclipse and non - eclipse .",
    "outside eclipse , the star is sufficiently bright to observe at the palomar 200-inch telescope ( @xmath7 ) , but during the eclipse the star is a factor of @xmath8 fainter which required using keck to obtain a similar number of photons in a reasonable observing time .",
    "the palomar observations were taken with the double spectrograph spectropolarimeter @xcite , while the keck i observations were taken with the low resolution imaging spectrograph polarimeter @xcite . both instruments",
    "add dual - beam polarimetry optics to a double spectrograph incorporating dichroics to separate the blue and red beams .",
    "the observations and reductions were done using standard spectropolarimetry techniques @xcite .",
    "the observations of kh 15d were performed in sequences of four 15-minute exposures at four different positions of a rotating half - wave plate .",
    "each four - exposure sequence allows measurement of the stokes parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for each hour of observations , the position angle of the spectrograph slit",
    "was aligned with the parallactic angle for the midpoint of the hour .",
    "the instrumental setup is described in table 1 , while the observational summary is given in table 2 .",
    "null , polarized , and flux standards were observed during each night . since instrumental polarization can be present in the palomar 200-inch @xcite , we observed four null standards each at two perpendicular slit position angles .",
    "we used the measured polarization of the null standards as an estimate of the mean and uncertainty of the instrumental polarization , and we subtracted the mean instrumental stokes parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the measured stokes parameters of kh 15d to correct for the instrumental polarization . at palomar",
    "the instrumental polarization was found to be @xmath11% over @xmath12   and @xmath13% over @xmath14  . at keck",
    "the instrumental polarization was negligible , @xmath15% .",

    "the flux ratios differ between the bluest ( 4600 - 5600  ) and reddest ( 7000 - 8000  ) bands by only 1 @xmath18 , which is statistically consistent with no color change .",
    "the absolute value of the uneclipsed to eclipsed flux ratios are not to be trusted as the nights were not photometric , so we report only the ratio of each band to the 60007000   band . for comparison with the photometric data of @xcite we also computed synthetic photometry of our spectra which gave @xmath21 mag and @xmath22 mag during eclipse and @xmath23 mag outside of eclipse , which are in agreement with the range of values reported by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty on these colors to be @xmath24 mag as there appear to be differences between individual spectra on scales of @xmath25   which may be due to fluctuations in the flat - fields , difficulty of sky subtraction , overall systematic uncertainties in flux calibration , or other instrumental variations .",
    "there are a large number of stellar photospheric features which are seen in both spectra and are indicative of a k6v spectral type with @xmath26 k , somewhat hotter than the k7v type estimated by @xcite which may be due to the fact that our spectrum covers bluer wavelengths .",
    "almost all of these features show the same equivalent widths in both spectra , indicating that the eclipsed spectrum is a scaled version of the uneclipsed spectrum . we have measured the lick indices @xcite for both the eclipsed and uneclipsed spectra , plotted in figure 4 .",

    "the variation of the polarization between eclipse and non - eclipse indicates that the _ scattering region is not completely obscured by the occulting material_. if the occulter completely blocks all the light from the star , if the scattering is nearly isotropic , and if the scattering region is nearly spherically symmetric , then the residual flux , @xmath36% , indicates that the optical depth of the unobscured scattering material is @xmath37 .",
    "since the spectra inside and outside eclipse are consistent with no change in the spectral shape , and since the spectrum within eclipse is consistent with very weak wavelength dependence of the polarization , we conclude that the scattering mechanism is nearly achromatic , implying that the scatterers may be electrons or large grains .",
    "we discuss each of these possibilities in turn .",
    "if the scattering mechanism were electrons , then the low measured polarization of 2% indicates that the scattering region need be only slightly asymmetric .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite , the polarization caused by an axisymmetric thomson scattering envelope is @xmath38 , where @xmath5 is a `` shape factor '' which depends on the precise geometry of the scatterers .",
    "since the eclipsing region is likely in the equatorial plane of the circumstellar material , we can assume that @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 for @xmath41% . for a scattering geometry which consists of a slightly oblate or prolate spheroid of axis ratio @xmath42 ,",
    "then @xmath43 , so @xmath44 to create the observed polarization , i.e. only a 20% deviation from spherical symmetry is required to give the measured polarization . note that this example is simply illustrative since we have no preferred model for the scattering region .",
    "if we assume that all of the light during eclipse is due to electron scattering , then we can estimate the bound - free continuum emission expected from this gas .",
    "consider a nearly symmetric region of uniform electron density and temperature surrounding the star of size @xmath45 .",
    "we assume that the eclipsing material is located near the keplerian radius , @xmath46 , for a 48 day period .",
    "the low polarization implies that the electron scattering region must be at a larger radius , @xmath47 au to avoid becoming too asymmetric due to obscuration .",
    "since the material is nearly symmetric , the mean optical depth of the scattering region is @xmath48 , which implies an electron number density of @xmath49 @xmath50 ( assuming a uniform density ) .",
    "the bound - free emission expected at , say , 6000   must be less than @xmath51 erg @xmath32 s@xmath52 to avoid changing the strength of the lick indices . computing the emission from an optically - thin spherical region of plasma in lte , we find that @xmath53 k to be consistent with this upper limit . note that this is a strong lower limit since it is likely that the scattering region need be larger to give the small observed polarization .",
    "in addition , one can place a constraint on the temperature based on the strength of balmer line emission ; however , the interpretation is complicated by the unknown optical depth of the balmer lines .",
    "even so , the lower limit on the temperature based on the lack of detected bound - free emission is four times the virial temperature at @xmath46 , meaning that this gas would be strongly unbound and will outflow in less than a dynamical timescale , implying a mass loss rate of @xmath54 yr @xmath55 , which is rather large for a weak - line t tauri star .",
    "thus , it is more likely that the scattering is not due to electrons , but may be due to large dust grains , which we discuss next .",
    "if the scattering were due to dust , then the grain sizes would have to be fairly large to allow the weak wavelength dependence of the polarization _ and _ flux .",
    "this is true for the zodiacal light which reflects an optical spectrum that is identical to that of the sun @xcite .",
    "based on the achromaticity of the zodiacal scattering , the scatterers are thought to be large dust grains , 10 - 100 @xmath56 m in size , and there is further evidence that these grains might be quite `` fluffy '' ( i.e. low filling factor ) with densities as low as @xmath57 g @xmath50 .    for the estimation of the wavelength dependence of the scattering and polarization by dust particles we approximate the particles as spheres ( mie scattering ) and compute the polarized differential scattering cross section by single particles using a standard approach @xcite.swolf / miex - web / miex.htm - or contact the authors .",
    "] we have chosen the distribution of refractive indices of the materials from @xcite : 62.5% astronomical silicate and 37.5% graphite .",
    "since graphite is crystalline , it was considered as two `` different '' materials in the computation : the first with a refractive index as measured perpendicular to the crystal rotation axis , 25% , and the second parallel , 12.5% .",
    "we assumed that distribution of the dust size , @xmath58 , follows a power - law @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and derived the scattering properties of the ensemble of particle species and sizes ( * ? ? ? * wolf & voshchinnikov , in prep . ) .",
    "we averaged the scattered polarized flux over the entire @xmath61 steradians divided by the total scattered flux to estimate the mean polarization as a function of wavelength for each dust model .",
    "we then compared this to the relative wavelength dependence of the measured polarization ( the absolute polarization depends on the exact geometry of the scattering region , which is unknown ; see the next section for one particular model ) .",
    "we also compared the relative wavelength dependence of the scattered flux by dividing the eclipsed spectrum by the uneclipsed spectrum .",
    "given the assumptions that ( a ) the wavelength dependence of the flux and polarization does not depend on the geometry of the scatterers , and ( b ) the scatterers can be described by a single power - law , we can then place a constraint on the parameters of the dust model .",
    "we find that the lower limit , @xmath62 , does not change the fit much , so we simply vary @xmath63m@xmath64 m and @xmath65 .",
    "the minimum @xmath66 is 12 for 5 data points for @xmath67 m and @xmath68 , with the confidence contours plotted in figure 5 . at 90% confidence , @xmath69 and @xmath70m@xmath71 m , which indicates that the scattering is dominated by large dust grains .",
    "unfortunately , the minimum reduced @xmath72 , which is rather large .",
    "this is due to the fact that the measured polarization increases toward longer wavelengths , while the dust scattering models predict a polarization that is nearly constant , or slightly decreasing , with wavelength .",
    "the opacity of large dust grains scales as @xmath73 @xmath74 g@xmath55 , where @xmath75 m .",
    "thus , the eddington limit for the smaller of the large dust grains scales as @xmath76 erg s@xmath55 , which is similar to the luminosity of kh 15d , @xmath77 erg s@xmath55 .",
    "thus , smaller dust grains will be removed from the system by radiation forces . in addition",
    ", radiation forces on the larger grains may be significant enough to modify the structure of the system .",
    "@xcite have proposed a model for the occulter which consists of a semi - infinite edge crossing the star .",
    "this model is attractive as the finite size of the star and limb darkening can account for the shape of the ingress and egress , and , if the occulter is at the keplerian radius , then it must be inclined to the orbital plane by 15@xmath78 to give the correct duration of ingress and egress .",
    "however , we have found that the ingress and egress of the eclipse ( figure 1 , near phase of 0.3 and 0.7 ) show a more gradual rolloff than expected for a semi - infinite occulter .",
    "this can be fit with an optical depth of the occulter which scales with position as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the coordinate perpendicular to the edge of the occulter , which gives an excellent fit to the phased lightcurve data ( solid line in figure 1 ) .",
    "this material causing extinction will scatter as well , and in the case of large grains there will be significant forward scattering @xcite .",
    "in fact , this may account for the scattered flux present during the eclipse ; however , to compute the scattered light requires a knowledge of the three - dimensional distribution of scattering and occulting material , as well as a knowledge of the scattering properties .",
    "we construct such a model by assuming that ( a ) the occulter is located at the keplerian radius and ( b ) the 15@xmath78 tilt of the occulter is due to a warped disk .",
    "we model the material as a succession of tilted circular annuli , creating a warped disk , with the tilt angle given by @xmath81},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the radius of maximum tilt , @xmath83 is the maximum tilt , @xmath84 is the radius in the disk , and @xmath85 is the width of the tilted region , and we assume that the nodes of the warped annuli are aligned .",
    "the observer we place at an angle @xmath86 to the equatorial plane , and we rotate the warped disk as a solid body with a period equal to that of kh 15d . in addition , we cut the disk off at @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the opacity of the scattering material we distribute as @xmath89 ^ 2 $ ] , to produce the observed roll - off in intensity , where @xmath90 is the angular scale height , @xmath91 is the polar angle , and @xmath92 is a fiducial opacity . we find a good fit to the lightcurve for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 au ( this is the keplerian radius ) , @xmath97 .",
    "when taking into account only extinction , this distribution produces the solid lightcurve in figure 1 after the addition of 4.5% of the uneclipsed flux during eclipse .",
    "however , part of the extinction is due to scattering , so we also have computed the singly - scattered component of this density distribution assuming an albedo of unity and using the scattering function for zodiacal light derived by @xcite which is strongly forward scattering and has a maximum polarization of 22% .",
    "we find that the polarized flux of the scattered light during eclipse is 0.1% of the unobscured total flux , which is the same as the observed polarized flux during eclipse of kh 15d ( figure 6 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the appearance of the scattered light in this model at mid - eclipse ( an animated version of this figure which shows the appearance as a function of phase is available on - line ) .",
    "one prediction of this model is that the polarization angle should vary by @xmath98 during the eclipse .",
    "however , the total model flux during mid - eclipse is only 2.5% of the uneclipsed flux which is about half the observed mid - eclipse flux , indicating that there may be another component of scattered light which has low polarization , such as diffracted light , which is not taken into account in the model of @xcite , or back - scattered light . in a future study",
    "we may carry out more sophisticated modeling , varying the radius of the warp as well as the symmetry of the warp , and including multiple scattering and varying the dust grain model , to see how the scattered flux varies with dust composition and with wavelength of the observed light , and we will see whether diffraction , multiple - scattering , or back - scattering can explain the brightening at mid eclipse . there is evidence that the ingress and egress differ slightly in time between the even and odd eclipses , which may imply that the warp is an @xmath99 mode rather than @xmath100 as in our model .",
    "if so , the back warp will be partly eclipsed by the front warp , while the edges will be visible during mid - eclipse , which may explain the rebrightening .",
    "alternatively , the symmetry during mid - eclipse of the front warp may cause a brightening due to diffraction , which is likely to be wavelength dependent .",
    "if the albedo is less than unity , then mid - infrared observations may point toward an @xmath99 configuration if they also show a peak at mid - eclipse since the infrared light is emitted isotropically , similar to the back - scattered light .",
    "a summary of the results :    \\1 ) near mid - eclipse the polarization is @xmath32% , and is consistent with zero outside of eclipse ( 0.2@xmath190.2% ) .",
    "combined with other photometric data , the polarized flux near mid - eclipse is @xmath24% of the flux outside of eclipse .",
    "this indicates that there is an unobscured scattering region surrounding the t tauri star which creates the polarization ; the polarization can not be solely due to foreground transmission effects ( not associated with the star ) as there would no variation .",
    "\\2 ) the data are nearly consistent with no wavelength dependence of the polarization during eclipse .",
    "this indicates that the scatterers are approximately grey .",
    "in addition , electron scattering is unlikely to cause the observed polarization .",
    "\\3 ) the spectrum within the eclipse is consistent with being a scaled version of the spectrum outside of eclipse with no wavelength dependence of the ratio except for the presence of stronger emission lines which also argues for grey scattering ; rayleigh scattering is ruled out .",
    "our mie dust scattering model implies @xmath101 and @xmath70m@xmath71 m at 90% confidence ; however , the best fit model is not an adequate fit .",
    "\\4 ) the qualitative features of the eclipse can be reproduced by a model of a warped disk that orbits in front of the star , periodically eclipsing the star , having an extended atmosphere which causes a decrease in light before and after eclipse as well as scattered light within eclipse , which is consistent with the observed polarized flux .",
    "the polarization adds an extra clue that the eclipsing material completely occults the star since the maximum observed polarization of classical t tauri stars is @xmath102% @xcite and the kh 15d spectrum looks like that of a classical t tauri star during eclipse .",
    "this adds to the evidence that the eclipse is complete based on ( a ) the steep egress and ingress ; ( b ) the flat bottom of the trough of the eclipse ; ( c ) the fine tuning that would be required to arrange 95% covering .",
    "it is interesting that the trough of the eclipse does show some slight variations , namely an increase near mid - eclipse , which may indicate that the scattering region is partially eclipsed and this eclipse varies with time .",
    "it would be interesting to measure the polarization as a function of time within the eclipse to look for variation .",
    "we have modeled the eclipse with a warped disk since a discrete cloud would be sheared in ten orbits , while the eclipses have repeated with similar durations for @xmath3 50 orbits . however , this does not mean that the warped disk model is without its own problems : if the warped model is correct , what drives the warp at such a short period ?",
    "the interaction of the stellar magnetosphere is proposed to cause a similar occulting behavior in the t tauri star aa tauri @xcite ; however , this star has a much short period between occultations , 8 days , while the longer period of kh 15d is much longer than the spin period of any known t tauri star .",
    "one can place a lower limit on the warp radius of @xmath103 since inwards of this radius the warp would have to be at @xmath104 to create the correct duration of ingress due to the finite size of the star . at @xmath105 , the keplerian period is 0.8 days , while a warp precession timescale is typically much longer than the keplerian timescale",
    ". it may be that a planet excites a wave in the disk @xcite or that an elongated dusty vortex causes obscuration @xcite ; each of these models might be consistent with the observed polarization profile , which remains to be quantified with a scattering calculation similar to the one presented here .",
    "future observations of interest would be to ( 1 ) measure the magnitude and angle of polarization throughout ingress and/or egress to test the warp model ; ( 2 ) measure the polarization at higher spectral resolution within the h@xmath5 emission line to see whether it is unpolarized ; ( 3 ) look for variations of the flux during eclipse to determine whether the stellar variability is washed out by the time delays from scattering ( although this requires a rather extended scattering region ) .",
    "in addition , near- and mid - infrared observations may show fluctuations if the occulting region has a warped geometry , as we have suggested .",

    "<S> kh 15d is a strongly variable t tauri star in the young star cluster ngc 2264 that shows a decrease in flux of 3.5 magnitudes lasting for 18 days and repeating every 48 days . </S>",
    "<S> the eclipsing material is likely due to orbiting dust or rocky bodies in a partial ring or warped disk that periodically occults the star . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the polarized spectrum in and out of eclipse at the keck and palomar observatories . </S>",
    "<S> outside of the eclipse , the star exhibited low polarization consistent with zero . during eclipse , </S>",
    "<S> the polarization increased dramatically to @xmath0% across the optical spectrum , while the spectrum had the same continuum shape as outside of eclipse and exhibited emission lines of much larger equivalent width , as previously seen . from the data , we conclude that ( a ) the scattering region is uneclipsed ; ( b ) the scattering is nearly achromatic ; ( c ) the star is likely completely eclipsed so that the flux during eclipse is entirely due to scattered light , a conclusion also argued for by the shape of the ingress and egress . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the scattering is not due to electrons , but may be due to large dust grains of size @xmath1 m , similar to the interplanetary grains which scatter the zodiacal light . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a warped - disk model with an extended dusty atmosphere which reproduces the main features of the lightcurve , namely ( a ) a gradual decrease before ingress due to extinction in the atmosphere ( similar for egress ) ; ( b ) a sharper decrease within ingress due to the optically - thick base of the atmosphere ; ( c ) a polarized flux during eclipse which is 0.1% of the total flux outside of eclipse , which requires no fine - tuning of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the inclination of the warp is set by the duration of ingress and egress assuming that the warp is located at the keplerian radius , and the inclination of the observer is then determined by the duration of the eclipse . </S>"
