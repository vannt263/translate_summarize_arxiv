    "in classical analysis , peano curves are usually thought of as curiosities .",
    "it is exciting and counterintuitive that they exist , but they are not useful for solving problems . the purpose of this paper is to show that in fractal analysis , in contrast , peano curves may play an important role in constructing laplacians and studying their properties .",
    "in fact , this approach has already been used to construct laplacians on julia sets of complex polynomials @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a compact topological space , we will use the term peano curve for any continuous mapping @xmath2 from the circle ( parameterized by @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath4 ) onto @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath2 can not be one - to - one ( except in the trivial case in which @xmath1 is homeomorphic to a circle ) , so there must be values in @xmath5 $ ] that are mapped to the same point in @xmath1 , say @xmath6 .",
    "we will say that such @xmath7 and @xmath8 are identified and write @xmath9 .",
    "if we consider all possible identifications , then we obtain a model of @xmath1 as a circle with identifications , exactly the point of view adopted in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .. typically the number of identifications will be uncountable . our goal is to obtain a countable sequence of identifications that is appropriately dense in the set of all identifications , so that if we take an initial segment of identifications , we will obtain a useful approximation for @xmath1 .    in the case of julia sets ,",
    "the peano curve is defined by means of applying the riemann mapping theorem to the component of infinity of the complement of the julia set . despite this rather abstract construction , it turned out that it was possible to find a useful sequence of identified points . in this paper ,",
    "peano curves will be given as a limit of a sequence of curves defined by a self - similar type iteration scheme , and the self - intersections of the approximating curves will give us the sequence of identifications of the limiting peano curve .",
    "it is interesting to note that many of the examples of peano curves to planar domains that are found in textbooks are also constructed as limits of simpler curves obtained by iterating some self - similar scheme , but the approximating curves have no self - intersections . from our point of view",
    "this is a rather silly choice .",
    "given a finite set of identifications on the circle , we have a natural graph structure where the identified points are the vertices , and the edges join consecutive points around the circle . if we assign positive weights @xmath10 to the points , thought of as a discrete measure on the set of vertices , and non - negative weights @xmath11 to the edges , thought of as conductances on an electrical network associated to the graph , then we may define a graph laplacian    @xmath12    where the sum is taken over all @xmath13 neighboring @xmath14 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we may take @xmath15 if @xmath14 and @xmath13 are not connected by an edge .",
    "notice that self - edges are possible if @xmath14 and @xmath13 are identified neighboring points , but they do not contribute to the laplacian .",
    "we want the discrete measures on the approximating graphs to converge to some natural measure on @xmath1 . in all the examples considered here",
    ", we will use the simple choice of taking @xmath16 where the sum is taken over all points in the set of identified points denoted by @xmath14 . for the conductances ,",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath17 , so the length of the interval @xmath18 $ ] is taken to be the resistance in the electrical network .",
    "this is not always the optimal choice , however , as is apparent in the previous work on julia sets .",
    "in particular we will make a more sophisticated choice for one of our examples , the pentagasket . in order to obtain a laplacian on @xmath1 in the limit it will be necessary to renormalize the sequence of laplacians on the approximating graphs , and",
    "this becomes a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "in this paper we will look at five examples of self - similar sets @xmath1 with carefully chosen peano curves .",
    "only three of them are fractal .",
    "the nonfractal sets are the equilateral triangle @xmath19 with neumann boundary conditions , and the square torus @xmath20 . these may be regarded as `` controls , '' since we know exactly what the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian are .",
    "we can then see how well the peano curves reproduce the known results .",
    "it would of course be silly to claim that this is an optimal way to develop properties of the usual planar laplacian ; however we will show that it reveals some insights into the eigenfunctions to view them as functions on the circle pulled back via the peano curves .",
    "the first fractal example we consider is the pentagasket , pg ( figure 1.1 ) .",
    "it is a highly symmetric example of kigami s class of postcritically finite ( pcf ) self - similar sets @xcite @xcite .",
    "it has a fully symmetric self - similar laplacian , whose properties were studied in detail in @xcite . since it does not satisfy spectral decimation , many of these properties have only been observed experimentally .",
    "we construct a peano curve that yields a slightly different sequence of graph approximations than was considered in @xcite . by following the outline from the work on julia sets",
    ", we are able to find the correct renormalization constant and give an independent construction of the laplacian , together with numerical results fully consistent with those in @xcite . in this sense , the case of pg may also be considered a `` control . ''",
    "the second fractal example is the octagasket , og ( figure 1.2 ) .",
    "this fractal is not pcf , and in fact there is no proof yet of the existence of a symmetric self - similar laplacian on og .",
    "nevertheless , experimental evidence of the existence of a laplacian and properties of the spectrum using the method of `` outer approximation '' was presented in @xcite .",
    "our peano curve approach gives independent experimental evidence for the existence of the laplacian with data that is consistent with @xcite .",
    "what is more , we are able to give concrete conjectures concerning the structure of the spectrum ; for example , we find precise locations in the spectrum for spectral gaps that were noticed in @xcite .",
    "the existence of spectral gaps is still quite a mystery .",
    "it is possible to prove existence for pcf fractals that enjoy spectral decimation , but the proof is just technical and yields no  ideological \" explanation for them .",
    "the significance of spectral gaps is pointed out forcefully in @xcite .",
    "the third fractal example we consider is the magic carpet mc , recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "this fractal is obtained by modifying the construction of the sierpinski carpet sc ( figure 1.3 ) to immediately sew up all cuts that are made , as illustrated in figure 1.4 .",
    "thus mc is a limit of closed surfaces , and geometrically these surfaces are flat everywhere with the exception of a finite number of point singularities carrying negative curvature .",
    "again , there is no proof of the existence of a symmetric self - similar laplacian on mc , but the results in this paper together with @xcite give strong experimental evidence .",
    "the evidence suggests that analysis on mc should be similar to euclidean spaces of dimension exceeding two , with points having zero capacity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give descriptions of all the peano curves , as limits of piecewise linear maps obtained recursively using specified substitution rules .",
    "we are not claiming that these are the unique curves , or even that they are optimal in any sense .    in section 3",
    "we discuss the example of pg .",
    "we describe the method of creating graph approximations and associated graph laplacians from the peano curve , and relate this to the laplacian constructed by kigami @xcite(see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we use the same method for the other examples , the octagasket ( section 4 ) , the magic carpet ( section 5 ) , and the torus and triangle ( section 6 ) . the existence of the laplacian in the limit for og and mc has not yet been established , and we do no see any way to use the peano curve construction to resolve this problem . for the torus and the triangle the laplacian and its spectrum",
    "are well known .",
    "the graphs of the eigenfunctions pulled back to the circle via the peano curve for the triangle are new and appealing .",
    "we have not attempted to obtain higher order accuracy in approximating eigenvalues by using more sophisticated numerical methods , such as the finite element method .",
    "it should not be difficult to adopt such methods to our examples , if so desired .",
    "we include many numerical results , such as tables of eigenvalues and graphs of eigenfunctions .",
    "the reader should see the website _",
    "@xmath21 dmolitor _ for more data .",
    "this paper should be regarded as a `` proof of concept '' paper , showing by example that the method of peano curves can be an effective tool in studying analysis on fractals .",
    "we hope it will prove useful for other fractals .",
    "all the peano curves we consider are limits of piecewise linear maps @xmath22 , where the passage from @xmath22 to @xmath23 is given by a set of substitution rules for replacing each linear segment of @xmath22 by a union of consecutive segments of @xmath23 with the same endpoints . to make this clear we start by describing a peano curve whose image is the sierpinski gasket ( sg , figure 2.1 ) .",
    "we will not discuss this example in detail below because it gives rise to exactly the same approximations to the laplacian on sg as initially constructed by kigami @xcite @xcite .",
    "the first approximation @xmath24 simply traces out an equilateral triangle at constant speed .",
    "the substitution rules are shown in figure 2.2 .",
    "each linear segment traces out an interval in one of the three orientations of the sides of the triangle .",
    "each segment of @xmath22 is parameterized by an interval @xmath25 $ ] and is shown as a dotted line in the figure .",
    "it s replacement , three intervals parameterized by @xmath26,\\ \\left[\\frac{3k+1}{3^{m+2}},\\frac{3k+2}{3^{m+2}}\\right],\\ \\left[\\frac{3k+2}{3^{m+2}},\\frac{3k+3}{3^{m+2}}\\right]$ ] traces out the solid lines , with the same direction as the dotted line .",

    "+ a.     + b.     + c.    note that @xmath31 etc .",
    ", so the value of the limiting curve @xmath2 at a value @xmath32 is the same as for all @xmath33 with @xmath34 . for a generic value of @xmath35 , however , it is not so obvious what the point @xmath36 on sg is exactly . in figure 2.4 ,",
    "+ a.     + b.    we show the identifications on the circle for the curves @xmath37 and @xmath28 .",
    "these identifications persist for the limit curve @xmath2 and all identifications arising from @xmath2 are limits of those produced by @xmath22 as @xmath38 , although it is not at all obvious what these are .",
    "to indicate the complexity of this simple example , we ask the question : what is the image of @xmath39\\right)$ ] , the first third of the circle ?",
    "figure 2.5    shows @xmath40\\right)$ ] , which suggests @xmath41\\right)=sg$ ] .",
    "it is in fact easy to prove this , since @xmath42\\right)$ ] satisfies a self - similar identity which uniquely characterizes sg .",
    "thus the restriction of @xmath2 to @xmath41\\right)\\ \\left(\\text{or } \\left[\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3}\\right ] \\text { or } \\left[\\frac{2}{3},1\\right]\\right)$ ] is another peano curve describing sg .",
    "why did we not use this peano curve to start with ?",
    "there are two reasons : 1 ) the peano curve destroys the dihedral-3 symmetry , 2 ) the approximations have no self - intersections .",
    "( if we were interested in creating a peano curve from @xmath43 to an infinite blow up of sg we would use these curves as the building blocks . ) but this observation has the simple consequence that the original peano curve @xmath2 must pass through each point ( with the exception of the three vertices of the original triangle ) at least three times , once for each third of the circle .",
    "of course the smaller curves must have self - intersections as well , so there must certainly be some equivalence classes of identified points with four elements .",
    "nevertheless , the approximating curves only produce equivalence classes with two elements .",
    "there are many interesting questions about the size of equivalence classes that we are not able to answer ; are there infinite equivalence classes ?",
    "if not , is there a maximal size ?",
    "what is the size of a `` typical '' equivalence class ?",
    "what is the complete equivalence class of the junction points @xmath32 ? despite the vexing nature of these unanswered questions , the identifications from the approximating curves @xmath22 give a perfect picture of the laplacian on sg . in this case , what you do not know does not hurt you .",
    "the next peano curve we describe maps to the pentagasket ( pg ) .",
    "the first level approximation @xmath37 traces out a five - sided star .",
    "we think of this as consisting of five line segments , but because of the intersections , each segment consists of three pieces . we choose to traverse the pieces at different speeds , faster on the longer end pieces and slower on the short middle piece , so that the arrival times will be consistent from level to level . in general",
    ", the identified points for @xmath22 will be of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "figure 2.6 shows @xmath37 and @xmath28 @xmath47 .",
    "the substitution rule is illustrated in figure 2.7 and is the same for all five rotations of the original dotted line .",
    "+ a.     + b.    in figure 2.8 we show the identifications on the circle arising from @xmath37 and @xmath28 .",
    "we include the unidentified points of the form @xmath44 , with @xmath48 as these are turning points for the curves and we will use these in forming the approximating graphs and associated laplacians .",
    "we see that there are two distinct types of edges in the graph of length @xmath49 and @xmath50 and we will assign different conductances to the two types .",
    "all equivalence classes of identified points consist of pairs and identifications persist from level to level . in this case",
    "we note that the image of one fifth of the circle is not all of pg , but rather a smaller self - similar set defined by an iterated function system of five similarities with a smaller contraction ration and a different set of fixed points ( see figure 2.9 ) .",
    "next we describe the peano curve for og .",
    "we begin with @xmath24 that traces around an octagon clockwise and then turns around and traces around counterclockwise .",
    "the substitution rule is shown in figure 2.10 .",
    "note that the direction of the edge is significant .",
    "for @xmath22 the identified points are of the form @xmath51 .",
    "some equivalence classes have two points , and we call these _ outer points _ , while others have four points and we call these _ inner points_. figure 2.11    shows @xmath24 and @xmath37 . figure 2.12     + a.     + b.    shows the identifications of outer and inner points from @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the restriction of @xmath2 to the interval @xmath52 $ ] maps onto og , but it destroys the symmetry and fails to give the full set of identifications .",

    "we show both the symbolic description of @xmath37 and the actual path , which has a single jump discontinuity at @xmath56 .",

    "we may obtain functions that have period @xmath171 or @xmath172 .",
    "all these periods are immediately apparent from the graphs , shown in figure 6.2 .",
    "but we can say much more precisely where these periods occur .",
    "the neumann spectrum of @xmath131 is well - known .",
    "suppose the triangle has side length 1 and corners at @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "for every pair @xmath175 of non - negative integers define @xmath176 @xmath177 +   + where @xmath178 then @xmath179 is a neumann eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath180 , and these are the only ones .",
    "note that when @xmath181 we obtain an eigenspace of multiplicity one , and for @xmath141 the functions @xmath179 and @xmath182 span an eigenspace of multiplicity two .",
    "coincidences where @xmath183 may lead to higher multiplicities , but this does not change the narrative substantially .                  the @xmath181 multiplicity one space transforms according to the @xmath191 representation ( symmetric with respect to reflections ) and the formula simplifies to @xmath192 , and so @xmath193 also transforms according to the @xmath191 representation and has period @xmath172 .",
    "this is seen in @xmath194 corresponding to@xmath195 and @xmath196 @xmath197 .",
    "when @xmath141 and both are odd then the multiplicity two space transforms according to the 2 representation and has no periodicity .",
    "when @xmath198 is even and @xmath199 is odd , then there are two cases : unless @xmath200 , it is again the 2 representation , seen in @xmath201 @xmath202 @xmath203 @xmath204,but if @xmath200 then the space breaks up into a direct sum of a @xmath191 and a @xmath205 representation , and both have period @xmath163 , seen in @xmath206 @xmath207 . in fact , taking the sum and difference of ( 6.4 ) for @xmath208 and @xmath209 yields the formulas @xmath210 for the @xmath191 function and @xmath211 for the @xmath205 function . finally ,",
    "if @xmath198 and @xmath199 are both even with @xmath212 with at least one of @xmath213 odd , then the space is the @xmath214-fold iterated miniaturization of the @xmath215 space , with the same representations and the period multiplied by @xmath171 .",
    "these behaviors are seen in @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath202 @xmath218 @xmath219 and @xmath216 @xmath220 @xmath202 @xmath221 @xmath222 ."
