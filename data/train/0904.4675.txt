    "[ intro ]    one of the most important classes of quantities calculated in quantum field theory is that of the on - shell scattering amplitudes . in fact , the knowledge of the scattering matrix completely specifies the theory , perturbatively .",
    "moreover , scattering amplitudes of gauge theories frequently exhibit structures and symmetries which are not at all apparent from the lagrangian formulation of the system .",
    "one such example is the maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) tree level amplitudes of an arbitrary number of gluons @xcite .",
    "another example is the iterative structure of the multi - loop mhv scattering amplitudes in the planar maximally super - symmetric yang - mills theory ( @xmath6 sym ) .",
    "such a structure was first observed in @xcite for the case of the four gluon planar amplitude at two loops . in the same parer ,",
    "it was conjectured that this iterative structure may also hold for an arbitrary number of gluons .",
    "subsequently , an explicit calculation of the four gluon amplitude at three loops led the authors of @xcite to propose a conjecture for the all - loop expression of the n - point mhv amplitude . from the work of @xcite",
    ", it is known that the soft and collinear singularities of any gauge theory amplitude exponentiate .",
    "what is remarkable about the conjecture of @xcite is that also the finite part of the amplitude , properly defined , does exponentiate .",
    "since the conjecture of @xcite is an all - loop one , it should also be valid in the strong coupling regime , @xmath7 , and can thus be tested by using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "however , the objects which naturally occur in a conformal field theory are gauge invariant operators and their correlation functions and not the scattering amplitudes .    in a remarkable paper ,",
    "the authors of @xcite gave a prescription of how to calculate scattering amplitudes in the context of ads / cft .",
    "in particular , in order to simplify the boundary conditions of the problem , they performed a t - duality in four of the directions of the ads space . as a result , it became evident that the calculation of the scattering amplitude is equivalent to the vacuum expectation value of polygonal wilson loop whose contour is comprised of light - like segments , each segment corresponding to the momentum of a scattered gluon . using this approach , they succeeded in finding the minimal surface for the case of a loop with four segments which corresponds to the logarithm of the four gluon amplitude at strong coupling .",
    "the expression they obtained is in agreement with the conjecture put forward in @xcite , when one takes into account the value of the cusp anomalous dimension at strong coupling .",
    "the aforementioned equivalence of the amplitude and the expectation value of the wilson loop , although justified only at strong coupling , suggests that the same duality may hold at weak coupling too , order by order in perturbation theory . that this is true at the one loop level",
    "was confirmed in @xcite for the four gluon amplitude and in @xcite for the n - gluon amplitude .",
    "subsequently , the authors of @xcite were able to confirm this conjecture by computing the expectation value of the wilson loops with four and five legs at two loops .    in the meanwhile",
    ", some doubt was cast on the validity of the bds conjecture beyond one loop and for amplitudes with six gluons or more @xcite , @xcite . on the wilson loop side , an important development was the derivation of the anomalous conformal ward identities which the wilson loop obeys @xcite . by exploiting these identities it became apparent that the bds conjecture is correct and agrees with the wilson loop picture for four and five particles .",
    "however , for amplitudes with more than five gluons , one can construct conformally invariant cross ratios . as a consequence",
    ", one can add any function of these cross ratios to the bds ansatz and still have the conformal ward identities satisfied .",
    "this function which encodes the deviation from the bds conjecture is termed as the finite remainder @xmath1 .",
    "the authors of @xcite calculated the remainder of the two loop six - edged wilson loop numerically , and found that it is different from zero . in a parallel development , the corresponding two",
    "loop six gluon mhv amplitude was calculated and it was directly verified that the bds ansatz has to be modified @xcite . the comparison of these results @xcite , @xcite shows that the parity even finite part of the mhv amplitude and the wilson loop are in agreement ( up to a constant ) for six particles at two loops .",
    "as was , briefly , discussed above the wilson loops obey conformal ward identities which constrain to a great extent their expectation values .",
    "the conformal symmetry related to these ward identities is not the conformal symmetry of the original space where the gluons live and scatter .",
    "it is a symmetry of a dual space where the wilson loops live , and at strong coupling this space is the boundary of the ads space obtained after the t - dualities are performed .",
    "the nature of this symmetry , as well as its connection to integrability were clarified in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the wilson loop / amplitude duality suggests that the tree level scattering matrix of the @xmath6 theory could possess a dual supersymmetrised version of the dual conformal theory .",
    "this was proved and further studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the relation between null wilson loops with a self - crossing and their corresponding amplitudes .",
    "one important aspect of our analysis is that the kinematics of self - intersecting wilson loops are in the minkowskian region .",
    "firstly , we compute the one loop contribution to the expectation value of a self - intersecting loop .",
    "this computation shows that the wilson loop develops an additional @xmath0 pole associated to the intersection .",
    "the wilson loop / amplitude conjecture indicates that the same @xmath0 singularity should appear at the corresponding amplitude .",
    "we verify this by examining the finite part of the one - loop amplitude at the corresponding kinematic limit .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the behaviour of the finite remainder function @xmath1 . for the case of regular polygons",
    "was studied in @xcite .",
    "] by exploiting the renormalisation group equations which govern the dependence of the wilson loops on the renormalisation scale @xmath8 we argue that the remainder function @xmath9 explodes in the imaginary direction when approaching the self - intersecting wilson loop .",
    "this is similar to what happens at one loop , where the finite part of the amplitude also diverges , and suggests that @xmath1 has a branch cut in the negative @xmath5 axis when the other two ratios are approximately equal @xmath3 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the kinematics of a wilson loop with a self crossing . in section 3",
    ", we compute the one loop contribution of the crossing to the expectation value of a self - intersecting wilson loop and compare with the the corresponding one loop amplitude . in section 4 , we derive the renormalisation group equations relevant for the self - intersecting null wilson loop and its implications for the remainder function @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we comment on the results of the two previous sections .",
    "[ kinematics ]    as a first step , we derive some useful relations for the kinematic configuration of a self - intersecting wilson loop ( see figure 1 ) . by translational invariance",
    "one can choose the intersection point to be at zero .",
    "we also denote the momenta of the intersecting gluons by @xmath10 and @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the fractions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 from zero to @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the sum of the momenta from the tip of @xmath15 to the beginning of @xmath14 while @xmath19 is the corresponding sum from the tip of @xmath14 to the beginning of @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath20 momentum conservation for the upper half of the loop gives : @xmath21 similarly , for the lower half of the loop it gives : @xmath22 by dotting with @xmath14 we get : @xmath23 while by dotting with @xmath15 we get : @xmath24 similarly from it is easy to obtain : @xmath25 and @xmath26 furthermore , and can be solved with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19 and squared to give : @xmath27 @xmath28 finally , with the help of , and , we get : @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . by using",
    "the equations listed above it is straightforward to verify that : @xmath31 this is one of the key relations of this section . in what follows",
    "we will also need the relation : @xmath32    before going on , let us elaborate on the kinematics of the loop appearing in figure 1 .",
    "the first thing one can observe is that the value of the loop depends on six independent lorentz invariant variables .",
    "one way to see this is as follows : the two momentum conservation relations @xmath33 and @xmath34 allow us to express two of the momenta , say @xmath35 and @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we are left with four independent momenta plus the pair @xmath39 . from the four independent momenta",
    "one can build six lorentz invariant combinations @xmath40 .",
    "however , one should remember to impose the conditions that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are massless .",
    "these conditions @xmath41 and @xmath42 supply two relations between the six lorentz invariant combinations mentioned above . as a consequence ,",
    "one has 4 lorentz invariants plus @xmath38 which makes six invariants in total .    in what follows ,",
    "we express the nine variables appearing in a six - edged wilson loop in terms of six quantities : @xmath43 where @xmath44 let us mention that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the invariants of the loops @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "using the relations in one can deduce the values of the three cross ratios in terms of six independent quantities @xmath49 .",
    "these read : @xmath50 thus , we see that for the loop shown in figure 1 there is only one free cross ratio , since 2 of them are equal @xmath51 and the third is equal to one , @xmath52 .     of the wilson loop",
    "@xmath53 $ ] while diagram 1b depicts the contour @xmath54 of the wilson loop @xmath55 .",
    "the relation between the external gluon momenta and the @xmath12-coordinates is @xmath56 .",
    "the wiggly lines denote gluon propagators .",
    "diagram 1a gives a contribution to the one loop value of the wilson loop with a self crossing.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "in this section , we calculate the one loop corrections to the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop depicted in figure 1a . in @xmath6 sym the form of this operator is given by @xcite : [ wil ] w(c )  tr  , where @xmath57 is the usual path - order symbol and @xmath58 and @xmath59 parametrise the loop @xmath60 .",
    "it is possible , if one wishes , to include the fermions and use additional functions of @xmath61 needed to parametrise the trajectory of a particle in superspace . in",
    "what follows , we focus on bosonic loops by setting all these functions to zero .",
    "in addition we set @xmath62 . as a result ,",
    "the wilson loop is locally supersymmetric @xmath63 only if @xmath64 . for the configurations of figure 1",
    "this is true since the segments building the loop are null .",
    "effectively , what we are left with is the form of the wilson operator in qcd .",
    "the properties of these operators are well - studied @xcite .",
    "it is known that the expectation value of a smooth loop without any intersection is finite when expressed in terms of the renormalised parameters @xcite .",
    "if the loop is not smooth , but has one or more cusps , then it is no longer finite since additional ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences make their appearance .",
    "however , it can be shown that the divergences can be renormalised multiplicatively ( as long as there are no cusps that lie on the light cone ) @xcite .",
    "the situation is more intricate when the loop intersects itself . in this case , the loop functions belonging to the set of loops which are the same as the original loop except at the crossing points mix with each other under renormalisation promoting the renormalisation constant @xmath65 to a matrix @xcite .",
    "for example , the two configurations appearing in figure 1 mix under renormalisation .",
    "let us note , that intersecting wilson loops are important since it is precicely these configurations which give the quantum corrections to the migdal - makeenko loop equations @xcite .",
    "as soon as one considers self - intersecting loops which are built from null segments an apparent puzzle arises .",
    "as we will show in the rest of this section , the wilson loop of figure 1 has an @xmath0 singularity associated to the crossing .",
    "the direct connection between the wilson loop and the corresponding gluon amplitude , discussed in the introduction , implies that the amplitude should also have the same @xmath0 pole .",
    "but the ir singularities of the amplitudes are well - known . at large @xmath66",
    "they come from the exponentiation of the soft and collinear singularities and due to planarity the involve only two particle invariants of adjacent gluons @xcite .",
    "since , as we will shortly see , the wilson loop uv singularity depends on @xmath67 it seems that there is a disagreement between the two quantities .",
    "we will discuss the resolution of this puzzle at the end of this section .",
    "next , we proceed to the one loop correction to the wilson loop of figure 1a . as discussed in @xcite",
    "there are two types of non - vanishing diagrams . in the first one ,",
    "a gluon joins two adjacent segments meeting at a cusp .",
    "this kind of diagrams give the anticipated @xmath68 pole when both ends of the gluon approach the cusp .",
    "the second type consists of those diagrams where the gluon stretches between two non - adjacent segments .",
    "generically , this class of diagrams gives a finite contribution even when evaluated in four dimensions .",
    "our calculation is similar to the one of @xcite except that now one has to be careful when the gluon is exchanged between the lines carrying momentum @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in this case",
    "one can split the integral in four pieces accounting for the four different ways in which the gluon can be exchanged .",
    "to start , we parametrise the crossing lines as [ param ] x(_p)=x_5+_p p + x(_q)=x_2+_q q , where @xmath69",
    ". implies that [ x - x ] x(_p)-x(_q)=x_5-x_2+_p p-_q q = p+q+_p p-_q q. one can now define the new variables @xmath70 and @xmath71 and use momentum conservation to rewrite as [ x - xf ] x(_p)-x(_q)=-b q - a p. it is now straightforward to evaluate the integral in @xmath72 dimensions .",
    "an important comment is in order .",
    "the propagator we are using is : [ prop ] _ ( x)=- ( 1- ) .",
    "notice that the prescription for avoiding the poles of the feynman propagator is opposite to that in configuration space and opposite to that of @xcite .",
    "this is because only then the analytic properties of the divergent part of the amplitude as obtained from the 2 mass easy box integral are the same as the analytic properties of the expression obtained from a cusp in the wilson loop calculation .",
    "namely , both should behave as : -()^. somehow , the prescription in is natural to impose , since the wilson loop actually lives in momentum space .",
    "the finite part of the wilson loop expectation value originating from a gluon exchange between the crossing momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 is :    [ int ] f_= _ 0 ^ 1 d_p_0 ^ 1 d_q + = _ -(1-x)^x da _ -(1-y)^y db .",
    "notice that we have kept explicitly the prescription for the feynman propagator .",
    "then the integral becomes : [ int2 ] f_= & & without loss of generality one can assume that @xmath73 .",
    "the expansion in @xmath74 of the square bracket in gives [ square ] ( -2i)+^2(^2(-s_pqxy - i0)+ ^2(-s_pq(1-x)(1-y)-i0 ) + -^2(s_pqx(1-y)-i0)-^2(s_pqy(1-x)-i0 ) ) + ( ^3 ) .",
    "in all the manipulations above we have put the branch cut of the logarithm on the negative real axis .",
    "using our result becomes [ intfin ] f_&= & ( i ) -(^2(-s_pqxy - i0)+ ^2(- s_pq(1-x)(1-y)-i0 ) + & & -^2(s_pqx(1-y)-i0)-^2(s_pqy(1-x)-i0 ) ) + ( ) .",
    "we now turn to the puzzle mentioned earlier in this section .",
    "it is well - known that the complete one loop amplitude is expressed as a sum of two - mass easy box functions , all having coefficient equal to one @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although each box function contains poles in @xmath74 whose coefficient depends on multi - particle invariants , it happens that after performing the sum of all the two - mass easy box functions the infrared divergent terms involve only two particle invariants of adjacent particles .",
    "however , our expression for the wilson loop contains a pole that depends on the invariant of two non - adjacent gluons , apparently not present in the amplitude .",
    "the resolution of this puzzle is the following .",
    "the finite part of the two mass easy box whose massless legs are @xmath14 and @xmath15 has a @xmath0 pole identical to this of .",
    "this can be seen by writing the all orders in @xmath74 expression for the finite part , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "this reads : [ allorders ] & & f^2me ( s , t , p^2 , q^2 ) = -  , where [ c ] c=. by looking at , it is immediate to see that @xmath75 as one approaches the crossing configuration .. ] by taking into account that @xmath76 and @xmath77 one can multiply by @xmath78 and take its limit as @xmath75 to obtain , the @xmath8 appearing in the wilson loop calculation can be redefined as @xmath79 ( see @xcite ) to absorb part of the gamma function and a factor of @xmath80 which are present in . after this redefinition",
    "the two expressions agree up to order @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath82 appearing in is related to the dimensional regularisation scale @xmath83 used in the calculation of the amplitude by @xmath84 since in this limit the hypergeometric functions become one .",
    "furthermore , it is not difficult to verify that all the other finite contributions originating from the gluon exchange between two non - adjacent segments do remain finite .",
    "it is instructive to consider the behaviour of the finite part by first setting @xmath74 to zero and then approach the crossing configuration . in this case the finite part reads @xcite : [ e=0 ] f_=0=(-li_2(1-c ( s+i0))-li_2(1-c ( t+i0))+li_2(1-c ( p^2+i0 ) ) + + li_2(1-c ( q^2+i0 ) ) ) . in the limit @xmath75 one can use the identity [ i d ] li_2(1-x)+li_2(1-x^-1)+^2(x)=0 to obtain [ app ] li_2(1-c ( s+i0))=-^2(c(s+i0))- . employing we can rewrite as [ e=0app ] f_=0=(^2(c(s+i0))+^2(c(t+i0 ) ) -^2(c(p^2+i0))-^2(c(q^2+i0 ) ) ) .",

    "it is amusing to notice that is what one has in .",
    "see also footnote [ foot ] . ] after the identification @xmath87 which implies @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , it is natural to expect this relation since one is dealing with logarithmic singularities .",
    "one can view the situation where @xmath89 as another way to regularise the crossing singularity .",
    "this can be seen by considering the simple case where the crossing singularity is regularised by separating the two gluon momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 by a space - like distance @xmath90 satisfying @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in this case",
    ", one can parametrise the momenta by @xmath93 where @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "it is then straightforward to evaluate @xmath95 and @xmath96 from which one deduces that @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to calculate the gluon exchange integral of the aforementioned configuration whose @xmath90 limit has the leading behaviour @xmath98 in agreement with",
    ".    it will be useful , in what follows , to notice that one can split @xmath99 in two pieces , one depending on the conformal ratio @xmath5 only and another which is not a function of the cross ratios .",
    "namely , [ cu ] ( -c)=(()-(1-u_2 ) ) .    in the next section",
    "we derive the renormalisation group equations obeyed by null cusped wilson loops with a self - crossing and discuss their implications for the two loop remainder function @xmath9 .",
    "as was briefly mentioned in the previous section , the renormalisation properties of self intersecting wilson loops are governed by the cross anomalous dimension matrix which in our case will be a gauge invariant @xmath100 matrix depending only on the coupling constant and crossing angle @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , the dependence of the renormalised expressions for the loops of figure 1 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , on the renormalisation point @xmath8 is given by the renormalisation group ( rg ) equations @xcite , @xcite [ rg ] ( + ( g))w_i^r = -^ij(,g)w_j^r-_k _ cusp(_k , g)_ijw_j^r ,  i , j=1,2 , where [ beta ] ( g)=_0 , @xmath104 is the bare coupling constant which is kept fixed as we differentiate the renormalised coupling @xmath105 with respect to @xmath8 and the sum over @xmath106 is a sum over all the cusps of figure 1a",
    ".    holds for generic loop configuration and implies that the wilson loops are multiplicatively renormalised .",
    "however , one should be careful when the tangent of the lines at the crossing point and/or at one or more of the cusps lie on the light - cone .",
    "this is precisely the case for the loops of figure 1 .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , for the wilson loops that contain both light - cone and cusp divergences there is no multiplicative renormalisability and , as a result , does not hold any more . before going on ,",
    "let us elaborate on the form the rg equations take in such a case .    the cross anomalous dimension matrix for a generic crossing configuration in qcd is known up to two loop order and is given in @xcite .",
    "although what interest us is the expectation value of the wilson loops at large @xmath66 we remain general and keep , for the moment , the number of the colours @xmath66 finite . since we eventually want to focus on the loops of figure 1 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 lie on the light - cone , it is sufficient to consider the large @xmath101 behaviour of the crossing matrix .",
    "the general structure of this matrix at large @xmath101 is that of equation 5.48 of @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 is a function which accepts a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant @xmath108 .",
    "the one - loop coefficient @xmath109 is determined by the exchange of a single gluon and it is , thus , the same in both qcd and @xmath110 sym . its value , @xmath111 , can be read directly from @xcite . however , this is not the case for @xmath112 since the determination of its value requires the self - energy correction to the gluon which is different in different theories .",
    "however , one word of caution is in order .",
    "firstly , equation 5.48 of @xcite was obtained by using the @xmath113 prescription for the feynman propagator .",
    "we have seen in section 3 that in order to have agreement between the analytic properties of the expression for the cusp and the corresponding expression for the ir divergences of the amplitude , one has to adopt the opposite prescription , namely @xmath114 .",
    "the effect of this change on the cross anomalous dimension matrix is to substitute @xmath115 with @xmath116 wherever it appears in the matrix .",
    "a second observation concerns the normalisation of the loop functions . in our conventions",
    "the loop @xmath117 is normalised by multiplying it by @xmath118 see , while @xmath119 is normalised by multiplying it by @xmath120 . on the other hand , these normalisations are absent from the wilson line definitions of @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the values for the entries of the crossing matrix we have to use are modified with respect to those of @xcite @xmath121 , the modification being @xmath122 , @xmath123 .    with these observations taken into account the cross",
    "anomalous dimension matrix reads : @xmath124    by keeping only the leading terms in @xmath101 in each of the entries of the crossing matrix it is possible to rewrite as [ rg1 ] ( + ( g))w_1^r = -_1(g)(w_1^r - n^2w_2^r)-_k _ cusp(_k , g)w_1^r & & + ( + ( g))(w_1^r - n^2w_2^r ) = ( -_1(g)-_cusp(g ) & & + -_k _ cusp(_k , g ) ) ( w_1^r - n^2w_2^r ) . & & when @xmath14 and @xmath15 lie on the light - cone @xmath101 becomes infinite and meaningless . in order to find the equations the loop functions satisfy in this case , one can use a similar trick to the one used in @xcite for a loop containing a null cusp .",

    "one can apply the same trick on the first equation of .",
    "namely we divide the first equation of by @xmath102 and differentiate repeatedly with respect to @xmath67 and with respect to the invariants @xmath134 associated to the cusps of figure 1a .",

    "the last set of equations are general and hold for any number of colours .",
    "what really interests us is their behaviour as @xmath135 .",
    "in such a limit becomes @xmath136 @xmath137 and @xmath133 appear as constants of integration and they do not depend on any of the kinematical invariants .",
    "this set of equations and in particular the first one will allow us to draw conclusions about the behaviour of the remainder function @xmath1 near the crossing configuration of figure 1a .    before proceeding let us examine the second equation of .",
    "it is a well - known fact that at large @xmath66 the wilson loop @xmath119 factorises into the product of the expectation values of the two separate loops @xmath47 and @xmath48 , that is [ fact ] w_2=w(c_1)w(c_2)=w(c_1)w(c_2 ) .",
    "but the result for @xmath138 and @xmath139 are known to all orders in perturbation theory since they are four - sided null loops and their form is completely determined by dual conformal invariance . by using their expressions given in @xcite it is not difficult to verify that @xmath119 satisfies , indeed , the second renormalisation group equation of .",

    "the subleading poles can also originate from diagrams where one or more gluons are not attached to the crossing gluons .",

    "in this section , we discuss some of the implications of the results obtained in the two previous sections .",
    "the one - loop n - gluon mhv scattering amplitude in @xmath110 sym was firstly evaluated in @xcite using unitarity methods , as well as information coming from taking appropriate collinear limits . to simplify the calculation of the integrals , the authors of @xcite restricted the calculation in the kinematical region where all the lorentz invariants are negative ( euclidean region ) .",
    "their result was that the helicity - blind part of the amplitude is a sum over all different two - mass easy box functions @xmath182 , all having coefficient equal to one .",
    "namely , [ m_1 ] m_1^(1)=_p , qf^2me(p , q , p , q ) , where @xmath182 is given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 is given by .",
    "if ones wishes to write down the amplitude in the physical region , one should analytically continue the expression .",
    "usually , this analytic continuation to positive values of the kinematic variables is achieved by applying the replacement @xmath185 . as was noticed in @xcite this",
    "naive continuation works fine for most of the terms in .",
    "however , the last dilogarithm of needs special care .",
    "one has to be careful to not cross its cut which extends from one to infinity on the real axis .",
    "the correct analytic continuation for this term is achieved by making the replacement [ continuation ] & & li_2(1-)li_2(1-)+ + & & ( ( ) -()- ( ) ) ( 1- ) . when supplemented with the second line of ,",
    "provides an expression for the two - mass easy box function which is valid for all kinematical regimes .",
    "a second representation of the two - mass easy box , which is also valid for all kinematical regimes , was obtained in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the expression for its finite part is given in .",
    "the equivalence of the latter with , properly analytically continued , was shown numerically in @xcite .",
    "it is elementary to check that it is precisely the non - trivial analytic continuation term appearing in which gives the @xmath186 of ( see ) .",
    "the contribution to the amplitude from the first term of , which is not a function of the invariant cross ratios @xmath187 has to cancel against an opposite contribution coming from the single gluon exchanges between non - adjacent legs .",
    "the reason for this is that the amplitude obeys the anomalous conformal ward identity @xcite -we remind the reader that we are now considering a case where @xmath5 is almost but not exactly one- [ ward ] k^f_n^(wl)_i^n ( 2x_i^ x_i_i -x_i^2_i^)f_n^(wl)=_cusp _ i^nx_i , i+1^ ( ) in any kinematical region . furthermore ,",
    "in @xcite it was checked that the one - loop n - gluon amplitude satisfies when all the invariants lie in the euclidean region .",
    "this implies that any terms coming from the non - trivial continuation discussed above should depend only on the conformal cross ratios .",
    "since all such terms come from the last dilog of they should be proportional to @xmath180 , see .",
    "this means that the non - conformal part of ( see also ) should cancel in the whole amplitude .",
    "we have checked , that this is , indeed , the case . furthermore notice",
    "that , if one was computing numerically the one loop amplitude and had restricted himself to the euclidean region , he would have obtained real values for all the integrals . in other words",
    ", he would have completely missed the second line of and the fact that @xmath182 has a branch cut related to the last dilog of .",
    "we now proceed to some comments regarding the behaviour of the two - loop remainder function @xmath1 . in a nice paper @xcite , this function was numerically evaluated for a wide range of the kinematic variables .",
    "one of the kinematic points the authors of @xcite considered was the point with conformal ratios @xmath188 for which the remainder function was found to be @xmath189 .",
    "this result is , apparently , in contradiction with ( see also ) and the discussion below it which predicts an infinite imaginary part for @xmath1 .",
    "however , one should not forget that the calculation of @xcite was performed in the euclidean region , whereas our result holds in the physical region .",
    "this suggests that , as in the one - loop case , the behaviour of the finite remainder @xmath1 dictated by is due to a non - trivial analytical continuation analogous to the one needed for the one - loop finite part and as such it could never be seen in the numerical calculations of @xcite,@xcite .",
    "since no analytic expression for the finite remainder function @xmath1 is known , let us see if we can get any information about it .",
    "the discussion at the end of section 4 shows that near the crossing configuration , that is as @xmath190 and @xmath191 , the remainder function @xmath1 behaves like @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is a rational constant .",
    "the simplest function reproducing the aforementioned leading behaviour of @xmath1 when analytically continued , in a similar fashion to , is @xmath194 . in order to avoid crossing the polylog s cut",
    ", one has to add additional terms proportional to the discontinuity of the function along the cut . taking into account that @xmath195 it is evident that the limiting behaviour of @xmath1 is consistent with the analytic continuation of @xmath194 . in any case",
    ", we should stress that the choice above is by no means unique , since the relation @xmath4 holds only as we asymptotically approach the crossing .",
    "however , this behaviour indicates that near the crossing @xmath1 includes a function of @xmath196 which has a branch cut for negative values of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that @xmath1 has a cut along the negative @xmath5 axis when @xmath3 .",
    "it is clearly desirable to obtain an analytic expression for the remainder function .",
    "the positions where its cuts are situated as well as the discontinuities along these cuts can play a crucial role to its determination .",
    "thus , it is evident that the analytic properties of @xmath1 are very important .",
    "an interesting discussion of the analytic structure of the wilson loop diagrams was presented in @xcite .",
    "we close this note by making two remarks .",
    "the first concerns the transcendentality of @xmath1 .",
    "all the terms in have the same transcendentality 4 , in agreement with the transcendentality principle , provided that @xmath112 and @xmath197 have transcendentality 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the second concerns the fact that it is not possible to construct crossing configurations for the scattering of 4 and 5 gluons .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that a non - trivial remainder function @xmath1 starts appearing from 6 gluons on .",
