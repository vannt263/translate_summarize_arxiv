    "intersecting branes at arbitrary angles have been studied both in view of their susy properties in supergravity @xcite and their short - range interactions in string and m(atrix ) theory @xcite . despite the variety of the information on susy properties of branes at angles ,",
    "less has been known about the structure of the supergravity solutions that describe this type of configurations .",
    "the well known examples of these solutions include the 2-angle ( marginal ) configuration of two d2-branes at @xmath0 angles @xcite , and the 4-angle ( non - marginal ) configuration of two ns5-branes at @xmath1 angles @xcite and their generalizations to @xmath2 such branes @xcite ( for some other works in this respect see also @xcite ) .",
    "the solution for the ( marginal ) configuration at @xmath0 angles of two arbitrary similar branes has been recently found in @xcite . nevertheless , there has been no solutions that describe , for example , marginal intersections of similar branes at three or more angles , or those for the non - similar branes at other than the right angles .",
    "a systematic approach to the solution of this problem can be found in the works of @xcite , where such solutions for a _ distributed _ system of branes at angles are considered .",
    "the analysis of these solutions , in the light of a general formulation in @xcite , reveals that , as far as we deal with flat p - branes , such solutions can not be realized in terms of the harmonic functions . that is , in general",
    ", one can not find configurations of branes at angles constructed from parallel distributions of flat p - branes .",
    "the physics underlying this property can be better understood , if one takes into account the role of the brane(s ) interactions and dynamics in forming a configuration at several angles .",
    "in fact , determining the stability conditions for any configuration of p - branes , based on the worldvolume dynamics of the branes , is logically prior to any effort for finding a supergravity background that describes the configuration .",
    "the interactions of d - branes at angles have been studied by calculating the amplitudes in the scattering processes , both in string and m(atrix ) theory , which determine the static potentials between pairs of these objects @xcite . that such a potential _ identically _ vanishes determines the necessary condition for the stability of the configuration .",
    "one of the basic ingredients in such calculations , which makes them at all possible , is the assumption of _ flatness _ for the worldvolume geometries of the individual branes as well as their spacetime background .",
    "however , there may exist configurations for which the the two branes are not flat and so all features of their motion can not be described by a single potential .",
    "for example , they may tend to rotate relative to each other due to the ` twisting forces ' ( or the relative ` torques ' ) between themselves .",
    "so one has to add the conditions that guaranty the balancing of such forces as well .",
    "in fact , the full set of the stability conditions for a configuration of two interacting branes are those that satisfy the equations of motion for both of the branes when they are in _ flat _ states .",
    "doing this , in general , involves extra complexities because of the need for determining the supergravity background for an arbitrarily curved p - brane .",
    "for flat bps branes , however , this problem is considerably simplified by the fact that a bps brane in this state does not suffer from ` self - interaction ' forces .",
    "indeed , in such a case the forces on each individual brane , due to coupling to its own supergravity background , are balanced against each other and hence , it can be studied as a _ probe _ scattered from another brane , which is the _ source _ of a well known supergravity background @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study and classify possible configurations of branes at angles , assuming the dbi+wz worldvolume action as the branes dynamics . to this end , we first determine the general necessary and sufficient conditions that specify a stable configuration of two arbitrary flat branes in section 2",
    ". then , in sections 3,4,5 , we use these general conditions for categorizing several configurations of two branes at angles for the cases of similar , non - similar and electromagnetic dual branes .",
    "we will consider both the marginal and non - marginal bound states in these sections .",
    "multi - angle marginal intersections are discussed in section 5 , and at the end , we derive physical interpretations for our stability conditions in section 7 .",
    "we end the paper by a summary and some remarks .",
    "as the discussion in the introduction implies , in all cases with flat worldvolume geometries , one can describe a two brane system , equivalently , by the worldvolume action for each of its constituent branes . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath3 and we take the @xmath4-brane as a probe moving in the background fields produced by a @xmath5-brane source . to describe this configuration",
    ", we shall use an orthogonal coordinate system whose axes are defined using the tangent and normal directions of the two branes as indicared in table ( 1 ) . in",
    "this table @xmath6 stands for the dimension of the hyperplane spanned by the world directions of the two branes , and @xmath7 denotes the spacetime dimension .",
    "the situation is schematically displayed in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "@xmath8    table ( 1 ) : decomposition of the spacetime coordinates    we choose @xmath9 as the parameterizing coordinates of the probe and @xmath10 as its embedding coordinates .",
    "according to the count of coordinates in table ( 1 ) , there are cases for which some of the coordinates in our decompoition are not present .",
    "for example , when @xmath11 , we have no @xmath12 coordinates .",
    "similarly , when @xmath13 ( i.e. , the two branes are parallel ) , there are no @xmath14 and @xmath15 coordinates . however , this has no effect on our general equations as they are formulated in terms of the coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 regardless their numbers .",
    "thus , the embedding coordinates for a probe rotated / boosted relative to a fixed source are represented as y^a(x)=^a_x^+y^a_0 [ 1]with @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s representing constant slopes / velocities and shifts .",
    "it is clear from the definitions in table ( 1 ) that ^a_=^i_=^a_=0 [ 2]that is , @xmath20 are constants and none of @xmath21 s depend on @xmath22 .",
    "evidently , the remaining @xmath23 s can not have arbitrary values .",
    "in fact , they have to be chosen in a way that eq.([1 ] ) solves the @xmath4-brane equations of motion : _ ( ) -=0 [ 3]where @xmath24 denotes the relevant worldvolume lagrangian .",
    "that is , @xmath18 s must be such the identities ( ^b _ -^b_a)0 [ 4]hold for all values of @xmath25 . here",
    ", @xmath26 have to be considered as the function @xmath27 , whose @xmath21-dependences turn to appear in the form ( y^a;^a_)=(h ( )  ;  ^a _ ) [ 5]where @xmath28 represents a harmonic function in the @xmath29-directions @xcite . taking this into account , and that @xmath30 s are independent coordinates as far as @xmath14 s are",
    "so , one can see that eq.([4 ] ) leads to z^a=0 [ 6](^r _ -^r_s)=0 [ 7]we will refer to eqs.([6]),([7 ] ) as the ` no - force ' and ` no - torque ' conditions , respectively , since they are indeed the conditions for the vanishing of the oscillations along the transverse directions of the two branes , as well as their ( relative ) rotations along the relative transverse directions ( see section 7 ) .      by definition , a ` marginal ' configuration of two branes is the one which is stable at any arbitrary separations of the two branes , i.e. , for any _ constant _ values of @xmath31 s .",
    "this , according to eq.([6 ] ) , implies ( h;)_0( ) [ 8]showing that the total potential energy between the two branes has a constant value .",
    "it is obvious that eq.([7 ] ) in this case is automatic and hence the above equation is the unique description of the ` marginal ' configurations .",
    "+ there exist other configurations , however , that can be formed only at zero separations of the two participating branes , i.e. , when the centers of the two branes in their transverse space are coincident and they actually intersect each other .",
    "we refer to these as the non - marginal configurations @xcite . for such solutions , with @xmath32 , eq.([6 ] )",
    "is automatic and hence eq.([7 ] ) or its equivalent as ^r_-^r_s^r_s (  ) [ 9]provides a unique description for the non - marginal configurations . in the following three sections ,",
    "we analyze the eqs.([8]),([9 ] ) for classifying several marginal and non - marginal configurations that may occur in cases with a pair of similar @xmath33 , non - similar @xmath34 and electromagnetic dual @xmath35 branes .",
    "the notations will be mainly identical to those introduced in @xcite .",
    "using the general expression of the lagrangian for a @xmath36-probe in a @xmath36-source background @xcite , the function @xmath37 is found to be = h^-1[det^1/2(+h)-1 ] [ 10]where the angular information is encoded in the matrix @xmath38 having the components ^_^r^r _ [ 11]and the indices of the type of @xmath39 are raised and lowered by @xmath40 .",
    "the matrix @xmath38 can be diagonalized by choosing the coordinates @xmath41 so that the two branes to be related by a set of ` commuting ' rotations and a boost . in such coordinates , @xmath38 has the components ^_=diag(-v^2,tan^2_1,,tan^2_d-1)= : ^ _ _ [ 12]here , @xmath42 represents the magnitude of the velocity vector in the directions transverse to the @xmath36-source and @xmath43 s are the angles of the @xmath36 commuting rotations ( obviously , a number @xmath44 of these angles are vanishing by assumption ) .",
    "inserting the expression ( [ 10 ] ) for @xmath26 into the ` marginality ' condition , eq.([8 ] ) , one obtains det(+h)(1+_0h)^2  ( h>0 ) [ 13]in the basis that @xmath38 has the form of eq.([12 ] ) , this identity reads ( 1-v^2h)(1+tan^2_1h)(1+tan^2_d-1h)(1+_0h)^2 [ 14]thus the only possibility for the rotation and boost parameters is & & _ 1=_2= : + & & v=_3==_d-1=0 [ 15]that is : + the only marginal configuration of two similar branes are the static configurations with two non - vanishing angles obtained by an abelian subgroup of the @xmath0 rotations .",
    "+ this is the same as the 1/4 susy configuration whose supergravity solution had been found earlier in @xcite as a generalization to the solution of 2-branes at angles @xcite .",
    "the constant value of @xmath26 in this case is @xmath45 . +",
    "another possibility , which one might consider for two similar branes , was the brane - anti - brane system . in this case",
    "the constant term @xmath46 in brackets in eq.([10 ] ) would be flipped to ( + 1 ) which is equivalent to flipping @xmath47 to @xmath48 in eq.([13 ] ) or ( [ 14 ] ) . however , because @xmath49 in this case , eq.([14 ] ) could not be satisfied for any real values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 s . in other words ,",
    "a brane - anti - brane pair with any combination of a boost and several rotations is unstable and can not form a marginal configuration .",
    "it is easy to see that the ` non - marginality ' condition , eq.([9 ] ) , after some algebra reduces to ( ^-1)^^r_^s_- ^rsh^-1(-1)=^rs [ 16]where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are a set of angle - dependent constants . in the basis that makes @xmath38 diagonal ( eq.([12 ] ) ) , the above equation is also diagonal and after some manipulations yields _ ( 1+h_)(1+h_r)^2(1+h_r)^2  ( h>0 ) [ 17]where @xmath53 . for this equation to be satisfied identically , one needs & & _",

    "orthogonal configurations of the 4-angle intersections have been found previously in the literature of the supergravity composite brane solutions @xcite .",
    "the most famous examples in this category consist of the @xmath55 in @xmath56 ii a , b , @xmath57 in @xmath56 ii b and @xmath58 in d=11 @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "a 4-angle configuration of this type for the ii a ns5-branes at sp(2 ) angles has been found , by directly solving the supergravity and killing spinor equations , showing that it preserves at least 3/32 of the susy ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "the general worldvolume lagrangian for a @xmath4-probe in a @xmath5-source background , with @xmath59 @xcite , gives rise to an expression for @xmath37 as = h^-m/2det^1/2(+h ) [ 19]where @xmath38 is given by eq.([11 ] ) and @xmath60 is a function of dimensions defined as m(d_1,d_2)= 2(d_1)(d_2)+d_1_2 [ 20]for marginal configurations , @xmath60 specifies the number of ( non - vanishing ) angles ( see @xcite and below ) . here , @xmath61 represents the dilaton - d - form coupling constant satisfying @xcite ^2(d)=1-d [ 21 ]      the marginality condition , eq.([8 ] ) , in this case gives _ ( 1+h_)_0 ^ 2h^m  ( h>0 ) [ 22]obviously , such an identity can be true whenever @xmath62 , and a number @xmath60 of @xmath63 s to be @xmath64 , while the remaining are vanishing .",

    "therefore : + the only ` marginal ' bound state of a pair of ` non - similar ' @xmath66-branes are the ` static orthogonal ' configurations in which the two branes share @xmath67 of their directions , where @xmath44 must satisfy = -2(d_1)(d_2)+d_1d_2 [ 24]this is , in fact , the so called ` intersection rule ' of the intersecting brane systems , which was originally found in the study of their supergravity solutions @xcite , and then re - appeared in the reduced lagrangian approach to the distributed brane systems in @xcite and was interpreted there as an algebraic constraint ) can be viewed as a relation between the gravitational and dilatonic ` charges ' @xmath68 , @xmath69 of the two branes , with @xmath70 being their masses , for the corresponding forces to cancel each other @xcite . ] required by the no - force conditions @xcite .",
    "the ` non - marginality ' condition , eq.([9 ] ) , in this case gives the counterpart of eq.([16 ] ) as h^-m/2\\ { h(^-1)^^r_^s_- ^rs } = ^rs [ 25]which in the @xmath38-diagonalizing basis ( eq.([12 ] ) ) takes the form of the identity _",
    "( 1+h_a)_r^2h^m(1+h_r)^2  ( h>0 ) [ 26]which is the analogue of eq.([17 ] ) .",
    "obviously , such an identity holds ( for each @xmath71 ) , if and only if @xmath72 , and further @xmath73 of @xmath63 s are infinity while the others are vanishing .",
    "therefore , & & _",
    "1==_m+2=/2 + & & _ m+3==_d_1 - 1=v=0 [ 27]these are just the conditions ( [ 23 ] ) in which @xmath60 has been replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "so we have the result : + the only ` non - marginal ' bound state of a pair of ` non - similar ' @xmath66-branes are the ` static orthogonal ' configurations in which the two branes share @xmath67 of their directions , with @xmath44 satisfying + 2=-2(d_1)(d_2)+d_1d_2 [ 28]which shifts @xmath44 by a @xmath74 relative to the one given by the rule ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "this is just the same equation identified as the intersection rule of the ` localized intersections ' in @xcite . by the above derivation",
    ", however , it has to be identified as a rule for the ` non - marginal ' intersections .",
    "an ` electromagnetic ' dual pair of branes , a priori , can not be placed in either of the two categories studied in sections 3,4 .",
    "this is due to the fact that an electromagnetic dual pair with @xmath75-branes is the source of a single @xmath76-form potential @xmath77 , which couples to the two branes through @xmath78 and its dual @xmath79 respectively @xcite . taking this point into account , and assuming @xmath80 to adapt with the conventions of section 2 , one obtains the modified version of eq.([4 ] ) as ( ^n _ -_mn - c_mnh ) 0 [ 29]where @xmath26 is defined in eq.([19 ] ) in which @xmath81 , and the constants @xmath82 are defined as _ mn= _",
    "mnl_1l_d^_1_d ^l_1__1^l_d__d/(d!)^2 [ 30]here , the two epsilons stand for the levi - civita symbols in the subspaces of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . the modifying term @xmath85 in eq.([29 ] ) , however , does _ not _ modify the results of section 4 for the branes at angles with @xmath86 .",
    "the reason , as can be checked using eq.([12 ] ) , is that in all @xmath87 cases one obtains @xmath88 .",
    "thus the rule ( [ 24 ] ) ( with @xmath89 ) and eq.([21 ] ) imply @xmath90 . hence : + the only marginal configuration of an electromagnetic dual pair of @xmath75-branes is a ` static ' configuration in which the two branes ` orthogonally ' intersect ( overlap ) on a string .",
    "on the other hand , a non - marginal configuration should obey the rule ( [ 28 ] ) , which in this case implies that @xmath91 .",
    "this is in obvious contradiction with the static - ness property asserted above the rule ( [ 28 ] ) which means that such configurations of @xmath92 can not be realized .",
    "the results of the previous sections regarding the non - marginal configurations , in particular their intersection rule ( eq.([28 ] ) ) , are based on the no - torque condition ( eq.([7 ] ) ) which severly relies on the existence of at least one pair of coordinates @xmath41 in table ( 1 ) . since for a pair of parallel branes ( i.e. a configuration of the form @xmath93 ) there are no such coordinates , hence the stability condition for such configurations should have a different form .",
    "whatever the form of these conditons , they should guarantee that the equations of motion ( eq.([4 ] ) ) are satisfied . in the case at hand",
    "all @xmath94 s are zero and this equation reduces to : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the same as @xmath97 . noting that @xmath28 in this case depends only on @xmath31 through @xmath98 , and further that @xmath32 in the non - marginal case , the above equation yields : |_r=0=0 [ * ] where @xmath99 . for a pair of non - similar branes we find from eq.([19 ] ) that v(r)=(h(r))^-m/2=(1+q_2)^-m/2 here @xmath100 is the transverse dimension and @xmath101 is ( proportional to ) the charge of @xmath5-brane and @xmath60 is defined as in eq.([20 ] ) .",
    "( we have assumed that @xmath3 and @xmath102 . )",
    "it is obvious that @xmath103 is proportional to the potential energy between the two branes at a separation @xmath71 and eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) indicates that their mutual forces tend to balance each other as @xmath104 .",
    "now , since in this limit @xmath105 , the above condition means that the function @xmath103 should be regular near @xmath106 at least to the first order in its derivatives , requiring that m(m-2)>2 or equivalently _ 1_2>2(d-2 ) -d_1d_2 ^ 2 this inequality together with @xmath3 and @xmath102 in turn specifies all the non - marginal bound states of the form of branes within branes",
    ". special cases of such configurations are those with a self dual pair , i.e. with @xmath107 . since in this case @xmath108 , @xmath81 , the above condition ( assuming @xmath109 ) yields : @xmath110 showing that such configurations are possible only in @xmath111 dimensions .",
    "famous examples of such configurations are @xmath112 in @xmath113 and the dyonic membrane ( bound state of an electric and a magnetic 2-brane ) in @xmath114 dimensions , which were known through their supergravity solutions @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous sections indicate that , except for the 2-angle static configuration of similar branes at @xmath0 angles , no other configuration of two flat branes with several angles and boost can be marginally stable . while , both the scattering amplitude and superalgebra computations @xcite indicate that multi - angle intersections , under certain conditions among their angles , can form a marginal configuration , it is amazing that the worldvolume solutions appropriate to a pair of flat branes are not realizable .",
    "this apparent contradiction is resolved by recalling that all the scattering amplitude and superalgebra computations rely heavily on the basic assumption for the existence of an ` asymptotic state ' in which the branes behave like flat hypersurfaces in a minkowski space . in the string theory language ,",
    "the perturbative calculation of the scattering amplitudes are reliable only in the weak coupling region of the theory where one deals with weak ( linearized ) gravitational interactions .",
    "this restricts such calculations to the ` far ' or ` asymptotic ' region of the two branes where they look like flat hypersurfaces in a flat spacetime . on the susy side , also",
    ", one does not need to solve a killing spinor equation in all of the space to determine susy fraction preserved by a brane configuration . to do this",
    ", it suffices to solve only the asymptotic ( algebraic ) killing spinor equation @xcite , which encodes _ only _ the asymptotic form of the spacetime metric and of the geometry of branes . as a result",
    ", there may be bps states of _ curved _ p - branes which look like asymptotically as multi - angle configurations of flat p - branes . in the asymptotic region",
    ", we will see that the no - force condition to first order will require a certain angular constraint which is just the same that characterizes these bps states @xcite .",
    "however , the same no - force condition to higher orders , as well as the no - torque condition , are not satisfied except for the marginal configurations which were categorized in sections 3,4 .",
    "this means , firstly , that the marginal multi - angle configurations , generally , can not consist of flat p - branes .",
    "secondly , even in the case of an asymptotically force - free configuration , the relative angular position of the two branes is influenced by a non - vanishing torque which eventually brings them together by counterbalancing the forces that act between themselves .",
    "in general , the force and torque conditions , eq.([8]),([9 ] ) , are equivalent to a set of algebraic constraints relating @xmath115 s together .",
    "this can be seen easily by putting @xmath116 and expanding @xmath117 as ( 1+h;)=_n=0 ^ 1_n()h^n [ 32]upon this expansion , eqs.([8]),([9 ] ) give respectively _ n()=0 [ 33]^r__n-^r_s_n=0 [ 34]where @xmath118 . for a ` real ' marginal bound state of flat p - branes , these two sets of equations for all @xmath2 restrict possible configurations to those of sections 3,4 .",
    "however , for a configuration of curved p - branes with asymptotic flat geometries , we may continue to _ define _ the marginality property by demanding that @xmath117 to be constant _ only _ to first order in @xmath119 in the asymptotic region @xmath120 .",
    "such ` asymptotic marginal ' configurations , thus , are distinguished by a condition on the angles as @xmath121 .",
    "this condition , though provides a mean of translational stability , does _ not _ insure rotational stability of the two brane system , which to be guaranteed by the eq.([34 ] ) for @xmath122 . these two conditions together ,",
    "will be seen that , restrict the possible marginal configurations to those obtained in sections 3,4 .",
    "we now examine the explicit expressions of these conditions in the previous cases .",

    "the above procedure , thus eventually , determines @xmath151 to any arbitrary order in the expansion parameter @xmath133 .",

    "this paper categorizes several configurations of two arbitrary branes at angles which are derivable from the dbi+wz action for p - branes . in using this dynamics for p - branes",

    "further , we have assumed that neither of the two branes is affected by the fields that originate from itself , at least when it is stretched as a flat hypersurface ( the bps or no - force condition for single branes ) .",

    "the analysis for both of these cases reveals two types of configurations : the marginal and the non - marginal ones . in the marginal case",
    ", we found that the only configuration of similar branes at angles is the one with two angles in a subgroup of @xmath0 , while the only one for non - similar branes is an orthogonal configuration obeying the ordinary intersection rule @xcite . in this case , no configuration with more than two angles can be found @xcite . in the non - marginal case",
    ", on the other hand , we saw that the only configuration with similar branes is the one with four angles in two independent subgroups of @xmath0 , while the only one for non - similar branes is an orthogonal configuration obeying an unusual rule of intersection , previously identified as the localized branes intersection rule @xcite .",
    "while , the whole analysis in this paper considers only two brane configurations , the @xmath175 brane configurations can also be undertaken by a similar analysis , provided one knows the background fields for each @xmath176 of these branes .",
    "though , for marginal configurations , this does not seem to give additional information other than those for pair - wise intersections , it may be a useful device for investigating about the non - marginal configurations made up of several branes .",
    "it should be emphasized here that _",
    "marginal _ multi - angle configurations , other than those stated in the above which all had been found in the context of the classical supergravity solutions , no other marginal configuration can be constructed from a set of _ flat _ p - branes .",
    "this is why the solutions of this kind had not been discovered in the supergravity solutions literature .",
    "( this , however , does not prevent the possibility of having non - marginal solutions with several angles . )",
    "it is tempting to ask that whether one can form marginal multi - angle configurations by putting suitable curvatures on their worldvolumes .",
    "of course , in such a case one has to define rigorously the ` marginality ' property . in the case of asymptotic flat p - branes",
    ", we defined it as the stability of the configuration at _ arbitrary _ separation of the two branes as measured in their _ asymptotic _ region .",
    "we have answered the above question , only partially , by perturbing the worldvolume of one of the branes when it is posed to the background of the other ` unperturbed ' brane , and find that the marginality requirement , in general , breaks the conditions for the flatness of the worldvolume .",
    "a general treatment requires propagating both of the branes and looking for the conditions that need to be asymptotically flat .",
