    "the fact that annihilation of dark matter can give rise to photons with a well - defined energy @xcite has motivated searches for such gamma lines originating from the center of our galaxy by the egret  @xcite , h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite and fermi  lat  @xcite experiments .",
    "recent analyses of the publicly available data from fermi  lat have discovered hints for a gamma line at @xmath3  gev in the form of an excess of about @xmath4  standard deviations , assuming that the background flux can be approximated by a single power law .",
    "an interpretation of this excess as dark matter pair annihilation into a pair of photons would require a partial annihilation cross section of about @xmath0  @xmath1  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , more general parametrizations of the background flux @xcite reduce the significance of the excess , making it compatible with a diffuse background possibly of instrumental or astrophysical origin .",
    "the fermi  lat collaboration preferred to interpret the same data only in terms of upper bounds on the partial annihilation cross section @xcite .",
    "still , future additional data could confirm the present hints for a possible excess ; hence it is of interest to study whether it could be explained within concrete models for dark matter which are compatible with bounds on its relic density from wmap  @xcite and bounds on its direct detection cross section ( in the relevant mass range ) from xenon100  @xcite .    following the publication @xcite , different types of such models have been proposed : models with an extra u(1) gauge symmetry where the dark matter couples only to the extra @xmath5 gauge boson , and the @xmath5 to photons via a chern - simons term @xcite ; models with an extra singlet and extra charged fields allowing for an enhanced branching ratio of the standard model - like higgs boson into two photons @xcite ; extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) by right - handed neutrinos and extra higgs doublets ( with a right - handed sneutrino as dark matter ) @xcite ; decaying dark matter in the mssm extended by additional fields and couplings  @xcite ; extensions of the standard model or the mssm by singlets with peccei - quinn symmetry where dark matter can annihilate into a photon pair via an axion in the s - channel @xcite ; a string / m - theory motivated version of the mssm ( with an unconventional spectrum involving very heavy scalar superpartners ) where wino - like dark matter can annihilate into a photon plus a @xmath6 boson @xcite .",
    "( in the mssm with bino- or higgsino - like dark matter , the annihilation cross section into one or two photons would be too small @xcite . )    in the present paper we consider the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model with a scale invariant superpotential , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite . in the nmssm , the higgs / higgsino mass term @xmath7 in the superpotential of the mssm",
    "is replaced by a coupling @xmath8 to a gauge singlet superfield  @xmath9 . compared to the mssm ,",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm includes additional neutral cp - even and cp - odd states .",
    "it is known that a large dark matter ( neutralino ) annihilation cross section into two photons can arise from neutralino annihilation through the nmssm - specific cp - odd higgs boson in the s - channel @xcite . moreover , due to the coupling @xmath8 the lightest cp - even higgs mass is naturally heavier than in the mssm @xcite which makes it easier to explain a higgs mass of 125  gev @xcite .",
    "hence an obvious question is whether the parameter space of the nmssm can describe simultaneously the following phenomena : 1 ) a neutralino - like dark matter particle of a mass of about 130  gev with a partial annihilation cross section into two photons of about @xmath0  @xmath1  s@xmath2 and a relic density compatible with wmap constraints , 2 ) a standard model - like higgs boson with a mass of about 125  gev , but 3 ) respecting the upper bound of xenon100 on the dark matter direct detection cross section .    we find that this is indeed possible , provided the nmssm - specific coupling @xmath10 is relatively large , @xmath11 .",
    "this coupling plays several rles simultaneously : i ) it determines the coupling of the neutralino - like dark matter to the nmssm - specific cp - odd higgs boson ; ii ) it determines the coupling of the cp - odd higgs boson to charged higgsinos , whose loop leads to a large decay width into two photons ; iii ) it helps to increase the mass of the standard model - like cp - even higgs boson .",
    "however , the mass of the nmssm - specific cp - odd higgs boson has to be close to 260  gev ( the s - channel pole ) for a neutralino annihilation cross section into two photons equal to or larger than @xmath0  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , no new particles or interactions beyond the nmssm need to be introduced if the present hints for a 130  gev gamma line from dark matter annihilation in our galaxy are confirmed .    in the next section we introduce the nmssm and describe ,",
    "which properties of the nmssm allow to describe simultaneously all the above phenomena .",
    "we indicate a possible region in the parameter space , and discuss the range of possible direct detection cross sections and neutralino annihilation cross sections into two photons .",
    "details of the higgs and neutralino sector are presented for a typical benchmark point .",
    "section  3 is devoted to a short summary and conclusions .",
    "the nmssm differs from the mssm due to the presence of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath12 . in the simplest realisation of the nmssm , the higgs mass term @xmath13 in the mssm superpotential @xmath14",
    "is replaced by the coupling @xmath10 of @xmath12 to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and a self - coupling @xmath17 .",
    "hence , in this version the superpotential @xmath18 is scale invariant , and given by : [ eq:1 ] w _ = s h_uh_d + s^3 +  , where the dots denote the yukawa couplings of @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the quarks and leptons as in the mssm .",
    "the nmssm - specific soft susy breaking terms consist of a mass term for the scalar components of @xmath12 , and trilinear interactions associated to the terms in @xmath18 : [ eq:2 ] -l_^soft = m_s^2 |s|^2 + ( a _ h_u h_d s + a _ s^3 )  +  .",
    "subsequently we define the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) [ eq:3 ] = v_u , = v_d , = s . in terms of @xmath19 ,",

    "the neutral cp - even higgs sector contains 3 states @xmath21 , which are mixtures of the cp - even components of the superfields @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath12 .",
    "their masses are described by a @xmath22 mass matrix @xmath23 , where the dominant contribution to the singlet - like component @xmath24 reads @xcite [ eq:6 ] m^2_h33 ~s(a_+ 4 s ) .",

    ", ^2_a12 ~(a_-2s ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "in the neutralino sector we have 5 states @xmath31 , which are mixtures of the bino @xmath32 , the neutral wino @xmath33 , the neutral higgsinos @xmath34 , @xmath35 from the superfields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the singlino from the superfield @xmath12 .",

    "the lightest eigenstate @xmath42 of the neutralino mass matrix is considered as the dark matter particle . in the above basis",

    "the pair annihilation of @xmath42 into two photons can be generated via a dominantly singlet - like cp - odd higgs state @xmath43 in the s - channel @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "( similar diagrams with @xmath44 replaced by ( s)quarks or ( s)leptons are numerically negligible . )    now we turn to the masses and couplings of the particles and the corresponding regions in the nmssm parameter space , which have all desired phenomenological properties .",
    "first we consider the dominantly singlet - like cp - odd higgs state @xmath43 .",
    "for a sufficiently large @xmath42 pair annihilation cross section into two photons ( and @xmath45  gev ) , we need [ eq:10 ] m_a_s ~2m_^0_1~260   , which can be achieved by appropriate values of @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the su(2 ) doublet admixture of @xmath43 must be small : otherwise tree level diagrams similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] but with @xmath43 decaying directly into @xmath47 ( or into @xmath6 plus a light cp - even higgs boson ) , lead to a too large pair annihilation cross section of @xmath42 such that its relic density is below the wmap bound . from the second of eqs .",
    "the mixing of @xmath43 with the mssm - like doublet is small for [ eq:11 ] a_2s .",
    "next we consider the dark matter particle @xmath42 .",
    "it would have a large singlino component for small @xmath48 .",
    "however , from eq .   and the first of eqs .   one can derive [ eq:12 ] ( 2s)^2 ~m^2_h33 + m^2_a_s ; from @xmath49  gev and @xmath50 it follows that @xmath48 can not be small . hence , assuming @xmath51 ( assuming universal gaugino masses at the gut scale ) , it follows that @xmath42 has dominant bino and higgsino components .",
    "a priori large higgsino components seem desirable , given the required coupling of @xmath42 to @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : this coupling is induced by the first term @xmath52 in the superpotential , which leads to a yukawa coupling @xmath53 . likewise , the coupling of @xmath43 to the charginos @xmath44 originates from the higgsino components @xmath54 , @xmath55 of @xmath44 and the yukawa coupling @xmath56 .",
    "however , too large higgsino components of @xmath42 imply again a too small relic density ; diagrams with charginos and neutralinos in the t - channel ( and @xmath57 or @xmath58 in the final state ) , cp - even higgs bosons in the s - channel etc . would lead to a too large pair annihilation cross section of @xmath42 .",
    "hence we end up with a dominantly bino - like @xmath42 , but with non - zero ( non - negligible ) higgsino components .",
    "its mass of 130  gev has to follow from appropriate values of @xmath40 and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "finally we require a sm - like cp - even higgs boson @xmath61 with a mass @xmath62 near 125  gev . although its existence is not confirmed at present , it is interesting to investigate whether it could comply with the above properties of the neutralino and cp - odd higgs sector .",

    "subsequently we choose corresponding values of @xmath10 and @xmath63 such that @xmath64  gev @xcite .",
    "we find that the above properties in the neutralino and cp - odd higgs sector imply that @xmath61 is the lightest cp - even higgs state ; the singlet - like cp - even higgs state has a mass @xmath65  gev .",
    "the scenario with a lightest singlet - like higgs state and a next - to - lightest sm - like higgs state ( allowing for an enhanced branching ratio into @xmath66 @xcite ) seems difficult to realize .",
    "herewith we have sketched the interesting regions in the parameter space in  .",
    "an open question remains whether the dark matter particle can comply with the constraints from xenon100 on its spin - independent detection cross section : @xmath42-nucleon scattering is induced dominantly by @xmath61-exchange in the t - channel @xcite , and the @xmath61-@xmath42-@xmath42 vertex is proportional to the product of the bino- and higgsino - components of @xmath42 ( from @xmath67 bino @xmath68 higgs @xmath68 higgsino terms in the lagrangian , where @xmath69 is the u(1)@xmath70 gauge coupling ) .",
