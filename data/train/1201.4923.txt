    "the appearance of chatter was noticed and described by taylor in the beginning of 20th century @xcite .",

    "recently , apart from the widely developed chatter vibrations chaotic oscillations caused by various system nonlinearities were predicted and detected @xcite .",
    "the recent technological demand is to improve the final surface properties of the workpiece and to minimize the production time with higher cutting speeds @xcite .",
    "thus a better understanding of the physical phenomena associated with a cutting process becomes necessary @xcite . in this paper",
