    "does not show any transition below room temperature but a difference between resistivity value during cooling and heating cycle is noticeable over entire temperature range .",
    "the origin of this hysteresis is not clear to us .",
    "this is similar to _ m - t _ measurement on ferh filings by lommel et al .",
    "@xcite , where magnetization at 300 k is smaller after cooling the sample to 78 k and warming back to 300 k. annealed sample shows a sharp rise in resistivity with decreasing temperature which indicates transition from low resistive fm phase to high resistive afm phase . during heating , a reverse transformation from afm to fm state",
    "occurs at higher temperature resulting in a hysteresis , which is a signature of first order nature of the transition .",
    "the transition temperature , taken as the inflection point of the resistivity curve , is found to be @xmath39 k during cooling and @xmath40 k during heating .",
    "besides this , fm to afm transition is quite broad as transition width during cooling as well as heating is found to be around 55 k. the studies around @xmath6 in analogous system has shown the presence of coexisting afm and fm phase and broadening is attributed to residual lattice imperfection , chemical disorder along with the internal stress caused from anisotropic lattice expansion @xcite . due to disorder ,",
    "different regions having length scale of the order of the correlation length can have different transition temperatures @xmath6 , and this results in broadening of transition line as well as supercooling @xmath41/superheating @xmath42 spinodals into a band for a macroscopic sample @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the study of first order afm - fm transition at low temperature , further studies are performed on annealed sample only , which will be discussed in the following sections .    )",

    "this observation of constant hysteresis width with varying magnetic field is in agreement with the studies on analogous systems having @xmath6 close to or above room temperature @xcite . for 6 t magnetic field , transition width during cooling increases significantly in spite of decrease in resistivity jump across the transition . since @xmath47 value",
    "does not reach the zero field resistivity value even after completion of hysteretic region , it suggest the presence of fm phase coexisting with afm phase at low temperature . in the presence of 8 t magnetic field , there is no clear indication of fm - afm transition , however , presence of small hysteresis indicates partial transformation of fm phase into afm phase during cooling .",
    "these results show that with the application of magnetic field fm - afm transition is suppressed only up to @xmath48 k ( instead of reducing toward 0 k ) and no fm to afm transformation takes place below this temperature .",
    "it is worth noting here that even transition metal substitution studies show abrupt vanishing of afm - fm transition temperature with substitution ( or first order transition with composition ) and @xmath6 is always found to be either higher than 100 k or absent @xcite .     at 5 k for fcw ( blue star ) and zfcw ( red diamond ) curve , highlighting the path dependence of fm and afm phase fraction ( see text for details).,width=8 ]    to verify if these co - existing states in 6 t and fm states in 8 t are ergodic state we followed different path for resistivity measurement under same temperature and magnetic field values as used in figure 3 .",
    "now , system is cooled to 5 k under zero field and labeled magnetic field applied isothermally at 5 k and resistivity is measured during warming ( zfcw ) .",
    "figure 4 shows zfcw curves along with corresponding fcw curves taken from figure 3 . for 2 t and 4 t both",
    "the curves are almost identical .",
    "however for 6 t and 8 t , zfcw curves have higher resistivity compared to fcw curve below @xmath6 .",
    "left inset of figure 4 shows the zfcw and fcw magnetization curves in the presence of 6 t magnetic field .",
    "it shows higher magnetization for fcw compared to zfcw .",
    "a difference between zfcw and fcw in magnetization measurement has been observed by navarro et .",
    "@xcite and hernando et .",
    "@xcite on ball - milled fcc ferh . there",
    "the difference between zfcw and fcw decreases with increasing magnetic field and is attributed to spin glass behavior .",
    "however in our case , the difference between zfcw and fcw increases with increasing magnetic field ( but less than critical field required for afm - fm transition at 5 k ) which rules out the presence of spin glass .",
    "the difference between zfcw and fcw curves reduces as the applied field becomes higher than 9 tesla because the isothermal afm to fm transition starts at 5 k , as shown in the r vs h curve in figure 5(a ) .",
    "consequently , at 14 tesla , system will be in fm state along zfcw curve also .",
    "these thermo - magnetic irreversibility ( tmi ) for resistivity in zfcw and fcw curves are similar to that observed across disorder broadened first - order magnetic transition in many other systems like doped @xmath49 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 etc .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "it has been attributed to critically slow dynamics of the transition due to which high temperature phase remains arrested down to the lowest temperature . to have some estimate of the fm phase fraction at 5 k we assumed that resistivity decreases linearly with increasing fm phase fraction and the resistivity values corresponding to fm state ( @xmath50 ) and afm state ( @xmath51 ) are taken as the 8 t fcw curve and 0 t ( zero field cooled ) curve resistivities at 5 k , respectively .",
    "with this assumption the quantity @xmath52 [ @xmath53/@xmath54 gives fm phase fraction at temperature @xmath55 and magnetic field @xmath56 . obtained @xmath52 at 5 k is shown as inset in figure 4 for both zfcw and fcw curve . for zfcw curve @xmath52",
    "remains zero for all the field values which indicates that the system is in homogeneous afm state at 5 k and applied magnetic field is not sufficient enough to induce afm to fm transition .",
    "whereas , in case of fcw curve it deviates from zfcw curve for @xmath57 t that shows increased fm phase fraction with increasing magnetic field . in case of 6 t , it indicates coexisting afm and fm phase and the state of the system depends on the path followed in @xmath58 space . on the other hand we could obtain almost homogeneous afm or fm state in presence of 8 t magnetic field depending on the cooling history .     below 50 k and [ b ] above 50",
    "k. increasing and decreasing magnetic field cycles are denoted by open and solid symbols respectively .",
    "upper right insets of both the graphs show the enlarged section of increasing field cycle whereas lower left inset correspond to decreasing field cycle .",
    "the forward curves ( @xmath59 t ) move to lower field values monotonically with increasing temperature ( @xmath60 k ) as highlighted by the curved arrows . whereas , the reverse curves ( 14 t @xmath61 ) move non - monotonically with temperature . below / above 50 k",
    ", it shifts to higher / lower field value with increasing temperature as highlighted by oppositely directed curved arrow in figure [ a ] and [ b ] respectively.,width=8 ]    since the isothermal application of 8 t magnetic field at 5 k does not show any field induced afm - fm transition for a zero field cooled sample , we used ppms for measurement up to 14 t to study this transition isothermally below @xmath6 .",
    "these measurements were carried out in transverse geometry .",
    "we cross checked results of these measurements with the measurement of longitudinal geometry using 8 t magnet system .",
    "we found similar behavior in both the geometries except slightly higher mr magnitude ( @xmath62 ) and higher critical field ( difference @xmath63 t ) in transverse geometry though the trend remains same .",
    "for these isothermal mr measurement , sample was cooled under zero field from well above @xmath6 to the lowest temperature ( 2 k ) of the measurement .",
    "all the measurements have been done during subsequent warming in such a way that the every next higher temperature measurement was performed after completion of previous low temperature measurement .",
    "the results of these measurements are shown in figure 5 . with the application of magnetic field ,",
    "a field induced transition from afm to fm phase is observed as a sharp change in mr .",
    "for all the temperatures , giant mr @xmath64 is observed across afm to fm transition .",
    "the reverse transformation occurs at lower field value resulting in a hysteretic field dependence of mr . during decreasing magnetic field",
    ", system recovers its initial resistivity value at 0 t , which indicates complete reverse transformation from fm to afm phase .",
    "this high mr is observed when system is prepared under zero field condition and magnetic field is cycled back to zero .",
    "whereas in figure 4 it has been shown that if the sample is prepared in fc state same large mr would not be observed .",
    "the right insets of fig 5 ( a ) and ( b ) shows that with increasing temperature , forward ( @xmath59 t ) curves shift monotonically to lower field side .",
    "however the return curves ( 14 t @xmath61 ) shift to higher field side up to 50 k ( left corner inset of fig.5(a ) ) and then to lower field side ( left corner inset of fig.5(b ) ) with increasing temperature .",
    "this behavior is similar to that observed in @xmath21 , where it is attributed to dominance of critically slow dynamics of the transition below 60 k @xcite .",
    "phase diagram obtained from isothermal mr measurements shown in figure 5 .",
    "inset highlights the non - monotonic variation of lower critical field and straight lines represent @xmath65 and @xmath66 band schematically.,width=8 ]    the variation of critical fields is more explicitly demonstrated in @xmath58 phase diagram ( figure 6 ) which is obtained from isothermal magnetoresistance shown in figure 5 .",
    "@xmath67 ( critical field required for afm to fm transition ) and @xmath68 ( critical field required for fm to afm transition ) are taken as inflection point of mr vs. @xmath56 curve during increasing and decreasing magnetic field respectively .",
    "this phase diagram shows that curve corresponding to @xmath67 varies monotonically with temperature , whereas @xmath68 varies non - monotonically with a shallow maxima around 50 k ( see inset of figure 6 ) .",
    "non - monotonic variation of lower critical field is addressed in @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite in terms of interplay between transformation kinetics and supercooling .",
    "this interplay is highlighted schematically in the inset of figure 6 for the present system .",
    "at low temperature ( below @xmath69 ) dynamics of the transition becomes critically slow and wins over thermodynamic transition .",
    "since dynamics of the transition dominates at low temperature , @xmath68 is determined by @xmath65 in this temperature region , in contrast to high temperature where it is determined by @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the positive slope region is representative of @xmath65 and the negative slope region is representative of @xmath70 . with this understanding of phase diagram",
    "it is obvious that transition field at which the free energy of both the fm and afm state becomes equal will be higher than the middle point of @xmath67 and @xmath68 at low temperatures .",
    "nonmonotonic variation of critical field is common in manganites where such glassy magnetic states are being extensively studied . in case of lpcmo where high temperature state is afm - charge order , wu et al . @xcite",
    "have identified this kinetic arrest line ( @xmath71 ) as @xmath72 ( glass transition ) line .",
    "so far we have shown that interplay of @xmath65 and @xmath66 give rise to coexisting afm and fm phases at low temperature and the phase fraction depends on the path followed in @xmath58 phase space .",
    "now question arises , which of these phases is the equilibrium phase . for this , chuf ( cooling and heating in unequal field ) protocol @xcite is used , the results of which are shown in figure 7 . under this protocol ,",
    "measurements during warming are carried out under a constant magnetic field after cooling the sample in the presence of different magnetic fields .",
    "if high field state happens to be non - equilibrium state then for cooling field higher than measuring field one observes a double ( reentrant ) transition and for smaller cooling field there will be only one transition .",
    "for the present system we cooled the system in the presence of 0 , 6 and 8 t field to 5 k. at 5 k , magnetic field is changed isothermally to 6 t and then measurement is performed during warming in the presence of 6 t magnetic field .",
    "the resistivity value at 5 k and 6 t depends on the cooling field , which shows the tunability of afm / fm phase fraction .",
    "cooling in higher field results in higher fm phase fraction .",
    "when the cooling field ( 0 t ) is lower then warming field ( 6 t ) , system shows only one transition i.e transformation from afm to fm state around 125 k. whereas two transitions appear when cooling field ( 8 t ) is higher than measuring field ( 6 t ) .",
    "corresponding magnetization curve ( cooled in 8 t and measured in 6 t warming ) in the inset of figure 7 also shows two transitions .",
    "it shows that low field state ( here afm ) is equilibrium phase and fm phase exist as glass like arrested phase . during warming in 6 t ( after cooling in 8 t ) an increase / decrease in the resistivity / magnetization at low temperature indicates devitrification of glass like fm phase into afm phase .",
    "the re - entrant transition , corresponding to melting of afm phase in to fm phase , is seen by a sharp fall / rise in resistivity / magnetization after crossing superheating band with further increase in the temperature .",
    "these results show that cooling in high magnetic field results in glass like fm state as the fm state obtained in this way remains arrested until system crosses @xmath65 band on lowering the magnetic field isothermally ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the origin of glass like arrested magnetic state is debatable even in manganites , where it has been subject matter of extensive investigation in recent years . like manganites",
    ", there is a delicate balance between af and fm interaction in ferh system .",
    "this can be seen in figure 2 , where we observe a sharp transition in annealed ( chemically ordered ) sample in contrast to broad features observed in the as cast sample .",
    "not only this band structure in afm and fm state are shown to be different .",
    "therefore there are strong coupling between magnetic , electronic and lattice degrees of freedom and afm - fm transition is sensitive to disorder , strain etc . in case of lpcmo sharma et al .",
    "@xcite has linked the glass formation to freezing of structural degrees of freedom . according to them potential mechanism for glass formation",
    "lies in the first order structural phase transition . in the present system",
    "also afm - fm transition is accompanied with large lattice volume change though the crystal structure symmetry remains same .",
    "the mfm study of manekar et al .",
    "around room temperature in ferh system has shown the growth of fm phase correlated with topology on a time scale of @xmath11 secs @xcite .",
    "we would like to caution here that the driving mechanism ( lattice or magnetic ) for first order transition in this system is yet to be identified .",
    "when the transition is shifted to lower temperature ( in the present system achieved by pd - doping and applying magnetic field ) the atomic motion is hindered at low temperature due to lower thermal energy .",
    "the effect of pd doping appears to be similar to metallic glass where melting temperature ( but not glass transition temperature ) is found to be strong function of composition @xcite .",
    "in fact even in the case of lpcmo thin film grown on different substrate , glass transition temperature appears to be less sensitive to substrate strain in comparison to afm - fm transition temperature @xcite .",
    "to conclude we have studied first order afm to fm transition at low temperature using detailed magnetotransport studies on @xmath0 .",
    "similar to abrupt vanishing of @xmath6 with transition metal doping @xcite , these studies show gradual decrease of transition temperature but only down to 50 k and absence of afm - fm transition below this temperature .",
    "non - monotonic variation of @xmath68 observed in isothermal mr measurement has been explained by the interplay of @xmath69 and @xmath66 band . at low temperature and high magnetic field , state of the system",
    "depends on the measurement history and can give rise to coexisting afm and fm state .",
    "nature of coexisting afm and fm phase has been studied by following novel paths in @xmath58 space which shows fm state as glas and its devitrification with increasing temperature .",
    "the observed glass like features in the studied system are similar to glassy magnetic states observed in manganites and related systems .",
    "the applicability of the concepts developed in these studies to the present system shows universality .",
    "further microscopic studies will be helpful in understanding the glassy behavior in these systems .",

    "<S> the first order antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition in the functional material @xmath0 has been studied at low temperatures and high magnetic fields . we have addressed the non - monotonic variation of lower critical field required for fm to afm transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that critically slow dynamics of the transition dominates below 50 k. at low temperature and high magnetic field , state of the system depends on the measurement history resulting in tunable coexistence of afm and fm phases . by following cooling and heating in unequal magnetic field ( chuf ) protocol </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that equilibrium state at 6 tesla magnetic field is afm state . </S>",
    "<S> glass like fm state at 6 t ( obtained after cooling in 8 t ) shows reentrant transition with increasing temperature ; viz . </S>",
    "<S> devitrification to afm state followed by melting to fm state . </S>"
