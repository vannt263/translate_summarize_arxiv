    "the problem of coexistence of superconducting and magnetic orderings has been studied for several decades ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "one can separate two basic mechanisms responsible for interaction of superconducting order parameter with magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic state : ( i ) the electromagnetic mechanism ( interaction of cooper pairs with magnetic field induced by magnetic moments ) which was first discussed by v.  l. ginzburg @xcite in 1956 ; ( ii ) the exchange interaction of magnetic moments with electrons in cooper pairs .",
    "the revival of interest to the fundamental questions of magnetism and superconductivity coexistence has been stimulated , in particular , by the recent investigations of the hybrid superconductor / ferromagnetic ( s / f ) systems .",
    "such thin film structures consist of a ferromagnetic insulator film and superconducting film deposited on it .",
    "similar situation can be obtained with a metallic ferromagnet when a superconducting film is evaporated on the buffer oxide layer in order to avoid proximity effect .",
    "the superconducting properties of such structures attract a growing interest due to a large potential for applications .",
    "in particular , such hybrid s / f systems are intensively investigated in connection with the problem of controlled flux pinning .",
    "the enhancement of the depinning critical current density @xmath1 has been observed experimentally for superconducting films with arrays of submicron magnetic dots , @xcite antidots , @xcite and for s / f bilayers with domain structure in ferromagnetic films .",
    "@xcite theory of vortex structures and pinning in the s / f systems at rather low magnetic fields ( in the london approximation ) has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    a nonhomogeneous magnetic field distribution induced by the domain structure in a ferromagnetic layer influences strongly the conditions of the superconducting order parameter nucleation , and , as a consequence , the hybrid s / f systems reveal a nontrivial phase diagram in an external applied magnetic field @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the theoretical study of this phase diagram on the basis of phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model .",
    "we assume that the electromagnetic mechanism mentioned above plays a dominant role and neglect the exchange interaction which is obviously suppressed provided superconducting and ferromagnetic layers are well separated by an insulating barrier .",
    "we also assume that the domain walls are well pinned and do not take account of changes in the domain structure with an increase in @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of the magnetic field induced by the domain structure is determined by the ratio of two length scales : thickness of ferromagnetic film @xmath4 and distance between the domain walls @xmath5 ( hereafter we neglect a finite width of the domain wall , i.e. consider this width to be much less than the superconducting coherence length ) .",
    "provided the ferromagnetic film is rather thick ( @xmath6 ) , the magnetic field in a thin superconducting film is almost homogeneous over the domain and suppresses the critical temperature of superconductivity nucleation . in this case with the decrease in the temperature the superconductivity must firstly appear just above the domain wall ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) due to the mechanism analogous to the one responsible for the surface superconductivity below @xmath7 ( see ref .",
    "thus , in this limit the domain walls stimulate the nucleation of the superconducting order parameter . note , that the same effect should reveal for two - dimensional magnetic field distributions induced , e.g. , by magnetic dots , and results in the dependence of the upper critical field on the angular momentum of the superconducting nucleus wave function ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for a thin ferromagnetic film ( @xmath8 ) the magnetic field decays with the increase in the distance from the domain wall and almost vanishes inside the domain . in the absence of the external field",
    "such domain wall should locally weaken superconductivity as it was discussed in ref .",
    "the superconducting nucleus in this case should appear far from the domain wall .",
    "as we switch on an external magnetic field , we can control the position of the superconducting nucleus suppressing the order parameter inside the domains .",
    "thus , the phase diagram of the s / f bilayer is generally determined by the interplay between the superconductivity nucleated at the domain walls and in between these walls . for small period domain structures ( when @xmath5 is comparable with the nucleus size ) this simple physical picture based on consideration of isolated superconducting nuclei should be modified taking account of the interaction between the superconducting nuclei localized above different domain walls .",
    "our further consideration is based on the linearized gl equation for the order parameter @xmath9 : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the vector potential , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the flux quantum , @xmath14 is the coherence length , and @xmath15 is the critical temperature of the bulk superconductor at @xmath16 . for superconducting films with thickness @xmath17 much smaller than coherence length",
    "the role of the parallel component of the magnetic field is negligibly small .",
    "thus , we can take account only of the magnetic field component @xmath18 perpendicular to the film surface and also neglect the dependence of the order parameter on @xmath19 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to the consideration of the one - dimensional case : @xmath20 , where @xmath3 is a uniform external magnetic field and @xmath21 is the @xmath19component of the field induced by the magnetization @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    choosing the gauge @xmath23",
    ", one can easily see that the momentum along the @xmath24 axis is conserved , hence we can find the solution of the schrdinger - like equation ( [ gl - vec ] ) in the form @xmath25 , where function @xmath26 should be determined from a solution of the one - dimensional problem : @xmath27    nontrivial solutions of eq.([gl - x ] ) exist only for a discrete set of temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 should be define as the highest value @xmath29 , corresponding to the lowest `` energy level '' @xmath30 of the schrdinger - like equation ( [ gl - x ] ) .",
    "let us start from consideration of a superconducting nucleus at a single domain wall taking the magnetization @xmath31 near the wall in the form : @xmath32 ( we assume that the domain wall width is much less than the superconducting coherence length ) .",
    "as it was mentioned above , for a rather thick ferromagnetic film ( @xmath33 ) the expression for the distribution of magnetic field near the surface reads : @xmath34 , where @xmath3 is an external applied magnetic field .",
    "we choose the gauge in the form : @xmath35 . at high temperatures the superconductivity far from the domain wall",
    "can be completely suppressed due to the orbital effect . on the contrary , near the boundary",
    "the superconducting nucleus can be still energetically favorable due to the mechanism analogous to the one responsible for the existence of @xmath7 critical field for superconducting nucleus near the superconductor - insulator interface ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . thus",
    ", a change of the magnetization direction which occurs at a domain boundary is responsible for a partial decrease of the orbital effect which provides conditions for the formation of localized superconducting nuclei at the domain walls at high temperatures ( above the critical temperature far from the walls ) .",
    "such a localized nucleus can appear only if we take account of proximity effect , i.e. consider the cooper pairs to exist on both sides of the domain boundary .",
    "such systems can reveal an interesting behavior in an external magnetic field .",
    "an external magnetic field applied to the sample results in a partial compensation of the field above one of the domains . as a result ,",
    "the critical temperature of superconductor can depend nonmonotoneously on the applied magnetic field .",
    "both the critical temperature of superconductivity nucleation far from the domain wall and critical temperature of formation of localized superconductivity at the wall should increase up to the external field value equal to the magnetic induction induced by the ferromagnetic moment .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite equation ( [ gl - x ] ) in the following dimensionless form :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the value @xmath42 characterizes the shift of critical temperature due to the orbital mechanism , and @xmath43 is the maximum absolute value of the field @xmath44 ( in this subsection @xmath45 ) .    for the case @xmath46 a superconducting nucleus will appear far from the domain boundary at a certain @xmath47 . in this limit the lowest eigenvalue @xmath48 of equation ( [ gl3 ] ) and ,",
    "hence , the critical temperature is not disturbed by the presence of the domain boundary . on the contrary , for finite @xmath49 values the superconducting nuclei to the left and to the right from the domain wall",
    "can not be considered separately due to the proximity effect .",
    "provided the lowest energy level in the resulting potential well in equation ( [ gl3 ] ) is minimal for a certain finite @xmath50 coordinate , we get a superconducting nucleus localized at the domain boundary for temperatures above @xmath47 .",
    "the mechanism resulting in the appearance of such localized nucleus is analogous to the one responsible for existence of the surface superconductivity at the superconductor / insulator boundary for magnetic fields @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath52 the potential well @xmath53 in schrdinger equation ( [ gl3 ] ) is symmetric ( @xmath54 ) and the eigenvalue problem ( [ gl3 ] ) can be considered only for @xmath55 with the boundary condition @xmath56 . for this particular case",
    "the energy minimum corresponds to @xmath57 ( ref .",
    "an increase in the @xmath58 value will obviously result in an increasing asymmetry of the well @xmath53 , and , thus , in the suppression of superconductivity localized at the domain wall .",
    "the equation ( [ gl3 ] ) can be solved exactly in terms of weber functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath59 @xmath60 here @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants , and the weber function @xmath63 is the solution of the following equation : @xmath64 with the boundary condition @xmath65 . matching these solutions at @xmath66 we obtain :    @xmath67    this equation can be solved numerically which allows us to obtain the function @xmath68 . the resulting dependence of the critical temperature of superconductivity nucleation on parameter @xmath58 is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "one can see that the external field suppresses the localized superconducting nuclei and the superconductivity localized at the domain wall exists only at a relatively weak applied field . as we increase an external field the superconducting nucleus shifts away from the domain wall towards the region where the absolute value of the total magnetic field is minimal . for @xmath69 the curve @xmath70 calculated numerically",
    "can be fitted by the following simple expression : @xmath71      in this subsection we proceed with consideration of another limiting case @xmath8 and consider the problem of superconductivity nucleation in the field of an isolated domain wall in a thin ferromagnetic film : @xmath72 .",
    "obviously , for rather weak external magnetic fields @xmath73 ( in this subsection the maximum value of the domain wall field at @xmath74 is given by the expression @xmath75 ) the superconducting order parameter nucleates in the region near the point @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "provided the localization length @xmath78 of the superconducting nucleus is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of magnetic field distribution , we can expand vector potential as @xmath79 such a local approximation is valid if the following conditions are fulfilled : @xmath80 introducing a new coordinate @xmath81 we obtain the dimensionless equation @xmath82 @xmath83{\\frac{\\phi_0}{\\pi|b_z'(x_0)| } }   = d\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi md^2\\sin^2(h/4 m ) } } \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath84 @xmath85   { \\frac{\\phi_0}{\\pi b_z'(x_0)}}\\left(k-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\phi_0}a(x_0)\\right).\\ ] ]    the lowest eigenvalue of eq.([dim - less ] ) @xmath86 is achieved at @xmath87 . for the critical temperature @xmath0 of superconductivity nucleation",
    "we obtain :    @xmath88    this expression is valid when @xmath89    note that close to @xmath15 the upper critical field has an unusual temperature dependence : @xmath90 .",
    "as we increase an external magnetic field @xmath3 the position of superconducting nucleus shifts from infinity to the domain wall at @xmath91 . for rather large fields @xmath3 the nucleus appears to be localized at the domain wall .",
    "thus , the behavior of the nucleus coordinate in an external field is an opposite to the one considered in the subsection [ 2a ] . the critical temperature for high field @xmath3 limit is given by the expression @xmath92 the simple asymptotical formulas given above are in a good agreement with our numerical simulations of eq.([gl - x ] ) ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .    for numerical analysis of the localized states of schrdinger - like equation ( [ gl - x ] ) with an external magnetic field we approximated it on a equidistant grid and obtained the eigenfunctions @xmath26 and eigenvalues @xmath30 by the diagonalization method of tridiagonal difference scheme",
    ". the typical behavior of the ground state wavefunction is shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "in this section we consider the effect of interaction of cooper pair wavefunctions nucleated at different domain walls .",
    "surely such interaction is important only for temperatures close to @xmath15 ( @xmath93 ) , otherwize for a rather large domain size @xmath94 the overlapping of superconducting nuclei above different domain walls is exponentially small . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider here the case @xmath95 and take the step - like distribution of magnetic field induced by the domain structure with the period @xmath96 : @xmath97 , for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is an integer .",
    "the corresponding vector potential can be chosen in the form : @xmath101 for @xmath98 and @xmath102 .    in the absence of external field the general solution of eq.([gl - x ] ) meets the bloch theorem : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a quasimomentum .",
    "the nodeless wavefunction of the ground state corresponds to the value @xmath105 and is an even function of @xmath106 , and , thus , we obtain @xmath107 .",
    "so we conclude that the solution at zero external field is identical to the one describing the superconductivity nucleation in a superconducting film of the thickness @xmath5 in the uniform magnetic field @xmath43 . following ref . @xcite we can obtain the ground state wavefunctions and energy @xmath108 as a function of the momentum @xmath109 .",
    "the behavior of the resulting dependence of @xmath110 strongly depends on the parameter @xmath111 .",
    "two different regimes could be realized : for small values of @xmath112 there is only one minimum of @xmath110 at @xmath113 , which corresponds to the superconductivity nucleation above the domain center . for larger values of @xmath111 one obtains two minima with equal energies @xmath114 at @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) . for @xmath118",
    "the coordinates of these minima @xmath115 and @xmath116 and minimum energy @xmath114 approach the values corresponding to the ones for isolated domain walls ( see subsection [ 2a ] ) .",
    "depending on the @xmath109-momentum value the superconducting nuclei appear either above the walls at @xmath119 ( for @xmath115 ) or at @xmath120 ( for @xmath116 ) .",
    "thus , the nuclei at neighboring domain walls do not interact within the linearized gl theory .",
    "the dependence of the critical temperature on the field @xmath43 in a periodic domain structure is described by the formula : @xmath121 where the function @xmath122 coincides with that for a superconducting film in the uniform magnetic field @xmath43 which is plotted , e.g. , in ref .",
    "for a finite domain thickness @xmath5 the critical temperature @xmath123 appears to be larger than the one for a single domain wall .",
    "this difference in @xmath0 becomes rather large for small values @xmath124 when the nucleus is not localized near the domain boundary . for large @xmath19 values one can obtain :",
    "@xmath125 , which corresponds to the dependence @xmath123 for a nucleus at a single domain wall .",
    "if we apply an external magnetic field @xmath3 the bloch theorem is no more valid and the solution @xmath26 appears to be localized . the energy level @xmath110 becomes a periodic function of the momentum @xmath109 : @xmath126 .",
    "the behavior of the upper critical field and structure of superconducting nuclei are controlled by the parameter @xmath111 .",
    "the results of our calculations carried out using the same numerical scheme as in subsection [ model ] are shown in fig.[fig5 ] .    for large values",
    "@xmath111 the phase transition line is very close to the one found in the subsection [ 2a ] , except for the small temperature region close to @xmath15 : @xmath127 . outside this narrow temperature interval ( and for @xmath73 ) the wavefunction",
    "is localized at the domain walls ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "the coordinates of these localized nuclei shift at @xmath128 as we change the momentum at @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is an integer ) .",
    "let us note , that for rather weak magnetic fields @xmath73 we observed a very peculiar behavior of the order parameter for a discrete set of field values given by the condition @xmath131 : the ground state wavefunction @xmath132 has a two peak structure ( see fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "this fact is a natural consequence of the equivalence of the momenta @xmath109 and @xmath133 and the resulting resonant interaction of nuclei localized at domain walls separated by the distance @xmath134 .    for not very large values",
    "@xmath135 the critical temperature becomes a monotonic function of the external magnetic field because of the strong overlapping of wavefunctions corresponding to different domains .",
    "therefore , the wavefunction is no more localized in a single domain ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "however , even in this case we still observe a change in the slope of the phase transition line ( see dash line in fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the upper critical field discussed above is not specific for step - like field distributions . to demonstrate this fact we studied the superconductivity nucleation for the field profile @xmath136 .",
    "the phase diagram on the plane @xmath137 appears to be qualitatively similar to the one shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the critical temperature is a monotonic function of the external magnetic field for @xmath138 . for large parameters @xmath139 and",
    "@xmath73 the behavior of the critical temperature can be analyzed analytically following the approach used in subsection [ model ] .",
    "the characteristic size of a superconducting nucleus and the critical temperature of superconductivity nucleation are given by the expressions : @xmath140{\\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi^2b_0a^2 } }   \\left(1-\\frac{h^2}{b_0 ^ 2}\\right)^{-1/6 } ,   \\\\",

    "to summarize , we investigated the conditions of nucleation of localized superconductivity at the domain boundaries in hybrid s / f systems .",
    "the appearance of these localized superconducting nuclei should result in a broadening of the superconducting transition probed , e.g. , by the resistivity measurements .",
    "we predict different regimes for the temperature dependence of the upper critical field near @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover between these regimes could be easily seen on experiment .",
    "in fact , the beginning of the resistivity decrease with the temperature decrease would correspond to the domain wall superconductivity , while its complete disappearance would signal the bulk superconductivity .",
    "external magnetic field would shrink the region of the domain wall superconductivity .",
    "let us discuss some estimates of the physical parameters for the systems where the nucleation of superconductivity at domain boundaries could be observable .",
    "we can take , for example , the parameters of @xmath142 ( @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) and typical values of magnetization for ferromagnetic insulators @xmath145 .",
    "the resulting increase in the critical temperature above a domain wall is quite strong : @xmath146 .",
    "the thickness of a superconducting film must be much smaller than the distance between domains and ideal conditions correspond to the thickness of the order of several coherence lengths .",
    "so we conclude that the effects discussed above may be easily observed and could be quite important .",
    "note that the behavior observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for s / f bilayers with bubble domains in a ferromagnetic film is qualitatively similar to our predictions .",
    "generally the temperature behaviour of the critical field in s / f structures can be very rich ( see figs.[fig2],[fig3],[fig5 ] ) and it is strongly dependent on the domain structure and method of determination of the critical field .",
    "careful measurements of the resistive and magnetic transition ( including the measurements of the transition broadening ) on the samples with a controllable domain structure would be very useful for the interpretation of the phase diagram and could give an important information on the domain wall superconductivity .",
    "note in conclusion , that the existence of localized superconducting channels near the domain walls in s / f heterostructures can provide an interesting possibility to realize a switching behavior provided we can move the ferromagnetic domain wall .",
    "the superconducting channel in this case should follow the motion of the domain wall , which provides a possibility to control the conductance between certain static leads .",
