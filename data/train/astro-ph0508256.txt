    "water is an important molecule to study during the formation of solar type stars for several reasons .",
    "it is one of the most abundant molecules in the material surrounding a forming star , and it is the most abundant molecule after h@xmath3 and co in the innermost regions of the low mass protostellar envelopes .",
    "since water has a very large dipole moment , it is a very efficient coolant of the gas , and can therefore dominate its thermal balance @xcite . finally , because it can be a major reservoir of the oxygen element",
    ", water also regulates the chemistry of other less abundant oxygen - bearing molecules .",
    "deuterated water in solar type forming stars is also important because of the link with the comets and the earth oceans . until recently , it was thought that the terrestrial water came from the outer ( @xmath4 au ) solar system , brought by colliding bodies after the earth formation @xcite .",
    "this theory is now challenged by a new class of dynamical simulations which theorize on the simultaneous formation of the oceans and the earth @xcite , but these ideas are still much debated . a key indicator in the puzzle about the ocean formation is provided by the so - called standard mean ocean water ( smow ) hdo / h@xmath3o ratio ( table [ tab : hdo ] ) .",
    "this value is about ten times larger than the elemental deuterium / hydrogen ratio in the solar nebula , and similar to the values measured in comets and carbonaceous chondrites ( table [ tab : hdo ] ) .",
    "the origin of the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in both comets and meteorites is also very debated @xcite .",
    "it is often compared to what is observed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , either in the cold clouds from where stars form or in the hot cores of _ massive _ protostars , which possess hdo / h@xmath3o values close to the smow @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations in protostars with _ masses similar to the sun _ measure a hdo / h@xmath3o value larger than the smow by about two orders of magnitude , so that the match is likely a coincidence .",
    "therefore , the question about the origin of the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in comets , asteroids and the oceans is still open . in particular",
    ", it is not clear whether the hdo / h@xmath3o is preserved during the last phase before the formation of the planetary system , the phase of the proto - planetary disk .",
    "and no direct observations exists so far of the water content and/or the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in systems similar to the progenitor of the solar system .",
    "molecular deuteration in the ism and in star forming regions has recently been the target of a flurry of activity , initiated by the discovery of multiply deuterated molecules in solar - type protostars , where d / h ratios are enhanced by up to 13 orders of magnitude with respect to the elemental d / h ratio .",
    "this extreme enrichment occurs during the initial stages of cloud collapse in the pre - stellar - phase @xcite .",
    "low temperatures and high densities lead to freeze - out of the molecules onto the grain mantles , and to enhanced deuteration of h@xmath5 , the most abundant molecular ion in such a gas , which `` transmits '' the deuteration to the other molecules . in the subsequent protostar phase , heating of the dust",
    "leads to the sublimation of ices in the inner @xmath6100 au , injecting ice molecules back into the gas phase .",
    "water , however , seems to follow a different path .",
    "while the abundance of singly deuterated isotopomers of h@xmath3co and ch@xmath7oh are more than 1/3 of the the main isotopomers , hdo is less than 3% of h@xmath3o in solar - type protostars . specifically , hdo / h@xmath3o is equal to 0.03 in the region where water ices sublimate , and less than 0.002 in the outer envelope , where the water abundance is dominated by gas - phase reactions .",
    "the reason for this different behavior most likely lies in the formation process . since water has a large dipole , it freezes out onto the grain mantles already at @xmath8 k @xcite .",
    "therefore the reactions forming water and water ice can occur at relatively high temperatures , when the h@xmath5 deuteration is limited . on the other hand , formaldehyde and methanol",
    "are believed to be formed by hydrogenation of frozen co .",
    "since the condensation temperature of co is @xmath9 k @xcite , this forces these reactions to take place at very low temperatures . under those conditions ,",
    "the enhanced d / h of the accreting atomic gas leads to high deuterium fractionation of molecules formed by co hydrogenation on grains ( e.g. tielens & hagen 1982 ) .",
    "after the dispersion of the protostar envelope , a proto - planetary disk is left over from which asteroids , comets and planets may form .",
    "the key questions to answer to improve our understanding of the origin of the terrestrial water are : is there enough h@xmath3o and hdo in a proto - planetary disk ( similar to what could have been the solar nebula ) to account for the water and ice present in the solar system ?",
    "what is the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio across the disk ? is the hdo / h@xmath3o of the pre - collapse and embedded protostar phases preserved during the proto - planetary disk phase ? and",
    ", ultimately , what is the origin of deuteration in comets , meteorites and oceans ?    in this letter we report the discovery of deuterated water in the disk surrounding dmtau , a t tauri star at 140 pc from the sun . an extended disk of molecular gas has been first discovered by . subsequently carried out a survey of different molecules .",
    "the dust disk mass is @xmath10 m@xmath11 , and the age is estimated to be around 5 myr .",
    "finally , the disk has a diameter of @xmath12 (= 800 au in radius ) .",
    "the ground ( 1@xmath130@xmath14 ) transition of hdo at @xmath15 = 464.92452 ghz was observed on february 20 , 22 and 28 , 2005 with the jcmt near the summit of mauna kea in hawaii , usa . the observations were performed with the dual - polarization w(c ) receiver in single - sideband mode . at the time of the observations , only one polarization was active .",
    "it was connected to a unit of an autocorrelator providing a bandwidth of 250 mhz for a spectral resolution of 156 khz for some scans , and a bandwidth of 500 mhz for a spectral resolution of 312 khz for others .",
    "all data were smoothed to the lowest spectral resolution , yielding a velocity resolution of about 0.2 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the observations were performed in beam switching mode with a throw of @xmath17 . pointing and",
    "focus were regularly checked using planets or strong sources , providing a pointing accuracy of about @xmath18 .",
    "the telescope beam at 464 ghz is @xmath19 , and the main beam efficiency is 0.45 ( as reported on the jcmt manual : http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jcmt/spectral_line/ ) .",
    "the data have been reduced with the gildas package class .",
    "the total integration time spent on the source was about 7.2 hours with a zenith @xmath20 opacity at 225 ghz better than 0.06 .",
    "nevertheless , some scans were taken at a high zenith angle , yielding to drift in calibration , and higher noise .",
    "we therefore dropped the scans with observed @xmath20 @xmath21 0.23 to build the final used dataset .",
    "the integration time of this final dataset is 5.5 hours , and the main beam temperature rms is equal to 33 mk in a 0.2 km s@xmath16 bin .",
    "figure [ fig : hdo ] shows the spectrum observed towards dm tau .",
    "two absorption features are detected with a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio better than 3 : the first one coincides exactly with the ground transition of hdo ( at 464.9245 ghz ) when the systemic velocity ( 5.5 km s@xmath16 ) of dm tau is taken into account .",
    "the other absorption feature at 11 km s@xmath16 is due to a c@xmath22h transition at 464.9172 ghzh identification is firmly established thanks to the presence of another absorption feature at 465.0511 ghz from the same molecule in the spectrum , and to the detection of the same two c@xmath22h lines towards another disk source , during the same observation run ( dominik et al . in preparation ) . ] . in order to check the robustness of the detection",
    ", we analyzed all the obtained data in multiple subsets of data , and the absorptions feature are present in all of them , regardless of the definition of the datasets .",
    "this test ensures that the features are indeed the result of summing all the spectra and not due to a strong fluctuation in a few ones .",
    "all together , this gives substantial support to the reality of the hdo absorption .",
    "we postpone the discussion about the c@xmath22h detection to a forthcoming article ( dominik et al . in preparation ) . here",
    "we focus on the hdo detection , the first ever in a proto - planetary disk .",
    "the velocity - integrated hdo line is ( @xmath23 ) k km s@xmath16 ( main beam temperature ) , and the linewidth is ( 0.63@xmath240.18 ) km s@xmath16 .    a continuum at 464 ghz of @xmath25 jy , derived by modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed : see figure [ fig : sed ] and the text below ) , gives a line to continuum ratio of 0.9 ( i.e. the relative depth of the absorption line is close to 1 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an absorbing hdo column density equal to @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "this number is based on the assumption that all hdo molecules are in the ground state , which is a valid assumption for the involved gas temperature and density . the uncertainty associated with the derived line to continuum ratio and hdo column density is around a factor 2 , when considering the uncertainty in the modeling and the observed line absorption ( close to unity ) .",
    "however , the line may be optically thick and , in which case the derived column density would be a lower limit to the real hdo column density .",
    "in order to correctly interpret the meaning of the hdo line , the first question to answer is : what is the location of the hdo molecules causing the absorption ?",
    "is it gas in the ( cold ) upper layers of the outer disk ( r@xmath2830 au ) , or gas in the ( warm ) midplane close to the star ?",
    "the answer to this question is straightforward .",
    "the photons which are absorbed by the hdo molecules in the line of sight are emitted by cold dust ( @xmath29 k ) , therefore by dust in the outer midplane . as a consequence ,",
    "_ the hdo molecules must be in the gas above the outer midplane_. furthermore , because the line - to - continuum ratio is close to unity , _ the hdo gas must cover most of the disk_. finally , the fact that the line is in absorption and not in emission implies that the gas with hdo has a relatively low density , below the critical density of the transition .",
    "the latter is @xmath30 @xmath2 at 20 k .",
    "_ we conclude that hdo ( and therefore h@xmath3o ) vapor is present in the outer disk above the midplane , at a density less than @xmath31 @xmath2_. since only the gas towards us absorbs the 464 ghz photons , the total hdo molecules are twice the hdo column density required to absorb the continuum , namely n(hdo)@xmath32 @xmath27 , to account for the other side of the disk .",
    "this implies a gaseous hdo mass in the disk equal to @xmath33 gr , which is about 850 times the amount of hdo in the terrestrial oceans . again , if the line is optically thick , all numbers are lower limits .    figure [ fig : struct ] shows the physical structure of dm tau , derived by modeling the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) . for",
    "that we used a passive disk model with an inner hole @xcite , computed with 1 + 1d treatment of radiative transfer and self - consistent vertical structure . in `` standard '' conditions , h@xmath3o molecules",
    "condense out onto the grain mantles at a rate : @xmath34 and are released back into the gas phase by thermal evaporation , at a rate ( hasegawa & herbst 1993 ) : @xmath35\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath36 is the sticking coefficient , @xmath37 is the mean grain radius ( 0.1 @xmath38 m ) , @xmath39 is the grain number density ( with respect to h@xmath3 , equal to @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 is the h@xmath3o thermal velocity . in eq .",
    "( [ kev ] ) , @xmath42s@xmath16 is the frequency of oscillation between adsorbate and surface and @xmath43 is the binding energy per molecule .",
    "note that , in contrast to co , cosmic rays do not contribute significantly to the release of h@xmath3o from the ice @xcite . taking the standard value for the sticking coefficient ( larger than 0.3 ) , and the h@xmath3o binding energy measured by laboratory experiments ( @xmath44 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads to all the water frozen onto the grain mantles at a distance larger of @xmath45 au in much less than the estimated age of dm tau ( @xmath46 myr ) .",
    "this is a well known effect in the literature of the solar nebula studies , giving rise to the `` snow - line '' @xcite .",
    "therefore no vapor water should be present in the outer disk .",
    "however , _ we do observe hdo in the gas phase , in significant quantities and this is the first important conclusion of the present work .",
    "_    in order to compute the hdo abundance , we need to estimate the h@xmath3 column density in the region where the absorbing hdo is located . using the physical structure derived from the sed modeling ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) , the h@xmath3 column density of the gas at 600 - 800 au is about @xmath47 @xmath27 , if the gas is located at a height of about 300 au ( corresponding to a density of @xmath1 @xmath2 ) .",
    "if the hdo absorption is located closer to the midplane , at densities @xmath48 @xmath2 , the h@xmath3 column density would be a factor three larger . in the unlikely case ( see below ) that the absorption originates higher in the disk , the h@xmath3 column density could be a factor three lower .",
    "this implies a hdo abundance ( with respect to h@xmath3 ) of @xmath0 , with an uncertainty of about a factor three , depending how deep in the disk the hdo gas lies .",
    "unfortunately , observations of h@xmath3o are impossible from the ground , and we need to wait for the advent of the herschel space observatory for an actual measure of the h@xmath3o abundance in the gas phaseo abundance is much larger than @xmath49 . ] .",
    "however , we can compare the derived hdo abundance with the observations of h@xmath3o in molecular clouds and protostars , @xmath50 , and this would give hdo / h@xmath3o equal to @xmath51 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the water abundance is lower and more similar to what is measured in cold molecular clouds , @xmath52 @xcite , the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio would be larger than 0.3 .",
    "therefore , the second conclusion of the present work is that _ the vapor hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in the proto - planetary disk surrounding dm tau is probably larger than 0.01 , unless the abundance of the water is larger than @xmath50 . _    in summary",
    ", the hdo detection proves that water vapor is present in the outer disk , in the layers above the midplane where the temperature is lower than about 25 k and density is , within a factor ten , @xmath1 @xmath2 , and that the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio is likely larger than 0.01 .",
    "we explore now what this implies .",
    "first , the timescale for condensation of water molecules at @xmath53 @xmath2 is @xmath54 yr ( eq . [ eq:1 ] ) , whereas the estimated age of the disk is of a few million years .",
    "therefore , the condensation of water molecules onto grains is either slowed down significantly , or countered by continuously `` sublimation '' of the icy grain mantles .",
    "we are not aware of any physical process capable of slowing down condensation of water onto the grain mantles .",
    "we therefore consider the possible mechanisms that would make the icy grain mantles sublimate .",
    "the first possibility is that uv photons photo - desorb the icy mantles . where uv photons penetrate",
    ", they also photo - dissociate the water molecules , keeping the steady - state abundance of water molecules low and limited to a narrow region .",
    "it is unclear whether the resulting column density is enough to explain the observations .",
    "shocks from possible turbulent mixing from the low to the upper layers ( vertical mixing ) would be too slow ( @xmath55 km s@xmath16 ) and weak to give any appreciable effect .",
    "the same applies to any accretion shock in the outer disk .",
    "another possibility is that x - rays spot - heat the grain mantles making part of them sublimate @xcite .",
    "indeed , t tau stars are known to be strong x - rays emitters , and a preliminary analysis of chandra observations suggests x - rays emission associated with dm tau ( m. guedel , private communication ) . thus , x - rays would be , in this sense , a natural explanation ( see also @xcite ) , although it is difficult to quantify the amount of sublimated ice .",
    "finally , table 1 lists the measurements of the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in objects representing different stages of the formation of a solar type star , compared to the measurements in the solar system .",
    "although the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in comets and carbon chondrites is 10 times larger than the elemental d / h ratio , it is much smaller than the value observed during the protostellar phase of a solar type star , and , likely , also smaller than the value measured during the final phase , namely the proto - planetary disk phase .",
    "however , our observations strictly refer to the outer disk , at a scale much larger than where comets and carbon meteorits are thought to originate .",
    "therefore , it will be paramount to have the _ spatial distribution _ of the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio across the proto - planetary disks .",
    "our observations show that these studies can be done searching for the _ absorption _ of the ground state of hdo and , likely , h@xmath3o lines .",
    "the future interferometric instrument alma will represent a unique opportunity for these studies . as a final remark",
    ", the present study confirms that caution is mandatory in linking the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in solar system objects to star forming environments .",
    "we wish to thank the jcmt staff for their precious help in doing the observations , and particularly j.hough for his enthusiasm .",
    "we acknowledge m.van den ancker for a de - reddened sed of dm tau , k.dullemond for his help in constructing the disk model , and m.guedel for the information about the x - rays emission of dm tau .",
