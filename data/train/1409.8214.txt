    "this paper is concerned with the cauchy problem for the semilinear radial wave equation in @xmath0 dimensions @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radial variable and @xmath7 . for concretness",
    ", we shall focus on two specific and particularly interesting cases : @xmath8 which correspond to equivariant wave maps from the @xmath0dimensional minkowski spacetime into the @xmath1-sphere and an @xmath9 symmetric yang - mills field in the @xmath10dimensional minkowski spacetime , respectively ( see e.g. @xcite for the derivation ) .",
    "the basic question for equation is whether solutions starting from smooth initial data can become singular ( `` blow up '' ) in finite time and , if so , how does the blowup occur .",
    "the key feature , which plays a major role in answering this question , is the scale invariance of eq . with respect to the scaling tranformation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a positive constant . under this scaling the conserved energy @xmath13 where @xmath14 , transforms as @xmath15 , which means that eq .",
    "is energy critical for @xmath16 and supercritical for @xmath17 .",
    "the critical case @xmath16 has been intensively studied for the past decades leading to good understanding of the mechanism of blowup .",
    "most notably , struwe proved that singularities necessarily have the form of self - shrinking harmonic maps ( hence nonexistence of harmonic maps implies global regularity ) and the rate of shrinking is faster than self - similar @xcite .",
    "for the nonlinearities the generic rates of shrinking were derived formally in @xcite and proved rigorously in @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the supercritical case @xmath17 is much less satisfactory .",
    "all known examples of blowup involve self - similar solutions @xcite , however it is not known if singularities _ must _ be self - similar . for @xmath18 and the nonlinearities , the self - similar blowup was proved ( under a certain spectral condition ) to be stable @xcite and demonstrated numerically to be generic @xcite . in higher dimensions , as far as we know , nothing was known in even dimensions while for odd @xmath19 some self - similar solutions have been constructed @xcite but their stability and role in dynamics have not been studied .",
    "in this paper we present new explicit self - similar solutions of eq . in all dimensions",
    "@xmath2 ( section  2 ) , analyze their linear stability ( section  3 ) , and finally give numerical evidence that they play the role of universal attractors in the generic blowup ( section  4 ) .",
    "by definition , self - similar solutions are invariant under the scaling , that is @xmath20 , hence they have the form @xmath21 where a positive constant @xmath22 , clearly allowed by the time translation symmetry , is introduced for later convenience . inserting this ansatz into eq .",
    "one obtains the ordinary differential equation @xmath23 we are interested in solutions that are smooth on the closed interval @xmath24 , which corresponds to the interior of the past light cone of the point @xmath25 . for such solutions @xmath26 hence the @xmath27-th derivative at the origin ( such that @xmath28 ) diverges as @xmath29",
    "thus , each self - similar solution @xmath30 $ ] is an example of a singularity developing in finite time from smooth initial data .",
    "we found the following explicit solutions of eq .",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 for @xmath18 these solutions have been known @xcite , however for @xmath2 they appear to be new .",
    "in particular , the only smooth self - similar solutions obtained previously , for @xmath33 ( wm ) and @xmath34 ( ym ) , by variational @xcite and shooting @xcite methods are different from @xmath35 .",
    "for both these methods it was essential that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the convexity radius of the target manifold , equal to @xmath38 for ( wm ) and 1 for ( ym ) .",
    "in contrast , for our solutions @xmath39 when @xmath2 .",
    "a complete classification of smooth solutions of eq . for @xmath2 is not an easy problem ; the main difficulty being due to an involved smoothness condition at @xmath40 ( see section 2.2 in @xcite for the analysis of this condition in odd dimensions ) . fortunately , this hard ode problem need not concern us here because , as will be shown in section  4 , smooth solutions other than @xmath35 do not seem to participate in the generic blowup , presumably due to their instabilities .",
    "clearly , solutions similar to @xmath35 exist for a variety of nonlinearities other than ( albeit not in an explicit form , of course ) .",
    "in particular , by modifying for @xmath41 one can construct analogous smooth solutions for convex targets using the shooting method of @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare the problem of blowup for eq . with the analogous problem for the heat flow @xmath42 with the same nonlinearities",
    "this equation has self - similar blowup solutions for @xmath43 ( wm ) @xcite and @xmath44 ( ym ) @xcite but no such solutions exist in higher dimensions @xcite . in accordance with that , it was found that the blowup for eq .",
    "changes character from self - similar @xcite to non - self - similar @xcite in sufficiently high dimensions .",
    "as the first step towards understanding the role of the self - similar solution @xmath45 in dynamics we need to analyze its linear stability . to this end it is convenient to define a new time coordinate @xmath46 and rewrite eq . in terms of @xmath47 @xmath48 in these variables",
    "the problem of finite time blowup in converted into the problem of asymptotic convergence for @xmath49 towards the stationary solution @xmath50 . following the standard procedure",
    "we seek solutions of eq . in the form @xmath51 .",
    "dropping nonlinear terms we get the quadratic eigenvalue equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 we consider the eigenvalue problem on the interval @xmath24 . by assumption ,",
    "the solution @xmath54 is smooth for @xmath55 , hence we we demand that @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this condition leads to the quantization of the eigenvalues .    in order to determine the analyticity properties of solutions of eq .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 for ( wm ) and @xmath62 , @xmath63 for ( ym ) .",
    "this change of variables brings eq . into the canonical form of the heun equation @xcite @xmath64 where in the case of ( wm )",
    "@xmath65 and in the case of ( ym ) @xmath66 equation has four regular singularities at @xmath67 .",
    "the characteristic exponents at @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the regular solutions at @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by the local heun functions ( using the maple notation ) @xmath74 the eigenvalues are given by zeros of the wronskian @xmath75(\\lambda):=w_1'(x ) w_2(x)-w_2'(x ) w_1(x)\\,.\\ ] ] unfortunately , the connection problem for the heun equation is unresolved and therefore ( in contrast to the hypergeometric equation ) no explicit formula for the wronskian is available .",
    "fortunately , the heun functions are built into maple and the zeros of the wronskian can be computed numerically with great precision .",
    "the results of this computation are displayed in table  1 ( wm ) and table  2 ( ym ) .",
    "we remark that the eigenvalue @xmath76 is due to the freedom of changing the blowup time @xmath22 and does not correspond to any instability .",
    "the fact that the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath77 has no zeros can be used to exclude rigorously eigenvalues with @xmath78 ( see @xcite for the proof in @xmath18 ) , however it seems hard to prove the nonexistence of eigenvalues with @xmath79 .",
    "nonetheless , we feel confident that if such an eigenvalue existed , we would have found it numerically .",
    "consequently , we assume that all the eigenvalues but @xmath80 have negative real part . from this assumption",
    "it follows that the solution @xmath35 is linearly asymptotically stable @xcite .",
    "[ qnm ]    [ qnm ]",
    "in the lowest supercritical dimension @xmath18 donninger proved that the linear asymptotic stability of @xmath35 implies its nonlinear asymptotic stability @xcite .",
    "it seems feasible that this result can be generalized to higher dimensions @xmath2 but we are not qualified to pursue this issue .",
    "we conjecture that the solution @xmath35 is not only nonlinearly stable but , in fact , it is a universal attractor for generic blowup .",
    "the numerical evidence for this conjecture in the case @xmath18 was given in @xcite ; here we give an analogous evidence for @xmath2 .",
    "consider a solution @xmath81 of eq . that starts from smooth initial data at @xmath82 and becomes singular at @xmath83 for some @xmath84 ( recall that singularities at @xmath85 are impossible ) .",
    "we want to show that generically @xmath81 converges to the self - similar solution @xmath45 as @xmath29 and the rate and profile of convergence are determined by the least damped mode @xmath86 , that is @xmath87 where the coefficient @xmath88 and blowup time @xmath22 depend on the initial data . to verify , we solved eq .",
    "numerically for several large , ` randomly ' chosen , initial data leading to blowup . in order to keep track of the structure of the singularity developing on progressively smaller scales , it is necessary to use an adaptive method which refines the spatio - temporal grid near the singularity .",
    "our numerical method is based on the moving mesh method ( known as mmpde6 , see @xcite ) combined with the sundman transformation , as described in @xcite , with some minor modifications and improvements specific to the problem at hand .",
    "this method is very efficient in computations of self - similar singularities .    after obtaining a numerical solution",
    "@xmath89 we estimate the blow - up time @xmath22 and pass to the similarity variables @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 in order to compare analytical and numerical results .",
