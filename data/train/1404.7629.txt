    "many quantum - gravity theories predict scenarios in which lorentz symmetry is ( spontaneously ) broken @xcite .",
    "this breakdown of lorentz symmetry is often studied in the context of the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "the sme is an effective field theory containing all possible lorentz - violating terms that are singlets under the gauge group of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "these terms are built out of sm fields contracted with tensor coefficients that parametrize lorentz violation .",
    "many of these sme coefficients have been constrained with high precision  @xcite , but weak decays still offer interesting possibilities to obtain new bounds , or to improve existing bounds @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate lorentz violation in the charged - pion decay @xmath2 . in our analysis",
    "we consider lorentz violation in the lepton sector , the quark sector , and the @xmath0-boson propagator .",
    "we treat the quark - sector parameters in pion decay by using coordinate redefinitions , while we study the effects of the @xmath0-boson propagator in the context of a recently developed effective field theory framework  @xcite .",
    "this framework entails modifying the @xmath0-boson propagator with a general tensor @xmath3 , which can be related to a combination of gauge and higgs coefficients in the sme .",
    "this approach has been applied to nuclear @xmath4  @xcite , pion  @xcite , kaon  @xcite , and muon  @xcite decays .",
    "we derive the lorentz - violating differential decay rate , dependent on the direction of the outgoing muon and its polarization , which extends previous work  @xcite .",
    "our results lead to many possibilities to constrain lorentz - violating effects in future experiments . using existing data we obtain bounds on first - generation quark coefficients in the sme .",
    "we start from the lorentz - violating lagrangian density for second - generation leptons , which contains the dimensionless and traceless coefficient @xmath5 , @xmath6\\ , \\label{lvlagr}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the charged - lepton field , @xmath8 is the neutrino field of the corresponding flavor , and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the coefficients for the left - handed and right - handed fields are equal .",
    "gauge invariance then dictates the equality of the neutrino and charged - lepton coefficients . to calculate the pion - decay rate from eq",
    "we follow the procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the lagrangian density in eq",
    ".   contains additional , unconventional , time - derivative terms , which cause the hamiltonian to be non - hermitian in general . to remove these terms",
    ", we apply a field redefinition for both the neutrino and the charged lepton .",
    "this field redefinition is , to first order in lorentz violation , given by  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the new physical field . written in terms of @xmath11 the time - derivative term is conventional and the hamiltonian is hermitian . in terms of the redefined fields , which we will write again as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the interaction term becomes @xmath14 with    @xmath15    hence , @xmath16 , which shows that the extra time - derivative terms have been removed by the field redefinition . from eq .",
    "we see that the vertex is now proportional to @xmath17 , while it was proportional to @xmath18 before the redefinition .    from the dirac equation",
    ", the dispersion relation and the spinor solutions can be obtained .",
    "when @xmath5 is the only nonzero lorentz - violating coefficient , the dispersion relation can be written as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the energy of both the particle and the antiparticle of either spin state is , to first order in lorentz violation , given by @xmath22 , where we introduced the convenient notation @xmath23 with @xmath24 . from the dirac equation",
    "we determine that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 the muon spin in its restframe , and the spinors normalized to unity @xcite .",
    "this results from explicit calculation or can be understood because @xmath29 , which is just the normal dirac equation with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we can now determine the squared matrix element for pion decay .",
    "after summing over neutrino spin and using momentum conservation , it is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the muon and neutrino momentum , respectively , @xmath35 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath36 mev is the pion decay constant , and the upper ( lower ) sign applies for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) decay .",
    "the matrix element is proportional to the muon mass .",
    "this can be understood by the usual spin - balance argument for pion decay , which shows that , in the pion restframe , the outgoing leptons should have the same helicity , while the weak interaction only couples to the chiral component of the charged - lepton field that is of the opposite handedness .",
    "interestingly , the lorentz - violating spinors are eigenvectors of the operator @xmath39 instead of the usual helicity operator . also , in the pion restframe , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "this shows that the muons are polarized in the @xmath42-direction , instead of in the normal @xmath43-direction .",
    "this influences experiments that depend on pion decay for their polarized muons , such as @xmath44 @xcite or twist @xcite .",
    "the first could detect the discussed effect , for example in the phase of the muon polarization , varying over the course of a sidereal day .",
    "based on the current precision of the experiment a statistical precision of @xmath45 seems attainable .",
    "the differential decay rate is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pion momentum . by using the dispersion relations and momentum conservation repeatedly",
    ", we find for the differential pion decay rate in the pion restframe @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and latin indices run over space indices only .",
    "we see that indeed the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) decay rate vanishes if the muon spin is antiparallel ( parallel ) to @xmath52",
    ". we can write eq .",
    "more explicitly as @xmath53\\ , \\label{cdecay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are equal to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with the replacement @xmath58 .",
    "there are no terms proportional to @xmath59 or @xmath60 in eq .  .",
    "this implies that there will be no difference in rate for muons going in opposite directions , when the polarization of the muons is not detected .",
    "notice also that the decay rate , integrated over muon direction , does not depend on the muon spin , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 .",
    "we expect this to be no longer the case when the coefficients for left - handed and right - handed fields are taken to be different .",
    "the energies of the two spin states are then no longer degenerate , and the form of the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 is considerably more involved  @xcite .",
    "lorentz violation in pion decay can also result from the modified @xmath0-boson propagator @xmath64 where @xmath3 parametrizes a broad class of lorentz - violating effects in the sme  @xcite .",

    "respectively . for @xmath5",
    "there are no terms proportional to @xmath59 , while for @xmath3 there are no terms proportional to @xmath74 . in the former case",
    "there will be a nonzero dipole asymmetry in the muon direction , while one has to search for a higher - order multipole asymmetry in the latter case .",
    "another difference between @xmath5 and @xmath3 is the enhancement factor @xmath75 for the spin - dependent terms in eq .  , which is not present in eq .",
    "for the dominant branching fraction @xmath2 this is of order unity .",
    "however , if one would measure the electron spin in @xmath76 decay , this gives a sizable enhancement .",
    "we point out that @xmath3 , in contrast with @xmath5 , produces a nonzero asymmetry in the spin of the muon : @xmath77 where we chose the quantization axis in the @xmath78-direction .",
    "finally , we notice that the decay rate in eq .   has its maximum if @xmath79 . to first order in lorentz violation eq .",
    "is proportional to @xmath80 , with @xmath81 given by @xmath82/m$ ] .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath3 thus influence the polarization of the outgoing muons .",
    "it is known @xcite , that some ( combinations of ) sme coefficients are physically unobservable . at the level of the lagrangian ,",
    "this can be shown by using field or coordinate redefinitions to bring the lagrangian with the apparent lorentz violation to a conventional lorentz - symmetric form . since the physics does not depend on a choice of coordinates or fields , the coefficients that can be removed are unobservable in experiments . in many cases interactions between different sectors of the sme",
    "prevent the full removal of the lorentz - violating coefficients .    as an example of this",
    ", we look at a @xmath5 parameter for a fermion field of a particular species , such as in eq .  .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , a lagrangian with a nonzero @xmath5 parameter is equivalent to a conventional lagrangian in a skewed coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath5 can be removed by a coordinate transformation @xmath83 .",
    "however , this transformation introduces @xmath84 in the other fermion sectors , while for the gauge field sector @xmath85 .",
    "the latter has the same form as a partly nonzero @xmath86 parameter in the gauge field sector .",
    "if we only consider @xmath5 coefficients for fermions and the relevant parts of the @xmath86 coefficients for gauge fields , we can always make one sector of the sme conventional by means of a coordinate transformation .",
    "notice that this is not a general coordinate transformation , in the usual sense .",
    "this is because we do not transform the metric , but reinterpret the coordinates with respect to the metric .",
    "this means that we make a choice which sector of the lagrangian defines the clocks and measuring rods , and is therefore the conventional sector .",
    "the choice as to which sector is conventional , depends on the experimental setup .",
    "we now turn to the quark sector of the sme .",
    "although there are strict bounds for effective parameters from meson oscillations and measurements on the neutron and the proton @xcite , the best bounds on actual quark parameters are in the top quark sector and they are at the @xmath87-@xmath88 level @xcite .",
    "bounds on parameters for the other generations are lacking . using coordinate transformations",

    "the corresponding lorentz - violating part of the sme lagrangian is @xmath93\\ , \\label{lvquark}\\ ] ] where we assume that lorentz violation is equal for left - handed and right - handed quarks and that @xmath94 is diagonal in flavor space .",
    "gauge invariance then forces the parameters to be equal for up and down quarks .    as mentioned in the previous section",
    ", a coordinate transformation @xmath95 brings the quark lagrangian to its conventional , lorentz - symmetric , form . the coordinate transformation results in a low - energy @xmath0-boson propagator of the form in eq .   with @xmath96 and a @xmath84 coefficient for the second generation leptons .",
    "the effect of the coordinate transformations is visualized in the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ redef ] .",
    "notice that the transformation also changes the other sectors of the sme .",
    "it depends on the experimental conditions if this is relevant . in practice observables",
    "always depend on differences between lorentz - violating parameters of the involved particles .",
    "pion decay thus actually depends on differences between quark , lepton , and @xmath0-boson parameters .",
    "we will focus on the quark parameters the remainder of this paper .",
    "the calculation of the decay rate in terms of quark parameters can now be split in two parts , one dealing with lorentz violation in the lepton kinetic terms and interaction vertex and one dealing with the lorentz violation in the @xmath0-boson propagator .",
    "the former part of the calculation exactly parallels the calculation above , with the substitution @xmath97 .",
    "the latter part , with a modified @xmath0-boson propagator , is treated by putting @xmath96 .",
    "since we treat lorentz violation to first order , we can simply combine the results in eqs .   and , resulting in @xmath98\\mp \\frac{4m_\\pi}{m}c^{0j}\\hat{s}_j \\pm c^{ij}\\hat{s}_i\\hat{p}_j\\bigg]\\notag\\ . \\\\ \\label{decayrquarkp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
