    "the model of bimodal accretion disk , which consists of a geometrically thin , optically thick shakura - sunyaev disk ( ssd ) ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) as the outer part and a quasi - spherical , optically thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) as the inner part , has been quite successfully applied to black hole x - ray binaries and galactic nuclei ( see narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 for a review ) . in this model , the accretion flow switches from an ssd to an adaf at a transition radius @xmath1 .",
    "however , @xmath1 was infered only by making plausible assumptions on how it depends on the accretion rate @xmath2 .",
    "the precise mechanism through which the ssd material is converted into an adaf remains a matter of debate , and no self - consistent global solution for such a transition has been found so far . indeed , narayan , kato , & honma ( 1997 ) obtained a number of examples of global transonic adaf solutions which connect outward to geometrically thin disks .",
    "lu , gu , & yuan ( 1999 ) recovered the whole class of such global adaf - thin disk solutions . but these authors did not take the local radiative cooling into account , thus their solutions could not show the variation of the optical depth and could not be regarded as bimodal ssd - adaf solutions . on the other hand , chen , abramowicz , & lasota ( 1997 ) considered the local radiative cooling as provided by thermal bremsstrahlung , but",
    "did not find ssd - adaf solutions .",
    "igumenshchev , abramowicz , & novikov ( 1998 ) also adopted bremsstrahlung cooling and found that only an outer shapiro - lightman - eardley ( sle ) disk ( shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) could smoothly match an inner adaf .",
    "such sle - adaf solutions are optically thin everywhere .",
    "more impressive in this respect is the result of dullemond & turolla ( 1998 , hereafter dt98 ) .",
    "they concluded that the ssd - adaf transition was not permitted , and only an outer sle disk could match an inner adaf or ssd .",
    "but , as they noticed , because of the thermal instability of the sle disk , such sle - adaf or sle - ssd models most probably do not exist in nature .",
    "it would be a pity if such a promising bimodal ssd - adaf model could not be actually constructed . in this _",
    "letter _ we also use an argument based on energetic considerations which is similar to dt98 , but find that the ssd - adaf transition is possible for large values of viscosity parameter .",
    "we confirm our qualitative prediction by presenting a numerical example of the global ssd - adaf bimodal solution .",
    "the system of equations adopted here , which is similar to dt98 , makes the following standard assumptions : + ( 1 ) : the vertical half - thickness of the disk is expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the isothermal sound speed , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the total pressure and the mass density at the equatorial plane , respectively , and @xmath7 is the keplerian angular velocity calculated by using the newtonian potential , @xmath8 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) : the kinematic viscosity coefficient is expressed as @xmath9 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) : @xmath5 is the sum of gas and radiation pressure , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ion temperature and the electron temperature , respectively , and @xmath14min@xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radiative cooling rate and @xmath18 is the total optical depth .",
    "+ ( 4):the opacity @xmath19 is the sum of electron scattering and absorption opacity , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    introducing the radial velocity @xmath23 , the angular velocity @xmath24 , and the surface density @xmath25 , the continuity , radial momentum , azimuthal momentum , and energy equations take the form ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ; dt98 ) @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 the viscous heating @xmath30 has the usual expression @xmath31 the advective cooling is expressed as @xmath32 the radiative cooling rate @xmath17 is calculated using a bridging formula ( dt98 ) , @xmath33 eq.(7 ) is valid in both optically thin and optically thick regimes .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cooling is given by ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) @xmath34    abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter chen95 ) obtained a unified @xmath35 picture of accretion flows around black holes with an additional assumption that the disk always rotates at @xmath36 .",
    "however , it is known that slim disks ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ) and adafs are quite sub - keplerianly rotating .",
    "we therefore assume : @xmath37 , where the parameter @xmath38 is obtained from the self - similar solution ( narayan & yi , 1994 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath39 and adopt the self - similar method , then the equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are reduced to the following algebraic form : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43    from eq.(9 ) one easily obtains : @xmath44 .",
    "we use a parameter @xmath45 to measure the degree to which the flow is advective .",
    "if the radial velocity is neglected , eq.(9 ) is simplified to : @xmath46 . for radiative cooling - dominated flows ( @xmath47 ) such as ssds or sle disks , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ; while for advection - dominated flows ( @xmath50 ) such as slim disks or adafs , @xmath51 , and @xmath52",
    ". thus the assumption @xmath53 is more reasonable as it is valid for both radiative cooling - dominated and advection - dominated accretion flows .",
    "abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) first obtained a unified @xmath35 picture for accretion flows at a fixed radius @xmath54 in the case of low viscosity , which includes four classes of solutions , namely ssds , sle disks , slim disks and adafs .",
    "chen95 found that two types of @xmath55 picture should exist , which are separated by a critical viscosity parameter @xmath56 .",
    "we recover here these two types of @xmath57 picture with our assumption @xmath58 , which are given in fig.1 , ( a ) for @xmath59 and ( b ) for @xmath60 .",
    "the solid lines in the figures represent thermal equilibrium solutions , i.e. with @xmath61 . in fig.1(a ) , the right @xmath62-shaped curve consists of three branches , of which the lower one is for gas - pressure - supported ssds , the middle one for radiation - pressure - supported ssds , and the upper one for slim disks ; while the left curve consists of two branches , of which the lower one is for sle disks , and the upper one for adafs . in fig.1(b ) , the straight line is for adafs and slim disks , while the @xmath63-shaped curve consists of three branches , of which the two branches on the right are the same as the middle and lower branches of the @xmath62-shaped curve in fig.1(a ) , and the branch on the left is for sle disks .",
    "the unstable branches are those which have @xmath64 above and @xmath65 below , while the stable branches are just opposite .",
    "thus gas - pressure - supported ssds , slim disks and adafs are thermally stable , whereas radiation - pressure - supported ssds and sle disks are thermally unstable .",
    "dt98 investigated the thermal instability in fig.1(a ) , and argued that the ssd - adaf transition is not permitted .",
    "we agree with dt98 that such a transition is indeed prohibited in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the arrows in fig.1(a ) show a limit - cycle behavior resulting from the thermal instability of a radiation - pressure - supported ssd .",
    "however , the other type of picture as shown in fig.1(b ) was ignored by dt98 .",
    "because a bridging formula like eq.(7 ) is used , the optically thick , high @xmath2 slim disk solution and the optically thin , low @xmath2 adaf solution can be described by a single line in fig.1(b ) , the line extends over the entire range of @xmath2 without break .",
    "it is this feature that makes the ssd - adaf transition possible .",
    "a thermal disturbance on a radiation - pressure - supported ssd can trigger the flow to behavior in the following way : the flow first jumps to a slim disk solution and becomes thermally stable .",
    "but because the accretion rate @xmath2 does not match that of the outer ssd , then the slim disk must evolve into an adaf , for which @xmath2 matches that of the outer ssd .",
    "the whole process is indicated by the two arrows in fig.1(b ) .",
    "an ssd - adaf transition is realized .    to confirm this qualitative prediction",
    ", we now go on to present our numerical models for bimodal ssd - adaf disks .",
    "the general thermal instability condition is @xmath66 we denote @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in privious",
    "researches on ssds the disk was usually divided into three separate regions , for which ( from the inner to the outer ) the two parameters @xmath69 are ( 0,0 ) , ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) , respectively .",
    "here we let both @xmath70 and @xmath71 vary continuously from 0 to 1 , thus the ssd solution obtained will smoothly extend over these three regions . in our formulation eq.(13 ) takes an explicit form @xmath72 when the opacity is dominated by the electron scattering , i.e. @xmath73 , this condition is reduced to the usual expression : @xmath74 .    once the viscosity parameter @xmath75 and the relative accretion rate @xmath76 ( @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the eddington accretion rate ) are given , we can search for the global ssd - adaf solution by the following steps : +",
    "( i ) provided that the given viscosity parameter @xmath0 , a critical radius @xmath79 exists .",
    "the @xmath35 picture is of the type of fig.1(a ) for @xmath80 , and of the type of fig.1(b ) for @xmath81 .",
    "we first calculate the value of @xmath79 which corresponds to the given @xmath82 .",
    "+ ( ii ) we solve the equations of ssd inward from an outer boundary @xmath83 .",
    "the ssd solution breaks off when the thermal instability condition eq.(14 ) is met at a certain radius @xmath84 .",
    "we calculate the value of @xmath84 which corresponds to the given @xmath82 and @xmath76 .",
    "if the condition eq.(14 ) is never met for the given @xmath85 and @xmath76 , then the ssd solution is thermally stable everywhere .",
    "+ ( iii ) if @xmath86 , the ssd - adaf transition will occur at @xmath87 .",
    "we can obtain the self - similar adaf solution inside @xmath1 . combining with the ssd solution outside @xmath1",
    ", we obtain the whole global ssd - adaf solution . on the contrary , if @xmath88 , the limit - cycle behavior will occur at @xmath84 , and the ssd - adaf transition will not occur .    in fig.2",
    "we show how the behavior of an original ssd flow depends on @xmath82 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is seen that three possible cases , namely the stable ssd , the limit cycle behavior , and the ssd - adaf transition , each occupy a certain region of the @xmath89 parameter space , and the ssd - adaf transition occurs for @xmath0 and a definite range of @xmath90 .",
    "to construct numerically a global bimodal ssd - adaf solution , we choose @xmath91 .",
    "we then obtain the corresponding critical radius @xmath92 , and find from fig.2 that the ssd - adaf transition occurs for @xmath93 .",
    "the ssd is stable everywhere for @xmath94 , and the limit - cycle behavior appears for @xmath95 .",
    "an example of the global ssd - adaf solution for @xmath96 is presented in fig.3 .",
    "the ssd becomes unstable at @xmath97 .",
    "the figure gives a @xmath98 picture at @xmath99 , which belongs to the type of fig.1(b ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the transition from the ssd solution ( filled circle ) to an adaf solution ( filled square ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ we show that the thermal instability of a radiation - pressure - supported ssd can possibly trigger two different kinds of behavior of the flow , namely the limit - cycle and the ssd - adaf transition . for low values of viscosity parameter @xmath100 , only the limit - cycle behavior can occur ; while for large values @xmath0 , either of the two kinds of behavior can , and which one is actually realized is determined by @xmath76 .",
    "we use two parameter , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , to smoothly connect the three usually separated regions of an ssd , so that the exact position of the ssd - adaf transition can be found , and the global bimodal ssd - adaf solution can be obtained .",
    "the range of @xmath82 values necessary for the ssd - adaf transition to occur should depend on , among other things , radiative cooling mechanisms adopted .",
    "chen95 used two bridging formulae of @xmath17 to calculate @xmath56 for a fixed radius @xmath54 , one of which is introduced by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , who considered bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling , and comptonization ; and the other of which is introduced by wandel & liang ( 1991 ) , who considered bremsstrahlung cooling with comptonization only .",
    "they found that the value of @xmath56 calculated with the former formula ( i.e. with more sources of radiative cooling ) is higher than that calculated with the latter one .",
    "for example , for @xmath101 , they had @xmath102 with the former formula , and @xmath103 with the latter one . since in bridging formula eq.(7 ) only bremsstrahlung cooling is taken into account , we guess that if other sources of radiative cooling such as synchrotron emission and comptonization are included , the lowest required value of @xmath82 for the ssd - adaf transition would become larger than 0.5 , i.e. the necessary condition on @xmath82 for the existence of bimodal ssd - adaf disk would seem even more restrictive .",
    "it is unclear yet if there are other factors which could help to relax this condition on @xmath82 .",
    "however , the good thing for the ssd - adaf transition is that the larger the allowed value of @xmath82 is , the wider the corresponding range of @xmath76 is , as seen clearly from fig.2 .",
    "the ssd - adaf transition found in this _",
    "results from the instability of the radiation - pressure - supported region , i.e. the inner part of ssd .",
    "thus the transition position is close to the central black hole , as we have calculated here . on the other hand , observations of some black hole x - ray binaries ( narayan et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) seem to imply a ssd - adaf transition radius @xmath104 , which is definitely in the very outer region of ssd . however , it is well known that the outer region of ssd is gas - pressure - supported and is both thermally and viscously stable . in our opinion , it is difficult to see from the theoretical point of view how to convert a gas - pressure - supported ssd directly into an adaf .",
    "the apparent conflict between present observations and theories remains an unsolved issue ."
