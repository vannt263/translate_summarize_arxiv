    "<S> this review presents the elastic theory of low - dimensional ( one- and two - dimensional ) continua and its applications in bio- and nano - structures .    first , the curve and surface theory , as the geometric representation of the low - dimensional continua , is briefly described through cartan moving frame method . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic theory of kirchhoff rod , helfrich rod , bending - soften rod , fluid membrane , and solid shell is revisited . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy density of the continua , is constructed on the basis of the symmetry argument . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental equations can be derived from two kinds of viewpoints : the bottom - up and the top - down standpoints . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , the force and moment balance equations are obtained from newton s laws and then some constitute relations are complemented in terms of the free energy density . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental equations are derived directly from the variation of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> although the fundamental equations have different forms obtained from these two viewpoints , several examples reveal that they are , in fact , equivalent to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the application and availability of the elastic theory of low - dimensional continua in bio - structures , including short dna rings , lipid membranes , and cell membranes , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the kink stability of short dna rings is addressed by using the theory of kirchhoff rod , helfrich rod , and bending - soften rod . </S>",
    "<S> the lipid membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane . the shape equation and the stability of closed lipid vesicles , the shape equation and </S>",
    "<S> boundary conditions of open lipid vesicles with free edges as well as vesicles with lipid domains , and the adhesions between a vesicle and a substrate or another vesicle are fully investigated . </S>",
    "<S> a cell membrane is simplified as a composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton , which is a little similar to the solid shell . </S>",
    "<S> the equations to describe the in - plane strains and shapes of cell membranes are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the membrane skeleton enhances highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes .    </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the application and availability of the elastic theory of low - dimensional continua in nano - structures , including graphene and carbon nanotubes , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a revised lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures and strains is the same as the free energy of 2d solid shells . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic roughening of graphene and several typical mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based on this continuum form . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to avoid introducing the controversial concepts , the young s modulus and thickness of graphene and single - walled carbon nanotubes , with this continuum form . </S>"
