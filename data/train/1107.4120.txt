    "in his 2009 paper  @xcite , cameron introduced a new class of combinatorial designs , which simultaneously generalizes various well - known classes of designs , including @xmath0-designs , mutually orthogonal latin squares , orthogonal arrays and 1-factorizations of complete graphs .",

    ", cameron suggests that a similar definition can be made for generalizing both packing and covering designs .    in a recent paper  @xcite , the authors , cavers and meagher considered the analogue of cameron s generalization for covering designs . in this paper , we pursue the `` dual '' notion of _ generalized packing designs_. the key difference when studying packing or covering problems rather than `` traditional '' designs is that the question is typically not whether the designs exist ( this is usually trivial to answer ) , but obtaining bounds on the maximum ( for packings ) or minimum ( for coverings ) size , and constructing optimal ( or near - optimal ) designs .",
    "however , the similarity between packing and covering only goes so far . in this paper",
    ", we shall see how a number of families of known designs ( including howell designs , partial latin squares and several classes of triple systems ) arise as special cases of generalized packing designs .",
    "we shall also see how concepts such as resolvability and block colouring of ordinary designs and packings , and orthogonal resolutions and colourings , appear in this setting .",
