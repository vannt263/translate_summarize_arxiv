    "the competition between crystallization and glass - formation is of longstanding scientific interest.@xcite it naturally depends in detail on local fluctuations away from equilibrium liquid structure .",
    "since these fluctuations are both small ( in lengthscale ) and short - lived except at temperatures very near solidification , they are difficult to characterize in experiments . moreover , unlike crystal nucleation , vitrification has historically been difficult to associate with local structural change .",
    "however , recent computer simulations that have focused on understanding solidification at a microscopic level@xcite have led to much progress in our understanding of the crystallization - glass formation ( cf - gf ) competition .",
    "these studies have identified key structural features within liquids , at the level of _ clusters _ of @xmath0 particles , that dramatically influence solidification .",
    "differently structured clusters have different thermodynamic stabilities , and thus both their formation propensities and characteristic lifetimes vary differently with temperature .",
    "recent analyses of such differences have identified long - lived , stable amorphous clusters that strongly promote glass - formation ; clusters that are fivefold symmetric@xcite and/or are subsets of icosahedra@xcite are particularly effective glass - promoters .",
    "other work@xcite has found that clusters possessing bond - orientational order compatible with the stable crystal can be present and long - lived above the solidification temperature , and that these dynamically slow regions of `` medium range crystalline order '' ( mrco@xcite ) promote crystallization .    to date , most analyses of this type have been carried out only for relatively simple models of atomic or colloidal systems , e.g.  the wahnstrm@xcite and kob - andersen@xcite binary lennard - jones mixtures . in particular",
    ", they have not been extended to polymers.@xcite polymers exhibit a particularly complicated solidification behavior that is strongly thermal - history - dependent@xcite and also depends in considerable detail on their rich liquid - state _",
    "dynamics_. for example , the locally nematic alignment of chain molecules which typically precedes crystallization is rate - limited by the slow dynamics of entangled melts.@xcite .",
    "if this alignment can not occur because the cooling rate is too high , the system will glass - form . both the alignment propensity and single - chain dynamics in turn depend strongly on the stiffness of the polymer chains.@xcite understanding the cf - gf competition",
    "therefore requires understanding both the structure and dynamics of the parent liquid .",
    "the goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of how the microstructure and dynamics of polymer melts depend on temperature and chain stiffness , using molecular simulations and with an eye towards improving our understanding of the solidification process . for simplicity",
    ", we employ a recently developed coarse - grained model that has been used to study the cf - gf competition,@xcite and unentangled chains . by tuning a single model parameter ( the chain stiffness @xmath1 )",
    ", we show that marked differences in solidification behavior coincide with marked differences in melt dynamics .",
    "flexible chains that form random - walk - close - packed ( rwcp ) crystals upon solidification,@xcite wherein monomers are close - packed but chains adopt random - walk - like configurations , exhibit a simple melt dynamics that remains `` fast '' down to solidification .",
    "stiff chains that form nematic melts and solidify into nematic close - packed ( ncp ) crystals,@xcite wherein monomers are close - packed while chains adopt rod - like configurations and are aligned nematically , also exhibit such `` simple , fast '' melt dynamics . in sharp contrast , for an intermediate chain stiffness that produces glass - formation upon cooling,@xcite systems exhibit the dynamics of fragile glass - formers , including vogel - fulcher dynamical arrest , even though their ground state is ncp .",
    "we attempt to connect these differences to static structure using various tools recently developed in studies of colloidal glass- and crystal - formers , that have , however , not yet been applied to polymeric systems .",
    "in contrast to data for some colloidal systems,@xcite cluster - level measures of static and dynamic structure do not exhibit a clear signature differentiating our crystallizing and glassforming polymer melts .",
    "instead , we find that the cause of the dynamical slowdown producing glass - formation in intermediate - stiffness systems is that the stringlike cooperative motion@xcite associated with dynamical heterogeneity becomes coordinated along chain backbones in a fashion not found for either flexible or stiff chains .",
    "our study employs the soft - pearl - necklace polymer model used in refs .",

    "this is expected ; what is surprising is that intermediate - stiffness chains behave so differently . for @xmath23 systems , all @xmath76 continue increasing steadily as @xmath32",
    "is decreased past @xmath101 , with no significant change in their slopes .",
    "this is so despite the fact that @xmath23 systems , like their counterparts for all @xmath31 , possess a crystalline ( ncp ) ground state .",
    "perhaps more surprisingly , it is so despite the fact that flexible and intermediate - stiffness systems are similarly structured at the level of single clusters , i.e.  their values of @xmath76 and ratios @xmath75 are similar at @xmath32 slightly above @xmath101 .",
    "panel ( d ) of figure [ fig : tccpops ] shows that stiff - chain melts possess rather different cluster - level structure than their flexible - chain counterparts .",
    "the nematic ordering of the melts suppresses fivefold - symmetric order ; instead , hexagonal - like order exists in the planes perpendicular to the nematic director field",
    ". this may be part of the reason why these systems are good crystal - formers . nonetheless , the main conclusion from this panel is that differences in cluster - level structure between stiff and more - flexible melts are greater than the corresponding differences between intermediate - stiffness and flexible melts ( panels ( b - c ) ) .",
    "thus it is difficult to attribute the dynamical arrest to differences in the cluster population fractions @xmath76 or their ratios .    for all @xmath1 for temperatures above solidification , there are large populations of mutually incommensurable clusters ( e.g.  @xmath78 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "this suggests a large kinetic bottleneck for crystallization ; the incommensurability must be alleviated for the melts to crystallize . for flexible and stiff chains",
    "it is alleviated during solidification ( i.e. @xmath160 drops sharply at @xmath101 ) , while for intermediate - stiffness chains this does not happen .",
    "in other words , significant packing frustration exists in the melt state for all @xmath1 , and is alleviated upon solidification for flexible and stiff chains but not for intermediate - stiffness chains .",
    "the question again raised is : why is this so ?",
    "@xcite showed that the dynamical slowdown in model colloidal glass - formers is associated with percolation of the amorphous clusters ; mean lifetimes of these clusters increase sharply with decreasing @xmath32 as their populations increase .",
    "one might expect this to also be true in our systems , but it does not seem to be ; examination of snapshots of various amorphous - ordered clusters shows no obvious difference in amorphous - cluster percolation levels between flexible and intermediate - stiffness systems at similar values of @xmath121.@xcite    another potential answer is that the abovementioned dynamical heterogeneity is closely associated with this heterogeneous cluster structure .",
    "transient structural ordering has been extensively linked to dynamical heterogeneity in recent years.@xcite recent simulation studies have found that regions of locally icosohedral@xcite ( and in other systems , crystalline@xcite ) order are dynamically slower than their more ordered ( more amorphous ) counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig : clustlife ] indicates the lifetimes @xmath93 for the four clusters of primary interest , calculated by identifying @xmath94 in eq .",
    "[ eq : aoft].@xcite the 8-particle clusters naturally have shorter lifetimes than their 6-particle counterparts because for our definition of @xmath92 ( eq .  [ eq : aoft ] ) there are more ways for larger-@xmath72 clusters to decay , i.e.  by any of the @xmath72 particles in the cluster hopping away .",
    "data for stiff chains are not shown because the values of @xmath93 are very small ( @xmath161 ) and their trend with @xmath32 is not clear at the high temperatures considered .    for flexible and intermediate - stiffness chains , comparing data for @xmath162 to data for @xmath163 and data for @xmath164 to data for @xmath165",
    "provides a partial explanation of the heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "clusters with fivefold or partial - icosohedral order are more stable in the liquid state and have larger lifetimes , as expected .",
    "the associated slower structural of relaxation of regions with more liquidlike ordering helps explain the stretched - exponential relaxation observed for @xmath64 .",
    "values of @xmath163 are comparable to values of @xmath70 and exhibit vogel - fulcher - like temperature dependence for @xmath23 chains , whereas for flexible chains they show a more arrhenius @xmath32-dependence .    the larger lifetimes of clusters that are subsets of icosohedra ( i.e.  @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) are consistent with previous results@xcite indicating such clusters play a key role in glass - formation for some systems .",
    "however , @xmath166 also holds for flexible - chain systems that possess `` fast , simple '' dynamics .",

    "alternatively , one might imagine that nematic order in the intermediate - stiffness system is more heterogeneous , and that the presence of regions of higher and lower @xmath54 produces frustration leading to the dynamical slowdown .",

    "many studies@xcite have shown that the sets of particles which are most mobile over timescales corresponding to maximally heterogeneous dynamics form noncompact , `` stringlike '' structures .",
    "roughly speaking , the strings are formed when one particle undergoes a hop - like displacement , another particle hops into the space it leaves behind , and so on .",
    "these studies have shown that the length of the strings increases as @xmath185 is approached from above , and it is now generally agreed upon@xcite that the strings and stringlike motion are examples of the `` cooperatively rearranging regions '' of adam and gibbs,@xcite and thus play a key role in controlling the glass transition .",
    "we now examine how chain stiffness affects potentially stringlike motion in our systems .",
    "we follow the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite to identify `` highly mobile '' particles as the @xmath186 of particles undergoing the largest displacements over a time interval @xmath187 . in other words ,",
    "highly mobile particles are those which move the furthest over the time interval over which dynamics are maximally heterogeneous .",
    "figure [ fig : strings ] shows snapshots of these particles for temperatures just above solidification : @xmath188 for @xmath22 ( panel a ) and @xmath180 for @xmath23 ( panel b ) .",
    "the correlations of mobile particles are much more obviously stringlike for the glassforming , intermediate - stiffness system .",
    "different colors in figure [ fig : strings](a - b ) indicate monomers belonging to different chains .",
    "one can clearly see that the mobile - particle sets ( hereafter referred to as strings ) for intermediate - stiffness systems correspond much better to chain backbones than the strings for flexible - chain systems ; nearby mobile particles for the latter are far more likely to be spread amongst multiple chains .",
    "in other words , for intermediate - stiffness chains ( but much less so for flexible and stiff chains ) the strings often correspond to large sections of chains executing coordinated motion along their backbones .",
    "panel ( c ) illustrates this quantitatively by plotting @xmath189 , the probability that monomers a chemical distance @xmath190 away from a mobile monomer on the same chain are also mobile at temperature @xmath32",
    ". random mobility of monomers along chains would produce @xmath191 .",
    "actual mobility correlations are short - ranged for flexible and stiff chains , but long - ranged for intermediate - stiffness chains",
    ". the correlations of particle mobility along chains also increase with decreasing @xmath32 , and do so more strongly for @xmath23 chains .",
    "we believe that this effect is the source of dynamical arrest in the intermediate - stiffness systems .",
    "monomer hops can more easily occur in directions perpendicular to the chain backbone for flexible chains than for intermediate - stiffness chains , because the angular energy term @xmath192 ( eq .  [ eq : ubend ] ) imposes an energy cost for such hops . on the other hand , few excursions away from @xmath193 occur for stiff - chain systems , and mobility distributions are narrower since these chains undergo quasi - rigid - rod - like motion .",
    "the net effect is that monomer hops for intermediate - stiffness chains ( but _ not _ flexible or stiff chains ) are apparently an activated process that induces cooperative motion ; when one monomer hops , it pulls its ( chemically ) nearby intrachain neighbors along with it .",
    "this motion resembles `` crawling . ''",
    "the vogel - fulcher relaxation observed for these systems could potentially arise from an increase in the activation energy for hops as @xmath52 increases , together with the increase in hop correlation along chain backbones .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the coupled chain - stiffness and temperature dependence of both dynamics and microstructure in model crystallizable bead - spring polymer melts .",
    "we found nonmonotonic dependence of dynamics upon chain stiffness ; both flexible and stiff chains possess `` fast , simple '' ( arrhenius ) dynamics , whereas intermediate - stiffness chains exhibit the dynamics of fragile glass - formers .",
    "this result complements previous simulation studies ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) that examined the dependence of melt dynamics on chain stiffness . for example ,",
    "@xcite found that fragility ( i.e. dynamical slowdown ) increases with chain stiffness , while here we showed that this effect is nonmonotonic and reverses when melts become nematically ordered .",
    "our attempts to isolate a microscopic static - structural cause of the different dynamics yielded no clear `` smoking gun . '' indeed , predicting whether a system will be a glassformer in terms of its interactions and microstructure is well - known as an extremely difficult problem.@xcite however , the different gross dynamics _ are _ clearly linked to qualitatively different heterogenous monomer - scale dynamics . for intermediate - stiffness chains",
    ", stringlike motion@xcite corresponds to activated `` crawling '' along chain backbones .",
    "such crawling is far less prominent for both flexible and stiff chains .",
    "previous studies@xcite that found mobile - particle strings to be largely uncorrelated with chain backbones employed fully flexible chains ; our result suggests an additional mechanism of activated / cooperative rearrangement for intermediate - stiffness chains .",
    "many interesting simulation studies of polymer crystallization have appeared recently.@xcite nearly all of these have employed atomistic or united - atom models to study specific polymer chemistries .",
    "such studies certainly can identify phenomena which are general to many different polymers , but their use of single interaction potentials rather than comparing behavior for a range of potentials often obscures this generality .",
    "furthermore , few of these studies have connected solidification behavior directly to temperature - dependent steady - state melt dynamics , and none have connected it to the chain stiffness dependence of these dynamics .",
    "here we have done so for unentangled chains .",
    "extension of this work to entangled systems would be very challenging since the stiffness dependence of the disentanglement dynamics@xcite will couple to the cf - vs .- gf - related dynamics described above , but would be a worthy goal .    experimentally observing local microstructural motifs comparable to the clusters discussed herein",
    "may not be possible for typical polymers , due to the small length scales and short time scales involved .",
    "however , such motifs have been observed in colloidal systems@xcite using confocal microscopy , and recent studies have also examined their relaxation dynamics.@xcite variable - stiffness colloidal and granular polymers@xcite have recently been synthesized , and it would be interesting to study the cf - gf competition in these systems ."
