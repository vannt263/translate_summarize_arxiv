    "mapping the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization is one of the major challenges of future missions of observational cosmology .",
    "cmb polarization is linear and therefore can be described by the first three stokes parameters i , q and u which are generally combined to produce three fields ( modes ) , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . the polarization of the cmb photons carries extra physical informations that are not accessible by the study of the temperature anisotropies .",
    "therefore its measurement helps breaking down the degeneracies on cosmological parameters as encounter with temperature anisotropies measurements only @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the study of the cmb polarization is also a fundamental tool to estimate the energy scale of inflation which has been proposed to solve the problems of flatness , of isotropy and of the seed perturbations for the formation of the structures in the universe .",
    "inflationary models predict the presence of tensor perturbations of the metric which will lead to an unique signature in the cmb polarization @xmath2 modes .",
    "the detection of the latter would be a strong proof of such an epoch and also a way to constrain the energy scale at which inflation occurs by measuring the tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath9 @xcite .    since the beginning of the cmb anisotropies observations with the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) @xcite",
    ", a great amount of experiments have been designed to determine the cmb temperature angular power spectrum @xcite . by contrast , the polarization anisotropies , which are between 2 and 5 orders of magnitude weaker than temperature ones are not accurately measured yet .",
    "a first detection of the cmb @xmath1 modes has been performed by dasi @xcite , capmap @xcite , cbi @xcite and more recently by boomerang @xcite and wmap @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 temperature - polarization cross correlation has been measured by wmap @xcite and boomerang @xcite .",
    "no detection of the cmb @xmath2 modes has been reported yet .",
    "nevertheless , constraints on the tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath9 , have been set by the wmap team .",
    "they set an upper limit of @xmath10 ( 95% cl ) @xcite for the temperature and polarization analysis and of @xmath11 ( 95@xmath12 cl ) @xcite for a polarization - only analysis .",
    "the detection of such low signals is possible by improving the instrumental sensitivity , but this is not the only issue in the determination of the cmb polarization power spectra .",
    "other astrophysical emissions as for example the diffuse galactic emission including free - free , dust and synchrotron and the extragalactic - sources emissions also contribute to the sky brightness at the frequencies of interest for cmb studies , and therefore must be efficiently subtracted .",
    "these _ foregrounds _ are particularly important for the study of the cmb polarization . excluding the free - free emission which is not polarized , the other contributions are expected to be significantly polarized with similar power on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes .",
    "recent measurements of the galactic synchrotron polarization emission at 1.41  ghz @xcite and at 23 ghz by wmap @xcite show this emission is significantly polarized at large angular scales .",
    "further , archeops measurements at 353  ghz show that the galactic dust diffuse emission is polarized up to a level of 5 to 10 % both in the galactic center @xcite and at high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "finally , for the polarization of extragalactic point sources the sparsity of the data available makes reliable predictions difficult @xcite .",
    "a direct subtraction of these foreground contributions on the cmb data will require an accurate knowledge of their spatial distributions and of the electromagnetic spectra of their anisotropies .",
    "for the synchrotron emission a full sky map at 408 mhz in temperature is available @xcite and more recently the wmap team provided a map at 30  ghz from the mem decomposition of the first year observations @xcite .",
    "a fake polarized synchrotron emission template was constructed by @xcite based on the parkes 2400 mhz @xcite and haslam 408 mhz @xcite surveys .",
    "furthermore , the electromagnetic spectrum of synchrotron anisotropies and its spatial distribution are neither accurately known in temperature nor polarization although a first estimate was produced by @xcite .",
    "recently , the 23 ghz polarized wmap data is used as a tracer of the synchrotron polarization @xcite . for the thermal dust emission",
    "a full sky map at 100  @xmath13 m as well as templates for cmb use were extracted from the iras and firas data @xcite .",
    "no realistic template exists for the dust polarized emission , although a fake one , based on the polarization angles measured at 23 ghz has been constructed by the planck collaborationbernard / psm/ ] .",
    "the dust emission in temperature can be approximated by a grey body spectrum of mean temperature 17  k and emissivity between 1.7 and 2.2 @xcite .",
    "currently no measurement on the electromagnetic spectrum of the dust polarized emission is available although it is expected to be the same that for temperature @xcite .    to try to overcome the above limitations , a great amount of work has been dedicated to design and implement algorithms for component separation which can discriminate between cmb and foregrounds .",
    "these methods can also extract , directly from the cmb data , the emission properties of foregrounds .",
    "wiener filtering has been successfully tested assuming known gaussian priors for each component and with the electromagnetic spectrum of the anisotropies as an input @xcite .",
    "maximum entropy based methods ( mem ) , assuming entropic priors for the spatial distribution of each of the component , have been intensively used for small sky patches @xcite and extended to full sky analysis @xcite .",
    "they were adapted to account for spatial anisotropies in the electromagnetic spectra @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite has developed a new method to perform cmb component separation by parameter estimation and applied it to temperature simulations of the planck satellite experiments .",
    "independent component analysis ( ica ) techniques have also been applied to planck simulations in temperature @xcite and extended to polarization @xcite using the fastica algorithm .",
    "these methods require no prior on the spectral or spatial distribution of the components but can not make use of the available physical knowledge on the foreground and cmb emissions .",
    "in addition , the spectral matching independent component analysis ( smica ) @xcite has been developed to consider both the fully blind analysis for which no prior is assumed and the semi - blind analysis incorporating previous physical knowledge on the astrophysical components .",
    "this algorithm , based on the expectation - maximization algorithm ( em ) @xcite , uses the spectral diversity of the components and was developed for temperature only .",
    "we present in this paper , polemica ( polarized expectation - maximization independent component analysis ) , an extension of this method to polarization including both the blind and semi - blind analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . a simple model of the microwave sky emission in temperature and polarization",
    "is described in section  [ simus ] .",
    "section  [ mdmc ] presents the polemica multi - detectors multi - components ( md - mc ) blind component separation algorithm .",
    "section  [ simus_list ] describe the simulations of the planck satellite experiment used for testing the algorithm .",
    "we present in section [ testing ] the application of polemica to the planck simulations with a _ simplified _ model to test the algorithm s performances .",
    "finally , in section [ realistic_model ] , we apply our algorithm to more _ realistic _ planck simulations and discuss the separability problem in this case",
    ". we summarize and conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "to constrain cosmological models , cmb experiments have to reach an accuracy which is well below the expected level of contamination from astrophysical foregrounds , in temperature and even more critically in polarization .",
    "therefore , an efficient separation between cmb and foregrounds is crucial for the success of future polarization experiments . to perform such a separation ,",
    "the diversity of the electromagnetic spectra of the anisotropies and of the spatial spectra of the components is generally used .",
    "observations from a multi - band instrument can be modeled as a linear combination of multiple physical components leading to what is called a multi - detectors multi - components ( md - mc ) modeling .",
    "assuming an experiment with @xmath14 detector - bands at frequencies @xmath15 and @xmath16 physical components in the data , for each stokes parameter ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and for each pixel on the sky map we can write    y^(*r*)=a^_cs^c(*r*)+n^(*r * )    where @xmath20 is the map of the @xmath21 component , @xmath22 refers to the noise map for each @xmath15 band and @xmath23 which is called the _ mixing matrix _ , gives the electromagnetic spectrum behavior for the component @xmath21 and frequency @xmath15 .",
    "beam smoothing and filtering effects are not considered in this work .    as in the temperature case",
    ", it is more convenient to work in spherical harmonics space , where equation ( [ datareal ] ) can be rewritten independently for each @xmath24 assuming a full sky coverage .",

    "the aim of the component separation algorithm presented in this paper is to extract @xmath31 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 from the @xmath26 sky observations .      following the md - mc model discussed above and given an observational setup , we construct , using the healpix pixelization scheme @xcite and in cmb temperature units , fake @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 maps of the sky at each of the instrumental frequency bands . for these maps",
    "we consider three main physical components in the sky emission : cmb , thermal dust and synchrotron .",
    "concerning emissions that are not expected to be significantly polarized , we have optionally considered unpolarized free - free emission and not taken into account the sz emission as we are interested in diffuse emissions .",
    "when no free - free is considered and in any cases for the sz emission , we suppose that they have been successfully removed from our sky maps in temperature .",
    "we have assumed that the free - free emission is not polarized .",
    "instrumental noise is modeled as white noise .",
    "the cmb component map is randomly generated from the polarized cmb angular power spectra computed with the camb software @xcite for a set of given cosmological parameters . in the following",

    "we also consider gravitational lensing effects as described in @xcite .      for the diffuse galactic synchrotron emission we use the template maps in temperature and in polarization provided by @xcite .",
    "these template maps were derived in temperature directly from the haslam map at 408 mhz @xcite .",
    "the polarization maps in @xmath18 and @xmath19 were constructed from the intensity map from a constrained realization of the polarization angles using the parkes 2400  mhz survey @xcite .",
    "a template of the spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral index is also provided by @xcite .",
    "here we have chosen to use a constant spectral index equal to the mean of the spectral index map , @xmath38 , so that the simple linear model of the data holds .",

    "there is a scale indetermination on the value of @xmath44 and @xmath75 and only the product @xmath76 is scale invariant .",
    "thus , to ease the convergence of the algorithm , we renormalize each column of @xmath44 to unity at each em iteration and correct the @xmath75 density matrix accordingly so that the product @xmath76 is unchanged .      to start - up the em algorithm the parameters of the fit , @xmath77 , need to be initialized to reasonable values to avoid exploring local maxima in the likelihood function .    in the case of the mixing matrix , @xmath44 , we can consider , in a first approximation , that the electromagnetic spectrum is the same in temperature and polarization for each of the components .",
    "therefore , we can concentrate on guessing the electromagnetic spectrum in the temperature data where we expect the signal to noise to be larger .",

    "it is important to remark that the reconstruction of the electromagnetic spectra for temperature and polarization is performed independently .",
    "we observe that the error bars are larger for polarization than for temperature as we would expect from the smaller signal to noise ratio in polarization .",
    "the _ simplified_-dust electromagnetic spectrum is reconstructed with no bias both in temperature and polarization even at the lowest lfi frequency channels .",
    "furthermore , the reconstructed synchrotron electromagnetic spectra in polarization are not biased . in temperature",
    "we observe that the spectrum flattens out at intermediate frequencies between 70 and 217  ghz .",
    "this is the cause of the slight mixing up between synchrotron and cmb .",
    "this mixing up does not happen in polarization for which the synchrotron emission dominates over the cmb emission . finally , the reconstruction of the cmb electromagnetic spectrum from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes , although noisy for the latter , is not biased .",
    "however for the @xmath2 modes the reconstruction is very poor because of the very low signal to noise ratio ( below @xmath111 for @xmath112 ) .",
    "we have repeated the analysis with no prior in the electromagnetic spectrum of the cmb .",
    "we use instead the eigenvector corresponding to the third larger eigenvalue of the data density matrix .",
    "the results for dust and synchrotron remain unchanged . for cmb the electromagnetic spectrum at 30 and 353",
    "ghz is not reconstructed neither in temperature nor in polarization and the results for @xmath2 are significantly degraded at all frequencies .",
    "however , the results on the reconstruction of the spatial power spectra remain unchanged for all the physical components including cmb .",
    "this can be easily understood as the reconstruction of the cmb power spectra is mainly dominated by the intermediate frequency maps , from 70 to 217  ghz , where the @xmath44 matrix is accurately reconstructed .      in the previous analysis",
    "we have computed the electromagnetic spectrum of the physical components independently for each mode @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in a more realistic approach",
    "we should consider a single electromagnetic spectrum for the polarization @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes which may be different from the temperature one .",
    "we have repeated the analysis under the above hypothesis and the results remain roughly the same with respect to the reconstruction of the spatial power spectra and of the electromagnetic spectrum . for synchrotron and",
    "_ simplified_-dust the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes have roughly the same power in our simulations and therefore we expect only variations in the error bars . for cmb",
    "the @xmath1 mode largely dominates the @xmath2 mode and therefore we expect no significant contribution from the latter to the electromagnetic spectrum reconstruction .",
    "the differences between the temperature and polarization electromagnetic spectra are expected to be small for dust and synchrotron @xcite and none for the cmb @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of a perfectly calibrated experiment , we can consider , in a first approximation , that the polarization and the temperature electromagnetic spectra are the same .",
    "the _ blind _",
    "analysis of the * * simulations under this hypothesis shows no evidence of mixing up between synchrotron and cmb .",
    "this can be clearly observed in the second row of figure  [ fig : amat128 ] where we represent from left to right the reconstructed electromagnetic spectrum of the dust , synchrotron and cmb emissions respectively .",
    "no bias is observed for any of the physical components including synchrotron for which the flatten out of the spectrum observed before is not present .",
    "figures  [ fig : tpqspectplanckcmbfgd128 ] and [ fig : tpqspectplancksyncfgd128 ] show the cmb and synchrotron reconstructed spatial power spectra in temperature and polarization .",
    "we do not observe a bias neither on the synchrotron nor on the cmb @xmath3 power spectra .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the cmb @xmath5 modes , although biased at large @xmath52 values , are fairly reconstructed up to @xmath113 . for the other modes , the results are similar to those presented in the previous section .",
    "the separation method allows us to easily include previous knowledge on the physical components either as priors or as facts . in the previous section we considered a prior on the cmb emission . in",
    "the following we move a step forward in the analysis assuming the cmb electromagnetic spectrum known and performing what we call a _",
    "cmb semi - blind _ analysis . for this analysis ,",
    "the columns of the mixing matrix corresponding to the cmb are initialized to the cmb electromagnetic spectrum and are not updated by the algorithm .",
    "for the other components we consider independent electromagnetic spectra for temperature and polarization and they are initialized as for the _ blind _ analysis .",
    "the third row of figure  [ fig : amat128 ] shows the reconstructed mixing matrix for the _ cmb semi - blind _",
    "analysis considering the * * simulations .",
    "the results are similar to those of the _ blind _ analysis discussed before .",
    "the dust electromagnetic spectrum is accurately recovered in temperature and polarization . for synchrotron ,",
    "the polarization spectrum is accurately recovered but the temperature one flattens out at intermediate frequencies with respect to the input model .",
    "therefore , the reconstructed _ simplified_-dust and synchrotron spatial power spectra in temperature and polarization are similar to those of the _ blind _ analysis .",
    "simplified_-dust power spectra are accurately reconstructed in temperature and polarization . for synchrotron the power spectra",
    "are also accurately reconstructed except for the @xmath3 mode which present a slight bias ( below 20% ) at large angular scales ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "in general the error bars are smaller for the _ cmb semi - blind _ analysis .",
    "the reconstructed cmb power spectra for the _ cmb semi - blind _",
    "analysis are represented in black on figure  [ fig : semiblindplanckcmbfgd128 ] .",
    "all of them are accurately reconstructed with no bias except for the @xmath5 mode .",
    "for the latter the reconstruction is accurate up to @xmath113 and there on is biased .",
    "this bias is due to residual noise and is not related to the uncertainties on the reconstruction of the electromagnetic spectrum for the other physical components . to check this",
    "we have also performed a _ a - fixed _ analysis assuming the electromagnetic spectrum of all physical components known .",
    "the results of this analysis are overplotted in red on the figure .",
    "we observe that reconstruction is equivalent to that of the cmb _ semi - blind _",
    "analysis but for the error bars which are smaller this indicates that the bias in the @xmath5 mode is mainly due to residual noise as discussed in section  [ sec : colornoisemodel ] .    [ sec : discusions ]                  in the previous section we have fully described the analysis of the * * simulations at @xmath115 for which the reconstruction of the spatial power spectra was limited to @xmath98 . in some cases we have observed small biases in the polarization auto power spectra at large @xmath52 values which may be due to pixelization problems ( we exclude in here the bias observed in the cmb @xmath5 modes which is due to residual noise ) . to check this hypothesis",
    "we have also performed the _ blind _ , _ cmb semi - blind _ and _ a - fixed _",
    "analysis on the * * simulations for which we can reconstruct the angular power spectra up to @xmath116 .",
    "as the resolution of the planck best channels is @xmath117 arcmin a more realistic analysis will require simulations at @xmath118 which are far too much time demanding for our computational capabilities .",
    "the results obtained for the * * simulations are very similar to those for the * * ones . for illustration figures  [ fig : cmbfgd512planck ] ,  [ fig : dustfgd512planck ] and  [ fig : syncfgd512planck ] show the reconstructed temperature and polarization power spectra for cmb , _ simplified_-dust and synchrotron in the case of a _ cmb semi - blind _ analysis .",
    "the synchrotron and _ simplified_-dust power spectra are accurately reconstructed in temperature and polarization .",
    "we observe a slight bias in the dust @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes as for the * * simulations but at much larger @xmath52 values .",
    "this indicates that this bias is related to pixelization effects .",
    "the same effect is observed for the cmb power spectra .",
    "the bias in the @xmath4 modes is present at much larger @xmath52 than for the * * simulations .",
    "the reconstruction of the cmb @xmath5 modes is accurate at low @xmath52 ( @xmath114 ) and present a residual noise bias at large @xmath52 values as discussed in the previous section .          as seen before ,",
    "the bias observed in the cmb @xmath5 power spectrum is most probably due to residual noise from the separation .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to check both the accuracy of the noise reconstruction and the limitations of the white noise model imposed .",
    "with respect to the latter we have repeated all the analysis presented above assuming a color noise model such that the noise power spectra are estimated for each bin @xmath54 in @xmath52 . for the _",
    "blind _ analysis the results are slightly worse in the sense that the mixing up between cmb and synchrotron is more significant .",
    "this is not surprising since the noise in the data is white and we are artificially reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the fit .",
    "actually , the mismatch between the data and the physical component power spectra can be compensated by changing the noise power spectra . in the case of the _ cmb semi - blind _ and _ a - fixed _ analysis the results for the white and color noise model present no significant differences .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise128 ] shows , in black , the reconstructed noise angular power spectra , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , in @xmath122 , at 100  ghz for the * * simulations in the case of a _ cmb semi - blind _ analysis .",

    "the noise spectra are reconstructed down to the accuracy of the estimation of the input model both for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , well below 10@xmath123  % .",
    "for the @xmath5 noise spectrum there is a small bias which is of the order of @xmath124  % at @xmath125 and around @xmath126  % at @xmath127 .    therefore , to improve the reconstruction of the cmb @xmath5 modes we need a better estimation of the @xmath5 noise power spectrum . for this purpose",

    "@xcite complemented the em algorithm with a direct maximization of the likelihood function via a newton - raphson algorithm . for polarization similar algorithms",
    "can be used but due to the degree of complexity of the problem ( 6 correlated modes per physical component instead of 1 in the temperature only case ) and for the sake of clarity these will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "after testing intensively our algorithm on our _ simplified _ model , deducting the global performances of the spectral matching reconstruction in temperature and polarization we are interested in the performances of the algorithm for significantly spatially correlated components . for this purpose",
    ", we have used the * [ planck  d ] * simulations .                    with this set of simulations , we have performed several types of separations .",
    "first , we have worked on a joint temperature and polarization analysis , similar to the one presented in section [ testing ] .",
    "then we have considered temperature - only separation , and polarization - only separation . for each of the described cases",
    "we have applied the algorithm with the different degrees of freedom presented in section [ testing ] .",
    "models and recovered data are average over bins of size 10 in @xmath52 beginning at @xmath128 .",
    "error bars presented in this section represent the dispersion over 100 simulations .",

    "we present here the results obtained in the _ a - fixed _ separation case , considering the 4 simulated components . in this particular case ,",
    "the algorithm is very slow to converge and thus 40000 em iterations have been run .",
    "the recovered angular power spectra for temperature and polarization are displayed from figure [ 4comp_realistic_cmb ] to figure [ 4comp_realistic_ff ] , respectively for cmb , _ realistic _ dust , synchrotron and free - free emissions and compared to the input model .",
    "for the cmb component , on figure [ 4comp_realistic_cmb ] we can see that @xmath103 and @xmath106 are recovered accurately up to @xmath131 .",

    "@xmath103 is well recovered up to @xmath134 but then converge sharply to a null signal and therefore a residual noise bias similar to the one of @xmath105 occurs .",
    "this is not directly visible in the temperature spectrum but can be seen in the cross temperature and polarization spectra .",
    "indeed , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are well recovered up to @xmath134 and further many points are strongly biased .",
    "finally , results corresponding to the free - free emission component are displayed in figure [ 4comp_realistic_ff ] .",
    "@xmath103 is recovered with a good accuracy up to @xmath129 . as for polarization",
    "the input signal is null , we can see in the recovered spectra the overall behavior of our algorithm described in section [ testing ] .",

    "for both of them , excepting the dust component which is well constrained in all cases due to its dominant power at high frequencies , the algorithm fails to converge and then components are mixed and results strongly biased .",
    "this may come from the fact that free - free and synchrotron electromagnetic spectra are similar and to the fact that all the galactic emissions have strong spatial correlations . in the following section we will address this problem and show that this mixing that prevents the convergence of the algorithm is mainly due to the separability problem that occurs in temperature . in section [ pol_sep ]",

    "we can see that except the synchrotron spectrum which start to be biased at @xmath134 , for the reason advanced in the last section , spectra are recovered with a good accuracy for the dust , cmb and free - free components up to @xmath129 .",
    "we have also performed the separation for the _ cmb - fixed _ and the _ blind _ cases . as for the joint analysis , excepting again the dust component for which the spectrum is recovered efficiently , the algorithm fails to converge .",

    "comparable results and the same performances of the algorithm with respect to the level of prior we assume are observed when no free - free component is included in simulations .",

    "the reconstruction of the cmb component is displayed in figure [ eb_3comp_cmb_blind ] .",
    "for @xmath104 we can see that the reconstruction is similar to the one in the _ cmb semi - blind _",

    "however , the @xmath105 spectrum is not recovered .      from the previous",
    "analyzes we have clearly identified a separability problem when dealing with more than one realistic diffuse galactic emission component .",
    "this problem appears both in the joint temperature and polarization and in the temperature - only analyzes , but not in the polarization - only one .",
    "this would indicate that it is mainly due to the high level of correlation of the galactic diffuse emission in temperature both in the galactic plane and at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the current version of our algorithm assume uncorrelated components and therefore we expect it to behave badly when they are correlated .",
    "work is in progress to adapt polemica to account for spatially correlated components .    for polarization - only separation",
    "the correlation problem seems to be not significant and the _ cmb semi - blind _ and _ blind",
    "_ analyzes are possible .",
    "therefore , for this case , we can evaluate the loss of accuracy in the reconstruction of the cmb signal due to the foreground contamination .",
    "for this , we compare the error bars on the cmb power spectra for the _ a - fixed _ , _ cmb semi - blind _ and _ blind _ separations to the one obtained in the case of a _ a - fixed _ separation on * [ planck  b ] * simulations containing cmb and noise only .",

    "this means that in the context of our _ realistic _ model , we have no need to put priors on the foregrounds electromagnetic spectra in polarization to perform an efficient separation . in",
    "the _ blind _ case , error bars of the reconstruction are increased by a factor 1.59 for @xmath104 , 13.5 for @xmath105 ( but the reconstruction is biased ) and 2.52 for @xmath108 . on the other hand , these results",
    "stress the fact that having priors on the cmb electromagnetic spectra inside of our algorithm helps to perform a more accurate separation .",
    "we present in this paper the polemica algorithm which is an extension to polarization of the smica temperature md - mc blind component separation method developed by @xcite .",
    "both algorithms work in harmonic space and are based on the spectral matching of the data to a noisy linear mixture of uncorrelated physical components using the em algorithm to maximize the likelihood function . by contrast to the temperature data which are described by a single scalar quantity @xmath0 , the combined temperature and polarization data are described in harmonic space by three correlated scalar quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 corresponding to the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 stokes parameters in real space .",
    "we have developed a new formalism to jointly deal with the 6 resulting auto and cross angular power spectra , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    using this formalism",
    "we have constructed the likelihood function and proved that the em algorithm can be also applied to polarization data . under the assumption of uncorrelated gaussian distributed components and noise , the free parameters in the fit are the mixing matrix describing the electromagnetic spectrum of the physical components for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the temperature and polarization angular power spectra of the physical components and the temperature and polarization noise power spectra for each of the detectors .",
    "+ we have , as a first approach , intensively and successfully tested the polemica method on simulations of the planck satellite experiment considering a 14-months nominal mission and no systematic effects . for these tests ,",
    "we suppose a _",
    "simplified _ linear model for the sky emission including cmb , synchrotron with constant spectral index and _ simplified_-dust ( gaussian realization ) emissions .",
    "we construct full sky maps for all the polarized channels from 30 to 353  ghz including at least one of the above physical components and considering white noise and infinite resolution .",
    "the method permits blind separation on these simulations allowing us to reconstruct the noise and physical component s temperature and polarization power spectra as well as the mixing matrix when we consider equal electromagnetic spectrum in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "when we relax this hypothesis the reconstruction of the electromagnetic spectrum for the cmb @xmath2 modes is significantly degraded as could be expected because of the low signal to noise ratio .",
    "these results indicate that the polemica method allows us to both constrain the electromagnetic spectrum of the physical components and also to inter - calibrate the data based on the reconstructed cmb electromagnetic spectrum . + after setting the general performances of the algorithm ,",
    "we have performed the separation on a more _ realistic _ model that includes _",
    "realistic_-dust , synchrotron and free - free components in section [ realistic_model ] .",
    "we have encountered in this case a separability problem , that mixes up components and prevents the algorithm to converge , when performing _ blind _ separations .",
    "we have shown that this is due to spatial correlations between galactic components in temperature .",
    "thus , when working on sets of @xmath18 and @xmath19 maps and maximizing the likelihood for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 modes only , this separability problem does not occur and _ cmb semi - blind _ and _ blind _ separations are possible .",
    "for this _ polarization - only _ case , we have shown that considering our _ realistic _ sky model and our algorithm , in the planck case , we have no need to put priors on the galactic components electromagnetic spectra to reconstruct the cmb polarized power spectra . nevertheless , adding priors on the cmb electromagnetic spectrum helps to perform a more accurate separation .    finally , real experiments present finite resolution , partial effective sky coverage , systematic effects and , often , correlated noise .",
    "all these issues must be dealt with by the component separation algorithms and will with no doubt significantly limit the precision to which the cmb signal may be reconstructed .",
    "polemica , as it was already the case for smica , can account for beam and filtering smoothing .",
    "systematic effects and correlated noise can be modeled as extra components in the data for which the spectral dependence can be estimated in a _ blind",
    "_ analysis .",
    "moreover , the strong spatial correlation in temperature between galactic physical emissions : dust , synchrotron and free - free , is a major problem for blind component separation algorithms which generally assumed uncorrelated components . although not observed yet , we can also imagine spatial correlation of the galactic emissions in polarization .",
    "work is in progress to adapt the polemica algorithm to the case of correlated components .",
    "in addition , foreground emissions have in general spatially varying electromagnetic spectra far beyond the simple linear model presented here .",
