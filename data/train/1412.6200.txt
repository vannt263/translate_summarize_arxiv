    "in order to find a clue on the quantum gravity problem in spacetime for which @xmath0 , a very rich model of different lower dimensional gravity has been developed . in the particular case of @xmath1 , it is well known that the einstein - hilbert action has been used as the gravity sector . however ,",
    "this model is locally trivial because the einstein - hilbert action in @xmath1 is just a topological invariant ( gauss - bonnet theorem ) .",
    "if we want to obtain the dynamical degree of freedom , we need to couple this action with different fields besides the gravitational one . under this perspective",
    ", the dilatonic field has shown a very rich structure and includes black hole solutions .",
    "the dilatonic field naturally arises , for instance , in the compactifications from higher dimensional gravity or from string theory .",
    "two dimensional dilatonic - gravity has black hole solutions that play an important role and reveal various physical aspects such as spacetime geometry , the quantization of gravity , and also the physics related to string theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , technical simplifications in two dimensions often lead to exact results , and it is hoped that this might help to address some of the conceptual problems posed by quantum gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "the exact solvability of two - dimensional models of gravity have been a useful tool for research in black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such lines of research are provided to give deeper understanding of some key issues , including the microscopic origin of black hole entropy @xcite , and the final stages of black hole evaporation @xcite . for a review of two dimensional dilaton gravity see @xcite , in the specific subject of black hole physics , these are several studies that have contributed to understanding the scattering and absorption properties of waves in black holes .",
    "because spacetime geometry surrounding a black hole is non - trivial , the hawking radiation emitted at the event horizon is modified by this geometry , and therefore an asymptotic observer measuring the black hole thermal spectrum , will measure a modified spectrum and no longer the well known black body thermal spectrum @xcite .",
    "the factors that modify the emitted spectrum of black holes are known as greybody factors and can be obtained through the classical scattering for fields under the influence of a black hole . because the nature of hawking radiation is quantum , the study of greybody factors allows increases the semiclassical gravity dictionary , and also gives further steps into the quantum nature of black holes , for a review about this topic see @xcite .    in the present work we study",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients , and the greybody factors of massive charged fermions fields on the background of two - dimensional charged dilatonic black holes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "greybody factors for scalar and fermionic field perturbations on the background of black holes have received great attention . in this context , it was shown that for all spherically symmetric black holes , the low energy cross section for massless minimally - coupled scalar fields is always the area of the horizon , where the contribution to the absorption cross section comes from the mode with lowest angular momentum @xcite . however , for asymptotically ads and lifshitz black holes , it was observed that , at the low frequency limit there is a range of modes with highest angular momentum , which contribute to the absorption cross section in addition to the mode with lowest angular momentum @xcite . also , it was observed that the absorption cross section for the three dimensional warped ads black hole is larger than the area , even if the @xmath2-wave limit is considered @xcite .",
    "recently it has been found that the zero - angular - momentum greybody factors for non - minimally coupled scalar fields in four - dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime tends to zero around the zero - frequency limit @xcite .",
    "otherwise , for fermionic fields , it was shown that the absorption probability for bulk massive dirac fermions in higher - dimensional schwarzschild black hole increases with the dimensionality of the spacetime and decreases as the angular momentum increases .",
    "for this spacetime , it was also revealed that the absorption probability depended on the mass of the emitted field , that is , that the absorption probability decreases or increases depending on the range of energy when the mass of the field increases .",
    "also , it has been observed that the absorption probability increases for higher radii of the event horizon @xcite , see for instance @xcite for the decay of dirac fields in higher dimensional black holes . for further reference ,",
    "massive charged scalar field perturbations of the kerr - newman black hole background were studied in @xcite , the absorption of photons and fermions by black holes in four - dimensions in @xcite , the fermion absorption cross section of a schwarzschild black hole in @xcite , and charged fermionic perturbations in the reissner - nordstrom anti - de sitter black hole background in @xcite . for higher - dimensional black hole background see @xcite . furthermore , fermionic perturbations on the background of two - dimensional dilatonic black holes have been studied in which it was shown that the absorption cross section vanishes at the low and high frequency limits . however , there is a range of frequencies where the absorption cross section is not null @xcite . besides , charged fermionic field perturbations",
    "have been studied in order to obtain the quasinormal modes and to study the stability of these black holes @xcite .",

    "let us begin with the effective action of maxwell - gravity coupled to a dilatonic field @xmath3",
    "@xcite @xmath4where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the central charge , and @xmath7 is the electromagnetic strength tensor . if we perform the variation of the metric , gauge , and dilaton field , we obtain the following equations of motions . @xmath8 in order to describe the black hole solution , we considered the following form of the static metric for charged black holes @xmath9 in this expression , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",

    "as it is well known , charged fermionic perturbations on the background of two - dimensional charged dilatonic black hole are governed by the dirac equation @xmath24where @xmath25 denotes the electromagnetic potential , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the charge and the mass of the fermionic field @xmath28 respectively , and @xmath29represents the covariant derivative @xmath30 . in this last expression",
