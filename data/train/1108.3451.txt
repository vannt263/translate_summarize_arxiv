    "in ambient conditions , the stable form of gallium oxide is the monoclinic structure of @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 @xcite , which belongs to the group of transparent oxides with a large band gap of 4.8 ev , and exhibits both conduction and luminescence properties @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 is generally an @xmath3-type semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies individually compensated by two electrons forming shallow donors @xcite .",
    "however , the number of oxygen vacancies present in the material depends on the growth atmosphere , and so the electrical character of the compound can vary , in a tunable way , from insulating to conductive @xcite . because of its tunable optical , magnetic and electrical properties , the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 has attracted much research interest for many technological applications @xcite .",
    "for example , ga@xmath0o@xmath2 is useful in the fabrication of masers @xcite , field - effect devices @xcite , switching memory devices @xcite , and transmitting ultraviolet light @xcite . by monitoring its electronic properties at different chemical atmosphere",
    ", the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 can also be used as sensors to detect hydrogen gases @xcite . to detect hydrogen molecules , it is revealed that oxygen vacancies are needed on the ga@xmath0o@xmath2 surface to explain the stretching frequencies of ga - h bonds observed in the infrared spectroscopy experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the special mechanism for oxygen vacancies to help dissociate hydrogen molecules has not been discussed yet .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath0-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 interaction is also important to some catalytic reactions . catalysts containing supported gallium are known to be active in light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization @xcite .",
    "recently , it is highlighted that @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 alone is able to dissociate hydrogen molecules at temperatures higher than 500 k and then hydrogenate adsorbed co@xmath0 stepwise from formate to methoxy groups @xcite .",
    "although the oxidation state of gallium ions has been of a matter of debate in catalytic reactions @xcite , the role of the geometric environment or surface coordinations has not been emphasized .",
    "there are two types of coordination for ga ions in the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 , namely tetrahedral and octahedral , and referred to as ga(i ) and ga(ii ) .",
    "there are also three types of oxygen ions , referred to as o(i ) , o(ii ) and o(iii ) .",
    "oxygen o(i ) and o(ii ) lie respectively in and out of the symmetry plane ( see fig .",
    "they are both in threefold coordination while o(iii ) is in fourfold coordination @xcite .",
    "the most frequent cleavage plane for @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 is the ( 100 ) plane @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical study of the ( 100 ) surface presents two possible surface terminations , a and b @xcite .",
    "termination a is characterized by rows of oxygen , and termination b by rows of nearest neighbor gallium and oxygen . in our study , we mainly focus on the surface relaxations for the stoichiometric and oxygen vacancy included @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surfaces , and the dissociation prorperties of hydrogen molecules on them .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our first - principles calculation methods ; in sec .",
    "iii , we present in detail our calculated results , including the comparisons of the electronic structures of the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface including oxygen vacancy or not , and the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the surfaces ; finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "our calculations are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the pw91 @xcite generalized gradient approximation and the projector - augmented wave potential @xcite are employed to describe the exchange - correlation energy and the electron - ion interaction , respectively .",
    "the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion is set to 400 ev , which is large enough to make the error from calculations of the adsorption energy below 0.01 ev .",
    "the stoichiometric and oxygen vacancy included @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surfaces are modeled by a slab composed of 30 atomic layers and a vacuum region of 20  .",
    "the @xmath4 supercell with the size of 5.93    @xmath5 6.11    is used to study the h@xmath0 adsorption .",
    "our test calculations have shown that this supercell is sufficiently large to avoid the interaction between adjacent hydrogen molecules .",
    "integration over the brillouin zone is done using the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite with @xmath6 point grids .",
    "a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.05 ev is chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around the fermi energy ( e@xmath7 ) by a finite-@xmath8 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath9 k. during geometry optimizations , the bottom 10 layers of the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface are fixed while other ga and o atoms are free to relax until the forces on them are less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the calculation of the potential energy surface for molecular h@xmath0 is interpolated to 350 points with different bond length ( @xmath10 ) and molecular height ( @xmath11 ) of h@xmath12 at each surface site .",
    "the calculated lattice constants of the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 crystal are @xmath13=12.45  , @xmath14=3.05  , and @xmath15=5.93  , and @xmath16=103.9@xmath17 , in good agreement with the experimental and theoretically calculated values @xcite .",
    "the calculated bond length of the free h@xmath0 molecule is 0.75  , also in good agreement with the experimental value of 0.74    @xcite .",
    "first , we do geometry optimizations for the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100 ) surface .",
    "there are two different types of ( 100 ) surface terminations , respectively called as the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)a and ( 100)b surfaces @xcite .",
    "the ( 100)a surface is formed by cleaving the ga - o(ii ) bonds above the o(ii ) atoms while leaving the below ga - o(ii ) bonds intact , and terminated in rows of o(ii ) s lying along the [ 010 ] direction .",
    "the ( 100)b surface is formed by cleaving the ga - o(ii ) bonds below the o(ii ) atoms , and terminated in nearest - neighbor rows of ga(ii ) and o(iii ) atoms , each singly unsaturated .",
    "after geometry optimizations , we find that the topmost o(i ) atoms move out on the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , and form o(i)-ga(ii)-o(ii ) rows as shown in fig .",
    "the calculated surface energies for the relaxed @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)a and ( 100)b surfaces are respectively 1.19 and 0.76 j@xmath18m@xmath19 , according well with other",
    "_ ab initio _ results of 1.13 and 0.68 j@xmath18m@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the surface energy values indicate that the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface is much more stable than the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)a surface .",
    "there are two kinds of oxygen vacancies on the relaxed @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , respectively the o(i ) and o(iii ) vacancies .",
    "after geometry optimizations , we find that the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface with the o(iii ) vacancy is 0.56 ev lower in total energy than with the o(i ) vacancy . the surface geometry of the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface with an o(iii ) vacancy ( ov - surface ) is shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , where the possible adsorption sites near the o(iii ) vacancy are depicted . on the ov - surface ,",
    "the o(i ) atom has a relatively large distortion .",
    "it moves 0.28    along the [ 00@xmath20 direction during surface relaxation .",
    "besides of introducing geometric distortions , the oxygen vacancy also changes the surface electronic structures .",
    "figure 2 shows the surface charge density of the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface and the ov - surface .",
    "the contour map shows the charge density distribution in the plane that is parallel to and 1.50    away from the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface . and the values are in the unit of @xmath21/@xmath22 .",
    "it is clearly shown that the o(i ) atom nearest to the o(iii ) vacancy has more electron distribution than on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , and so does the nearest o(iii ) atoms . using the bader topological analysis @xcite for the charge density",
    ", it is found that the nearest o(i ) atom gets 0.28 more electrons on the ov - surface than on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , it is also found that the two nearest ga(ii ) atoms and the nearest ga(i ) atom respectively get 0.61 , 0.62 and 0.34 more electrons on the ov - surface .",
    "these extra electrons are because that the vacancy of a surface o(iii ) atom supplies 2 more electrons to its nearby atoms .",
    "and the other 0.15 electrons is around the other surface oxygen atoms .",
    "the extra electrons around the surface ga atoms are easy to form ga - h bonds when hydrogen atoms are introduced .",
    "the projected density of states ( pdos ) for the nearest surface o(i ) atom on the ov - surface is shown in fig .",
    "3 , together with the pdos for a surface o(i ) atom on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface . from detailed wavefunction analysis",
    ", we find that there are strong @xmath23-@xmath24 hybridizations in the electronic states for ga(i ) and ga(ii ) atoms on the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , but the electronic states of surface o(i ) and o(iii ) atoms do not hybridize at all . in the pdos of an o(i )",
    "atom on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , the @xmath23 states lie around 15 ev below the @xmath24 states , and the @xmath24 electronic states contribute the majority part of the electronic states around the fermi energy . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , in the pdos of the nearest o(i ) atom on the ov - surface , there is a new peak ( peak 1 ) below the fermi energy , which represents for the electronic states of the 0.28 extra electrons due to the o(iii ) vacancy .",
    "since electrons near the fermi energy are easier to join in electronic hybridizations , the extra electrons around the surface o(i ) atom make it more active than on the stoichiometric ga@xmath0o@xmath2 surface .",
    "moreover , it is found from wavefunction analysis that the electronic states of peak 1 tend to occupy the oxygen @xmath25 orbital .",
    "these facts indicate that the electronic states around the o(i ) atoms are very easy to interact with a parallel hydrogen molecule . as we will see later",
    ", hydrogen molecules adsorbing around the surface o(i ) atom on the ov - surface do dissociate more easily .    after analyzing the surface electronic structures",
    ", we then study the adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules , both on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface and the ov - surface . as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , there are five high symmetry sites on the relaxed @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , respectively on top of the ga(i ) , ga(ii ) and oxygen atoms , and in the middle of two ga(i ) atoms and two oxygen atoms . in following discussions , we call them as the tg1 , tg2 , to , bg and bo sites . at each surface site , there are three possible orientations for an adsorbing hydrogen molecule , respectively along the @xmath26 ( [ 001 ] ) , @xmath27 ( [ 010 ] ) and @xmath28 ( [ 100 ] ) directions . after employing these notations , we will use tg1-@xmath29 , tg2-@xmath29 , to-@xmath29 , bg-@xmath29 , and bo-@xmath29 to represent the considered adsorption channels for hydrogen molecules .",
    "while studying the adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the ov - surface , we choose to to be the site directly on top of the o(iii ) vacancy , and tg1 and tg2 sites to be the sites on top of the nearest ga(i ) and ga(ii ) atoms .    to study the adsorption properties of h@xmath0 molecules , we do geometry optimizations after initially putting an h@xmath0 molecule 4.00    away from the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface and the ov - surface along all the above mentioned high symmetry channels .",
    "during the geometry optimizations , the bottom 10 layers of the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface are fixed while other h , ga and o atoms are free to relax until the forces on them are less than 0.01 ev /  . from these relaxation calculations , we find that there are no chemisorption states for h@xmath0 molecules on both the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface and the ov - surface .",
    "all the h@xmath0 molecules will finally evolve into the physisorption states , with the adsorption energies of several tens of mev .",
    "we calculate the two - dimensional ( 2d ) potential energy surface ( pes ) cuts to evaluate the dissociation properties of hydrogen molecules . along each adsorption channel , @xmath30 ranges between 0.40    and 4.00  , and @xmath10 ranges between 0.45    and 2.40  . from the calculated 2d pes cuts for h@xmath0 on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , we see no direct dissociation . as examples ,",
    "the 2d pes cuts along the tg1-@xmath31 , tg2-@xmath26 and to-@xmath27 channels are listed in figs .",
    "4(a)-(d ) .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "4(a)-(c ) , on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , hydrogen molecules are very hard to get close to surface ga atoms .",
    "the energy barrier for a hydrogen molecule in its molecular length of 0.75    to be 1.00    from the surface ga(i ) and ga(ii ) atoms is over than 12 ev .",
    "however , hydrogen molecules might be easier to get close to the o atoms on the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface . the energy barrier for a hydrogen molecule in its molecular length to be",
    "1.00    from the surface o(i ) atom is 5.2 ev , as shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) . in total",
    ", hydrogen molecules can not dissociate on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface .",
    "even the energy barriers for hydrogen to get closer to the surface is huge .",
    "these results indicate the inactivity of the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface to hydrogen molecules .",
    "similar to what we do for the 2d pes cuts of hydrogen molecules on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , we also calculate the 2d pes cuts of hydrogen molecules on the ov - surface . to make a comparison",
    ", we list the 2d pes cuts along the tg1-@xmath31 , tg2-@xmath26 and to-@xmath27 channels in figs .",
    "5(a)-(d ) .",
    "one can see from figs .",
    "5(a)-(c ) that the adsorption of hydrogen molecules does not change too much on top of ga(i ) and ga(ii ) atoms on the ov - surface , comparing with that on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface .",
    "however , the adsorption of hydrogen molecules change a lot on top of the o(i ) atom . as shown in fig .",
    "5(d ) , there is a clear dissociative adsorption state for hydrogen on the ov - surface , in which the bond length and molecular height of h@xmath0 are respectively 1.80 and 0.50  .",
    "the dissociation energy barrier for a hydrogen molecule to reach this adsorption state is 2.97 ev , which is much smaller than the approaching energy barrier on the stoichiometric @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface , indicating a big enhancement of the surface reactivity to hydrogen molecules .",
    "the pes results also approves our previous hypothesis that due to the extra electrons from the surface o(iii ) vacancy , the nearby o(i ) atom are easier to interact with hydrogen molecules .",
    "we also notice that the dissociation energy barrier of hydrogen molecules is still very large . but more importantly",
    ", we point out that surface oxygen vacancies can greatly enhance the activity of the @xmath1-ga@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 100)b surface to interact with hydrogen .",
