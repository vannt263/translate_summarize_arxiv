    "integral and differential equations with lumped and distributed parameters proved to be a useful and efficient tool for such studies . whereas evolution equations with lumped parameters have already been rather well investigated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , there still remain a lot of open questions for the case of dynamical systems with distributed parameters ( cp .",

    "the scope of the present paper is a linear one - dimensional heat equation in a bounded domain with discrete delay in terms of both lower and highest orders .",
    "recently , an abstract semigroup treatment was proposed for distributed systems with delays ( viz .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "though this rather general framework provides good analytical and control - theoretical tools for various delay scenarios , technical difficulties may arrive when applying to problems with delay in the highest order terms which have nevertheless been solved in @xcite for certain parabolic - type equations .",
    "another important problem consists in obtaining explicit representation formulas for the solutions to distributed evolution equations with delay .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details .",
    "such representation formulas can then be naturally used to carefully study the solutions , obtain semi - analytical approximations , address controllability and optimal control problems , etc .",
    "in @xcite , a nonhomogeneous one - dimensional heat equation with delay @xmath0 defined for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , was studied . the coefficients for the phase derivatives were assumed to be proportional , i.e. , there must exist a constant @xmath4 such that @xmath5 holds true . a dirichlet initial boundary value problem with nonhomogeneous initial @xmath6 and boundary conditions @xmath7 was considered under an additional compatibility condition on the data : @xmath8 performing the substitution @xmath9 equation ( [ new_eq1 ] ) was transformed to @xmath10 with @xmath11 whereby the initial and boundary conditions read as @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .    following @xcite",

    "moreover , the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are represented by uniformly and absolutely convergent fourier series given in ( [ eq5 ] ) or obtained by a term - wise application of @xmath38 or @xmath39 to ( [ eq5 ] ) , respectively .    using standard arguments from the elliptic theory ,",
    "the conditions of theorem [ theorem1 ] can be interpreted as a requirement for the data @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 to belong to certain sobolev spaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of functions with sufficiently many weak derivatives ( s. @xcite ) .",
    "the larger @xmath44 and @xmath45 are , the smoother the data are supposed to be .",
    "representing of the solution to the initial boundary value problem ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) in the form ( [ eq5 ] ) is not always convenient when the impact of the initial and boundary values or the inhomogeneity has to be treated separately . for our purposes , it is necessary to split corresponding terms into different sums .",
    "expanding the first sum in ( [ eq5 ] ) and performing integration by parts , we obtain @xmath46 plugging @xmath31 from equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , we get @xmath47 expanding the sum in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) and pluggin @xmath30 from equation ( [ eq7 ] ) yields @xmath48 thus , the solution @xmath35 to the initial boundary value problem ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) given in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath49 now , we collect appropriate terms in the following three operators  the first one depending on the initial data : @xmath50 the second one depending on the boundary data : @xmath51 and the third one depending on the inhomogeneity : @xmath52 thus , we arrive at @xmath53",
    "in this section , we consider the following exact controllability problem . given an initial state @xmath40 and boundary data @xmath54 , replace @xmath43 with a control function @xmath55 such that the solution @xmath35 to ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) is steered into a given final stale @xmath56 at a prescribed time @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath57 since we are interested in classical solutions , a compatibility condition on the boundary conditions and the end state has to be imposed : @xmath58    as it follows from the representation formula given in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , equation ( [ eq9 ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath59    we expand the functions @xmath56 and @xmath60 on the interval @xmath61 into fourier series with respect to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding elliptic operator . equation ( [ eq7 ] ) yields then @xmath62    we assume now @xmath55 to also have an expansion in fourier series of the form : @xmath63 the operator @xmath64 reads then as @xmath65 thus , the controllability condition rewrites as @xmath66 denote @xmath67 there follows then from ( [ eq10 ] ) that the controllability problem for an arbitrary time @xmath25 reduces to finding functions @xmath68 satisfying the following condition @xmath69 which is in its turn equivalent to a system of countably many fredholm integral equations of the first type : @xmath70    [ lemma1 ] for @xmath15 , @xmath71 , there holds for arbitrary @xmath25 @xmath72    there exists a unique @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 performing the integration , we obtain @xmath76 thus , we can write @xmath77 this completes the proof .    using lemma [ lemma1 ] , the integral equation ( [ eq12 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath78 where @xmath79 substituting @xmath80 into ( [ eq13 ] ) , we further obtain @xmath81    we look now for a solution of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 are constants depending on @xmath44 . plugging this into ( [ eq14 ] ) yields @xmath84    exploiting equation ( [ eq_lemma ] ) from lemma [ lemma1 ] , we can write @xmath85 thus , we obtain the following fourier coefficients for the control function @xmath86    summarizing the calculations above , we have proved the following statement .",
    "let @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath56 be such that the conditions of theorem [ theorem1 ] are fulfilled .",
    "then the control function @xmath87 with @xmath88 solves the exact controllability problem ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "we proved an exact controllability result in the classical settings for a one - dimensional heat equation with delay . for practical applications",
    ", it would though be desirable to extend these results to a weak framework as , for example , the one described in @xcite or even beyond it . for @xmath89 , using the maximal @xmath90-regularity property ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) for the elliptic operator in ( [ eq1 ] ) , the existence of a unique solution to ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) @xmath91 for the data @xmath92 can be deduced from @xcite .",
