    "the inclusion of next  to  leading qcd corrections to the effective low energy hamiltonian for non  leptonic decays requires the calculation of the relevant two  loop anomalous dimension matrices . in the case of the @xmath3 hamiltonian",
    "there are ten operators @xmath5 to be considered : current  current operators @xmath6 , qcd penguin operators @xmath7 and electroweak penguin operators @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , one deals with @xmath9 anomalous dimension matrices .",
    "because of the presence of electroweak penguin operators with wilson coefficients of @xmath10 , a consistent analysis must involve anomalous dimensions resulting from both strong and electromagnetic interactions . working to first order in @xmath11 but to all orders in @xmath12 , the following anomalous dimension matrix is needed for the leading and next  to  leading logarithmic approximation for the wilson coefficient functions , @xmath13    the one  loop matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 have been calculated long time ago @xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 submatrix of the two  loop qcd matrix @xmath17 involving current  current operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 has been calculated in ref .",
    "recently , we have generalized these two  loop calculations to the penguin operators @xmath20 @xcite , so that the full matrix @xmath17 is also known .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is the calculation of @xmath21 .",

    "loop diagrams involving one gluon and one photon . yet",
    "as will be seen the structure of basic expressions and of the results differs from the one found in the pure qcd case , because now the electric charges of quarks matter and the flavour symmetries present in ref .",
    "@xcite are broken .",
    "in fact this breakdown of flavour symmetry is the origin of the existence of electroweak penguin operators .    in order to make the comparison with the calculation of @xmath17 as easy as possible , we have organized the present paper in a similar way as it was done in ref .",
    "we present here however only the results in the naive dimensional regularization with anticommuting @xmath2 ( ndr ) .",
    "the consistency of the ndr and t hooft  veltman ( hv ) scheme for the calculation at hand has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "there we have developed a method which allows to avoid a direct calculation of penguin diagrams involving @xmath2 in closed fermion loops which are ambiguous in the case of the ndr scheme .",
    "our method can be generalized to the present case so that an unambiguous calculation of @xmath21 can be accomplished in the ndr scheme .",
    "this is gratifying because this scheme is certainly the most convenient and contrary to the hv scheme @xcite satisfies all ward  identities in the context of the minimal subtraction scheme .    our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we recall the explicit expressions for the operators @xmath22 , and we classify the one and two  loop diagrams into current  current and penguin diagrams .",
