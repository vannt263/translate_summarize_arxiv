    "localization @xcite is inherently a wave interference phenomenon @xcite and may therefore occur for both classical @xcite and quantum mechanical waves .",
    "it may be considered for all manner of excitations including electromagnetic , sound and ultrasound , acoustic and optic phonons , surface plasmons , polaritons , electrons and atoms .",
    "this article will discuss signatures of electromagnetic localization in the statistics of radiation reflected from and transmitted through random samples .",
    "the study of transport has been enriched by the many differences and similarities between electronic conduction and electromagnetic wave propagation .",
    "differences in the types of wave and their scattering interactions affect the types of measurements that can be carried out , as well as the possibility and ease with which waves can be localized . whereas classical waves may be phase - coherent in large static samples since wavelengths greatly exceed atomic dimensions , electronic samples must be cooled to ultra - low temperatures in order to suppress dephasing even in micron - sized samples . the value of the transport mean free path , @xmath4 , in which the direction of propagation is randomized , is determined by the specifics of the wave interaction in each material system . however , the character of classical and quantum propagation in mesoscopic systems , in which the wave is temporally coherent throughout the sample @xcite , is strikingly similar on length scales greater than both the wavelength and the mean free path .",
    "for both quantum and classical waves , the character of transport depends upon the closeness of the wave to the threshold of the localization transition separating extended and localized waves .",
    "ioffe and regel proposed that propagating waves can not exist if scattering occurs on a length scale smaller than @xmath5 , in which the amplitude of the wave changes .",
    "this suggests that propagation ceases when scattering is strong enough that , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the interference of waves that follow the trajectories in opposite senses around a closed loop enhances the return of the waves and thus suppresses transport . in weakly scattering three - dimensional systems ,",
    "the probability that a meandering wave trajectory will loop back to a typical coherence volume , @xmath8 , is @xmath9 .",
    "the impact of wave interference on average transport is therefore small when @xmath10 .",
    "the ensemble average of the spread of the square amplitude of the wave is then diffusive and corresponds to the random walk of electrons or photons .",
    "however , when @xmath11 , the probability that waves will return to a coherence volume is substantial .",
    "interference then impedes the escape from this volume .",
    "this consideration leads again to the ioffe - regel criterion for localization , @xmath12 .",
    "measurements of @xmath13 therefore give an indication of the closeness to the localization threshold .",
    "values of @xmath13 can be determined from measurements of the width of the peak of enhanced backscattering , which is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this peak has a triangular cusp with a maximum enhancement of retro - reflection over the diffuse background of a factor of 2 in the diffusive limit @xcite , and a smaller enhancement due to recurrent scattering events when the localization threshold is approached @xcite , as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the reflected enhancement peak is the fourier transform of the point spread function of the incident beam @xcite .    .",
    "the typical angular width varies as @xmath15 .",

    "the inset confirms the triangular cusp predicted by diffusion theory , and also shows that the maximum enhancement factor is lowered for the sample with small value of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "( with kind permission of the authors ) ]    the closeness to localization in diffusive samples can be ascertained from a determination of @xmath4 from measurements of the scaling of total transmission @xcite .",
    "measurements of optical transmission through a wedge - shaped sample of random titania particles dispersed in polystyrene are shown in fig .  2 @xcite . in the diffusive limit",
    ", the ensemble average of the spatial intensity distribution corresponds to the solution of the diffusion equation for the intensity .",
    "when absorption is absent , the average energy density falls linearly with depth inside the sample , corresponding to transmission which falls inversely with sample thickness , @xmath21 .",
    "when absorption is present in a diffusive sample , the ensemble average of both the energy density versus depth and the transmitted flux versus @xmath21 falls exponentially with attenuation length , @xmath22 , for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath25 is the absorption time @xcite .",
    "the variation of transmission as @xmath26 is seen in the log - log plot in fig .",
    "2a for @xmath27 , while the exponential variation of transmission for @xmath23 is exhibited in the semi - log plot in fig .",
    "transmission also falls exponentially as a result of wave localization in strongly scattering samples .     for @xmath27 and as ( b ) @xmath28 for @xmath29 m. from ref",
    ".  @xcite . ]    in three - dimensional samples , the diffusion coefficient is given by , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the transport velocity @xcite .",
    "the transport velocity is reduced when the wave is resonant with the constituents of the sample , and exhibits dips near mie resonances with spherical dielectric particles @xcite .",
    "the transport mean - free - path can be found once @xmath24 and @xmath31 has been determined .",
    "the diffusion coefficient can be determined directly from measurements of pulsed transmission @xcite or from the correlation function of the field or intensity with frequency shift @xcite .",
    "the field correlation function is the fourier transform of the ensemble average of the response to a short incident pulse @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient can also be determined in diffusive systems from the intensity correlation function with delay time in a medium in which the constituents are in random motion , such as in colloidal samples @xcite .",
    "the temporal correlation function reflects the average path length distribution in the medium , which is proportional to the average temporal evolution of transmitted pulses .    for bounded samples , in the absence of inelastic processes , however",
    ", any marker of localization must also depend upon the sample geometry , in addition to @xmath4 and @xmath32 , since reflection from the sample boundaries also returns the wave to points within the sample .",
    "when inelastic scattering is present , either the impact of inelastic scattering must be explicitly accounted for or a propagation parameter must be found , which still captures an essential aspect of localization and thereby directly expresses the closeness of the wave to the localization threshold .",
    "spectra of transmitted intensity for extended optical @xcite and microwave @xcite radiation , such as the microwave measurements shown in fig .",
    "3a @xcite , are composed of many overlapping lines which result in spectra without isolated peaks .",
    "the wave inside the medium , as well as each of the quasimodes , is extended in space . within the frequency range",
    "in which the wave is localized , however , distinct resonances are observed in the transmission spectrum @xcite , as seen fig .",
    "this spectrum of microwave transmission of localized waves was measured in a sample of alumina spheres at low density , contained in a copper tube , which was cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen to reduce absorption losses in reflection from the tube .",
    "when the wave resonantly excites the sample , its amplitude may be exponentially peaked within the sample @xcite .",
    "the relatively high intensity in the interior of the sample , as compared to near the boundaries , leads to long decay times for the excited mode and , consequently , to distinct narrow spectral lines .",
    "transmission via localized quasimodes is particularly high when intensity is peaked near the middle of the sample @xcite .",
    "transmission is also high when two or more quasimodes occasionally overlap spectrally leading to a multi - peaked intensity distribution extending through the sample , known as necklace states @xcite .",
    "because these short - lived states are spectrally broad , they dominate average transmission in 1d system . off resonance ,",
    "the overall energy density falls exponentially within the sample .",
    "localizing photons has proven to be a considerable challenge .",
    "photon states bound to subwavelength - scale particles do not exist as they do for electrons bound to ionic cores .",
    "in addition , @xmath33-wave scattering does not exist for photons , as it does for electrons . the electromagnetic scattering strength due to @xmath34-wave scattering vanishes in the long - wavelength , rayleigh limit , as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the particle radius .",
    "as a result , it is not possible to enhance scattering by packing many small scattering particles into volumes comparable to the wavelength .",
    "scattering for spherical particles is peaked at mie resonances , when the particle radius is comparable to @xmath32 .",
    "but then it is difficult to create strong scattering with @xmath4 as short as @xmath32 , since the maximum strength of scattering from individual particles is achieved only in dilute systems when scatterers are separated from one another .",
    "because photons are uncharged , however , a pure anderson localization transition between diffusing and localized waves might occur without the complication of the coulomb interaction .",
    "if this could be observed , it would be possible to determine the critical exponents of the anderson transition @xcite .",
    "in addition , the statistics of classical transport can be determined in large ensembles of equivalent samples . to date , photons have only been localized in three - dimensional systems with residual long - range order @xcite , in one- @xcite , two- @xcite , and quasi-1d @xcite samples , and in layered samples @xcite .",
    "john @xcite pointed out that waves can be localized in nearly periodic samples in the frequency range of the photonic band gap @xcite that forms in the associated periodic structure when the index of modulation is sufficiently large .",
    "though the density of states vanishes in large periodic structures , the introduction of disorder creates localized states in the spectral region of the photonic band gap . the low density of states within the spectral range of the photonic band gap and the narrow , spectrally isolated lines associated with the long residence time of light on resonance with these states lead to spatially localized modes",
    ". measurements of large microwave intensity fluctuations within the low frequency band gap of a cubic wire structure have indicated that localization occurs for intermediate filling fractions of metallic spheres floated within the structure @xcite .",
    "the relationship between average transmission and fluctuations in transmission lies at the core of the scaling theory of localization @xcite . in 1d",
    ", it has been hypothesized that the relationship can be expressed via a single parameter @xcite , which relates fluctuations in transmission , @xmath37 , to the ensemble average of the logarithm of transmission , which is normally distributed .",
    "the variance of the logarithm of the transmission in samples of length , @xmath21 , was conjectured to be , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the lyapunov exponent , which is the inverse of the localization length , @xmath40 , for localized waves @xcite .",
    "recently strong deviations from the single parameter scaling hypothesis have been predicted in the tail of a band in which the density of states is low @xcite .",
    "in addition to the localization length , @xmath41 , the scaling of transmission then depends upon a second length scale , @xmath42 , whenever @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this distance is the average spacing between localized states with frequencies between the given frequency and the edge of the band at which the density of states vanishes .",
    "the breakdown of single parameter scaling has also been demonstrated in 2d samples @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable interest in propagation and localization in quasi-1d samples .",
    "these samples are locally three - dimensional , but have reflecting transverse boundaries with length , @xmath21 , considerably exceeding the sample s transverse dimensions .",
    "since all modes are mixed in such systems , the statistics of propagation are the same at any point on the output surface .",
    "random matrix theory @xcite is well suited to such systems and has provided nonperturbative results that supplement the findings of diagrammatic perturbation theory in the weak scattering limit @xcite . at the same time , measurements of field , intensity , and total transmission in the frequency and time domains can be performed on random ensembles of quasi-1d samples . because of reflection at the transverse boundaries ,",
    "the wave is inhibited from straying far from a point in the transverse directions .",
    "the number of returns to a typical coherence volume , @xmath8 , increases superlinearly , as @xmath21 increases . as a result",
    ", the wave can always be localized as the sample length is increased while the cross sectional area remains fixed .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain a comprehensive statistical picture of propagation and localization in samples with well - defined statistical parameters in diffusive and localized samples @xcite .",
    "key properties that lend themselves to a universal description are the average values of transmission and conductance and their scaling , and the correlation and variance of local and spatially averaged flux or current . a variety of parameters capture the changing character of diverse aspects of wave propagation in the localization transition .",
    "the relationship between these phenomena and the parameters that characterize them are explicit in the absence of inelastic processes , since transport may be described in terms of a single parameter near the center of a band .",
    "indications of a breakdown of single parameter scaling in regions in which the density of states is low have not been found in measurements in locally 3d samples in the slab or quasi-1d geometries . when absorption is present , however , scaling can not be described in terms of a single parameter , and the resultant exponential reduction in transmission is not related to increasing localization of the wave .",
    "though the conductance can then no longer serve as a localization parameter , measures of correlation and fluctuations of transmitted flux may still be expressed through a single parameter which is a reliable indicator of the nature of wave transport .",
    "we will find that a clearer picture of wave propagation can be achieved once the effects of absorption and weak localization are disentangled .",
    "this can be done by transforming from the frequency to the time domain , since absorption has the same impact on all paths at a given delay from an exciting pulse .",
    "since the distribution of paths is not changed by absorption , relative fluctuations are unchanged at a fixed delay time @xmath3 from an exciting pulse .",
    "the temporal evolution of the wave can also be explored by studying its fourier transform , the field correlation function with frequency shift .    in the absence of inelastic processes ,",
    "the suppression of transport due to the enhanced return of the wave to a coherence volume may be described in terms of the average value of the dimensionless conductance @xmath0 , which is the scaling parameter @xcite of the anderson localization transition , @xmath44 . in a particular sample realization",
    ", the dimensionless conductance equals the transmittance @xmath37 , which is the sum of transmission coefficients over all @xmath45 input transverse modes , @xmath36 , and outgoing modes , @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the conductance is naturally measured in electronic experiments since the relative phase of the incident transverse current modes fluctuates randomly over the measurement time to yield the incoherent sum of transmission coefficients .",
    "in contrast , studies of classical waves are often carried out with coherent sources , so that it is natural to measure either the field or flux transmission coefficient for a single incident mode to a single outgoing mode or the total transmission which is the transmission coefficient for the net transmitted flux for a single incident transverse mode .    in quasi-1d samples ,",
    "the number of transverse modes in which two transverse wave polarizations are distinguished is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the sample cross section . in the diffusive limit , @xmath50",
    ", the dimensionless conductance can be approximated by @xmath51 .",
    "this is equivalent to ohm s law for diffusing particles , since @xmath52 . to order @xmath53 ,",
    "the conductance is reduced from the expression above by a factor of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "scaling of average transport is given in terms of the single parameter , @xmath0 , and the localization threshold is reached at @xmath55 @xcite , at which point @xmath0 is substantially reduced by renormalization due to weak localization . since the value of @xmath0 falls at least as fast as it does for diffusing particles , it is possible to localize waves in static systems by choosing sample lengths greater than the localization length , @xmath56 .",
    "this follows the analysis by thouless that electrons can be localized in sufficiently long wires when the temperature is low enough that dephasing can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the relationship of @xmath0 to localization may be seen from its connection to the thouless number , @xmath1 @xcite , which may be expressed as the ratio of the typical width and spacing of resonances of a random ensemble of samples , @xmath57 .",
    "the level width is the average leakage rate of energy from the electromagnetic quasimodes of the sample and is essentially the inverse of the width of the distribution of photon transit times through the sample when inelastic processes are absent .",
    "this corresponds to the width of the field correlation function with frequency shift @xcite and is given by @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the level spacing is the inverse of the density of states of the sample as a whole , and may be written as @xmath59 , where , @xmath60 is the number of states per unit volume per unit frequency , and @xmath61 is the sample volume . the thouless number is a measure of localization since transport is then suppressed by the poor overlap of quasimodes in different sectors of a sample when , @xmath62 , and hence , @xmath63 . when @xmath64 , on the other hand , quasimodes overlap spectrally and transport is relatively uninhibited . using the einstein relation for the conductivity , @xmath65 , the conductance can be written as @xmath66 .",
    "we can then write , @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the degree of correlation can be identified with @xmath68 , since , for monochromatic excitation , the number of quasimodes which are substantially excited is approximately the number of modes within the mode linewidth , which is @xmath69 .",
    "since the state of the wave in the sample is approximately specified by the amplitudes of these @xmath1 modes , it may be specified approximately by @xmath1 parameters . as a result ,",
    "the degree of correlation of intensity is approximately , @xmath68 , or equivalently , @xmath53 .    in the diffusive limit , @xmath50 , far from the localization threshold , the change in average conductance and the degree of long - range correlation in the flux due to wave interference",
    "are both of order @xmath53 .",
    "nonetheless , fluctuations in spatially averaged flux are dramatically enhanced over the values that would be obtained if long - range correlation were absent and the flux in each of the @xmath45 transmission modes could therefore be assumed to be statistically independent .",
    "if this were the case , the variance of total transmission normalized to its ensemble average value , @xmath70 , would be given by var@xmath71 , while the variance of the conductance normalized to its ensemble average , @xmath72 , would be given by var@xmath73 , when absorption is absent .",
    "instead , the variance of normalized total transmission over an ensemble is enhanced by a factor of @xmath74 , to give var@xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the variance of the normalized dimensionless conductance is enhanced by a factor of @xmath76 , to give var@xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a fixed value for the variance of the dimensionless conductance , var@xmath78var@xmath79 , where , @xmath80 .",
    "calculations , in accord with measurements , give var@xmath81 , independent of the size or local scattering strength of the sample @xcite . this is termed universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "the neglect of absorption in calculations of propagation makes it possible to highlight specific properties related to weak localization and mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "however , this is only rarely justified in practice .",
    "indeed , the attempt to deal with the reality of absorption has sharpened our understanding of the nature of localization and has provided clear signatures of localization .",
    "early discussions of photon localization were stimulated by the analogy between electron and photon transport .",
    "the impact of localization on the scaling of transmission was represented as a renormalization of local scattering parameters such as the mean free path or diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured that the renormalization of optical transport parameters would be cut off by absorption just as electron renormalization is cut off by dephasing @xcite .",
    "microwave measurements of the variation of transmission with thickness in strongly scattering mixtures of metal and dielectric spheres showed departures from diffusive behavior that were interpreted in terms of a scale dependent diffusion coefficient whose value saturated in samples longer than the attenuation length due to absorption @xcite .    on length scales shorter than the absorption length , the effective diffusion coefficient at the mobility edge is predicted to scale as @xmath26 and the transmission as @xmath82 , while the transmission is expected to fall exponentially for localized waves @xcite .",
    "such scaling was observed in microwave measurements @xcite , but absorption also leads to a more rapid fall - off of transmission in diffusive media @xcite .",
    "subsequently , similar scaling was observed in optical measurements in very weakly absorbing and strongly scattering samples of gaas powders together with a broadening of the coherent backscattering peak @xcite .",
    "but the role of absorption might still be significant enough to affect these measurements in view of the lengthened dwell time for waves in strongly scattering samples @xcite .",
    "the closeness to the localization threshold in such systems can be ascertained , however , in a variety of statistical properties of the scattered wave , which will be discussed below .",
    "the interaction of absorption and localization was probed in computer simulations of the temporal variation of the spatial distribution of acoustic energy in an absorbing 2d random sample that is isolated from its surroundings .",
    "the vibrational amplitude showed an exponential fall - off with displacement from the single line which was initially vibrating , that persisted in time @xcite .",
    "this demonstrated that though net energy transport is reduced by absorption , the wave is localized and does not spread throughout the sample .",
    "this is understandable since partial waves following a loop in two opposite senses are in phase , when these return to the initial scattering center .",
    "thus the impact of weak localization is undiminished for the surviving partial waves .",
    "the time dependence of flux within a medium can be treated separately from the loss of energy due to dispersed absorption .",
    "the statistical impact of absorption at any time can be accounted for by simply multiplying all waves by the factor @xmath83 .",
    "this was demonstrated in measurements of field spectra of microwave radiation transmitted through a random ensemble of absorbing dielectric quasi-1d samples @xcite .",
    "the measured probability distribution of intensity was shown to be in accord with a single - parameter distribution , which is the measured variance of the intensity , as will be discussed below .",
    "it was further shown that the impact of absorption could be undone in a statistical sense by simply restoring the magnitude of the amplitude of all partial waves emerging from the sample to the value these would have had if absorption were absent without altering the wave .",
    "this is done by transforming field spectra into the time domain by multiplying each spectrum by a gaussian spectrum associated with the gaussian temporal profile of the incident field amplitude .",
    "this product spectrum is then fourier transformed to give the temporal response to an incident pulse with the prescribed bandwidth .",
    "the field in the time domain is then multiplied by @xmath84 and transformed back to the frequency domain .",
    "the field transmission coefficient is then obtained by dividing by the gaussian field spectrum .",
    "the complex square of this spectrum is then computed to give the intensity spectrum from which the probability distribution of transmitted intensity is determined .",
    "the resultant probability distribution of steady - state intensity was found to be in excellent agreement with the prediction for samples without absorption @xcite .",
    "the distribution is then given in terms of the single parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "this demonstrates that statistically the impact of absorption at any time is simply to reduce the wave amplitude .",
    "absorption thus has a straightforward affect on transport in the time domain , and does not affect weak localization or the associated renormalization of scattering parameters at a specific delay time @xmath3 .",
    "this is confirmed by our finding that samples with identical scattering strengths but different values of absorption have the same degree of correlation at a given delay time .",
    "indeed , correlation is not suppressed by the increasing role of absorption for longer time delays , but is rather enhanced with increasing time delay . the reduction of steady - state intensity correlation in the presence of absorption",
    "is thus seen to be a result of the decreasing weight of longer paths with increasing absorption .",
    "finally , this analysis shows that the diffusion coefficient is independent of the value of the absorption coefficient .",
    "the role of weak localization increases with time since the probability that a wave trajectory will cross itself increases .",
    "we expect therefore that transport will be increasingly suppressed with time even in nominally diffusive samples with @xmath85 .",
    "an alternate picture of dynamic propagation would be that the initial pulse excites a distribution of quasimodes in the sample .",
    "the decay rate of transmission would then decrease in time since the amplitude of longer - lived quasimodes , which are more strongly peaked near the center of the sample , would increase relative to that of shorter - lived resonances . averaged over an ensemble of random sample realizations ,",
    "the distribution of leakage rates for quasimodes would be a continuum and would give rise to a continuous reduction of the leakage rate from the sample .",
    "both of these pictures of pulse dynamics are at variance with the particle diffusion picture that gives the ensemble average of intensity as a discrete sum over diffusion modes .",
    "the decay rates of the diffusion modes are given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a positive integer and @xmath88 is the boundary extrapolation length @xcite . after a time @xmath89",
    ", the intensity distribution would settle into the lowest diffusion mode and would decay at the rate , @xmath90 .",

    "a linear fall of the decay rate would be associated with a gaussian distribution of rates of decay for quasimodes .",
    "we find a slightly more rapid decrease of the decay rate which is associated with a slower than gaussian fall - off of the decay time distribution .",
    "the temporal variation of transmission can also be described in terms of the growing the impact of weak localization on the dynamic behavior of waves , which can be expressed via the renormalization of a time - dependent diffusion constant or mean free path @xcite .",

    "both overlapping and isolated spectral lines are observed .",
    "the presence of overlapping lines in the transmission spectrum of a layered material may have a number of causes .",

    "when @xmath93 , then , @xmath63 , and spectral lines are generally distinct . however , occasional overlap may occur .",
    "this has a strong impact on average transmission since the spatial distribution within the sample is quasi - extended and the transmission is consequently high @xcite . in samples with transverse inhomogeneity ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond a 1d model .",
    "spectral overlap is then produced by broadening associated with the widths of the distributions of the wave vectors in the incident beam and of the structure factor of the layered medium with transverse inhomogeneity .",
    "these additional factors give contributions to the @xmath94-vector distributions which are separately proportional to the inverses of the width of the incident beam and the transverse coherence length of the sample .",

    "microwave measurements on a slotted single - mode waveguides packed with random slabs show the impact of overlapping quasimodes within the sample @xcite .",
    "lasing is facilitated in localized modes because the excitation is able to penetrate deep into the sample with greatly amplified intensity when the pump laser is resonant with an exponentially localized mode @xcite .",
    "light is subsequently emitted into long - lived modes overlapping the region of excitation .",
    "this enhances the opportunity for stimulated emission and therefore lowers the laser threshold .",
    "in contrast , in diffusive media @xcite , excitation is restricted to the surface region by multiple scattering and the lasing threshold is not substantially reduced below the threshold for amplified stimulated emission in homogeneous media @xcite .",
    "localized modes and low threshold lasing were observed in stacks of glass slides with interspersed dye solution or dye - doped plastic sheets @xcite .",
    "sharp - line random lasing spectra are also observed in diffusive media @xcite , in which lasing is initiated in a single or small number of long - lived modes @xcite .",
    "lasing also occurs in localized states in nearly periodic anisotropic 1d sample .",
    "this is observed in disordered cholesteric liquid crystals . in the ordered structures , the director pointed along the average molecular axis in each layer rotates with well - defined pitch . a distinctive progression of band edge modes is then observed .",
    "but in liquid crystals in which periodicity has been disrupted to a lesser or greater extent , localized states form at the band edge .",
    "lasing then occurs in these states @xcite .",
    "lasing is also observed when a localized state is introduced into the band gap by a discontinuous jump in the angle of the director @xcite .",
    "in the absence of absorption , there is an explicit connection between average transport and mesoscopic fluctuations and correlation in quasi-1d samples since these can all be expressed in terms of a single parameter , @xmath0 . since this direct link between the averaged transmission and the statistics of transmission",

    "<S> the dimensionless conductance , @xmath0 , and the ratio of the typical spectral width and spacing of quasimodes , @xmath1 , are key indicators of electronic and classical wave localization when inelastic processes are absent . however , these can no longer serve as localization parameters in absorbing samples since the affect of absorption depends upon the length of the trajectories of partial waves traversing the sample , which are superposed to create the scattered field . </S>",
    "<S> a robust determination of localization in the presence of absorption is found , however , in steady - state measurements of the statistics of radiation transmitted through random samples . </S>",

    "<S> the intertwined effects of localization and absorption can also be disentangled in the time domain since all waves emerging from the sample at a fixed time delay from an exciting pulse , @xmath3 , are suppressed equally by absorption . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the relative weights of partial waves emerging from the sample , and hence the statistics of intensity fluctuations and correlation , and the suppression of propagation by weak localization are not changed by absorption , and manifest the growing impact of weak localization with @xmath3 . </S>"
