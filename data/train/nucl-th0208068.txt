    "from the particle ratios and the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions , one can obtain chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath2 and thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath3 through the analyses of statistical models @xcite .",
    "these temperatures are usually different from each other at the ags , sps and rhic energies , i.e. , @xmath4-@xmath5 mev while @xmath6-@xmath7 mev .",
    "this provides the following picture of space - time evolution of hadronic matter : the equilibrated system produced in the early stage of collisions first undergoes the chemical freeze - out where the observed particle ratios are fixed and then goes through the thermal freeze - out where the momentum distribution is fixed .",
    "however , one assumes @xmath8 in the conventional hydrodynamic models . as a result",
    ", one can not describe the particle ratios and spectra simultaneously . as a first trial",
    ", we incorporate the early chemical freeze - out into the hadronic equation of state ( eos ) @xcite for @xmath9 case @xcite and investigate its effects on hydrodynamic evolution such as radial flow , elliptic flow and hbt radii by using a fully three - dimensional hydrodynamic model ( 3d hydro ) @xcite .",
    "we construct two models eos to compare the space - time evolution of fluids .",
    "both models describe the first order phase transition between the qgp phase and the hadron phase at @xmath10 mev . here",
    "we take the baryonic chemical potential @xmath11 for simplicity .",
    "the qgp phase is composed of massless free u , d , s quarks and gluons and is common to both models .",
    "we employ the following two models for the hadron phase .",
    "one is the conventional resonance gas model in which chemical equilibrium is always assumed ( the model ce ) .",
    "we include all baryons and mesons up to the mass of @xmath12 .",
    "the other model describes the partial chemical equilibrium ( the model pce ) in the hadron phase @xcite . whether an interaction is chemically equilibrated in the hadron phase depends on its time scale .",
    "elastic scattering through a resonance particle , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , has large a cross section in the hadronic medium and frequently happens within the lifetime of fluids .",
    "hence these interactions are equilibrated in the model pce . on the other hand , particles",
    "which decay through the weak interaction have much longer lifetimes than the typical time scale of the fluid ( @xmath16 fm/@xmath17 ) .",
    "so those particles are assumed to be chemically frozen in the model pce . below @xmath2",
    ", we can introduce chemical potential @xmath18 associated with the conserved particle numbers .",
    "the ratio of the conserved number including contribution from resonance decays @xmath19 to the entropy @xmath20 has a constant value along an adiabatic path .",
    "thus we obtain the chemical potential as a function of temperature from the equation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the particle number density and the entropy density .",
    "we regard @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and its anti - particles as  stable \" particles and chemical potentials for all hadrons are represented by chemical potentials associated with these stable hadrons , e.g. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and so on .",
    "we note that the chemical potential of anti - nucleons is equal to that of nucleons in this model : @xmath33 .",
    "we choose initial parameters so as to reproduce the pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons for central ( 0 - 6% ) and non - central ( 35 - 45% ) au + au collisions at @xmath34 gev @xcite .",
    "the resultant maximum value of the initial energy density in collisions with vanishing impact parameter is 35 gev/@xmath35 at the initial time @xmath36 fm/@xmath17 . for collisions with finite impact parameters ,",

    "it is found that the @xmath38 slope is insensitive to the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath3 for the model pce while the @xmath38 slope from the model ce depends on @xmath3 .",
    "this is a consequence of the suppression of radial flow due to the early chemical freeze - out @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the @xmath38 spectra below 1.0 - 1.5 gev/@xmath17 and underestimate in higher @xmath38 region in the model pce analysis .",
    "this indicates that the hard contribution becomes important above 1.5 - 2.0 gev/@xmath17 .",
    "it should be noted that contribution from non - thermalized high @xmath38 partons with an appropriate amount of energy loss can fill in the difference between hydro results and the experimental data in the moderate high @xmath38 region ( @xmath39 gev/@xmath17 ) @xcite .     of charged hadrons in au + au central collisions at @xmath34 gev for the model",

    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are reduced by the early chemical freeze - out .",
    "this mainly comes from the reduction of the lifetime of a fluid @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the @xmath46 dependence of @xmath1 by the model pce , so the longitudinal dynamics can be correctly described by a hydrodynamic model with the finite longitudinal size and the chemical non - equilibrium property . on the other hand , we can not reproduce the transverse radii even in this model .",
