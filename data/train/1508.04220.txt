    "stars form in molecular clouds .",
    "there is much evidence that molecular clouds are turbulent , e.g. the observed molecular linewidth is much larger than the thermal linewidth . because the interstellar medium ( ism ) is turbulent , its velocity spectrum is self - similar , i.e. , a power - law , as evidenced in numerous studies ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) .",
    "turbulence in molecular clouds has been studied in a variety of scales and contexts .",
    "@xcite found for the first time a power law relation between the velocity dispersion @xmath7 and the ( projected , 2d ) size @xmath8 of molecular clouds @xmath9 .",
    "this power law form relation between the velocity dispersion and the size of molecular clouds is then called larson s relation . later observations",
    "established the now widely accepted index of 0.5 @xcite . the former index is close to the power law index @xmath10 of incompressible turbulence , while the latter may indicate density fluctuations within molecular clouds @xcite , which is confirmed in observational studies @xcite and numerical simulations with increasing sophisticated physics and resolution @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies on this topic bring more complications .",
    "@xcite find in north american and pelican molecular clouds a power law index of 0.43 for the larson s relation , which deviates from the traditional value of 0.5 . in another study",
    ", @xcite showed that the normalization of the velocity dispersion - size relation molecular clouds , @xmath11 , scales with the surface density of the clouds @xmath12 as @xmath13 , indicating that molecular clouds are in self - gravitational equilibrium .",
    "traditionally , structure function methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and principal component analysis ( pca , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used for characterizing the turbulent velocity field .",
    "recently , @xcite developed the core velocity dispersion ( cvd ) technique to study turbulence in the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "this method uses the centroid velocity ( average velocity of a core weighted with mass ) of identified molecular cores to sample the velocity field of spatially and spectrally coherent structures in relatively dense gas . in this paper",
    ", we compare the characteristics of the cvd with the gas turbulence and examine whether cvd could trace the general motion of the underlying gas .",
    "@xcite found that the dispersion of the core velocities increases with distance , i.e. cvd@xmath14 between 1 pc and 10 pc , which resembles larson s relation ( hereafter , we will attach the subscript 2d to @xmath8 as @xmath0 and 3d to @xmath15 as @xmath16 to emphasize the dimension of the spatial scales ) .",
    "larson s relation can be explained by the velocity spectrum of a 3d turbulent velocity field @xcite .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between the cvd-@xmath0 relation and the turbulent velocity spectrum , in that the turbulent velocity spectrum is three - dimensional , while the spatial scale in the cvd-@xmath0 relation is a projected ( 2d ) scale .    in this work",
    ", we expanded upon the previous results and study the influence of the line - of - sight scale ( thickness ) on the cvd-@xmath0 relation .",
    "we described our observational data in  [ sec : data ] , presented our methods in  [ sec : methods ] , and discussed results in  [ sec : results ] . in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarized our conclusions and addressed the potential application of the cvd in future studies .",
    "the @xmath17co ( j=1 - 0 , 110.2014 ghz ) data of taurus in this work were obtained with the 13.7 m fcrao telescope between 2003 and 2005 . the map is centered at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , with an area of @xmath20 , and a noise level of 0.1 k @xcite . the velocity resolution is 0.266 km / s .",
    "the @xmath17co data of perseus and ophiuchus came from the complete database @xcite , which were also observed with the fcrao telescope .",
    "the velocity resolution is 0.066 km / s .",
    "the noise levels of perseus and ophiuchus are 0.15 k and 0.2 k , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we used the gaussclumps method in the starlink software to identify cores from the data cube .",
    "the lower thresholds of the peak intensity of cores were set to be 7 times the noise level ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which were about 0.7 k , 1.0 k , and 1.5 k for taurus , perseus , and ophiuchus , respectively . in taurus , perseus , and ophiuchus ,",
    "588 , 693 , and 270 cores were identified , respectively .",
    "the typical size of the cores is around 0.1 pc .",
    "in order to investigate the influence of the cloud thickness on the cvd-@xmath0 relation , we used two approaches . in the first approach",
    "we statistically generate a sample of cores in a velocity field with second order structure function of index 0.5 , which corresponds to an energy spectrum of index @xmath21 . in the second approach",
    "we perform hydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds .",
    "cvd stands for core velocity dispersion , which is obtained as follows @xcite .",
    "first the difference of centroid velocity ( @xmath22 ) and projected spatial distance ( @xmath0 ) of each pair of cores are calculated .",
    "the distribution of @xmath22 in the @xmath23 plane is in grey scale in the top panel of figure  [ fig : vdis_all ] for the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "then we calculate the cvd , which is the mean square root of the values of @xmath22 , i.e. cvd @xmath24 , at different @xmath0 ( see the green diamonds in the top panel of figure  [ fig : vdis_all ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vdis_all ] is similar to figure 18 in @xcite , but now we focus on the power - law - form cvd-@xmath0 relation between 1 pc and 10 pc , which reflects the pattern of turbulent motion in taurus .    in order to compare the cvd to a turbulence velocity spectrum ,",
    "we fit a power law or a broken power law to the cvd-@xmath0 relation in this work .",
    "the break point of the broken power law is determined from the log(cvd)-log(@xmath0 ) plot by eye .",
    "the fitting error is estimated with a bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "we construct 100 samples of core pairs based on the real sample of core pairs , in which every pair in each sample is randomly selected from the data .",
    "then we fit parameters to these 100 samples , and the error is estimated by calculating the root of mean square of the fitted parameters . since there is degeneracy between the normalization and the index of a power law function , for power law fitting through out this paper , the power law index",
    "is first obtained by fitting a linear function to the log - log data and then fixed in the subsequent fitting in linear space , meant to obtain the offset constant .    , and the core velocity dispersion ( cvd@xmath25 ) vs.  the projected separation , @xmath0 , of the cores for the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "the background is an image of the number of data points in the @xmath23 plane , with the grey scale ( density bar at the top of the figure ) showing the density of points .",
    "the green diamonds represent the cvd in each separation bin .",
    "the cvd data points with apparent separation @xmath26 pc can be fitted with a power law of cvd ( km / s)@xmath27 .",
    "the horizontal line shows the mean cvd value , @xmath28 km / s , of data points with @xmath29 pc . _",
    "bottom _ : the cvd as a function of projected distance .",
    "the range of the power law fit is determined in this log - log scale plot .",
    "the fitting error is estimated with a bootstrap method.,width=302 ]      in order to study how well the core velocities correlate with the underlying velocity field and the cloud geometry , we formulate a simple statistical model , the fractional brownian motion model , of cores within a turbulent molecular cloud . the core sample is generated with procedures similar to those used in generating a turbulent velocity field @xcite . theoretically , the root of mean square turbulent velocity at scale @xmath15 ( scale length in 3d ) , @xmath30 , can be determined by the velocity fluctuations over scales smaller than @xmath15 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the wave number .",
    "if we assume @xmath33 , the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath1 will be @xmath35 in 3d . by definition , @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "we first generate a 3d velocity field and put roughly 4000 cores on a randomly selected set of grid points . a simple way to do this follows the procedure below .",
    "first , we generate a gaussian random field with dimension 128@xmath38128@xmath38128 on a 3d grid .",
    "next , we perform a fourier transform .",
    "then , we process this field in the frequency domain to satisfy the desired power law distribution ( @xmath39 ) . finally , we perform an inverse fourier transformation and normalize the generated field to fulfill the desired variance , which is related to the velocity dispersion .",
    "we use hydrodynamic simulations to explore the effects of density / velocity correlations .",
    "we use the orion adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code to perform simulations of turbulent star - forming molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the simulations use periodic boundary conditions and are meant to represent a piece of a typical low - mass star forming cloud similar to taurus .",
    "the numerical methods we use are similar to previous calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we briefly describe the simulations here and refer the reader to these papers for additional details .",
    "we compare the observations with snapshots from two simulations , each with different turbulent properties ( see table [ simprop ] ) .",
    "both simulations have a domain size of 10 pc , contain @xmath40 , and have an initial gas temperature of 10 k. simulation rt has a turbulent velocity dispersion of 1.52 km s@xmath41 , such that it satisfies the observed linewidth - size relation at 10 pc , @xmath42 km s@xmath41 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rt1 and rt2 correspond to two different output times for the rt simulation .",
    "they have ages of 0.65 myr and 1.03 myr , respectively .",
    "the turbulence is initialized by adding random velocity perturbations with an input power spectrum @xmath43 for input wave numbers in the range @xmath44 .",
    "simulation hd has a velocity dispersion of 1.06 km s@xmath41 and the turbulent perturbations have @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the latter turbulent perturbations are generated in the same way as those used in section  [ subsec : random_cores ] . to achieve a turbulent steady - state , in which the power - spectrum and density distribution function are constant in time , we inject the perturbations for two domain crossing times without self - gravity .    after turning on gravity , we continue injecting energy so that the velocity dispersion remains constant . without continuous energy injection ,",
    "the turbulence would decay as a result of dissipation in shocks over a crossing time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once collapse begins , refinement is added to ensure that the jeans criterion is satisfied for a jeans number of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we insert sink particles when the density exceeds the jeans resolution on the maximum amr level @xcite .",
    "hd adopts an isothermal equation of state , while rt solves the radiative transfer equation in the flux limited diffusion approximation ; it also includes radiative feedback from the forming stars @xcite .",
    "this heating , which is generally limited to regions near sink particles , has minimal impact on the turbulent properties .",
    "rt and hd have @xmath48 and @xmath49 base grids with 2 and 4 amr levels of refinement , respectively . here",
    ", we only use the data on the base grid , which is comparable to the observational pixel resolution , to produce the synthetic observations ( see below ) .",
    "figure [ powersim ] shows the velocity energy spectra for the three snapshots . for low wave numbers ( @xmath50 ) the energy spectrum is flatter than @xmath51 .",
    "it steepens above @xmath52 where dissipation occurs .",
    "the dissipation scale is set by the numerical grid size and typically occurs on a scale of a few grid cells ."
