    "the observed range of fwhm for the broad emission lines in agn could be driven by various mechanisms .",
    "an obvious possibility is the luminosity of the central source .",
    "however plots of line width against luminosity for observed samples show no clear correlation between these parameters",
    ". it would be natural to expect higher luminosity sources to have higher velocities in the emission regions and thus broader lines , but powerful sources such as 3c273 can have narrower lines than humbler seyfert galaxies . in the context of ` unified models ' it is natural to associate this parameter with viewing angle to an axially - symmetric system . in the case of radio - loud sources",
    "there is clear evidence of a relation between the radio core to lobe dominance parameter , r , and fwhm ( wills & browne 1986 ) .",
    "the lack of spherical symmetry has been modelled in various ways including a simple kepler disc , an axisymmetric broad line cloud distribution , and a spherical cloud distribution with non spherical illumination by the central source .",
    "the ` unified model ' may involve a preferred axis of illumination along the axis of symmetry , extending the observed illumination cones of the enlr into the blr .",
    "thus , we develop a relation for fwhm dependent on both viewing angle and luminosity .",
    "we shall proceed initially in as model - independent a way as possible .",
    "later we shall return to the possibility that we can use the results to discriminate between models .",
    "since we can not measure the angle of inclination of the nuclear regions , at least with any certainty , we resort to statistical considerations . if the line width is a function of angle and luminosity then averaging over angle and convolving with the luminosity function will give a line width distribution which can in principle be compared to observations . while the data are not sufficiently extensive to provide a strong test there are several surveys available to validate the general approach .",
    "our simplest description of the line width dependence contains three parameters which the line width differences in a given source imply are wavelength dependent .",
    "however , we can constrain the models further in several ways .",
    "we know that the equivalent width of a line is related to luminosity ; this is the baldwin relation . since the slope of the ew ",
    "luminosity relation in a single time - variable nucleus is generally different from the slope of the baldwin relation this will show some scatter . however , this is small compared to the scatter in the ew  fwhm diagram . ignoring the scatter in the baldwin relation",
    "we show that the part of the ew ",
    "fwhm plot that is populated by sources coincides with that to be expected on the basis of the angle dependence of the fwhm ",
    "luminosity relation .    in the context of a unified model with an obscuring torus",
    "we would also expect the x - ray continuum slope to be dependent upon viewing angle .",
    "this is because the obscuring material preferentially absorbs soft x - rays giving a harder spectrum in sources viewed edge - on .",
    "we construct a similar angle - dependent functional form for the dependence of x - ray slope on angle and luminosity and show that this is consistent with the observed distribution of slopes .",
    "we illustrate two applications .",
    "first as a diagnostic tool we show that both the dual winds model ( cassidy & raine 1996 ) and the disc wind model ( chiang & murray 1996 ) have an angular dependence of line width consistent with the observed line width distribution function but that a keplerian disc does not .",
    "the extreme form of the model in which line widths depend on angle only and not on luminosity is ruled out .",
    "the line width dependence for the magnetic winds model as shown in figure 6 of emmering et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is not consistent with this model .",
    "we have not considered the luminosity dependence of line width in these models but this might provide a more discriminating diagnostic .    finally we show the preliminary results , but not the details , of a cosmological application to determine the deceleration parameter @xmath0 ( in principle , given enough data ) .",
    "we restrict attention to an axisymmetric blr , so ignoring , for example , warped discs .",
    "line width , @xmath1 , taken to be a function of viewing angle , @xmath2 , and luminosity , @xmath3 , can be written in general as a double series of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is measured from the axis of symmetry , @xmath6 is the luminosity in units of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameters ( independent of @xmath3 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "we use only the cosine series to impose symmetry about the equatorial plane .",
    "our model dependence enters only through    \\(i ) the assumption that we can truncate this series , retaining only the terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus equation ( [ equn1 ] ) simplifies to    @xmath14    with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 constant for a given line .",
    "\\(ii ) we assume also a maximum value for inclination @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to the opening angle of the torus in the unified model .",
    "we find that best fits are obtained for @xmath19 which , while larger than many estimates of the opening angle , is consistent with more recent observations and also the dual winds model ( cassidy & raine 1996 ) . for values of @xmath20",
    "we assume systems are randomly oriented .",
    "we obtain a line width distribution by averaging over angle and luminosity .",
    "initially for modelling the line width distribution we use a 2 power - law fit to the b - band luminosity function of boyle et al .",
    "( 1988 ) @xmath21 however , for later work on the x - ray spectral index and cosmology , we will use the x - ray luminosity function of boyle et al.(1994 ) .",
    "the line width distributions can be fitted equally well with the x - ray luminosity function using different values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 which is consistent with predictions that @xmath22 for some value of @xmath23 .",
    "the number of systems with line widths between @xmath1 and @xmath24d@xmath1 is @xmath25d@xmath1 and is given by @xmath26 this integral is evaluated numerically .",
    "figure [ c4lwd ] shows the results for civ@xmath27 compared to observational samples ( wilkes 1987 , wills et al .",
    "1993 and brotherton et al.1994 ) .",
    "the wilkes data is taken from the parkes flat spectrum survey which is biased towards face - on objects .",
    "thus we expect the peak in the distribution for this sample to lie to the low velocity side of the model .",
    "the values of @xmath15 ( the spherical component of velocity ) and @xmath16 ( essentially the dipole component ) are @xmath28 km s@xmath8 and @xmath29 km s@xmath8 with @xmath30 .",
    "we have also obtained fits for mgii@xmath31 and h@xmath23 using data from the rixos sample ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1997 ) . because the data is biased it is difficult to assess the agreement with the model statistically , but it seems highly likely that a pure disc model , ( @xmath32 ) which would predict a large number of narrow lined systems , and a spherical model ( @xmath33 ) , which would give a narrow peaked distribution , are ruled out .",
    "rudge and raine ( 1998 ) showed that the angle dependence of line widths in both the disc winds model of cassidy & raine ( 1996 ) and the disc wind model of chiang and murray ( 1996 ) can be fitted to the form ( [ vel ] ) .",
    "the baldwin relation for the line equivalent width , @xmath34 , is @xmath35 where for these lines @xmath36 ( peterson , 1997 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( puchnarewicz , unpublished ) .",
    "we have @xmath39 with a large scatter from the angular dependence .",
    "we therefore predict that @xmath40 with a large scatter . we construct a @xmath41 plot for systems drawn at random from a population given by the luminosity function ( equation [ lumfun ] ) and uniformly distributed in angle in the range @xmath42 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ wew ] ( see figure 7 of wills et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for comparison with observations ) .",
    "we would expect the time dependence of the baldwin relation ( and possibly a gradual rather than a sudden cut - off near @xmath43 ) to smooth out the upper edge of the predicted distribution .",
    "the predicted slope of the upper boundary is @xmath44 compared with @xmath45 from inspection of wills et al .",
    "similar plots can be obtained for mgii and h@xmath46 with slopes 1.1 and 1.3 respectively , compared with @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( puchnarewicz , unpublished ) .",
    "we now apply a similar idea to the slope , @xmath49 , of the x - ray spectra .",
    "the analytical form we choose is motivated by the following argument .",
    "assume that the hard x - ray luminosity @xmath50 at @xmath51 is independent of angle and the soft component @xmath52 centered on @xmath53 has the form ( [ vel ] ) .",
    "then @xmath54 \\label{alphax}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath55 to accommodate softer spectra in face - on systems ) . as above",
    "we can derive the corresponding @xmath49 distribution by integrating over the luminosity distribution and angle . in figure 4",
    "we show the theoretical curve for @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 , overlaid on the spectral index distribution for the rixos ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1997 ) , emss ( ciliegi & maccacaro 1996 ) and wandel & boller ( 1998 ) objects .",
    "it can be seen that the wandel & boller objects are not fitted by the model curve .",
    "this is due to the sample having a large number of nls1 s which have in general a softer x - ray spectrum . combining equations ( [ vel ] ) and ( [ alphax ] ) we obtain an expression for line width dependent upon spectral index and luminosity",
    "this obviously predicts that face - on sources with narrower lines also have softer x - ray spectra , as is shown in wandel & boller ( 1998 ) .",
    "however their spherically symmetric blr , which models this relation , does not reproduce the observed line width distribution ( rudge & raine in prep . ) .",
    "since the analysis enables us to account for the scatter in the fwhm - luminosity relation for agn it should be possible in principle to use the model as a cosmological test . to indicate the results that might be expected we show the difference in evolution of @xmath25 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , ( @xmath63 km s@xmath8mpc@xmath8 )",
    "of course , for practical application the test requires a large sample of line widths at high redshift .",
