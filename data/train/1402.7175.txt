    "magnetic memory devices are based on the presence of microscopic magnetic domains where the alignment , or more precisely the alternation of alignments , of the magnetization encodes the physical information .",
    "while in classical hard discs , these domains are directly switched by a magnetic field , it is energetically far more efficient to push them through a wire by an electrical current@xcite .",
    "the central feature of this current - induced domain wall ( dw ) motion can be rationalized within the picture of the standard @xmath0-model of the localized electrons which form the local magnetic moments and the itinerant electrons injected into the @xmath1-band whose spins are polarized from outside in external contacts @xcite .",
    "then , the local exchange interaction of the itinerant electron spins with the local magnetic moments generates a current - induced spin - transfer torque ( stt ) .",
    "two basic contributions of the stt are well known in materials without a breaking of the symmetry in the subsystem of the itinerant electrons@xcite .",
    "the adiabatic stt stems from the adiabatic alignment of the itinerant spins and the local magnetic moments , resulting in a dw motion due to the conservation of the total spin .",
    "moreover , the nonadiabatic stt arises , which is also known as the @xmath2-term .",
    "it has its origin in a lag of the dynamics of the polarization of the itinerant electrons behind the dynamics of the local magnetic texture .",
    "this back - action of the local magnetic moments on the itinerant spins induces a relaxation dynamics for the latter during which an additional nonadiabatic current - induced stt is generated .",
    "even though the non - adiabatic stt can lead to a considerable increase of the dw velocity with respect to the adiabatic motion , a very fast movement of the dw is limited by the walker breakdown ( wb ) at a critical current density , which is accompanied by a precession of the magnetization@xcite at the dw center .",
    "however , this precession can be suppressed in systems with a broken symmetry where a distinct direction of the magnetization or the electron spin is favored over the others .",
    "this may also imply a preference for a distinct chirality , or handedness , of the dw .",
    "based on this observation , miron _ _ et al.__@xcite have proposed to use the rashba effect as a stabilizer of the dw chirality and the corresponding suppression of the wb and an increase of the dw velocity have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is similar to the action of a transverse magnetic field .",
    "in addition , other mechanisms to break the symmetry , such as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , are supposed to enhance the dw motion due to a preferred handedness@xcite .",
    "hence , by modifying the thickness of layers of distinct materials , the strength of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , and with it , the preferred chirality , can even be adjusted within certain limits@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to reveal how a rashba spin - orbit interaction of the itinerant electron spins acts on the chirality and the dynamics of a dw .",
    "we thereby consider the stabilization or destabilization of a distinct chirality in certain parameter regimes and their impact on the dw velocity . to illustrate the basic physical mechanism at work , we use a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model which allows us to calculate the full stt including the rashba - induced effective field in simple terms .",
    "by eventually solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation of motion of the dw and hereby calculating dw velocities for opposite chiralities , we identify several regimes of chirality - dependent dw motion .",
    "this actually includes a regime , where wb is suppressed and shifted to larger current densities , but also a current - dependent switching to the desired chirality .",
    "we show that the optimal chirality can be chosen by the direction of the applied current flow .",
    "results are presented in a broad parameter range of the current density , the strength of the rashba interaction and the lengths of the applied current pulse . particularly for short current pulses ,",
    "we find that the the average dw velocity may differ strongly from the steady current value .",
    "we consider a 1d quantum wire in which a dw is formed by localized magnetic moments @xmath3 described by a unit vector @xmath4 and its saturation magnetization @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics of these classical moments is well described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation of motion @xcite .",
    "it describes the precessional motion of the moments which can be either induced by external global magnetic fields or local interactions .",
    "this precession is damped by the gilbert damping term which lets the moments to actually align towards the ( local or global ) magnetic field . in our case",
    "the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xmath6 includes an effective field @xmath7 , the gyro - magnetic ratio @xmath8 , the gilbert damping constant @xmath9 and a spin torque @xmath10 which is provided by external means and which is in the focus of the present work . in this work , spin transfer torque ( stt )",
    "@xmath10 has its origin in a spin polarized current which interacts with the magnetic moments via the exchange interaction .",
    "the actual shape of the dw is created by an effective magnetic field which represents the interactions between the magnetic moments .",
    "we use the standard continuum form@xcite @xmath11 here , the interaction ( ia ) strength @xmath12 stems from the mutual exchange interaction among the spins with the strength @xmath13 and is a measure for the tendency of the magnetic moments to align parallel to each other . moreover , the easy - axis anisotropy @xmath14 and the hard axis anisotropy @xmath15 are the energies of the favorable and unfavorable directions for these moments , respectively .",
    "the explicit directions of these axes ( e.g. , the @xmath16 or @xmath17 direction ) have to be defined according to the situation under consideration and different constellations arise .",
    "even though the choice of the hard and the easy axis is hardly of any importance in highly symmetric systems , it becomes relevant if the symmetry is broken .",
    "since this is the case for systems with a rashba spin - orbit interaction in the focus here , we will consider different setups in this work .",
    "a major point in this work is the calculation of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq::llg ] ) in presence of a rashba spin - orbit interaction and a nonadiabatic relaxation channel for the itinerant electron spins . to do this",

    "those are assumed to be non - interacting and are described by the kinetic hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "the two species couple via the exchange or the @xmath0-interaction which gives rise to the hamiltonian @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , we add to this minimal 1d model the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xmath22 for the itinerant electron spins in the spin polarized electron current which is imprinted at the ends of the quantum wire ( see below ) .",
    "since we are interested in nonadiabatic effects , we include a relaxational part @xmath23 for the itinerant electrons . in total , this yields the hamiltonian @xmath24    ( color online ) ( a ) schematic view on the linearization of the original electron dispersion ( dashed ) to two branches of left / right moving particles ( full lines ) in the vicinity of the fermi energy and the fermi wave vector @xmath25 .",

    "we concentrate on the low energy sector of the electronic system .",
    "this means that we only focus on excitations in the vicinity of the fermi level .",

    "[ fig::scheme]a ) .",
    "these branches can be associated to left and right moving electrons in the 1d wire .",

    "all remaining parts of the total hamiltonian ( [ eq::totham ] ) can also be expressed in terms of the @xmath37 .",

    "this should also lead to major chirality - dependent velocity differences since the oscillation amplitudes may differ for both chiralities [ cf .",
    "[ fig::v_t](c ) ] .",
    "second , the dw does not immediately stop after the end of the current pulse , but `` drifts '' a certain distance either in forward or backward direction@xcite .",
    "the direction of the drift is determined by the momentary state of the dw at the end of the pulse .",
    "as there are no spin torques any more acting after the pulse ( neither any rashba fields nor the conventional ( non-)adiabatic torques are present ) , the dw strives to settle at its equilibrium position which is determined by the hard axis anisotropy .",
    "if the dw is tilted out of this position at the end of the pulse , it realigns in the fastest manner back to it and thereby moves some distance .    not only the pulse length @xmath165 determines the state of the dw at the end of the pulse , but also the current density . for a constant @xmath165 ,",
    "an increasing @xmath80 leads to a smaller oscillation period as it is shown in fig . [ fig::v_vs_t_pulse ]",
    "thus the state at the end of the pulse , and with it the drift , is changed .    to see the effects of the short - time averaging and the drifting , we define two different averaged velocities .",
    "first , the averaged velocity during the pulse is @xmath166 , and , second , an effective averaged velocity @xmath167 is meaningful .",
    "the second quantity includes the drifting since we use the dw position @xmath168 after a long enough time .",
    "as it is difficult to decide at which time the dw actually stops , we also divide this position by the pulse length @xmath165 .",

    "we find smooth oscillations of the average velocity @xmath172 , i.e. , without drifting .",
    "they occur because the oscillatory motion of the dw does not completely average out even for large current densities .",
    "for very short pulses , remarkably large velocities appear for a dw with negative chirality which can be traced back to the large velocities at the beginning of the motion for this chirality in systems with a hard @xmath104 axis [ cf .",

    "[ fig::v_vs_pulse ] ( c ) ] .",
    "thus , large velocity differences between the two cases of opposite initial chiralities at small @xmath165 are expected .",
    "figure [ fig::diffv_vs_pulse ] indeed confirms this .",
    "in addition to the large absolute velocity differences at small @xmath165 , these differences also vary very strongly and can actually change the sign and with that the motional direction of the dw .",
    "these results illustrate the important role of the additional short - time effects for the dw dynamics , in particular in the presence of a rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "its impact on specific experiments may also be affected by additional phenomena not considered in this work , such as the presence of pinning centers@xcite , for instance .",
    "we have studied the influence of the direction of the hard axis and the dw chirality on the dw s current induced dynamics in 1d rashba wires .",
    "the spin transfer torque arises from a gradient expansion in the dw steepness and enters in the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation which we solve numerically .",
    "two different relaxation states were used which either generate or suppress the rashba anti - damping field - like torque @xmath125 .",
    "this is perpendicular to the regular rashba - induced field - like torque @xmath105 , which arises in both cases .",
    "as we focus on the case when the nonadiabaticity parameter @xmath174 , a walker breakdown at sufficiently strong current densities @xmath80 arises .",
    "it is suppressed by the rashba field @xmath105 , since it acts as an additional local anisotropy . for rather strong rashba couplings",
    "@xmath123 , the wb is entirely suppressed .",
    "even more interestingly , we identify a third `` phase '' in the @xmath145 parameter space : for intermediate current densities and/or large @xmath123 , we find a single switching of the initial chirality to a preferred chirality , which can be chosen by the direction of the current flow .",
    "moreover , the effects of the chirality switching appear to be more pronounced at short times and we have considered short current pulses . as expected , we find a stronger influence of the momentary velocity state when a short - time averaging procedure is applied .",
    "further phenomena such as a drifting of the dw after a short current pulse affect the short - time dynamics of a dw even more pronounced .",
    "this results partly in rather abrupt changes of the effective dw velocity and a completely different dependence on the current density as compared to the steady current arises .",
    "then , even larger velocity differences between dws of different chiralities result .",
    "this rich set of features shows that several possibilities arise for optimal parameter combinations in order to achieve a maximal dw velocity .",
