    "the analysis of nonlinear models on regular lattices @xcite , as well as the investigation of linear models on inhomogeneous and fractal networks @xcite has attracted a great deal of attention in the last decades : while nonlinearity dramatically modifies the dynamics , allowing for soliton propagation , energy localization , and the existence of discrete breathers @xcite , topology mainly affects the energy spectrum giving rise to interesting phenomena such as anomalous diffusion , localized states , and fracton dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is now both timely and highly desirable to begin a thorough investigation of nonlinear models on general inhomogeneous networks , since one expects not only interesting new phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and topology , but also an high potential impact for applications to biology @xcite and to signal propagation in optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of uniformity break on soliton propagation @xcite and localized modes @xcite has been investigated by considering @xmath0-junctions @xcite ( consisting of a long chain inserted on a site of a chain yielding a star - like geometry ) or geometries like junctions of two infinite waveguides or the waveguide coupler @xcite . here , we consider general finite networks inserted on a chain .",
    "the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) is a paradigmatic example of a nonlinear equation on a lattice which has been successfully applied to several contexts @xcite : in particular , it has been used to describe the physics of arrays of coupled optical waveguides @xcite and arrays of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , on a homogeneous chain , the dnlse is not integrable @xcite ; nevertheless , soliton - like wavepackets can propagate for a long time and the stability conditions of soliton - like solutions can be derived within variational approaches @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of traveling pulses has been investigated in detail in literature @xcite ( more references are in @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest example of an inhomogeneous chain is provided by an external potential localized on a site of the chain @xcite : an experimental set up with a single defect has been recently realized with coupled optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "another relevant example of an inhomogeneous chain is obtained adding an additional fano degree of freedom coupled to the a site of the chain , which gives the so - called fano - anderson model ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    as a first step in the investigation of the properties of nonlinear models on general inhomogeneous networks",
    ", we shall analyze the propagation of dnlse solitons on a class of inhomogeneous networks built by suitably adding a finite topological inhomogeneity to an unbranched chain . the general framework where this analysis can be carried out",
    "is provided by graph theory @xcite ; in particular , we shall consider networks where a finite discrete graph @xmath1 is attached by a link to a site of the homogeneous , unbranched chain ( see fig.1 ) while all the sites potentials @xmath2 are set to a constant .",
    "such systems may be experimentally realized by placing the nonlinear waveguides in a suitable inhomogeneous arrangement , like the one depicted in fig.1 .",
    "we mention that in arrays of bose - einstein condensates one can build up geometries , which differ from the unbranched chain , by properly superimposing the laser beams creating the optical lattices @xcite . in superconducting josephson arrays @xcite ,",
    "present - day technologies allow for to prepare the insulating support for the junctions in order to create structures of the form `` chain + a topological defect '' . in the context of coupled nonlinear waveguides",
    "@xcite , one should couple the waveguides according the geometry of the graph @xmath1 , and couple this network of waveguides to a single waveguide of the unbranched chain ; a similar engineering should be requested to realize photonic crystal circuits @xcite obtained merging the circuit @xmath1 to the unbranched chain .",
    "as we shall discuss in section iv , the shape of the attached graph @xmath1 affects the transmission and reflection coefficients as a function of the soliton momentum : as an example of this general phenomenon , we consider unbranched chains to which simple graphs , like finite chains and cayley trees , are added .",
    "our analysis points to the fact that the topology of the network ( i.e. , how its sites are connected ) controls the transmission properties , and that one can modify soliton propagation by varying the topology of the inserted network . in particular , we shall show that the momenta of perfect transmission are determined by the energy levels of the inserted graph , i.e. , by the eigenfrequencies of the @xmath1 s oscillation modes in the linear case ( see section iv ) .    on a chain",
    ", stable solitonic wavepackets can propagate for long times @xcite .",
    "when a graph @xmath1 is inserted , one can study how the presence of this topological inhomogeneity modifies the soliton propagation .",
    "we numerically evaluate the transmission coefficients and we compare the numerical results with analytical findings obtained for a relevant soliton class , to which we refer as _ large - fast solitons_. for large fast solitons the transmission coefficients can be evaluated within a linear approximation @xcite .",
    "indeed the characteristic time for the soliton - topological defect collision are very small with respect to the soliton dispersion time ; therefore , the soliton scattering can be approximated by the scattering of a plane - wave . however , as we numerically checked in the figs.2 - 6 , the nonlinearity still plays a role , giving long - lived solitons , especially near the momenta of perfect reflection or perfect transmission : it keeps the soliton shape during its propagation .",
    "since in many experimental settings one can easily check if the reflected wavepacket is vanishing , this work could provide a basis for a topological engineering of solitonic propagation on inhomogeneous networks .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we review the properties of the dnlse on a chain and we introduce the variational approach to investigate the soliton dynamics . in section iii , by using graph theory @xcite , we define the dnlse on inhomogeneous networks built by adding a topological perturbation to an unbranched chain ; furthermore , we explain the numerical techniques used in the paper for the study of the soliton scattering , and we discuss the range of validity of the linear approximation used in the analytical computations . in section iv we present our analysis yielding the conditions on the spectrum of the finite graph @xmath1 in order to obtain total reflection and transmission of solitons . in section",
    "v we study the relevant case when @xmath1 is a finite , linear chain and we show that the fano - anderson model @xcite can be realized within our approach by considering a single link attached to the unbranched chain . in section",
    "vi we show that , for self - similar graphs @xmath1 , the values of momenta for which perfect reflection occurs becomes perfect transmission momenta when the next generation of the graph is considered and we study in detail the case of cayley trees as an example of self - similar structures . in section vii",
    "we study the transmission coefficients for three different inserted finite graphs : loops , stars and complete graphs .",
    "finally , section viii is devoted to our concluding remarks .",
    "besides its theoretical interest , the dnlse describes the properties of interesting systems , such as arrays of coupled optical waveguides and arrays of bose - einstein condensates . on a chain",
    "the dnlse reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an integer index denoting the site position and the normalization condition is @xmath5 . in eq.([dnls - retta ] ) one has a kinetic coupling term only between nearest - neighbour sites , but the effect of next- nearest - neighbour coupling and long - term coupling has been also often considered ( see the reviews @xcite for more references ) : in the present paper we consider only a constant nearest - neighbour interaction , but from the next section we allow for that the number of nearest - neighbours of a site is not constant across the network ( like for the simple chain ) , but it can vary according the topology of the graph .    in condensate arrays , @xmath6 is the wavefunction of the condensate in the @xmath4th well .",
    "time @xmath7 is in units of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the tunneling rate between neighbouring condensates ; @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an external on - site field superimposed to the optical lattice and the nonlinear coefficient is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is due to the interatomic interaction and it is proportional to the scattering length ( @xmath13 is positive for @xmath14 atoms and is negative for @xmath15 atoms ) .    in arrays of one - dimensional coupled optical waveguides",
    "@xcite @xmath6 is the electric field in the @xmath4th - waveguide at the position @xmath7 and the dnlse describes the spatial evolution of the field .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is proportional to the kerr nonlinearity and the on - site potentials @xmath17 are the effective refraction indices of the individual waveguides .",
    "as the light propagates along the array , the coupling induces an exchange of power among the single waveguides . in the low power limit ( i.e. when the nonlinearity is negligible ) , the optical field spreads over the whole array . upon increasing the power ,",
    "the output field narrows until it is localized in a few waveguides , and discrete solitons can finally be observed @xcite .",
    "experiments with defects ( i.e. , with particular waveguides different from the others ) have been already reported @xcite .    on a chain",
    "dnlse soliton - like wavepackets can propagate for a long time even if the equation is not integrable @xcite . let us consider , at @xmath18 , a gaussian wavepacket centered in @xmath19 , with initial momentum @xmath20 and width @xmath21 : its time dynamics are studied resorting to the dirac time - dependent variational approach @xcite which well reproduces the exact results in the continuum theory @xcite . in its discrete version",
    "the wavefunction can be written as a generalized gaussian @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the center and the width of the density @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the momenta conjugate to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ; @xmath28 is just a normalization factor .",
    "the wave packet dynamical evolution is obtained from the lagrangian @xmath29 , with the equations of motion for the variational parameters @xmath30 . in the absence of external potential ( @xmath31 ) , one obtains the lagrangian @xcite @xmath32 } -   \\frac{\\lambda { \\cal k}^2}{2 } \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty }   e^ { - 4 ( n-\\xi)^2 / \\gamma^2}\\ ] ] @xmath33 with @xmath34 not too small ( @xmath35 ) , we can replace the sums over @xmath4 with integrals : to evaluate the error committed , we recall that @xcite @xmath36 in this limit the normalization factor becomes @xmath37 .",
    "we finally get @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath40 @xmath41 is conserved .",
    "notice that , due to the discreteness , the group velocity can not be arbitrarily large ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "as eq.([knuth ] ) clearly shows , the variational equations of motions ( [ var4 ] ) are meaningful only for large solitons : the peierls - nabarro potential does not appear in ( [ var4 ] ) , and the equations feature momentum conservation .",
    "we mention that in uniform dnlse chains a threshold condition for the soliton propagation appears : only if the soliton is sufficiently broad solitons may freely move @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall consider only large - fast solitons , so that the variational equations of motions ( [ var4 ] ) are appropriate ; however , to study the propagation of localized discrete breathers in inhomogeneous networks one should study the lagrangian ( [ lag - n - finito ] ) .",
    "when @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the shape of the wavefunction does not vary and one has a variational soliton - like solution where the center of mass move with a constant velocity @xmath45 . if @xmath46 the conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be satisfied only if @xmath47 ( i.e. , only when the effective mass is negative ) : for this reason in the following we take only momenta @xmath48 ( positive velocities ) or @xmath49 ( negative velocities ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath50 and large enough solitons ( @xmath51 ) , the condition on @xmath16 allowing for a soliton solution is @xcite @xmath52    the stability of variational solutions has been numerically checked showing that the shape of the solitons is preserved for long times . in the following ,",
    "we use the term `` solitons '' to name the solutions of the variational equations ( [ var1])-([var4 ] ) .",
    "one can have a similar criterion using other variational approaches @xcite .",
    "one also expects that the integrable version of the dnlse , the so - called ablowitz - ladik equation @xcite , provides results very similar to those obtained in this paper .",
    "the dnlse ( [ dnls - retta ] ) can be generalized to a general discrete network by means of graph theory .",
    "a graph @xmath53 is given by a set of sites @xmath54 connected pairwise by set of unoriented links @xmath55 defining a neighbouring relation between the sites .",
    "the topology of a graph is described by its adjacency matrix @xmath56 which is defined to be @xmath57 if @xmath54 and @xmath58 are nearest - neighbours , and @xmath59 otherwise .",
    "the dnlse on a graph reads as @xmath60    equation ( [ dnls - gen ] ) describes the wavefunction dynamics in a wide range of discrete physical systems , and it can be applied to regular lattices as well as to inhomogeneous networks such as fractals , complex biological structures and glasses .",
    "the properties of eq.([dnls - gen ] ) on small graphs has been investigated in @xcite . the first term in the right - hand side of eq.([dnls - gen ] )",
    "represents the hopping between nearest - neighbours ( with tunneling rate proportional to @xmath56 ) , the second is the nonlinear term , and the third one describes superimposed external potentials .",
    "we remark that in eq.([dnls - gen ] ) the numbers of nearest neighbours is site - dependent .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath61 if @xmath54 and @xmath58 are nearest - neighbours , one is assuming that the tunneling rate between neighbouring sites entering eq.([dnls - gen ] ) is constant across the array and it is ( in the chosen units ) equal to @xmath57 .",
    "below , we shall consider also the case of a tunneling rate which is not constant across the array .",
    "we shall focus on the situation where the graph @xmath53 is obtained by attaching a finite graph @xmath1 to a single site of the unbranched chain ( see fig.1 ) and setting @xmath62 for all the sites .",
    "we denote the sites of the unbranched chain and of the graph @xmath1 with latin indices @xmath63 and greek indices @xmath64 respectively .",
    "a single link connects the site @xmath65 of the chain with the site @xmath66 of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "the scattering of a soliton through the topological perturbation can be numerically studied as follows . at @xmath18 ( hereafter , we refer to @xmath7 as a time even if for the optical waveguides it represents a spatial variable ) one prepares a gaussian soliton ( [ gaussol ] ) centered well to the left of @xmath59 ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) moving towards @xmath65 ( @xmath68 ) with a width related to the nonlinear coefficient according to eq.([lambda_sol ] ) . from eq.([dnls - gen ] ) the time evolution of the wavefunction may be numerically evaluated : when @xmath69 the soliton scatters through the finite graph @xmath1 ( @xmath70 being the group velocity of the soliton ) . at a time",
    "@xmath7 well after the soliton scattering ( i.e. @xmath71 ) , the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by @xmath74 @xmath75    note that , while in the linear case ( @xmath76 ) one has @xmath77 , in general , nonlinearity violates unitarity by allowing for phenomena such as soliton trapping ; nevertheless , there are regimes where soliton trapping is negligible and @xmath78 .",
    "we numerically checked that in the time dynamics reported in the paper this condition is well satisfied .",
    "situations corresponding to resonant scattering ( i.e. @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) have a particular relevance : in fact , these situations can be easily experimentally detected , and the soliton - like solution is stable also well after the scattering , as it is numerically verified in different examples of resonant reflection and transmission .    for an important class of soliton solutions ( to which we refer as large - fast solitons ) the scattering through a topological inhomogeneity can be analytically studied using a linear approximation .",
    "the interaction between the soliton and the topological inhomogeneity is characterized by two time - scales : the time of the soliton - defect interaction @xmath81 and the soliton dispersion time ( i.e. the time scale in which the wavepacket will spread in absence of interaction ) @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "for _ large _",
    "( @xmath35 , as in many relevant experimental settings ) and _ fast _ solitons , i.e. @xmath83 one has that the soliton may be considered as a set of non interacting plane waves while experiencing scattering on the graph ; thus the soliton transmission may be studied by considering , in the linear regime ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , the transport coefficients of a plane wave across the topological defect .",
    "the use of the linear approximation for the analysis of the interaction of a fast soliton with a local defect in the continuous nonlinear schrdinger equation is reported in @xcite .",
    "later , we shall compare the analytical findings with a numerical solution of eq.([dnls - gen ] ) , namely with the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 given by eqs.([r])-([t ] ) .",
    "in this section we show that , if a large - fast soliton scatters through a topological perturbation of an unbranched chain , the soliton momenta for perfect reflection and transmission are completely determined by the spectral properties of the attached graph @xmath1 : in particular one has @xmath84 if @xmath85 coincides with an energy level of @xmath1 , while @xmath86 if @xmath85 is an energy level of the reduced graph @xmath87 , i.e. , of the graph obtained from @xmath1 by cutting the site @xmath66 from @xmath1 ( see fig.1 ) . in algebraic graph theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) the energy level of a graph is simply defined as an eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix .",
    "we will call @xmath88 and @xmath89 the adjacency matrices of @xmath1 and @xmath87 , respectively .    for large - fast solitons ,",
    "the pertinent eigenvalue equation to investigate is @xmath90 ( here @xmath54 is a generic site of the network ) .",
    "the solution corresponding to a plane wave coming from the left of the chain is @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 .",
    "the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath96 and the transmission coefficient by @xmath97 .",
    "the continuity at @xmath59 requires @xmath98 .",
    "the equation in @xmath59 is @xmath99 while in @xmath66 one has @xmath100 at the sites @xmath101 of @xmath87 one obtains @xmath102    for perfect reflection , i.e. for the momenta @xmath20 s such that @xmath103 , one has @xmath104 , @xmath105 and from eq.([eq_0 ] ) @xmath106 .",
    "therefore eqs.([eq_alpha ] ) and ( [ eq_altri ] ) reduce to the eigenvalue equation for the adjacency matrix @xmath88 and , apart from the trivial case @xmath107 , they are satisfied only if @xmath108 coincides with an eigenvalue of @xmath109 .    at variance , in order to find the momenta @xmath20 s such that @xmath110 ( perfect transmission ) , one has @xmath111 , @xmath112 and from eq.([eq_0 ] ) @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , eqs.([eq_altri ] ) reduces to the eigenvalue equation for @xmath89 and it is satisfied only if @xmath108 coincides with an eigenvalue of @xmath89 .",
    "this general argument can be easily extended to the situation where @xmath114 identical graphs @xmath1 are attached to @xmath65 : indeed , now one has only to replace in eq .",
    "( [ eq_0 ] ) @xmath115 with @xmath116 and the conditions for @xmath110 and @xmath103 do not change .",
    "the stated result holds for the case where the tunneling rates between the neighbour sites of @xmath1 are constant ( and equal to 1 in the chosen units ) : however one can also consider in @xmath1 non - uniform tunneling rates @xmath117 , where @xmath101 and @xmath118 are nearest - neighbour sites belonging to @xmath1 ( @xmath119 if @xmath120 ) .",
    "the dnlse at a site @xmath101 of @xmath1 becomes @xmath121 while the dnlse at the sites @xmath4 of the of the chain remain unchanged .",
    "now , the criterion states that @xmath84 if @xmath108 coincides with an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath122 , while @xmath86 if @xmath108 is an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath123 defined as @xmath124 if @xmath101 and @xmath118 belong to the reduced graph @xmath87 .",
    "as a first simple application of the argument given in section iv , we consider a single site @xmath66 attached via a single link to the site @xmath59 of the unbranched chain . for bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices",
    "@xcite the setup `` infinite chain + single link '' or `` infinite chain + finite chain '' may be realized by using two pairs of counterpropagating laser beams to create a star - shaped geometry in the @xmath125-@xmath126 plan @xcite and manipulating the frequencies of the superimposed harmonic magnetic potential so that in the @xmath126 direction only few sites can be occupied . in an optic context , chains of coupled waveguides are routinely built and studied @xcite : one can obtain the configuration `` infinite chain + single link '' by coupling a further waveguide to a waveguide of the chain .",
    "the dnlse in the sites @xmath59 and @xmath66 reads @xmath127 and @xmath128 it is transparent from eqs.([singolo_link_0])-([singolo_link_alpha ] ) that the wavefunction @xmath129 may be interpreted as an additional local fano degree of freedom , yielding the so - called fano - anderson model @xcite . in our approach , such degree of freedom is interpreted as a single link attached to the unbranched chain .",
    "as it is well known , the fano - anderson model describes interesting scattering properties : adding a generic finite graph ( instead of a single link ) gives rise to a yet richer variety of behaviors .",
    "we mention that in @xcite the fano degree of freedom is coupled to several sites of the unbranched chain : this would correspond in our description to a site linked to several sites of the chain , and , in general , to graphs attached to several sites of the chain . for simplicity , in the following we limit ourself to graphs inserted in a single site of the unbranched chain .    for large - fast solitons , when a single link is added to the unbranched chain , the reflection coefficient @xmath72 from eqs.([singolo_link_0])-([singolo_link_alpha ] ) is found to be @xcite @xmath130 in the regime where @xmath131 , we verified that the numerical results of the soliton scattering against the link are in agreement with eq.([r_singolo_link ] ) ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "one sees that , when @xmath20 is approaching @xmath132 ( solitons becoming slower ) , the agreement becomes worse . from the general results ,",
    "there are no fully transmitted momenta and @xmath84 only for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , as one can also see by a direct inspection of ( [ r_singolo_link ] ) .",
    "one can also attach a finite chain of length @xmath135 at the site @xmath59 . in the linear approximation for large - fast solitons ( i.e. , eq.([dls ] ) ) , the solution corresponding to a plane wave coming from the left of the unbranched chain is @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 , while in the attached chain @xmath136 ( @xmath137 denotes the sites of the attached chain , and @xmath138 is the site linked to @xmath65 ) .",

    "for @xmath155 , eq.([r_l_links ] ) reduces to eq.([r_singolo_link ] ) . in agreement with the general argument of section iv , the number of minima and maxima increases with @xmath135 .",
    "eq.([r_l_links ] ) for @xmath156 is compared in fig.2 with the numerical results .",
    "we notice that in the limit @xmath157 the considered problem corresponds to the propagation of a soliton in a the so - called _ star graph _ , which has been recently investigated in the context of two - dimensional networks of nonlinear waveguide arrays @xcite and @xmath0-junctions for matter waves @xcite .",
    "eq.([r_l_links ] ) yields that the values of @xmath20 allowing for perfect reflection ( @xmath84 ) for the length @xmath135 coincide with the momenta of full transmission ( @xmath86 ) when @xmath1 is a chain of length @xmath158 .",
    "this property is readily understood : in fact , if @xmath1 is a chain of length @xmath135 the @xmath20 s for which @xmath84 correspond to the energy levels of @xmath1 . if @xmath1 is a chain of length @xmath158 , the values of @xmath20 s for which @xmath86 correspond to energy levels of the reduced graph @xmath87 , which , in this case , is again given by a chain of length @xmath135 .",

    "complete graphs : _ the complete graph @xmath178 of @xmath179 sites is the graph where every pair of sites in linked @xcite : e.g , @xmath180 is a triangle . inserting @xmath181 at the site @xmath65 of the unbranched chain (",
    "so that @xmath65 is one of the sites of @xmath181 ) , one gets : @xmath182 for @xmath183 , @xmath184 , therefore the complete graph behaves as a single effective defect [ compare with eq.([r_singolo_link ] ) ] .",
    "the comparison between the numerical and analytical results is presented in fig.6 .",
    "as a first step in addressing the issue of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology , we studied the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation on a network built by attaching to a site of an unbranched chain a topological perturbation @xmath1 .",
    "the relevant situation corresponding to the fano - anderson model is obtained when one considers a single link attached to the linear chain .",
    "we showed that , by properly selecting the attached graph , one is able to control the perfect reflection and transmission of traveling solitons .",
    "we derived a general criterion yielding - once the energy levels of the graph @xmath1 is known - the momenta at which the soliton is fully reflected or fully transmitted . for self - similar graphs",
    "@xmath1 , we found that the values of momenta for which perfect reflection occurs become perfect transmission momenta when the next generation of the graph is considered . for finite linear chains , loops , stars and complete graphs , we studied the transmission coefficients and we compared numerical results form the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation with analytical estimates .",
