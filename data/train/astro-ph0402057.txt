    "in a companion paper ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) , the amplitude of the recoil velocity experienced by a binary black hole ( bh ) due to anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation during coalescence is computed . here",
    "we explore some of the consequences of the kicks @xcite : the probability that bhs are ejected from galaxies and the implications for bh growth ; the time scale for a kicked bh to return to the center of a galaxy ; the effect of displacement on nuclear structure ; and other observational signatures of the kicks . unless otherwise indicated , notation is the same as in paper i.    for inspiral from a circular orbit , the kick velocity is a function of the binary mass ratio @xmath0 , the bh spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the initial angle @xmath3 between the spin of the larger bh and the orbital angular momentum of the binary .",
    "following paper i , the spin of the smaller bh is ignored .",
    "although paper i only considers the cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the recoil for arbitrary inclination is likely to be bounded between these extreme values . also , the detailed inclination dependence is unimportant in comparison with the large uncertainty already present in the contribution to the recoil from the final plunge and coalescence .",
    "we will therefore assume that the restriction to equatorial - prograde / retrograde orbits ( @xmath6 $ ] ) considered in paper i encompasses the characteristic range of recoil velocities .",
    "figure 2b of paper i shows upper- and lower - limit estimates of the recoil velocity as a function of the effective spin parameter @xmath7 for reduced mass ratio @xmath8",
    ". the _ upper limit _ for @xmath9 is well fit in the range @xmath10 by the following fifth - order polynomial : @xmath11 fitchett s ( 1983 ) scaling function @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , equals @xmath14 for @xmath9 .",
    "the _ lower limit _ curve of paper i is well fit by @xmath15    we convert these expressions into estimates of the bounds on @xmath16 as follows .",
    "first , as discussed in paper i , there is an ambiguity in how one translates the physical spin parameter @xmath2 of the larger hole into the effective spin parameter @xmath17 of equations ( [ eq : upper ] ) and ( [ eq : lower ] ) .",
    "here we adopt the @xcite relation @xmath18 .",
    "second , fitchett s scaling function assumes that both bodies are non - spinning , and vanishes when @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath20 , significant recoil would occur even for @xmath19 due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we can guess the approximate form of a new scaling function by examining the spin - orbit corrections @xcite to fitchett s recoil formula .",
    "for equatorial orbits , equation ( 4 ) of paper i suggests that @xmath21 should be multiplied by the factor @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the value used in defining @xmath24 and @xmath25 in equations ( [ eq : upper ] ) and ( [ eq : lower ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vplunge ] plots upper and lower limits to @xmath16 as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath26 .",
    "the average over @xmath27 of the upper limit estimates are @xmath28 km s@xmath29 for @xmath30 ; figure  [ fig : vplunge ] suggests a weak dependence on @xmath27 .",
    "lower limit estimates are more strongly spin - dependent ; the averages over @xmath27 are @xmath31 km s@xmath29 for the same values of @xmath26 . for moderately large spins ( @xmath32 ) and prograde capture ,",
    "the lower limit estimates exceed @xmath33 km s@xmath29 for @xmath34 . in",
    "what follows , we will assume that @xmath35 km s@xmath29 is an absolute upper limit to @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the gravitational potential of the system ( galaxy , dark matter halo ) hosting the bh , the bh has enough kinetic energy to escape .",
    "figure [ fig : escape ] shows central escape velocities in four types of stellar system that could contain merging bhs : giant elliptical galaxies ( e ) , dwarf ellipticals ( de ) , dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) and globular clusters ( gc ) .",
    "we fit the trend @xmath38 separately for each class of object . des and gcs",
    "each separately establish a relation @xmath39 ; for gcs , this is compatible with the relation found by @xcite .",
    "the e sample is consistent with the faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation .    the solid line in figure [ fig : escape ] shows escape velocities from the dark matter ( dm ) halos associated with the luminous stellar systems .",
    "to relate halo properties to galaxy luminosities , we use the conditional luminosity function @xmath40 from the concordance @xmath41cdm model m1 of @xcite .",
    "this function gives the number of galaxies in the luminosity range @xmath42 that reside inside a halo with virial mass @xmath43 .",
    "the average luminosity @xmath44 of the brightest ( `` central '' ) galaxy in the halo of mass @xmath43 is implicitly given by the condition @xmath45 .",
    "inverting this we obtain @xmath46 and relate this mass to the escape velocity via @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the virial radius of the halo , @xmath49 is the concentration of a halo obeying the navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ; hereafter nfw ) profile , and @xmath50^{-1}$ ] ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . both @xmath51 and @xmath49",
    "are functions of @xmath43 and the redshift @xmath52 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . at @xmath53",
    "the average escape velocity is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the hubble parameter , set to @xmath57 in figure [ fig : escape ] .",
    "the upturn in escape velocity for galaxies brighter than @xmath58 is a consequence of the increase in the occupation number of their host halos .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : escape ] shows the escape velocity from the combined luminous + dm potential for the e galaxies , using the scaling relation derived above to describe the luminous component .",
    "figure [ fig : escape ] suggests that the consequences of the kicks are strikingly different for the different classes of stellar system that might host bhs . escape velocities from e galaxies are dominated by the stellar contribution to the potential ; in the sample of faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , @xmath59 even without accounting for dm .",
    "this exceeds even the upper limits in figure [ fig : vplunge ] .",
    "hence , the kicks should almost never unbind bhs from e galaxies .",
    "the tight correlations observed between bh mass and bulge luminosity @xciteand velocity dispersion @xcite could probably not be maintained if escape occurred with any significant frequency from luminous galaxies .",
    "the existence of dm significantly affects the escape probability from de and dsph galaxies , implying kicks of @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively for escape . in the absence of dm",
    ", these numbers would be @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "hence , kicks of order 200 km s@xmath29 would unbind bhs from dsph galaxies whether or not they contain dm , while de galaxies could retain their bhs if they are surrounded by dm halos .",
    "evidence for intermediate - mass black holes at the centers of galaxies fainter than @xmath63 is sketchy ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , although there is indirect ( non - dynamical ) evidence for bhs in faint seyfert bulges @xcite .",
    "we note that the dense nuclei associated with bhs in galaxies like m32 ( @xmath63 ) become progressively less frequent at magnitudes fainter than @xmath64 and disappear entirely below @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "if the dense nuclei are associated with nuclear bhs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , their absence could signal loss of the bhs via ejection .",
    "it is intriguing that these nuclei are sometimes observed to be displaced far from the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : vplunge ] and [ fig : escape ] imply that even kicks at the lower limits of paper i would almost always unbind bhs from gcs .",
    "the kicks have serious implications for models in which massive bhs grow from mergers of less massive seeds . in some of these models ,",
    "the precursors are stellar- or intermediate - mass black holes produced in the collapse of the first stars ( population iii ) and the merging commenced in minihalos at redshifts as large as @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the plausibility of such models in light of the estimates of @xmath16 derived in paper i. kicks from gravitational wave emission may compete with high - velocity recoils @xcite from ( newtonian ) three - body interactions . while the newtonian recoil occurs",
    "only when three bhs are present , which is contingent on the galaxy merger rate and the bh binary orbital decay rate , radiation recoil is present whenever bhs coalesce .",
    "the confining effect of dm halos in a hierarchical universe was smaller at higher redshifts when the average halo mass was smaller .",
    "we estimate the maximum redshift at which dm halos can confine the progenitors of the present - day bhs .",
    "@xcite derived a relation of the present - day bh mass @xmath67 to the mass of the host halo @xmath68 .",
    "we use the @xcite form of the relation ( their equation 11 ) to obtain the host halo mass and extrapolate the mass back in redshift via the accretion history model @xcite calibrated by @xcite on a set of numerical simulations of dm clustering in a @xmath41cdm universe .",
    "the accretion trajectory @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is itself a function of the halo mass at @xmath53 , can be interpreted as the mass of the most massive , and thus the most easily confining parent halo at redshift @xmath52 .",
    "we can then calculate the escape velocity @xmath71 of the most massive progenitor halo as a function of redshift .",
    "finally , we solve for @xmath72 such that @xmath73 ; this is the maximum redshift at which the progenitors of the present - day bhs could have started merging .",
    "we also modelled the effect on @xmath72 of including the potential due to a stellar component , idealized as an isothermal sphere with core radius @xmath74 and outer cutoff @xmath75 ; the 1d stellar velocity dispersion @xmath76 was related to halo circular velocity as in ferrarese ( 2002 ) .",
    "the results for five representative choices of @xmath16 are shown in figure [ fig : zeject ] . for @xmath77 ,",
    "we find @xmath78 over the entire range of @xmath79 ; the latter value is from the models that include a stellar component . for @xmath80 , the assembly of a @xmath81 bh",
    "must have started at @xmath82 .",
    "models that grow supermassive bhs from mergers of seeds of much lower mass at redshifts @xmath83 are thus disfavored due to the difficulty of retaining the kicked bhs .",
    "the effects of the kicks could be mitigated if early growth of the bhs was dominated by accretion , or if bh mergers were delayed until their halos had grown much more massive .",
    "a bh that has been kicked from the center of a stellar system with a velocity less than @xmath84 falls back and its orbit decays via dynamical friction against the stars and gas .",
    "we define the fallback time @xmath85 as the time required for a bh to return to a zero - velocity state after being ejected .",
    "the velocity with which the bh is ejected from the site of the merger is @xmath86 ; here @xmath87 with @xmath88 the mass in stars that remain bound to the bh after it is kicked . for recoil in a singular isothermal sphere nucleus @xmath89 , @xmath90",
    "when @xmath91 where @xmath76 is the 1d stellar velocity dispersion ; @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "we evaluated @xmath85 for bhs kicked from the centers of dehnen ( 1993)-law galaxies for which the central density obeys @xmath94 .",
    "bright e galaxies have @xmath95 @xcite , and cusps steeper than this are likely to be softened by the binary bh prior to coalescence @xcite and by the ejection itself (  5 ) . given values for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the fallback time in a spherical galaxy is given by the orbit - averaged dynamical friction equation @xcite .",
    "for @xmath98 , infall times were found to be well approximated by @xmath99 for @xmath100 , where the period @xmath101 of a circular orbit at the galaxy s half - light radius is given in terms of the galaxy s visual luminosity by @xmath102 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , return of a bh to a stationary state requires of order a few times @xmath103 or less over a wide range of cusp slopes and galaxy luminosities for @xmath104 .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : escape ] , this is the likely situation in the bright e galaxies .",
    "infall times are especially short for @xmath105 , since the bh experiences a strong impulsive frictional force as it passes repeatedly through the dense center . when @xmath106 , the bh never moves far from its central position and it carries much of the nucleus with it .",
    "we carried out @xmath107-body simulations of this regime and found that return to zero velocity occurs in roughly one orbital period when @xmath106 . in fainter de and dsph galaxies ,",
    "ejection would more often occur near @xmath84 and infall times could be arbitrarily long , determined primarily by the mass distribution at large radii .    in a nonspherical galaxy ,",
    "an ejected bh does not pass precisely through the dense center on each return , delaying the infall . to test the effect of non - spherical geometries on the infall time",
    ", we carried out experiments in the triaxial generalizations of the dehnen models @xcite .",
    "results were found to depend only weakly on the axis ratios of the models .",
    "decay times in the triaxial geometry exhibit a spread in values depending on the initial launch angle , bounded from below by the decay time along the short axis .",
    "we found a mean at every @xmath108 that is @xmath109 times greater than in a spherical galaxy with the same cusp slope .",
    "displacement of the bh also transfers energy to the nucleus and lowers its density within a region of size @xmath110 , the radius of the bh s sphere of influence ( defined here as the radius of a sphere containing a mass in stars equal to twice that of the bh ) . the simplest case to consider is @xmath111 ; the bh and its entrained mass depart",
    "the nucleus on a time scale that is of order the crossing time at @xmath112 or less and do not return .",
    "the effect on the nucleus can be approximated by constructing a steady - state model of a galaxy containing a central point mass , then removing the point mass instantaneously and allowing the remaining particles to relax to a new steady state .",
    "figure [ fig : change]a shows the results for three values of @xmath113 .",
    "initial conditions consisted of @xmath114 particles representing stars in a @xmath115 dehnen model .",
    "we find that a core of roughly constant density forms within a radius of @xmath116 .",
    "setting @xmath117 ( not shown ) results in a core of size @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig : change]b shows the change in the nuclear density profile for simulations with @xmath118 .",
    "significant changes in the central density require @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude that the recoil could affect the observable structure of nuclei , since radii of @xmath120 are resolved in many nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the `` mass deficits '' seen at the centers of bright galaxies @xcite may be due to the combined effects of slingshot ejection and bh displacement , although we note that the large cores observed in some bright galaxies could probably not be produced by either mechanism @xcite .",
    "the x - shaped radio sources associated with giant e galaxies @xcite are plausible sites of recent bh coalescence @xcite .",
    "displacement of the merged bhs from the galaxy center prior to ignition of the `` active '' lobes would imply a distortion of the x - morphology , in the sense that the `` wings '' ( the inactive lobes ) would be non - collinear near the center of the x. such distortions are in fact a common feature of the x - sources @xcite , although the linear scale of the distortions in some of the x - sources ( e.g. @xmath121 kpc in ngc 236 ; @xcite ) suggests that orbital motion of the merging galaxies may be a more likely explanation @xcite .",
