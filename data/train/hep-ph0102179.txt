    "one of the lhc supergoals is the discovery of the supersymmetry . in particular",
    ", it is very important to investigate a possibility to discover strongly interacting superparticles ( squarks and gluino ) . in ref.@xcite ( see ,",
    "also references @xcite ) the lhc squark and gluino discovery potential has been investigated within the minimal sugra - mssm framework @xcite where all sparticle masses are determined mainly by two parameters : @xmath4 ( common squark and slepton mass at gut scale ) and @xmath5 ( common gaugino mass at gut scale ) .",
    "the signature used for the search for squarks and gluino at lhc is @xmath6 + @xmath7 leptons + @xmath8 events .",
    "the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that lhc is able to detect squarks and gluino with masses up to ( 2 - 2.5 ) tev . in ref .",
    "@xcite the lhc susy discovery potential has been investigated for the case of nonuniversal gaugino masses with universal squark masses for the first , second and third generations .",
    "the conclusion of the ref .",
    "@xcite is that visibility of signal by an excess over sm background in @xmath9 events depends rather strongly on the relation between lsp , gluino and squark masses and it decreases with the increase of lsp mass .",
    "for relatively heavy lsp mass closed to squark or gluino masses and for @xmath10 signal is too small to be observable .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the squark and gluino pair production at lhc ( cms ) with subsequent decays into quarks , leptons and lsp in models with effective supersymmetry  @xcite where third generation of squarks is relatively light while the first two generations of squarks are heavy  .",
    "models with effective supersymmetry solve in natural way the problems with flavour - changing neutral currents , lepton flavor violation , electric dipole moments of electron and neutron and proton decay . in such models",
    "there are two mass scales : gauginos , higgsinos and third generation squarks are rather light to stabilize electroweak scale , while the first two generations of squarks and sleptons are heavy with masses @xmath11 .",
    "we investigate the general case when the relation among gaugino masses is arbitrary .",
    "we study the detection of supersymmetry using classical signature @xmath12 jets + @xmath13leptons + @xmath14 .",
    "we find that the susy discovery potential depends rather strongly on the relation among squarks , gluino , lsp and second neutralino masses and it decreases with the increase of lsp mass .",
    "for relatively heavy gluino it would be very difficult or even impossible to detect susy signal even for light @xmath1  generation squarks ( @xmath15 ) if the lsp mass is closed to the @xmath1  generation squark mass .",
    "it should be noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite atlas detector discovery potential of sugra - mssm model with focus point effective supersymmetry for @xmath16 and @xmath17 has been studied for signature @xmath18 jets @xmath19 isolated lepton plus @xmath8 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the signature `` @xmath20  @xmath21''resulting from the gluino decay into @xmath22 has been used for the detection of the signal in such models .",
    "the decays of squarks and gluino depend on the relation among squark and gluino masses . for @xmath23 squarks decay mainly into gluino and quarks    * @xmath24    and gluino decays mainly into quark - antiquark pair and gaugino    * @xmath25    * @xmath26    for @xmath27 gluino decays mainly into squarks and quarks    * @xmath28    whereas squarks decay mainly into quarks and gaugino    * @xmath29    * @xmath30    the lightest chargino @xmath31 has several leptonic decay modes giving a lepton and missing energy :    three - body decay    * @xmath32 ,    two - body decays    * @xmath33 , + @xmath34 * @xmath35 , + @xmath36 * @xmath37 .",
    "+ @xmath38    leptonic decays of @xmath39 give two leptons and missing energy :    three - body decays    * @xmath40 , * @xmath41 , + @xmath42    two - body decay    * @xmath43 .",
    "+ @xmath44    as a result of chargino and second neutralino leptonic decays besides classical signature    * @xmath12 jets plus @xmath14    signatures    * @xmath12 jets plus @xmath45 leptons plus @xmath14    with leptons and jets in final state arise .",
    "as mentioned above , these signatures have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for investigation of lhc(cms ) squark and gluino discovery potential within sugra - mssm model , in which gaugino masses @xmath46 , @xmath47 are determined mainly by a common gaugino mass @xmath5 .",
    "the cross section for the production of strongly interacting superparticles @xmath48 depends on gluino and squark masses . within sugra - mssm model",
    "the following approximate relations among sparticle masses take place : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    despite the simplicity of the sugra - mssm framework it is a very particular model .",
    "the mass formulae for sparticles in sugra - mssm model are derived under the assumption that at gut scale ( @xmath53  gev ) soft supersymmetry breaking terms are universal .",
    "however , in general , we can expect that real sparticle masses can differ in a drastic way from sparticle masses pattern of sugra - mssm model due to many reasons , see for instance refs .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to investigate the lhc susy discovery potential in a model - independent way .",
    "our simulations are made at the particle level with parametrized detector responses based on a detailed detector simulation . to be concrete our estimates",
    "have been made for the cms(compact muon solenoid ) detector .",
    "the cms detector simulation program cmsjet  4.701  @xcite is used .",
    "the main aspects of the cmsjet relevant to our study are the following .",
    "* charged particles are tracked in a 4 t magnetic field .",
    "90 percent reconstruction efficiency per charged track with @xmath54 gev within @xmath55 is assumed .    *",
    "the geometrical acceptances for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are @xmath58 and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "the lepton momentum is smeared according to parametrizations obtained from full geant simulations . for a 10 gev lepton",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath59 is better than one percent over the full @xmath60 coverage . for a 100 gev lepton",
    "the resolution becomes @xmath61 depending on @xmath60 .",
    "we have assumed a 90 percent triggering plus reconstruction efficiency per lepton within the geometrical acceptance of the cms detector .    *",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter of cms extends up to @xmath62 .",
    "there is a pointing crack in the ecal barrel / endcap transition region between @xmath63 ( 6 ecal crystals ) .",
    "the hadronic calorimeter covers @xmath64 .",
    "the very forward calorimeter extends from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "noise terms have been simulated with gaussian distributions and zero suppression cuts have been applied .    *",
    "@xmath67 and hadron shower development are taken into account by parametrization of the lateral and longitudinal profiles of showers . the starting point of a shower",
    "is fluctuated according to an exponential law .    * for jet reconstruction we have used a slightly modified ua1 jet finding algorithm , with a cone size of @xmath68 and 25 gev transverse energy threshold on jets .",
    "all susy processes with full particle spectrum , couplings , production cross section and decays are generated with isajet  7.42 , isasusy  @xcite .",
    "the standard model backgrounds are generated by pythia  5.7  @xcite .",
    "we have used steq3l structure functions .",
    "the following sm processes give the main contribution to the background :    @xmath69 and qcd @xmath70 processes .",
    "as it has been mentioned above in this paper we consider signature @xmath71 jets plus @xmath72 isolated leptons plus @xmath14 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "namely we have considered signatures  :    * @xmath71 jets plus @xmath8 , * @xmath71 jets plus @xmath8 plus no isolated leptons , * @xmath71 jets plus @xmath8 plus @xmath75 isolated lepton , * @xmath71 jets plus @xmath8 plus @xmath76 pair of isolated leptons , * @xmath71 jets plus @xmath8 plus @xmath77 pair of isolated leptons , * @xmath71 jets plus @xmath8 plus @xmath78 isolated leptons .    for leptons we use cut @xmath79 .",
    "our definition of isolated lepton coincides with the definition used in cmsjet code  @xcite .",
    "we use two sets of cuts ( a and b ) for @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "cuts a and b are presented in tables 1 and 2 , correspondingly .",
    "besides we require that @xmath83 .",
    "we have calculated sm backgrounds for different values of @xmath84 using pythia  5.7 code  @xcite .",
    "we have considered two values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we considered both cases of heavy and relatively light gluino .",
    "we considered different values of lsp and second neutralino masses . in our calculations",
    "we took the value of the masses of the first and second squark generations equal to @xmath87 .",
    "however for @xmath88 the results practically do not depend on the value of @xmath89 .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in tables ( 3 - 41 ) and in fig.(1 - 4 ) .",
    "note that there is a crucial difference between the `` future '' experiment and the `` real '' experiment  @xcite . in the `` real '' experiment",
    "the total number of events @xmath90 is a given number and we compare it with expected @xmath91 when we test the validity of standard physics . in the condition of the `` future '' experiment we know only the average number of the background events @xmath91 and the average number of signal events @xmath92 , so we have to compare the poisson distributions @xmath93 and @xmath94 to determine the probability to find new physics in the future experiment . according to common definition new physics discovery potential corresponds to the case when the probability that background can imitate signal is less than @xmath95 or in terms of the probability less than @xmath96 .",
    "so we require that the probability @xmath97 of the background fluctuations for @xmath98 is less than @xmath99 , namely ,    @xmath100    the discovery probability @xmath101 that the number of signal events will be bigger than @xmath102 is equal to    @xmath103 .",
    "we require that @xmath104 .",
    "as it follows from our results for fixed values of squark and gluino masses the visibility of signal decreases with the increase of the lsp mass .",
    "this fact has trivial explanation .",
    "indeed , in the rest frame of squark or gluino the jets spectrum becomes more soft with the increase of the lsp mass . besides in parton model pair",
    "produced squarks and gluino are produced with total transverse momentum closed to zero . for high lsp masses partial cancellation of missing transverse momenta from two lsp particles takes place .",
    "note that for the case of relatively light @xmath1 squark generation @xmath105-quarks in the final state dominate .",
    "however , in our calculations we have not used b - tagging to suppress the background and to make signal more observable .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of the investigation of lhc ( cms ) susy discovery potential for the models with effective supersymmetry .",
    "we have considered general case of nonuniversal gaugino masses .",
    "we have found that the visibility of signal by an excess over sm background in @xmath106 events depends rather strongly on the relation between lsp , second neutralino , gluino and @xmath1 generation squark masses and it decreases with the increase of lsp mass .",
    "for relatively heavy gluino it would be very difficult or even impossible to detect susy signal even for light @xmath1  generation squarks ( @xmath15 ) if the lsp mass is closed to the @xmath1  generation squark mass .",
