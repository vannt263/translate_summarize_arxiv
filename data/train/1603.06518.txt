    "the sphere packing problem asks how to arrange congruent balls as densely as possible without overlap between their interiors .",
    "the _ density _ is the fraction of space covered by the balls , and the problem is to find the maximal possible density .",
    "this problem plays an important role in geometry , number theory , and information theory .",
    "see @xcite for background and references on sphere packing and its applications .",
    "although many interesting constructions are known , provable optimality is very rare . aside from the trivial case of one dimension ,",
    "the optimal density was previously known only in two @xcite , three @xcite , and eight @xcite dimensions , with the latter result being a recent breakthrough due to viazovska ( see @xcite for expositions ) .",
    "building on her work , we solve the sphere packing problem in twenty - four dimensions :    [ thm : main ] the leech lattice achieves the optimal sphere packing density in @xmath0 , and it is the only periodic packing in @xmath0 with that density , up to scaling and isometries .    in particular , the optimal sphere packing density in @xmath0 is that of the leech lattice , namely @xmath1 for an appealing construction of the leech lattice , see section  2.8 of @xcite .",
    "it is unknown in general whether optimal packings have any special structure , but our theorem shows that they do in @xmath0 .",
    "the optimality and uniqueness of the leech lattice were previously known only among lattice packings @xcite , which is a far more restrictive setting .",
    "recall that a lattice is a discrete subgroup of @xmath2 of rank @xmath3 , and a lattice packing uses spheres centered at the points of a lattice , while a periodic packing is the union of finitely many translates of a lattice .",
    "lattices are far more algebraically constrained , and it is widely believed that they do not achieve the optimal density in most dimensions ( for example , see @xcite for an example in @xmath4 of a periodic packing that is denser than any known lattice ) . by contrast ,",
    "periodic packings at least come arbitrarily close to the optimal sphere packing density .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] will be based on the linear programming bounds for sphere packing , as given by the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : lp ] let @xmath5 be a schwartz function and @xmath6 a positive real number such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 for @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "then the sphere packing density in @xmath2 is at most @xmath12    here @xmath13 means @xmath14 when @xmath3 is odd , and the fourier transform is normalized by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the usual inner product on @xmath2 . without loss of generality , we can radially symmetrize @xmath17 , in which case @xmath18 is radial as well .",
    "we will often tacitly identify radial functions on @xmath0 with functions on @xmath19 and vice versa , by using @xmath20 with @xmath21 to denote the common value @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "all fourier transforms will be in @xmath0 unless otherwise specified .",
    "in other words , if @xmath17 is a function of one variable defined on @xmath19 , then @xmath24 means @xmath25 where @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27 .",
    "optimizing the bound from theorem  [ thm : main ] requires choosing the right auxiliary function @xmath17 .",
    "it was not previously known how to do so except in one dimension @xcite or eight @xcite , but cohn and elkies conjectured the existence of an auxiliary function proving the optimality of the leech lattice @xcite .",
    "we prove this conjecture by developing an analogue for the leech lattice of viazovska s construction for the @xmath28 root lattice .    in the case of the leech lattice , proving optimality amounts to achieving @xmath29 , which requires that @xmath17 and @xmath18 have roots on the spheres of radius @xmath30 about the origin for @xmath31 .",
    "see @xcite for further explanation and discussion of this condition .",
    "furthermore , the argument in section  8 of @xcite shows that if @xmath17 has no other roots at distance @xmath32 or more , then the leech lattice is the unique optimal periodic packing in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] reduces to constructing such a function",
    ".    the existence of an optimal auxiliary function in @xmath0 has long been anticipated , and cohn and miller made further conjectures in @xcite about special values of the function , which we also prove .",

    "there is no problem with the integral in as @xmath59 , because @xmath192 vanishes in this limit by and .",
    "however , the exponential growth of @xmath192 as @xmath56 causes divergence when @xmath6 is too small for @xmath193 to counteract this growth . to estimate the growth rate , note that by and , the @xmath194 terms cancel in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath192 as @xmath56 , which means that @xmath195 .",
    "thus , the formula for @xmath24 converges when @xmath191 , and it must equal @xmath24 by analytic continuation .",
    "note that it can not hold for the whole interval @xmath196 , because that would force @xmath18 to vanish at @xmath98 , which does not happen .",

    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the proof in section  [ sec : proof ] requires checking certain inequalities for quasimodular forms on the imaginary axis .",
    "fortunately , these inequalities are not too delicate , because equality is never attained .",
    "the behavior at infinity is easily analyzed , which reduces the proof to verifying the inequalities on a compact interval , and that can be done by a finite calculation .",
    "thus , these inequalities are clearly provable if true .",
    "the proof of the analogous inequalities in @xcite used interval arithmetic , but in this appendix we take a different approach , based on applying sturm s theorem to truncated @xmath57-series .",

    "our code is for the free computer algebra system pari / gp ( see @xcite ) , but the calculations are simple enough that they are not difficult to check in any computer algebra system .    to prove each inequality , we approximate the modular form using @xmath57-series and prove error bounds for truncating the series , which we then incorporate by adding them to an appropriate term of the truncated series .",
    "the result is nearly a polynomial in @xmath57 , with the possible exceptions being factors of @xmath210 ( where @xmath54 ) , and we bound those factors so as to reduce to the case of a polynomial in @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , we bound any factors of @xmath211 so that the coefficients become rational",
    ". finally , we use sturm s theorem with exact rational arithmetic to verify that the truncated series never changes sign .    to prove the error bounds , we need to control the growth of the coefficients .",
    "we first multiply by @xmath212 to clear the denominators that appear in , , and .",
    "the advantage of doing so is that the coefficients of the numerator grow only polynomially .",
    "to estimate the growth rate , we bound the coefficient of @xmath213 in @xmath214 by @xmath215 in absolute value , in @xmath216 by @xmath217 , and in @xmath218 by @xmath219 .",
    "it is also not difficult to show that the coefficient of @xmath220 in @xmath221 , @xmath222 or @xmath223 is at most @xmath215 in absolute value .",
    "and @xmath223 have nonnegative coefficients , and their sum is the theta series of the @xmath224 root lattice in the variable @xmath225 , from which one can bound their coefficients .",

    "these bounds are inefficient , but they suffice for our purposes .    when @xmath208 , @xmath235 is small enough that these coefficient bounds yield a reasonable error term .",
    "when @xmath182 , we replace it with @xmath236 ( via @xmath237 ) and compute the corresponding @xmath57-expansion .",
    "first , we prove this inequality for @xmath208 , in which case @xmath240 .",
    "the bounds described above show that the coefficient of @xmath213 in @xmath232 is at most @xmath241 in absolute value , and exact computation shows that @xmath242 thus , the sum of the absolute values of the terms in @xmath232 for @xmath243 amounts to at most @xmath244 .",

    "note that we could have avoided fractional powers of @xmath57 in this proof if we had used a different upper bound for @xmath210 , but fractional powers will be needed to handle @xmath142 and @xmath155 in any case .",

    "we use exactly the same technique as in the proof of lemma  [ lemma : phinonpos ] . for @xmath208 , removing the @xmath261 and higher terms in the @xmath57-series for @xmath262 introduces an error of at most @xmath244 , and sturm s theorem shows that the resulting polynomial has no sign changes .",
