    "charmonium - like states discovered during last years mainly in the exclusive b - meson decays as resonances in the relevant mass distributions became interesting objects for both experimental and theoretical studies in high energy physics .",
    "conventional hadrons , composed of two and three quarks , and investigated in a rather detailed form constitute main part of the known particles . at the same time , the theory of the strong interactions ",
    "the quantum chromodynamics does not contain principles excluding an existence of the multiquark states .",
    "the tetraquark and pentaquark states composed of the four and five valence quarks , respectively , and hybrids built of the quarks and gluons are among most promising candidates to occupy the vacant shelves in the multiquark spectroscopy . due to joint efforts of experimentalists and theorists considerable progress in understanding of the quark - gluon structure of the multiquark exotic states and explaining of their properties were achieved , but remaining questions are more numerous that answered ones ( for latest reviews , see refs .",

    "the main source of problems , which complicates the studying of the charmonium - like tetraquarks , is the existence of the conventional charmonium states in the energy ranges of the exploring decay processes .",
    "charmonia generate difficulties in interpretation of experimental results , because the pure @xmath13 states may emerge as the resonances in the mass distributions of the processes , or generate background effects due to states dynamically connected with @xmath13 levels . only after eliminating effects of the charmonium states in forming of the experimental data , observed resonances can be considered as real exotic particles .",
    "the well - known @xmath14 state is the best sample to illustrate existing problems .",
    "it was discovered as very narrow resonance in b meson decay @xmath15 by the belle collaboration @xcite , and was later confirmed in cdf , d0 and babar experiments ( see , refs .",
    "cdf:2004,d0:2004,babar:2005 ) .",
    "its other production mechanisms running through decay chains @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 were also experimentally measured and comprehensively studied abe:2005ix , aubert:2008ae .",
    "the gathered information poses severe restrictions on theoretical models claiming to describe a behavior of the @xmath14 state .",
    "attempts were made to explain the collected data by treating @xmath19 as the exited conventional charmonium @xmath20 barnes:2005pb , or as the state formed due to dynamical coupled - channel effects @xcite .",
    "it was considered in the context of four - quark compounds , both as the @xmath21 molecule or its admixtures with the charmonium states close:2003sg , tornqvist:2004qy , zanetti:2011ju , guo:2014taa , and as the diquark - antidiquarks states maiani:2004vq , maiani:2007vr , navarra:2006nd , dubnicka:2010kz , wang:2013vex .",
    "but existence of the tetraquarks , which do not contain @xmath22 or @xmath23 pairs is also possible , because fundamental laws of qcd do not forbid production of such resonances in hadronic processes .",
    "these particles may appear in the exclusive reactions as the open charm ( i.e. , as states containing @xmath24 or @xmath25 quarks ) and open bottom resonances .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons discovered by the babar and cleo collaborations @xcite , are now being considered as candidates to open charm tetraquark states . the @xmath28 resonance remains a unique candidate to the open bottom tetraquark , which is additionally considering as a particle containing four different quarks .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental situation formed around @xmath28 remains unclear .",
    "indeed , the evidence for @xmath28 was first announced by the d0 collaboration in ref .",
    "later it was seen again by d0 in the @xmath29 meson s semileptonic decays @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the lhcb and cms collaborations could not see the same resonance from analysis of their experimental data @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations aiming to explain the nature of @xmath28 and calculate its parameters lead also to contradictory conclusions .",
    "predictions obtained in some of these works are in a nice agreement with results of the d0 collaboration , while in others even an existence of the @xmath28 state is an object of doubts .",
    "the detailed discussions of these and related questions of the @xmath30 state physics can be found in original works ( see , ref .",

    "the open charm - bottom tetraquarks belong to another type of exotic states .",
    "they did not yet observed experimentally , but already attracted interest of physicists .",
    "the original investigations of these particles started more than two decades ago , and , therefore , a considerable theoretical information on their expecting properties is available in the literature .",

    "the scalar and axial - vector open charm - bottom diquark - antidiquark states can be modeled using different type of interpolating currents @xcite .",
