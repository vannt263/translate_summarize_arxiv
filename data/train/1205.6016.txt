    "quantification of multipartite entanglement has remained an outstanding but important challenge in quantum information science . besides applications in quantum information science , multipartite states have served as crucial resources for a myriad of quantum information processing tasks ranging from quantum cryptography and secret sharing @xcite to quantum simulation @xcite , measurement - base quantum computation @xcite and high precision metrology @xcite .    while bipartite entanglement is well understood ,",
    "genuine multipartite entangled states are less studied .",
    "genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement needs entanglement of all @xmath0 constituent systems .",
    "it should not be separable for any partition of the system .",
    "moreover , it turns out that genuine multipartite entanglement are needed in several quantum information processes .",
    "thus it is important to detect not just multipartite entanglement @xcite but also genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "however , detection of genuine multipartite entangled state experimentally however has proved elusive .",
    "bennett@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ have recently proposed some reasonable postulates for measures of genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "they gave the following postulates or definitions :    _ definition 1 .",
    "_ a state of @xmath0 particles has genuine @xmath0-partite correlations if it is not a product state in every bipartite cut .",
    "_ definition 2 .",
    "_ a state of @xmath0 particles has genuine @xmath1-partite correlations if there exists a @xmath1-particle subset whose reduced state has genuine @xmath1-partite correlations .",
    "_ definition 3 .",
    "_ a state has degree of correlations equal to @xmath0 if there exists a subset of @xmath0 particles which has genuine @xmath0-partite correlations and there does not exist a subsets of @xmath2 particles which has genuine @xmath2-partite correlations for any @xmath3 .",
    "the above definition is slightly different from the genuine multipartite entanglement , i.e. , for pure state , a state has genuine @xmath0-partite correlation if and only if it has genuine entanglement . for mixed state , however , a state has genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement if it is not a mixture of pure states that do not have genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement . comparing the definitions , it is not difficult to find that the set of genuine correlated states that contains the set of genuine entanglement states for mixed states .",
    "very recently , giorgi@xcite _ et al . _",
    "introduced a measure of genuine total , classical , and quantum correlations based on the use of the relative entropy to quantify the distance between the studied and the corresponding benchmark states ; rulli@xcite _ et al . _",
    "introduce some measure of global quantum discord and geometry discord . beside these , very little is known to us on multipartite quantum correlation . in this paper , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for detecting genuine multipartite correlations for arbitrary @xmath0-qubit quantum system in terms of the coefficient matrices of the pure state .",
    "then we demonstrate an approach to decompose a state into the product of genuine correlated states .",
    "we first review the construction of coefficient matrix as introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be an @xmath0-qubit pure state .",
    "we rewrite @xmath5 as @xmath6 . a coefficient matrix associated to the state @xmath7",
    "is given by @xmath8 we remark that the splitting of @xmath9 is arbitrary so @xmath10 can take any possible values . for more general case",
    ", we designate a permutation @xmath11 of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 be the coefficient matrix corresponding to the permutation constructed from @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ ma-1 ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we omit the subscripts @xmath15 and simply write @xmath16 , whenever the column bits are clear from the context . if @xmath5 is a bipartite product state , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath17 , by the construction of the coefficient matrix , we have the rank of @xmath18 must be @xmath19 . together with definition 1 , we obtain a very easy criterion to detect the genuine multipartite correlation for pure @xmath0-qubit state .",
    "a pure @xmath0-qubit state @xmath20 has genuine @xmath0-partite correlations if and only if for every permutation @xmath11 and @xmath21 , the rank of the coefficient matrix has @xmath22 .    to show the power of theorem 1 , we first give an example to show that the @xmath0-qubit symmetric dicke states @xmath23 with @xmath24 excitations @xcite @xmath25 have genuine correlations , where @xmath26 is the set of all distinct permutation of the spins .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the rank of @xmath23 is @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 for any permutation . by theorem 1",
    ", we have that any @xmath0-qubit symmetric dicke states @xmath23 with @xmath30 have genuine correlations , for @xmath31 or @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both product state .",
    "we now further consider arbitrary permutation symmetric pure @xmath0-qubit state , by using vieta s formulas , any symmetric pure @xmath0-qubit state can be written into the combination of symmetric dicke states@xcite , @xmath35 we first state that if there exist @xmath30 such that @xmath36 , then @xmath5 in ( [ sysmetry ] ) must have genuine correlation .",
    "in fact , for any permutation , one selects @xmath37 so that @xmath38 bits are equal to @xmath39 and the rest of bits are equal to @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 , the coefficient of @xmath44 is @xmath45 , and that of @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "we can find that the foregoing coefficients constitute a @xmath48 nonzero minor of the coefficient matrix .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath49 , and the state has genuine multipartite correlation . if we have @xmath50 for all @xmath30 , that is @xmath51 , then @xmath5 is given as @xmath52 which is a product state .",
    "in summary , we find that an arbitrary symmetric pure @xmath0-qubit states have genuine correlations except the state is in one of the following three cases : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ sysmetryequ ] ) .",
    "thus , we have completely describe the genuine correlations for arbitrary symmetric pure @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "using theorem 1 , we can decompose a pure state into a product of genuine correlated states . for any pure state @xmath5 , if there exists a permutation @xmath11 and @xmath21 such that @xmath55 , then we have the decomposition @xmath17 .",
    "we can further decompose @xmath56 into a product of some other states , and eventually obtain that @xmath5 be the product of some genuine correlated states .",
    "it is not difficult to discern that for any pure state , regardless of the permutation , the decomposition to genuine correlated states is unique@xcite . by definitions 2 and 3 , for any pure state",
    ", we immediately have the following theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 has the decomposition @xmath57 , and @xmath5 has genuine @xmath58-partite correlations , then the degree of correlations is @xmath59 , here @xmath60 are states of @xmath58-particles genuine correlated states , and @xmath61 .",
    "we next consider the detection of genuine correlations for mixed state .",
    "suppose a @xmath0-particle state @xmath62 has a bipartite cut @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 be the spectral decomposition .",
    "the density matrices @xmath66 are the @xmath67-particle density matrix respectively(@xmath68 ) , and @xmath69 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath62 , the rank of @xmath62 is @xmath70 .",
    "we can regard @xmath71 as a reduced state of a pure @xmath72-qubit state @xmath73 similarly , @xmath74 can be seen as a reduced state of a pure @xmath75-qubit state @xmath76 thus , @xmath62 can be seen as a reduced state of a pure @xmath77-qubit state @xmath78    for a generic mixed state @xmath62 , we provide the following process to detect the genuine correlations .",
    "we first give the spectral decomposition of @xmath62 , @xmath79 for every factors @xmath80 of @xmath81 supply @xmath82 , we construct a pure @xmath83-qubit state @xmath84    one sees that @xmath62 is a reduced state of @xmath85 by tracing out the last @xmath86-partite",
    ". if @xmath62 has a bipartite cut with rank @xmath87 , eq .",
    "( [ phirp ] ) must take the form of eq .",
    "( [ phip ] ) , and since @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ phip ] ) is a product state , we have a permutation @xmath11 of @xmath12 , such that the rank of coefficient matrix of @xmath89 has @xmath90 , here @xmath21 . on the contrary , if there exists a permutation @xmath11 and @xmath91 such that the rank of the coefficient matrix of @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ phirp ] ) gives @xmath92 , then @xmath85 can be rewritten as a @xmath93-bipartite product state , by tracing out the @xmath86-partite , we obtain that @xmath62 is a product of @xmath94-partite by @xmath95-partite .",
    "thus , together with definition 1 given by bennett _",
    "_ , we have proved the following theorem .",
    "suppose a @xmath0-particle state @xmath62 has rank @xmath81 , the spectral decomposition of @xmath62 is given by @xmath96 , for every factors @xmath91 of @xmath81 supply @xmath82 , construct @xmath83-particle pure state @xmath85 in the form of eq .",
    "( [ phirp ] ) , then @xmath62 has genuine @xmath0-particle correlation if and only if for every @xmath91 , permutation @xmath11 , and @xmath21 , the rank of the coefficient matrix of @xmath89 gives rise to @xmath97 .",
    "theorem 3 provides us with a natural way to detect genuine @xmath1-partite correlations for a state @xmath62 of @xmath0 particles , and also its degree of correlations . according to the definition 2 , 3 , we need only check if there exists a subset @xmath98 of @xmath12 such that each reduced density matrix with @xmath98 particles , @xmath99 , has genuine multipartite correlations to confirm that @xmath62 has genuine @xmath1-particle correlations , and the maximum @xmath1 value is just the degree of correlations .",
    "we show a flow chart in fig . 1 to demonstrate the decomposition of an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit quantum state into a product of genuine @xmath1 correlated states .",
    "from the flowchart , we see that we can use an algorithmic approach to decompose a quantum state into a product of genuine @xmath1 correlated states , and obtain its degree of correlations .",
    "we now provide some illustrative examples concerning the usefulness of theorem 3 .",
    "consider the @xmath0-particle state @xmath100 , the rank of @xmath62 is @xmath101 , and @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ phirp ] ) given by @xmath102 since @xmath103 , for any @xmath104 , we can select the term @xmath105 in @xmath106 and @xmath107 in @xmath108 which are different on @xmath104-particles , notice that the coefficients of @xmath109 , @xmath110 are zero , we have @xmath111 has a nonzero @xmath112 minor .",
    "therefore @xmath113 for any @xmath114 , which means @xmath62 has genuine multipartite correlation . as a corollary , we can also show that @xmath115 has genuine multipartite correlation .     into spectral decomposition ;",
    "( 3 ) for every factors @xmath91 of the rank @xmath81 such that @xmath116 , construct @xmath83-partite pure state @xmath89 in eq .

    "`` t '' represent true , and `` f '' is false . ,",
    "it is shown by li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the rank of any coefficient matrix is invariant under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) . for the state with coefficient matrix of higher rank , we give the following theorem which indicates that the rank is a kind of measure of genuine multipartite correlations .    for a @xmath0 particle pure state @xmath5 , and a permutation @xmath11 , if the rank of the coefficient matrix @xmath122,(@xmath123 ) , then @xmath5 can be expressed as a sum of @xmath1 @xmath124 bipartite product states , each of them has no genuine correlation .",
    "we first consider the pure state .",
    "suppose the permutation @xmath11 and @xmath125 such that @xmath122 , we rewrite @xmath126 , where @xmath127 represents the @xmath128 qubit and @xmath129 represents the @xmath130 qubit . the coefficient matrix @xmath18 is given as @xmath131 .",
    "denote each column vector of matrix as @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the transpose of the vector , for convenience , we suppose @xmath135 is linear independent , and the rest of columns are the linear combination of the preceding @xmath1 columns , @xmath136 which means @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "we decompose @xmath5 into two terms , @xmath139 , where @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . inserting ( [ aij ] ) into @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 change the letter @xmath144 as @xmath145 , and @xmath145 as @xmath144 , we have",
    "that @xmath146 therefore , @xmath147 eq.([phirprpr ] ) means that @xmath148 is a sum of @xmath1 bipartite product states , which has no genuine correlation .",
    "it is shown that the sum of @xmath1 rank one matrix must has rank no more than @xmath1 , we obtain that @xmath5 can not be expressed as a sum of less than @xmath1 @xmath124 bipartite product states .",
    "to show how our algorithm works , we consider further some examples .",
    "we next study an example of the entanglement swapping .",
    "four bell states are given as @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the negation of @xmath152 .",
    "we now construct a four parties entanglement state @xmath153 as follows @xmath154 we can find that the coefficient matrix @xmath155 and @xmath156 are given by @xmath157 which is rank @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , by theorem 1 , @xmath153 has no genuine multipartite correlation and can be expressed as a product of @xmath158 and @xmath159 bipartite cut .",
    "in fact , @xmath160 is the condition for the so called entanglement swapping similar as teleportation , that is often invoked in quantum information processes so that a long - distance entangled state is generated from the short - distance entangled states .",
    "we next use our method to prove that smolin state @xcite has genuine multipartite correlation .",
    "the smolin state is given by @xmath161 eq .",
    "( [ rhoabcd ] ) is actually the spectral decomposition of @xmath62 , and the rank of @xmath62 is @xmath162 , which can be a factorization of @xmath112 and @xmath163 , thus , the purification of @xmath62 to @xmath164qubit pure state is given as @xmath165 explicitly , we have , @xmath166 it is an @xmath167-qubit pure state . by theorem 3 , we first check whether the rank of the following @xmath168 matrices @xmath169 @xmath170 are equal to one or not ( it is not difficult to find that @xmath171 )",
    ". it will be tedious for direct verifying since they are @xmath172 or @xmath173 order matrices . in the following ,",
    "we only need to show that there is a nonzero @xmath112 minor for each matrix .",
    "we first give a detailed construction of the nonzero @xmath112 minor of @xmath174 . from ( [ phyabse ] )",
    ", we select 2 terms and write them into @xmath175 bipartite cut , @xmath176 @xmath177 by ( [ phyabse ] ) the coefficients of @xmath178 and @xmath179 are @xmath180 , we further construct two terms , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which lie on the cross of the row and column of the forging two terms and do not belong to the terms of ( [ phyabse ] ) , the coefficients are @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the four coefficients constitute a nonzero @xmath112 minor of @xmath174 , which means @xmath183 .",
    "it is shown that for any permutation and combination of different parties , we can always find a nonzero minor of the coefficient , the submatrices we select are all @xmath184 .",
    "the purification of @xmath62 to @xmath185qubit pure state is given as @xmath186 for any permutation and combination of particles @xmath187 .",
    "since smolin state is highly symmetric , we can always find a nonzero @xmath112 minor of the coefficient matrix with combining @xmath188 , by theorem 3 , we have that the smolin state has genuine multipartite correlation .",
    "in this paper we provide an efficient method for detecting genuine multipartite correlations of arbitrary @xmath0-qubit system in terms of the rank of coefficient matrices .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for a state with genuine correlation can be related to the rank of the coefficient matrix of a pure state , which is shown to be invariant under slocc .",
    "the proposed measure satisfies those general postulates raised by bennett _",
    "_ in ref.@xcite .",
    "we would like to remark that the proposed method is essentially algorithmic .",
    "thus one can follow the algorithm systematically to check for the genuine multipartite correlation .",
    "we have also provided several interesting examples for pure or mixed state cases to illustrate the power of the approach , namely symmetric pure states , a state related to entanglement swapping , a mixed state of w state and ghz state ( which has genuine multipartite correlation ) , and the smolin state ( which also has genuine multipartite correlation ) .",
