    "one of the most fascinating aspects of the physics of ultracold gases @xcite is the ability , in appropriate situations , to describe the interaction between non identical fermionic atoms in terms of a single parameter , namely the scattering length @xmath2 for two different atoms .",
    "for example in fermionic gases involving only atoms in the two lowest hyperfine states of a single element , such as @xmath1li or @xmath0k , the interaction is fully described by the scattering length between atoms belonging to these two different hyperfine states @xcite . moreover in the presence of a feshbach resonance this scattering length can be experimentally modified almost at will by merely changing the applied magnetic field .",
    "the case of wide feshbach resonances is particularly convenient since all the physics related to the origin of the resonance , namely the existence of a closed channel , is irrelevant for most purposes .",
    "this has allowed , in the case of two fermionic atomic species , the experimental realization of the bec - bcs crossover where the scattering length goes from small negative values to small positive values through the resonance , where it diverges . for small negative values of the scattering length",
    "two different atoms have a weak effective attraction , which for high enough density and small enough temperature , leads to the formation of cooper pairs analogous to the ones appearing in superconductors and corresponding superfluid properties . on the other hand for small positive values of the scattering length @xmath3 , two fermionic atoms of different species form a bound state resulting in the appearance of molecules , or dimers , with binding energy @xmath4 .",
    "these dimers behave statistically as bosons , and again for high enough density and small enough temperature a bose - einstein condensate forms with superfluid properties .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover occurs when one goes continuously from the bose condensate to the bcs superfluid by merely varying the scattering length through the change of magnetic field .",
    "the simplicity of the description of the interaction extends to the bec limit , when one considers dimer - dimer interaction , while this is a priori a more complex situation since dimers have an internal structure .",
    "nevertheless the bec limit is quite simple since the composite bosons one deals with are dilute . in this case again the interaction between these bosons is fully characterized by their scattering length @xmath5 .",
    "this is because in the low temperature regime corresponding to the existence of the bose - einstein condensate , the kinetic energies of the dimers will be quite small compared to their binding energy , and the structure of these composite bosons will be irrelevant .",
    "this scattering length @xmath5 has been obtained @xcite , in terms of the scattering length @xmath2 for fermions , as @xmath6 when the different fermions have equal masses .    on the other hand when one goes away from the bec limit toward the unitarity limit , it is no longer true that the composite nature of the bosons is irrelevant .",
    "one might accordingly expect a more complex physics for this molecular gas .",
    "remarkably the @xmath7 equation of state on this bec side is nevertheless very well described @xcite in a wide domain of density by the lee - huang - yang @xcite equation of state for these composite bosons @xcite , making again merely use of the dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath5 between these bosons .",
    "this is as if these bosons were elementary .",
    "this is somewhat surprising .",
    "more precisely , assuming for example two fermions species with equal densities @xmath8 , a typical fermion wavevector is of order @xmath9 , and for @xmath10 the typical kinetic energy of a fermion is now of the same order as the dimer binding energy which is @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the reduced mass . in this case one has to consider the whole energy dependent scattering amplitude and not only its zero energy limit given by the scattering length .",
    "this is valid for dimer - dimer scattering as well as for single fermion - dimer scattering . in this last case",
    "these single fermions may arise because of thermal breaking of dimers , or because we consider unbalanced fermionic mixtures .",
    "actually for @xmath10 these single fermions arise also because we may no longer consider isolated dimers since they are too close , and we have actually to deal with a complicated many - body problem .",
    "however our point is that even the simplest minded description has to consider the energy dependence of scattering processes .",
    "actually it is possible to understand qualitatively the wide range of validity of the lee - huang - yang equation of state in the following way .",
    "one assumes first that only the s - wave scattering properties are relevant , since higher partial wave give a quite small contribution at low energy .",
    "then one supposes that the s - wave phase shift @xmath13 stays small enough so that its low energy expansion @xmath14 remains valid , where @xmath15 is the scattering length relevant for the considered process , dimer - dimer or fermion - dimer scattering . in this case",
    "the standard low energy expression for the scattering amplitude @xmath16 remains valid .",
    "this is what happens when the different fermions have equal masses . in this case",
    "the scattering amplitude has a fairly weak variation when @xmath17 is going from zero to the maximum value corresponding to dimer breaking , so the situation is not much different from evaluating the scattering amplitude at @xmath18 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that this simplicity is linked to the fact that the two atomic species have equal masses @xmath19 ( we follow the standard use of referring to the two different atomic species as @xmath20 and @xmath21 atoms , even if there is no relation between this notation and the physical spin of these atoms ) .",
    "it disappears when the masses are quite different . in this case , even though the elementary scattering process between different fermions is very simple to describe , nevertheless the mere complexity due to the existence of a dimer leads to complexity in the involved scattering processes . in the present paper",
    "we will consider only the simplest situation which displays such a feature .",
    "we will deal with the fermion - dimer scattering , not the dimer - dimer scattering .",
    "the lonely fermion has an @xmath20 spin and scatters with a @xmath20-@xmath21 dimer .",
    "we will furthermore assume that the available kinetic energy is small enough so the dimer is not broken by the collision . in other words",
    "we will deal only with elastic scattering .    in a first part of the paper we will consider s - wave scattering , since it is the dominant one at very low energy and",
    "is anyway expected to be an essential component of the scattering process .",
    "this is the natural extension of the case where the scattering is fully described by the scattering length .",
    "actually , although we have performed numerical calculations for any value of the mass ratio @xmath22 , we deal extensively with the limit where this mass ratio is large . indeed in this case",
    "we will be able to obtain an analytical solution of the problem , which has the advantage of displaying quite explicitly the behaviour resulting from the mass difference between the two fermion species .",
    "naturally since we have already explored in a preceding work @xcite the behaviour of the scattering length in this limit , this paper can also be seen as a natural extension of our earlier work . but",
    "it has the major interest of displaying a strong structure in the s - wave scattering amplitude , which is actually essentially linked to the increase of the scattering length with the mass ratio @xcite .",
    "then in the second part of our paper we will turn to p - wave scattering .",
    "although it does not contribute in the zero energy limit , this partial wave turns out to be quite important .",
    "this is physically linked to the appearance of new bound states which appear at the level of the three - body problem when the mass ratio increases .",
    "these bound states have been studied in great details by kartavtsev and malykh @xcite , for the present situation of two identical fermions with mass @xmath23 and a different fermion with mass @xmath24 .",
    "they are not present in the s - wave channel and appear only for angular momenta @xmath25 . among them",
    "are the well - known efimov @xcite states , which are quite remarkable for their spectrum structure with binding energy going up to infinity when the range of the interaction goes to zero . for @xmath26",
    "the efimov states appear only @xcite for a mass ratio @xmath27 . however there are already bound states for smaller mass ratios , which are not efimov states .",
    "a first bound state @xcite appears for mass ratio @xmath28 .",
    "actually very important contributions in the fermion - dimer scattering properties arise even for quite lower mass ratios .",
    "the basic reason is that , even before the mass ratio threshold for bound states is reached , virtual bound states are already present . for nonzero angular momenta , in particular @xmath29 ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier acts to inhibit their decay and provide them with fairly long lifetime",
    ". hence they are not much different from real bound states . moreover , since their energy is positive , they give rise to resonances , which are strong when they are located at low energy .",
    "in particular the p - wave contribution becomes very strong , due to quasi - resonance , when the mass ratio approaches @xmath30 .",
    "however we find that these effects are already important for the mass ratio @xmath31 corresponding to the mixtures of @xmath1li and @xmath0k , which is probably presently the most investigated experimentally@xcite and which is of very high current interest @xcite .",
    "actually this point has already been noted , for the specific case of the @xmath1li-@xmath0k mixtures , by levinsen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "this was mostly done for the case of narrow feshbach resonances , which are by far the most frequently found in these mixtures .",
    "they were also mostly interested in lower dimension physics .    here",
    "we will consider only the case of wide feshbach resonance in 3d , because of its theoretical interest due to its simplicity . in the following we will assume that we are near such a feshbach resonance and ignore any stability problem .",
    "fortunately such a feshbach resonance , which is fairly broad and reasonably stable , has been identified experimentally near @xmath32 g @xcite in @xmath1li-@xmath0k mixtures .",
    "we will consider in detail the mass ratio dependence of the p - wave contribution .",
    "this is not only of theoretical interest since we will show that , by making use of optical lattices , it is possible to vary experimentally the effective mass ratio of @xmath1li-@xmath0k mixtures .",
    "this would allow to study experimentally the effect of the p - wave contribution when it is quite strong , or conversely to eliminate it to a large extent which could be in particular be quite useful if this contribution turned out to be experimentally detrimental .",
    "we note indeed that these virtual bound states could play a very important role in the three - body decay and in the stability of these mixtures , since they correspond to physical situations where three atoms stay close together for a fairly long time , increasing in this way the probability of three - body decay processes . in this way",
    "optical lattices could also be used to study and possibly remove instability problems .    in this p - wave study",
    "we will consider mass ratios below the value @xmath30 , corresponding to the appearance of the first p - wave bound state , since clearly beyond this threshold the physical situation will get more complicated .",
    "this justifies also that we consider only the s - wave and p - wave components of the full scattering amplitude , since the higher angular momentum components are expected to give very small contributions to the total scattering in the regime we investigate .    in practice the next section [ swave ]",
    "is devoted to the study of the s - wave contribution to the scattering amplitude .",
    "but in the first subsection we will present the basic general equations which will be used also for the p - wave contribution . then in the rest of this next section [ swave ] we will study analytically in details the case where the mass ratio @xmath33 is very large .",
    "we will conclude this section by considering numerically cases where this mass ratio corresponds to situations which can be reached experimentally .",
    "then in the last section [ pwav ] before our conclusion we study numerically the p - wave contribution .",
    "in the same way as in our earlier work @xcite we use the integral equation formulation of this dimer - fermion scattering problem first worked out by skorniakov and ter - martirosian@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to derive it rapidly in the case where the fermion masses are different @xcite by writing directly @xcite the integral equation satisfied by the full dimer - fermion scattering vertex @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the ( conserved ) momentum - energy of the particles @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the total momentum and @xmath38 the total energy of incoming particles .",
    "@xmath39 is the momentum - energy of the incoming @xmath20 fermion and @xmath40 its outgoing value .",
    "since we want the dimer - fermion scattering amplitude , we can take the center of mass referential for which @xmath41 .",
    "if we call @xmath42 the outgoing momentum of the @xmath20 fermion , i.e. @xmath43 , the total energy @xmath38 is the sum of the binding energy of the dimer and of the kinetic energies of the outgoing particles : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dimer reduced mass , @xmath46 is the atom - dimer reduced mass @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the mass of the dimer .",
    "the integral equation satisfied by @xmath34 is @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 is the dimer propagator : @xmath53 while @xmath54 are the single fermion @xmath20 or @xmath21 propagators .",
    "just as in the equal mass case @xcite one can show that , in the right - hand side of eq.([3vertex ] ) , only the on - the - shell value of @xmath55 with respect to the variable @xmath56 is needed .",
    "hence we may restrict ourselves to consider only this on - the - shell value everywhere in eq.([3vertex ] ) .",
    "finally we have also to take the on - the - shell value for @xmath57 to obtain the scattering amplitude , which means @xmath58 .",
    "we are thus led to consider more specifically @xmath59 and the scattering amplitude will be obtained by taking @xmath60 . hence we introduce , instead of @xmath34 , a function @xmath61 which is directly related to the scattering amplitude , as we will see below @xcite : @xmath62    t_3 ( \\{\\textbf{k},k^2/2 m { _ { \\uparrow}}\\},\\{\\textbf{k}_0,k_0 ^ 2/2 m { _ { \\uparrow}}\\};\\{{\\bf 0},e\\})\\ ] ]    in this part we are only interested in the s - wave component of the scattering amplitude .",
    "this component is obtained from the above @xmath63 by averaging it over the angle between the incoming momentum @xmath64 and the outgoing one @xmath42 , and we note @xmath65 the resulting angular average .",
    "noting merely @xmath66 the corresponding average on @xmath61 ( naturally @xmath66 still depends on @xmath67 ) , we see that it is simply given by eq.([defa3 ] ) where @xmath63 has been replaced by @xmath65 . obviously when we take the angular average of integral equation eq.([3vertex ] ) , we are left with an integral equation involving only @xmath65 , or equivalently @xmath68 .",
    "it is more convenient to write the resulting integral equation by making use of reduced units , obtained by setting @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath73 where we have used for the involved mass ratios the simpler notations @xmath74 , @xmath75 . in writing this equation",
    "we have used the fact that we consider only the case where the incoming dimer and fermion have kinetic energies low enough so that the dimer can not be broken in the scattering process .",
    "this implies that @xmath76 , or @xmath77 in our reduced units .",
    "this makes all the arguments in the logarithms positive .",
    "otherwise we should have included @xmath78 contributions in these arguments . in the case",
    "where @xmath79 one checks easily that this equation reduces to the one studied in @xcite , which gives the scattering length for the same process .",
    "it is clear that @xmath80 is a complex quantity . from eq.([eqa3bar ] ) one can write the coupled integral equations for its real and imaginary parts , which are convenient for the numerical solution of eq.([eqa3bar ] ) . in the case where the masses are equal @xmath81 one can check that the resulting equations are identical to the ones obtained by skorniakov and ter - martirosian@xcite for this specific case .",
    "finally it is convenient to consider the relation between @xmath61 and the wave function @xmath82 for the dimer - fermion scattering problem , as it is found in @xcite and @xcite . for large dimer - fermion distance",
    "@xmath83 it behaves as : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the angle between the incoming fermion momentum @xmath64 and its outgoing value @xmath42 ( with @xmath86 ) , and @xmath87 is the scattering amplitude .",
    "its fourier transform reads : @xmath88 note that the second term has a sign opposite to the one found in @xcite , just because our definition for @xmath68 has an opposite sign .",
    "the scattering amplitude is obtained from @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) .    when one takes the angular average of eq.([wavef ] ) , the resulting s - wave component @xmath91 of the wave function is given by : @xmath92 where @xmath13 is the s - wave phase shift , linked to s - wave component @xmath93 of the scattering amplitude by : @xmath94      let us go now to the interesting regime where the mass of the lonely fermion @xmath24 is very light ( or equivalently the mass @xmath23 of the two identical fermions is very heavy ) .",
    "in this case parameter @xmath95 is near zero and @xmath96 is near @xmath97 . in our preceding paper @xcite , where we had @xmath98 ,",
    "we have carefully expanded eq.([eqa3bar ] ) near this limit .",
    "then by a fourier transform we have converted the resulting equation into a differential equation with respect to a variable which is called @xmath99 below .",
    "we have studied this last equation , matching in particular the behaviour for the small and the large values of the variable @xmath99 by appropriate consideration of the boundary conditions .",
    "however the important range , in order to obtain the scattering length , corresponds to the large @xmath99 values and the proper behaviour in this range can also be obtained from physical considerations , as we will see below .",
    "we can also proceed by continuity , requiring that in the present case the large variable @xmath100 behaviour reduces to the one we have found in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "more specifically we have seen in this preceding work that the careful expansion of the right - hand side of eq.([eqa3bar ] ) was useful only to satisfy the perfect matching with the boundary conditions for the small values of the variable @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand only the expansion of the left - hand side of eq.([eqa3bar ] ) was necessary in order to obtain the large @xmath99 information necessary to obtain the scattering length . here",
    "we will take advantage of this fact to avoid the painfull task of expanding the right - hand side of eq.([eqa3bar ] ) and rather rely on the above arguments to obtain the required large variable @xmath99 behaviour .",
    "hence we will set @xmath95 and @xmath96 to their limiting value , namely @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the right - hand side .",
    "in the left - hand side , following our preceding work , we will also set @xmath103 because large values of @xmath104 are irrelevant in our problem .",
    "however we will naturally keep the overall factor @xmath95 in front of the left - hand side .",
    "this is the only difference with taking the full @xmath105 limit .",
    "we rewrite eq.([eqa3bar ] ) in this limit by making use , instead of @xmath106 , of the more convenient function @xmath107 defined by : @xmath108 we note that , since from eq.([eqa3bar ] ) @xmath106 is an even function of @xmath109 , @xmath107 is an odd function of @xmath109",
    ". then eq.([eqa3bar ] ) becomes : @xmath110 where in the last equality we have made use of the odd parity of @xmath107 and , as in @xcite , we have set : @xmath111    we take now the fourier transform of this equation , introducing : @xmath112 and making use of : @xmath113 where we have restricted ourselves to the case @xmath114 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath115 since the @xmath116 solution : @xmath117 satisfies @xmath118 , it is convenient to set : @xmath119 to obtain the simpler equation : @xmath120 the fact that we find a second order differential equation is directly related to our lowest order expansion of eq.([eqa3bar ] ) in @xmath121 .",
    "going to higher order in this expansion would result in a higher order differential equation    at this stage it is useful to notice the relation between @xmath122 and the scattering wavefunction eq.([waves ] ) .",
    "taking in eq.([tf ] ) the angular average over the direction of @xmath64 , performing the angular integration over @xmath83 , setting @xmath86 and making use of the definition eq.([deff ] ) , we obtain : @xmath123 -4\\pi f(q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have added in the right - hand side the term @xmath124 which is usely zero since @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "however we have extended above the range of variation of @xmath56 to negative values and made use of the fact that the corresponding extension of @xmath127 is odd .",
    "the added term is necessary to satisfy in eq.([angav ] ) this parity property of @xmath127 .",
    "going to reduced variables and taking the fourier transform of eq.([angav ] ) for @xmath128 we obtain with eq.([f0 ] ) : @xmath129 hence from eq.([defg ] ) we have for large @xmath99 the very simple relation : @xmath130 this provides us with the boundary condition necessary to solve the second order differential equation eq.([eqg1 ] ) , which is accordingly an effective schrdinger equation for our scattering problem .    except for the @xmath131 term this equation eq.([eqg1 ] ) is the same as the one we have found in our preceding work @xcite and we solve it by following the same procedure . performing the change of variable @xmath132 , implying @xmath133 , we find that @xmath134 satisfies : @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "we notice again that , in the range of variable which is of interest , that is large @xmath137 , corresponding to small @xmath138 , @xmath139 is a quite slowly varying function of @xmath138 .",
    "this allows to treat it as a constant @xmath140 . as discussed in details in @xcite",
    "this approximate treatment is increasingly accurate when the mass ratio @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath142 , becomes increasingly small , which is precisely the limit we are interested in .",
    "we have found @xcite that the important range for matching the solution of eq.([eqg1 ] ) to the asymptotic behaviour , in the present case eq.([gasymp ] ) , is @xmath143 .",
    "hence we may take @xmath144",
    ".    then the further change of variable @xmath145 transforms eq.([eqgz ] ) into : @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "the solution of this equation which matches , as we will see shortly , the asymptotic behaviour eq.([gasymp ] ) is @xcite the well known bessel functions @xmath148 ( or equivalently @xmath149 ) , which goes continuously to the solution @xmath150 that we have found in @xcite for the case @xmath151 . a convenient integral representation for this function is @xcite : @xmath152 from this representation one obtains the small @xmath153 behaviour : @xmath154\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the euler function .",
    "from this result one recovers in particular , for @xmath156 , the known small @xmath153 asymptotic behaviour @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the euler constant .",
    "since @xmath159 we see that , for large @xmath99 , our solution has indeed the required asymptotic behaviour eq.([gasymp ] ) .",
    "this is naturally within an unimportant constant prefactor since the homogeneous differential equation eq.([eqgx ] ) does not allow to find this prefactor .",
    "but , as soon as @xmath160 is found , this prefactor is given explicitly by eq.([gasymp ] ) .",
    "comparing eq.([smalx ] ) with eq.([gasymp ] ) in order to identify the phase shift , we find easily : @xmath161=\\bar{k}_0 \\ln\\left[\\epsilon ^2 \\ln ( 1/\\epsilon ^2)\\right]+{\\rm arg}\\left[i\\gamma(2i\\bar{k}_0)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular in the limit @xmath162 we can make use of @xmath163 , implying @xmath164 \\simeq -2\\bar{k}_0c$ ] . comparing to the limiting behaviour @xmath165 we recover our result @xcite : @xmath166 for the fermion - dimer scattering length in the considered limit where the mass ratio @xmath167 is large .",
    "once the phase shift is known we obtain the scattering amplitude by merely making use of eq.([scattamp ] ) .",
    "this is obviously the simpler way .",
    "however let us briefly show that we recover this result by calculating directly @xmath168 from our solution @xmath148 of eq.([eqgx ] ) .",
    "from section [ base ] we have : @xmath169 the last equality resulting from eq.([deff ] ) . in the fourier transform of the decomposition eq.([defg ] ) we see that @xmath170 does not contribute to the right - hand side of eq.([f0 ] ) since , as we have seen in eq.([angav ] ) : @xmath171\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that , in this right - hand side , we are left only with the contribution of @xmath172 : @xmath173    we have seen that the solution of eq.([eqgx ] ) is proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "going back to the @xmath99 variable this translates into : @xmath174 where , as mentionned above , the prefactor @xmath175 can not be obtained from the homogeneous equation eq.([eqgx ] ) and has to be determined from the asymptotic behaviour eq.([gasymp ] ) for @xmath122 . from the asymptotic behaviour eq.([smalx ] ) we have : @xmath176 where @xmath160 is given by eq.([delta0 ] ) . comparing eq.([eqgr ] ) with eq.([gasymp ] ) we find : @xmath177",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath122 is then : @xmath178 where we have made use of the odd parity of @xmath122 directly linked to the odd parity of @xmath107 .",
    "going back to the variable @xmath179 we have : @xmath180 where in the last step we have replaced the upper bound @xmath181 by @xmath182 , since in our case @xmath183 and , as it is clear from eq.([repr ] ) , @xmath148 decreases exponentially rapidly for large @xmath153 .",
    "the last integral can be performed analytically @xcite , leading to : @xmath184 since @xmath185 for @xmath186 , we find from eq.([f0bis ] ) and eq.([tffin ] ) : @xmath187\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however we have from eq.([delta0 ] ) : @xmath188 taking eq.([alpha ] ) into account this leads to : @xmath189 which , when we go back to unreduced units , is identical to eq.([scattamp ] ) as it should be .",
    "this shows that our calculations and approximations in the very light mass limit are fully consistent .",
    "let us now consider the implications of our result eq.([delta0 ] ) for the phase shift and the corresponding scattering amplitude .",
    "although the euler @xmath190 function is easily obtained numerically , we have more insight if we make use of an excellent approximation .",
    "since for real @xmath153 we have : @xmath191={\\rm arg}\\left[ix\\gamma(ix)\\right]={\\rm arg}\\left[\\gamma(1+ix)\\right ] = { \\rm im}\\left[\\ln\\gamma(1+ix)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may use the excellent stirling formula @xmath192 which leads to : @xmath193",
    "if we were to correct the small imperfection of the stirling formula for low @xmath138 by replacing @xmath194 by @xmath195 , this would allow eq.([delta01 ] ) to give the exact result @xmath196 with @xmath197 given by eq.([a3 ] ) , but the result would not be accurate for higher values of @xmath198 .",
    "our original result eq.([delta0 ] ) and its simplified form eq.([delta01 ] ) are displayed in fig.[fig1s ] for @xmath199 and @xmath200 . in this last case",
    "the two results are essentially undistinguishable in the figure .",
    "we can see that @xmath201 displays first a strong decrease from zero down to large negative values after which it increases back to small negative values , and even becomes positive in the case of large mass ratios . for large @xmath197 approximate analytical results",
    "may be obtained for the location of the minimum and its value .",
    "they both scale as @xmath202 . the essential qualitative feature of this result , namely the strong decrease of the phase shift , is directly linked to the large positive value of the scattering length . for example",
    "it is qualitatively fairly analogous to the one found for the @xmath203 phase shift of a square repulsive potential with strength @xmath204 and range @xmath95 , which is given by : @xmath205\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is related to the energy @xmath38 by @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "this is plotted in fig.[fig2s ] for @xmath208 .",
    "we consider now the consequences of the above result for the s - wave scattering amplitude which is obtained from eq.([scattamp ] ) .",
    "we are mostly interested in its modulus @xmath209 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3s ] for @xmath210 .",
    "the very interesting feature is the existence of several zeros occuring when @xmath211 .",
    "the first few zeros are merely located at @xmath212 . physically these zeros imply that there is no contribution from s - wave scattering to the total cross section .",
    "we see also that the scattering amplitude is strongly peaked for zero energy , a feature which is even more important for the corresponding contribution @xmath213 to the cross section .",
    "this feature is clearly linked to the strong decrease of the phase shift when @xmath198 starts from zero . as mentionned above this",
    "is directly linked to the large value of the scattering length , and consequently this is clearly not an artefact of our approximate treatment .",
    "this behaviour implies that a rough model for the s - wave component of the effective fermion - dimer interaction could be a constant up to the energy @xmath214 followed by no interaction at all for higher relative kinetic energy .",
    "this is quite different from the simple picture of a constant interaction , whatever the energy , which is valid for example when the fermions have equal masses .",
    "these results we have obtained appear quite naturally in the small @xmath141 limit .",
    "their qualitative features are interesting enough to check that they are not just a curiosity of this simple , but not so physical , limit and that they rather stay valid qualitatively in the physical range for atomic mass ratios .",
    "we have checked that our result is in semiquantitative agreement with the exact numerical result from eq.([eqa3bar ] ) .",
    "this is displayed first for @xmath210 which is somewhat beyond realistic values .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig3s ] that our approximation is in fair agreement with the exact one for reasonably small energies ( the discrepancy at and near zero energy is just due to the difference between our approximate value for the scattering length and the exact one ) .",
    "there is however an increasing disagreement for higher values of the energy , which is not so surprising .",
    "our approximate phase shift is varying with energy somewhat less rapidly than the exact one .",
    "if we go now to the more realistic value corresponding to a hypothetical mixture of @xmath1li and @xmath215yb displaying a feshbach resonance , we obtain for this mass ratio @xmath216 the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fig4s ] .",
    "it is quite interesting to see that the results are not deeply modified compared to the low energy part of the preceding figure .",
    "both the approximate and the exact result display a single zero .",
    "just as in the preceding case , the exact zero is at a somewhat lower energy than what our approximate analytical expression gives .",
    "it is interesting that the relative location of this zero is in this order .",
    "indeed our figure shows that the approximate zero is near the dissociation threshold of the dimer , and that it is no longer present for slightly lower values of the mass ratio @xmath22 . on the other hand",
    "the exact zero is only halfway to the dissociation threshold .",
    "since the existence of this zero is a landmark of a strongly varying s - wave scattering amplitude , it is of high interest that it exists for even lower , and accordingly more realistic , mass ratio @xmath22 .",
    "we have found specifically that the exact zero is disappearing for @xmath217 .",
    "if we take the lighter fermion to be @xmath1li , this would imply for the heavier one a mass quite near the one of rubidium .",
    "unfortunately the two stable isotopes of rubidium are bosonic , but there are two fermionic ones , @xmath218rb and @xmath219rb , which have half - life of order of a month . finally if we take the case of the @xmath1li - @xmath0k mixture , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5s ] , we see that the scattering cross section ( obtained by squaring the amplitude ) near the dissociation threshold is only 5% of its zero energy value .",
    "finally it is worth noting that the disappearance of this zero in the scattering amplitude when the mass ratio is lowered is strikingly similar to the same disappearance @xcite in the function @xmath220 , which comes in the calculation of the scattering length @xmath68 . in this last case",
    "the disappearance occurs at a somewhat lower value of the mass ratio , and @xmath220 has no simple physical meaning , which makes the interpretation difficult .",
    "however one could go continuously from this function to the scattering amplitude by varying the last parameter from @xmath221 to @xmath64 .",
    "hence the two functions are closely related , and the simple physical explanation for the zero in the scattering amplitude ( it occurs when the phase shift reaches @xmath222 ) gives a corresponding understanding for @xmath220 .",
    "we turn now to the p - wave contribution to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the analysis is done with the skorniakov and ter - martirosian equations as detailed in section [ base ] .",
    "the only difference is that , instead of averaging eq.([defa3 ] ) to obtain the s - wave component , in order to obtain the p - wave component @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the @xmath29 legendre polynomial , we have to project on this @xmath29 legendre polynomial .",
    "the resulting equation is quite similar to the s - wave one eq.([eqa3bar ] ) .",
    "this is seen quite clearly by introducing the notations ( making again use of reduced variables , but omitting systematically the bar over quantities in reduced units ) : @xmath225 and defining the kernels : @xmath226 and @xmath227 then the equations for the s - wave and p - wave components can be written : @xmath228 where @xmath229 used in section [ swave ] .",
    "since we are interested in this part in mass ratios smaller than in the preceding section [ swave ] , we provide first the results for the s - wave component for the specific mass ratios of interest .",
    "the results for @xmath230 in terms of @xmath231 are given in fig.[fig1 ] , for the mass ratios @xmath232 .",
    "we have also inserted the result for @xmath233 corresponding to the @xmath1li - @xmath0k mixture , already displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5s ] . except for the fairly slow increase of the atom - dimer scattering length with the mass ratio found at @xmath234 , all the results are of order unity for @xmath235 and keep decreasing for increasing @xmath231 .",
    "we turn now to the p - wave component results .",
    "we first give in fig.[fig2 ] the results for mass ratios @xmath236 and @xmath237 , stopping at the value corresponding to the @xmath1li - @xmath0k mixture .",
    "for equal masses the p - wave component is always small , as it could be expected , and it can clearly be omitted when one deals with the atom - dimer scattering properties .",
    "hence the atom - dimer vertex can , to a large extent , be taken as a constant proportional to the atom - dimer scattering length .",
    "no complication is thus expected to arise from this side when many - body properties will be investigated .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar for @xmath238 and even @xmath239 : the p - wave component is fairly small and can be neglected compared to the s - wave contribution .",
    "however , we see that this p - wave component rises steeply when the mass ratio goes from @xmath239 to @xmath237 .",
    "this last ratio is at the border of the resonant domain .",
    "this domain is now displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the results for mass ratios @xmath240 and @xmath241 are plotted .",
    "we see that the hump , present for @xmath233 around @xmath242 , develops into a strong resonance at lower and lower energy when @xmath167 is increased .",
    "although we have sampled mass ratios which are very close to each other , we see that the resonance grows very rapidly with increasing mass ratio .",
    "the physical origin is clearly the development of a virtual bound state at positive energy .",
    "the lifetime of this state is directly related to the width of the resonance .",
    "since the resonance peak gets quickly narrower , the lifetime grows very rapidly with increasing mass .",
    "the link with the bound state which appears @xcite at zero energy for @xmath243 is confirmed if we look at the position of the resonance peak as a function of the mass ratio .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "we see that the position @xmath244 of the resonance peak extrapolates to zero for a mass ratio which is in close vicinity of @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely when the resonance peak reaches @xmath245 , it will be infinitely sharp , corresponding to an infinite value for @xmath246 .",
    "hence in this case @xmath247 will be infinitely large , which implies that the homogeneous eq.([inteq ] ) ( i.e. without the term @xmath248 in the right - hand side ) has a solution for zero energy @xmath234 .",
    "this is just stating the well - known result that bound states are solutions of the homogeneous integral equation corresponding to eq.([inteq ] ) .",
    "it is easy to find the lowest @xmath167 for which this homogeneous integral equation has a solution .",
    "we find that this occurs for @xmath249 in full agreement with kartavtsev and malykh @xcite .",
    "let us now come to the total scattering cross section @xmath250 , which is likely to be the easiest direct physical quantity to measure experimentally .",
    "since we neglect angular momenta higher than @xmath29 , we have for this cross section : @xmath251 the result is plotted in fig.[fig5 ] for @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "we see that , while up to @xmath252 , the cross section is almost featureless , it display a strong resonance for @xmath233 which corresponds to the experimental value for @xmath1li - @xmath0k mixture .",
    "naturally when the mass ratio is further increased , this resonance becomes even stronger .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5bis ] where we display also the case of @xmath253 .",
    "the resulting resonance dwarfs the preceding one .",
    "this strong resonance in the atom - dimer scattering cross section for @xmath1li - @xmath0k mixtures should imply a number of experimentally observable consequences . the more natural way to evidence it would be to measure the collision properties between a @xmath0k cloud and a @xmath0k -@xmath1li dimer cloud , in a way analogous to the recent experiments on @xmath1li for spin states @xcite .",
    "however this might not be so easy to perform .",
    "measuring the equation of state of a mixture is on the other hand a fundamental question which should be easier to answer .",
    "the resonance should affect in an important way the low temperature equation of state of a mixture of @xmath0k cloud and a @xmath0k -@xmath1li dimer , arising from an unbalanced mixture of @xmath0k and @xmath1li atoms on the bec side of the feshbach resonance .",
    "this will not appear at the mean field level since the angular average will cancel the effect because this is a p - wave resonance .",
    "but going to next order in @xmath0k , analogously to second order perturbation theory , there will be no cancellation .",
    "hence one should see a strong dependence on the @xmath0k density .",
    "one expects also a strong density dependence to arise when the fermi wavevector of the @xmath0k fermi sea reaches the wavevector corresponding to the resonance , since for lower wavevectors the scattering is essentially negligible .",
    "one should see something similar to a threshold effect in density .",
    "we note that the resonance should also have an important effect even on a balanced mixture of @xmath0k and @xmath1li , on the bec side , when the temperature is raised",
    ". indeed the dimers will be partially broken by thermal excitation which provides a natural source of free @xmath0k atoms , and effects analogous to the ones arising in the unbalanced mixture .",
    "similarly , going to high temperature , we expect this resonance to have a marked effect on the virial coefficients since these are systematically related to the three - body problem @xcite .",
    "naturally the resonance is also expected to affect strongly the transport properties .",
    "both the effects on the equation of state and on the transport properties should appear in the frequency and the damping of the collective modes @xcite .    another way to understand",
    "the effect of this resonance on the @xmath1li - @xmath0k mixtures is to remark that the long lived virtual bound states responsible for it should behave in many respects in a way analogous to real bound states , as it has already been noted by levinsen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "hence on the bec side the physical description should involve not only free fermions and dimers , but also the existence of trimers .",
    "obviously all the physical properties should be affected by the presence of this additional fermion species .",
    "a related point is that the existence of these trimers should affect the dimer - dimer scattering properties . in other words",
    "we have only explored the simpler fermion - dimer scattering properties , but we expect that the dimer - dimer scattering amplitude will display related energy structure , and they should not be so complicated to explore with the methods of our preceding work @xcite .    finally it is worth stressing that the use of optical lattices should provide a very convenient and powerful way to explore the resonance we have pointed out .",
    "indeed the natural mass ratio of @xmath237 between @xmath0k and @xmath1li atoms happens to be just at the border of the strongly resonating mass ratio domain .",
    "a rather weak optical lattice could be used to slightly tune the effective mass of @xmath0k or @xmath1li ( by making an appropriate choice of the light frequency , only one atomic species is affected ) , producing strong modification of the resonance and hence of the physical properties of the mixture .",
    "in this way one could go into the strongly resonating domain , or even reach the threshold for the appearance of real bound states . or one could go in the other direction and basically get rid of the resonance , which would allow to prove that it is responsible for specific physical properties of the mixture .",
    "more specifically the 3d potential @xmath254 $ ] with @xmath255 provides , within second order perturbation theory , an effective @xmath256 given by @xmath257 .",
    "increasing the @xmath0k effective mass to reach the bound state ratio @xmath258 requires @xmath259 which corresponds to a fairly weak optical potential .",
    "this simple picture of effective mass modification works only if the size of the involved objects ( dimer , trimer ) is large compared to the optical wavelength @xmath260 .",
    "taking @xmath261 this should be a valid approximation in the vicinity of the feshbach resonance , where the scattering length becomes quite large .",
    "even if corrections to this simple picture are necessary , the qualitative physical trends should remain valid .",
    "in this paper we have studied the s - wave and p - wave contributions to the fermion - dimer scattering amplitude as a function of the mass ratio .",
    "when masses are equal the physical situation is quite simple .",
    "the p - wave contribution is completely negligible , and the modulus of the s - wave contribution is essentially constant .",
    "hence the energy dependence of the scattering properties is inessential , and the fermion - dimer scattering length @xmath68 is enough to fully characterize these properties .",
    "when the mass ratio is increased the situation becomes much more complex , both for s - wave and for p - wave .",
    "for the s - wave contribution we have obtained an analytical solution in the asymptotic limit of very large mass ratio .",
    "this allows to have explicitly the behaviour of the s - wave scattering amplitude .",
    "we find that it displays a large number of zeros .",
    "these are directly linked to the very rapid increase of the phase shift with energy , a zero appearing each time the phase shift crosses a multiple of @xmath222 . at low energy",
    "this rapid increase of the phase shift is directly linked to the known large value of the fermion - dimer scattering length for large mass ratio , although we find that at higher energy the phase shift saturates and goes back toward zero . in the range of mass ratio corresponding to possible experimental situations ,",
    "the numerical solutions display a behaviour in qualitative agreement with the asymptotic limit , although the agreement is not quantitative which is not surprising .",
    "interestingly we find that a zero is still present in the s - wave scattering amplitude down to an experimentally reasonable mass ratio of @xmath262 .    for the p - wave contribution the behaviour gets rapidly quite complex as soon as the mass ratio has a sizeable value .",
    "this is basically due to the appearance of a fermion - dimer bound state when the mass ratio reaches the value @xmath263 , and we have limited our study to mass ratios below this threshold . even below this threshold",
    "the existence of the bound state appears through the existence of virtual bound states at positive energy .",
    "these give rise to a resonance in the scattering amplitude .",
    "this resonance gets stronger and goes to lower energy when the mass ratio is increased toward the limiting value of @xmath263 , at which the resonance corresponds to a divergence at zero energy .",
    "it is very interesting that the mass ratio @xmath264 , corresponding to the @xmath0k - @xmath1li mixtures , much studied experimentally , is at the border where the p - wave resonance becomes important .",
    "roughly , below this mass ratio we find a fairly small bump in the modulus of the p - wave scattering amplitude , which is fairly unimportant in the overall scattering properties and may be omitted in a first approach . on the other hand",
    "above this mass ratio , the p - wave resonance grows very rapidly and becomes the dominant feature of the scattering .",
    "we have stressed explicitly that the use of optical lattices could allow to vary experimentally the mass ratio throughout this very interesting range of mass ratio .",
    "one could in this way disentangle the role of this p - wave resonance in the physical properties of these @xmath0k - @xmath1li mixtures , which are likely to be quite complex . in the same way one could check if these virtual bound states play an important role in the instabilities of these mixtures .",
