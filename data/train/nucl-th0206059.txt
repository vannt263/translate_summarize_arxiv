    "many properties of the nuclear states can be described within the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . among many microscopic nuclear models aiming at a description of the properties of nuclear excitations",
    "the most consistent model employs an effective interaction which can describe , throughout the periodic table , the ground states in the framework of the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation and the excited states in the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent hf , or the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the gogny s interaction@xcite and the skyrme - type interactions@xcite are very popular now .",
    "such models are quite successful not only for predicting accurately nuclear ground state properties@xcite but also for calculating the main features of giant resonances in closed - shell nuclei@xcite and single - particle strengths near closed shells@xcite .",
    "taking into account the pairing effects enables one to reproduce also many properties of collective states in open - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is well known that due to the anharmonicity of vibrations there is a coupling between one - phonon and more complex states @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is that the complexity of calculations beyond standard rpa ( e.g. , for studying damping mechanisms of collective excitations ) increases rapidly with the size of the configuration space and one has to work within limited spaces . from another point of view",
    "more phenomenological models that assume some simple separable form for the residual nucleon - nucleon interaction while the mean field is modelized by an empirical potential well allow one to calculate nuclear excitations in very large configuration spaces since there is no need to diagonalize matrices whose dimensions grow with the size of configuration space .",
    "the well - known quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) of soloviev et al.@xcite belongs to such a model .",
    "very detailed predictions can be made by qpm for nuclei away from closed shells@xcite .    the possibility to solve easily the rpa problem in a large configuration space when the residual particle - hole ( p - h ) interaction is separable was the motivation for proposing in our previous work @xcite a finite rank approximation for the p - h interaction resulting from skyrme - type forces .",
    "thus , the self - consistent mean field can be calculated in the standard way with the original skyrme interaction whereas the rpa solutions would be obtained with the finite rank approximation to the p - h matrix elements . it was found that the finite rank approximation reproduces reasonably well the dipole and quadrupole strength distributions in ar isotopes .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the finite rank rpa calculations to take into account pairing effects . as an application we present results of calculations for low - lying @xmath0 and @xmath1 states in some o , ar , sn and pb isotopes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we sketch our method for constructing a finite rank interaction for the quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) case . in section iii",
    "we discuss details of calculations and show how this approach can be applied to treat different multipole states in wide excitation energy regions .",
    "results of calculations for characteristics of the quadrupole and octupole states in some nuclei are given in section iv .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  v.",
    "we start from the effective skyrme interaction@xcite and use the notation of ref.@xcite containing explicit density dependence and all spin - exchange terms rather than the original form of ref@xcite where density dependence at the hf level was introduced by a three - body contact force and where some spin - exchange terms were dropped .",
    "the exact p - h residual interaction @xmath2 corresponding to the skyrme force and including both direct and exchange terms can be obtained as the second derivative of the energy density functional with respect to the density@xcite .",
    "following our previous paper@xcite we simplify @xmath2 by approximating it by its landau - migdal form in the momentum space :    @xmath3 p_l(\\frac{{\\bf   k}_1 \\cdot{\\bf k}_2}{k_f^2 } ) , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the nucleon momentum , spin and isospin operators , and + @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 standing for the fermi momentum and nucleon effective mass .",
    "for skyrme interactions all landau parameters with @xmath10 are zero . here",
    ", we keep only the @xmath11 terms in @xmath12 and in the coordinate representation one can write it in the following form :    @xmath13 \\delta ( { \\bf r}_1-{\\bf r } _ 2 )   \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expressions for @xmath14 in terms of the skyrme force parameters can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "because of the density dependence of the interaction the landau parameters of eq.([eq2 ] ) are functions of the coordinate @xmath15 . in what follows we use the second quantized representation and @xmath12",
    "can be written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the particle creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath19 denotes the quantum numbers @xmath20 ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the above equation , @xmath25 is the reduced matrix element of the spherical harmonics @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28_{j}^{m}$ ] and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the radial integrals :    @xmath31    @xmath32    where the radial wave functions @xmath33 are related to the hf single - particle wave functions : @xmath34    as it is shown in @xcite the radial integrals can be calculated accurately by choosing a large enough cutoff radius @xmath35 and using a @xmath36-point integration gauss formula with abscissas and weights @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the residual interaction can be presented as a sum of @xmath36 separable terms .",
    "so we employ the hamiltonian including an average nuclear hf field , pairing interactions , the isoscalar and isovector particle  hole ( p  h ) residual forces in a finite rank @xmath36 :    @xmath38 \\right ) \\label{eq9},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we sum over the proton(@xmath39 ) and neutron(@xmath40 ) indexes and the notation @xmath41 is used .",
    "a change @xmath42 means a change @xmath43 .",
    "the single - particle states are specified by the quantum numbers @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the single - particle energies , @xmath46 the chemical potentials .",
    "@xmath47 is the interaction strength in the particle - particle channel , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are the multipole ( spin - multipole ) interaction strengths in the p  h channel and they can be expressed via the landau parameters as :    @xmath50    the monopole pair creation , the multipole and spin - multipole operators entering the normal products in eq.([eq9 ] ) are defined as follows :    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 are the single particle radial matrix elements of the multipole and spin - multipole operators :    @xmath55    @xmath56    one can see that the hamiltonian ( [ eq9 ] ) has the same form as the qpm hamiltonian with @xmath57 separable terms , but in contrast to the qpm all parameters of this hamiltonian are expressed through parameters of the skyrme forces .    in what follows we work in the quasiparticle representation defined by the canonical bogoliubov transformation : @xmath58 the hamiltonian ( [ eq9 ] ) can be represented in terms of bifermion quasiparticle operators and their conjugates @xcite : @xmath59",
    "@xmath60 we introduce the phonon creation operators @xmath61 where the index @xmath62 denotes total angular momentum and @xmath63 is its z - projection in the laboratory system .",

    "one can find a prescription how to solve this system and to find the eigen - energies and phonon amplitudes in appendix a ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the matrix dimensions never exceed @xmath80 independently of the configuration space size .",
    "the derived equations have the same form as the qrpa equations in the qpm @xcite , but the single - particle spectrum and parameters of the p - h residual interaction are calculated making use of the skyrme forces .",
    "in this work we use generally the standard parametrization siii @xcite of the skyrme force .",
    "some examples of calculations with other parameter sets are presented in the next section .",
    "spherical symmetry is assumed for the hf ground states .",
    "the pairing constants @xmath81 are fixed to reproduce the odd - even mass difference of neighboring nuclei . as a result",
    "constant pairing gaps have values that are very close to @xmath82 besides a case of semimagic nuclei .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the constant gap approximation leads to an overestimating of occupation probabilities for subshells that are far from the fermi level and it is necessary to introduce a cut - off in the single - particle space . above this cut - off subshells do nt participate in the pairing effect . in our calculations",
    "we choose the bcs subspace to include all subshells lying below 5 mev . in order to perform rpa calculations ,",
    "the single - particle continuum is discretized @xcite by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on a basis of twelve harmonic oscillator shells and cutting off the single - particle spectra at the energy of 190 mev .",
    "this is sufficient to exhaust practically all the energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "as it was shown in our previous calculations @xcite we have adopted the value @xmath36=24 for the finite rank approximation for the dipole and quadrupole excitations in ar isotopes . increasing the mass number and the multipolarity of excitations demands an increase of the rank to keep the calculations accurate .",
    "our investigations enable us to conclude that @xmath36=45 is enough for multipolarities @xmath83 in nuclei with @xmath84 .",
    "increasing @xmath36 , for example , up to @xmath36=60 in @xmath85pb changes results for energies and transition probabilities not more than by 1% , so all calculations in what follows have been done with @xmath36=45 .",
    "our calculations show that , for the normal parity states one can neglect the spin - multipole interactions as a rule and this reduces by a factor 2 the total matrix dimension .",
    "for example , for the octupole excitations in @xmath86pb we need to invert a matrix having a dimension 2n=90 instead of diagonalizing a @xmath87 matrix as it would be without the finite rank approximation . for light nuclei",
    "the reduction of matrix dimensions due to the finite rank approximation is 3 or 4 .",
    "so , for heavy nuclei our approach gives a large gain in comparison with an exact diagonalization .",
    "the landau parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 expressed in terms of the skyrme force parameters @xcite depend on @xmath8 .",
    "as it is pointed out in our previous work @xcite one needs to adopt some effective value for @xmath8 to give an accurate representation of the original p - h skyrme interaction . to fix the effective values of @xmath8 for the landau parameters we use the self - consistency relation @xcite . from the following set of equations : @xmath92 @xmath93 one can get the average field potential corresponding to such a choice of the residual interaction : @xmath94    this potential can be compared to @xmath95 which is the leader term of a local equivalent potential in skyrme - hf approach .",
    "it is possible to evaluate the effective value @xmath8 for every nucleus .",
    "one can show that this value is larger than the nuclear matter value in order to compensate for the effects of the neglected terms @xmath96 and @xmath97 . to calculate the dipole strength distributions we choose @xmath8 so that the spurious isoscalar dipole mode appears at zero excitation energy .",
    "the strongest renormalization of the @xmath8 values in comparison with the nuclear matter value takes place in light nuclei . for @xmath85pb",
    "the effective value @xmath8 becomes rather close to the nuclear matter one .",
    "as a first example we examine the multipole strength distributions in @xmath98ar .",
    "the calculated strength distributions are displayed in fig.1 .",
    "for the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) and giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) qrpa gives results that are very similar to our previous calculations with the particle - hole rpa @xcite because the influence of pairing on the giant resonance properties is weak .",
    "this is not the case for the first @xmath0 and @xmath1 states that will be discussed later . for the gdr energy centroid",
    "we get @xmath99 mev and this value is rather close to the empirical systematics @xcite @xmath100 mev .",
    "the isoscalar gqr energy centroid is equal to @xmath101 mev that can be compared with the empirical value @xmath102 mev . for the isovector gqr our calculation gives @xmath103 mev that is about 10% less than predicted by the empirical systematics .",
    "it is worth to mention that experimental data for the giant resonances in light nuclei are very scarce .",
    "results of our calculations and experimental data @xcite for the @xmath104 state energies and transition probabilities @xmath105 in several nuclei are shown in table 1 .",
    "one can see that there is a satisfactory agreement with experimental data .",
    "results of our calculations for o and ar isotopes are close to those of qrpa with skyrme forces @xcite and all calculations fail to reproduce the b(e2 ) value in @xmath106o .",
    "making use of the sgii interaction@xcite improves the description for the o isotopes and gives practically the same results for the ar isotopes , but for sn and pb isotopes the results become much worse .",
    "calculations with the ski4 force @xcite do nt change the above conclusions .",
    "the evolution of the b(e2)-values in the ar isotopes demonstrates clearly the pairing effects .",
    "the experimental and calculated b(e2)-values in @xmath107ar are three times less than those in @xmath108ar .",
    "the neutron shell closure leads to the vanishing of the neutron pairing and a reduction of the proton gap . as a result",
    "there is a remarkable reduction of the e2 transition probability in @xmath107ar .",
    "some overestimate of the energies indicates that there is room for two - phonon effects .",
    "indeed , it was found in calculations performed within the qpm for @xmath85pb @xcite that the two - phonon configurations can shift down the @xmath104 energy by more than 1 mev .",
    "the b(e2)-value reduction is about 10% in this case .",
    "the study of the influence of two - phonon configurations on properties of the low - lying states within our approach is in progress now .",
    "results of our calculations for the @xmath109 energies and the transition probabilities b(e3 ) are compared with experimental data @xcite in table 2 .",
    "generally there is a better agreement between theory and experiment than in the case of quadrupole excitations .",
    "other choices of the skyrme forces do not improve the agreement obtained with siii .",
    "an additional information about the structure of the first @xmath110 states can be extracted by looking at the ratio of the multipole transition matrix elements @xmath111 that depend on the relative contributions of the proton and neutron configurations . in the framework of the collective model for isoscalar excitations",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath112 and any deviation from this value can indicate an isovector character of the state .",
    "the @xmath111 ratio can be determined experimentally by using different external probes @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , qrpa calculations of the @xmath111 ratios for the @xmath104 states in some o and ar isotopes have been done .",
    "the predicted results are in good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",

    ". as one can see from table 4 our calculations predict that the @xmath111 ratios for the @xmath109 states are rather close to @xmath114 , thus indicating their isoscalar character .",
    "this conclusion remains valid for the sgii and ski4 parameter sets .",

    "it is shown that the suggested approach enables one to reduce remarkably the dimensions of the matrices that must be inverted to perform structure calculations in very large configuration spaces .    as an illustration of the method we have used the finite rank p - h interaction derived from the skyrme force siii to calculate the energies and transition probabilities of the @xmath104 and @xmath109 states in some o , ar , sn and pb isotopes .",
    "the values calculated within our approach are very close to those that were calculated in qrpa with the full skyrme interactions .",
    "they are generally in a reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
