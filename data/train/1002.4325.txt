    "saturation of the density and binding energy is a fundamental property of atomic nuclei . due to this property",
    ", the nuclear masses can be described well using a liquid - drop approach .",
    "conventionally , in this approach , the nuclear binding energy @xmath1 is written as function of mass number @xmath2 and charge number @xmath3 ( or neutron number @xmath4 ) with the weizs \" acker - bethe mass formula @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the volume energy , @xmath7 ^ 2 a$ ] is the symmetry energy , @xmath8 is the surface energy , and @xmath9 is the coulomb energy .",
    "the sum @xmath10 corresponds to the saturation energy of uniform nuclear matter .",
    "since the matter in a nucleus constitutes a strongly interacting system , it remains a challenging theoretical problem to understand the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) through microscopic calculations that utilize a model of the nuclear force duly incorporating low - energy two - nucleon scattering data and properties of very low - mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is not straightforward to empirically clarify the eos , although constraints on the eos obtained from nuclear masses and radii ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , observables in heavy - ion collision experiments performed at intermediate and relativistic energies ( e.g. , refs .",

    "@xcite ) , and even x - ray observations of isolated neutron stars @xcite and quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite do exist . in this work we will consider such constraints provided by masses of unstable nuclei .",
    "the energy density of bulk nuclear matter is a function of nucleon density @xmath11 and proton fraction @xmath12 , which are related to the neutron and proton number densities @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we can generally express the energy per nucleon near the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter as @xcite @xmath17\\alpha^2 . \\label{eos0}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the saturation energy , the saturation density and the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath21 is the neutron excess . @xmath0 and @xmath22 are associated with the density dependent symmetry energy coefficient @xmath23 : @xmath22 is the symmetry energy coefficient at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the symmetry energy density derivative coefficient ( hereafter referred to as the `` density symmetry coefficient '' ) .",
    "as the neutron excess increases from zero , the saturation point moves in the density versus energy plane .",
    "this movement is determined mainly by the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "up to second order in @xmath26 , the saturation energy @xmath27 and density @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 the slope , @xmath31 , of the saturation line near @xmath32 @xmath33 is thus expressed as @xmath34    in our earlier investigations @xcite we explored a systematic way of extracting @xmath0 and @xmath22 from empirical masses and radii of nuclei , together with the parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 , characterizing the saturation of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we first gave an expression for the energy of uniform nuclear matter , which reduces to the phenomenological form ( [ eos0 ] ) in the simultaneous limit @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "using this energy expression within a simplified version of the extended thomas - fermi approximation , which permits us to determine the macroscopic features of the nuclear ground state , we calculated charges , charge radii and masses of @xmath38-stable nuclei for fixed @xmath2 . comparing these calculations with empirical values allows us to derive the optimal parameter set for fixed values of the slope @xmath31 and the incompressibility @xmath20 .",
    "we thus found a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "the next step was to calculate the root - mean - square ( rms ) charge and matter radii of more neutron - rich nuclei that are expected to be produced in radioactive ion beam facilities .",
    "the results suggest that the density symmetry coefficient @xmath0 may be constrained by possible systematic data for the matter radii in a manner that is nearly independent of @xmath20 .",
    "the reason that we concentrated on radii of unstable nuclei rather than their masses in ref .",
    "@xcite was that we originally considered the surface and electrostatic properties as well as shell and pairing effects , which play a role in nuclear masses , to obscure the derivation of the eos parameters .",
    "nevertheless , in the present analysis , we perform a systematic calculation of nuclear masses from the same framework used for our previous calculations of nuclear radii .",
    "since experimental mass data have been accumulated even for unstable nuclei , we can compare the calculations with the existing data , which is a great advantage over the case of nuclear radii .",
    "comparison of the two - proton separation energy ( @xmath39 ) implies that a larger @xmath0 , corresponding to smaller symmetry energy at subnuclear densities , is favored .",
    "this tendency is most clearly elucidated from the masses of light , nondeformed , and neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "this can be understood from a compressible liquid - drop picture of nuclei in terms of the @xmath0 dependence of the surface symmetry energy , which has some relevance to the neutron skin thickness @xcite .    in sec .",

    "change in this parameter would make no significant difference in the determination of the other parameters and the final results for nuclear masses .    we describe macroscopic nuclear properties in a way dependent on the eos parameters @xmath48 by using a thomas - fermi model @xcite .",
    "the essential point of this model is to write down the total energy of a nucleus of mass number @xmath2 and charge number @xmath3 as a function of the density distributions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bulk energy , @xmath60 is the gradient energy with adjustable constant @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the coulomb energy , and @xmath63 is the neutron number .",

    ". next , for various sets of the incompressibility @xmath20 and the density symmetry coefficient @xmath0 , we obtained the remaining three eos parameters @xmath19 , @xmath18 , and @xmath22 and the gradient coefficient @xmath61 by fitting the calculated optimal values of charge number , mass excess , rms charge radius to empirical data for stable nuclei on the smoothed @xmath38 stability line @xcite and by using eqs .",

    "as a result of this fitting , the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath61 are constrained as @xmath720.17 @xmath73 , @xmath74 mev , @xmath7540 mev , and @xmath76 mev @xmath77 .",
