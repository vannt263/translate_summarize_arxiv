    "the discovery of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors in 1986@xcite  was a watershed in the recent history of condensed matter physics , an event which stimulated intense experimental and theoretical activity .",

    "there is no obvious small parameter which facilitates an expansion about a tractable model . in this paper",
    ", we promulgate the existence of a _ weakly - coupled _ ` dual ' description of a particularly exotic region of the phase diagram .",
    "this description paves the way for controlled calculations of experimentally measurable quantities .    before plunging into our exegesis of this dual description and its consequences ,",
    "let us briefly review the phenomena which we wish to explain .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of temperature @xmath0 and doping @xmath2 ( the nature of the doping varies from material to material , but is generally believed to be proportional to the effective hole concentration in each @xmath3 layer ) is indicated schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "best understood and in many cases very well characterized are the undoped ( @xmath4 ) materials , which are insulating antiferromagnets ( afs ) below the nel temperature @xmath5 . at moderate dopings ( @xmath6 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath7 ) , superconductivity occurs . for many phenomenological purposes the superconducting phase",
    "is adequately described by the same ginzburg - landau and london theory standard for conventional superconductors ( scs).@xcite   one important distinction between the high - t@xmath8 and conventional scs , suspected for many years and now generally accepted after a number of beautiful and compelling experiments,@xcite  is their @xmath9 ( _ d - wave _ ) pairing symmetry .",
    "this pairing symmetry is a crucial ingredient in a zero - temperature quantum description .",
    "in particular , d - wave symmetry leads to gapless quasiparticles residing at the four nodes of the pair wavefunction .",

    "recent studies have revealed puzzling behavior in the _ underdoped _ region between the af and sc . below the high - temperature dotted line ( @xmath10 ) in fig .  1 , angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes),@xcite  transport,@xcite   nmr,@xcite  optical conductivity,@xcite   and other measurements@xcite  indicate a dramatic reduction of low - energy ( single-)electronic and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the ability of arpes measurements to resolve wavevector dependence exposes an angular variation similar to that of d - wave quasiparticles in the scing phase@xcite .",

    "the ultimate nature of the corresponding underlying quantum ground state is an intriguing theoretical puzzle , and a principal subject of this paper .    to proceed , we look to the experiments for guidance . they indicate three types of excitations which are important below the dotted line in fig .  1 : the ordering fields related to antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , _ and _ d - wave quasiparticles near the four nodes .",
    "conspicuously absent from this list are electrons and holes at an ordinary fermi - surface .",
    "the physics of this omission is that pairing occurs ( due to unspecified strong interaction physics ) at the high energy @xmath10 . given these ingredients , one natural theoretical strategy is to attempt to approach the pseudo - gap state by increasing @xmath2 from the af at half - filling .",
    "many researchers have already attempted this approach , but it remains inconclusive .",

    "we are now in a position to extend our understanding of doping to include af order at half - filling , in accord with experimental observations . in all high-@xmath384 materials , doping is actually achieved by chemical substitution / depletion of atoms between the @xmath11 layers . while it is generally believed that this process transfers charge to the @xmath11 planes , this charge transfer is not necessarily proportional to the _ chemical _ doping , defined as the fraction of atoms substituted or removed . to simplify this discussion ,",

    "our description of this part of the phase diagram enjoys kinship with several other approaches .",
    "the nodal liquid phase is reminiscent of the @xmath389-flux state@xcite  and the @xmath87 mft staggered - flux state,@xcite  and is the d - wave analog of the short - range@xcite  resonating valence bond spin - liquid state.@xcite  these states also involve neutral dirac fermions interacting with a gauge field , but the coupling to electromagnetic fields , the coupling between the fermions and the gauge fields , the bosonic charged degrees of freedom , and the evolution with doping are all rather different in the nodal liquid .",
    "several authors@xcite  have conjectured that the lightly - doped 3-leg hubbard ladder might serve as a paradigm for the underdoped cuprates and furukawa and rice@xcite  have tried to substantiate these claims with weak - coupling rg calculations on partially nested fermi liquids .",
    "the nodal liquid concretely realizes the attractive features of this proposal .",
    "the basic idea of bringing af and dsc under the same rubric , which is expressed in ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , is the central theme of zhang s @xmath390 theory.@xcite   however , there is a direct transition from af to dsc in the @xmath390 theory , whereas the nodal liquid intervenes in our theory .",
    "there is a further important distinction , namely , that our theory focuses on the zero - temperature quantum phase transitions of the high-@xmath304 materials .",
    "this is one reason why our theory accords primary importance to the low - energy _",
    "fermionic _ degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , our prediction of phase separation at the dsc transition in the type i scenario as well as our interpretation of @xmath43 echoes the ideas of emery and kivelson.@xcite there are a number of important issues which we have not addressed in this paper . by restricting our attention to the region underneath the dashed line in fig .  1 ,",
    "we have skirted one of the most controversial questions in this field : what mechanism drives pair formation at this scale ? presumably this physics must be understood for progress to be made on the part of the phase diagram above and to the right of the dashed line .",
    "this would require an investigation complementary ( but perhaps orthogonal in spirit ) to ours .",
    "also , our discussion of transport was necessarily incomplete because finite - temperature transport can be particularly subtle ( for recent examples of this , see ref .  ) and the transport properties of the nodal liquid deserve a thorough exposition of their own , which we defer .",
    "moreover , a pure sample would _ melt _ at a finite temperature phase transition , although this transition would be rounded by impurities .",
    "the melting temperature is expected to vanish upon approaching either zero doping or the pwc / nl to dsc quantum phase transition , and therefore has maximum at some intermediate @xmath2 in the underdoped regime .",
    "the effects of disorder are also quite subtle , and warrant a full and separate treatment .",
    "nevertheless , a few comments are germane to this discussion . the first , and most basic ,",
    "is that disorder plays a significant role in the physics of the cuprates . even in @xmath391 , which is believed to be cleaner than , say , @xmath392 , doping can not help but introduce disorder . according to standard arguments,@xcite  first - order phase transitions",
    "will be driven second - order by arbitrarily weak disorder in two dimensions .",
    "in particular , we expect the pwc / nl@xmath393dsc transition to be second order with impurities present .",
    "moreover , based on the irrelevance ( in the technical sense ) of the coupling between the nodons and the superconducting phase in the clean case , we suspect this transition may be in the same universality class as the superconductor  insulator transition .",
    "this could explain the experiments of fukuzumi , _ et al .",
    "_ on @xmath394.@xcitethe disorder will also have an effect on the phases themselves .",
    "for instance , transport and spin dynamics in the nodal liquid will be influenced by disorder .",
    "finally , we note that disorder will transform the pwc into a bose glass ( bg ) .",
    "one consequence would be power - law suppression ( rather than a hard gap ) of the low frequency _ electron _ spectral function at the nodes in the bg / nl phase because the bg is compressible.@xcite   having adopted a panoramic view in the preceeding section , we can afford , in closing , to narrow our focus to the bg / nl ( and the pwc / nl from which it descends ) because it is our candidate for the @xmath395 pseudo - gap phase : a phase without a fermi surface or long - range order but possessing low - energy fermionic excitations centered about four points in the brillouin zone .",

    "a striking feature of this transition , which we access perturbatively in an @xmath454 expansion , is that it is lorentz - invariant .",

    "since the velocity differences scale to zero according to ( [ floweqns ] ) , all physically measurable quantities are a function of @xmath487 in the units which we have chosen , or , upon restoring the velocities , @xmath488 .        as a check on the reliability of the @xmath86-expansion",
