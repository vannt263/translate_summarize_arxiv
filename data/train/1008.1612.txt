    "since the pioneering work by anderson and fazekas@xcite , the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice has been extensively investigated as a promising candidate to realize a spin - liquid ground state induced by geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations . yet , in spite of a large amount of theoretical and experimental works , we do not have any unified picture for this system .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "most of the numerical studies carried out over the past decade with a variety of different techniques do not support that the suggested spin - liquid ground state is realized in this model .",
    "instead they provide evidences to indicate the ground state with the three - sublattice order where the average direction of neighboring spins differs by a @xmath1 angle@xcite .",
    "then the linear spin wave theory ( lswt)@xcite well describes numerical results calculated on lattices with finite sizes .    on the experimental side ,",
    "several novel materials with triangular structures have been investigated recently .",
    "one of these materials is cs@xmath2cucl@xmath3 @xcite , which is supposed to reduce to the one - dimensional spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet because of its anisotropy@xcite .",
    "other interesting materials are @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu@xmath2(cn)@xmath5@xcite and etme@xmath5sb[pb(dmit)@xmath2]@xmath2 @xcite , which are considered to be close to the heisenberg antiferromagnet on an isotropic triangular lattice",
    ". these materials , however , do not show any magnetic long - range order down to the quite low temperature compared with the exchange interactions .    through further studies motivated by these experiments",
    ", theorists have found that fundamental properties on a triangular lattice are quite different from those on a square lattice , while antiferromagnets on both lattices have the semi - classical long - range orders .",
    "the dispersion relation is one of the properties that have been investigated to compare systems with different geometries .",
    "recently the series expansion study@xcite and the full 1/s calculation of the spin wave theory@xcite on this relation show that on a triangular lattice one sees a downward renormalization of the higher energy spectra , while on a square lattice one sees an upward renormalization .",
    "the former authors also point out that the roton minimum is present in the relatively flat region of the dispersion relation on the triangular lattice .",
    "these features are quite different from the predictions of the lswt .    in these somewhat confusing situations",
    "one needs unbiased numerical studies which do not depend on any special physical assumption .",
    "the stochastic state selection ( sss ) method , a new type of monte carlo method which we have developed in several years@xcite , has such a good property .",
    "one can therefore employ the method to evaluate any quantity in any system one wants to investigate .    in the algorithm of the sss method we consider the full hilbert space of the system and stochastically",
    "reduce it to relatively small one so that we can manage it in numerical studies . more concretely",
    ", we use a set of stochastic variables which are as many as basis states of the whole vector space under consideration , but most of these variables are valued to be zero",
    ". then any inner product related to an arbitrary operator is calculable using the survived non - zero stochastic variables .",
    "statistical averaging processes guarantee in a mathematically justified manner that the result becomes the correct value of the inner product .",
    "it is found that several constraints on the set of stochastic variables are helpful to obtain better results with less statistical errors . using this constrained sss method",
    "we started our numerical study on the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a 48-site triangular lattice .",
    "we have estimated lowest energy eigenvalues of the model for each sectors with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9 component of the total spin @xmath10 of the system@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make a further investigation of the model by means of the constrained sss method with two new applications .",
    "one of them is to accurately calculate expectation values of operators which contain many off - diagonal elements in their representations . by evaluating the sublattice magnetization and the static structure function",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain accurate knowledge of the ground state in this method .",
    "it should be noted that in the usual quantum monte carlo method these physical quantites are not easy to calculate even for non - frustrated systems .",
    "another is an extension to employ a new set of basis states with which complex coefficients are inevitable in an expansion of an arbitrary state . using this set of basis states in the constrained sss method we successfully calculate low - lying one magnon spectra with non - zero wave vectors .",
    "it should also be noted that even for non - frustrated systems such as the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice we can not do without complex numbers in calculations with non - zero wave vectors .",
    "our study in this paper performed by means of the constrained sss method gives reliable results calculated from the first principle .",
    "we see that our results are compatible with those in refs.@xcite .",
    "it therefore supports the realization of an ordered ground state in the model . at the same time",
    ", however , it adds an evidence that dynamical properties of the system are not described by the lswt .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we make brief descriptions of the model and the method .",
    "subsection [ subsec21 ] is to define the hamiltonian of the model we study .",
    "in addition we comment on the power method .",
    "an operator related to the hamiltonian is introduced here so that we can obtain the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian using the power method . in subsection [ subsec22 ]",
    "the sss method is shortly reviewed . here",
    "an introduction of a two - valued stochastic variable that might be zero is essential .",
    "then the constrained sss method is explained . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "subsection [ subsec31 ] is to show our definition and results on the sublattice magnetization and the static structure function .",
    "these results are compared with those reported on smaller lattices . on the sublattice magnetization",
    "we also make a comparison with results calculated by the lswt . in subsection [ subsec32 ]",
    "we show our results on the one magnon spectra . for nine independent states in the brillouin zone of a 48-site triangular lattice",
    "we present estimated values of energy eigenvalues .",
    "then the one - magnon dispersion relation is studied in comparison with results by the lswt .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to summary .",
    "here we also count up characteristic features of our method . finally an appendix is given to explain our sets of basis states in detail .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model on the @xmath11-site lattice is @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the spin-1/2 operator on the @xmath14-th site and the sum runs over all @xmath15 bonds of the @xmath11-site lattice .",
    "the coupling @xmath16 is set to 1 throughout this paper . in our calculations",
    "we employ the power method .",
    "the sss method is used to calculate expectation values of powers of an operator @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the identity operator and @xmath20 is a positive number . for each quantum number",
    "we choose one value of @xmath20 which ensures that the lowest energy eigenvalue of the system corresponds to the eigenvalue of @xmath21 whose absolute value is the largest .",
    "detailed explanations are given in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "in the power method we can estimate the energy eigenvalue @xmath22 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a state which approximates the exact eigenstate @xmath25 of @xmath21 , @xmath26 since @xmath27 holds .",
    "we estimate an expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath28 in the eigenstate @xmath25 using @xmath29 note that in this calculation a contamination appears at @xmath30 order because @xmath31      the stochastic state selection is realized by a number of stochastic variables .",
    "let us expand a normalized state @xmath32 in an @xmath33-dimensional vector space by a basis @xmath34 , @xmath35 then for each @xmath36 we generate a stochastic variable @xmath37 following to the on - off probability function , @xmath38 with a positive parameter @xmath39 which is common to all @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "note that ( [ probf ] ) implies @xmath42 or @xmath43 , statistical averages being @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in numerical studies",
    "we can neglect basis states whose @xmath37=0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 therefore controls the size of the partial vector space we should consider in each sampling .",
    "then calculations in the full vector space are to be recovered through statistical averaging processes .    a random choice operator @xmath47 is then defined by @xmath48 using this @xmath47 we obtain a state @xmath49 , @xmath50 which has less non - zero elements than @xmath32 has .",
    "it should be kept in mind that with any operator @xmath28 the statistical average @xmath51 is exactly equal to the expectation value @xmath52 because @xmath53 for all @xmath36 .    in calculations using the power method",
    "we generate independent random choice operators the stochastic variable @xmath37 in @xmath54 is generated independently to the one in @xmath55 with @xmath56 . ]",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 to obtain an improved state @xmath60 from @xmath24 .",
    "namely , we define @xmath61 and @xmath62    in the constrained sss method , we introduce @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) constraints which can be fulfilled by making @xmath63 @xmath37s depend on other @xmath65 independently generated stochastic variables for each random choice operator .",
    "a detailed description on this improvement is given in our previous paper@xcite together with numerical studies with a @xmath66 case .",
    "in the same manner as ref.@xcite , we use the state @xmath67 instead of the above mentioned @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 and @xmath69 with random choice operators @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath59 , each of which is generated under a constraint @xmath72    we can evaluate an expectation value of an operator @xmath28 by a statistical average of the ratio @xmath73 with large enough value of @xmath74 . actually , in order to save the computing time , either of the following two ratios is employed in our numerical study instead of ( [ ratioo ] ) , @xmath75 or @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes another random choice operator , which is generated independently to @xmath78 with the constraint @xmath79 .",
    "it should be noted that the method is applicable for a state which has complex coefficients as well as a state with real coefficients . for a complex coefficient @xmath80",
    "we obtain , after the stochastic selection , @xmath81 or @xmath82 if @xmath83 . with complex coefficients we newly have two technical difficulties .",
    "one of them is that we need double computer memory to treat complex numbers .",
    "another is that we can not use the symmetries of rotation and reflection which reduce the number of independent basis states .",
    "in this subsection we present our results of the sublattice magnetization and of the static structure function in the ground state , which we evaluate on the 48-site lattice using the ratio defined by ( [ ratiomo ] ) .",
    "we start from an approximate state constructed in the sector with @xmath84 since we want evaluate them in the ground state of the system .",
    "detailed explanations of the way to calculate this approximate state are given in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "since the squared sublattice magnetization , which we denote by @xmath85 for the system with @xmath11 sites , is defined in ref.@xcite as @xmath86 the operator @xmath28 in ( [ ratioo ] ) for @xmath85 should be @xmath87 where a , b and c are sublattices of the @xmath11-site triangular lattice and @xmath88 our estimation of the sublattice magnetization with @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",
    "[ fig : mag ] plots this result together with those reported on @xmath91 , 27 and 36 lattices@xcite .",
    "as is shown by calculations up to the 36-site lattice , the finite - size analysis on the magnetization suggests a finite value of the magnetization in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we see that our result is consistent with those for smaller lattices , which supports the scaling predicted by the lswt , @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95@xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the sublattice magnetization , @xmath96 , is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag ] .",
    "next we show results of the static structure function @xmath97 in the ground state , for which the operator @xmath28 is defined by @xmath98 with @xmath99 possible values of @xmath100 on the 48-site lattice , where @xmath101=@xmath102 , are obtained from the brillouin zone shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] .",

    "[ fig : sf ] .",
    "we observe that in the full range of @xmath100 our @xmath89 results lie slightly below those calculated on the 36-site lattice .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the one magnon spectra with @xmath112 .",
    "detailed descriptions of wave vectors @xmath113 and a set of basis states @xmath114 we use here are given in the appendix .",
    "for each value of @xmath115 on the 48-site lattice , we start from an approximate state @xmath116 expanded by a set of basis states @xmath114 with complex coefficients , @xmath117 which is used as @xmath24 in ( [ phindef ] ) , ( [ constcd ] ) and so on .",
    "the state @xmath116 is prepared following descriptions in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "in @xmath116 we constructed for each @xmath113 , the number of basis states with non - zero @xmath118 , which we denote by @xmath119 , ranges from 270 million to 1.6 billion .",
    "we evaluate an upper bound of the lowest energy eigenvalue @xmath120 , using the ratio @xmath121 in ( [ ratioom ] ) with the operator @xmath122 .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tab : result ] together with values of @xmath20 and @xmath119 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we plot a gap energy of one magnon with a wave vector @xmath123 , which is calculated from data in table  [ tab : result ] by @xmath124 along the path @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] .",
    "we also plot the dispersion relation calculated by the lswt@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we see that our data is consistent with the gapless state at the ordering wave vector , which is expected by the full breaking of the @xmath126 symmetry .",
    "the gap energy at the central region of the brillouin zone is much smaller than that calculated by the lswt analysis .",
    "this downward renormalization is in contrast with the upward renormalization found in the square lattice . in the same central region",
    "we also find that the spectra is flat or dispersionless .    0.5 cm",
    "in this paper we have reported further developments on numerical calculations by means of the stochastic state selection ( sss ) method , which has the following good properties .    * with this method we can study large systems compared to the exact diagonalization@xcite . *",
    "this method presents a solution for the so - called sign problem .",
    "note that the ordinary quantum monte carlo method , which has been quite powerful to study spin systems on bipartite lattices@xcite , does not work in most frustrated systems .",
    "* one does not need any physical assumption .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation that recent variational approaches are based on some assumptions which are specific to the system to be studied .",
    "for example , the coupled - cluster method@xcite is based on an eigenstate with a special form . in the density matrix renormalization group method @xcite",
    ", on the other hand , one assumes that the ground state is represented by the matrix product state .",
    "another example is the stochastic reconfiguration method@xcite whose origin is assigned to the fixed - node monte carlo method@xcite . in these methods",
    "an effective hamiltonian is used instead of the exact one .",
    "* in the sss method it is easy to treat complex coefficients in the expansion of states .",
    "this is impossible in the ordinary monte carlo method .    using this method we numerically study the spin-@xmath105 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on the 48-site triangular lattice .",
    "we evaluate the sublattice magnetization and the static structure function in the ground state of the system .",
    "we also calculate the one magnon spectra with non - zero wave vectors .",
    "our results on the magnetization and the structure function show that the sss method is quite effective to estimate these quantities .",
    "the accuracy of the data , which depends on how many samples are available to calculate statistical averages , is satisfying within our computing resources .",
    "we observe that the results we obtain are consistent with the reported ones on smaller lattices .",
    "therefore we see that the linear spin wave theory describes the results well so that an analysis based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking on the semi - classical nel order ground state is acceptable .    on the magnon spectra , we make sure that the one magnon energy at the ordering wave vector is consistent with the goldstone mode , as is expected in the spin wave analysis . for other values of the wave vectors , however , we observe flat spectra with strong downward renormalization , which are quite different from the spectra predicted by the lswt .",
    "we find our results are qualitatively consistent with results by the series expansion study@xcite and by the order @xmath0 calculation of the spin wave analysis@xcite .",
    "finally let us again emphasize that we can get physical insight for the frustrated quantum spin systems from numerical results by the sss method because the method is well developed to calculate various observables such as energy , the magnetization and the magnon spectra .",
    "especially it is notable that using this method we can evaluate the magnon spectra .",
    "while neither the ordinary monte carlo method nor the variational monte carlo method is applicable to calculate this quantity , we can use the sss method in the same manner as the one used to evaluate the ground state energy .    in this appendix",
    "we summarize our definition of wave vectors @xmath113 and two sets of basis states @xmath127 and @xmath114 employed in this paper .",
    "the former set @xmath127 , which is introduced for the 48-site lattice in the previous work with @xmath128  @xcite , is used to calculate the sublattice magnetization and the static structure function . while the latter set @xmath114 is newly introduced here in calculations of the one magnon spectra with non - zero wave vectors .",
    "let us denote two basis vectors of the triangular lattice by @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which are described by unit vectors @xmath131 and @xmath132 in @xmath133- and @xmath134-directions , @xmath135 the wave vectors are defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 @xmath138,2 @xmath139 are two basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice for which @xmath140 holds .    to construct a state with a fixed wave vector @xmath113 , we first define translation operators @xmath141 in the directions @xmath142 @xmath143 . for any state",
    "@xmath144 the translation operators @xmath145 and @xmath146 produce new states if @xmath144 is not an eigenstate of them .",
    "we define , with @xmath147 @xmath143 , @xmath148 using these states we make an eigenstate common to @xmath145 and @xmath146 , @xmath149 here the sum runs over all @xmath150 and @xmath151 for which @xmath152 s are linearly independent .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath153 in ( [ comeigens ] ) is therefore @xmath154 when all @xmath155 are independent to each other .",
