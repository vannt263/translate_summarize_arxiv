    "the formation and control of periodic nanostructures in various type media ( media with periodically modulated refractive index ( mpmri ) ) are one of most important applied problems .",
    "first of all it is related to the possibility of the creation of compact uv or x - ray free - electron lasers ( fel ) based on the principle of transition radiation ( tr ) ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "currently the following two problems are discussed intensively :    1 .   a gas - plasma medium with periodically varied ionization density @xcite , 2 .   a specially periodical solid - state superlattice - like ( ssl ) structures , which are composed of layers with different refracted indices @xcite .",
    "tr is generated due to the difference in frequency - dependent dielectric constants ( dielectric permittivity functions ) of adjacent layers ( recall that radiation power is proportional to @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] ) .",
    "therefore , an important problem is the possibility of the control of this difference by means of some external field . in other words ,",
    "a problem is to construct a superlattice with dielectric constant difference between neighboring domains having a form @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath5 describes controlling parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dielectric permittivity functions in the neighboring regions . according to theoretical and experimental studies",
    "the periodical structures can be created in condensed matter by means of external electromagnetic or acoustic fields ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "this idea have been applied recently for experimental tr generation @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the electron beam of 20@xmath8 , passing through amorphous silicon dioxide @xmath9 with the standing electromagnetic wave ( of 10 @xmath10 frequency and 3 @xmath11 wavelength ) inside , produces anomaly high radiation .",
    "preliminary investigations explain its high intensity as a result of the multiple passing of the electron beam through interfaces between regions with different dielectric constants .",
    "the theoretical study explained the appearance of one - dimensional superlattice order in random media by media polarization , caused by orientation relaxation of elastic molecular dipoles in external field @xcite .    the main goal of this paper is systematic investigation of the relaxation processes and critical effects in the disordered @xmath0 spin system type of @xmath9 under the influence of external electromagnetic field , which forms a standing wave in the medium .",
    "in particular , we develop a mathematical approach for description of statistical behavior of disordered @xmath0 spin system along the direction of standing wave propagation on space - time scale of its period .    in the framework of this approach",
    "we generalize clausius - mossotti equation for dielectric constant and the equation for frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity on the scale of space - time period of standing electromagnetic wave .",
    "let us begin by discussing the fundamental problem of the dielectric constant space - time modulation ( generation of dielectric constant superlattice with controlling parameters ) in some types of amorphus materials .    in this subsection",
    ", we shall give mathematical formulations for dielectric constant in the presence of an standing low electrical field .",
    "a particular attention will be pointed to investigation of dispersion properties of dielectric permittivity function where generation of collective orientation effects is possible under the standing low electromagnetic field .",
    "the starting point in our discussion will be clausius - mossotti relation for dielectric constant .",
    "it is known that in isotropic mediums ( as well as in the crystals with cubic symmetry ) the dielectric constant is well described by the clausius - mossotti formula ( see for example @xcite )    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the concentration of particles ( electrons , atoms , ions , molecules ( or dipoles ) ) with the given @xmath14 types of polarizabilities and @xmath15 correspondingly are coefficients of polarizabilities . from this formula",
    "it follows that the static dielectric constant @xmath16 depends on the polarizabilities properties of the particles as well as on their topological order . in the external alternating field the homogeneity and the isotropy of the medium is often lost .",
    "then , it is expected that the formula ( [ 01 ] ) will be applicable after the minor generalization .",
    "the object of our investigation will be solid state dielectrics type of amorphous silicon dioxide @xmath9 . according to numerical @xmath17 @xmath18 simulations @xcite",
    ", the structure of this type compound is well described by @xmath0 random network ( see fig . 1 . )    ) is described by @xmath0 random network with covalent bonds .",
    "every silicon vertex ( gold sphere ) has 4 edges and every oxygen vertex ( red sphere ) has 2 edges._,height=226 ]    the white and black nodes in this figure correspond to different atoms while links between them correspond to covalent bonds .",
    "the redistribution of charges in outer electronic shells takes place because of the asymmetry of the bounded atoms . as a result",
    "some atoms acquire positive charge while others acquire negative ones .",
    "thus this type of compound can be treated as a disordered @xmath0 rigid dipoles system ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . below this system will be called a @xmath0 disordered spin system . for the description of amorphus media we use @xmath0 lattice with the lattice constant @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the molecule mass",

    "medium under the standing electromagnetic wave .",
    "_ , height=226 ]    the following natural question arises .",
    "how does dielectric constant change on scale of wavelength period and on time interval @xmath29 when the relaxation time of molecular dipoles is @xmath30 .",
    "this question is important because faster processes , like the transition or cherenkov radiation , can go in the media .",
    "note , that the time of relativistic electron is passing the wavelength ( @xmath31 ) of standing wave and the time of formation of transition or cherenkov photons in this layer is smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "this time interval is essentially lower than the time during which the standing wave is stationary .",
    "since the wavelength is supposed to be much bigger than the inter - dipole distance @xmath33 , the clausius - mossotti relation still remains true . in this case",
    "the main problem is to calculate the polarizabilitiy coefficient related to orientational effects .    taking into account the external field",

    "contributes in the value of the dipole moment ( spin ) .",
    "note , that the number of the carriers of given polarization type in elementary cell is @xmath37 , @xmath38 coefficients of corresponding types polarizabilities taking into account the external field and @xmath39 is local field , the effective field , at the site of an individual molecule that causes the induced polarization .",
    "each effect adds linearly to the net dipole moment per molecule which is a fact verified by experiments . under the action of external field",
    "different polarization types arise in media .",
    "however as the simple analysis shows the value of polarizabilities coefficient determined by the orientational effects is essentially higher than others .",
    "note that the elastic orientational polarizability coefficient in amorphous media @xmath40 randomly depends on the cell location .",
    "this fact is the consequence of random orientation of the local field strengths @xmath41 with respect to the external field @xmath42 .",
    "therefore all the terms in the right side of ( [ 01 ] ) are basically known and well studied in literature ( see for example @xcite ) except from those which are connected with orientational effects .",
    "the orientational effects have a collective nature and are characterized by average value of random sum @xmath43 ( sum of random coefficients of orientational polarizabilities ) .    multiplying both sides of the relation ( [ 03 ] ) on the external field ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath44\\vec{e } ( x;e_0,\\omega,\\varphi_0 ) , \\label{04}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 describes the potential energy of amorphous matter in the external field , symbol @xmath5 shows parameters of standing wave @xmath46 ( controlling parameters ) .",

    "the definition of distribution function will be given in section 4 .",
    "recall , that in ( [ 07 ] ) we take into account only negative values of @xmath65 , because only for these values the spin chins maybe stable .",
    "taking the average value of expression ( [ 07 ] ) , we obtain the following relation for the mean value of the potential increment :    @xmath67    @xmath68    where the bracket @xmath69 means the integration over @xmath61 on a scale @xmath51 , the mean value of a full averaging potential energy of interaction between the spin chains and the external field is defined by term -@xmath70 .",
    "* definition 1 . * in the relation ( [ 08 ] ) parameter @xmath71 will be named a collective polarization coefficient of steric @xmath1 spin chain .",

    "when @xmath74 it is simple to show that @xmath75 .",

    "as we have already shown in order to take into account the contribution of orientation effects into the polarization one has to calculate the total average value of the interaction potential of steric spin chain with the external field @xmath94 .",
    "taking into account the fact that the external field is low i.e. @xmath95 , we can apply the taylor decomposition of dipole angular momentum : @xmath96 where @xmath97 , as well as @xmath98 and @xmath99 are correspondingly the field strength and the dipole angular momentum of the molecule , located in the @xmath100-th cell in the absence of the external field . in case when the coordinate @xmath61 is outside of @xmath100-th cell , the field vanishes .",
    "inside the cell they have constant values . from the discussion above and taking into account ( [ 07 ] ) , the relation ( [ 15 ] ) can be represented in the form : @xmath101 using the fact that without an external field the spin system has no polarization we conclude that first sum in ( [ 16 ] ) vanishes . in other words ,",
    "the interaction potential has the following form : @xmath102    now we turn to the equation of motion for the steric spin - chain with relaxation in @xmath0 spin lattice in external field .",

    "we conclude that under the influence of the external field ( [ 02 ] ) with frequency @xmath114 the main part comes from elastic dipole ( dipole thermal polarization is not essential in this case due to the large relaxation time @xmath115 @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us note that the coefficient of elastic dipole polarization at low external fields is determined by @xcite : @xmath116\\bigr)^2=\\frac { p^0}{e_{int}^0}\\sin^2[\\beta(l_x - x)],\\ ] ] @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the angle between the external @xmath119 and the internal @xmath120 fields , @xmath121 is the dipole energy in the field @xmath122 .",
    "following heuristic argumentation of debby @xcite , @xcite one can write down the expression for the elastic dipole polarization , which takes into account the spin ( polar molecule ) relaxation process in the glass : @xmath123}{e_{int}^{\\,0}(1-i\\omega\\tau ) } , \\label{23}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the spin relaxation time in the glass .",
    "it is very small in the aforementioned media @xmath124 sec ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "so , the equation ( [ 18 ] ) with generalized coefficient of elastic dipole polarizabilitiy ( [ 23 ] ) will describe the motion of @xmath1 random steric spin chain in the external field with relaxation .",

    "for further investigation , it is convenient to represent the complex equation ( [ 20 ] ) as a system of two real equations : @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",

    "note , that the solution of equation ( [ 32 ] ) must satisfy the initial condition : @xmath152 where the initial phases @xmath153 and @xmath154 are equal to zero .",
    "later we will be more interested in the fixed limit of the solution ( [ 32 ] ) , which is obviously received under values @xmath155 which is equivalent to the condition @xmath156 . in that limit the equation ( [ 32 ] ) is simplified and accurate to the value @xmath157 may take the following form : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the ( [ 34 ] ) is an elliptic type differential equation for which there are not real characteristics .",
    "this implies that the type of quasilinear equation depends on which solution is considered and can be different for different solutions .",

    "before turning to the effective statical dielectric constant calculation the two important problems have to be solved .",
    "the first one is the calculation of the partition function @xmath66 for the steric @xmath1 random spin chain with energy @xmath65 , whereas the second one is the determination of the thickness of layers on a scale of this chain ( i.e. the fragmentation of the media on layers with different dielectric constant ) .",
    "first , let us consider the statistical properties of the @xmath1 steric spin chain .",
    "as it is shown , the type of a compound @xmath167 can be used as a canonical model for such network glasses describing continuous random networks of atom and bonds @xcite,@xcite ( see fig 1 ) .",

    "note that this allows to use the ergodic hypothesis ( see ( [ 07 ] ) ) and make reduction of @xmath0 spin lattice dynamical problem to the problem of @xmath1 complex langevin - schrdinger type stochastic differential equation ( see ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) ) and the problem of construction statistical mechanics of steric disordered spin chain system . as it is easy to see , this type of reduction in a certain sense is conditional because both problems are interrelated .    for further investigations",
    "it is favorable to consider the spin - glass hamiltonian of type :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is a distance between @xmath1 spins @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( classical vectors of unit length ) , @xmath172 is its random part , subject to gaussian distribution with zero mean value and unit variance , @xmath173 is nearest - neighbor interaction constant , which depends on the distance between spins",

    "the point is that the equilibrium state in gas is characterized by one temperature whereas the spin system can be in the equilibrium state in any negative energy .",
    "these energies coincide with the local minimums of non - perturbed hamiltonian and as it is well - known their numbers can be high @xcite . in other words , in this case the phase space can be decomposed uniquely into micro - canonical states associated with different thermodynamic equilibrium states @xcite .",

    "now , taking into account ( [ 39])-([42 ] ) , one can present the expression of the energy distribution function for @xmath198 spin system ( this expression can be explained as a local partition function in above mentioned multicanonical thermodynamics ) : @xmath199 where @xmath200 describes the set of random distances @xmath172 and random angles @xmath201 , correspondingly @xmath202 is an element of the solid angle @xmath203 containing the unit vector @xmath204",

    "nanoparticles ( spin chains ) with the _ super spins _ ( macropolarizations ) are generated on the microscale space and nanoscale time .",
    "now we can examine the question of dividing the dielectric medium on the regions with extremely different polarizations . recall that the polarized medium without an external field has a zero macroscopic polarization on the space scale @xmath244 .",
    "after turning on the external field in the medium ( on the scale of wavelength of standing electrical field ) the amplification of the orientational effects and , as a result , the initiation of macroscopic polarization is possible . assuming that the collective orientation effects , generated in those regions of media , where voltage of external field @xmath245 is of order to the critical value @xmath246 , we can divide the scale of wavelength of external field on the forth region . in the first and third regions",

    "it is easy to see that the nominator of the expression ( [ 52 ] ) has no singularities and is bounded by the imaginary part of the potential increment ( [ 37 ] ) .",
    "the important characteristic is the dielectric constant s difference in neighboring layers .",
    "taking into account the relations ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 52 ] ) one can get : @xmath249 dielectric permittivity of layer in the external field can be calculated simply : @xmath250 from equation ( [ 54 ] ) taking into account debye relaxation model in the @xmath61-rays region we find : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the plasma frequency of media .",

    "this fact in contrast to usual case builds the media with radically new properties .",
    "recall when the external field is absent the dielectric permittivity function depends on @xmath16 , which is order of unit real positive constant .",
    "in this article a new microscopic approach is developed for the study of the properties of stationary dielectric constant and dielectric permittivity function in the dielectric medium under the external standing electromagnetic field .",
    "the approach consists of the following two general steps :    1 .",
    "generalization of clausius - mossotti equation for dielectric constant in the external standing electromagnetic wave ; 2 .",
    "generalization of the equation for dielectric permittivity function taking into account the previous results .",
    "mathematically the problem is solved as follows .",
    "the dielectric medium in the external electromagnetic field is modelled as a @xmath0 spin - glass system under the external field .",
    "note that all general changes of properties of media take place in the scale of wavelength of external field .",
    "for that the layer of medium which consist from disordered @xmath1 spin chains with length of order of wavelength in detail has been investigated .",
    "taking into account the fact that the distribution of spin chains in the infinite @xmath256 plan is isotropic we can use the birgoff ergodic hypothesis ( see ( [ 06])-([07 ] ) ) and conditionally reduce the initial @xmath0 spin - glass problem to two @xmath1 problems .",
    "it means that we can investigate two @xmath1 problems separately only in this case the parameters of the first @xmath1 problem must be taken into account during the solution of the second @xmath1 problem .    in the work",
    "all formal definitions for accounting the investment of orientational effects in the stationary and frequency - depended dielectric constants computation are adduced .",
    "the first @xmath1 problem is related to one - dimensional disordered quantum @xmath2-particle system with relaxation .",
    "the investigation of the motion in this system takes place in the framework of complex langevin - schrdinger type sde ( [ 18 ] ) , which can be transformed to @xmath257 system of nonlinear langevin type sde ( [ 29])-([30 ] ) . for probability distribution of interaction potential in @xmath1 spin chain with certain energies",
    "@xmath258 and external standing electromagnetic wave fokker - plank equation ( [ 32 ] ) is obtained , which is found after using white noise model for stochastic forces and system of sde ( [ 29])-([30 ] ) . in the limit of long - range distance @xmath259",
    ", the probability distribution @xmath260 tends to the limit of its stationary limit @xmath261 which satisfies the elliptic type differential equation ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "note , that this type of differential equation ( [ 34 ] ) depending on parameters can have extremely various solutions between which there are nt smooth transitions . in another words",
    "this type of behavior in the solutions we can interpret as a critical phenomenon in the @xmath0 spin - glass system .",
    "the second @xmath1 problem includes the computation of @xmath1 random spin chain energy distribution in the external field . in other words , it means the development of multicanonical statistical mechanics for disordered @xmath1 spin chain system in the external field . in order to do this the classical spin - glass heisenberg type hamiltonian",
    "is investigated ( [ 38 ] ) . in the first step ,",
    "the nonperturbed hamiltonian ( [ 39 ] ) is used and the system of algebraic equations ( [ 40 ] ) is found for computation of all possible stable spin configurations on the spin chain scale .",
    "after this , the statistic weight @xmath262 for certain energies @xmath234 of stable non - perturbed spin chain is found simply by formula ( [ 41 ] ) . with the help of formulas ( [ 41])-([46 ] ) the partition function @xmath66 , which gives an energy distribution in the spin chain system after inserting of external field ,",
    "is defined ( [ 48 ] ) .",
    "the helmholtz free energy ( [ 51 ] ) is constructed and it is shown that the @xmath1 random spin chain system subjected to weak external field @xmath263 and the order @xmath264 can be severely changed ( see fig .",
    "the mean value of complex interaction potential @xmath265 between spin chain and external field is found from formula ( [ 07 ] ) taking into account expressions ( [ 41 ] ) and ( [ 48 ] ) .",
    "an averaging potential is used for computation of polarizability coefficient related with the orientation effects ( [ 09 ] ) and correspondingly for generalization of clausius - mossotti equation ( [ 11 ] ) . remind that eq . ( [ 11 ] ) has a content only on the micro - scale space and the nano - scale time .",
    "note , that the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) together with ( [ 23 ] ) show that in the spin - glass medium with the help of weak external field it is possible to form regions ( layers ) with different stationary dielectric constants @xmath266 ( see fig 8) . as it is easy to understand the value of stationary dielectric constant strongly depends on initial electrostatic dielectric constant @xmath267 of media .",
    "in particular , it is shown that in the spin - glass mediums with static dielectric constants @xmath268 under the external field the value of the stationary dielectric constant can be changed maximum 3 - 4 times . in the case",
    "@xmath269 analysis shows that the value of @xmath270 and correspondingly stationary dielectric constant can be complex function @xmath266 depending on the parameters of external field @xmath5 .",
    "moreover for a set of some parameters of weak external field it is safe to say that the @xmath271 can have a large imaginary part ( see ( [ 52 ] ) ) .",
    "obviously , near to this value critical effecters are hold . in this case taking into account the relaxation processes , which are going in the lattice , the system becomes ordered and is characterized by macroscopic classical polarization .",
    "the second main step of investigation is the frequency - dependant dielectric constant or dielectric permittivity .",
    "generalized clausius - mossotti eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) may be used for derivation of generalized equation for dielectric permittivity ( [ 14 ] ) for the frequencies range @xmath272 .",
    "it is important to say that the analysis of stationary dielectric constant value @xmath266 shows that dielectric permittivity function @xmath273 ( see ( [ 54 ] ) and ( [ 55 ] ) ) can have positive , as well as negative dispersions .",
    "the last circumstance is very important especially for the @xmath61-range frequency @xmath274 because on the scale of wavelength of external field @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) the dielectric permittivity in the region of positive dispersion `` i '' and `` iii '' @xmath275 whereas in the neighbor region of negative dispersion `` ii '' and `` iv '' correspondingly @xmath276 ( see for example @xcite ) . recall that this occurs when initial electrostatic dielectric constant @xmath277 . evidently that the difference between dielectric permittivity of neighboring layers ( [ 57 ] ) in the @xmath61-ray region as compared with usual cases when the external field is absent can differ drastically .    in this case",
    "collective orientation effects of spins make main investment in the permittivity function ( macroscopic polarization ) which radically changes behavior of media on the space - time scale of external standing electromagnetic wave .",
    "particularly only a presence of large imaginary part in the coefficient of @xmath278 brings to an essential growth of the real part of difference @xmath279 .",
    "thus , obviously it is possible to make and control the periodic structure from dielectric permittivities in the spin - glass type dielectric medium even with the help of weak external standing ( [ 02 ] ) electromagnetic field . in other words a new type of controlled radiator for generation of coherent @xmath61-radiation",
    "is suggested .",
    "on the other hand the periodic dielectric permittivity function may be illustrated as a @xmath1 lattice of quantum dots ( quantum strings ) which can be interesting in the view of quantum computer making .",
    "finally it is important to note that the first time a new mathematical method for reducing the problem of dynamical @xmath0 disordered spin system in the external field to the two conditionally separated @xmath1 problems is developed .",
    "the last circumstance can be used for elaboration of new extremely effective parallel algorithms which is very important for systematic investigations of mentioned problem in the framework of numerical simulations method .",
