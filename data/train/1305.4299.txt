    "<S> the ability to understand and eventually predict the emergence of information and activation cascades in social networks is core to complex socio - technical systems research . </S>",
    "<S> however , the complexity of social interactions makes this a challenging enterprise . </S>",
    "<S> previous works on cascade models assume that the emergence of this collective phenomenon is related to the activity observed in the local neighborhood of individuals , but do not consider what determines the willingness to spread information in a time - varying process . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a mechanistic model that accounts for the temporal evolution of the individual state in a simplified setup . </S>",
    "<S> we model the activity of the individuals as a complex network of interacting integrate - and - fire oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces the statistical characteristics of the cascades in real systems , and provides a framework to study time - evolution of cascades in a state - dependent activity scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> the proliferation of social networking tools and the massive amounts of data associated to them has evidenced that modeling social phenomena demands a complex , dynamic perspective . </S>",
    "<S> physical approaches to social modeling are contributing to this transition from the traditional paradigm ( scarce data and/or purely analytical models ) towards a data - driven new discipline @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shift is also changing the way in which we can analyze social contagion and its most interesting consequence : the emergence of information cascades . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical approaches , like epidemic and rumor dynamics @xcite , reduce these events to physically plausible mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> these idealizations deliver analytically tractable models , but they attain only a qualitative resemblance to empirical results @xcite , for instance regarding avalanche size distributions . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the challenge of having mechanistic models that include more essential factors , like the propensity of individuals to retransmit information , still remain open .    with the availability of massive amounts of microblogging data logs , like twitter , we are in a position to scrutinize the patterns of real activity and </S>",
    "<S> model them . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of models to this end are based on a dynamical process that determines individuals activity ( transmission of information ) , and this activity is propagated according to certain rules usually based on the idea of social reinforcement , i.e. the more active neighbors an individual has , the larger his probability to become also active , and thus to contribute to the transmission of information .    along these lines , </S>",
    "<S> the often used threshold model @xcite ( and its networked version @xcite ) mimics social dynamics , where the pressure to engage a behavior increases as more friends adopt that same behavior . briefly </S>",
    "<S> , the networked threshold model assigns a fixed threshold @xmath0 , drawn from a distribution @xmath1 , to each node ( individual ) in a complex network of size @xmath2 and an arbitrary degree distribution @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> each node is marked as _ inactive _ except an initial seeding fraction of active nodes , typically @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a node @xmath5 with degree @xmath6 updates its state becoming active whenever the fraction of active neighbors @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation of this mechanistic process evolves following this rule until an equilibrium is reached , i.e. , no more updates occur . given this setup , the _ cascade condition _ in degree - uncorrelated networks </S>",
    "<S> can be derived from the growth of the initial fraction of active nodes , who on their turn might induce the one - step - to - activation ( vulnerable ) nodes . therefore , large cascades can only occur if the average cluster size of vulnerable nodes diverges . using a generating function approach , this condition is met at    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the fraction of nodes of degree @xmath10 close to their activation threshold and @xmath11 is the average degree @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    for @xmath12 all the clusters of vulnerable nodes are small , and the initial seed can not spread beyond isolated groups of early adopters ; on the contrary , if @xmath13 then small fraction of disseminators may unleash with finite probability large cascades . more recently , the cascade condition has been analytically determined for different initial conditions @xcite as well as for modular and correlated networks , while placing the threshold model in the more general context of critical phenomena and percolation theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these efforts , however , have a limited scope since they can account only for one - shot events , for instance the spread of chain letters , the diffusion of a single rumor or the adoption of an innovation . in other cases , instead </S>",
    "<S> , empirical evidence suggests that once an agent becomes active that behavior will be sustained , and reinforced , over time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this creates a form of enduring activation that will be affected and affect other agents over time in a recursive way . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , cascades evolve in time @xcite , as a consequence of dynamical changes in the states of agents as dynamics progress . </S>",
    "<S> cascades are then events that brew over time in a system that holds some memory of past interactions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the propensity to be active in the propagation of information sometimes depends on other factors than raw social influence , e.g. , mood , personal implication , opinion , etc .    in this paper , we present a threshold model , with self - sustained activity , where system - wide events emerge as microscopical conditions become increasingly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> we capitalize on the classical integrate - and - fire oscillator ( ifo ) model by mirollo and strogatz @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> each node in a network of size @xmath2 is characterized by a voltage - like state @xmath14 of an oscillator , which monotonically increases with phase @xmath15 until it reaches a fixed threshold , and then it _ fires _ ( emits information to its coupled neighbors , and resets its state to 0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsatile dynamics , makes that each time a node fires , the state of its @xmath10 neighbors is increased by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , @xmath17 $ ] is uniformly distributed at @xmath18 and evolves such that    @xmath19 \\phi)\\ ] ]    parametrized by @xmath20 to guarantee that @xmath21 is concave down . setting the fixed threshold to 1 , whenever @xmath22 then _ instantaneously _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 , if the edge @xmath24 exists .    integrate - and - fire models have been extremely useful to assess the bursty behavior and the emergence of cascades in neuronal systems represented in lattices @xcite and complex networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to model social systems as a complex network of ifos representing the time evolving ( periodic in this case ) activation of individuals . </S>",
    "<S> the model comprises two free parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath16 , which are closely related . </S>",
    "<S> dissipation @xmath25 may be interpreted as the willingness or _ </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic propensity _ of agents to participate in a certain diffusion event : the larger @xmath25 , the shorter it takes for a node to enter the tip - over interval @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , @xmath16 quantifies the amount of influence an agent exerts onto her neighbors when she shows some activity . </S>",
    "<S> larger @xmath16 s will be more consequential for agents , forcing them more rapidly into the tip - over region . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities affect the level of _ motivation _ @xmath14 of a given agent . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath16 in the current framework maps onto @xmath0 in the classical threshold model , in the sense that both determine the width of the tip - over region . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the phase is translated into time steps , and then prescribed as @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ g1 ] to derive the cascade condition in this new framework . </S>",
    "<S> note that now the distribution of activity is governed by @xmath28 where @xmath29 corresponds to the states probability distribution at a certain time @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> for an initial uniform distribution of motivation @xmath14 and a fixed @xmath16 , the condition for the emergence of cascades reads    @xmath31    and in general for any time ,    @xmath32    which implies that the cascade condition depends on time in our proposed framework . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that , in this scenario , @xmath33 is not a function of the node degree @xmath10 .     </S>",
    "<S> probability distributions of four different representative times along the synchronization window . </S>",
    "<S> each snapshot depicts the @xmath14-state histogram of the @xmath2 oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics begins with a random uniform distribution of @xmath14-states inset ( a) and it progressively narrows during the transition to synchrony inset ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> main : largest fraction of synchronized nodes across time . </S>",
    "<S> the path to synchronization evolves steadily at a low level , and eventually suffers an abrupt transition . ]    </S>",
    "<S> as the dynamics evolve in time , the states of the nodes progressively correlate and , consequently , the distribution of states changes dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the states distribution is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the initially uniform distribution @xmath34 ( inset ( a ) ) evolves towards a dirac @xmath35 function ( inset ( d ) ) as the network approaches global synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> we have not been able to find a closed analytical expression for the consecutive composition of the function @xmath29 after an arbitrary number of time steps to reveal the evolution of @xmath33 , nonetheless it can be solved numerically . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ g3 ] reduces to    @xmath36    the cascade condition is thus    @xmath37    that exactly corresponds to the bond percolation critical point on uncorrelated networks @xcite . for the case of random poisson networks </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 , then @xmath39    we can now explore the cascade condition in the @xmath40 phase diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , and compare the analytical predictions with results from extensive numerical simulations . since the time to full synchronization ( global cascade ) is different for each @xmath40 , we introduce _ </S>",
    "<S> cycles_. one cycle is complete whenever every node in the network has fired at least once . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we bring different time scales to a common , coarse - grained temporal ground , allowing for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the regions where cascades above a prescribed threshold @xmath41 are possible are color - coded for each cycle @xmath42 , and black is used in regions where cascades do not reach @xmath41 ( labeled as n.c . </S>",
    "<S> , `` no cascades '' , in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that if cascades are possible for a cycle @xmath43 , they will be possible also for any @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure renders an interesting scenario : on the one hand , it suggests the existence of critical @xmath45 values below which the cascade condition is systematically frustrated ( black area in the phase diagram ) . on the other , </S>",
    "<S> it establishes how many cycles it takes for a particular @xmath40 pair to attain macroscopical cascades ( full synchronization ) which becomes an attractor thereafter , for undirected connected networks . given the cumulative dynamics of the current framework , in contrast with watts model , the region in which global cascades are possible grows with @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> turning to the social sphere , these results open the door to predicting how long it takes for a given topology , and a certain level of inter - personal influence , to achieve system - wide events . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the existence of a limiting @xmath45 determines whether such events can happen at all .    </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the predictions resulting from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ g5 ] are represented as dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . for the sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we only include predictions for @xmath46 ( dashed black ) , @xmath47 ( dashed gray ) and @xmath48 ( dashed white ) . </S>",
    "<S> projections from this equation run close to numerical results in both homogeneous ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) and inhomogeneous networks ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) , although some deviations exist . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , eq .  [ g5 ] clearly overestimates the existence of macroscopic cascades in the case of scale - free networks at @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath49 does not yet incorporate the inherent dynamical heterogeneity of a scale - free topology , thus eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ g5 ] is a better predictor as the dynamics loose memory of the hardwired initial conditions . in the general case @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> deviations are due to the fact that the analytical approach in the current work is not developed beyond first order . </S>",
    "<S> second order corrections to this dynamics ( including dynamical correlations ) should be incorporated to the analysis in a similar way to that in @xcite , however it is beyond the scope of the current presentation .     </S>",
    "<S> cascade diagram for different cycles ( coded by color ) , with fixed @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> vertical axis and each dashed line define a confined region in which global cascades might occur according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ g5 ] and for a specific cycle ( here we show only the expected zones for @xmath46 dashed white and @xmath48 dashed gray ) . </S>",
    "<S> results are obtained for synthetic erds - rnyi ( a ) and scale - free with @xmath52 ( b ) uncorrelated networks of size @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> a cascade is considered `` macroscopical '' if the synchronized cluster @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> color codes indicate the existence of at least one cascade @xmath55 in numerical simulations ; analytical predictions are averaged over 200 networks with random initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> note that the cascade condition in ( a ) often underestimates the actual cascade regions because it does not take into account second order interactions ; the same applies in the lower panel ( b ) , except for @xmath46 where the analytical prediction overestimates the results because the inclusion of the hub into the cascade is improbable starting from a uniform distribution . ]    </S>",
    "<S> according to mirollo & strogatz @xcite , synchronicity emerges more rapidly when @xmath25 or @xmath16 is large ; then the time taken to synchronize is inversely proportional to the product @xmath56 . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we use this cooperative effect between coupling and willingness to fix @xmath16 , which is set to a set of values ( slightly above or below ) @xmath57 , and use @xmath25 to fine - tune the matching between observed cascade distributions and our synthetic results ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) .    to illustrate the explanatory power of the dynamical threshold model , we use data from www.twitter.com . </S>",
    "<S> they comprise a set of @xmath58 million spanish messages publicly exchanged through this platform from the 25th of april to the 25th of may , 2011 @xcite . in this period </S>",
    "<S> a sequence of civil protests and demonstrations took place , including camping events in the main squares of several cities beginning on the 15th of may and growing in the following days . </S>",
    "<S> notably , a pulse - based model suits well with the affordances of this social network , in which any emitted message is instantly broadcasted to the author s immediate neighborhood its set of _ </S>",
    "<S> followers_. for the whole sample , we queried for the list of followers for each of the emitting users , discarding those who did not show outgoing activity during the period under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the set of users @xmath59 plus their following relations constitute the topological support ( directed network ) for the dynamical process running on top of it . </S>",
    "<S> the average degree of this network is @xmath60 and its degree distribution scales like @xmath61 .    on top of the described network </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the cascade size distribution for different periods as in @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] these periods correspond to the `` slow - growth '' phase ( 25th april to 3rd may ; blue squares in the upper panel ) and to the `` explosive '' phase ( 19th to 25th may ; blue squares in the lower panel ) , which comprehends the most active interval the reaction to the spanish government ban on demonstrations around local elections on the 22nd may . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we run the proposed dynamics on the same topology for different @xmath25 values , with remarkable success ( red circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , an appropriate fitting is attained when @xmath25 is adapted to real - world excitation level : when cascades are measured in an interval around the 15th may , a higher @xmath25 is needed nominating it as a suitable proxy for the system s excitability . additionally , modeling low - activity periods can be achieved just by setting @xmath62 .     and @xmath63 ; last eight days ( bottom ) for which we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath45 varies for different @xmath25 values . </S>",
    "<S> the model performs well in both periods , the relative error of the slope in the linear region is @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> real data distributions are measured as in @xcite . ]    summarizing , we have proposed a time - dependent continuous self - sustained model of social activity . the model can be analyzed in the context of previous cascade models , and encompasses new phenomenology as the time - dependence of the critical value of the emergence of cascades . we interpret it under a social perspective , where collective behavior is seen as an evolving phenomenon resulting from inter - personal influence , contagion and memory . in a general perspective </S>",
    "<S> , our modeling framework offers an alternative approach to the analysis of interdependent decision making and social influence . </S>",
    "<S> it complements threshold models and complex contagion taking into account time dynamics and recursive activation , and also splits motivation into two components : intrinsic propensity and strength of social influence . </S>",
    "<S> we also anticipate that the exploration of the whole parametric space would lead to new insights about the effects of social influence and interdependence in social collective phenomena . </S>"
