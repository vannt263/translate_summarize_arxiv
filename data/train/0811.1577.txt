    "intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath4 ) end their evolution in one of two ways , either exploding as a core - collapse supernova or losing large amounts of material to form a massive white dwarf ( wd ) star .",
    "recent models of massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars suggest that , for stars with initial ( i.e. , zero - age main sequence ) masses @xmath5 , the endpoint of stellar evolution will be a carbon - oxygen ( c / o ) wd . for stars with initial masses",
    "@xmath6 , carbon will burn in a `` super - agb '' star , forming a degenerate oxygen - neon ( one ) core which could become an one wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more massive super - agb stars may explode as electron capture supernovae , and stars with masses @xmath7 explode as canonical core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the initial mass dividing supernova progenitors from white dwarf progenitors , @xmath8 , ( also known as @xmath9 and referred to as @xmath10 in our earlier work ) is therefore likely to lie in this mass range ( @xmath11 ) ; indeed , current super - agb models predict @xmath12 , depending on metallicity and the degree of overshooting .",
    "however , observational constraints on @xmath8  have been slow in coming .",
    "the best published observations give @xmath13 .",
    "tight constraints on @xmath8  are important ; for a burst of star formation with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the number of stars in the mass range of @xmath14 is equal to the number of stars with @xmath15 .",
    "this factor of two uncertainty in the number of supernovae in a starburst region has important implications for quantifying supernova feedback on the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for understanding supernova - driven winds in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of wds provide a lower limit on the value of @xmath8 . in the simplest form",
    ", this limit can be determined by identifying wds in progressively younger star clusters until no wds are found , indicating that the turnoff - mass stars are going supernova instead of forming wd remnants .",
    "variations on this method were used by @xcite and @xcite , who independently determined @xmath16 .",
    "this method is improved upon by using spectroscopic analysis of the wds in each cluster to determine each wd s progenitor mass .",
    "the most massive wd progenitor is then a lower limit on @xmath8 .",
    "such analysis was performed by in the open cluster ngc 2516 , where they found @xmath13 . in our initial study of wds in m35",
    ", we determined @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the relationship of a wd s mass to that of its progenitor , the initial - final mass relation ( ifmr ) , is also a matter of keen interest .",
    "this relationship quantifies the integrated mass lost by a star over its entire evolution , and is therefore a necessary part of understanding chemical enrichment and star formation efficiency in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ifmr represents one of the best observational constraints on agb star mass loss .",
    "these stars are thought to be the primary sites of @xmath18-process production and to play crucial roles in the abundance ratios of helium , carbon , and nitrogen .",
    "due in large part to the steepness of the imf , the ifmr has relatively few points in the high initial mass ( @xmath19 ) region .",
    "four massive wds are known from the open cluster ngc 2516 .",
    "the pleiades provides one to three points , depending on whether the massive wds gd 50 and pg 0136 + 251 were once cluster members @xcite .",
    "age - dating of sirius a has allowed the progenitor mass of sirius b to be calculated @xcite .",
    "a new paper by dobbie2008 identifies three massive wd progenitors in ngc 3532 and two in ngc 2287 .",
    "finally , the older open cluster ngc 2099 has one high - mass wd , albeit with very large error bars on both the initial and final mass @xcite .",
    "it is suspected that the ifmr should have some metallicity dependence , with more metal - rich systems producing lower mass wds .",
    "indeed , the wds in the super - metal - rich cluster ngc 6791 have surprisingly low masses @xcite , though the invoked enhanced mass loss due to the high metallicity results in stars circumventing the agb phase altogether .",
    "comparison of the wd masses in the open star clusters ngc 2099 , the hyades , and praesepe may show some evidence of metallicity dependence @xcite , though this claim hinges on a yet - unpublished significantly sub - solar metallicity measurement for ngc 2099 .",
    "published spectroscopic metallicity measurements for this cluster @xcite claim a solar metallicity or slightly super - solar metallicity for ngc 2099 ; the younger cluster age resulting from a higher metallicity would erase most of the claimed signal .",
    "in short , the metallicity dependence of the ifmr , while expected , has yet to be observed conclusively .    addressing the questions of @xmath8 , the shape of the high - mass end of the ifmr , and any metallicity dependence via observations thus requires wd observations in multiple star clusters that are young ( ages @xmath20 myr ) , relatively rich , and of markedly different metallicities .",
    "the open cluster ngc 2168 ( m35 ) is an ideal laboratory for addressing these issues .",
    "the cluster has an age of @xmath21 myr @xcite and a significantly sub - solar metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath22 @xcite ; newer spectroscopic abundance measurements from the wiyn open cluster study confirm the sub - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath23 ; a.  steinhauer , private communication ) .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we adopt [ fe / h]@xmath24 .",
    "the cluster main - sequence turnoff mass for the cluster is @xmath25 based on the most recent padova stellar evolutionary models .",
    "all cluster wds therefore are the remnants of some of the most massive stars that form wds .",
    "several determinations of the cluster distance modulus and extinction exist in the literature . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have adjusted these published values to our assumed metallicity using the relation of @xcite .",
    "resulting apparent distance moduli @xmath26 include 10.3 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite , and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "published values of the reddening span color excess values of @xmath30 @xcite to @xmath31 @xcite . for this paper , we adopt @xmath32 and @xmath33 as representative of the magnitude of and scatter in these values .",
    "the first search for wds in m35 was undertaken by @xcite , who used photographic images of the cluster to identify four wd candidates .",
    "obtained spectra of three of these stars , confirming that all three are wds and establishing two as likely members . in recent years , deep ccd imaging studies of @xcite and @xcite identified several faint",
    ", blue stars likely to be wds , but these studies lack the spectroscopic observations necessary to determine the wd masses and cooling ages .",
    "therefore , we began our own imaging and spectroscopic study of the wd population of m35 .",
    "in @xcite , we presented initial data on eight da ( hydrogen - atmosphere ) wds in the field of ngc 2168 , seven of which were claimed to be cluster members . in this paper , we present data for an additional six wds , four of which are das , as well as significant additional data on three of the previously - published das .",
    "all of the older data have been completely re - reduced to correct some errors in the initial reduction , to incorporate improvements to the atmospheric fitting routines , and to use the newest wd and stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the fits in this paper therefore supersede those published in @xcite .",
    "initial @xmath34  imaging of m35 was obtained on 2001 september 22 ut using the prime focus camera ( pfcam ) on the lick observatory 3 m shane telescope .",
    "weather was photometric , and seeing was moderate and steady at @xmath35 .",
    "the imaging covered two @xmath36 fields , one centered @xmath37 northeast of the cluster center , and the other @xmath37 southwest of the cluster center . as data from earlier in the night showed evidence for a nonlinear ccd response ( see * ? ? ? * ) , these photometric data are not presented in this paper . however , they were of sufficient quality to identify blue - excess objects as wd candidates for initial spectroscopy .",
    "additional @xmath34  imaging of the cluster was obtained on 2004 january 23 ut with the mosaic-1 camera on the kitt peak mayall 4 m telescope .",
    "weather was photometric and seeing was excellent : @xmath38 in @xmath39 , @xmath40 in @xmath41 , and @xmath42 in @xmath43 .",
    "the mosaic camera , which has a field - of - view of @xmath44 , was centered on the cluster core . in each filter , three long exposures were obtained for a total of 2700s in @xmath43 and 360s in @xmath41 and @xmath39 . between each exposure , a dither of @xmath45 north and east was executed .",
    "single shorter exposures of 30s and 5s were also obtained in each filter .",
    "the mosaic data were reduced using the mscred package of iraf .",
    "we closely followed the prescription formulated for the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) described in online notes by @xcite . in short , we subtracted overscans and trimmed each image , and we combined and subtracted bias frames to remove any residual bias structure .",
    "we also combined and applied dome flat fields in each filter to the science images .",
    "we refined the image world coordinate systems using coordinates from the guide star catalog 2 and projected the images onto the tangent plane , thereby resampling each pixel and correcting for the variable pixel scale .",
    "at this point in reduction we deviated from the ndwfs reduction techniques . in order to obtain the most accurate photometry and to account correctly for chip - to - chip variations in color terms @xcite",
    ", we divided each resampled image into individual subimages for each chip ; each subimage was analyzed independently .",
    "object detection and photometric measurements were performed using the daophot ii suite of analysis programs @xcite and a detection threshold of @xmath46 .",
    "approximately 50 bright , isolated stars were used in each subimage to define a point - spread function ( psf ) ; photometry for each star was determined via psf - fitting .",
    "curve - of - growth analysis of the psf stars determined the aperture corrections used to convert psf magnitudes to total instrumental magnitudes .    the photometric catalogs from each band were then matched to create a final photometric catalog .",
    "stars were required to have been detected on at least one frame in each of the three bandpasses in order to make the final catalog .",
    "due to high background extinction , star - galaxy separation was deemed unnecessary .",
    "calibrations for the mosaic data were determined via imaging of standard star fields from @xcite .",
    "the following transformation equations were used for calibration of the data : +   + @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the total instrumental magnitudes , @xmath49 are the standard system magnitudes , @xmath50 is the exposure time , and @xmath51 is the airmass .",
    "examination of the standard star observation residuals revealed the necessity of the quadratic term in the @xmath43-band transformation .",
    "the number of observed standard stars with extreme colors was fairly small , rendering the value of the quadratic coefficient uncertain .",
    "however , the agreement of the wd @xmath43-band photometry with theoretical values gives us confidence that this value is roughly correct ; solving the transformation equation without the quadratic term leads to observed wd colors in conflict with the evolutionary models .",
    "values for the transformation coefficients are given in table [ tab.photcoeff ] .",
    "ccccc @xmath43 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + @xmath41 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & + @xmath39 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & +    as the number of observed standard stars was insufficient to determine individual color terms for each ccd in the mosaic camera , a single , mean value was determined . for purposes of comparison ,",
    "a second calibration was performed adopting published color terms for each individual ccd @xcite ; the resulting photometry for individual stars in @xmath41 and @xmath39 averaged 0.01 mag fainter with a dispersion of 0.01 mag . as @xcite did not use a quadratic term in the @xmath43-band transformation , direct comparison of @xmath43-band terms",
    "is not possible , but @xcite note the chip - to - chip color - term variation introduces a scatter of @xmath62 mag over a 1 mag range in .     and @xmath39-band photometry , while our   colors are systematically bluer for hotter stars .",
    "[ fig.sung ] ]    as a further sanity check , we compare our photometry with previous ccd photometry of m35 from @xcite , shown in figure [ fig.sung ] .",
    "we find no systematic offsets in the @xmath41 or @xmath39 photometry at @xmath63 mag levels .",
    "however , a significant systematic trend is observable in @xmath43 : for the bluest objects , we obtain @xmath43 magnitudes systematically brighter by @xmath64 mag .",
    "it is unclear if this systematic is intrinsic to our data , perhaps indicative that the color terms in eq .",
    "[ eqn.u ] are a poor approximation to the true color response ( see discussions of  photometry in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if the systematic is intrinsic to the @xcite data , or both .",
    "the @xmath65 and @xmath66 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the stars in the field of m35 are shown in figure [ fig.init_cmd ] .",
    "overplotted is the padova isochrone for a @xmath67 ( @xmath68}=-0.2 $ ] for the traditional solar abundances of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 200-myr - old stellar population shifted to the adopted cluster distance and reddening ( see  [ sec.intro.m35 ] ) .",
    "the isochrone is found to be an excellent representation of the main sequence for @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) in the  cmd .",
    "the same @xmath67 , 200-myr isochrone is too blue in the  cmd ; agreement for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) can be reached by increasing the reddening to @xmath73 .",
    "such a change in reddening throws off the observed agreement in the  cmd .",
    "this suggests either a non - standard reddening law in the direction of m35 , a significant error in our @xmath43-band zeropoint ( in a direction which would worsen the systematic offset mentioned in the previous section ) , or a problem with the isochrone @xmath43-band calculations .",
    "additional data and analysis are needed to explore this discrepancy further .",
    "a comparison of our data with @xmath74 and @xmath75 padova isochrones finds that the observed main sequence agrees with the isochrone if the distance modulus of the cluster is shifted 0.15 mag closer or further , respectively . as with the @xmath67 isochrone , the  cmd requires a higher assumed reddening value to bring the isochrone and main sequence into agreement .",
    "the observed main sequence is also in excellent agreement with the empirical zero - age main sequence of , shifted to the adopted cluster distance and reddening , and with the fiducial m35 main sequence of @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that our photometry is consistent with the literature - based distance , reddening , and metallicity we adopted in  [ sec.intro.m35 ] .",
    "we emphasize that , as our photometric data saturate well below the main sequence turnoff , our main sequence data are not useful for age determination .",
    "the cmds spanning the entire magnitude range of our photometry are shown in figure [ fig.init_cmd ] along with cooling curves for hydrogen - atmosphere ( da ) and helium - atmosphere ( db ) wds for a range of wd masses , all shifted to the adopted cluster distance modulus and reddening .",
    "several faint , blue objects are seen in the region of the cmd that should be populated by cluster wds .",
    "the @xmath76 color - color plot ( figure [ fig.init_cc ] ) more clearly shows those objects with colors consistent with wd cooling models .",
    "candidate wds are selected using the criteria @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "these criteria would include all wds at the cluster distance and reddening except for the hottest low - mass ( @xmath80k ) wds .",
    "these criteria are indicated in figures  [ fig.init_cmd ] and [ fig.init_cc ] ; candidate wds selected via these criteria indicated as larger solid points in the cmds and color - color plot .",
    "coordinates , photometry , and cross - identifications for each candidate wd are given in table [ tab.cands ] .",

    "the cluster age was adopted from literature using isochrone - fitting methods employing different stellar evolutionary models ; the wd evolutionary models do not use the chemical profiles output by the same stellar models used to determine the cluster age ; and the atmospheric models used to fit the spectra are not identical to those used in the wd evolutionary models",
    ". however , as pointed out by @xcite , the overwhelming source of systematic error in ifmr calculations is from the uncertainty in the cluster age ( see  [ sec.discuss.errors.age ] ) .",

    "our linear fit is formally inconsistent with the slopes of the fits given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; the m35 wds at the high - mass end of the relation prefer a steeper slope .",
    "however , the goodness - of - fit statistic for all of these linear fits ( including the new fits presented here ) are very low .",
    "this could indicate that the error bars on the wd parameters are understated , that there is an additional scatter not due to measurement error ( such as intrinsic scatter in the relation ) , and/or that a linear function is not an appropriate representation of the data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". in any of these cases , the formal error bars on the slope and zero point of the linear fit quoted above are likely understated .",
    "qualitatively , all of these linear fits appear to be a decent approximation to the data .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the empirical ifmr may not be strictly linear ; emergent hints of a non - linear ifmr have been discussed recently in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formal significance of these non - linear fits is limited by the larger error bars in massive wds ( driven by cluster age uncertainties and the steep change in the relationship between stellar mass and lifetimes at these younger ages ) and the limited amount of data at the low @xmath172  end of the relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "although several systematic effects may affect the ifmr , by far the largest systematic in m35 is the uncertainty in the cluster age .",
    "errors in the cluster age affect the ifmr in two distinct ways .",
    "first , an increase ( decrease ) in the assumed cluster age will result in _ all _ wds from a given cluster having lower ( higher ) derived initial masses .",
    "second , a change in the cluster age results in a larger shift for cluster wds with higher progenitor masses , as the change in age represents a larger fraction of the main sequence lifetime for these stars .    both of these effects can be illustrated in the m35 empirical ifmr .",
    "figure [ fig.ifmr_age ] shows the empirical ifmr for three different assumed ages of m35 : 150 myr , 175 myr , and 200 myr .",
    "the figure illustrates that , for older assumed ages , the cluster points shift systematically to lower @xmath172 .",
    "the slope of the cluster ifmr also steepens significantly with increasing assumed cluster ages .",
    "the conclusions drawn from comparison of the m35 ifmr to that of other clusters will differ depending on the assumed cluster age .",
    "if the cluster age is 150 myr , the cluster ifmr agrees extraordinarily well with the empirical ifmr derived from other clusters .",
    "yet if the cluster age is 200 myr , one would conclude that the cluster wds are systematically more massive than those in other young clusters , perhaps indicative of metallicity - dependent mass loss rates .",
    "these same systematics affect attempts to calculate the intrinsic scatter in the ifmr . for a younger m35",
    ", the scatter at a given @xmath172  would be explained by the intrinsic observational errors . yet for an older cluster , the intrinsic scatter would be significant .",
    "this systematic is most severe in young clusters ; for old open clusters , the uncertainty in the cluster age is small relative to the progenitor star lifetimes .",
    "for example , the 1 gyr ( @xmath209 ) uncertainty in the age of ngc 6791 results in just a 0.05@xmath131  change in @xmath172  for its wds , compared with the @xmath210 uncertainty in @xmath172  for the m35 wds for the cluster age uncertainty of just 25 myr ( also @xmath209 ) .",
    "observational lower limits on the maximum mass of wd progenitors , @xmath8 , can be determined from ifmr . to zeroth order ,",
    "this can be accomplished by simply identifying the wd with the highest @xmath172  in the empirical ifmr . however , this approach is complicated by numerous uncertainties . first , the sizes of the error bars on individual wds are large enough that it is not possible to identify the single wd with the highest @xmath172 .",
    "second , the errors on @xmath172  of individual wds are asymmetric and non - analytic , complicating any effort to simply calculate limits on @xmath8 .",
    "third , the wds with the highest @xmath172   come from numerous star clusters , each of which will have its own unique systematic errors in @xmath172  due to the cluster age uncertainties .",
    "we therefore elect to use a monte carlo simulation to determine the lower observational limits on @xmath8 .",
    "the simulation creates 25000 realizations of the observed wd population in the open clusters m35 , the pleiades ( including gd 50 and pg 0136 + 251 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc 2516 , ngc 3532 , ngc 2287 , and sirius b ; wds from older open clusters are excluded because they either have such low @xmath172  or such large error bars that they do not contribute to the limits on @xmath8 .",
    "for each realization , each open cluster is a assigned an age randomly drawn from the values quoted in table [ tab.cldata ] ; as the published errors in cluster ages tend to indicate acceptable ranges rather than a normal distribution about the best value , cluster ages are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution .",
    "additionally , in each realization a @xmath133  and @xmath134  are assigned to each known wd , with values drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of the observed @xmath133  and @xmath134  for the wd , and a standard deviation equal to the stated random errors in each quantity.the assigned @xmath133  and @xmath134are then used to determine @xmath172  for each wd ; if the cooling age of the simulated wd is older than the cluster age , that wd is ignored for that particular realization .",
    "for each realization , the highest overall @xmath172  is identified as the lower limit on @xmath8  for that realization .",
    "we perform six runs on this monte carlo simulation with varying parameters .",
    "three different wd populations are tested :    * only the wds in ngc 2168 ; this limits the number of systematics involved in the simulation , but provides the loosest limits on @xmath8 , * all da wds in the five open clusters mentioned in the previous paragraph as well as sirius b ; this data set represents all available useful cluster data , and * the previous sample minus three wds of uncertain cluster membership : ngc 2168 lawds 11 ( see  [ sec.discuss.members ] ) , and gd 50 and pg 0136 + 251 , as their common space motion with the pleiades does not prove they were born simultaneously with the cluster .",
    "each of these three wd populations was paired with two variations on wd core composition . in the first instance , all wds are assumed to have carbon - oxygen cores ; in the second , any wds with @xmath211 are assumed to have oxygen - neon cores ( see  [ sec.discuss.massive ] ) .",

    "* ) , it may be reasonable to assert that @xmath216 with 95% confidence for stars near solar - metallicity .",
    "however , a more careful analysis of both the wd and supernova data is needed before these constraints can be claimed with confidence .",
    "the primary sources of systematic error in these simulations are from the input star cluster ages and the input stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the input ages are all determined from evolutionary models including moderate convective overshoot , and so are reasonably consistently determined despite coming from a multitude of published sources and methods .",
    "however , there is a well - known degeneracy between an observed cluster s age , metallicity , and distance ; a significant change in the age of any of the clusters used in this simulation would change the results . and ,",
    "as stellar models continue to evolve , the derived ages for the entire cluster sample may change systematically .",
    "these same evolutionary models are used to convert the wd progenitor lifetime into @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , any significant changes in the output lifetimes for intermediate - mass stars would also significantly impact these results . however , moderate levels of convective overshoot have become generally accepted in the community and appear to be borne out by observations .",
    "how large a difference could future changes to evolutionary models make ? according to the padova isochrones , a solar - metallicity model including moderate convective overshoot with a lifetime of 100 myr has a mass of 5.42@xmath131 , and a mass of 5.18@xmath131  with no convective overshoot .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that our derived limits will change by @xmath217 due to a choice of evolutionary models alone .",
    "larger changes are possible , though , depending on how newer evolutionary models affect the input star cluster ages .",
    "another possible source of error is due to our combination of data from star clusters of differing metallicity ; namely , ngc 2168 is significantly subsolar metallicity , while the remaining clusters and sirius are close to solar metallicity . numerous models of super - agb stars exhibit a dependence of @xmath8  on metallicity .",
    "though these models differ significantly on the precise value of @xmath8 , they predict that @xmath8  for stars with the metallicity of ngc 2168 should be systematically @xmath218 to 0.3@xmath131  lower than for solar - metallicity stars .",
    "we note that incompleteness in the wd sample can not reduce our lower limits on @xmath8 ; additional wds can only raise the lower limit .",
    "the distance modulus and reddening we have adopted for m35 @xmath219 , @xmath220 $ ] are based solely on previously - published main - sequence fitting derivations .",
    "as the spectral fits to each wd , when combined with the wd photometry , provide a measure on the distance modulus and reddening for each wd , we can use the ensemble averages of these individual measurements as an independent determination of the cluster distance and reddening .",
    "again , due to the uncertainty in its spectral parameters , we do not include lawds 22 in these calculations .",
    "the weighted means of the individual distance moduli give a mean wd distance modulus of @xmath2 , with a dispersion of @xmath221 mag .",
    "the mean color excesses are @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 , @xmath225 .",
    "the mean cluster wd distance modulus and @xmath226  are therefore fully consistent with the values determined from main - sequence fitting ; the ratio @xmath227 is consistent with the milky way reddening law of @xcite for @xmath228 .    the measured scatter in the measured color excesses is larger than the uncertainties in the individual measurements ( see table [ tab.modphot ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is a significant correlation between the individual wd distance moduli and the @xmath226   color excess .",
    "these two effects could be explained by differential interstellar extinction across the cluster .",
    "if we `` correct '' each distance modulus to the mean @xmath226   color excess , the dispersion in the distance moduli drops to @xmath229 mag .    however , there is no obvious spatial correlation between wds with similar measured @xmath226 .",
    "in addition , errors in the measured @xmath133   will mimic extinction effects . if the measured @xmath133   is higher than the actual value , then the derived wd absolute magnitude will be too bright , resulting in too large of a measured distance modulus . at the same time , the derived model color will be bluer than the actual wd , resulting in an artificially large measured @xmath226 .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is essentially identical to the stated errors in the @xmath226   and @xmath230 measurements in table [ tab.modphot ] .",
    "therefore , the errors in @xmath133   can explain most , but not all , of the observed scatter in the @xmath226   and @xmath230 values .",
    "four m35 wds , lawds 2 , lawds 14 , lawds 27 , and lawds 30 , have masses within @xmath231 of 1.05@xmath131 , the lower mass of one core wds that may be produced by super - agb stars . for this reason , we have also calculated @xmath164  and @xmath172  for these stars using the one wd evolutionary models of .",
    "the one models reduce @xmath172  by @xmath232 for all four wds .",
    "the decrease in @xmath172  is due primarily to the lower heat capacity of one cores , which allow the one - core wds to cool more rapidly than c / o - core wds of the same mass .    from our data",
    ", we have no means of knowing if these two wds have carbon - oxygen or oxygen - neon cores . however , stellar evolutionary models of the @xmath233 progenitors of these wds suggest that they should have c / o cores .",
    "claims have been made that a lack of db wds exists in younger open clusters @xcite .",
    "several non - da wds are known to exist in the field of younger open clusters , including lp 475 - 252 ( spectral type dba in the hyades ) , ngc 2168 : lawds 28 ( the hot dq in this cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc 1039:lawds 26 , and ngc 6633:lawds 16 @xcite , though only lp 475@xmath234252 has been confirmed as a cluster member via proper motion .",
    "we have identified one db wd in the field of m35 , lawds 4 .",
    "if this is a cluster member , it would make m35 the youngest open star cluster with a db wd member ( noting again that m35 contains the non - da lawds 28 ) .",
    "is lawds 4 a cluster member ? at present , the low signal - to - noise of the spectrum precludes a robust spectral fit .",
    "however , we can estimate its @xmath133 .",
    "the weakness of the helium absorption lines , the spectral slope , and the colors are all consistent with a fairly cool ( @xmath235k ) db wd . based on cooling models provided by p.  bergeron ,",
    "this db could only be this cool and still be younger than m35 if it has a relatively low mass ( @xmath236 ) .    if we assume a wd mass of 0.4@xmath131  to 0.6@xmath131  and @xmath237k , the apparent distance modulus of lawds 4 is between 10.24 and 10.77 , consistent with the cluster distance modulus .",
    "in other words , this db is photometrically consistent with cluster membership , under the assumption that its mass is @xmath236 .",
    "if lawds 4 is a cluster member , its progenitor mass would have to be high ( @xmath238 ) , yet the wd mass ( @xmath239 ) lies well below the empirical initial - final mass relation , possible under a binary formation scenario for the wd .",
    "it is also possible , and perhaps probable , that this star is a field wd located near the cluster .",
    "accurate , precise proper motion measurements for this wd will likely be necessary to clarify its cluster membership , and a higher signal - to - noise spectrum is needed to determine its @xmath133  and @xmath134 .",
    "clearly , this star warrants further study .",
    "in this paper , we have presented observations and analysis of the white dwarf population of the open star cluster m35 .",
    "our conclusions are the following .",
    "* spectroscopy of 14 white dwarf candidates identifies 12 da , 1 db , and 1 hot dq wds . temperatures , surface gravities , masses , and cooling ages are derived for each of the da wds . *",
    "all twelve das are potentially cluster member wds , with distance moduli consistent with that of the cluster and cooling ages less than the cluster age .",
    "the hot dq and db are also consistent with being cluster members .",
    "further data , such as proper motion measurements , are necessary to confirm the cluster membership of each star . *",
    "the empirical initial - final mass relation from the m35 white dwarf population is consistent with the roughly linear relation derived from other open star clusters . *",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty in the empirical initial - final mass relation of m35 is the uncertainty in the star cluster age . in the absence of tighter age constraints",
    ", we can not draw robust conclusions on the intrinsic scatter and metallicity - dependence of the initial - final mass relation . * based on m35 wds alone , the lower limit on the maximum mass of wd progenitor stars ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath240 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "inclusion of wds from other young open clusters raises this lower limit to @xmath241 , depending on the membership of certain massive white dwarfs and the core composition of the most massive wds .",
    "combined with upper limits on @xmath8  from supernova surveys , @xmath242 for solar - metallicity stars . *",
    "based on the cluster wds alone , we derive a distance modulus to m35 of @xmath2 and reddening of @xmath243 , both in agreement with published values derived from main sequence fitting . *",
    "four of the das have masses that are sufficiently massive that they may possess oxygen - neon cores .",
