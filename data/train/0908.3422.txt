    "in the last few years , the study of microsystems that involve the interaction between an active medium and confined light , has made possible the observation of interesting phenomena in two dynamical regimes : weak and strong coupling @xcite . in the first regime , spontaneous emission control",
    "was successfully realized ( purcell effect ) @xcite ; in the second one , several groups are now searching for coherent polaritonic phenomena such as lasing @xcite or condensation @xcite , which can open applications in quantum information and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "in addition , some recent theoretical works have shown that the dynamical properties for a coupled quantum dot - cavity system , may be described using a simple dissipative model @xcite . +",
    "our purpose in this work is to study the relations between weak and strong coupling regimes with the dynamical exciton - photon entanglement , by using the concurrence measure and the wigner quasiprobability function . despite the fact that the wigner function depends only on the photonic state",
    ", it has been shown that it can be used as a qualitative criterion for determining the separability of the quantum exciton - photon state @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite a similar study has been carried out but studying 2 quantum dots and only in the stationary limit .",
    "+ the paper has been written as follows : section [ sec02 ] contains the theoretical framework supporting our model , in section [ sec02:sub01 ] we describe the system and the dissipative processes that models its dynamics using a master equation . in section [ sec02:sub02 ]",
    "we explain how the photoluminescence   spectrum is obtained by using the quantum regression theorem . in section [ sec02:sub03 ] , using a simple phenomenological model we include temperature effects in the quantum dot gap . in section [ sec02:sub04 ]",
    "we review the concurrence and wigner function concepts , and their connection with the photon - exciton entanglement .",
    "hence , the dynamical regimes are characterized employing the numerical integration results of the master equation for two different cutoff conditions in the photon number , in both cases , showing a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "once the regime is characterized , a dynamical description of the entanglement is analyzed and we show collapses and revivals of this quantity as a function of the dissipative parameters involved in the model . furthermore , we establish the usefulness of the wigner function criterion to detect separability in a multi - state system where the concurrence criterion can not be used . finally , some conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of a quantum dot interacting with a confined mode of the electromagnetic field inside a semiconductor microcavity . in these systems , quantum states associated to the matter excitations , the so - called excitons , are bound states resultant of the coulomb interaction between electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band .",
    "this quasi - particle exhibits a complete discrete excitation spectrum , however , in this work we will only consider the first two levels of this set , the ground @xmath0 ( no excitation , i.e , electron in the valence band ) and excited @xmath1 ( exciton ) states .",
    "this assumption is based upon the fact that the ground and first excited states of a multilevel model involving coulomb interaction , are mainly filled in the dynamical evolution of the system @xcite . a possible experimental realization of this model ,",
    "can be implemented in a pumped system with polarized light @xcite and slow spin flip mechanisms .",
    "the photonic component will be treated as a single electromagnetic mode .",
    "the validity of this usual assumption is subjected to the existence of well separated modes in energy inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "the last condition amounts to say that for example the radii of the micropillar is small since the energy separation of the modes increases when the radii is decreased .",
    "we will employ a fock state basis @xmath2 , which ought to be truncated in order to implement computationally the dynamics .",
    "+ light - matter interaction is described by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are exciton ladder operators and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for photons . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the exciton and photon energy , respectively , and @xmath10 is the coupling constant and we have set @xmath11 .",
    "+ we also define the detuning between the exciton and photon frequency as @xmath12 . under these considerations",
    "the system is hamiltonian and completely integrable @xcite .",
    "however , real physical systems are far away from this simple description ; dissipative effects play an important role in the evolution of the system .",
    "indeed , if no losses were considered in the system , no measurements could be done since light would remain always inside the microcavity .",
    "the whole system - reservoir hamiltonian can be splitted in three parts .",
    "one is for the system we are considering , namely , the photons of the cavity and the exciton .",
    "the second one is the hamiltonian of the reservoirs , which is made of electron - hole pairs , photons and phonons and finally a third part which is a bilinear coupling between the system and the reservoirs .",
    "the explicit form of the system - reservoir interaction for this model can be found in @xcite . after tracing over the external reservoirs degrees of freedom and assuming the validity of the born - markov approximation , which requires weak coupling between the system ( exciton+cavity photons ) and the reservoirs one arrives to a master equation .",
    "it has recently been found @xcite that non - markovian dynamics is relevant for high pumping intensities .",
    "+ the master equation we have found accounts for three different processes , namely , coherent emission ( @xmath13 ) , external pumping ( @xmath14 ) and spontaneous emission ( @xmath15 ) . the master equation we shall consider is @xcite :    @xmath16 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2 }    ( 2a\\rho a^\\dag - a^\\dag a\\rho -\\rho a^\\dag a ) +    \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(2\\sigma \\rho \\sigma^\\dag - \\sigma^\\dag \\sigma \\rho    - \\rho \\sigma^\\dag \\sigma ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & +    \\frac{p}{2}(2\\sigma^\\dag \\rho \\sigma - \\rho \\sigma \\sigma ^\\dag - \\sigma \\sigma^\\dag \\rho    ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by changing the values of the free parameters in this model , two different dynamical regimes are reached : weak and strong coupling .",
    "possible transitions between these two regimes , can be achieved as loss and pump rates are modified .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the system as well as the size of the basis employed are governed by the competition of the time scales involved in the model .",
    "the time scales associated with the non conservative processes included are given by : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , whereas , the interaction time scale is @xmath20 .",
    "we address now to the interpretation of these time scales . in figure [ timescales ] three possible cases",
    "are shown whose dynamics can be described using a basis including up to one photon ( cases ( a ) and ( b ) ) and more than one photon ( case ( c ) ) .    in case ( a ) , for instance , the relation @xmath21 holds , and the system is operating in weak coupling regime .",
    "when an _ exciton _ is pumped during the typical time scale @xmath22 , the elapsed time until it recombines into a _",
    "photon _ is given by the ( largest ) scale @xmath23 .",
    "bear in mind that throughout this period no further excitation can be done over the quantum dot , because the pauli exclusion principle does not allow an additional excitation .",
    "the photon generated in this way , quickly leaves the cavity due to the small time scale @xmath24 in which it can inhabit the cavity .",
    "the latter mechanism applies for any photon living the cavity .",
    "hence we see that there is no chance for rabi oscillations in the dynamical evolution .",
    "if the initial condition for the electromagnetic field is the vacuum state , the photon mean number is never expected to be greater than one .",
    "+ a similar reasoning can be done in the case ( b ) , where @xmath25 . in this case",
    "each photon created by the interaction can be re - absorbed and produce rabi oscillations ( i.e. , strong coupling ) , before it leaves the cavity .",
    "a basis including up to one photon is enough to describe the system because the characteristic time related to losses is by much smaller than the pump one .",
    "the important issue here is that the dynamical situation is clearly different to the previous one .",
    "+ finally , in case ( c ) , where @xmath26 , we have a situation in which the photons can be efficiently stored within the cavity .",
    "indeed , since the coherent emission rate is small , its characteristic time scale is large enough compared with the associated excitonic pump and interaction rates .",
    "photons created by exciton recombination remain in the cavity a long time before they leak through the cavity mirrors .",
    "this case is a clear example where the multiphoton basis must be implemented .",
    "+     schematic diagram of some relations among the typical time scales associated with the effective rates involved in the master equation .",
    "cases ( a ) and ( b ) show situations in which the basis containing up to one photon is enough for describing the dynamics . on the other hand , case ( c ) shows a set of parameters where this description fails , and the requirement for a larger basis arises . see the text for additional details . ]",
    "the fourier transform of the first order correlation function directly gives the photoluminescence   spectrum of the system @xcite ,    @xmath27    note that in this expression a knowledge of the time - dependent expected value for the product of creation and annihilation operators , is needed in order to compute the photoluminescence   spectrum .",
    "however , non analytical expression for such expectation value is available for our system .",
    "this problem can be solved by representing the operators @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in the interaction picture , and then using the quantum regression theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that given a set of operators @xmath28 satisfying ,    @xmath29    then    @xmath30    for any operator @xmath31 .",
    "the validity of this theorem holds whenever a closed set of operators are involved in the dynamics in the markovian approximation .",
    "unfortunately , representing creation and annihilation operators in the interaction picture does not lead to a complete set .",
    "it is necessary to add two new operators in order to close the system .",
    "the final set of equations for the operators are :    @xmath32    in the framework of the previous discussion regarding the dynamical time scales , we can consider the simplest model involving all dissipative and interaction processes , that is , we shall study a problem having just three levels : @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "taking into account this consideration we only need to define two operators whose dynamical equations are :    @xmath36    thus by using the quantum regression theorem we can write the dynamics for the delayed operators as , @xmath37    the last linear system has the following formal solution    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath41 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath42 are directly related with the peaks @xmath43 and widths @xmath44 of the spectrum ,    @xmath45      in order to make a more realistic description of the experimental data we also include a temperature dependence in the model .",
    "it is important to explicitly point out that the developed master equation describes the system at zero temperature , that is , the states of the reservoirs considered in the derivation of the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) are zero temperature states .",
    "this assumption can be justified as follows .",
    "first notice that when a finite temperature reservoir of photons is considered in the derivation of the master equation one obtains two lindblad terms @xcite .",
    "one that accounts for thermally induced absorption and that is proportional to the average number of photons of the reservoir and another term that is proportional to the average number of photons of the reservoir _ plus one _ and that accounts for spontaneous emission .",
    "the average number of photons of a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "the standard experimental values for the photon energy in a micropillar are @xmath48 mev whereas for temperatures of the order of @xmath49 k the thermal energy @xmath50 mev and thus the average number of photons is @xmath51 .",
    "we see that effects due to finite temperature in the master equation for the system considered here are quite small .",
    "+ summarizing , the above discussion , we can add thermal effects on the system through its effective parameters , such as the quantum dot energy gap and the cavity refractive index , without considering the fundamental issues introduced into the model by the dephasing processes .",
    "first , let us consider the temperature photon energy dependence .",
    "usual microcavities are built from gaas / algaas layers , for these cavities the resonant wavelength depends on the refractive index as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the light wavelength in vacuum .",
    "we can then modify the resonant frequency by changing the refractive index @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown that this index has an almost linear temperature dependence within the range from 0 k up to few hundred kelvin . in reference",
    "@xcite has been shown that the refractive index can be modeled with the simple formulae :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 k@xmath57 .",
    "it is seen that the corrections to the wavelength due to the temperature are rather small , and because of this will not be considered in this work .",
    "on the other hand , the temperature effects , related to the active medium can be included through the energy gap in the quantum dot .",
    "we shall use here the varshni model @xcite , which fits the band gap thermal dependence in the low temperature region . a more detailed discussion about the validity of this model , can be found in reference @xcite ,    @xmath58    in this work we will use two different sets of experimental data for ingaas quantum dots , for which the varshni parameters were fitted .",
    "determining entanglement between two quantum mechanical systems is a complicated task when the systems involved have several degrees of freedom , that is , when the basis representing the density matrix has more than two pairs of states .",
    "however , if each system is completely described with two levels ( i.e. each system is a _ qubit _ ) the situation becomes easier ; indeed , the _ entanglement _ can be obtained from the _ concurrence _ expression @xcite ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 are the square root of the decreasingly ordered eigenvalues of the positive - definite non - hermitian matrix @xmath61 with ,    @xmath62    and @xmath63 is the complex conjugated matrix representation of @xmath64 in some suitable basis .",
    "+ for instance , note that if our system is described by using the basis @xmath65 , ( where @xmath66 are photon fock states ) , the exciton - photonic field system can be thought as two interacting qubits .",
    "once a ( numerical ) solution of the master equation is obtained , it is straightforward to compute the concurrence following the previous recipe .",
    "it is to be noticed that the validity of this basis is constrained to the dynamical regime where this cutoff holds .",
    "when the basis is larger than the one considered earlier , the concurrence measure is not applicable and hence a new criterion must be established . despite the wigner function only depends on the photon state , it has been demonstrated that it yields qualitative information about the separability between the exciton and photon parts of the global quantum state @xcite .",
    "the wigner function for the photonic field can be easily computed as @xcite ,    @xmath67,\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 is the field parity operator and @xmath69 is the displacement operator , @xmath70 is the density operator of the photons and @xmath71 is the trace operation in fock space .",
    "our system involves both excitonic and photonic states , hence this definition is not directly applicable , and a previous differentiation among the possible combinations has to be done , that is , we have to separately consider the wigner matrix elements @xmath72 @xcite ,    @xmath73,\\ ] ]    where indexes @xmath74 run over excitonic states @xmath75 , and @xmath64 is the density operator of the whole system .",
    "notice that @xmath76 is an operator that acts only in the state space of the photons so that the operations in the above equation are well defined .",
    "note that if the system is separable at a given time then the matrix elements @xmath77 and @xmath78 have the same shape in phase space , leading to a separable system , which is itself related to a vanishing concurrence situation .",
    "indeed , recognizing that each fock state has a well defined signature within the phase space , it is possible to identify the predominant photonic state by observing the wigner function .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that if the quantum state is separable , @xmath79 then the corresponding wigner function of the system can be written as @xcite    @xmath80    where @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , if the system is separable at a given time all the matrix elements @xmath72 of the wigner matrix have the same shape for every @xmath74 .",
    "in opposition to the quantitative concurrence measure , the wigner function only shows qualitative information about the entanglement .",
    "in the weak coupling ( wc ) regime the relation @xcite    @xmath82    holds , hence by selecting a strong enough emission rate wc is obtained .",
    "we choose @xmath83 @xmath84ev , @xmath85 @xmath84ev , @xmath86 @xmath84ev and @xmath87 @xmath84ev corresponding to the case ( a ) of figure [ timescales ] .",
    "as we stated before , this situation can be described with the reduced basis including up to one photon .",
    "+ we stress that relation ( [ wccond ] ) is derived under the assumption that there is no incoherent pumping over the system .",
    "the effects of the pumping have been studied in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "we have taken a photon decay rate of @xmath86 @xmath84ev and a cavity mode of frequency @xmath88 mev , so that the quality factor of the cavity we are considering is @xmath89 .",

    "notice for example that in figure [ fig:7 ] panel ( e ) the concurrence vanishes for precisely the times when @xmath132 and that the difference between the concurrence and @xmath133 in their minima grows as the coherence @xmath134 grows as seen in panel ( f ) . in the dynamics of the density matrix we are considering it",
    "is seen that the coherences decay exponentially with rates proportional to @xmath135 and that on the other hand @xmath14 tends to increase the population of @xmath131 and @xmath13 tends to increase the population of @xmath130 so that the difference @xmath136 does not distinguish the two processes .",
    "+ even more interesting is the fact that as the dissipation increases the zones where concurrence vanishes ( the so called entanglement sudden death @xcite ) become wider , revivals in the concurrence become more separated as dissipation increases . note that when dissipation increases the maxima of the concurrence are less defined and eventually disappear . in order to quantify these two effects",
    "we compute the temporal length of the first two collapses of the concurrence ( @xmath137 is the time interval of the first collapse and @xmath138 the time interval of the second one ) .",
    "the results obtained are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that as the non hamiltonian effects become important the length of both intervals gets longer and that for any @xmath13 and @xmath14 the second interval @xmath138 is wider than the first one @xmath137 .",
    "this behavior can be understood as follows : as explained in the last paragraph the degree of entanglement between the subsystems is the difference @xmath136 and the dynamical behavior of the coherence term is an oscillatory function times an exponential decaying function with decay rate proportional to the sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in order to have entanglement",
    "the absolute value of @xmath133 must be greater than @xmath134 .",
    "now notice that as @xmath14 or @xmath13 are increased the oscillations gets more damped .",
    "because of the damping the amplitude of the oscillations is smaller and the absolute value of the coherence has to be in a time @xmath139 closer to a maxima in order to be greater than @xmath134 , that is , the finite time where there is no entanglement approaches to the time interval between to successive maxima of @xmath133 as @xmath13 or @xmath14 is increased .",
    "to understand the fact that the first interval of sudden death @xmath137 is smaller than the second one @xmath138 , simply notice that for the times in the second interval the amplitude of @xmath133 will be smaller than in the first one , so that the times when the entanglement will be different from zero will be closer to the maxima of @xmath133 resulting in a wider interval .",
    "this behavior suggest that by manipulating experimentally accessible parameters such as the pumping rate and the quality factor of the cavity one can in principle make coherence control in the system .",
    "finally , it is worth to mention that due to the coupling with external reservoirs the system evolves to a non pure state as evidenced in figure ( [ fig:7 ] ) where we plot the linear entropy .",
    "now we compute the elements of the wigner function @xmath78 and @xmath77 ( see fig .  [ fig:9 ] ) in representative zones of the concurrence function for typical values of the parameters : @xmath140 @xmath84ev and @xmath141 @xmath84ev , at the times @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 indicated in figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "note that in the regions where concurrence goes to zero , phase space is similar ( up to a multiplicative constant ) as suggested by @xmath77 , @xmath78 , re@xmath142 and im@xmath142 , so that the photonic states are similar for both ground and excited excitonic states and hence the photonic states are separable from the excitonic part leading to a vanishing entanglement . on the other hand for non vanishing concurrence",
    "it is clear that photonic states can not be separated .",
    "we have built a phenomenological model that is able to describe both weak and strong coupling an that accounts for _ temperature _ effects in a microcavity quantum dot system .",
    "we have used concurrence criterion and the wigner function to carry out the entanglement analysis related with the dynamical regimes in a simple dissipative model .",
    "the strong coupling regime shows a periodical disentanglement that depends on the dissipation rates . on the other hand",
    ", the weak coupling regime shows no complete dynamical losing of entanglement .",
    "this relation between dynamical regimes and entanglement sudden death has been investigated and we have shown that on the one hand both the coherent emission ( @xmath13 ) and the incoherent pumping ( @xmath14 ) affect the time windows where there is no entanglement . in the same way , as time goes by this windows become wider due to the damping in the dynamics of the non diagonal terms of the density matrix caused by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "+ finally , we would like to point out that our results suggest that one can control the entanglement between the subsystems by manipulating external parameters such as the pumping rate @xmath14 and the cavity quality factor ( which is related to the emission rate @xmath13 ) .",
