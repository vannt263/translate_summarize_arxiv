    "there are two mechanisms by which pressure increases doping in ybco .",
    "the first has to do with the re - arrangement of oxygen atoms in the cuo chains .",
    "pressure improves the degree of oxygen order . with oxygen ordering",
    "comes an enhanced charge transfer between cuo chains and cuo@xmath8 planes , and hence an increased doping of holes into the planes .",
    "this has been studied in detail ( e.g. @xcite ) , and there are two approaches to eliminate this ordering process : 1 ) apply pressure at a temperature of 200 k or lower ; 2 ) use samples that already have a high degree of oxygen order .    in table s2 , we collect data on the suppression of @xmath19with pressure @xmath46 , specifically the rate @xmath59 , only for those studies that have used one or the other of these approaches to ensure that no oxygen relaxation effects take place .",
    "for dopings higher than @xmath97 , in the range where no superstructure is favoured , these precautions are not necessary . to the long list of published data ,",
    "we add three data points we have taken ourselves on oxygen - ordered samples ( table s2 ) :            the second mechanism by which pressure increases doping is one that can not be avoided . by bringing the chains closer to the planes ,",
    "charge transfer is improved and hole doping is increased .",
    "the variation of @xmath19 , with pressure therefore includes two terms  @xcite : @xmath98 the term on the left of the equation is the raw `` sensitivity to pressure '' , as measured in the experiment .",
    "the first term on the right represents the doping effect of pressure and the second term is the direct ( intrinsic ) dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath46 , of interest here .",
    "fortunately , the first term is small . in fig .",
    "s5 , we plot that raw @xmath99 vs doping @xmath18 ( open circles ) ( table s2 ) .",
    "we immediately see a sharp peak at @xmath11 .",
    "to investigate the effect of pressure - induced doping on these data , we plot a corrected set of data , obtained by subtracting the product of @xmath100 and @xmath91 . assuming that @xmath100 varies linearly with @xmath18 , we fix the prefactor by requiring that @xmath101 for @xmath102 , in the overdoped region .",
    "this is based on our assumption that the small negative values of @xmath68 measured at @xmath67 are purely due to the doping effect , since @xmath103 on the downward sloping side of the @xmath19 vs @xmath18 curve .",
    "this yields @xmath104 hole / gpa . as for @xmath91",
    ", it is simply the derivative of the @xmath19 vs @xmath18 curve ( black curve in fig .",
    "1 ) , plotted as the red line in fig .",
    "the corrected data are shown as full circles .",
    "we see that the correction is small everywhere .",
    "the bottom line is that whether we correct or not , the curve is strongly peaked at @xmath11 , and this peak starts below @xmath27 , exactly as the cdw dome ( fig .",
    "1 ) . moreover ,",
    "the sensitivity to pressure , whether raw or corrected , tracks the sensitivity to field at all @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    in fig .",
    "s8 , the value of @xmath19 measured in ybco by sadewasser _",
    "_  @xcite at 5 different dopings is plotted vs pressure .",
    "we extrapolate these curves to @xmath74 gpa , and hence obtain @xmath19 at @xmath74 gpa , plotted in fig .",
    "4 . in that figure",
    ", the doping values are obtained using the same formula as above , namely @xmath105 . in fig .",
    "s8 , the data at @xmath106 ( red ) need not be extrapolated since they go up to 17 gpa . the fact that @xmath19 for that sample becomes flat above 15 gpa implies that it has reached its maximal value , @xmath19 = 105 k. this shows that the peak in the dome of @xmath19 vs @xmath18 at 15 gpa must be at @xmath107 or lower . for the four other samples , extrapolations are needed to get @xmath19  at 15  gpa . for the highest doping ( black ; @xmath108 ) ,",
    "the linear extrapolation is reasonable and the uncertainty is small , so that @xmath19(15 gpa ) = @xmath109 k. for the lowest two dopings , it is clear that @xmath19(15 gpa ) = 0 regardless of how one extrapolates to 15 gpa .",
    "the only significant uncertainty is on the sample with @xmath110 ( blue ) , whose data stop at 8 gpa",
    ". the dependence of @xmath19 between 8 gpa and 15 gpa could be quite different from the linear extrapolation shown in fig .",
    "s8 . to reflect that uncertainty , we assign a large error bar to that point , namely @xmath19(15 gpa ) = @xmath111  k. note that this large uncertainty has little impact on the superconducting dome displayed in fig .",
    "4 . in particular",
    ", the position of the peak in the dome of @xmath19 vs @xmath18 at 15 gpa must necessarily be in the interval @xmath112 , most likely close to 0.13 ."

    "<S> two questions must be addressed : why a dome of cdw order peaked at @xmath0 ? </S>",
    "<S> why does pressure have such a strong detrimental effect on cdw order , while it has little direct effect on either superconductivity or the pseudogap phase ?    </S>",

    "<S> a crucial piece of information that had been missing until recently to make sense of the apparent complexity is the existence of a dome of cdw order in ybco . </S>",
    "<S> here we showed that magnetic field @xmath21 and pressure @xmath46 shift @xmath19  in the same way as a function of doping , but in opposite directions , and conclude that @xmath21 and @xmath46 are two independent parameters with which to tune the competition between superconductivity and cdw order in ybco : @xmath21  suppresses the former and @xmath46 suppresses the latter . </S>",
