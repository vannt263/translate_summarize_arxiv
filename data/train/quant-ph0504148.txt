    "finding an efficient separability criterion for multipartite quantum systems and characterizing entanglement have been an important problem in the field of quantum information theory . since bell formulated the statistical irregularities that can be seen in the correlations between measurement outcomes from two distant , but entangled , systems @xcite , various criteria and related notions have been discovered in the context of non - local correlations in quantum systems @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that it is possible to devise a protocol to extract more work via entangled systems from a heat bath thermodynamically than can be done from any separable state @xcite .",
    "this is of interest because a physically useful quantity , locally extractable work , can be employed to test the existence of entanglement in bipartite quantum systems , leading to the idea of thermodynamical separability criteria .    in this paper , we discuss if the thermodynamical separability criteria can be generalized to multipartite systems , particularly tripartite ones , as even the simplest transition from bi- to tripartite systems makes our problems much harder .",
    "it has been known that , unlike bipartite systems , there are two non - equivalent classes of entanglement , i.e. the ghz and the w states , when three quantum subsystems have non - local correlations @xcite .",
    "suppose that we are given an ensemble of tripartite systems , which is in either the separable or the ghz or the w states , where the ghz state @xcite can be in general written as @xmath0 and the w state @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two orthogonal states of a two - level system , e.g. eigenstates of a pauli spin operator @xmath4 .",
    "our task here is to distinguish each of these two ensembles from separable states in terms of extractable work . by extractable work ,",
    "we mean work that can be extracted thermodynamically from local heat baths under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "before discussing the case of tripartite entanglement , we here sketch the protocol shown in @xcite for the work - extraction from bipartite quantum systems .",
    "if we have an ensemble of two - level systems , either classical or quantum , we can extract work of amount of @xmath5 $ ] from a heat reservoir thermodynamically @xcite , where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the boltzmann constant , the temperature of the heat bath , and @xmath7 is the shannon entropy of a binary random variable @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath8 corresponds to the outcome of measurement on the system and @xmath7 can be written as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the probabilities for the two outcomes .",
    "we will set @xmath12 for simplicity hereafter and call the unit of work ",
    "bit `` . we will also write ' ' extracting work from quantum systems `` for short , instead of ' ' extracting work thermodynamically from a heat bath via quantum systems \" .",
    "the extractable work from correlated pairs in @xcite is a simple generalization of the above case .",
    "suppose that two distant parties , alice and bob , have an ensemble of identically prepared pairs of quantum bits ( _ qubits _ ) , which is described by a density operator @xmath13 .",
    "first , we define the extractable work @xmath14 when alice and bob chose @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the directions of their ( projective ) measurement . after dividing the shared ensemble into groups of two pairs , alice measures one of the two qubits in a group with the projector she chose and informs bob of the outcome ( see fig .",
    "[ protocol ] ) .",
    "bob performs the same on his qubit of the other pair in the group . as a result of collective manipulations",
    ", they can extract @xmath17 $ ] bits of work per pair at maximum .     and",
    "@xmath18 for their measurement and work extraction . for a half of this ensemble ,",
    "alice measures her state with @xmath19 and bob maximizes the extractable work from his side along the direction of @xmath16 by using alice s measurement results . for the other half , they exchange their roles . ]",
    "second , we consider a quantity @xmath20 , which is an average work extractable when we set @xmath21 and vary @xmath15 continuously over a great circle on the bloch sphere : @xmath22 the great circle is the one that maximizes the integral . the integral in eq .",
    "( [ var_basis ] ) can be taken over the whole bloch sphere , nevertheless , it does not change the essential part of our discussion here .    in @xcite , it was shown that an inequality @xmath23 is a necessary condition for a two - dimensional bipartite state @xmath13 to be separable , that is of the form , @xmath24 .",
    "the state @xmath25 in the right - hand side ( rhs ) can be any pure product state @xmath26 .",
    "if we integrate @xmath27 over the whole surface of the bloch sphere , then the condition ( [ theineq ] ) becomes @xmath28 where the subscript @xmath29 stands for the bloch sphere .",
    "this condition , eq . ( [ theineqbs ] ) , has been shown to be more effective than the standard bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( bell - chsh ) inequalities @xcite in detecting the inseparability of the werner state @xcite , which is a state in the form of @xmath30 .",
    "let us now consider the case of tripartite quantum systems . by generalizing the protocol in the previous section in a simple manner , we can have a necessary condition for separability , which is of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ theineq ] ) , straightforwardly .",
    "that is , each one of three parties receives the outcomes of measurements from the other two and we take conditional entropies such as @xmath31 instead of @xmath32 in the definition of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , the inequality ( [ theineq ] ) with @xmath35 on the left - hand side ( and a different numerical value ) holds for all separable states of the form of @xmath36 .",
    "the proof is essentially the same as that in @xcite .",
    "thus any violation of the inequality implies the existence of entanglement between at least two subsystems .",
    "obviously , this extension can be applied to correlations between larger number of subsystems .",
    "however , such an inequality tells little about the properties of multipartite entanglement .",
    "thus , we would like to find a different protocol and focus on distinguishing the two inequivalent classes of tripartite entanglement : in this paper , we will devise a way to distinguish the ghz state , the w state , and separable states , in terms of the extractable work .    with three parties ( alice , bob , and charlie ) , we consider a protocol in which one extracts work along the direction of the @xmath37-axis after receiving information on the outcomes of the other two s measurements along the @xmath38- and @xmath37- axes , respectively .",
    "namely , for a subensemble where alice and bob measure their qubits and charlie extracts work from his , the ( average ) amount of work obtainable is @xmath39 in this equation , we denote the direction of axis by a unit vector , such as @xmath40 .",
    "we have chosen two directions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for two measurements in anticipation that the difference between the ghz and the w states will be seen by varying the direction of @xmath41 , while keeping @xmath40 fixed .",
    "we do not lose generality by choosing the direction of the work - extraction to be the same as one of the measurement axes , that is @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ tri_work01 ] ) , as it is the right choice in detecting singlet - type bipartite entanglement .",
    "also , as we focus on the ghz and the w states , which are symmetric in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we will assume throughout the paper that it is charlie who extracts work after alice and bob make measurements on their subsystems .",
    "otherwise , we need to permute the roles of each party and take an average .     and @xmath41 , respectively , where bob varies the direction of @xmath41 , choosing one of the three orthogonal directions @xmath44 at each round .",
    "charlie extracts work along @xmath41 after receiving measurement results from alice and bob .",
    "they exchange their roles cyclically after three rounds , however , we do not consider the exchange of roles as the states of our interest here are symmetric with respect to three parties . ]",
    "we now show that a quantity below , @xmath45 , achieves our task .",
    "we assume that the direction @xmath40 is given and fixed for everyone of three parties throughout our discussion . instead of varying @xmath41 continuously",
    ", we average the extractable work over three orthogonal directions in the bloch sphere , @xmath46 , for @xmath41 .",
    "this is mainly because of our limited resource for numerical computation , but it does not change our main task at all . with only the direction of @xmath40 fixed , those of @xmath47 and @xmath48 can not be determined .",
    "we use @xmath49 to specify the angle between @xmath47 and a certain predetermined direction in the space . then , the averaged work can be written as @xmath50 and we take the maximum value of @xmath51 over @xmath49 to remove the @xmath49-dependence as @xmath52 we will analyse how we can use @xmath45 to distinguish three classes of correlations in tripartite systems .      with a product state , @xmath53",
    ", the extractable work depends only on the subsystem from which we extract work , regardless of the measurements on the other two .",
    "thus , @xmath54 will be determined solely by the geometric relation between the state of the system and the choice of axes .",
    "@xmath55 takes its maximum value of @xmath56 when the bloch vector representing the state coincides with one of the axes , i.e. @xmath57 for a given @xmath40 .",
    "we now show that @xmath56 is indeed an upper bound for the extractable work @xmath58 from any separable state .",
    "an inequality , @xmath59 is a necessary condition for a tripartite state @xmath13 to be separable .",
    "this condition is very similar to the thermodynamical separability criterion for bipartite correlations @xcite , however , @xmath45 is an average of work over only three directions as in eq .",
    "( [ tri_work02 ] ) , while it was over a great circle on the bloch sphere ( or the whole surface of the sphere ) in @xcite .",
    "this results in a difference in the efficiency of detecting weakly entangled states : the condition ( [ tri_criterion ] ) is less efficient than the criterion in @xcite , in this sense .",
    "_ the conditional entropy in eq .",
    "( [ tri_work01 ] ) can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 means that alice ( bob ) obtained the outcome @xmath62 by the measurement along @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the probability of a joint event of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . omitting the directions of axes for simplicity ,",
    "we can write eq . ( [ tri_proof01 ] ) as @xmath67 if the state @xmath13 is separable , i.e. @xmath68 , then the density operator for charlie after alice and bob obtained @xmath69 and @xmath70 becomes @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a projection operator for outcome @xmath73 along the direction of @xmath63 and @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 because of the concavity of the shannon entropy .",
    "if we were sure that we had a tripartite product state , @xmath76 , the conditional entropy would be @xmath77 where @xmath78 .    since @xmath79\\le 1/3 $ ] for all separable states @xmath80 , combining eqs .",
    "( [ tri_proof04 ] ) and ( [ tri_proof05 ] ) , we have @xmath81 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\le & \\max\\left[1-\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_n \\sum_{\\vec{u } } p_n h(c^n|a^n , b^n)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\le & \\frac{1}{3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus eq .",
    "( [ tri_criterion ] ) .",
    "as @xmath45 still has a dependence on the direction of @xmath40 , even a highly entangled state may not violate the inequality ( [ tri_criterion ] ) , however , once it is violated it is surely a manifestation of entanglement .",
    "let us discuss how we can distinguish the ghz , and the w states , using the above criterion . to this end",
    ", we make use of the remaining variable , i.e. the direction of @xmath40 .    the extractable work from a ghz state can reach 1 bit , which is the maximum possible violation of the inequality ( [ tri_criterion ] ) .",
    "this maximum is attained when we choose @xmath40 to be perpendicular to @xmath2 in the bloch sphere ( such as @xmath82 ) , the state after alice s measurement still has maximum ( bipartite ) entanglement . because of the perfect correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath43 , charlie can extract maximum work , 1 bit per one set of three subsystems .",
    "we have obtained the value of the minimum extractable work from the ghz as 0.1619 bits numerically .",
    "this occurs when @xmath84 and @xmath85 , for example , where @xmath15 and @xmath49 are the azimuthal and the longitudinal angles in the bloch sphere for the direction of alice s measurement basis @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the direction denoted by @xmath86 is that of @xmath2 and @xmath49 is a relative phase between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in their superpositions .",
    "the maximum work extractable from @xmath87 is @xmath88 , which is attained when the @xmath40-direction is parallel to @xmath2 .",
    "if the outcome of alice s measurement is 0 , which occurs with probability @xmath89 , the other two systems , @xmath83 and @xmath43 , will still have a perfect correlation along the three orthogonal directions , being in the state @xmath90 and thus charlie can get 1 bit of work . if alice s outcome is 1 , then charlie can obtain only @xmath56 bits on average as the remaining two systems are in a product state @xmath91 . therefore , the average extractable work will be @xmath92 bits .",
    "the minimum work from the w state was obtained numerically as 0.1696 bits .",
    "this is achieved when @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the direction of @xmath40 .",
    "now we can distinguish the ghz and the w states , looking at the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath58 after varying the direction of @xmath40 .",
    "the maximum and minimum extractable work from the ghz and the w states have the following relationships : @xmath95 although the difference between the two minima is rather small .",
    "therefore , when the state of a given ensemble is one of the three possibilities , the ghz , the w , and separable states , as we have assumed above , it is possible to specify the state by examining the range of extractable work . if @xmath96 always holds regardless of the direction of @xmath40 , then it is in a separable state due to the above proposition .",
    "suppose that entanglement exists only in two subsystems out of three , such as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a maximally entangled state .",
    "if we wish to discriminate such bipartite entanglement in tripartite systems , we need to examine the extractable work from each party , instead of simply computing the average @xmath58 . in this example of state @xmath99 , alice and bob",
    "can obtain the maximum work ( 1 bit ) , regardless of the outcome of charlie s measurement , because of the perfect correlation between @xmath100 and @xmath83 .",
    "however , no information from alice and bob can be useful to maximize the work charlie can extract .",
    "thus , he can have only @xmath56 bits of work at maximum after averaging over three directions .",
    "if one of the subsystems is disentangled from the other two , the extractable work from this site can not exceed @xmath56 , which is precisely what has been proved in the preceding subsection . by comparing the extractable work from each site",
    ", we can distinguish tripartite correlation with bipartite entanglement .    as we have mentioned above , the thermodynamical separability criterion for bipartite systems is able to detect more inseparability of the werner state of two qubits than the bell - chsh inequalities .",
    "let us consider a werner - type state , in analogy of the bipartite werner state , with tripartite systems @xcite : we define the ghz - werner - type state as @xmath101 and the w - werner - type state as @xmath102 these states are also referred to as isotropic states @xcite .",
    "the inequality ( [ tri_criterion ] ) turns out to be violated when @xmath103 with the ghz - werner - type state , and when @xmath104 with the w - werner - type state .",
    "are these criteria better than other schemes of multipartite - entanglement - detection ? in @xcite , the ghz - werner - type state with @xmath105 has been shown to be distillable , thus entangled , where @xmath106 with @xmath107 in @xcite , while we have no corresponding data for the w - werner - type state .",
    "let us take mermin s inequality as the multipartite version of bell - chsh inequalities @xcite .",
    "mermin s inequality for a tripartite system can be written as @xmath108 where the operator @xmath109 is defined as ( by omitting the @xmath110 sign ) @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ mermin_ineq02 ] ) , @xmath112 is a measurement operator at site @xmath113 and @xmath114 is a unit vector representing the direction of the measurement .    the ghz state , eq .",
    "( [ ghz ] ) , can violate the inequality ( [ mermin_ineq01 ] ) maximally as @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the ghz - werner - type state , eq .",
    "( [ ghz_werner ] ) , can violate eq .",
    "( [ mermin_ineq01 ] ) when @xmath116 since @xmath117 similarly , the w - werner - type state , eq .",
    "( [ w_werner ] ) , can violate the inequality when @xmath118 as the maximum value of @xmath119 is 3.046 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the condition ( [ tri_criterion ] ) is less effective in detecting the entanglement in both the ghz - werner - type and the w - werner - type states : there are a class of weakly entangled states that violate mermin s inequality , but do not violate eq .",
    "( [ tri_criterion ] ) .",
    ".the comparison of the thermodynamical separability criterion for tripartite systems , eq .",
    "( [ tri_criterion ] ) , and mermin s inequality , eq .",
    "( [ mermin_ineq01 ] ) , in detecting the inseparability of the werner - type states .",
    "this table shows the minimum values of @xmath120 to violate the inequalities , i.e. the smaller value , the more detection of inseparability . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the situation does not change much even if we average the extractable work by varying the @xmath41 over the whole bloch sphere . the inequality ( [ tri_criterion ]",
    ") can be violated by the ghz - werner - type state when @xmath121 and by the w - werner - type state when @xmath122 , after choosing @xmath40 optimally .",
    "the reason why eq .",
    "( [ tri_criterion ] ) is not as effective as mermin s inequality is yet unclear , while a similar thermodynamical criterion is more effective in the case of bipartite entanglement as shown in @xcite .",
    "we have generalized the thermodynamical separability criterion to tripartite quantum systems and shown that it can be used to distinguish two different classes of tripartite entanglement , the ghz and the w , in terms of thermodynamically extractable work under locc .",
    "we have also found that the criterion for tripartite systems is less effective in detecting the werner - type entanglement than that for bipartite systems .",
    "although it is not perfectly clear if the werner - type states above are the proper counterpart of the bipartite werner state we should compare with , it appears that the separability criterion we have obtained here is not as efficient as other criteria , such as mermin s inequality , in detecting weak entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , it is capable of distinguishing the ghz , the w , and separable states with physical quantity and this may lead to an interesting physical or information processing process , in which the w state is more useful than the ghz state , unlike most of the known processes .",
