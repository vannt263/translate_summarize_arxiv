    "spatial solitons are the localized bound states that can preserve their shapes during propagation in a nonlinear media .",
    "they exist by virtue of the balance between diffraction and nonlinearity .",
    "recently , the propagation of such optical beam in complex nonlinear media , featuring the parity - time ( pt)-symmetry , has been a subject of intense investigation @xcite .",
    "the pt - symmetry originates from quantum mechanics : a wide class of complex hamiltonians , although non - hermitian , can still exhibit real and discrete energy eigenvalues provided that they respect the combined symmetry of parity ( @xmath0 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath1 ) operators @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath0 , responsible for spatial reflection , is defined through the operations @xmath2 , while the operator @xmath1 leads to @xmath3 and to complex conjugation @xmath4 . a necessary condition for a hamiltonian to be",
    "pt - symmetric is that the potential function @xmath5 should satisfy the condition @xmath6 , with @xmath7 denoting the complex conjugation .",
    "the connection , bridged by the schrdinger equation , between the quantum mechanics and the optical field made it possible to realize the idea of pt - symmetry in optical structures . in optics , the complex refractive index plays the role of a pt - symmetric potential such that @xmath8 , the index guiding , is an even function of position and @xmath9 , the gain - loss profile , is an odd function .",
    "thus , optical structures having pt - symmetry can realistically be implemented through a judicious inclusion of balanced gain and loss in optical waveguides .",
    "a series of recent experiments on such optical structures lead to altogether new dynamics such as abrupt phase transition , power oscillation , double refraction , and appearance of stable optical soliton etc @xcite .",
    "optical soliton supported by a pt - symmetric complex potential may exhibit two parametric regions : a region where such soliton propagates stably whereas the other region corresponds to the unstable propagation .",
    "a threshold , therefore , exists between these two regions ; below this threshold value .",
    "the solitons are stable , whereas they are unstable above the threshold .",
    "the existence of various types of stable solitons in diverse complex potentials with gain and loss has been reported .",
    "these works include , for example , solitons in nonlinear lattices @xcite , dark soliton and vortices @xcite , gray soliton @xcite , stable bright soliton in defocusing kerr media @xcite and stable light bullet solutions @xcite . exact closed form nonlinear localized modes in pt - symmetric optical media with competing gain - loss @xcite and with competing nonlinearity @xcite are reported .",
    "the role of pt - symmetry has been investigated in nonlinear tunneling @xcite and on soliton propagation in nonlinear couplers @xcite .",
    "two dimensional solitons in pt - symmetric periodic @xcite , nonlocal @xcite and inhomogeneous @xcite nonlinear media are also studied . in most of these works ,",
    "the localized solutions are obtained with the help of some numerical techniques .",
    "in fact , there are very few models which possess exact analytical expressions for the localized modes @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here about some recent analytical approaches for obtaining exact solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , e.g. , similarity transformation method @xcite , the hirota method @xcite and painleve - integrability analysis @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a parity - time - symmetric complex potential [ given in equation ( [ e3 ] ) ] , which admits analytical localized solution in the presence of power - law nonlinearities including the kerr one .",
    "the exact expressions of such solution , which are gaussian in nature , are obtained in both @xmath10 and @xmath11 dimensional nlse .",
    "a linear stability analysis corroborated by the direct numerical simulations reveals that these analytical localized modes can propagate stably for a wide range of the potential parameters and for higher order nonlinearities .",
    "nature of the total power and the transverse power - flow density associated with these solutions are also discussed .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we have briefly described the mathematical model of the optical beam propagation and obtained the corresponding exact solutions in one - dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "the linear stability of these solutions is discussed in section iia .",
    "section iii deals with the analytical localized modes and their linear stability in two - dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "we consider beam propagation along the @xmath12 direction in a nonlinear medium of non - kerr index with a complex transverse refractive index profile .",
    "evolution of the dimensionless light field envelope @xmath13 in a single pt cell is governed by the @xmath10 dimensional nlse @xcite : @xmath14 \\psi + \\sigma |\\psi|^{2 m } \\psi = 0 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where the transverse @xmath15 and longitudinal @xmath12 coordinates are scaled in the terms of diffraction length and beam width , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 corresponds to the self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath17 is a positive integer which determines the order of the nonlinearity . for",
    "@xmath18 one has the kerr nonlinearity , for @xmath19 the quintic , for @xmath20 the septic , etc . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the real and imaginary parts of the pt - symmetric complex potential which satisfy @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this paper , we choose @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as @xmath23 where the potential parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are real .",
    "first three parameters determine the depth of the potential , and the last one is responsible for various width .",
    "note here that in the practical application of an optical beam propagation , it is desirable to consider a periodic potential .",
    "however , we shall show in the following that a single pt cell characterized by the above potential is capable to produce stable solitonic solutions by suppressing the collapse caused by the diffraction .",
    "the stationary solution of the nlse ( [ e1 ] ) can be determined by assuming @xmath27 , where the complex valued function @xmath28 describes , in general , the soliton and @xmath29 is a real propagation constant .",
    "substitution of this expression of @xmath13 into the eq .",

    "the real and imaginary parts of this localized solution are shown in figure [ fig1](b ) for @xmath35 and @xmath36 . before doing the linear stability analysis of the solution ( [ e32 ] )",
    ", we look into the following two quantities .",
    "the total power of the stationary localized solution is @xmath37 .",
    "hence , @xmath38 is always real and positive for both the self - focusing and self - defocusing cases if @xmath39 . on the other hand",
    "the transverse power or the energy flow - density is given by @xmath40 = \\frac{m w_0 \\phi_0^{2}}{2 a^2 ( m+2 ) } e^{-\\frac{m+2}{m } a^2 x^2}$ ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath41 is everywhere positive if @xmath42 .",
    "the positive value of @xmath43 implies that the energy flow is one - way ( from gain toward loss ) .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze the linear stability of the exact localized solutions obtained in previous section .",
