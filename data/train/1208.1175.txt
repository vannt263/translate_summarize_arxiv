    "the shrinking size of spintronics devices and the need for efficient and scalable methods for their manipulation has led to enhanced interest in spin - torque effects of electrical current on the magnetic configuration of nanostructures .",
    "the study in this direction has focused so far on effects related to magnetic nonuniformity ; in particular , the effect of current on ferromagnetic domain walls which yields domain wall motion @xcite and the effect of current on magnetic heterostructures which yields magnetic switching @xcite .",
    "both effects have been observed in different systems and they appear to be useful for novel memory devices .",
    "a more subtle effect of magnetic nonuniformity is expected when a single uniformly magnetized nanostructure is connected via asymmetric contacts to normal metals . in this case ,",
    "asymmetric spin accumulation near the two contacts may induce magnetic instability @xcite .    based on several theoretical works ,",
    "electrical current is expected to induce magnetization reversal also in a uniformly magnetized ferromagnet irrespective of the contact geometry @xcite due to a current - induced spin wave instability .",
    "this is a fundamental phenomenon with practical implications on the functionality of spintronic devices ; hence , its experimental study is of particular importance for the field of spintronics .",
    "nevertheless , so far the study of this phenomenon has been very sparse @xcite .",
    "current - induced magnetization reversal in uniformly magnetized films is expected at relatively high current densities .",
    "such currents generate heat and high oersted - fields which may also induce magnetization reversal .",
    "therefore , reliable identification of the phenomenon requires the ability to isolate the effect of the current itself .",
    "here we use the itinerant ferromagnet srruo@xmath0 @xcite , a material characterized by large spin polarization of its conducting electrons @xcite .",
    "this material exhibits large domain wall resistivity @xcite and efficient current - induced domain wall motion @xcite indicating strong effect of the current on the magnetic configuration and vice versa .    in this work ,",
    "we observe magnetization reversal induced by current above a temperature dependent threshold and show that this effect is not simply due to sample heating or oersted fields .",
    "our observations are obtained for a wide range of temperatures while applying various fields including a zero field and fields suppressing reversal .",
    "basic features of the results are consistent with the spin wave instability scenario @xcite suggesting that this is the relevant mechanism .",

    "the sharp jumps are attributed to magnetization reversal . ]",
    "our samples are high - quality epitaxial films of srruo@xmath0 which were grown on slightly miscut ( 2@xmath1 ) srtio@xmath0 substrates .",
    "the films are orthorhombic ( @xmath2  , @xmath3  , @xmath4  ) with the @xmath5 axis in the film plane ( perpendicular to the miscut direction ) and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes are at 45@xmath1 relative to the film plane .",
    "the curie temperature of the films is @xmath8 k and they exhibit uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy with the easy axis changing in the ( 001 ) plane between the @xmath7 axis at @xmath9@xmath10 to @xmath11 from the film normal at low temperatures @xcite . the ratio between the resistivity at 300 k and the resistivity at the low temperature limit is greater than ten .",
    "the films are patterned for magnetotransport measurements using e - beam lithography and @xmath12 ion milling with a typical current path width of 1.5 @xmath13 m .",
    "the data presented below are for film thickness of 37.5 nm .",
    "the magnetization of the patterns is monitored by measuring the hall effect ( he ) which consists ( as in other magnetic conductors ) of an ordinary hall effect ( ohe ) determined by the perpendicular component of the magnetic field and an anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) related to the perpendicular component of the magnetization . since the easy axis for magnetization in srruo@xmath14",
    "is tilted out of the plane there is a contribution of the ahe in the absence of an external field @xcite .",
    "as we study the contribution of current to magnetization reversal with and without an applied magnetic field , we first determine the temperature dependence of the reversal field , @xmath15 , in the absence of current effects @xcite . in these measurements",
    "we monitor the magnetization with a small current of 30 @xmath13a ( current density @xmath16 ) which is too small to contribute to the magnetization reversal ( see figure  [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we fully magnetize the sample at a low temperature and then apply a certain reversing field and warm the sample at a rate of 20 k / min until reversal occurs ( see inset of figure  [ 1 ] ) . in this experiment and in the experiments described below the magnetic field",
    "is applied perpendicular to the film plane . to explore current contribution to magnetization reversal , we fully magnetize the sample at an initial temperature , @xmath17 , between 28 and 145 k and apply a current pulse of constant duration . the amplitude of the pulse is gradually increased and the magnetization is monitored after each pulse by measuring the ahe with a probing current of 30 @xmath13a .",
    "we repeat these experiments with various magnetic fields , both assisting and suppressing magnetization reversal .    as we show below",
    ", our main observation is that when the amplitude of the pulse exceeds a certain value the pattern is no longer fully magnetized .    ) vs. pulse duration .",
    "the pulse amplitude varies between 2.57 and 5.8 ma , and the initial temperature varies between 100 and 30 k , respectively .",

    "the total pulse duration is 1 ms . ]",
    "the currents that induce magnetic instability correspond to high current densities ( 1 ma corresponds to current density of @xmath19 ) ; therefore , the effect of heating should be carefully considered . to identify changes in the temperature of the pattern during the pulse , we use the measured temperature dependence of the resistance of the pattern as our calibrated temperature sensor ; see the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistance , @xmath18 , measured between two neighboring voltage leads ( figure  [ 2](a ) ) .    figure  [ 2](b ) shows changes in @xmath18 during current pulses with various amplitudes .",
    "the duration of the pulse is 2 ms and @xmath18 is measured in 50 @xmath13s intervals .",
    "the temperature of the pattern before the current pulse is applied , @xmath17 , is between 30 k and 100 k and the current amplitude is between 2.57 ma ( for @xmath17=100 k ) to 5.8 ma ( for @xmath17=30 k ) .",
    "we note a fast initial increase in the resistance followed by saturation .",
    "in the current - induced magnetization reversal measurement shown below we use 1 ms pulses with amplitudes which do not exceed 5.84 ma , and we measure @xmath18 during the last 50 @xmath13s of the pulse . in these conditions ,",
    "the measurement reflects well the highest value of @xmath18 during the pulse .",

    "based on the temperature dependence of @xmath18 ( figure  [ 2](a ) ) we can determine the effective temperature , @xmath20 , at the end of the current pulse .",
    "as this is practically a steady state , we expect that the power dissipation in the pattern , given by @xmath21 , would be balanced by the heat flow .",

    "figure  [ 3](a ) shows a typical measurement of current induced magnetization reversal performed at @xmath17=70 k with a reversing field of @xmath24=100 oe . the amplitude of the current pulse is gradually increased and the figure shows the effective temperature @xmath20 during the pulse and the normalized average magnetization , @xmath28 , as determined after the pulse at the pre - pulse temperature by measuring the ahe with a small probing current and dividing the obtained signal by the signal corresponding to full magnetization ( the sample cools down to its pre - pulse temperature in less than 1 second ) .",
    "based on such measurements we determine the current , @xmath29 , temperature , @xmath27 , and magnetic field , @xmath15 , at which magnetization reversal occurs .",
    "the results are insensitive to current polarity .",
    "figure  [ 3](b ) presents @xmath27 ( the magnetization reversal temperature ) as a function of the current pulse amplitude when no magnetic field is applied and when a reversing field of 2000 oe is applied perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "the horizontal lines mark @xmath27 for the two fields in the limit of zero current as determined in temperature sweep experiments ( see figure  [ 1 ] ) . to produce the curves we cool the sample to different temperatures and gradually increase the current pulse .",
    "the points represent the current amplitude for which first magnetization reversal occurred and the highest temperature of the sample during the pulse . for @xmath24=2000",
    "oe , @xmath27 is practically independent of @xmath29 for a wide range of current amplitudes , suggesting no current effect beyond the joule heating which we monitor . on the other hand , for @xmath24=0",
    ", @xmath27 significantly decreases with increasing current , indicating non - trivial current effects .",
    "in addition to heating , current may affect the magnetization reversal due to the oersted field it induces @xcite . based on calculations",
    ", we find that the highest field ( at the edges of the current path ) induced by the largest current we use , 5.8 ma , is @xmath30 40 oe normal to the film plane , small compared to @xmath15 at the relevant temperatures .",
    "based on measurements as shown in figure  [ 3](a ) , we construct figure  [ 4 ] which shows for the vicinity of a given @xmath20 ( within @xmath31 k ) the combinations of currents and fields that produce first reversal or no - reversal .",
    "such plots allow us to explore the nonthermal effect of the current as its heating effect is already taken into consideration .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath15 in the limit of zero current for the upper bound of @xmath20 .",
    "the solid line marks the threshold current , @xmath32 , above which the current affects the magnetization reversal in a non - trivial way .",
    "we define this current as the current for which @xmath15 is smaller than its zero limit value by 1.5 times the standard deviation of its distribution for lower currents .",
    "the fact that the plot shows multiple values of @xmath15 for a given @xmath33 has several reasons : the spread in @xmath20 , which is related to the finite increments of the current pulse , the stochastic nature of the effect , and weak field dependence of @xmath29 . at @xmath34 k ( figure  [ 4](a ) )",
    "we identify a sharp transition from a current independent regime to a field independent regime .",
    "while for currents lower than @xmath32 the field is current independent , for currents higher than @xmath32 the field dependence is very weak and almost the same current induces magnetization reversal for a wide range of fields including fields which oppose reversal . as @xmath20 increases , the transition becomes more gradual .",
    "( @xmath353 k ) between 102 and 120 k. the dashed lines represent @xmath15 in the limit of zero current at the upper bound of the temperature regime , and the solid lines represent the threshold currents , @xmath32 . ]    , ( red dots ) and the threshold current , @xmath32 , ( blue squares ) as a function of temperature . ]",
    "figure  [ 5 ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath32 and of @xmath36 defined as the current at which @xmath15 becomes zero ; namely , the current which produces magnetization reversal without external field assistance .",
    "@xmath32 is extracted from figure  [ 4 ] ; therefore , @xmath20 has an error bar of @xmath31 k. on the other hand , for @xmath36 the error bar is related to the temperature increment produced by the current increment in our experiments .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite suggests a threshold current inversely proportional to the ahe coefficient . in srruo@xmath14",
    "the ahe vanishes at @xmath37 k ; however , we see no divergence of the reversing currents in the vicinity of that temperature .",
    "the existence of a threshold current appears to be consistent with the spin wave scenarios @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the threshold current density , @xmath38 , in the zero - temperature limit is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the gyromagnetic ratio , electron charge and bohr magneton respectively , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the domain wall width and the polarization of the current , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the saturation magnetization , the anisotropy field and the external field , respectively . since the relevant external fields which we apply are negligible relative to the large anisotropy field of srruo@xmath0 ( @xmath46 t ) @xcite , we expect a weak field dependence of @xmath47 , as observed . substituting the parameters of srruo@xmath14 yields at zero temperature current density @xmath48 and a critical wave length of the spin wave excitation of about @xmath304.2 nm , while our measurements at @xmath20 = 102 k yield @xmath49 .",
    "at least some of the discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that the model is developed at zero temperature while our measurements are at @xmath50 .",
    "we note that for co the expected @xmath47 is more than one order of magnitude higher @xcite with a critical wave length of about @xmath3030 nm @xcite .",
    "this comparison highlights the intrinsic advantage of srruo@xmath14 in studying current induced magnetization reversal .    in conclusion , we present strong experimental evidence for a non - trivial current contribution to magnetization reversal and we identify features consistent with magnetic instability induced by spin - wave excitations .",
