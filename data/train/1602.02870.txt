    "the random slow dynamics of fluid membranes visible as a flickering phenomenon in giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) or red blood cells ( rbcs ) has attracted many interests in the last few decades  @xcite .",
    "these thermally excited shape fluctuations can be essentially understood as a brownian motion of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lipid bilayer membrane in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) viscous fluid such as water . for spherically closed artificial guvs ,",
    "characteristic relaxation times for shape deformations were calculated analytically  @xcite .",
    "analysis of shape fluctuations can be used for quantitative measurements of surface tension and/or bending rigidity of single - component guvs  @xcite or guvs containing bacteriorhodopsin pumps  @xcite .",
    "historically , investigations on fluctuations of cell membranes have started with rbcs whose flickering can be observed under a microscope  @xcite .",
    "brochard and lennon were among the first to describe quantitatively membrane fluctuations as thermally excited undulations , mainly governed by the bending rigidity of the membrane  @xcite .",
    "later experiments showed that flickering in rbcs is not purely of thermal origin but rather corresponds to a non - equilibrium situation because the fluctuation amplitude decreases upon atp depletion  @xcite . here",
    "atp hydrolysis plays an important role to control membrane - spectrin cytoskeleton interactions  @xcite .",
    "more advanced techniques have demonstrated that , at longer time scales ( small frequencies ) , a clear difference exists between the power spectral density of rbc membranes measured for normal cells and those atp depleted ; the fluctuation amplitude turns out to be higher in the former  @xcite . at shorter time scales , on the other hand , membranes fluctuate as in the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the role of atp in flickering is still debatable because boss _",
    "have recently claimed that the mean fluctuation amplitudes of rbc membranes can be described by the thermal equilibrium theory , while atp merely affects the bending rigidity  @xcite .    in order to understand shape fluctuations of rbcs",
    ", one needs to properly take into account the effects of spectrin cytoskeleton network that is connected to the membrane by actin , glycophorin , and protein 4.1r  @xcite .",
    "_ treated the cytoskeleton as a rigid wall ( shell ) located at a fixed distance from the membrane , and assumed that its static and dynamic fluctuations are confined by the cytoskeleton  @xcite .",
    "they further considered that the sparse connection of membrane and cytoskeleton gives rise to a finite surface tension for length scales larger than the membrane persistence length .",
    "the bending free energy for a membrane was extended to include a surface tension and a confinement potential with which the effects of atp on the membrane fluctuations was described . however , since an active component of the membrane fluctuations also depend on the fluid viscosity  @xcite , they can not be solely attributed to the static parameters such as the surface tension or the potential .",
    "gov and safran later estimated the active contribution to the membrane fluctuations due to the release of stored tension in the spectrin filament and membrane in each dissociation event  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to static thermal fluctuations , they showed that the active cytoskeleton may contribute to the membrane fluctuations at intermediate length scales .",
    "effects of membrane confinement are important not only for shape fluctuations of rbcs but also for a hydrodynamic coupling between closely apposed lipid bilayer membranes  @xcite , and dynamical transitions occurring in lamellar membranes under shear flow  @xcite .",
    "after the seminal works by kramer  @xcite and by brochard and lennon  @xcite , the wavenumber - dependent decay rate for the bending modes of a membrane bound to a wall was calculated by seifert  @xcite and gov _ et al . _",
    "in particular , seifert showed that the scale separation between the membrane - wall distance and the correlation length determined by the confinement potential can lead to various crossover behaviors of the decay rate . in these hydrodynamic calculations ,",
    "however , the wall that interacts with the membrane was treated as a static object and does not play any active role .",
    "quite generally , active motions of a membrane can be induced by non - thermal fluctuations that occur in the outer environment of the membrane such as cytoskeleton or cytoplasm . in this paper , we consider the dynamics of a membrane interacting with an active wall that generates random velocities in the ambient fluid .",
    "these random velocities at the wall can be naturally taken into account through the boundary conditions of the fluid .",
    "we first derive a dynamic equation for the membrane fluctuation amplitude in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "then we calculate the membrane two - point correlation functions for three different cases ; ( i ) a static wall , ( ii ) an active wall , and ( iii ) an active wall with an intrinsic time scale .",
    "we especially focus on the mean squared displacement ( msd ) of a tagged membrane segment , and discuss its asymptotic time dependencies for the above cases . for the static wall case",
    ", the membrane fluctuates due to thermal agitations , and there are two asymptotic regimes of msd ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) if the hydrodynamic decay rate changes monotonically as a function of the wavenumber .",
    "when the wall is active , there is a region during which the msd grows linearly with time ( @xmath2 ) , which is unusual for a membrane segment .",
    "if the active wall has a finite intrinsic time scale , the above linear - growth regime of the msd is further extended . as a whole",
    ", active fluctuations at the wall propagate through the surrounding fluid and greatly affects the membrane fluctuations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the hydrodynamics of a bound membrane that interacts with an active wall .",
    "we also derive a dynamic equation for the membrane fluctuation amplitude in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : msd ] , we calculate the membrane two - point correlation functions for three different cases of the wall as mentioned above .",
