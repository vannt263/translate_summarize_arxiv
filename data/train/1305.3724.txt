    "the probabilistic aspects of quantum mechanics are inherent characteristics and are not due to lack of detailed information such as partition functions in statistical mechanics .",

    "thermodynamics is a field of physics that discusses the relationship between the macroscopic physical quantities such as temperature , pressure , volume , energy , entropy , and heat and/or work from outside of the system .",
    "thermodynamics was established before the microscopic details were clarified .",
    "later , statistical mechanics was constructed on the basis of the microscopic details of classical mechanics using thermodynamics as a guiding principle . however , statistical mechanics based on classical mechanics failed to explain , for instance , the entire nature of electromagnetic waves radiated from gases and metals , which provided a hint about quantum mechanics .",
    "although the microscopic details of statistical mechanics were replaced by quantum mechanics instead of by classical mechanics , the consequences of thermal dynamics remain true , and again thermal dynamics plays the role of a guiding principle in constructing a theory .",
    "thermodynamics and its second law are still active in the field of physics , and are discussed , for instance , by lieb and yngvason in their epoch - making paper@xcite .",
    "relationships between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are also intensively discussed by gemmer , michel and mehler@xcite .",
    "they gave new explanations for the emergence of thermodynamics behavior from a quantum mechanical system .",
    "our way is something opposite to their intention , `` the emergence of quantum mechanics from the thermodynamics '' .",
    "+ in our pursuit of the principle that underlies the probabilistic characteristics of the basic equations of motion , we suspend the notion that quantum mechanics is the most fundamental theory of nature and regard it as a phenomenological theory .",
    "in other words , we propose to construct the thermodynamics of quantum mechanics and then pursue the underlying mechanics , which must be a more fundamental theory of nature . in this study",
    ", we attempt to construct the thermodynamics of classical and quantum mechanics of a mass point .",
    "to construct the thermodynamics of classical mechanics , an appropriate definition of entropy must be introduced . to determine the entropy of the classical dynamical system of a mass point , we consider the system in geometrical terms and introduce a general dynamical system @xmath1 arnold , vogtmann and weistein@xcite .",
    "then , the analogy between the thermodynamics of gases and the hamiltonian formalism of classical dynamics guides us to identify an appropriate definition of entropy .",
    "an equation of motion of the system can be extracted by requiring the maximum - entropy principle ( instead of the principle of least action ) .",
    "finally , quantum fluctuations can be understood in analogy with thermal fluctuations .",

    "the probability amplitude was essential for transferring the system from a classical to quantum state . in summary , we incorporated various dynamical systems such as classical mechanics of a mass point and equilibrium thermodynamics and quantum mechanics of a point particle into a general mathematical framework .",
    "+ while this framework provides a unique vantage point for both classical and quantum mechanics , it is not yet suitable for quantum mechanical analysis .",
    "we defined quantum amplitudes on a curvilinear space of precisely fixed end points .",
    "a basic quantum mechanical element is not naturally located in such a space - time manifold because of violation of the uncertainty relation . to satisfy the uncertainty relation , the essential element of quantum mechanics",
