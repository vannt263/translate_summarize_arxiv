    "the theoretical determination of the spectrum of baryon resonances from qcd continues to be an important goal .",
    "lattice qcd calculations have succeeded in part to meet this goal by providing results for the lowest - mass baryon of each isospin in the quenched approximation using overly large masses for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "@xcite    most lattice simulations to date have used restricted sets of operators appropriate for @xmath3 states .",
    "masses of low - lying , positive - parity baryons are reproduced with approximately 10% deviations from experimental values using the quenched approximation  @xcite . much less",
    "is known about higher - spin excited states .",
    "the first preliminary lattice calculation of @xmath4 @xmath5 masses was reported by the lattice hadron physics collaboration  @xcite using one of the operators that we develop in this paper  @xcite .",
    "results for excited baryons were also reported based on the use of different radial smearings of the quarks in refs .",
    "recently , studies of negative - parity baryons have been reported by several groups  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ and melnitchouk _ et al .",
    "_ considered the @xmath6 baryon , which is the lightest negative - parity baryon despite its nonzero strangeness .",
    "they used a three - quark interpolating field operator motivated by the spin - flavor @xmath7 quark model and concluded that @xmath6 was not evident in their lattice calculations .    to improve upon our understanding of the resonance spectrum ,",
    "correlation matrices will be needed , necessitating the construction of sufficiently large sets of baryon and multi - hadron operators .",
    "the correlation - matrix method  @xcite has been used to determine the spectrum of glueball masses by morningstar and peardon  @xcite .",
    "a large number of interpolating field operators was used to form matrices of lattice correlation functions .",
    "the spectrum of effective masses was obtained by diagonalizing the matrices of correlation functions to isolate mass eigenstates for each symmetry channel . in effect , one allows the dynamics to determine the optimal linear combination of operators that couple to each mass state .",
    "a similar program for baryons is being undertaken by the lattice hadron physics collaboration .",
    "the first step is to determine a large number of suitable baryon interpolating field operators that correspond to states of zero momentum , definite parity and values of angular momentum @xmath8 .    due to the complexity of the operator construction and the importance of providing checks on the final results ,",
    "we have been pursuing two different approaches .",
    "an alternative method , based on a computational implementation of the group projection operation , is presented elsewhere  @xcite .    on a cubic lattice ,",
    "the continuum rotational symmetry is broken to the finite octahedral group , @xmath9 .",
    "states of definite angular momentum correspond to states that occur in certain patterns distributed over the irreducible representations ( irs ) of @xmath9 .",
    "although mass calculations are insensitive to the spin projection @xmath10 , other applications do require baryons with a definite spin projection .",
    "we develop operators that are irs of @xmath9 using a basis that corresponds as closely as possible to the continuum @xmath11 states in order to have operators for applications that require spin projection .",
    "it is important to use smearing of the quark fields and to have nonlocal baryon operators as well as the usual local operators .",
    "smeared and nonlocal operators provide a variety of radial and angular distributions of quarks within a baryon so as to couple efficiently to excited states .",
    "nonlocal operators are needed in order to realize spins @xmath12 and simply to enlarge the sets of operators .    in this paper",
    ", we first review some basic facts about the octahedral group for integer and half - integer spins in section  [ sec : grouptheory ]  @xcite and review a useful notation for dirac indices based on @xmath13-spin .",
    "two basic types of three - quark operators are considered : quasi - local and nonlocal .",
    "each quark field in a quasi - local baryon operator is smeared about a common point @xmath14 using the same cubically symmetric form of smearing .",
    "quasi - local operators include local operators as a special case , i.e. , when the smearing is omitted .",
    "we develop irs for quasi - local operators in section  [ sec : local ] for each baryon : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this amounts to determining all allowed combinations of dirac indices for each flavor symmetry and classifying them into irs of the octahedral group .",
    "the quasi - local operators provide templates that are used for the construction of nonlocal operators in section  [ sec : nonlocal ] .",
    "nonlocal operators are formed by applying extra lattice displacements to one ( or more ) of the smeared quark fields , thus providing a smearing distribution that differs from that used for the other quarks . in the simplest case ,",
    "the combination of extra displacements used is cubically symmetric and only changes the radial distribution of the smearing . in other cases the combinations of the extra displacements transform as irs of the octahedral group , and",
    "are chosen to correspond as closely as possible to spherical harmonics .",
    "the irs of lattice displacements and irs of dirac indices are combined to form overall irs for the nonlocal operators using an appropriate set of clebsch - gordan coefficients of the octahedral group .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in lattice qcd , hadron field operators are composed of quark and gluon fields on a spatially - isotropic cubic lattice .",
    "the lattice is symmetric with respect to a restricted set of rotations about spatial axes that form the octahedral group , @xmath9 , which is a subgroup of the continuum rotational group @xmath0 .",
    "the octahedral group consists of 24 group elements , each corresponding to a discrete rotation that leaves invariant a cube , or an octahedron embedded within the cube . when the objects that are rotated involve half - integer values of the angular momentum , the number of group elements doubles to extend the range of rotational angles from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , forming the double - valued representations of the octahedral group , referred to as @xmath23 .",
    "spatial inversion commutes with all rotations and together with the identity forms a two - element point group .",
    "taking inversion together with the finite rotational group simply doubles the number of group elements , giving the group @xmath24 for half - integer spins .    given a lattice interpolating operator for a baryon , one may generate other operators by applying the elements of @xmath24 to the given operator .",
    "this produces a set of operators that transform amongst themselves with respect to @xmath24 , and thus these operators @xmath25 form the basis of a representation of the group .",
    "when a group element @xmath26 is applied to operator @xmath25 in the set , the result is a linear combination of other operators in the set , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a matrix representation of the octahedral group .",
    "such matrix representations are in general reducible . in order to identify operators that correspond to baryons with specific lattice symmetries , it is necessary to block - diagonalize @xmath29 , each block corresponding to an irreducible representation of the octahedral group .",
    "this task is facilitated by a judicious choice of ir basis vectors for the octahedral group , such as the `` cubic harmonics '' or `` lattice harmonics '' of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the octahedral group @xmath9 has five irs , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 with dimension 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 3 , respectively , where we follow the conventions of ref .",
    "the patterns of irs of @xmath9 that correspond to irs of the continuum rotational group @xmath0 with spin @xmath32 are shown in table  [ table : subduction_o ] ."
