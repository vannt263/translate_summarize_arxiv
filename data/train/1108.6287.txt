    "<S> recently , sharkas , toulouse , and savin  @xcite have provided a rigorous reformulation of the double - hybrid approximations based on the adiabatic - connection formalism , leading to the _ density - scaled one - parameter double - hybrid _ ( ds1dh ) approximation @xmath13   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + e_c[n ] -{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}^2 e_c[n_{1/{\\ensuremath{\\lambda } } } ] + { \\ensuremath{\\lambda}}^2 e_c^{\\text{mp2 } } , \\label{excds1dh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 $ ] is the usual correlation energy functional evaluated at the scaled density @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> they have constructed the pbe0-dh double - hybrid approximation which performs reasonably well . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we give a rationale for this class of double - hybrid approximations . </S>",
    "<S> for this , we start by recalling that the density - scaled correlation functional @xmath2 $ ] tends to the second - order grling - levy ( gl2 )  @xcite correlation energy when the density is squeezed up to the high - density limit ( or weak - interaction limit ) @xmath22 = e_c^{\\text{gl2 } } , \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is finite for nondegenerate ks systems </S>",
    "<S> . the gl2 correlation energy can be decomposed as ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the usual mp2 correlation energy expression @xmath25 with the antisymmetrized two - electron integrals @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is an additional contribution involving the difference between the local multiplicative ks exchange potential @xmath28 and the nonlocal nonmultiplicative hf exchange potential @xmath29 @xmath30 in both eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ecmp2 ] ) and  ( [ ecdhf ] ) , @xmath31 are the ks orbitals and @xmath32 are their associated energies , and the indices @xmath33,@xmath34 and @xmath35,@xmath36 stand for occupied and virtual orbitals , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the single - excitation contribution @xmath27 vanishes for two - electron systems , and in most other cases is negligible  @xcite , so that the gl2 correlation energy is well approximated by just the mp2 contribution ( evaluated with ks orbitals ) , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to propose an approximation for @xmath2 $ ] based on a linear interpolation formula @xmath15 \\approx ( 1-{\\ensuremath{\\lambda } } ) e_c^{\\text{mp2 } } + { \\ensuremath{\\lambda}}e_c[n ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{ecscaledlinear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plugging eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ecscaledlinear ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ excds1dh ] ) , we directly arrive at what we call the _ linearly scaled one - parameter double - hybrid _ ( ls1dh ) approximation @xmath38   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( 1-{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}^3 ) e_c[n ] + { \\ensuremath{\\lambda}}^3 e_c^{\\text{mp2 } } , \\label{ls1dh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the weights @xmath19 and @xmath1 , thus giving a stronger rationale to the expression that brmond and adamo have proposed on the basis of different considerations . </S>",
    "<S> further insight into this approximation can be gained by rewriting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ecscaledlinear ] ) in the alternative form @xmath15 \\approx e_c^{\\text{mp2 } } + { \\ensuremath{\\lambda}}\\left ( e_c[n ] - e_c^{\\text{mp2 } } \\right ) , \\label{ecscaledexpand}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can then be interpreted as a first - order expansion in @xmath0 around @xmath3 with @xmath39 - e_c^{\\text{mp2}}$ ] approximating the third - order correlation energy correction @xmath40 $ ] in grling - levy perturbation theory . in comparison , </S>",

    "<S> \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this sense , the ls1dh approximation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ls1dh ] ) can be considered as a next - order approximation in @xmath0 beyond the usual hybrid approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : hebe ] illustrates the different approximations to the density - scaled correlation energy @xmath2 $ ] as a function of @xmath0 for the he and be atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the accurate reference curve is from the parametrization of ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath4 , it reduces to the exact correlation energy , while for @xmath3 it is the gl2 correlation energy which tends to overestimate the correlation energy . in between these two limits , it is nearly linear with @xmath0 . the pbe correlation energy without density scaling [ eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ecnoscaled ] ) ] is the crudest approximation to @xmath2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the pbe correlation energy with density scaling ( taken from the parametrization of ref .  ) gives a nearly linear curve . </S>",
    "<S> it is a fairly good approximation for he , but a less good approximation for be where it underestimates the correlation energy for all @xmath0 , especially at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the presence of static correlation in this system that is not described by the pbe functional . finally , the linear interpolation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ecscaledlinear ] ) between mp2 ( evaluated with pbe orbitals ) and pbe appears as a good approximation for both he and be . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the linear interpolation is clearly the best approximation for be , at least with the pbe functional .    for a more comprehensive comparison of the different approximations </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed calculations on the ae6 and bh6 test sets  @xcite with the 1dh , ds1dh , and ls1dh double hybrids for the pbe functional , using a development version of the molpro 2010 program  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ae6 set is a small representative benchmark set of six atomization energies consisting of sih@xmath42 , s@xmath43 , sio , c@xmath44h@xmath42 ( propyne ) , c@xmath43h@xmath43o@xmath43 ( glyoxal ) , and c@xmath42h@xmath45 ( cyclobutane ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bh6 set is a small representative benchmark set of forward and reverse barrier heights of three reactions , oh + ch@xmath42 @xmath46 ch@xmath44 + h@xmath43o , h + oh @xmath46 o + h@xmath43 , and h + h@xmath43s @xmath46 hs + h@xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> all the calculations are performed at the optimized qcisd / mg3 geometries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the dunning cc - pvqz basis set  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> core electrons are kept frozen in all our mp2 calculations . </S>",
    "<S> spin - restricted calculations are performed for all the closed - shell systems , and spin - unrestricted calculations for all the open - shell systems . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ae6bh6 ] , we plot the mean absolute errors ( mae ) for the two sets as a function of @xmath0 . for the ae6 set , </S>",
    "<S> the maes of the ds1dh and ls1dh approximations are quite similar , and are both much smaller that the mae of the 1dh approximation for a wide range of @xmath0 . for the bh6 set </S>",
    "<S> , the ls1dh approximation gives a mae which is significantly smaller than those of both ds1dh and 1dh for intermediate values of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> as regards the choice of the parameter @xmath0 , the present data on the ah6 set gives an optimal value of @xmath47 for the ls1dh double hybrid , with a minimal mae of 3.59 kcal / mol , and for the bh6 set the optimal value is @xmath48 giving a minimal mae of 0.73 kcal / mol . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mae is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 around the optimal value , and brmond and adamo  @xcite have argued for using @xmath49 in defining the pbe0-dh approximation , using a similar argument as the one used by becke for his `` half - and - half '' hybrid  @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the new class of double - hybrid approximations named here ls1dh [ eq .  ( [ ls1dh ] ) ] can be understood as approximating the density - scaled correlation functional @xmath2 $ ] by a linear function of @xmath0 , interpolating between mp2 at @xmath3 and a density - functional approximation at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results obtained with the pbe density functional confirms that the ls1dh approximation is a relevant double - hybrid model , and in fact tends to be more accurate than the ds1dh double - hybrid model [ eq .  ( [ excds1dh ] ) ] in which density </S>",
    "<S> scaling is applied to the pbe correlation functional . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , it can be expected that the ls1dh double - hybrid model will be more accurate than the ds1dh double - hybrid model when applied with a density - functional approximation that is inaccurate in the high - density limit . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this work will help constructing other theoretically justified double - hybrid approximations . </S>"
