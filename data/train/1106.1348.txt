    "blazars are active galaxies believed to have pairs of relativistic jets flowing in opposite directions closely aligned to our line of sight . their spectral energy distributions ( seds )",
    "are dominated by beamed jet emission and take the form of two broad nonthermal components , one at low energy , peaking in the radio through optical , and one at high energies , peaking in the @xmath0-rays .",
    "some blazars have been well - monitored for decades and along a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "although there is ample evidence for the electron synchrotron origin of the low - energy bump , the existing data do not allow an unambiguous identification of the radiation mechanism responsible for the high - energy bump .",
    "one reason for this is that the high - energy bump is poorly constrained due to the lack of observations at energies between @xmath8 0.1  mev and 0.3  tev .",
    "this gap was filled to some extent by egret on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ @xcite . however , its moderate sensitivity and limited observing time precluded detailed cross - correlation studies between @xmath0-ray and lower - energy wavebands . on the other hand ,",
    "the current generation of tev imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , hess , magic , and veritas , which have good sensitivity at energies as low as 0.1 tev , did not start scientific operation until 2004 ; that is , well after egret had stopped operating .",
    "this has changed with the launch of the _ fermi _  gamma - ray space telescope in june 2008 . in science operation since 2008 august , its lat instrument @xcite views the entire sky in the 20 mev to greater than 300 gev range every three hours .",
    "the one year lat agn catalog ( 1lac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contains around 600 blazars , a factor of @xmath9 greater than egret detected during its entire operational lifetime . for the first time",
    ", simultaneous observations of _ fermi _  with the latest generation of iacts can cover the entire high - energy bump . combining this with simultaneous low - energy observations gives an unprecedented multiwavelength view of these enigmatic objects .",
    "blazars found in low states are particularly poorly studied .",
    "this is due in part to the lower sensitivity of previous instruments , and in part to the fact that multiwavelength monitoring programs , including space - based instruments , are mostly triggered when an object enters a particularly bright state , as observed by ground - based optical telescopes and all - sky monitors such as the _ rxte _",
    "@xcite all sky monitor ( asm ) or the _ swift _ @xcite burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",

    "mrk421 was actually the first extragalactic object to be discovered as a tev emitter @xcite , and one of the fastest varying @xmath0-ray sources @xcite . during the last decade",
    ", there were a large number of publications on the very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray spectrum of this source , which has been measured with almost all the existing iacts @xcite . among other things , we learned that the source shows evidence for a spectral hardening with increasing flux .",
    "the sed and the multifrequency correlations of mrk421 have also been intensively studied in the past through dedicated multifrequency observations of the source @xcite , which showed a positive but very complex relation between x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays , and that a simple one - zone synchrotron self - compton model ( ssc ) with an electron distribution parameterized with one or two power - laws seemed to describe the collected sed well during the observing campaigns . during a strong flare in june 2008 ,",
    "the source was also detected with the gamma - ray telescope agile and , for the first time , a hint of correlation between optical and tev energies was reported by @xcite .    despite the large number of publications on mrk421 , the details of the physical processes underlying the blazar emission are still unknown .",
    "the main reasons for this are the sparse multifrequency data during long periods of time , and the moderate sensitivity available in the past to study the @xmath0-ray emission of this source .",
    "in addition , as occurs often with studies of blazars , many of the previous multifrequency campaigns were triggered by an enhanced flux level at x - rays and/or @xmath0-rays , and hence many of the previous studies of this source are biased towards `` high - activity '' states , where perhaps distinct physical processes play a dominant role .",
    "moreover , we have very little information from the mev - gev energy range : 9 years of operation with egret resulted in only a few viewing periods with a signal significance of barely 5 standard deviations ( @xmath15 , hereafter ) @xcite , which precluded detailed correlation studies with other energy bands .",
    "we took advantage of the new capabilities provided by _",
    "fermi_-lat  and the new iacts , as well as the existing capabilities for observing at x - ray and lower frequencies , and organized a multifrequency ( from radio to tev ) campaign to observe mrk  421 over 4.5 months .",
    "the observational goal for this campaign was to sample mrk  421 every 2 days , which was accomplished at optical , x - rays and tev energies whenever the weather and/or technical operations allowed .",
    "fermi_-lat  operated in survey mode and thus the source was constantly observed at @xmath0-ray energies . in this paper , we report the overall sed averaged over the duration of the observing campaign",
    ". a more in - depth analysis of the multifrequency data set ( variability , correlations and implications ) will be given in a forthcoming paper .",

    "we report the flux / spectral variability in the @xmath0-ray range observed by _",
    "fermi_-lat  during the first 1.5 years of operation , and compare it with the flux variability obtained with rxte / asm and _ swift_/bat , which are also all - sky instruments .",
    "in section 4 we report on the spectrum of mrk  421 measured by fermi , and section 5 reports on the overall sed collected during the the 4.5 month long multi - wavelength campaign organized in 2009 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to sed modeling of the multifrequency data with both a hadronic and a leptonic model , and in section 7 we discuss the implications of the experimental and modeling results .",
    "finally , we conclude on section 8 .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat  is a @xmath0-ray telescope operating from @xmath16mev to @xmath17gev .",
    "the instrument is an array of @xmath18 identical towers , each one consisting of a tracker ( where the photons are pair - converted ) and a calorimeter ( where the energies of the pair - converted photons are measured ) . the entire instrument is covered with an anticoincidence detector to reject the charged - particle background .",
    "the lat has a large peak effective area ( @xmath19m@xmath20 for @xmath21gev photons ) , an energy resolution typically better than @xmath22 , and a field of view ( fov ) of about @xmath23sr with an angular resolution ( @xmath24 containment angle ) better than 1@xmath25 for energies above @xmath21gev .",
    "further details on the description of lat are given by @xcite .",
    "the lat data reported in this paper were collected from 2008 august 5 ( mjd 54683 ) to 2010 march 12 ( mjd 55248 ) . during this time ,",
    "the _ fermi_-lat  instrument operated almost entirely in survey mode .",
    "the analysis was performed with the sciencetools software package version v9r15p6 .",
    "only events having the highest probability of being photons , those in the `` diffuse '' class , were used .",
    "the lat data were extracted from a circular region with a @xmath26 radius centered at the location of mrk  421 .",
    "the spectral fits were performed using photon energies greater than @xmath1 gev , where the effective area of the instrument is large ( @xmath27m@xmath28 ) and the angular resolution relatively good ( @xmath24 containment angle smaller than 2@xmath25 ) .",
    "the spectral fits using energies above @xmath1gev are less sensitive to possible contamination from non - accounted ( transient ) neighboring sources , and have smaller systematic errors , at the expense of reducing somewhat the number of photons from the source .",
    "in addition , a cut on the zenith angle ( @xmath29 ) was also applied to reduce contamination from the earth limb @xmath0-rays , which are produced by cosmic rays interacting with the upper atmosphere .    the background model used to extract the @xmath0-ray signal includes a galactic diffuse emission component and an isotropic component .",
    "the model that we adopted for the galactic component is given by the file gll_iem_v02.fit , and the isotropic component , which is the sum of the extragalactic diffuse emission and the residual charged particle background , is parametrized by the file isotropic_iem_v02 .",
    "the normalization of both components in the background model were allowed to vary freely during the spectral point fitting . *",
    "the spectral analyses ( from which we derived spectral fits and photon fluxes ) were performed with the post - launch instrument response functions ` p6_v3_diffuse ` using an unbinned maximum likelihood method .",

    "hence the number of detected @xmath0-rays decreases from about 50 down to about 10 for time intervals of 7 days .",

    "this apparent discrepancy between the results reported in figure  [ fig : lc7days ] and the ones reported in figure [ fig : nva ] ( produced with the flux points from figure  [ fig : lc7daysmw ] ) might be due to the fact that , on time scales of 7-days , the photons below @xmath92gev dominate the determination of the pl photon index in the unbinned likelihood fit . in other words , the source is bright enough in the energy range @xmath97gev such that the ( relatively few ) photons above @xmath92gev do not have a large ( statistical ) weight in the computation of the pl photon index .",

    "the points are well within 1 - 2@xmath15 from the fit to the overall spectrum ( black line ) , which confirms that the entire _ fermi _  spectrum is consistent with a pure power law function .    however , it is worth noticing that the error bars at the highest energies are relatively large due to the low photon count . in the energy bins 60 - 160",
    "gev and 160 - 400 gev , the predicted ( by the model for mrk421 ) number of photons detected by lat is 33 and 11 , respectively . even though the low background makes those signals very significant ( ts values of 562 and 195 respectively ) , the statistical uncertainties in the energy flux values are naturally large and hence they could hide a potential turnover in the spectrum of mrk421 at around 100 gev . indeed , when performing the likelihood analysis on lat data above 100 gev , one obtains a photon flux above 100 gev of @xmath99ph@xmath5 s@xmath6 with a photon index of @xmath100 , which might suggest a turnover in the spectrum , consistent with the tev spectra determined by past observations with iacts @xcite . in order to make a statistical evaluation of this possibility , the lat spectrum ( in the range 0.3 - 400 gev ) was fit with a broken power law ( bpl ) function , obtaining the indices of @xmath101 and @xmath102 below and above the break energy of @xmath103 gev , respectively . the likelihood ratio of the bpl and the pl gave 0.7 , which , given the 2 extra degrees of freedom for the bpl function , indicates that the bpl function is not statistically preferred over the pl function .",
    "therefore , the statistical significance of the lat data above 100 gev is not sufficiently high to evaluate the potential existence of a break ( peak ) in the spectrum .",
    "as mentioned in  [ intro ] , we organized a multifrequency ( from radio to tev photon energies ) campaign to monitor mrk421 during a time period of 4.5 months .",

    "the rising tail of this peak was also measured with various radio instruments .",
    "especially important are the observations from sma at 225ghz , which help connecting the the bottom ( radio ) to the peak ( optical / x - rays ) of the synchrotron bump ( in the @xmath147 representation ) . the flux measurements by vlba , especially the ones corresponding to the core , provide us with the radio flux density from a region that is presumably not much larger than the blazar emission region .",
    "therefore , the radio flux densities from interferometric observations ( from the vlba core ) are expected to be close upper limits to the radio continuum of the blazar emission component . on the other hand ,",
    "the low frequency radio observations performed with single dish instruments have a relatively large contamination from the non - blazar emission and are probably considerably above the energy flux from the blazar emission region . *",
    "the only spectral intervals lacking observations are from 1 mev - 0.4ev , and 200 kev - 100 mev , where the sensitivity of the current instruments is insufficient to detect mrk421 .",
    "we note however , that the detailed gev coverage together with our broadband , 1-zone ssc modeling strongly constrains the expected emission in the difficult to access 1 mev - 0.4 ev bandpass .",
    "*    * during this campaign , mrk421 showed low activity and relatively small flux variations at all frequencies @xcite . at vhe ( @xmath54 100 gev ) , the measured flux is half the flux from the crab nebula , which is among the lowest fluxes recorded by magic for this source @xcite . at x - rays ,",
    "the fluxes observed during this campaign are about 15 mcrab , which is about 3 times higher than the lowest fluxes measured by rxte / asm since 1996 .",
    "therefore , because of the low flux , low ( multifrequency ) variability and the large density of observations , the collected data during this campaign can be considered an excellent proxy for the low / quiescent state sed of mrk421 . *",
    "it is worth stressing that the good agreement in the overlapping energies of the various instruments ( which had somewhat different time coverage during the campaign ) supports this hypothesis .",
    "* we turn now to modeling the multifrequency data set collected during the 4.5 month campaign in the context of homogeneous hadronic and leptonic models .",
    "the models discussed below assume emission mainly from a single , spherical and homogeneous region of the jet .",
    "this is a good approximation to model flaring events with observed correlated variability ( where the dynamical time scale does not exceed the flaring time scale significantly ) , although it is an over - simplification for quiescent states , where the measured blazar emission might be produced by the radiation from different zones characterized by different values of the relevant parameters .",
    "there are several models in the literature along those lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but at the cost of introducing more free parameters that are , consequently , less well constrained and more difficult to compare between models",
    ". this is particularly problematic if a `` limited '' data set ( in a time and energy coverage ) is employed in the modeling , although it could work well if the amount of multifrequency data is extensive enough to substantially constrain the parameter space . in this work we adopted the 1-zone homogeneous models for their simplicity as well as for being able to compare with previous works .",
    "the 1-zone homogeneous models are the most widely used models to describe the sed of high - peaked bl lacs . furthermore , although the modeled sed is averaged over 4.5 months of observations , the very low observed multifrequency variability during this campaign , and in particular the lack of strong kev and gev variability ( see figs [ fig : lc7days ] and [ fig : lc7daysmw ] ) in these timescales suggests that the presented data are a good representation of the average broad - band emission of mrk421 on timescales of few days .",
    "we , therefore , feel confident that the physical parameters required by our modeling to reproduce the average 4.5 month sed are a good representation of the physical conditions at the emission region down to timescales of a few days , which is comparable to the dynamical timescale derived from the models we discuss . the implications ( and caveats ) of the modeling results",

    "it would also allow a larger tolerance on the size region r , which is considered to be small in the spb model fit presented here .",
    "the simplest leptonic model typically used to describe the emission from bl lac objects is the 1-zone synchrotron self - compton model ( ssc ) . within this framework ,",
    "the radio through x - ray emission is produced by synchrotron radiation from electrons in a homogeneous , randomly - oriented magnetic field ( @xmath153 ) and the the @xmath0-rays are produced by inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons by the same electrons which produce them . for this purpose ,",

    "we use the same approach in this work .",
    "however , we find that , in order to properly describe the shape of the measured broad - band sed during the 4.5 months long campaign , the model requires an electron distribution parameterized with three pl functions ( and hence two breaks ) . in other words , we must add 2 extra free parameters to the model : the second break at @xmath187 and the index of the third pl function @xmath188 .",
    "note that a second break was also needed to describe the sed of mrk 501 in the context of the synchrotron / ssc model @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility might be to use an electron distribution parametrized with a curved function such as that resulting from episodic particle acceleration @xcite or the log - parabolic function used in @xcite .",
    "however , we note that such a parameterization might have problems describing the highest x - ray energies , where the current sed data ( rxte / pca and _ swift_/bat ) do not show a large spectrum curvature .",

    "in addition , given that this only gives an upper limit on the size scale , and the history of fast variability detected for this object ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is worth stressing the good agreement between the model and the data : the model describes very satisfactorily the entire measured broad - band sed .",
    "the model goes through the sma ( 225ghz ) data point , as well as through the vlba ( 43ghz ) data point for the partially - resolved radio core .",
    "the size of the vlba core of the 2009 data from mrk421 at 15ghz and 43ghz is @xmath196 0.060.12mas ( as reported in section [ radio ] ) or , using the conversion scale 0.61pc / mas @xmath196 12 @xmath197 cm .",
    "the vlba size estimation is the fwhm of a gaussian representing the brightness distribution of the blob , which could be approximated as 0.9 times the radius of a corresponding spherical blob @xcite .",

    "this is particularly relevant because , for power - law distributions with index p @xmath54 2 , the jet power carried by the electrons is dominated by the low energy electrons . *",
    "therefore , the tight constraints on @xmath184 translate into tight constraints on the jet power carried by the electrons . for instance , in the case of the model with @xmath241hour , using @xmath242 ( instead of @xmath243 ) would reduce the jet power carried by electrons from @xmath244 erg s@xmath6 down to @xmath245 erg s@xmath6 .",

    "again , since these constrains did not exist ( or were not used ) in the past , most of the 1-zone ssc model results ( for mrk421 ) in the literature report a @xmath212 value that differs from the one reported in this work .",
    "we note however that the values for the parameters @xmath213 and @xmath188 from our model fits , which are constrained mostly by the x - ray / tev data , are actually quite similar to the parameters @xmath212 and @xmath213 from the previous 1-zone ssc model fits to mrk421 data .",
    "* in this section of the paper we discuss the implications of the experimental and sed modeling results presented in the previous sections . as explained at the beginning of section 6 , for simplicity and for the sake of comparison with previously published results , we modeled the sed with scenarios based on 1-zone homogeneous emitting regions , which are commonly used to parameterize the broad - band emission in blazars .",
    "we note that this is a simplification of the problem ; the emission in blazar jets could be produced in an inhomogeneous or stratified region , as well as in n independent regions .",
    "an alternative and quite realistic scenario could be a standing shock where particle acceleration takes place and radiation is being produced as the jet flow or superluminal knots cross it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lorentz factor of the plasma , as it flows through the standing ( and by necessity oblique ) shock is the lorentz factor ( and through setting the angle , the doppler factor ) of the model .",
    "we note however that , as discussed in @xcite , the steady - sate emission could also be parametrized by n moving blobs that only radiate when passing through the standing shock .",
    "if at any given moment , only one of these blobs were visible at the observer frame , the 1-zone homogeneous model could be a plausible approximation of the standing - shock scenario .",
    "*    in any case , the important thing is that , in the proposed physical scenario , the stability time - scale of the particle accelerating shock front is not connected to the much shorter cooling times that give rise to spectral features . for as long as the injection of particles in the blob and the dynamics of the blob remain unchanged",
    ", the sed , along with the breaks due to radiative cooling and due to the value of @xmath184 where fermi acceleration presumably picks up , will remain unchanged .",
    "the lack of ( substantial ) multifrequency variability observed during this campaign suggests that this is the case , and hence that the 4.5-months - averaged sed is also representative of the broad - band emission of sed during much shorter periods of time that are comparable to the dynamical timescales derived from the models .      in our homogenous leptonic model",
    "we reproduce the location of the @xmath246 peaks by fitting the lorentz factors @xmath247 and @xmath187 ( as well as the values of @xmath153 and @xmath152 ) where the electron energy distribution breaks .",
    "there is , however , a lorentz factor where one typically ( in blazar modeling ) expects a break in the electron energy distribution ( eed ) , and this is the lorentz factor @xmath248 where the escape time from the source equals the radiative ( synchrotron ) cooling time .",
    "the fact that the values of the second break , @xmath187 , fit by our leptonic models @xmath249 are similar to the lorentz factors @xmath250 ) where a cooling break in the eed is expected , strongly suggests that the second break in the eed derived from the modeling is indeed the cooling break .    the observed spectral shape in both the low and high energy sed components are reproduced in our homogenous model by a change of electron index @xmath251 .",
    "such a large break in the eed is in contrast to the canonical cooling break @xmath252 that produces a spectral index change of @xmath253 , as predicted for homogenous models ( e.g. , longair 1994 ) .",
    "an attempt to model the data fixing @xmath254 gave unsatisfactory results , and hence this is not an option ; a large spectral break is needed .",
    "it would be tempting to speculate that what we observe is not a cooling break , but rather something that results from a characteristic of the acceleration process which is not understood and that , therefore , does not bind us to the @xmath255 constraint .",
    "but we would then have to attribute to shear fortuity the fact that the lorentz factors where this break takes place are very close to the lorentz factors where cooling is actually expected .",
    "the question that naturally arises is why , although the eed break postulated by the homogeneous model is at nearly the same energy as the expected cooling break , the spectral break observed is stronger .",
    "such strong breaks are the rule rather than the exception in some non - thermal sources like pulsar - wind nebulae and extragalactic jets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the explanations that have been given relax the assumption of a homogenous emitting zone , invoking gradients in the physical quantities describing the system @xcite . in all inhomogenous models , electrons are injected at an inlet and are advected downstream suffering radiative losses that result in the effective size of the source declining with increasing frequency for a given spectral component . in sources where the beaming of the emitted radiation is the same throughout the source ( this is the case for non - relativistic flows or for relativistic flows with small velocity gradients ) ,",
    "the spectral break formed is stronger than the canonical @xmath256 if the physical conditions change in such a way that the emissivity at a given frequency increases downstream ( wilson 1975 , coleman & bicknell 1988 , reynolds 2009 ) .    if , in addition to these considerations , we allow for significant relativistic velocity gradients , either in the form of a decelerating flow @xcite or the form of a fast spine and slow sheath flow @xcite , the resulting differential beaming of the emitted radiation can result in spectral breaks stronger that @xmath257 .",
    "studies of the seds of sources with different jet orientations ( e.g. radio galaxies and blazars ) can help to understand the importance of differential beaming , and therefore of relativistic velocity gradients in these flows . because in all these models the volume of the source emitting at a given frequency is connected to the predicted spectral break",
    ", it should be possible to use the variability time - scale at different frequencies to constrain the physics of the inhomogenous flow .      as mentioned in ",
    "[ mwseddataresults ] , the sed emerging from the multifrequency campaign is the most complete and accurate representation of the low / quiescent state of mrk421 to date .",
    "this data provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to constrain and tune state - of - the - art modeling codes . in  [ sedmodel ] we modeled the sed within two different frameworks : a leptonic and a hadronic scenario .",
    "both models are able to represent the overall sed .",
    "as can be seen in figures [ hadronicmodelsed ] and [ modelsed ] , the leptonic model fits describe the observational data somewhat better than the hadronic model ; yet we also note here that , in this paper , the leptonic model has one more free parameter than the hadronic model . a very efficient way of discriminating between the two scenarios would be through multi - wavelength variability observations .",
    "it is however interesting to discuss the differences between the two model descriptions we presented above .      the characteristic size to which the size of the emitting region must be compared is the gravitational radius of the mrk 421 black hole .",
    "for a black hole mass of @xmath258 @xcite , the corresponding size is @xmath259 cm . in the hadronic model",
    "the source size can be as small as @xmath260 cm ( larger source sizes can not be ruled out though ; see sect .",
    "6.1 ) , within one order of magnitude of the gravitational radius .",
    "the consequence is a dense synchrotron photon energy density that facilitates frequent interactions with relativistic protons , resulting in a strong reprocessed / cascade component which leads to a softening of the spectrum occurring mostly below 100 mev .",
    "the fermi - lat analysis presented in this paper ( which used the instrument response function given by ` p6_v3_diffuse ` ) is not sensitive to these low energies and hence the evaluation of this potential softening in the spectrum will have to be done with future analyses ( and more data ) .",
    "this will potentially allow accurate determination of spectra down to photon energies of @xmath261 mev with the lat .",
    "the leptonic model can accommodate a large range of values for @xmath106 , as long as it is not so compact that internal @xmath262 attenuation becomes too strong and absorbs the tev @xmath0-rays . in the particular case of @xmath198day , which is supported by the low activity and low multifrequency variability observed during the campaign , @xmath263 cm , that is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational radius . under the assumption that the emission comes from the entire ( or large fraction of the ) cross - section of the jet , and assuming a conical jet , the location of the emitting region would be given by @xmath264 , where @xmath265 .",
    "therefore , under these assumptions , which are valid for large distances ( @xmath266 ) when the outflow is fully formed , the leptonic model would put the emission region at @xmath267 .",
    "we note however that , since the @xmath106 for the leptonic model is considered an upper limit on the blob size scale ( see eqn .",
    "[ rb_eqn ] ) , this distance should also be considered as an upper limit as well .",
    "the particle content predicted by the hadronic and leptonic scenarios are different by construction . in the hadronic scenario presented in  [ hadronicmodelsedtext ] , the dominantly radiating particles are protons , secondary electron / positron pairs , muons , and pions , in addition to the primary electrons . in the leptonic scenario ,",
    "the dominantly radiating particles are the primary electrons only . in both cases ,",
    "the distribution of particles are clearly non - thermal and acceleration mechanisms are required .    in the leptonic scenario ,",
    "the pl index @xmath268 , which is the canonical particle spectral index from efficient 1st - order fermi acceleration at the fronts of relativistic shocks , suggests that this process is at work in mrk421 . for",
    "electrons to be picked up by 1st - order fermi acceleration in perpendicular shocks , their larmor radius is required to be significantly larger than the width of the shock , which for electron - proton plasmas is set by the larmor radius of the dynamically dominant particles ( electrons or protons ) . *",
    "the large @xmath184 ( @xmath269 ) provided by the model implies that electrons are efficiently accelerated by the fermi mechanism only above this energy and that below this energy they are accelerated by a different mechanism that produces an extremely hard electron distribution .",
    "* such pre - acceleration mechanisms have been discussed in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the suggestion that the fermi mechanism picks up only after @xmath184 ( @xmath269 ) suggests a large thickness of the shock , which would imply that the shock is dominated by ( cold ) protons .",
    "we refer the reader to the _ fermi_-lat  paper on mrk501 @xcite for more detailed discussion on this topic .",
    "in addition , in  [ leptonicmodel ] and  [ breaks ] we argued that the second break @xmath270 ( @xmath271 gev ) is probably due to synchrotron cooling ( the electrons radiate most of their energy before existing the region of size @xmath106 ) , but the first break @xmath272 ( @xmath273 gev ) must be related to the acceleration mechanism ; and hence the leptonic model also requires that electrons above the first break are accelerated less efficiently . at this point it is interesting to note that the 1-zone ssc model of mrk501 in 2009 ( where the source was also observed mostly in a quiescent state ) , returned @xmath274 gev with essentially the same spectral change ( 0.5 ) in the electron distribution @xcite . therefore , the first break ( presumedly related to the acceleration mechanism ) is of the same magnitude and located approximately at the same energy for both mrk421 and mrk501 , which might suggest a common property in the quiescent state of hsp bl lac objects detected at tev energies .",

    "we note that , for hsp - bllacs , the high energy bump is believed to be produced by the eed upscattering seed - photons from a wide energy range ( the synchrotron photons emitted by the eed itself ) and hence all the features from the eed are smoothed out . on the other hand , in the other blazar objects like fsrqs",

    "another interesting observation is that , at least for one of the fsrqs , 3c454.3 , the location and the magnitude of the break seems to be insensitive to flux variations @xcite . if the break observed in mrk421 and mrk501 is of the same nature than that of 3c454.3",

    "this is depicted in figure  [ fig : sed_gammazoom ] .",
    "the contributions of different segments of the eed are indicated by different colors . as shown",
    ", the low - energy electrons , @xmath294 , which are emitting synchrotron photons up to the observed frequencies of @xmath295hz , dominate the production of @xmath0-rays up to the observed photon energies of @xmath820gev ( green line ) .",
    "the contribution of higher energy electrons with lorentz factors @xmath296 is pronounced within the observed synchrotron range @xmath297hz , and at @xmath0-ray energies from @xmath820gev up to @xmath8tev ( blue line ) .",
    "finally , the highest energy tail of the electron energy distribution , @xmath298 , responsible for the production of the observed x - ray synchrotron continuum ( @xmath299kev ) generates the bulk of @xmath0-rays with the observed energies @xmath54tev ( purple line ) . because of the electrons upscattering the broad energy range of synchrotron photons , the emission of the different electron segments are somewhat connected , as shown in the bottom plot of figure  [ fig : sed_gammazoom ]",
    "specifically , the low energy electrons have also contributed to the tev photon flux through the emitted synchrotron photons which are being upscattered by the high energy electrons .",
    "hence , changes in the number of low energy electrons should also have an impact on the tev photon flux .",
    "however , note that the synchrotron photons emitted by the high energy electrons , which are up - scattered in the klein - nishina regime , do not have any significant contribution to the gamma - ray flux , thus changes in the number of high energy electrons ( say @xmath300 ) will not significantly change the mev / gev photon flux .    within our 1-zone ssc scenario , the @xmath0-rays measured by _",
    "fermi_-lat  are mostly produced by the low energy electrons ( @xmath301 ) while the x - rays seen by asm and bat are mostly produced by the highest energy electrons ( @xmath298 ) . in this scenario , the significantly higher variability in the x - rays with respect to that of @xmath0-rays suggests that the flux variations in mrk421 are dominated by changes in the number of the highest energy electrons .",
    "note that the same trend is observed in the x - rays ( asm versus bat ) and @xmath0-rays ( below versus above @xmath92gev ) ; the variability in the emission increases with the energy of the radiating electrons .",
    "the greater variability in the radiation produced by the highest energy electrons is not surprising .",
    "the cooling timescales of the electrons from synchrotron and inverse compton ( in the thomson regime ) losses scale as @xmath302 , and hence it is expected that the emission from higher energy electrons will be the most variable . however , since the high energy electrons are the ones losing their energy fastest , in order to keep the source emitting in x - rays , injection ( acceleration ) of electrons up to the highest energies is needed",
    ". this injection ( acceleration ) of high energy electrons could well be the origin of the flux variations in mrk421 .",
    "the details of this high energy electron injection could be parameterized by changes in the parameters @xmath303 , @xmath188 and @xmath185 within the framework of the 1-zone ssc model that could result from episodic acceleration events @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the sed evolution ( and hence ssc parameter variations ) will be one of the prime subjects of the forthcoming publications with the multi - instrument variability and correlation during the campaigns in 2009 and 2010 .",
    "we note here that ssc models , both one - zone and multi - zone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , predict a positive correlation between the x - rays and the tev @xmath0-rays measured by iacts . indeed , during the 2010 campaign the source was detected in a flaring state with the tev instruments ( see atel # 2443 ) .",
    "such an x - ray / tev correlation has been established in the past for this object ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the relation is not simple .",
    "sometimes it is linear and other times quadratic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the complexity of this correlation is also consistent with our 1-zone ssc model ; the x - rays are produced by electrons with @xmath304 , while the tev photons are produced by electrons with @xmath305 , and is indirectly affected by the electrons with @xmath306 through the emitted synchrotron photons that are used as seed photons for the inverse compton scattering ( see the bottom plot of figure  [ fig : sed_gammazoom ] ) .",
    "we also note that the 1-zone ssc scenario presented here predicts a direct correlation on the basis of simultaneous data sets between the low energy gamma - rays ( from _ fermi _ ) and the sub - millimeter ( sma ) and optical frequencies , since both energy bands are produced by the lowest energy electrons in the source . on the other hand",
    ", our spb model fit does not require such a strict correlation , but there could be a loose correlation if electrons and protons are accelerated together .",
    "in particular , a direct correlation with zero time lag between the mm radio frequencies and the @xmath0-rays is not expected in our spb model because the radiation at these two energy bands are produced at different sites .",
    "the radiation in the x- and @xmath0-ray band originates from the primary electrons , and from * the protons and * secondary particles created by proton - initiated processes , respectively .",
    "consequently , although a loose correlation between the x - ray and @xmath0-ray band can be expected if protons and electrons are accelerated together , a strict correlation with zero time lag is rather unlikely in our model fit .    during the 2009 and 2010 campaigns ,",
    "mrk421 was very densely sampled during a very long baseline ( 4.5 and 6 months for the 2009 and 2010 campaign , respectively ) and hence these data sets will provide excellent information for performing a very detailed study of these multi - band relations . in particular , during the campaign in 2010 , there were regular observations with vlba and sma , which will allow us to study with a greater level of detail the relationship between the rising parts of the low energy and high energy bumps , where the predictions from the leptonic and hadronic models differ .",
    "in this work , we reported on the @xmath0-ray activity of mrk421 as measured by the lat instrument on board the _ fermi _  satellite during its first 1.5 years of operation , from 2008 august 5 ( mjd 54683 ) to 2009 march 12 ( mjd 55248 ) .",
    "because of the large leap in capabilities of lat with respect to its predecessor , egret , this is the most extensive study of the @xmath0-ray activity of this object at gev photon energies to date .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat  spectrum ( quantified with a single power - law function ) was evaluated for 7-day - long time intervals .",
    "the average photon flux above @xmath1gev was found to be @xmath307ph@xmath5s@xmath6 , and the average photon index @xmath143 .",
    "the photon flux changed significantly ( up to a factor @xmath7 ) while the spectral variations were mild .",
    "the variations in the pl photon index were not statistically significant , yet the light curves and variability quantification below and above @xmath92gev showed that the high @xmath0-ray energies vary more than the low energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "we found @xmath93gev@xmath308 while @xmath309gev@xmath96 .",
    "we compared the lat @xmath0-ray activity in these two energy ranges ( @xmath61gev and @xmath310gev ) with the x - ray activity recorded by the all - sky instruments rxte / asm ( @xmath64kev ) and _ swift_/bat ( @xmath60kev ) .",
    "we found that x - rays are significantly more variable than @xmath0-rays , with no significant ( @xmath311@xmath312 ) correlation between them .",
    "we also found that , within the x - ray and @xmath0-ray energy bands , the variability increased with photon energy .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result within the context of the 1-zone ssc model is that the variability in the radiation increases with the energy of the electrons that produce them , which is expected given the radiating time scales for synchrotron and inverse compton emission .",
    "we also presented the first results from the 4.5-month - long multifrequency campaign on mrk421 , which lasted from 2009 january 19 ( mjd 54850 ) to 2009 june 1 ( mjd 54983 ) . during this time period ,",
    "the source was systematically observed from radio to tev energies . because of the low activity and low variability shown during this campaign , the compiled data provided us with the best sed yet of mrk421 in the low / quiescent state .",
    "the broadband sed was modeled with two different scenarios : a leptonic ( 1 zone ssc ) and a hadronic model ( spb ) .",
    "both frameworks are able to describe reasonably well the average sed , implying comparable powers for the jet emission , which constitute only a small fraction ( @xmath313 ) of the eddington luminosity .",
    "however , those models differ on the predicted environment for the blazar emission : the leptonic scenario constrains the size to be @xmath314 , the magnetic field to @xmath315 g and particles ( electrons ) with energies up to @xmath316 ev while , if @xmath317 , our hadronic scenario implies a size of the emitting region of a few @xmath276 , a magnetic field @xmath318 g and particles ( protons ) with energies up to @xmath319 ev , which requires extreme conditions for particle acceleration and confinement .",
    "the leptonic scenario suggests that the acceleration of the radiating particles ( electrons ) is through diffusive shock acceleration in relativistic shocks mediated by cold protons , and that this mechanism accelerates particles ( electrons ) less efficiently above an energy of @xmath320 gev , which is comparable to what was reported in @xcite for another classical tev blazar , mrk501 .",
    "in addition , unlike what was observed for mrk501 , in the case of mrk421 a stronger - than - canonical electron cooling break was required to reproduce the observed sed , which might suggest that the blazar emitting region is inhomogeneous .    within the ssc model ( figure  [ modelsed ] ) , the observed x - ray/@xmath0-ray variability during the first 1.5 years of _ fermi _",
    "operation indicates that the flux variations in mrk421 are produced by acceleration of the highest energy electrons , which radiate in the x - ray and tev bands , and lose energy , radiating as they do so in the optical and gev range . in our hadronic model",
    "( figure  [ hadronicmodelsed ] ) , a rather loose correlation between the x- and @xmath0-ray band is expected if electrons and protons are accelerated together . a forthcoming publication will report on whether these emission models can reproduce the multi - band flux variations observed during the intensive campaigns on mrk421 performed in 2009 and 2010 .",
    "those studies should help us distinguish between the hadronic and the leptonic scenarios and eventually lead to a better understanding of one of the fundamental mysteries of blazars : how flux variations are produced .",
