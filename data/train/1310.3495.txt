    "although type - ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have been used to measure extragalactic distances and thus reveal the accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite , the nature of the stellar system that leads to these explosions remains unclear ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the current consensus is that the progenitor is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( co wd ) that accretes matter from a binary companion until the pressure or temperature somewhere in the wd become high enough to ignite the carbon and lead to a thermonuclear explosion of the wd @xcite .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to explain the nature of the binary companion and the process of mass accretion .",
    "the leading scenarios are the single - degenerate scenario ( sd ; @xcite ) , in which the binary companion is either a main - sequence star , a subgiant just leaving the main sequence , a red giant , or a stripped `` he star , '' and the wd accretes mass from the secondary through roche - lobe overflow or a stellar wind . in the double - degenerate scenario ( dd ;",
    "@xcite ) , the companion is a second co wd and the two wds merge due to loss of energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves .",
    "each of these scenarios predicts a different form of the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst of star formation and any subsequent sn  ia events , known as the delay - time distribution ( dtd ; see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the dtd can be thought of as a transfer function connecting the star - formation history ( sfh ) of a specific stellar environment and that environment s sn  ia rate .",
    "thus , by measuring the sn  ia rate and comparing it to the sfh , one might reconstruct the dtd . the sn  ia dtd has been recovered using several techniques applied to different sn samples collected from different types of stellar environments ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the emerging picture is that of a power - law dtd with an index of @xmath6 , a form that arises naturally from the dd scenario , although combinations of dtds from a dd channel and a sd channel can not be ruled out .",
    "one method to recover the dtd , @xmath7 , is to measure the sn  ia rate , @xmath8 , as a function of cosmic time @xmath9 in field galaxies , and compare them to the cosmic sfh , @xmath10 : @xmath11    measurements of the volumetric sn  ia rates ( i.e. , the sn  ia rates per unit volume ) in field galaxies agree out to @xmath12 .",
    "* g11 ) provide a compilation of all sn  ia rates measured up to 2011 , and later measurements are presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "volumetric sn  ia rate measurements were first extended to @xmath13 by @xcite , with additional data analyzed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d08 ) , using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) to survey the goods fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "the /goods survey discovered 20 sne  ia at @xmath14 and 3 at @xmath15 .",
    "g11 conducted a sn survey in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) using the 8.2-m subaru telescope and discovered 27 sn  ia candidates at @xmath16 and 10 at @xmath17 .",
    "the sn  ia rate uncertainties at @xmath13 , and especially at @xmath18 , are dominated by small - number statistics .",
    "the three @xmath19 /goods sne  ia were discovered in host galaxies having a spectroscopic redshift ( spec-@xmath20 ) and no active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity . on the other hand ,",
    "the classification of the larger sdf sn sample from g11 relies on photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath20 ) measurements that might be systematically biased toward high redshifts ( see their section 4.2 ) .",
    "while g11 also used several methods to weed out interloping agns , there could still be some agn contamination because each sn in the sdf sample was only observed on one epoch . the /goods sample , while smaller than the sdf sample , suffers from lower systematic uncertainties owing to the spectroscopic classification of the sn host galaxies and measurements of their redshifts , and a better sampling of the sn light curves . of the 10 @xmath18 sn host galaxies in the sdf sample ,",
    "only one galaxy has so far had its redshift and lack of agn activity confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "although the goods and sdf @xmath13 sn  ia rates are consistent , their interpretation differs between the two groups . based on the goods data",
    ", @xcite argued that the sn  ia rate declined at @xmath21 .",
    "fitting this declining sn  ia rate evolution , @xcite and @xcite surmised that the dtd is confined to delay times of 34 gyr .",
    "in contrast , based on the sdf data , g11 found that the sn  ia rate evolution does not decline at high redshifts , but rather levels off , as would be expected of a power - law dtd .",
    "two new sn surveys are attempting to resolve this conflict .",
    "these surveys are components of two three - year  multi - cycle treasury programs that use the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the new wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) .",
    "results from the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; @xcite ) will be reported by rodney et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . here , we describe results from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( clash ; @xcite ) .",
    "clash imaged 25 galaxy clusters in 16 broad - band filters from the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) to the near - infrared ( nir ) with the acs and wfc3 cameras working in parallel mode .",
    "while one camera was pointed at the galaxy cluster , the other one was used to observe a parallel field far enough from the galaxy cluster so as not to be significantly affected by strong lensing . in this work ,",
    "we report a sample of 27 sne discovered in the parallel fields of the 25 clash galaxy clusters . in section [ sec : clash_obs ] , we describe the clash observations and our imaging and spectroscopic follow - up program .",
    "we report our sn sample in section [ sec : clash_sne ] , where we also conduct detection - efficiency simulations and classify the sne . using our sn  ia sample , we measure sn  ia rates out to @xmath22 in section [ sec : clash_rates ] and use them to test different forms of the dtd in section [ sec : clash_dtd ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : clash_conclude ] . throughout this work",
    ", we assume a @xmath23-cold - dark - matter cosmological model with parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26  km  s@xmath27  mpc@xmath27 .",
    "unless noted otherwise , all magnitudes are on the vega system .",
    "we designate our sn candidates according to the cluster and year in which they were discovered and the first three letters of the nickname given to them for internal tracking purposes .",
    "for example , cli11had is a clash ( cl ) sn that was discovered in one of the parallel fields around the ninth ( or ith ) cluster , macs0717.5 + 3745 , in 2011 , and was nicknamed `` hadrian . ''",
    "for the sake of brevity , we will henceforth refer to our sn candidates simply as sne .",
    "the clash observation strategy is described in detail by @xcite . during cycles 1820 ,",
    "clash observed 25 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.1870.890 .",
    "the central region of each galaxy cluster was imaged with 16 broad - band filters from the nuv to the nir using the acs and wfc3 cameras on . in acs",
    ", we used the wide field channel ( wfc ) , with a field of view of @xmath28 and a pixel scale of @xmath29 pixel@xmath27 .",
    "wfc3 includes two detectors : an infrared channel ( wfc3-ir ) with a field of view of @xmath30 and a scale of @xmath31 pixel@xmath27 ; and an ultraviolet  visible channel ( wfc3-uvis ) with a field of view of @xmath32 and a scale of @xmath33 pixel@xmath27 .",
    "the orientation of  and the cadence between succeeding visits to the galaxy cluster ( `` prime '' ) field were chosen so that two acs and two wfc3 parallel fields would each be observed on four separate occasions , with a median cadence of 18 days .",
    "each visit to a wfc3 parallel field consisted of one orbit comprising two  filter exposures and one exposure in filters  and  each ( filter+system central wavelengths @xmath34 15,369 , 12,486 , and 5846   , respectively ) .",
    "visits to the acs parallel fields consisted of one orbit when the prime field was imaged with either the acs or wfc3-ir cameras and two orbits when the prime field was imaged with the wfc3-uvis camera . during single - orbit visits ,",
    "the parallel acs orbit comprised four  filter exposures and one  filter exposure ( filter+system central wavelengths",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36   , respectively ) .",
    "when the acs parallel fields were imaged over two orbits , they consisted of six  and two  exposures .",
    "these filters , the reddest in each camera , were chosen to detect high - redshift sne .",
    "the  band was added to the wfc3 observations for additional color information to aid in the classification of any sne discovered in those fields .",
    "the  angular resolution in our search bands is @xmath37 and @xmath38 in  and , respectively , slightly larger than the pixel scales of their respective cameras .",
    "table  [ table : clash_exptime ] lists the typical exposure times and @xmath39 limiting magnitudes reached in each of these filters .",
    "the limiting magnitude in each filter was calculated using the method outlined in @xcite : we conducted aperture photometry on hundreds of blank regions in the image , fit a gaussian to the negative side of the resultant histogram ( as the positive tail could be contaminated by light from the sources in the image ) , and treated the standard deviation of the fit as an estimate of the average noise in the image .",
    "we used circular apertures with radii of 4 , 3 , and 5 pixels , which correspond to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 in the pixel scale to which we drizzle the images taken with acs , wfc3-ir , and wfc3-uvis : 0.05 , 0.09 , and 0.04 arcsec pixel@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "an additional 52  orbits were allocated for follow - up imaging or slitless spectroscopy of targets of opportunity , such as high - redshift sne  ia .",
    "this cache of orbits was added to the 150 similar  orbits allocated to the candels program , for a sum of 202 follow - up orbits for the combined clash+candels sn survey ( pi : a. riess ) .",
    "our  reduction and image - subtraction pipeline is described in detail by rodney et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "briefly , the raw  images were first calibrated using the stsdas calibration tools .",
    "the calibrations include bias correction , dark subtraction , and flat fielding . in the case of wfc3-ir images , ``",
    "up - the - ramp '' fitting was used to remove cosmic ray ( cr ) events .",
    "charge - transfer efficiency losses in the acs images were corrected using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "next , the subexposures in each filter were combined using multidrizzle ( @xcite ) .",
    "this stage also removed the geometrical distortion of the  focal plane . for each filter",
    ", we created `` template '' images comprised of all previous observations in the same filter .",
    "this means that some sn light may be included in the template images , which we take into account in section [ sec : clash_rates ] .",
    "finally , we subtracted the template images from the drizzled `` target '' images to produce the difference images that were then searched for sne . owing to the stable point - spread - function ( psf ) of , we did not need to degrade the psf of either the target or template images to match the psf of the images , as done in ground - based sn surveys ( e.g. , g11 ) .",
    ".typical exposure times for clash parallel fields [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     as has been commented elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the bps dtds , both for dd and sd scenarios , fail to produce the number of observed sne  ia . here",
    ", we test the shape of the bps dtds by treating their scaling as a free parameter . the resultant sn  ia rate evolutions are presented in figure  [ fig : clash_bps_dtds ] .",
    "the bps dd models require scalings by small factors of 39 and result in reduced @xmath42 values of @xmath43 , consistent with the sn  ia rates .",
    "the bps sd models , on the other hand , require large scaling factors of @xmath44 ( except for the wang / han and mennekens dtds , which require scaling factors of @xmath45 ) and result in reduced @xmath42 values of @xmath46 , thus excluding all bps sd models at a @xmath5% significance level .",
    "the poor fits of the sd models are the result of their low dtd amplitudes at long delay times . the accurate and precise @xmath4 sn  ia rates , which are most sensitive to the long delay - time component of the dtd , have the most leverage on the scalings of the bps sd dtds .",
    "because the sd models have low amplitudes at long delay times , the @xmath4 sn  ia rates force scalings of large factors that then cause the resultant sn  ia rate evolutions to overshoot the @xmath13 rates .",
    "it is instructive to compare some of the sd dtd models , and their resultant sn  ia rate evolutions , in detail .",
    "the claeys model has the lowest amplitude at long delay times , which is why its resultant sn  ia rate evolution overshoots all the other models in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : clash_bps_dtds ] . on the other hand , although the yungelson model only has an intermediate delay - time component , that component is at longer delay times than the claeys model , so it results in a sn  ia rate evolution with less amplitude than the rate evolution produced by the claeys model . finally , the ruiter model has the highest amplitude at long delay times , after the wang / han model , which results in a low scaling .",
    "however , the ruiter model has lower amplitude at short delay times , compared to all other dtd models besides yungelson , which is why the low scaling , forced by the long - delay component , results in a sn  ia rate evolution that undershoots the @xmath13 sn  ia rates .",
    "in this work , we have presented a sample of 27 sne discovered in the parallel fields of the 25 clash galaxy clusters . of these",
    ", @xmath0 were classified as sne  ia , four of which are at @xmath1 . using the sn  ia sample",
    ", we measured the sn  ia rate out to @xmath47 and obtained an upper limit on the rate in the redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "within the uncertainties of all the measurements , these rates are consistent with both the /goods and the subaru / sdf sn  ia rates . based on these rates , along with previous rates from the literature",
    ", we have shown that when convolved with different cosmic sfhs , a power - law dtd with an index of  is consistent with the data .",
    "the systematic uncertainty derives from the wide range of possible sfhs considered .",
    "we have also shown that the overall shape of dtds from bps dd models are consistent with the sn  ia rate measurements , as long as the models are scaled up by factors of 39 , while all bps sd models are ruled out at a @xmath5% significance level .",
    "the sn  ia rates at @xmath4 require a dtd with a significant delayed component , such as the power - law dtd tested here .",
    "the high - redshift sn  ia rates provide a probe of the early times of the dtd , where the dtd could either continue with an index of @xmath6 , as found here , or perhaps transit to a lower index of @xmath48 , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "if the sd scenario contributes significantly to the sn  ia rate , as claimed by some recent work ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , its main effect would be on the high - redshift rates",
    ". however , to have any real discriminatory power on the different dtd models , the sn  ia rates at @xmath13 must be more accurate and precise than they currently are . to make the most efficient use of the clash sn sample",
    ", we will combine it with the final candels sample in a future paper .",
    "together , the two samples will contain a similar number of sne  ia as the subaru / sdf sample from g11 . however , their systematic uncertainties will be lower , as they will make use of light curves and spectroscopy , where available , as done in this work .",
    "finally , the upcoming  frontier fields program ( pi : m.  mountain ) will observe six pairs of galaxy clusters and blank fields containing field galaxies , using 140 orbits of acs and wfc3 for each pair of galaxy cluster / blank field during cycles 2123 . based on our work on clash and candels",
    ", we expect that this survey , which will go deeper than either of the previous surveys , will discover @xmath49 sne , including five @xmath18 sne  ia .",
    "once this sample is added to the combined clash+candels sn sample , we may finally have high - redshift sn  ia rates accurate enough to probe the early part of the dtd .",
