    "the specificity of the gbar project is to prepare a single antihydrogen atom at a temperature of the order of 10  @xmath4k , to obtain a sub - percent accuracy@xcite on @xmath2 . after a brief explanation of the scheme proposed for the gbar experiment",

    ", neutral antihydrogen is prepared by photodetachment of the excess positron of a sympathetically cooled @xmath0 trapped ion .",
    "the photodetachment is performed using a pulsed laser .",
    "the start time of the free - fall is the photodetachment pulse time .",
    "the stop time corresponds to the annihilation of the @xmath3 on the detection plate .",
    "obviously , reducing the velocity spread of @xmath0 atoms is indispensable for determining @xmath2 with high precision .",
    "the @xmath0 ions are produced in two steps in a collision cell by sending kev antiprotons from the elena ring on a room temperature positronium cloud .",
    "the first step produces antihydrogen atoms and the second one the @xmath0 ions following the reactions : @xmath5 the reaction cross sections have been evaluated by p. comini et al.@xcite , predicting that bunches of a few @xmath0 can be produced using state - of - the - art ps sources . since positronium is much lighter than @xmath6 , the @xmath0 energy distribution is linked to that of the @xmath6 bunch produced by the elena ring@xcite ( whose expected characteristics are 100  kev mean energy and a 4@xmath7  mm  mrad emittance ) .",
    "the @xmath6 bunch is decelerated to an energy of a few kev using a drift tube .",
    "the kinetic energy spread of the @xmath6 bunch and hence of the @xmath0 ion bunch is about 300  ev corresponding to a temperature of 2.3@xmath8  k.    the relative resolution on @xmath2 that can be obtained measuring the free - fall time of a single particle is given by@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the position and velocity dispersions in the vertical direction . in the case of a quantum particle at the heisenberg limit , @xmath10 and @xmath11",

    "an optimum resolution @xmath14 is obtained for @xmath15 leading to @xmath16  2.6  mm / s and @xmath17 assuming @xmath18 and @xmath19  m.    the recoil due to the absorption of the 1.64  @xmath4 m detachment photon is @xmath20  cm / s and may be set in the horizontal plane so that its influence on the free - fall vanishes .",
    "the recoil due to the excess energy can be made small using threshold detachment .",
    "the associated energy is 0.3  m / s under the realistic assumption that the photon energy is 1  @xmath4ev above detachment threshold .",
