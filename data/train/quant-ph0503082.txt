    "entanglement is one of the main features of quantum mechanics .",
    "the most studied example of quantum entanglement is the one of the two spin 1/2 particles as presented by david bohm @xcite : more specifically in the situation where the joint quantum entity of the two spin 1/2 particles is in a singlet spin state .",
    "john bell showed that quantum entanglement can be experimentally tested by means of a set of inequalities , meanwhile called bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "the ` violation of bell s inequalities ' indicates the presence of quantum entanglement . in @xcite",
    "an example of a situation consisting of macroscopic physical entities was proposed where bell s inequalities are violated .",
    "later the example was elaborated to yield a violation with exactly the same value @xmath0 as the one that appears in the violation of bell s inequalities by the spins in the singlet spin state @xcite . in the macroscopic example",
    "the considered entities are two macroscopic particles , and the entanglement is expressed by means of the presence of a rigid rod connecting the two particles .",
    "the rod represents the non - local effect that appears with the violation of bell s inequalities . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that not only the singlet spin state , as considered in @xcite , but all entangled states of coupled spins can be represented by such a rod - like internal constraint .",
    "the quantum probability is obtained in the model because of the introduction of a hidden variable on the measurement apparatus in correspondence with the spin model that was developed in @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic model built in @xcite violates bell s inequalities in a stronger way than the quantum spin example , indeed the violation value for the macroscopic model is 4 while for the quantum example it is @xmath1 .",
    "we have proven in @xcite that the quantum probability present in the case of the quantum spin example , and also in the macroscopic example of @xcite , decreases the violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "this is the reason that a purely classical non - local situation , like the one considered in @xcite , violates bell s inequalities in a stronger way , with maximum possible violation value @xmath2 .",
    "we know that two measurements of which each one is performed on one of the two spins of a quantum entangled spin couple are compatible measurements . indeed ,",
    "self - adjoint operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 representing these measurements commute , which means that the corresponding measurements are compatible .",
    "this means that a situation of quantum entanglement can produce correlations between compatible measurements that violate bell s inequalities .",
    "this is not possible for a situation of classical entanglements .",
    "hence , if classical entanglement is present , at least some of the measurements on the left and on the right will be non - compatible measurements .    in the present article",
    "we investigate the aspect of compatibility and separability as defined in section [ quantumclassicalentanglement ] for situations of classical and quantum entanglement .",
    "we show in section model how increasing indeterminism , hence a change from classical entanglement to quantum - like entanglement , increases compatibility for measurements .",
    "if we want to study compatibility and separability for macroscopic classical entities as well as for quantum entities , we need to introduce a definition that is general enough to capture all these situations .",
    "we do this in the framework of the geneva - brussels approach to operational quantum axiomatics , where the basic notions are the ones of tests , states and properties piron01,piron02,aerts01,aerts02,aerts04,aerts05,piron03,piron04 .",
    "let us consider the situation of a physical entity @xmath5 .",
    "the entity @xmath5 is described by a state space @xmath6 and a set of tests @xmath7 which are defined by dichotomic experiments with outcomes ` yes ' and ` no ' ( see @xcite for the terminology used ) .",
    "we denote @xmath8 the set of possible outcomes for the test @xmath9 , the physical entity being in state @xmath10 obviously the set of possible outcomes of the test @xmath11 is @xmath12 we consider the situation of two physical entities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with state spaces @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and sets of tests @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the two entities @xmath13 and @xmath14 form a compound entity @xmath5 , with state space @xmath19 , and set of tests @xmath20 .",
    "suppose that the compound entity @xmath5 is in state @xmath21 , and consider two tests @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be performed together on the compound entity @xmath5 we denote this joint test @xmath26 .",
    "it will give rise to couples of outcomes @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "let us denote the probability that an experiment @xmath11 yields an outcome @xmath30 for the entity @xmath5 being in the initial state @xmath21 by @xmath31      suppose that one considers an experiment @xmath32 with four possible outcomes , let s call them @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "suppose now that we consider two sub - experiments of this experiment @xmath32 , by identifying some of the outcomes .",
    "hence @xmath24 is the experiment that consists in performing @xmath32 , and giving outcome ` yes ' if we get @xmath35 or @xmath36 for @xmath32 , and ` no ' if we get @xmath37 or @xmath34 for @xmath32 .",
    "the experiment @xmath25 consists in performing @xmath32 , where we give ` yes ' if we get outcomes @xmath35 or @xmath37 and ` no ' if we get outcomes @xmath36 or @xmath34 . since both subexperiments @xmath24 and @xmath25 consist in performing the big experiment @xmath32 , we also perform @xmath24 and @xmath25 together whenever we perform @xmath32 .",
    "let us see how these two sub experiments are related towards each other .",
    "suppose @xmath36 is a possible outcome for @xmath38 hence ` yes , no ' is a possible outcome for experiment @xmath39 then ( by definition ) ` yes ' is possible for @xmath24 and ` no ' is possible for @xmath25 .",
    "this is also the case for the other ` yes ' and ` no ' combinations , which shows that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are compatible as defined in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "hence sub experiments of a big experiment defined in this straightforward way are always compatible experiments .",
    "compatibility expresses the situation where the sub experiments behave as if they could be substituted by one big experiment , after identification of certain outcomes . in terms of probabilities of experiments",
    ", one can express the basis idea of compatibility , namely compatible experiments can be substituted by one big experiment such that they are recovered after identification of certain outcomes , by following conditions :    tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 are ` compatible ' tests with respect to a state @xmath21 iff @xmath40    in case of compatibility , when for example @xmath41 is different from zero , hence ( yes , yes ) is a possible outcome , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 are different from zero ( because probabilities can not be smaller than zero ) , hence ` yes ' is a possible outcome for @xmath24 and ` yes ' is a possible outcome for @xmath25 . grasping the concept of compatibility in probabilistic terms instead of merely ` yes - no ' statements as in @xcite,@xcite allows for a more detailed and realistic classification of the experiments , in the sense that performing real experiments leads to probabilities rather than yes - no statements .",
    "suppose that we start now with two experiments @xmath24 and @xmath44 , such that whatever one does with @xmath24 does not influence what one does with @xmath25 ( the idea of separated of einstein podolsky rosen , @xcite ) , then , just from pure logic , follows that whenever @xmath24 has a possible outcome ` yes ' and for example @xmath25 has a possible outcome ` no ' , then the joint experiments has as possible outcome the couple ` yes , no ' , because there is no influence . that is the basis of separability .",
    "two tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 are called ` separated ' with respect to a state @xmath21 iff @xmath45    two tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 are ` separated ' iff @xmath46 and @xmath25 are separated with respect to @xmath47    this means that if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are possible outcomes for the tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the system @xmath5 in state @xmath50 then also the combined outcome @xmath51 is a possible outcome for the joint test @xmath26 .",
    "suppose that for a specific state the experiment @xmath32 only has two possible outcomes , namely @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then for this state the just constructed experiments @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not separated . indeed if @xmath32 gives the outcome @xmath36 we get ` yes ' for @xmath24 , and if @xmath32 gets the outcome @xmath37 we get ` no ' for @xmath24 , which means that ` yes ' and ` no ' are possible outcomes for @xmath24 . in an analogous way it is easy to see that ` yes ' and ` no ' are possible outcomes for @xmath25 . but",
    "` yes , yes ' is not a possible outcome for @xmath32 , which proves that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not separated . in the example of",
    "` always compatible experiments ' it is clear that these experiments are not necessarily separated , since in this case they are ` always ' executed together , which means that they are highly dependent , and not at all independent .",
    "let us notice that separability implies compatibility .",
    "indeed , putting expressions ( [ sep01]-[sep04 ] ) into ( [ comp01]-[comp04 ] ) one can easily verify that compatibility holds .",
    "a necessary and also sufficient condition for two compatible experiments to be separated is the following : @xmath52 clearly this is a necessary condition for separability , and after some elementary calculations one can verify that it is also a sufficient condition for two compatible experiments to be separated .",
    "a test @xmath9 is called a ` classical test ' iff @xmath53 @xmath54    hence for each state @xmath50 a classical test @xmath11 yields a specific outcome @xmath55 with certainty .",
    "similarly a joint test @xmath26 is classical iff @xmath56 @xmath57    an entity is called a classical entity iff all its tests are classical .",
    "it is not possible to give an example of a classical entity with tests that are compatible but not separated .",
    "this is because for classical entities the two concepts are equivalent .",
    "if @xmath58 are classical tests then @xmath24 and @xmath25 are compatible with respect to a state @xmath50 iff @xmath24 and @xmath25 are separated with respect to this state @xmath50.classicaltheorem    * proof * : suppose @xmath24 and @xmath25 are classical tests that are compatible with respect to state @xmath50 .",
    "suppose ` yes ' is a possible answer for @xmath24 and ` no ' is a possible answer for @xmath25 in state @xmath50 . since both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are classical , these are the only respective outcomes for @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath59 consequently , @xmath60 because of compatibility , @xmath61 such that @xmath62 hence the requirement [ compatibletoseparability ] is satisfied and tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 are separated tests .",
    "@xmath63    hence for classical entities",
    "these concepts coincide , such that compatible classical tests are always separated . also notice that classicality of the joint experiment follows from the compatibility of the classical subtests .",
    "that a joint test constructed from two classical subtests is not necessarily a classical test too , can be seen from following example .",
    "let us consider a slightly modified version of the example given in @xcite .",
    "the entity consists of two vessels connected by a tube and contains 20 liters of transparent water .",
    "tests @xmath64 on the left , respectively right vessel are defined by taking a siphon and collecting water in a reference vessel .",
    "if we consider the test @xmath64 defined as ` can we take more than 10 liters of water from the vessel @xmath65 ' then test @xmath24 performed on the left vessel yields ` yes ' with certainty .",
    "if on the other hand we would chose to perform the test @xmath66 on the right vessel then we would obtain ` yes ' with certainty .",
    "if we define the joint test @xmath67 by performing both tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 at the same time , we can never find the answer ( ` yes',`yes ' ) showing that tests @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not compatible and hence not separated .",
    "an example of a joint test of two classical subtests which is not classical can be constructed as follows .",
    "let us consider the test @xmath68 on the right vessel , defined as follows : ` take a random amount of water ( between 0,5 and 19,5 liter ) out the right vessel with the fastest siphon in the universe and see whether the water is transparent or not ' .",
    "because of the initial assumption that the vessels are filled with transparent water , @xmath68 always yields the answer ` yes ' . again , if we would perform test @xmath24 we find the answer ` yes ' with certainty such that @xmath69 on the other hand , if the joint test @xmath70 is performed by making both tests at the same time , then in some cases we obtain the outcome @xmath71 in the case the random amount of water collected by test @xmath68 is less than 10 liters of water , and @xmath72 in the other case since test @xmath68 uses the fastest siphon and collects all the water it needs to check for transparency before test @xmath24 is able to collect more than 10 liters of water . hence the joint test is not classical , since @xmath73 also , tests @xmath24 and @xmath68 are not compatible , since @xmath74 such that @xmath75 this example shows that compatibility of classical tests is a very powerful condition , since it not only implies separability of the two tests , but also classicality of the joint test .    for the example of the connected vessels of water",
    "it is clear that the considered tests can not be separated because of the clear physical connection between the two vessels . for entangled quantum systems we encounter non - separated tests in a natural way (",
    "actually it is not possible to describe a compound system of two separated quantum systems within the formalism of quantum theoryaerts01,aerts02,aerts04,aertsvalckenborgh01,aertsvalckenborgh02,aertsvalckenborgh03 ) , but the origin of this quantum non - separability is still a matter of debate for physicists and philosophers alike . to shed more light on this issue , we discuss in the next section a macroscopic model of a compound system of two entangled spin 1/2 in the singlet state , in which tests are defined by a parameter reflecting randomness in the measurement such that we obtain a continuous transition from a quantum system to a classical system , and check what happens with separability and compatibility for these systems .",
    "for the individual spin 1/2 entities of the coupled spin 1/2 entity we use a sphere model representation developed within the hidden measurement approach to quantum mechanics aerts06,aerts07,aerts08,aerts09,aertsaerts01,aertsetal02 , which is a generalization of the poincar or bloch representation , such that also the measurements as well as a parameter for non - determinism are described @xcite .    in this model , a spin 1/2 entity",
    "is represented by a point particle on the surface of a 3-dimensional unit sphere , called poincar sphere , such that its state @xmath76 is represented by the point @xmath77 .",
    "all points of the poincar sphere represent states of the spin , such that points @xmath78 on the surface correspond to pure states , while interior points @xmath79 correspond to density states @xmath80 @xmath81 in this expression @xmath82 is the usual density state representation of a pure state , while @xmath83 is the density matrix representing the center of the sphere .     and @xmath84 , which are three states in the spin direction @xmath85 , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which are three states in the spin direction @xmath88 .",

    "we introduce a test @xmath92 that is the following .",
    "we put a piece of elastic of length @xmath93 in the middle of the sphere and connect it with ` unbreakable ' cords with the point @xmath78 on the surface of the sphere and its diametrically opposite point @xmath94 ( fig .",

    "suppose that the spin is in a state represented by the point @xmath95 .",
    "once the elastic is placed , the point particle falls orthogonally from its place @xmath95 onto the elastic , and stays stuck to it in the point @xmath96 .",
    "then the piece of elastic breaks with uniform probability .",
    "if the elastic breaks in the interval @xmath97 the elastic pulls the particle to the point @xmath78 where it stays and the test @xmath98 yields answer ` yes ' . if on the other hand the elastic breaks in the interval @xmath99 the particle ends up in @xmath94 and the test @xmath98 yields the answer ` no ' .     and",
    "@xmath100 is a connection consisting of an elastic of length @xmath101 around @xmath102 , and an unbreakable cord for the rest .",
    "the point particle in @xmath103 falls orthogonally on this connection .",
    "then the elastic breaks at random uniformly , and one of the two pieces of the connection drags the point particle to one of the two points @xmath84 or @xmath100 , respectively with probabilities that are the quantum spin 1/2 transition probabilities . , width=188 ]    if the elastic breaks exactly in the point @xmath104 we make the hypothesis that the test @xmath98 yields the outcome ` yes ' . if @xmath105 it can be proven that the sphere model reduces to a model for the spin measurements on a spin 1/2 particle , since the probabilities of the outcome ` yes ' ( respectively ` no ' ) for the test @xmath106 coincide with the quantum probabilities for a spin measurement with a stern - gerlach apparatus along the @xmath91-direction ( fig .",

    "if @xmath107 , the model reduces to a classical model : all tests @xmath108 are classical , in the sense of definition [ defclassical ] .",
    "remark that in this classical limit ( @xmath107 ) still a state transition occurs , but from the probabilistic point of view measurements behave classical ( i.e. deterministic ) .",
    "for @xmath109 we find a situation in between quantum and classical aertsetal06,aertsdurt01,aertsdurt02,aertsetal04,aertsetal05 .",
    "assuming uniform distribution of where the elastic breaks , probabilities are given by @xmath110for @xmath111 @xmath112 for @xmath113 @xmath114 for @xmath115    the connected vessels of water entity is already an example of a macroscopic system which violate bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , the expectation values it attains violate bell s inequalities more than possible for any quantum system of two entangled spin 1/2 . in a way",
    ", this follows from the fact that the connected vessels of water entity behaves ` too deterministic ' : if we allow indeterminism in the tests one can obtain expectation values which still violate bell s inequalities but within the bounds of quantum probability @xcite . in effect , in aerts09 a macroscopic system was considered which violates bell s inequalities in exactly the same way as a quantum system of two entangled spin 1/2 in the singlet state .",
    "the model consists of two sphere models , such that the point particles are connected by a rigid but extendable rod ( fig .",
    "[ macroentangledspins ] ) .",
    "the singlet state is represented by the two point particles being in the center of the respective poincar sphere , which corresponds with a density state of the sphere model .",
    "a joint test @xmath67 on the compound system is defined by performing first the test @xmath24 and next the test @xmath25 as follows .",
    "first let us consider the quantum case with @xmath116 and show that the model indeed is a model for the singlet state .",
    "when the first test @xmath117 is performed , one of the two possible outcomes occurs with probability 1/2 since the point particle is in the middle of the sphere and the elastic pulls the left point particle to the corresponding eigenstate . however , because of the rod between the two particles , the other particle which initially was in the center of the right sphere is drawn towards a point on the surface of the sphere , namely the point diametrically opposite to the eigenstate of the observed outcome of the first test .",
    "only then the second test is performed on the point particle , following the same description as for a single sphere model .",
    "when the frequency of the coincidence counts is calculated it turns out to be in exact accordance with the quantum mechanical prediction for the spin measurements on a quantum system of two entangled spin 1/2 in the singlet state @xcite .",
    "actually , because of symmetry in the initial singlet state it does not matter which test is performed first ( left or right ) , since the results ( i.e. probabilistic distribution over the set of outcomes and the corresponding final states ) are the same .",
    "there are two key ingredients of this model that seem particularly important in order to make it a model for the singlet state .",
    "first we have the rigid rod , which shows the non - separable wholeness of the singlet coincidence measurement ( cfr .",
    "the role of the connecting tube between the vessels of water ) and which reflects the role of non - locality in quantum theory .",
    "secondly , we have the elastic that breaks which gives rise to the probabilistic nature ( cfr . the role of the siphon in the vessels of water ) of the outcomes which reflects the intrinsic indeterminism in quantum experiments . together these features establish the meaning of the violation of bell s inequalities as the ` non - existence of local realism ' .",
    "let us now explore the role of indeterminism for the concepts of separability and compatibility by introducing the parameter @xmath118 for the compound system in the singlet state in an analogous way as for a single spin 1/2 model ( fig [ macroentangledspins ] ) .",
    "we analyze for different values of the parameter @xmath118 which tests are compatible or separated .",
    "consider the case @xmath116 , which means that our model becomes a quantum model for two coupled spin 1/2 in the singlet spin state .",
    "consider the tests @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , hence the case of two aligned spin directions .",
    "then the coupled sphere models are compatible but not separable : while for each test @xmath24 and @xmath25 the result ` yes ' or ` no ' is possible ( with probability 1/2 ) , the joint test @xmath123 only has possible outcomes ( ` yes',`no ' ) or ( ` no',`yes ' ) for the compound system in the singlet state , each with probability 1/2 .",
    "hence @xmath124 and the two tests are compatible but not separable : @xmath125 the same situation occurs if we consider the tests @xmath119 and @xmath126 , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( i.e. @xmath129 and @xmath130 are opposite directions ) : for both tests the result ` yes ' or ` no ' are possible outcomes ( with probability 1/2 ) , while the joint test only has possible outcomes ( ` yes',`yes ' ) or ( ` no',`no ' ) for the compound system in the singlet state .",
    "hence also these tests are compatible but not separable .",
    "we remark that if we consider tests @xmath119 and @xmath126 along different measurement directions @xmath131 and @xmath132 , we find that these tests are always compatible:@xmath133but that they are only separable if @xmath134 in which case the second measurement yields the same probability distribution after performing the first experiment as for a single measurement , and it is as if the subtests could be performed independently of each other .",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath109 and determine which tests are compatible , respectively separable .",
    "let us first notice that for the system prepared in the singlet state we have @xmath135 following the description of the compound tests @xmath136 for the system prepared in the singlet state , the point particle in the second sphere will be pulled by means of the rod to the point @xmath137 on the sphere in the event of an answer ` yes ' in the first test , and to the point @xmath138 in the event of an outcome ` no ' . hence if in the first subtest of the joint experiment @xmath139 the outcome ` yes ' was found , then outcome ` yes ' occurs in the second measurement with probability @xmath140if @xmath141 , such that @xmath142 if @xmath143 we obtain @xmath144 and if @xmath145 then @xmath146 similarly , we find for @xmath147@xmath148clearly , the two experiments @xmath149 and @xmath150 are always compatible but only separated if @xmath151 i.e. @xmath152    finally , let us see what happens in the classical situation @xmath107 for @xmath153 .",
    "the first test @xmath154 is deterministic since it yields answer ` yes ' with certainty , such that the second particle is pulled towards the state @xmath155 . if @xmath156 the second test @xmath157 yields answer ` no ' with certainty . if @xmath158 the second test will yield the outcome ` yes ' with certainty . hence depending on the angle between the measurement directions @xmath159 and @xmath160 we obtain that the set of possible outcomes for the joint test @xmath161 if @xmath162 and @xmath163 if @xmath164 since for @xmath107 both test @xmath165 and @xmath166 yield positive outcome with certainty : @xmath167 , we can conclude that for @xmath158 the two tests are compatible , and from theorem [ classicaltheorem ] ( or simple verification ) follows that they are also separable .",
    "for @xmath168 we have @xmath169 . hence tests along these directions",
    "are neither compatible nor separable , which is in agreement with theorem [ classicaltheorem ] which states that for classical tests the concepts of compatibility and separability coincide .",
    "we have studied a macroscopic model for the singlet state of a quantum system of two spin 1/2 consisting of two sphere models connected by a rigid but extendable rod . by considering a parameter representing indeterminism in the measurement procedure ,",
    "we have described a continuous transition from a quantum to a classical system and shown which tests are compatible or separable .",
    "we have proven that for classical , i.e. deterministic , systems the concepts of separability and compatibility coincide , and that the joint test of two compatible classical subtests is classical . as an illustration we considered an example of a nonclassical joint test of two classical but noncompatible subtests . for the compound system in the quantum limit tests along non orthogonal measurement directions",
    "are always compatible but not separable .",
    "therefore , these tests and a fortiori the subsystems are not separated , which is in agreement with previous results stating that separated quantum entities can not be described in quantum theory aerts01,aerts02,aerts04,aertsvalckenborgh01,aertsvalckenborgh02,aertsvalckenborgh03 . for intermediate values of the parameter we found that all tests are compatible , but they are only separable if @xmath152 in the classical limit @xmath107 tests @xmath170 and @xmath166 are compatible and therefore also separable if @xmath158 . in these cases ,",
    "the two subsystems behave as if they are really separated and their is no rigid rod connecting the two point particles .",

    "<S> we study the concepts of compatibility and separability and their implications for quantum and classical systems . </S>",
    "<S> these concepts are illustrated on a macroscopic model for the singlet state of a quantum system of two entangled spin 1/2 with a parameter reflecting indeterminism in the measurement procedure . by varying this parameter </S>",
    "<S> we describe situations from quantum , intermediate to classical and study which tests are compatible or separated . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that for classical deterministic systems the concepts of separability and compatibility coincide , but for quantum systems and intermediate systems these concepts are generally different . </S>"
