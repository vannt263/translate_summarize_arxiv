    "the _ johnson  mehl tessellation _ of @xmath1 may be described as follows : particles ( nucleation centres ) arrive at certain times according to a spatial ( deterministic or random ) birth process on @xmath1 .",
    "when a particle arrives , it starts to grow a ` crystal ' at a constant rate in all directions .",
    "crystals grow only through ` vacant ' space not yet occupied by other crystals ; they stop growing when they run into each other .",
    "also , a new particle that arrives inside an existing crystal never forms a crystal at all .",
    "this generates a covering of @xmath1 by crystals meeting only in their boundaries : every point of @xmath1 belongs to the crystal that first reached it , or to the boundaries of two or more such crystals if it is reached simultaneously by several crystals .",
    "these tessellations were introduced by johnson and mehl @xcite in 1939 as spatial models for the growth of crystals in metallic systems .",
    "the same growth model ( but not the resulting tessellation ) had been considered earlier by kolmogorov  @xcite ; similar models were introduced independently by avrami @xcite , @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , these models go under a variety of names ( see the references ) : in mathematics , they tend to be called _ johnson  mehl tessellations _ , so this is the term we shall use here .",
    "these models have been used to analyze a great variety of problems from phase transition kinetics to polymers , ecological systems and dna replication ( see evans @xcite , fanfoni and tomellini @xcite , @xcite , ramos , rikvold and novotny @xcite , tomellini , fanfoni and volpe @xcite , @xcite , and pacchiarotti , fanfoni and tomellini @xcite , to mention only a handful of papers ) ; mathematical properties of these tessellations have been studied by gilbert  @xcite , miles  @xcite , mller  @xcite , chiu and quine  @xcite , and penrose  @xcite , among others .",
    "if all particles arrive at the same time then we get a _ voronoi tessellation _ ; this was introduced into crystallography by meijering @xcite in 1953 , although it had been studied much earlier by delesse @xcite , dirichlet @xcite and voronoi @xcite , in whose honour it is named .",
    "random voronoi tessellations have been studied in numerous papers : for a list of references , see @xcite ; here , we shall make heavy use of the results in @xcite . for a discussion of many aspects of voronoi and related tessellations , including random voronoi tessellations and johnson  mehl tessellations ,",
    "see the book by okabe , boots , sugihara and chiu  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in _ random johnson ",
    "mehl tessellations of the plane_. as in almost all probabilistic models in the literature , we shall assume that the birth process is a time - homogeneous poisson process of constant intensity , say , intensity 1 .",
    "thus , our particles arrive randomly on the plane at random times @xmath2 , according to a homogeneous poisson process @xmath3 on @xmath4 .",
    "for each particle arriving at position @xmath5 and time @xmath2 we have a point @xmath6 .",
    "the crystal associated to @xmath7 reaches a point @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes euclidean distance .",
    "( the subscript in the notation refers to the power in the norm , not to the dimension : we shall write @xmath11 for the metric on @xmath1 associated to the @xmath12-norm . )",
    "let @xmath13 denote the norm on @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 and let @xmath16 denote the corresponding distance . then the crystal @xmath17 associated to @xmath18 may be written as @xmath19 a portion of a johnson ",
    "mehl tessellation is shown in figure  [ fig_jm ] .",
    "@xmath20    in this way we see that the johnson ",
    "mehl tessellation of @xmath21 corresponds to a two - dimensional slice of the voronoi tessellation of @xmath14 defined with respect to a slightly unusual metric , @xmath22 ; only the absolute values of the time coordinates appear in , so up to rescaling ( changing the density by a factor of two ) , it makes no difference whether we take the particles to form a poisson process on @xmath14 or on @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to studying johnson ",
    "mehl tessellations , we shall also study two - dimensional slices of the usual random voronoi tessellation of @xmath14 : the cells are defined exactly as in , but using the usual euclidean metric @xmath10 on @xmath14 . in fact , much of what we shall say will apply to more general norms on @xmath14 ; however , the tessellation of @xmath21 associated to a general norm on @xmath14 is a rather unnatural object . indeed , for a general norm , the cells @xmath23 need not even be connected , and the associated graph @xmath24 defined below need",
    "not be planar .",
    "for this reason , we shall focus our attention on tessellations associated to @xmath13 and to the euclidean norm .",
    "another example we shall consider is the norm @xmath25 on @xmath14 , which may be viewed as @xmath26 on @xmath27 ; the associated tessellation of @xmath21 is a johnson  mehl type tessellation in which crystals grow as squares whose side - lengths increase at a constant rate .    as our main focus will be the johnson ",
    "mehl tessellation , we shall always take @xmath3 to be a poisson process on @xmath28 , rather than on @xmath14 , noting that the only effect on the resulting tessellation of @xmath21 is a rescaling .",
    "having defined the cells @xmath17 associated to the points @xmath29 of a poisson process @xmath3 , there is a natural way to construct an associated graph @xmath30 : the vertex set may be taken either to be the set of @xmath31 for which @xmath32 , or all of @xmath3 ( in which case vertices corresponding to empty cells will be isolated ) .",
    "two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding cells meet , i.e. , share one or more boundary points . ignoring probability zero events , as we may , two vertices",
    "are adjacent if and only if their cells have a common boundary arc .",
    "( two cells may share more than one boundary arc ; there is an example in figure  [ fig_jm ] . )",
    "our aim is to study site percolation on the random graph @xmath30 , or , equivalently , ` face percolation ' on the tessellation @xmath33 itself .",
    "let @xmath34 be a parameter .",
    "we assign a _ state _",
    ", _ open _ or _ closed _ , to each vertex of @xmath30 , so that , given @xmath3 , the states of the vertices are independent , and each is open with probability @xmath35 .",
    "we are interested in the question ` for which @xmath35 does @xmath30 contain an infinite connected subgraph all of whose vertices are open ? ' .",
    "equivalently , we may colour the cells @xmath17 of the tessellation independently , taking each cell to be black with probability @xmath35 and white otherwise , and we ask for which @xmath35 there is an unbounded _ black component_. we shall switch freely between these two viewpoints , writing @xmath36 for the ( common ) associated probability measure .",
    "let us say that a point @xmath8 is _ black _ if it lies in a black cell , and _ white _ if it lies in a white cell .",
    "note that a point may be both black and white , if it lies in the boundary of two cells .",
    "let @xmath37 be the set of points of @xmath21 joined to the origin by a _ black path _",
    ", i.e. , a topological path in @xmath21 every point of which is black .",
    "let @xmath38 be the a.s .",
    "unique point of @xmath3 in whose cell the origin lies , and let @xmath39 be the _ open cluster _ of @xmath24 containing @xmath38 , i.e. , the set of all vertices of @xmath24 joined to @xmath38 by a path in the graph @xmath24 in which every vertex is open . since the cells @xmath17 are connected ( see section  [ sec_basics ] )",
    ", the set @xmath40 is precisely the union of the @xmath17 for @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 and let @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the expectation corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "note that the graph @xmath30 depends on the metric @xmath45 as well as on @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on @xmath45 ; most of the time , we suppress this dependence .",
    "we say that our coloured random tessellation _ percolates _ if @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to see ( from kolmogorov s @xmath49-@xmath50 law , say ) that , in this case , the tessellation a.s . contains an unbounded black component , while",
    "if @xmath51 , then a.s .",
    "there is none .",
    "we write @xmath52 for the hammersley critical probability associated to percolation on our random tessellation , and @xmath53 for the corresponding temperley critical probability .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to determine the critical probabilities for the johnson ",
    "mehl tessellation and for a two - dimensional slice of the three - dimensional voronoi tessellation .",
    "the corresponding task for the random voronoi tessellation associated to a homogeneous poisson process on @xmath21 was accomplished recently in @xcite , where it was proved that @xmath54 .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath45 denote either @xmath22 or @xmath10 , let @xmath3 be a homogeneous poisson process on @xmath55 or on @xmath14 , and let @xmath24 be the graph associated to the tessellation @xmath33 of @xmath21 defined by",
    ". then @xmath56 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath48 if and only if @xmath57 and , for every @xmath58 , there is a constant @xmath59 such that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the area of @xmath37 , the diameter of @xmath37 , or the number @xmath63 of cells in @xmath37 .",
    "the proof of the corresponding result for voronoi tessellations in  @xcite is rather lengthy .",
    "much of this proof adapts easily to the johnson ",
    "mehl setting , including , for example , the analogue of the russo  seymour  welsh lemma .",
    "however , the hardest part of the proof , a certain technical lemma , theorem 6.1 in  @xcite , does not .",
    "this result asserts that one can approximate the continuous poisson process @xmath3 by a suitable discrete process ; the proof of this extremely unsurprising statement makes up a significant fraction of the length of  @xcite .",
    "the analogue of this result for the johnson  mehl model is theorem  [ th_couplerobust ] below ; because the arguments depend on the details of the geometry , a fresh proof is required here .",
    "surprisingly , although the johnson  mehl model is more complicated that the voronoi model , the proof turns out to be simpler , though still not short .",
    "the key difference is that we can use the third dimension of the model to our advantage .    in the next section",
    "we describe basic properties of the johnson  mehl model . in section",
    "[ sec_red ] we outline the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] , assuming theorem  [ th_couplerobust ] ; this part of the paper consists of a straightforward adaptation of arguments from  @xcite .",
    "the heart of the present paper is section  [ sec_heart ] , where we prove the technical approximation lemma for the johnson  mehl model . in the final section",
    "we discuss some generalizations .",
    "the probability that some point of the plane is equidistant from four points of @xmath3 is zero .",
    "hence , with probability @xmath50 , at most three cells @xmath17 of the tessellation associated to @xmath3 meet at any point .",
    "we shall always assume that @xmath3 has this property .",
    "similarly , given any measure zero set @xmath64 ( for example , the boundary of a fixed rectangle ) , we may assume that no point of @xmath64 lies in three cells .",
    "also , as any ball in @xmath14 contains only finitely many points of @xmath3 ( a.s . or always , depending on the definition of a poisson process one chooses ) , we shall assume that every disk in @xmath21 meets finitely many cells @xmath17 .    if we take our metric @xmath45 to be the euclidean metric @xmath10 or the @xmath25-metric @xmath65 ( and take @xmath3 to be a poisson process on @xmath14 ) , then the cells @xmath17 are two - dimensional sections of ( bounded ) convex sets ( in fact polyhedra ) in @xmath14 , and hence convex . for @xmath16",
    "this is not true , but the cell @xmath17 associated to a point @xmath6 is still a star domain , with centre @xmath66 :    if @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a point on the line segment @xmath69 , as in figure  [ fig_star ] , then we have @xmath70 while for any @xmath71 , @xmath72 by the triangle inequality . since @xmath73 for all @xmath74 , the same inequality for @xmath68 follows , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath17 is a star domain , and in particular @xmath17 is connected .",
    "of course , the same argument applies to any metric @xmath45 on @xmath76 that is the direct sum of a metric on @xmath21 and one on @xmath77 .    rather than first constructing a poisson process @xmath3 on @xmath55 , and then colouring the points of @xmath3 black with probability @xmath35 and white with probability @xmath78 , equivalently",
    "we may start with two independent poisson processes @xmath79 , @xmath80 with intensities @xmath35 and @xmath81 , corresponding to the black and white points , respectively .",
    "this is the viewpoint we shall adopt most of the time .    in this viewpoint ,",
    "our state space @xmath82 consists of all pairs @xmath83 of discrete subsets of @xmath4 .",

'",

    "this random colouring has the following properties : firstly , the event that any point ( or given set of points ) is black is a black - increasing event , so any two such events are positively correlated .",
    "secondly , the distribution of the random colouring is invariant under the symmetries of @xmath135 , i.e. , under translations ( by integer or in fact arbitrary vectors ) , under reflections in the axes , and under rotations through multiples of @xmath127 .",
