    "it is now widely accepted that most normal galaxies have central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with @xmath10 ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "high resolution observations of nearby galaxies have revealed a close correlation between the mass of smbhs and the bulge mass , or the velocity dispersion of the bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the formation of smbhs is strongly coupled with the formation of galaxies .",
    "however , the formation and evolution of smbhs is still an open question and a hot topic in astrophysics .",
    "the discovery of luminous quasars at redshift @xmath11 shows that smbhs of the order of billions of solar masses exist at the end of the re - ionization epoch ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "considering eddington - limited accretion , @xmath12 quasars may not form readily . unless the seed black hole mass is large , gas accretion with low radiative efficiency and/or bh mergers significantly contribute to the growth of smbhs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if super - eddington accretion is possible , the growth timescale of bhs can be much shorter than the eddington timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , super - eddington accretion might explain the formation of smbhs .",
    "recently , @xcite predicted that super - eddington accretion is required for the formation of @xmath13 quasars with @xmath14 , because the final bh mass is greatly suppressed by star formation in a circumnuclear disc and agn outflow based on the coevolution model of smbh growth and a circumnuclear disc ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the occurrence of super - eddington accretion flow has not yet been accurately verified , although this issue has been investigated since the 1970s ( e.g. , @xcite . by using two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", @xcite demonstrated for the fist time that quasi - steady super - eddington disc accretion is possible , because both the radiation field and the mass accretion flow around a bh are non - spherical and the large number of photons generated in the disc is swallowed by the bh without being radiated away due to photon - trapping ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion has recently been confirmed by two - dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether super - eddington accretion can significantly contribute to the formation of smbhs , because the radiation pressure and/or disc wind associated with super - eddington accretion might play an important role in the gas accretion process in host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the local universe",
    ", we have discovered a class of agns with a higher eddington ratio among the agn population , i.e. , narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "they have characteristic properties such as narrow balmer lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , strong soft x - ray excess ( e.g. , @xcite ) and rapid variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these properties indicate that they have a small black hole mass and high eddington ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed bolometric luminosity of nls1s saturates at a few times the eddington luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is consistent with predictions of the super - eddington accretion disc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the star formation rate of nls1 hosts is higher than that of bls1s ( @xcite ) . thus , nls1s may be the early phase of rapid bh growth via super - eddington accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the high-@xmath15 universe , we may speculate that super - eddington agns are a more dominant population of agns because the lifetime of smbh growth is closer to the cosmic age if the formation of smbhs is mainly a gas accretion process . to confirm this ,",
    "it is important to determine whether the fraction of super - eddington agns increases with redshift . some observations to date have indicated that the average eddington ratio increases slightly with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , we have not observed super - eddington agns among high-@xmath15 quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and agns in high-@xmath15 massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is essential to find candidate super - eddington agns before starting detailed observations .    according to unification models of agns ,",
    "the accretion disc is surrounded by a dusty structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a significant fraction of the emitted ultraviolet and optical radiation of the accretion disc is absorbed by the dust and is re - emitted at ir wavelengths .",
    "in particular , the hot dust is directly heated by the central engine and produces near - ir ( nir ) emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since it has been reported that the polar angle dependence of the radiation flux for super - eddington accretion flow deviates from that for sub - eddington flow ( e.g. , @xcite hereafter w05 ) , the reprocessed ir emission may be useful for exploring candidates of super - eddington accretion flow in agns . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of ir ( as well as nir ) emission from the inner edge of the dusty torus , employing radiative flux from the disc accretion flows by w05 , in which the radiation fluxes of sub- and super - eddington accretion discs are given as functions of the polar angle and the mass accretion rate .",
    "we briefly summarize the relation between the radiation flux from the accretion disc and the mass accretion rate into an smbh .",
    "for a small mass accretion rate , i.e. , @xmath16@xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass accretion rate into an smbh and the eddington luminosity , respectively , if the accretion disc is geometrically thin , it is known as a standard disc @xcite . as the mass accretion rate increases ( @xmath20 ) ,",

    "although x - ray observations have shown the radiation from the disc to be comptonized at the corona above the disc , the size and geometries of the corona are still open questions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the optical thickness of the corona is thought to be around unity or less in the case of sub - eddington discs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath24-dependence of the radiative flux should not change much .",
    "global radiation hydrodynamic simulations of super - eddington flows have revealed that the radiative flux is highly collimated , although hot rarefied plasma ( corona ) appears above the disc @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) into eq . ( 4 ) , the ratio of the agn ir luminosity and the bolometric luminosity is obtained as follows :    for @xmath42 , @xmath43    for @xmath44 , @xmath45 these relations are understood in terms of the projection effect , self - occultation and the covering factor of the dusty torus . for @xmath23@xmath17",

    "the radiation flux is more sensitive to the polar angle in super - eddington accretion discs with @xmath48 than in sub - eddington accretion discs via the self- occultation effect ( see eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) .",

    "super - eddington agns with @xmath26 have much smaller ratios of the ir and bolometric luminosities than sub - eddington agns .",
    "although the ratios of @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath50 are only a few times smaller than that for @xmath57@xmath17 in the case of @xmath58 , they are one or two orders of magnitude lower than that for @xmath59 in a wide range of half opening angle , @xmath7 .",

    "super - eddington accretion ( @xmath26 ) with a thin torus ( top right panel ) has the smallest @xmath55 in the four panels of fig . 3 due to the self - occultation effect of the disc along with the small covering factor of the torus .     on the mass accretion rate into an smbh and the geometry of the dusty torus .",

    ", height=245 ]    we here mention the effect of the inclination angle , @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the observed ratio @xmath69 depends on @xmath39 , but @xmath70 is independent of @xmath39 , where @xmath71 is the observed disc luminosity at the viewing angle of @xmath39 . however , the difference between @xmath72 ( face on ) and @xmath39=30@xmath73 is a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of 45 deg @xmath75 , the dependence of @xmath39 on @xmath76 is sensitive to @xmath29 .",
    "for example , the difference between @xmath39=0@xmath73 ( face on ) and @xmath39=60 @xmath73 is a factor of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath23@xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "thus , when @xmath81 deg , the ir luminosity of super - eddington agns could be similar to that of sub - eddington agns .    in summary ,",
    "the ir luminosity of super - eddington agns is very faint for @xmath82 , while it is not so faint for 45@xmath83 .",
    "therefore , in order to examine the candidate super - eddington agns effectively by ir observations , it is worth constructing samples of pure type 1 agns ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) rather than type 1.5 and 1.8 agns .    in this paper , we assume that the dusty torus is aligned with the accretion disc , such as in fig .",
    "however , this is not a trivial assumption because it is unclear whether the dusty torus is a reservoir of the gas which accretes onto the accretion disc .",
    "if the accretion disc is misaligned with the dusty torus , the self - occultation effect becomes less important as the angle between the rotation axis of the accretion disc and that of the torus increases ( see eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) , since a large number of photons from the accretion disc are absorbed and re - emitted at the dusty torus .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath55 for super - eddington agns would be comparable to that for sub - eddington agns .",
    "lastly , we note the relation between the agn type and @xmath2 . it may be questioned whether our method is worthwhile if the agn types are mainly determined by @xmath2 and @xmath84 is a standard torus model for all types of agn .",
    "however , recent observations on circum - nuclear regions of agns have revealed that type 2 seyferts are more frequently associated with starbursts than type 1 seyferts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the fraction of type 2 agns decreases with agn luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these findings imply that the type1/type2 ratio is not simply determined by the opening angle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "moreover , the formation mechanism of the obscuring torus is still a hotly debated issue theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , even if the effect we proposed becomes significant only for relatively large @xmath2 ( @xmath85 ) , our method is useful for exploring the candidates of super - eddington agns .",
    "near - ir ( nir ) emission is produced by the hot dust ( @xmath86 ) which is directly heated by the central agns , though the total ir emission may be contaminated by the nuclear starburst .",
    "thus , based on the results of fig .",
    "2 , we investigate the dependence of the ratio @xmath6 on the mass accretion rate , @xmath29 .",
    "the nir luminosity , @xmath87 , strongly depends on the shape of the inner edge of the torus , because the hot dust temperature , @xmath88 , is sensitive to the structure of the torus .",
    "we here consider the following three typical models for the structure of the inner edge of the torus ( see fig .",
    "first , we examine the case where the inner radius of the torus @xmath89 is determined by the sublimation radius @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "4(i ) ) . here",
    "@xmath90 is defined as the radius where the hot dust temperature is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the silicate grain sublimation temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , the sublimation radius could be elongated to extend to the central bh in the equatorial plane ( see @xcite ) , since the dust in the equatorial plane can survive because @xmath93 .",
    "since such dust particles at @xmath94 can be heated to @xmath951500 k due to illumination and emit nir ( see fig . 4 ( i ) ) , the nir luminosity is equal to the ir luminosity , i.e. , @xmath96 for all @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we can just replace @xmath97 assigned at the vertical axis in fig .",
    "2 . with @xmath98 .    second , we consider the case where the nir emission comes from only a small part of the inner edge ( fig .",
    "4(ii ) ) . in this case",
    ", we define the nir luminosity ( @xmath99 ) as the luminosity emitted by the hot dust ( @xmath100@xmath101 ) .",
    "the nir luminosity is obtained as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is defined as @xmath104 , as seen in fig .",
    "the contribution of nir emission decreases as the mass accretion rate is high , because for a large @xmath29 the hot region at the inner edge of the torus ( the red shaded region in fig .",
    "4(ii ) ) becomes smaller due to self - occultation of the super - eddington accretion flow . as a result",
    ", we find that for a given @xmath2 , the ratio @xmath105 for super - eddington agns with @xmath67 is much smaller than that for sub - eddington agns with @xmath23@xmath17 , as shown in table 1 .",
    "third , we consider the case where the dust temperature of the whole inner edge of the torus becomes lower than @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "4(iii ) ) .",
    "if this is the case , it is expected that there will be no nir emission from the dusty torus for both sub- and super - eddington agns .",
    "however , this prediction is in conflict with nir observations of sub - eddington agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , only for nir - faint agns , the dust temperature at @xmath89 might be below the dust sublimation temperature , because the inner radius is larger than the expected sublimation radius . to investigate this possibility , for nir - faint agns ,",
    "it is important to evaluate the time lag between the uv and nir light by photometric monitoring observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath2 and @xmath29 +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking into account the above results , we can conclude that a relatively low @xmath6 , as well as @xmath107 , is a sign of super - eddington agns with @xmath67 , unless the half opening angle of the torus is small ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we can also confirm that the predicted @xmath6 with @xmath23@xmath17 ( fig .",
    "2 , see also table 1 ) almost coincides with the observed results of sub - eddington quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , assuming @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the agn luminosity at @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the evaporation of nearby dusty clouds irradiated by agns . in the steady state for a dusty torus , cloud evaporation at the inner radius of the torus should balance the mass supply of the clouds from the outer region ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the evaporation timescale , @xmath112 , is longer than the orbital period of a cloud around smbhs , @xmath113 , the inner radius is determined by the sublimation radius , @xmath114 . on the other hand , when @xmath115 , the evaporation could be determined by the location of the inner edge of the torus .",
    "thus , the inner radius of the dusty torus becomes larger than the sublimation radius .",
    "if this is the case , the nir luminosity could be overestimated because the dust temperature is lower .",
    "to check this , we estimate the two timescales ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) for the present model . assuming @xmath116 , the orbital period of a cloud at @xmath114 is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the rotational velocity and @xmath119 . following @xcite , for a cloud of mass @xmath120 and @xmath121 ,",
    "the evaporation timescale is given by @xmath122 note that @xmath123 at @xmath114 is @xmath124 ( eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) ) .",
    "comparing these two timescales , we find @xmath125 for sub - eddington agns with @xmath68(see @xcite in details ) . on the other hand , for super - eddington agns with @xmath126 and @xmath127 ,",
    "the evaporation timescale is comparable to the orbital period of a cloud , i.e. , @xmath128 ( see eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8) )",
    ". if this is the case , evaporation of a dusty cloud would be fast enough to reduce the overall nir emission .",
    "therefore , agns with high @xmath129 and @xmath29 , such as bright narrow - line quasars , might have a much smaller ratio @xmath130 , compared to the results of fig .",
    "so far , we have not taken into account the ir emission from narrow - line region ( nlr ) clouds .",
    "however , it is known that dust grains are present in the nlr of seyferts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the dusty clouds in the nlr might be a source of ir emission and hence we must consider the contribution of ir emission from nlr clouds .",
    "nlr clouds are assumed to be distributed in a geometrically thin spherical shell with radius @xmath131 in the range @xmath132 . assuming the covering factor of the nlr clouds , @xmath133 , and the optical depth of the nlr clouds , @xmath134 , the ir luminosity from nlr clouds can be given by @xmath135 where @xmath55 is a function of @xmath2 ( see eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) . in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the ratio of the ir luminosity to the bolometric luminosity against @xmath2 for the nlr clouds , assuming @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "note that the dust extinction of nlr emission is small ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) for type 1 agns @xcite and the typical covering factor is about @xmath139 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    figure 4 shows that the ir emission from the nlr clouds dominates above @xmath140 for @xmath52 , while for @xmath53 and @xmath54 the ir emission from nlr clouds is important above @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that for super - eddington agns with @xmath67 , the ir emission from nlr clouds can dominate the ir emission from the dusty torus .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) .",
    "however , we should mention that the nlr size , @xmath131 , is about @xmath0 times as large as the sublimation radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the dust temperature of nlr clouds is lower than the hottest dust temperature ( i.e. , 1500 k ) .",

    "thus , the magnitude relation between @xmath168 and @xmath172 may determine the structure of the inner part of the dusty torus , as in the following three cases .",
    "( i ) if @xmath173 , the inner radius of the torus , @xmath89 , may be determined by @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of fig .",
    "( ii ) when @xmath174 , the structure of the dusty torus is like fig .",
    "as mentioned above , the dust can survive at even @xmath175 , though the structure within @xmath172 is geometrically thin because there is no energy source in this region .",
    "thus , the nir emission from @xmath176 is negligible since the covering factor becomes small .",
    "that is , @xmath89 is determined by the radius for which the dusty torus is gravitationally unstable .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath177 , the dust temperature of the whole inner edge of the dusty torus becomes lower than @xmath92 because @xmath178 is much larger than @xmath90 .",
    "if this is the case , the structure of the dusty torus is similar to fig .",
    "by exploring the relation between the region of nuclear starbursts and that of the hot dust , we may find evidence revealing the formation of the dusty torus .",
    "we now discuss the evolutionary tracks of smbh growth in the @xmath55@xmath2 diagram . as mentioned in @xmath180 , although the formation mechanism of the obscuring torus is still a hotly debated issue ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite proposed a dusty torus supported by turbulent pressure , in which the turbulence is produced by sn explosions ( see also @xcite ) . in their model , the geometrical thickness of the torus , which is determined by the balance between the gravity of the central bh and the force due to turbulent pressure , is smaller for more massive bhs .",
    "this tendency is consistent with observations in which the covering factor of the dusty torus decreases with increasing bh mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this model also implies that @xmath2 increases with time as the bh grows .",
    "that is , the evolution proceeds from left to right in the @xmath55@xmath2 diagram ( see fig .",
    "we consider two simple scenarios : ( i ) the super - eddington growth dominated scenario where most of the mass of the smbhs is supplied not through sub - eddington accretion discs but through super - eddington accretion discs .",
    "( ii ) the sub - eddington growth dominated scenario where the sub - eddington accretion disc mainly feeds the smbh .",
    "figure 6 shows the evolutionary tracks for these two scenarios , assuming an initial opening angle of the torus of @xmath181 and initially @xmath54 .",
    "we find from this figure that the agns stay in a super - eddington phase ( @xmath182 ) for a long time ( a wide range of @xmath2 ) in case ( i ) , whereas in case ( ii ) the agns shift to a sub - eddington phase when the torus is relatively thick .",
    "the two distinct scenarios can be clearly understood from fig . 3",
    "as follows : for case ( i ) the evolution proceeds from top left @xmath183 top right @xmath183 bottom right , whereas for case",
    "( ii ) it goes from top left @xmath183 bottom left @xmath183 bottom right .",
    "that is , the agns never undergo a phase of extremely low @xmath55 for case ( ii ) . in contrast , in case ( i ) , many agns can be identified as ir faint objects .",
    "the nir luminosity of such agns is also very small .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath55 as well as @xmath6 for case ( i ) is significantly larger than that for case ( ii ) .",
    "if the majority of high-@xmath15 quasars ( @xmath184 ) are nir - faint , super - eddington growth may be inevitable for smbh growth in the early universe . in order to compare the predictions with observations in detail",
    ", we must elucidate the evolution of @xmath6 based on the coevolution model of smbh growth and a circumnuclear disc such as @xcite .",
    "this is a subject for future work .",
    "increases ( see text ) .",
    "we assume that the initial opening angle of the torus is @xmath36 and @xmath54 .",
    ", height=245 ]      in this paper , we predicted that super - eddington agns with @xmath67 have relatively low @xmath8 .",
    "so far , more than 30 quasars have been discovered at @xmath185 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that two are unusually nir - faint quasars , i.e. , their ratio of @xmath186 is one order of magnitude smaller than the average for ordinary quasars , although their properties are similar to those of low-@xmath15 quasars in the rest - frame ultraviolet / optical and x - ray bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more interestingly , the two quasars have the smallest bh mass ( @xmath187 ) and the highest eddington ratios ( @xmath188 ) of @xmath9 quasar samples .",
    "these features can be nicely explained by our interpretation , i.e. , the faint nir emission for high eddington agns .",
    "we should note that since nir - faint quasars can be explained by sub - eddington agns with extremely thin tori ( i.e. , @xmath189 ) , we need to measure the thickness of a dusty torus to confirm whether nir - faint quasars are really super - eddington agns ( @xmath190 ) . based on the kinematics of cold molecular gas in a torus , it would be possible to evaluate the thickness of a torus by alma , because the ratio of velocity dispersion and rotational velocity indicates the scale height of the torus ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xcite interpreted these two objects as dust - free quasars .",
    "however , this seems to contradict the observations , which suggests that nir - faint quasars possess super - metallicity as do other @xmath9 quasars and high-@xmath15 agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , @xcite recently reported quasars with unusually faint nir emission at @xmath191@xmath192 , when the universe was 24 gyr old .",
    "thus , it seems likely that nir - faint quasars are exclusively dust - free agns . as an alternative scenario ,",
    "a large fraction of gas in a dusty torus would be ejected from host galaxies as a result of strong radiation pressure from the brightest agns , such as quasars @xcite . in this case , nir - faint quasars may be explained as being quasars without dusty tori around the smbh .",
    "this possibility could be confirmed by investigating the presence of dusty tori in nir - faint quasars using alma .    in the local universe , nls1s",
    "are thought to be agns of a high @xmath193 system .",
    "one nls1 ( ark 564 ) shows no nir emission @xcite , which is consistent with our predictions . however , most nls1s tend to have nir emission similar to or stronger than that of ordinary seyfert galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the reasons for the discrepancy between our predictions and the observations is that nls1s with @xmath67 may be absent ( or their fraction is very small ) .",
    "however , some nls1s have a high mass accretion rate with @xmath67 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that these discrepancies may suggest misalignment between the accretion discs and the dusty torus , as mentioned in @xmath180 .",
    "lastly , we note the possibility of contamination of hosts and circumnuclear starbursts in the nir band , if the host luminosity is comparable to or exceeds the agn luminosity , as in seyfert galaxies . although it may be hard to find many nls1s with low @xmath6 in current observations , in future studies it is worth examining this issue by nir ( rest frame ) observations with high spatial resolution .",
    "in this work , we propose a new method to search for candidate galaxies in which super - eddington growth occurs .",
    "in particular , taking account of the dependence of the polar angle on the radiation flux of accretion flows , we investigate the properties of reprocessed ir emission ( as well as nir emission ) from the inner edge of the dusty torus . as a result",
    ", we find that a relatively low ratio of agn ir ( as well as nir ) luminosity and disc luminosity is a genuine property that can be used for exploring for candidates of super - eddington agns with @xmath67 .",
    "this method is especially powerful for searching for high-@xmath15 super - eddington agns because the direct measurement of @xmath29 is difficult for high-@xmath15 agns compared with nearby agns .",
    "the following are the main results of the present paper :    1 .",
    "we find that the ratio of the agn ir luminosity , @xmath38 , and the disc bolometric luminosity , @xmath35 , decreases as the half opening angle of the dusty torus , @xmath2 , increases and the mass accretion rate normalized by the eddington rate , @xmath29 , increases .",
    "the dependence of the ratio on @xmath29 is caused by the self - occultation effect , which attenuates the illumination of the torus via the self - absorption of the emission from the inner disc surface at the outer region of super - eddington accretion discs .",
    "the ratio in super - eddington agns with @xmath67 is more than one order of magnitude lower than that in sub - eddington agns with @xmath23@xmath17 for @xmath7 ( @xmath194 ) and for @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "a small value of @xmath197 could be a signature of super - eddington accretion with @xmath67 , since it can not be realized in sub - eddington agns , unless the torus has quite a wide opening angle , @xmath4 .",
    "we also examined the properties of the agn near - ir luminosity ( @xmath87 ) radiated from hot dust at @xmath198 , because it may be hard to detect pure agn ir emission from the inner edge of a torus because of contamination of the nuclear starburst . in this case , @xmath199 of super - eddington agns with @xmath67 is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that for sub - eddington agns over a wide range of half opening angle ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "this is true regardless of which of the three typical models of the dusty torus is used .",
    "we appreciate the useful comments of the anonymous referees that reviewed this paper .",
