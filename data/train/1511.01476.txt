    "this article studies the random time evolution of the modulation of turbulence in transitional plane couette flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "plane couette flow is the flow between two parallel plates moving in opposite directions and separated by a constant gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this flow is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers @xmath0 , the control parameter . as a consequence ,",
    "the transition to turbulence is discontinuous : turbulence requires finite amplitude perturbations to be triggered . besides",
    ", turbulent flow can coexist in space and time with laminar flow , provided that @xmath1 , the global threshold of transition .",
    "there are several manner to define this threshold : @xmath2 can be the reynolds number under which turbulence is not sustained permanently @xcite , or more precisely , the reynolds number under which the mean lifetime of a turbulent germ equals the mean time elapsed before that germ splits @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing property of the flow is that up to @xmath3 , turbulence is sustained , but does not invade the whole domain .",
    "instead , it takes the form of regular apparently quasi steady oblique laminar - turbulent bands @xcite . above @xmath4",
    ", turbulence occupies the whole domain : again , this reynolds number has several definitions , all related to the disappearance of the laminar troughs @xcite .",
    "note that the bands can have the two orientations ( termed @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) with equal probability .",
    "these bands correspond to a sinusoidal modulation of the amplitude of turbulence @xcite .",
    "said modulation disappears in a very intermittent manner near @xmath4 @xcite , which may in fact be very similar to a critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "understanding the type of noise felt by the band is fundamental in explaining to what extent this similarity goes .    * * ( a ) * * sets the vertical.,title=\"fig:\",width=151]**(b ) * * sets the vertical.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    there have been many attempts at understanding the hydrodynamic mechanisms sustaining the bands .",
    "advection of small scale structures ( size of the gap ) by a large scale flow ( size of the bands ) is central in each of these discussions @xcite .",
    "the topic is still open , since the effect of these small scale structures on the large scale flow has not been precisely explained .",
    "comparatively , the modeling of the laminar - turbulent coexistence is more advanced .",
    "model equations have been proposed that describe the amplitude and localisation of turbulence @xcite or the amplitude of modulation of turbulence @xmath7 ( the bands ) @xcite .",
    "said amplitude of modulation is usually computed from a fourier transform of the velocity field @xcite . in both cases",
    ", it is very clear that fluctuating quantities with well defined pdfs and moments are the observables of interest @xcite .",
    "the time average of the modulation of turbulence ( or the most probable value @xcite ) shares many properties of pattern formation or of the average of an order parameter in a critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this led to the proposal of ginzburg  landau types of models , for an order parameter @xmath8 , in order to describe the deterministic part of the evolution of the amplitude of modulation of turbulence @xmath7 .",
    "the modeling of its fluctuations , and the noise term that should be added to these evolution equations , are not that simple .",
    "indeed , in the case of the amplitude of turbulence , it is clear that the noise level felt is a growing function of said amplitude , and that both go to zero together .",
    "several types of power law dependencies have been proposed @xcite .",
    "this fact is consistent with the assertion that transition to turbulence in shear flows is extremely similar to direct percolation ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the langevin description of reaction diffusion models such as dp , the correlations of the noise are proportional to the fields amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these langevin equations are derived from the field theories constructed to study the phase transitions in such models @xcite . meanwhile , some authors proposed additive gaussian stochastic forcing for the modeling of the small scale rolls and streaks @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the covariance of their noise is directly dependent on the mean kinetic energy .    in the case of the amplitude of modulation of turbulence ,",
    "additive white noise has been included in the first model equation for the band on qualitative grounds @xcite .",
    "the comparison with experimental results is satisfactory .",
    "the physical idea motivating this model is that the noise amplitude is still related to the amplitude of turbulence , which can be thought of as a constant when considering the amplitude of modulation of turbulence .",
    "this assumes of course that @xmath0 is not too close to @xmath2 .",
    "this type of modeling has been tested more quantitatively when considering the random walk of the relative position of the band @xcite , or the orientation fluctuations @xcite , in numerical simulations .",
    "however , only the later study revealed the the fluctuations of the amplitude of modulation .",
    "the range of reynolds numbers over which the lifetime in one orientation could be compared to the arhenius type law predicted by the model was not large enough for the noise modeling to be entirely validated .",
    "the precise description of the type of noise felt by the amplitude of modulation is fundamental to the understanding of the disappearance of the modulation at @xmath4 . in particular , the assertion that this phenomenon could be described by a critical phenomenon at equilibrium depends on the noise being additive and not multiplicative @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to fully justify the use of stochastic amplitude equation models for the laminar turbulent coexistence , each of the prediction of said model must be compared to numerical or experimental data .    in this article , we will endeavour to test said predictions on the temporal evolution of the modulation of turbulence under its own noise .",
    "we will take two points of views : that of the fluctuations of well established bands around their average , and the noisy growth of bands from uniform turbulence",
    ". indeed , if one excludes the case of switching of orientation , the bands only evolve in these two situations . in order to do so ,",
    "we proceed in the following manner . in section  [ sgl ] , we remind the stochastic ginzburg  landau model , which we analyse analytically and numerically in the two cases of interest . in section  [ num ]",
    ", we present our numerical procedure , and the processing of numerical data .",
    "we then analyse the numerical simulations in section  [ res ] and compare the results to theory .",
    "we eventually discuss the results altogether in the conclusion (   [ conc ] ) .",
    "we introduce the stochastic landau limit of the ginzburg  landau ",
    "langevin models used to describe the oblique bands in taylor  couette flow @xcite and plane couette flow @xcite .",
    "this model describes the evolution of two complex fields @xmath9 and reads : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the time scale , @xmath12 are the correlation lengths , @xmath13 are positive inverse saturation amplitudes and @xmath14 is a white noise in time and space of variance @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 we use brackets @xmath17 for the ensemble averages .",
    "the moduli @xmath18 describe the amplitude of modulation of turbulence at the corresponding orientation @xmath19 .",
    "the phases describe their relative positions in the flow .",
    "this type of equation , with @xmath20 , arises in weakly non - linear instabilities , particularly in pattern formation , when one performs a projection on the central manifold , that is , an elimination of the fast evolving space and time scales @xcite .",
    "this type of equation arises in phase transitions as well , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the temperature and @xmath23 the boltzmann constant , where it is often termed model a ( gradient system without a conservation law for @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "the actual framework in which the band falls is unclear , although it contains elements from these two fields of physics . indeed , even though it is an hydrodynamical phenomenon , the mechanisms of sustainment appear to be rather different from classical pattern formation instabilities @xcite . no derivation from first hydrodynamical principles has been proposed .",
    "the type of coexistence , quasi steady bands or generally intermittent , depends a lot on the size of the domain @xcite .",
    "the use of the ginzburg  landau model to describe the bands is therefore in the same line of thought as the use of the landau theory to describe phase transitions .",
    "the equation is obtained through an experience of thought : a `` coarse graining '' : this is an average over the fast spatial scales of the actual hydrodynamics .",
    "the equation is then used to describe and understand the main physical properties of the system .",
    "indeed , the formal resemblance between amplitude of modulation @xmath19 and @xmath24 : slow spatial variation , symmetries , noisy signal , phase invariance , no superposition of @xmath25 fields , continuous apparition at @xmath26 , justified the proposition of such a model to match @xmath19 , with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "many experimental and numerical data were perfectly matched by the model , and gave values for constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , ranges for @xmath11 and estimates of @xmath31 .",
    "the strength of such stochastic models is that they are easily analysed for large scale systems @xcite .",
    "we can make predictions that can then be verified in laboratory or numerical experiments . in the case of plane couette flow ,",
    "the timescales of the competitions between domains of @xmath5 and @xmath6 orientation ( see @xcite ) may very well have time scales deriving from coarsening dynamics ( as noted in @xcite ) .",
    "said dynamics are typical of competitions between domains of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in models like the gl equation ( eq .  ( [ gll ] ) )",
    "more surprisingly , the very intermittent behaviour at the disappearance of modulation may be very similar to a critical phenomenon @xcite .      since our dns are performed in a domain containing a few wavelengths of the band , we move to the landau version of the ginzburg ",
    "langevin model @xcite : @xmath32 the main difference with model  ( [ gll ] ) lies in the fact that @xmath24 is now only a function of time .",
    "the spatial derivatives are replaced by the distances to the optimal wavenumber of the band : @xmath33 , with @xmath34 both depending on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this modification is the same as the one performed in pattern formation , when a modulation of wavelength @xmath35 arises @xcite .",
    "there is one subtle difference : this equation is derived from a spatial average of equation  [ gll ] , the noise is changed from @xmath36 with variance @xmath15 to @xmath37 with variance @xmath38 .",
    "this type of noise forcing should be expected for spatially averaged quantities .",
    "for instance , in the case of the average kinetic energy , this is consistent with the finding that their probability density functions @xmath39 have large deviations in the limit of large size @xcite : @xmath40 the function @xmath41 is termed a large deviation function @xcite .",
    "it appears to be a parabola in a very large range of reynolds numbers , making @xmath42 a gaussian random variable .    in a statistically steady state ,",
    "one finds one solution of equation  ( [ eq10 ] ) of spatial and ensemble average @xmath43 if @xmath44 .",
    "this solution describes uniform turbulence .",
    "one finds two solutions @xmath45 , @xmath46 provided @xmath47 if @xmath48 .",
    "these two solutions describe a flow where one orientation of the band is dominant and small traces of the other orientation are found , due to turbulent noise @xcite .",
    "this model can be written using the potential @xmath49 : @xmath50 the interest of a potential approach lies in the mean field treatment of the problem : _",
    "i.e. _ the assimilation of the average to the most likely value when relative fluctuations are small @xcite .",
    "if one is concerned by the dynamics of the modulus @xmath8 of only one orientation , because the other is negligible or the interactions are weak , the last non - linear coupling term can be neglected . in order to obtain the equation describing the time evolution of the modulus of @xmath8",
    ", one must make a change of variable @xmath51 ( dropping the @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is non - linear and implies some subtleties .",
    "indeed , a stochastic process of the form : @xmath53 with @xmath54 a white noise , can have several meaning which are explicit only when time is discretised .",
    "the most common definition is termed the it rule , where the discretised equation reads : @xmath55 one can demonstrate that performing a change of variables in the same manner as for an ordinary differential equation yields a different physical process ( see for instance @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .    in order to perform the change of variables : a first strategy to change variables can be deriving the fokker ",
    "plank equation for the modulus and phase , and then deducing the langevin equation for the modulus with a it rule .",
    "one can alternatively use the it formula directly in the langevin equation ( see @xcite ",
    "4.5.5 for a similar derivation ) .",
    "both yields an over damped langevin equation : @xmath56 with @xmath57 a gaussian white noise of variance @xmath58 .",
    "the main consequence of the non - linear change of variable is the introduction of the drift @xmath59 , which prevents the modulus from reaching @xmath60 , a property of the modulus of a complex random variable .",
    "this is the dynamical equivalent of the pdf going to zero for @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the approach and the results are in the same spirit if the coupling @xmath29 is taken into account .",
    "we first study the time evolution of the modulus of the order parameter @xmath8 around the steady state @xmath62 for @xmath63 . for that matter",
    ", we use the time autocorrelation function : @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "this function contains information that simpler estimators does not .",
    "firstly , the amplitude of this function indicates the corresponding amplitude of the time fluctuations of @xmath8 , and the decay time of this function indicates the correlation time of @xmath8 .",
    "secondly , when examined in more details , the shape of this function indicates in which regime the transitional flow is . in this section",
    "we examine the case where relaminarisation and orientation fluctuations are so rare that one can consider that they do not occur .",
    "this will yield a specific type of correlation function which goes hand in hand with the parabolic shape of the large deviation function @xmath66 ( eq .  ( [ ldp ] ) )",
    "note that near @xmath2 , where relaminarisations can occur and the correlation function , along with the large deviation function , is quite different @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the order parameter around equilibrium is given by equation  [ eqchvar ] .",
    "one can neglect the drift term in the evolution equation , which now reads : @xmath67 with @xmath68 , if the evolution is well described by the potential ( eq .  ( [ eqchvar ] ) ) .",
    "the expansion around equilibrium , with a decay rate @xmath69 , is still valid , even when one enters the range of @xmath0 in which the deterministic part of the evolution equation is more complex than the landau ",
    "langevin equation @xcite .",
    "the solution of the equation is : @xmath70    one has the product @xmath71 : @xmath72 taking the ensemble average , it yields : @xmath73 the time @xmath74 is taken smaller than @xmath75 ( the choice is of no consequence to the rest of the derivation ) : @xmath76 _ i.e. _ @xmath77 a few simplifications can be performed if @xmath78 : @xmath79 and if @xmath74 and @xmath75 are very large compared to @xmath80 : @xmath81 this yields classical exponentially decreasing time correlations .",
    "the autocorrelation function can be computed from ensemble averaging of the time series , divided in @xmath82 times series of duration @xmath83 , in the same way as the fluctuations of the phase @xcite : @xmath84\\,.\\label{flucmod}\\ ] ] the analytical result and the processing procedure can be validated by the numerical simulations of the landau model . in a test case , for arbitrary values of the parameters ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 )",
    ", we compute the autocorrelation in the @xmath90 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig38 ] ( a ) ) . in figure  [ fig38 ] ( b )",
    "we display the logarithm of the autocorrelation function as a function of @xmath91 by varying @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) and keeping @xmath75 constant ( resp .",
    "@xmath74 ) .",
    "the logarithm of the autocorrelation function along a @xmath74 or @xmath75 constant line confirms that the prediction of an exponential decrease is good ( fig .",
    "[ fig38 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "a fit of the logarithm by @xmath92 , yields @xmath93 and @xmath94 , to be compared respectively to @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the comparison to the value of @xmath97 shows an error of only @xmath98% .",
    "however , the error is much larger in the case of @xmath99 : although the laws are correctly predicted by analytics , there is an overestimate of the constant @xmath11",
    ". we will be wary of that fact in the analysis of the numerical simulation of the navier  stokes equation .",

    "this models the appearance of the band from uniform turbulence .",
    "our goal is to propose a description of the growth that goes beyond the exponential growth and to describe the non linear effect and the effect of noise on the growth . in practice",
    "this amounts to the solving of equation  ( [ eqchvar ] ) : @xmath100 starting from a nearly zero initial condition @xmath101 .",
    "we will use two strategies , both of them being of the stochastic structural stability theory type @xcite , and we will determine the proper `` nearly zero '' that describes uniform turbulence .",
    "these theories consist of computing the ensemble average trajectory @xmath102 and the fluctuations around them , @xmath103 .",
    "most trajectories will be contained within @xmath104 of the average .",
    "this function indicates the shape that a group of independent realisations of the growth display when put together .",
    "the first approach consists of a mean field approximation : the fluctuations , of the order of the noise @xmath31 , are assumed to be small relative to the average .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath8 verifies the equation where the noise @xmath54 is removed , with the initial condition @xmath101 .",
    "meanwhile the fluctuations @xmath103 are treated as a linear perturbation of the deterministic part of the equation , of the same order as the noise .",
    "it is somewhat artificial but the qualitative content appears more clearly .",
    "the second approach consists of solving in the limit of @xmath105 not too small compared to @xmath106 by using an expansion in @xmath107 : @xmath108 with the initial conditions @xmath109 and @xmath110 . due to the expansion , each @xmath111 is the solution of a linear langevin equation , with time varying coefficients .",
    "since all of them are real , no resonance appears and solvability conditions are unnecessary .",
    "this expansion is more rigorous and robust in terms of order of approximation but less tractable .",
    "it mainly helps to validate the mean field strategy .",
    "both solutions introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath112 , a ginzburg criterion type term @xcite , which weighs the fluctuations @xmath113 ( see   [ fluc ] or @xcite ) over the amplitude of the average @xmath114 .",
    "the mean field approach is valid and the expansion converges rapidly only if @xmath115 is small .    in order to understand the features of the expanded solution , one can truncate the expansion at @xmath116 and compute @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , at the first non - zero order in noise , the average @xmath120 only retains the terms @xmath121 , while the fluctuations are @xmath122 .",
    "this is because the first order contains @xmath101 , which is decorrelated from @xmath54 , @xmath118 contains @xmath54 and @xmath119 contains a deterministic term and @xmath123 .",
    "this order of approximation is a more rigorous formulation of the first method .",
    "we proceed in the following way .",
    "we first compute the distribution of initial conditions .",
    "we then present the ensemble averages and fluctuations solutions .",
    "we eventually summarise the analysis and discuss the specificity of the evolution of the solutions .",
    "we first compute the initial condition @xmath101 .",
    "we follow the mean field approximation of earlier studies of the bands @xcite . in a former article @xcite , the average of the order parameter in the landau ",
    "langevin limit was obtained in the mean field limit by computing the minimum of the potential @xmath124 ( eq .  ( [ eq12 ] ) ) . in the spirit of the mean field , the pdf @xmath125",
    "is approximated by a gaussian centered around the minimum of @xmath124 : @xmath126 if turbulence is uniform , one finds the minimum @xmath127 .",
    "we use @xmath128 and @xmath129 so as to differentiate them from the value they take during the growth of the band @xmath63 . in order to obtain the fluctuations @xmath130 ,",
    "one simply has to expand @xmath124 to the second order and identify the corresponding coefficient with @xmath130 .",
    "one then finds : the fluctuations @xmath131 . in order to weigh the amplitude of the initial condition relatively to that of the final value",
    ", we introduce another dimensionless parameter @xmath132 .      starting from equation : @xmath133 we apply the mean field approach .    in order to obtain the average , one has to solve : @xmath134 with the initial condition @xmath135 .",
    "the full resolution is somewhat involved , we describe it in appendix  [ afull ] .",
    "the solution is given by equation  ( [ sol_gen ] ) .",
    "if we consider the noise @xmath31 , @xmath128 , or the amplitude of the non linearity @xmath28 to be small but non zero , we can simultaneously take the limit @xmath136 and keep the first non zero order in equation  ( [ solrw ] ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the first stage of the growth .",
    "this gives the equation : @xmath137 this reveals an interesting effect : it shows an increase of the growth rate with the noise when @xmath138 is small , embodied by @xmath115 .",
    "it strengthens the observation that the noise in the numerical solution of the stochastic gl equation modifies the growth rate @xcite .",
    "besides , it contains the trace of the fluctuations at @xmath139 , that decreases exponentially with a rate @xmath140 : the second term in the square root should decrease before we have clear exponential growth .",
    "if one takes @xmath141 in equation  ( [ solrw ] ) , we find the classical solution of the landau equation : @xmath142 the first approximation described the growth of @xmath8 away from @xmath60 .",
    "the second describes the convergence toward @xmath143 , this contains a simplified version of the non - linear effects of the third stage , _ i.e. _ saturation , without the competition between orientations .",
    "the average in the expansion contains the same physics as in the mean field approximation (   [ aexp ] , eq .  ( [ dampa ] ) ) .",
    "it validates this approximation for @xmath115 small .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath144 are obtained by solving : @xmath145 one can write @xmath146 , with @xmath147 and @xmath148 and @xmath149 verifying @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "one simply finds : @xmath152 which yields @xmath153 : @xmath154 the fluctuations have a zero average around the mean at order @xmath155 in @xmath31 , even in logarithmic scale , since one has : @xmath156 we compute the explicit expression of the ensemble average of @xmath153 and @xmath118 in appendix  [ eas ] .",
    "the calculation is the same in both cases .      the time dependence of @xmath103 ( eq .",
    "( [ eqb1 ] ) ) and its moments are not obvious .",
    "we perform a few approximations to make them more explicit . at small times",
    ", @xmath8 is small and @xmath157 can be expanded . in the first order ,",
    "it is equal to @xmath138 . inserting in equation  [ flucb1 ]",
    ", one has : @xmath158 which can be rewritten and integrated : @xmath159_{t'=0}^t\\,.\\ ] ] one eventually finds : @xmath160 note that this means that in the growth phase , the fluctuations of the logarithm of the order parameter @xmath161 given by equation  ( [ logsig ] ) are constant . indeed : @xmath162 is the ratio of two functions growing exponentially at the same rate .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath153 and @xmath163 have two successive regimes : expansion then retraction of perturbations induced by noise . from a different point of view , the first regime is controlled by linear growth and the second is controlled by non - linear saturations .",
    "the quantity : @xmath164 and more particularly the sign of @xmath165 , controls the regime in which the band is .",
    "this is exact in the case of the expansion and in good approximation in the mean - field case . indeed , when considering equation  ( [ eqb1 ] ) , one can see that the amplitude of the noise will be multiplied or divided , depending on the sign of the quantity in the exponential . the value of @xmath74 ( and the corresponding @xmath102 at which it changes signs can be easily estimated in order zero in noise ( eq .  ( [ a_temps_bis ] ) ) .",
    "indeed , one has : @xmath166 the numerator cancels out provided the initial condition is small enough ( @xmath167 ) and does so at : @xmath168 one then has @xmath169 at the first non - zero order in noise amplitude .    at long times",
    "@xmath170 , one can have a qualitative discussion about the behaviour of fluctuations (   [ ftt ] ) .",
    "the rate at which they grow decreases in time , the expansion becomes slower and slower until time reaches @xmath171 ( eq .",
    "( [ tps ] ) ) , at which time non - linear effects are felt and the analytics depart from the behaviour of the flow .",
    "indeed , they do not contain the competition between orientations @xmath24 .",
    "the analytical description of the switching is limited to the transition from one well to another ( _ via _ residency times @xcite ) .",
    "after said competition , both analytics and the flow agree again .",
    "in that last regime , one finds that the fluctuations decrease in time , and connect with the autocorrelation studied in the next section .    at longer times , the same type of expansion that has been done at small times can be done , and yields the results of the former section , that is , the autocorrelation function .",
    "again , the fluctuations in the expansion contain the same content as that of the mean field solution ( eq .  ( [ flucb1 ] ) ) , and recover the exponential decay of the initial fluctuations ( eq .  ( [ dampa ] ) ) .",
    "note that the time evolution of this term is deterministic ( exponential decay ) , only its amplitude and its sign is random .",
    "we simulate the incompressible navier  stokes equations in the plane couette configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we use periodical boundary conditions in the streamwise ( @xmath172 ) and spanwise ( @xmath173 ) directions .",
    "the velocities are made dimensionless by @xmath174 and the sizes by @xmath175 and durations by @xmath176 , which leaves the reynolds number @xmath177 , with @xmath178 the kinematic viscosity as the control parameter of the flow .",
    "the whole behaviour of the flow is set by @xmath0 together with the sizes @xmath179 and @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "the numerical integration is performed using the code channelflow written by j. gibson @xcite .",
    "we follow two different procedures . on the one hand , we perform classical direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , with a resolution of @xmath181 dealiased fourier modes per unit length in the streamwise and spanwise directions and @xmath182 chebychev modes in the wall normal direction .",
    "this number of modes has proven sufficient to obtain well resolved dns @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we use the code to run a reduced order model . for that matter",
    ", we use @xmath155 dealiased fourier mode per unit length in the streamwise direction , @xmath183 dealised fourier modes per unit length in the spanwise direction and @xmath98 chebychev modes in the wall normal direction .",
    "this approach gives reliable representations of the bands and does not alter the physics of the flow @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is a decrease of the transition thresholds from @xmath184\\approx [ 325 ; 415]$ ] to @xmath185 $ ] @xcite .    for both procedures , the oblique bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) are obtained in the following way : we start from a smooth random initial condition .",
    "it is then integrated in time at @xmath186 ( for dns ) or at @xmath187 ( low order modeling ) for a duration of @xmath188 .",
    "this gives a realistic uniformly turbulent flow .",

    "the comparison between the current results and those of a former article shows the clear timescale separation between the formation of laminar holes and the organisation into oblique bands @xcite .",
    "the former phenomenon is most likely a local process , which is caused by viscous decay and failure of sustainment of turbulence",
    ". it should be present in all shear flows , including those which do not have a spanwise extension like hagen  poiseuille pipe flow .",
    "meanwhile , the second phenomenon is most likely a combination of global processes , which involves the advection of small scale structure by large scale flows and feed back on turbulence ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "on the other hand , these results further strengthen the assertion that the amplitude of modulation of turbulence is very well described by a ginzburg  landau equation with an additive noise .",
    "this means that some interesting properties of this type of equation should be expected for the modulation of turbulence .",
    "in particular , this allows us to easily predict facts that should manifest themselves in very large size systems .",
    "for instance , quenches in very large systems first lead to a spatial coexistence of domains of both orientations .",
    "it is very likely that the dynamics of the domain sizes is predicted by the gl equation , which means that we would find coarsening dynamics and specific exponents for the domain sizes as function of time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is also very likely that the behaviour predicted near @xmath4 : a critical phenomenon and the divergence of the response function of @xmath19 with size as @xmath245 should arise from the very intermittent regime of @xmath246 .",
    "early simulations indicate that this is very likely the case @xcite .",
