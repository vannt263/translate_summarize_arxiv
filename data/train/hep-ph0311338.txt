    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive and best studied extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "with susy the hierarchy problem can be solved and the mass of the higgs boson can be stabilized against radiative corrections . while this is certainly the main motivation , susy gives us the additional benefit of introducing potential new sources of cp violation @xcite .",
    "as the tiny amount of cp violation in the sm is not sufficient to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , the systematic study of all implications of the complex susy parameters becomes absolutely necessary .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effects of complex susy parameters on the phenomenology of the scalar top quark and scalar bottom quark system . analysing the properties of 3rd generation sfermions",
    "is particularly interesting , because of the effects of the large yukawa couplings .",
    "their lighter mass eigenstates may be among the light susy particles and they could be investigated at the tevatron and at @xmath8 linear colliders @xcite@xcite . at lhc",
    "these states can be produced directly or in cascade decays of heavier susy particles @xcite@xcite .",
    "analyses of the decays of the 3rd generation sfermions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with real parameters have been performed in refs .",
    "phenomenological studies of production and decays of the 3rd generation sfermions at future @xmath8 linear colliders , again in the real mssm , have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .    in the mssm several susy",
    "breaking parameters and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath21 can be complex . in a complete phenomenological analysis of production and",
    "decays of third generation sfermions one has to take into account that the susy parameters @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are complex in general , where @xmath22 is the trilinear scalar coupling parameter of the sfermion @xmath25 , and the @xmath3 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gaugino mass parameters , respectively .",
    "this means that one has to study the effects of the phases of the parameters on all observables .",
    "an unambiguous signal for the cp phases would be provided by a measurement of a cp - odd observable .",
    "for example , in the case of sfermion decays a rate asymmetry @xcite and triple product correlations @xcite have been proposed as such observables .",
    "however , since it may be difficult to measure these cp - odd observables of the sfermions , cp - even observables like decay branching ratios may also be suitable to obtain informations about the susy cp phases .",
    "for example , the decay branching ratios of the higgs bosons depend strongly on the complex phases of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 sectors @xcite@xcite , while those of the staus @xmath19 and @xmath30-sneutrino @xmath20 can be quite sensitive to the phases of the stau and gaugino - higgsino sectors @xcite .",
    "also the yukawa couplings of the third generation sfermions are sensitive to the susy phases at one - loop level @xcite .",
    "furthermore , explicit cp violation in the higgs sector can be induced by @xmath28 and @xmath29 loops if the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath21 are complex @xcite .",
    "it is found @xcite that these cp phase effects could significantly influence the phenomenology of the higgs boson sector .",
    "the experimental upper bounds on the electric dipole moments ( edm s ) of electron , neutron and the @xmath31hg and @xmath32tl atoms may impose constraints on the size of the susy cp phases @xcite . however , these constraints are highly model dependent .",
    "this means that the various susy cp phases need not necessarily be small .",
    "for instance , if we adopt the mssm and assume a cancellation mechanism @xcite , it turns out that the phase of @xmath21 is restricted as @xmath33 while the phases @xmath34 of the @xmath22 parameters are not constrained . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of @xmath35 is not constrained by the edm s in a model where the masses of the first and second generation sfermions are large ( above the tev scale ) while the masses of the third generation sfermions are small ( below @xmath36  tev ) @xcite .",
    "the restrictions on @xmath37 due to the electron edm can also be circumvented if lepton flavour violating terms are present in the slepton sector @xcite .",
    "less restrictive constraints on the phases appear at two - loop level where 3rd generation sfermion loops can contribute to the edm s @xcite .    in this article",
    "we focus on the influence of the cp violating susy phases on the fermionic and bosonic two - body decay branching ratios of 3rd generation squarks @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we use the mssm as a general framework and we assume that the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath21 and @xmath3 are complex with phases @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively ( taking @xmath42 real ) .",
    "we neglect flavor changing cp phases and assume that the squark mass matrices and trilinear scalar coupling parameters are flavor diagonal .",
    "we take into account the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "if the top squark and bottom squark decay branching ratios show an appreciable phase dependence , this would also affect the analyses of the various gluino cascade decays such as those in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have published first results of our study . in the present paper",
    "we give the analytic expressions for the various decay widths for the complex parameters and study in detail the phase dependences of the branching ratios .",
    "we take into account the restrictions on the mssm parameters from the experimental data on the rare decay @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we give a theoretical estimate of the precision expected for the determination of the complex top squark and bottom squark parameters by measuring suitable observables including the decay branching ratios in typical future collider experiments .    in section 2",
    "we give the formulae necessary to calculate the @xmath44 and @xmath45 two - body decay widths in the presence of cp phases . in section 3",
