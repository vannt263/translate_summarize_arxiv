    "the issue of transversality in gromov s theory of pseudoholomorphic curves @xcite has always been problematic , and has attracted renewed interest in recent years . while many powerful symplectic invariants such as gromov - witten theory , hamiltonian floer homology and symplectic field theory are based on holomorphic curves , most of them run into severe technical complications unless multiply covered curves can be excluded , thus necessitating rather sophisticated techniques that typically replace the standard nonlinear cauchy - riemann equation by an abstract perturbation , see e.g.  @xcite . aside from the technical challenges that these methods pose , they are non - ideal for many applications : for instance abstract perturbations destroy intersection theory in symplectic @xmath1-manifolds , and in calabi - yau @xmath2-folds they obscure information that one might hope to find in the geometric relationship between simple curves and their multiple covers , as exemplified by the gopakumar - vafa conjecture @xcite .",
    "the motivating principle of this paper is in some sense orthogonal to that of abstract perturbations : our aim will be to extend the transversality theory for the _ standard _ pseudoholomorphic curve equation as far as it can reasonably be pushed , i.e.  to prove transversality when it is possible , and in other cases to isolate the precise phenomena which make it impossible and explain what is true instead .",
    "let us start by singling out two situations in which this program is not obviously hopeless .",
    "[ ex : unbranched ] if @xmath3 is a closed @xmath4-holomorphic curve and @xmath5 is an _",
    "unbranched _ cover of closed connected riemann surfaces with degree @xmath6 , then the virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces containing @xmath7 and @xmath8 , also known as the _ indices _ of these two curves , are related by @xmath9 since @xmath10 is then nonnegative whenever @xmath11 , there is no obvious reason why @xmath12 could not achieve transversality generically , but traditional methods in the theory of @xmath4-holomorphic curves do not prove this except when @xmath12 is simply covered , or in certain @xmath1-dimensional cases @xcite , or more recently , when @xmath13 if a sufficiently large space of perturbed almost complex structures is allowed @xcite .",
    "[ ex : super ] suppose @xmath3 is a closed simply covered curve with index  @xmath0 and @xmath5 is a branched cover of closed connected riemann surfaces with degree  @xmath6 and @xmath14 as the algebraic count of branch points . then combining the riemann - hurwitz formula @xmath15 with the standard index formula for closed holomorphic curves gives the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "this shows that @xmath12 can live in a space of negative virtual dimension when @xmath18 and thus can not generally achieve transversality , even though it will survive perturbations of @xmath4 as long as @xmath7 also does . it is interesting however to observe that @xmath7 must be immersed if @xmath4 is generic , so it has a well - defined normal bundle @xmath19 , and restricting the linearized cauchy - riemann operators for @xmath7 and @xmath12 to the normal bundle and its pullback gives operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 with indices related by @xmath22 the latter is always nonpositive , so @xmath23 can be injective , and this condition has a geometric meaning : as shown in proposition  [ prop : isolated ] below , it implies that @xmath12 can never be the limit of a sequence of somewhere injective curves .",
    "in fact , the only other curves near @xmath12 are other branched covers of the form @xmath24 for @xmath25 near  @xmath26 , and the cokernels of the operators @xmath23 define an obstruction bundle over the space of branched covers which can be used to compute gromov - witten invariants .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ super - rigidity _ , see definition  [ defn : super ] .",
    "considerable interest in super - rigidity has been motivated by the study of gromov - witten invariants in calabi - yau @xmath2-folds , notably the gopakumar - vafa conjecture .",
    "bryan and pandharipande observed in @xcite that while super - rigidity is a quite delicate question in the _ algebraic _ geometry of calabi - yau @xmath2-folds , it might reasonably be expected to hold generically in the symplectic setting .",
    "theorem  [ thm : super ] below states that this is true , in fact for generic @xmath4 , _ all _ somewhere injective closed @xmath4-holomorphic curves of index  @xmath0 in symplectic manifolds of dimension greater than four ( and also curves of low genus in dimension four ) are super - rigid .",
    "complementary to this , we will see in theorem  [ thm : unbranched ] that everything one could hope for in the setting of example  [ ex : unbranched ] is also true , and we will also be able to prove some transversality results for branched covers ( theorem  [ thm : branched ] ) .",
    "all of these results follow from a general picture of cauchy - riemann type operators with symmetries described in  [ sec : thebigidea ] , which has its origins in taubes s work on the gromov invariant of symplectic @xmath1-manifolds @xcite .",
    "while the results in this paper focus specifically on closed holomorphic curves , there is no obvious obstruction to applying the same techniques to study punctured curves in symplectic cobordisms , which we expect to have interesting applications in symplectic field theory @xcite and embedded contact homology @xcite .",
    "a few special cases of super - rigidity in the punctured case have previously been observed in @xcite ; those examples were restricted to dimension four , but the results of the present article suggest that super - rigidity is likely to hold in considerably greater generality .      to state the main results , assume @xmath27 is a symplectic manifold with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a smooth almost complex structure that is compatible with  @xmath30 , meaning that @xmath31 defines a riemannian metric on  @xmath32 .",

    "note that the existence of a symplectic form on @xmath32 is not required for any of the arguments in this paper , but we are including it in the setup since it is important in applications  all results could alternatively be stated and proved for the larger space of @xmath30-tame almost complex structures , or for arbitrary almost complex structures on a smooth ( not necessarily symplectic ) manifold .    following the usual convention among symplectic topologists",

    "the notion of super - rigidity was outlined already in example  [ ex : super ] ; see definition  [ defn : super ] for a more precise formulation .",

    "moreover , this result also holds when @xmath52 for all simple index  @xmath0 curves of genus  @xmath0 or  @xmath53 .",
    "super - rigidity has a number of well - known consequences , which are especially important in the case @xmath54 .",
    "these are based partly on the observation that the space of all covers of super - rigid curves is an open and closed subset of the ambient moduli space of @xmath4-holomorphic curves  we will prove the following statement in appendix  [ sec : isolated ] , see also corollary  [ cor : isolated ] .",

    "applying gromov compactness and the standard implicit function theorem for simple curves , plus the fact that simple @xmath4-holomorphic curves are generically embedded and disjoint from each other in dimensions greater than four , this implies :    [ cor : dimension6 ] for generic compatible @xmath4 in a closed symplectic @xmath67-manifold @xmath27 , there exist for each @xmath68 at most finitely many distinct simple @xmath4-holomorphic curves @xmath7 of genus  @xmath69 with @xmath70 .    using results of zinger @xcite and lee - parker @xcite ,",

    "the case @xmath81 of theorem  [ thm : unbranched ] has been proved previously in @xcite , though with stronger assumptions : for technical reasons , it was necessary in that paper to assume that @xmath71 is _ contained entirely _ in  @xmath35 , and in dimension four also to allow perturbations of @xmath4 that are @xmath30-tame but not necessarily @xmath30-compatible .",
    "the present paper uses a completely different approach to the transversality problem and is thus able to remove these restrictions .",

    "the proofs of these theorems are inspired by the work of taubes @xcite , whose definition of the gromov invariant for symplectic @xmath1-manifolds required a special case of theorem  [ thm : unbranched ] along with related bifurcation - theoretic results ( cf .",

    "ideally , one would like to show that these spaces are smooth manifolds for generic @xmath4 , and to compute their codimensions in the space of pairs @xmath105 .",

    "this discussion is oversimplified in at least three respects : first , we will not be able to find any nice structure on @xmath106 if @xmath26 varies in the space of _ all _ branched covers , but it will help to confine it to certain substrata of that space in which all branch points have prescribed branching orders . for similar reasons , it will also help to confine @xmath7 to substrata in which its number of critical points and their orders are constrained , and this is easily done . more seriously , the space @xmath106 as sketched above can have different codimensions on different components , as its codimension depends intricately on symmetry information which is ignored in .",
    "we will therefore need to define a more elaborate version of @xmath106 which depends on a splitting of the operator @xmath72 into summands corresponding to irreducible representations of the ( generalized ) symmetry group of the cover .",
    "this idea is borrowed directly from @xcite , though the details are somewhat more involved since , in contrast to the case of unbranched covers of tori , we can not assume that all covers are regular or that their symmetry groups are abelian .",
