    "molecular gas is regarded as the fuel for star formation . increasing evidence for non - standard initial mass functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and warm molecular gas in starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that its physical properties may influence the star formation rate and the properties of the next generation of stars .",
    "unfortunately , the physical properties of the molecular gas in external galaxies , in particular the kinetic temperature , are often not well constrained . the easily thermalized and optically thick co @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions could constitute a good temperature tracer , but the filling factor of extragalactic clouds is poorly constrained . other commonly observed molecules like hcn and hco@xmath7 are good density tracers , but require an a priori knowledge of the kinetic temperature .",
    "the inversion lines of the symmetric top molecule ammonia ( nh@xmath3 ) are frequently used as the galactic `` standard cloud thermometer '' . however , in the disk of the milky way , the fractional abundance of nh@xmath3 varies between @xmath8 in hot cores @xcite and @xmath9 in dark clouds @xcite .",
    "thus , ammonia may trace preferentially a specific component of the molecular gas and the assumption of an approximately constant fractional abundance on linear scales of a few 100pc is likely not valid .",
    "other symmetric or slightly asymmetric top molecules may therefore be more favorable for extragalactic line studies .      in this paper , we investigate the diagnostic properties of para - formaldehyde ( p - h@xmath0co ) lines in extragalactic sources .",
    "formaldehyde is formed on the surface of dust grains by successive hydrogenation of co @xcite , released into the gas phase by shocks or uv heating and subsequently destroyed by gas - phase processes .",
    "variations in fractional abundance rarely exceed one order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite found only little variation in a variety of galactic environments ranging from cool protostellar candidates to hot photon - dominated regions and infrared sources with the latter showing the highest discrepancy , by a factor of 5 to 10 .",
    "these higher abundances are likely caused by the release of h@xmath0co  molecules from grain surfaces in regions of massive star formation . as another example for the level of variability in the abundance of formaldehyde versus that of ammonia in active environments , the h@xmath0co   abundance is the same in the hot core and the compact ridge of orion a , whereas the nh@xmath3 abundance in the core is two orders of magnitude higher than that in the ridge @xcite .",
    "para - formaldehyde , which is a subspecies of the slightly asymmetric top molecule h@xmath0co , has a rich mm- and submm - spectrum of transitions .",
    "since the relative populations of the @xmath10 ladders are generally governed by collisions , line ratios involving different @xmath10 ladders ( inter - ladder ratios ) are generally good tracers of the kinetic temperature .",
    "with the temperature known , line ratios within a single @xmath10 ladder , the so - called intra - ladder ratios , whose populations are mainly determined by collisional excitation and radiative de - excitation , sensitively probe the gas density @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-doublet transitions of ortho - h@xmath0co  in the cm - range , @xmath12 at @xmath13 cm and @xmath14 at @xmath15 cm , have been observed in a number of external galaxies since the 1970s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but to date there are only three published studies of the excitation conditions of extragalactic molecular gas that utilize multi - line h@xmath0co  observations in combination with a non - lte treatment of the radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "the target for our exploratory investigation is the nearby prototypical starburst galaxy m82 . as the most prominent galaxy in the northern hemisphere with a nuclear starburst",
    ", m82 has been the target of numerous molecular line studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the excitation studies focus on the central 1kpc disk , where the molecular gas is concentrated in a circumnuclear ring around the center of the starburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the more highly excited lines found at smaller radii ( fig",
    ".  [ map ] , see also @xcite for an overview of ring diameters ) .",
    "note that the two lobes of the molecular ring in this highly inclined galaxy can be easily separated with single - dish telescopes and the observed molecular lines in the lobes have typical widths of only @xmath16 to @xmath17kms@xmath18   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus greatly reducing the potential for line blending .",
    "the most comprehensive co line studies to date @xcite suggest that the broad data base of co and @xmath19co lines observed towards the molecular lobes of m82 can not be fitted by a single - component large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model and that the majority of the molecular gas may actually be in a high - excitation state .",
    "the h@xmath0co(@xmath12 ) transition at @xmath13 cm was detected towards the nucleus of m82 _ in absorption _ by @xcite , whereas the h@xmath0co(@xmath14 ) line at @xmath15 cm was observed _ in emission _ , which was interpreted as evidence for very dense ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) molecular gas in the molecular ring @xcite .",

[ methanol ] ) and thus be of limited use for the lvg analysis . at the very high densities ( @xmath20@xmath21 * ? ? ? * ) and kinetic temperatures of 50k to 100k inferred for h@xmath0co  in m82 , our lvg code suggests a line ratio h@xmath0co(@xmath25)/h@xmath0co(@xmath27 ) of the order of unity , which sensitively traces the gas density .",

    "thus , the observed volume could contain a small number of large clouds , whose diameters are comparable to the source size , or a large number of small clouds , but the presence of only a single cloud within the beam is ruled out .",
    "+ the results for other choices of @xmath119 can be found in tables  [ neresults ] and [ swresults ] . in the optically thin limit ( see e.g.  models n1 and n2 ) , the small - scale dilution factor reaches its maximum value of @xmath120 and the temperature - density plots are almost independent of the assumed h@xmath0co  column density per velocity interval .",
    "thus , there is a lower limit to the kinetic temperatures and an upper limit to the gas densities consistent with our observations .",
    "we do not find a solution ( corresponding to the intersection of the curves for the line ratios ) in the calculated parameter space for @xmath121k ( ne lobe ) and @xmath122k ( sw lobe ) , respectively .",
    "the upper limit to the gas density is @xmath123 in both lobes .",
    "+ the assumed source size @xmath124 also has a significant influence on the derived parameters ( table  [ finalresults ] ) .",
    "a larger source size results in a lower kinetic temperature , a higher h@xmath0 density and a smaller small - scale dilution factor . but",
    "even if the h@xmath0co  emitting region is as large as 10 , the kinetic temperature in the lobes is @xmath125k , which is much higher than the dust temperature of @xmath126k @xcite or the commonly assumed kinetic temperatures of 30k to 100k .",
    "to summarize , the dominant component of the molecular gas in the lobes of m82 seems to be in a warm phase of moderate density .",
    "+      numerous previous studies have used molecular lines to derive the physical properties of the molecular gas in m82 .",
    "frequently , the small number of lines available to constrain the free parameters has led to the adoption of a kinetic temperature of @xmath127k , similar to the dust temperature @xmath126k @xcite .",
    "this assumption is supported by the results of early analyzes of the low-@xmath128 co lines ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and , more recently , by the ammonia study of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) .",
    "the most comprehensive data base exists for co and @xmath19co lines , which have been searched for up to @xmath129 @xcite and @xmath130 @xcite , respectively .",
    "based on this large collection of co lines , @xcite confirm that a one - component lvg model can not fit all the observed line intensities simultaneously .",
    "thus , in order to derive the properties of the high - excitation component , they restrict their lvg analysis to the high - j excitation lines in the submm - range , i.e. co(@xmath131 ) , co(@xmath132 ) , co(@xmath133 ) , and @xmath19co(@xmath133 ) . in the most recent multi - line co study , @xcite",
    "analyze the co and @xmath19co emission at all available transitions using a two - component plane - parallel lvg model .",
    "the physical properties of the high - excitation molecular gas phase derived from these comprehensive excitation studies are compared to our results in table  [ otherlvg ] . considering that our investigation is completely independent of the other studies , the results are remarkably similar .",
    "the physical properties derived from our h@xmath0co  data and our lvg model adopting a spherically symmetric cloud morphology lie well within the range of values found for the high - excitation component of the two - component lvg model by @xcite .",
    "in fact , our kinetic temperature is only 20k to 40k higher than their median value , which is influenced by the limited temperature range considered , and their median density is lower by only a factor of @xmath56 if the effect of using a plane - parallel model versus a spherically symmetric one is taken into account . the most striking difference between our results and the values derived by @xcite is their lower kinetic temperature .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is a small contribution of the cooler low - excitation component to the submm co line emission that would lower the average kinetic temperature of the one - component model .",
    "the presence of a warm gas component in nearby starburst galaxies with @xmath134 to 440k was also inferred from the detection of highly excited nh@xmath3 lines @xcite . in this study , m82 was the notable exception in not showing evidence for a warm molecular gas component in its nh@xmath3 emission .",
    "the ammonia inversion lines detected towards m82 suggest a rotational temperature of only 29k and thus a kinetic temperature of only @xmath135k in the sw lobe of m82 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find a warm molecular gas component with @xmath136k in a sample of starburst and seyfert galaxies including m82 by analyzing ir rotational h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "possible mechanisms that could heat a large fraction of the molecular gas to temperatures of @xmath137k include shocks , strong uv and/or x - ray irradiation ( pdr , xdr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the more uniform cosmic ray heating @xcite , in short processes that are likely to be found in an active environment such as a starburst .",
    "a comparison of the h@xmath0co  line widths and the derived molecular gas mass with the values derived from the co studies suggests that the h@xmath0co  lines trace approximately the same gas as traced by the ubiquitous co lines ( table  [ otherlvg ] ) . according to our data , each lobe contains warm molecular gas of about @xmath138 , which is in good agreement with the estimate by @xcite of @xmath139 and the mass of the molecular ring of @xmath140 derived by @xcite from the integrated intensity of their co(@xmath141 ) map .",
    "having modeled the physical conditions and the conversion factor @xmath142 at 18 positions along the circumnuclear ring as traced by high - resolution low - j co maps , @xcite find a molecular gas mass of @xmath143 in the ring , whereas applying the standard conversion factor @xmath144@xmath72(kkms@xmath18)@xmath18 to their data leads to a total mass of @xmath145 .",
    "in contrast to the results of the co and h@xmath0co  investigations , the observed ammonia inversion lines seem to arise from cold , probably well shielded regions within the ism @xcite .",
    "the physical properties derived in our analysis and the co studies suggest that the majority of the gas is in a warm state of comparatively low density ( @xmath1 ) ) , which fits well with the idea that m82 is in an advanced phase of a starburst .",
    "in such an environment , ammonia is easily photodissociated outside of the few remaining well - shielded regions @xcite , which may explain the extremely low nh@xmath3 column densities reported by @xcite .",
    "the detection of the h@xmath0co(@xmath25 ) line in both molecular lobes strongly suggests that there is h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission at these positions too . on the other hand , @xcite very recently reported the detection of methanol emission from the lobes of m82 including the highly excited @xmath146 transition .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect ch@xmath3oh(@xmath52 ) emission to originate from the two lobes as well . as a result ,",
    "the observed spectral features at 218.5ghz in both lobes most likely consist of the strongly blended emission of the h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) and the ch@xmath3oh(@xmath52 ) lines at 218.48ghz and at 218.44ghz , respectively .",
    "because of this blending , the spectral feature at @xmath147ghz was ignored in the lvg analysis in section  [ lvg ] .",
    "now we can use the results of our lvg models to derive the expected strengths of the h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission for different physical conditions ( tables  [ neresults ] and  [ swresults ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the computed values for each lobe vary by no more than 5% throughout the range of model parameters considered , which indicates that the h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission does not add significant constraints to the lvg analysis , probably because the similar h@xmath0co(@xmath25 ) line is already included . in order to deconvolve the highly blended lines , we fixed the integrated intensity of the h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission to the value derived from the models and fitted the five lines with the usual constraints ( table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "[ swlvg ] shows the resulting gaussian fits and the residual spectra in both lobes .",
    "the derived integrated intensities are summarized in table  [ lvgfits ] .    in the sw lobe",
    ", the h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission predicted by the lvg analysis agrees within @xmath148 with the previously derived integrated intensity , and the estimated contribution of the methanol line is well below the uncertainty of the mean of the fitted h@xmath0co  line . in the ne lobe , the methanol line appears to be about six times stronger , while the predicted h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission is comparable to that of the sw lobe . the noise level in the ne residual spectrum",
    "is slightly increased at the position of the subtracted blended lines . however , this is also the case at the position of the subtracted h@xmath0co(@xmath23 ) line and may be due to a deviation of the line profile from a gaussian shape .",
    "the result that the ch@xmath3oh(@xmath52 ) emission of the ne lobe is much stronger than that of the sw lobe agrees very well with the line strengths reported by @xcite .",
    "their intensities of the blended methanol lines at 97ghz and 157ghz are similar in both lobes .",
    "however , the ch@xmath3oh(@xmath146 ) transitions at 242ghz , which require high excitation levels similar to those needed to observe the ch@xmath3oh(@xmath52 ) transition , are stronger in the ne lobe than in the sw lobe , which might indicates a difference in excitation .",
    "1 .   we have detected several para - h@xmath0co  emission lines at 146ghz and 218ghz in both molecular lobes near the center of the nearby starburst galaxy m82 . to our knowledge",
    ", our study constitutes the first dedicated search for h@xmath0co  transitions with @xmath149 and the first detection of h@xmath0co(@xmath24 ) emission outside of the galactic neighborhood .",
    "2 .   our line ratio analysis using an lvg model with spherical cloud symmetry suggests the presence of warm ( @xmath2k ) , moderately dense ( @xmath1 ) molecular gas in the lobes near the center of the starburst activity .",
    "the ratio of column density to volume density and the small small - scale filling factor may indicate that the observed molecular gas forms large complexes of comparatively low - density molecular gas , possibly extended envelopes around a few remaining well - shielded cores .",
    "the physical properties of the molecular gas derived from our h@xmath0co   data are in very good agreement with parameters of the high - excitation component in the lobes of m82 found in recent comprehensive co studies , but differ from the results of a multi - line nh@xmath3 investigation .",
    "thus , the para - h@xmath0co  lines seem to trace the probably dominant high - excitation component of the molecular gas in m82 very well , while the nh@xmath3 emission might originate predominantly from cold cloud cores .",
    "the total mass of the molecular gas observed in the lobes is a few times @xmath150 , similar to the mass determinations of other molecular line studies .",
    "the selected para - h@xmath0co  transitions are good tracers of the molecular gas in starburst galaxies , even if a large fraction of the gas is in a warm phase ( @xmath136k ) of moderate density ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "we find strong evidence for ch@xmath3oh(@xmath52 ) emission in the spectrum of the ne lobe at 218ghz and also estimate the intensity of this emission line in the sw lobe .",
    "we thus confirm the detection of methanol in m82 by @xcite with measurements of another transition line that are consistent with the earlier findings .",
