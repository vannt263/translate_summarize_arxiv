    "the relative number and astrophysical properties of dwarf galaxies represent one of the major challenges to the widely accepted @xmath12+cold dark matter ( @xmath12cdm ) cosmological model of structure formation .",
    "for instance , the predicted number of dm haloes around a milky way ( mw)-sized halo exceeds the observed number by at least an order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and their central densities at a given mass are lower than inferred from simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "understanding these challenges has largely been left to studies of the local group ( lg ; with exceptions , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the faintest satellite galaxies can be discovered and studied in detail . however , a diversity of halo to halo substructure is expected due to varying accretion histories @xcite and inhomogeneous reionization @xcite ; it is also possible that the lg is an outlier in its satellite properties .",
    "a systematic study of the faint satellite populations of a large number of galaxies in a variety of environments is critical before the @xmath12cdm picture of galaxy formation can be confirmed .",
    "pioneering studies of faint satellite systems beyond the lg have begun .",
    "the m81 group of galaxies ( at @xmath1@xmath03.6 mpc ) has been the subject of a resolved stellar population search for satellites utilizing deep ground based imaging and _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) follow - up @xcite , finding satellites down to @xmath13 and largely confirming the faint satellite deficit with respect to @xmath12cdm seen in the lg .",
    "studies of unresolved low surface brightness satellites have additionally been undertaken for more distant groups ( e.g. , m101 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where dwarf galaxy distance measurements are still necessary to produce conclusive results .",
    "we have begun the panoramic imaging survey of centaurus and sculptor ( pisces ) to significantly increase the sample of massive galaxy halos with a complete census of satellites down to @xmath14@xmath0@xmath48  mag .",
    "pisces is focused on two nearby massive galaxies  the spiral ngc253 and the elliptical ngc5128/centaurusa ( cena ) , that reside in a loose group of galaxies ( sculptor ) and in a rich group ( cena ) , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "pisces will identify faint satellites and streams from resolved stellar light out to @xmath15@xmath0150  kpc in each system , allowing for direct comparison with the mw , the m31 pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ; * ? ? ? * ) and m81 @xcite .",
    "out of the planned survey area of @xmath16  deg@xmath10 , we have already collected data over @xmath17  deg@xmath10 around cena .    in this _ letter _ , we present the first results of our survey around cena : the discovery of a close pair of faint dwarf galaxies , likely associated with cena .",
    "the dwarfs were immediately visible in our pisces survey data and are located near cena s major axis in the north - east direction , at a projected distance of @xmath18  kpc . for the more luminous dwarf , a modest surface brightness enhancement can be recognized in archival digital sky survey images .",
    "in  [ sec : obs ] we describe our data and reduction procedure , while in  [ analysis ] we present the physical properties derived for the newly discovered dwarfs . in  [ concl ]",
    "we discuss the possibility of these dwarfs constituting a pair of galaxies and draw our conclusions .",
    "the data presented here were acquired on 2013 june 4 ( ut ) , as part of the pisces survey , with megacam @xcite at the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope , which has a @xmath024@xmath1924 field of view and a binned pixel scale of 016 .",
    "the seeing was excellent throughout the night , with a median of @xmath20 , and the conditions were photometric .",
    "the final stacked images had a total exposure time of @xmath21  sec for the @xmath22-band and @xmath23  sec for the @xmath24-band .",
    "initial data reduction ( image detrending , astrometry and stacking ) was performed by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory telescope data center , using a code developed by m. conroy , j. roll and b. mcleod .",
    "we perform point spread function ( psf)-fitting photometry on the final stacked images , adopting the suite of programs daophot and allframe @xcite .",
    "we construct a psf for each band selecting @xmath25 bright stars across the image .",
    "we then fit the psf to all objects @xmath26 above the background for each image , and compute the coordinate transformations between filters with daomatch / daomaster @xcite . finally , we perform simultaneous photometry of all the objects detected in both filters in order to obtain deeper catalogues .",
    "we only keep those objects satisfying the criteria @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the same night ,",
    "several equatorial sloan digital sky survey fields were observed at different airmasses to obtain zeropoints , color terms and extinction coefficients , and thus calibrate the instrumental magnitudes to the sdss system .",
    "stars have been individually corrected for galactic extinction @xcite , which has an average value of @xmath29@xmath00.15 .",
    "the photometric errors and incompleteness of our data have been computed via artificial star experiments .",
    "we have injected @xmath0@xmath30 fake stars with a uniform distribution on each of the stacked images , divided into 20 experiments in order not to increase the stellar crowding artificially .",
    "the fake stars cover the whole relevant range in color - magnitude space , and additionally reach @xmath31  mag ( @xmath02  mag fainter than the faintest real recovered stars ) . the same psf - fitting photometry procedure used for the real data has been performed on the fake stars .",
    "we find the overall ( color - averaged ) @xmath32 completeness limit to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that in the central @xmath01  arcmin of cena - mm - dw1 the crowding is higher than in the rest of the pointing , and the @xmath32 completeness limits correspond to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ cmds ] shows the dereddened color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for our newly found dwarfs , cena - mm - dw1 and cena - mm - dw2 .",
    "the error bars ( from the artificial star experiments ) show the typical magnitude and color uncertainty as a function of @xmath22-band magnitude , and the @xmath32 completeness limits ( for uncrowded regions ) are drawn .",
    "we begin this section by broadly discussing the stellar populations of our newly found dwarfs , and visualizing these new systems via red giant branch ( rgb ) stellar maps .",
    "we then discuss the distance , structure , metallicity and luminosity of this faint pair of cena dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ cmds ] shows our dereddened cmds where stars within the half light radius ( calculated in   [ sec : struct ] ) are plotted .",
    "the field cmds ( rescaled to the area of each dwarf ) in the right panels are from 3 rectangular regions with an area of @xmath37  deg@xmath10 each , two of which are located @xmath38  arcmin closer / further away than our targets along cena s major axis ( see figure  [ rgb_maps ] ) , and the third one located perpendicular to it , to the east of the two dwarfs .",
    "this choice is driven by the necessity of taking into account a possible density gradient and small - scale substructures in cena s halo .",
    "the field cmds show the main contaminants , i.e. galactic foreground ( almost vertical ) sequences at @xmath39@xmath00.5 and @xmath01.3 , unresolved background galaxies centered at @xmath39@xmath40 , and cena rgb halo stars ( sparsely populated at these large projected galactocentric distances , @xmath090 - 95  kpc ) .",
    "a prominent rgb is evident for both dwarfs .",
    "we plot the overall distribution of rgb stars in the megacam field in figure  [ rgb_maps ] , utilizing all stars from the red selection box in the cmds ( figure  [ cmds ] ) .",
    "these predominantly old stars are clearly clumped at the position of the dwarfs ( figure  [ rgb_maps ] , right panel ) .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of younger , main sequence stars : for cena - mm - dw2 , a @xmath01@xmath41 excess of blue sources can be seen at the center of the dwarf , but we do not consider this conclusive due to the strong background galaxy contamination .",
    "cena - mm - dw1 s cmd shows an overdensity of sources above the rgb with respect to foreground contaminants , which may be luminous asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "if real , they belong to an episode of star formation that occurred @xmath42  gyr ago .",
    "a more definitive assessment of the dwarfs star formation history will be forthcoming after planned hst observations of the pair .",
    "we derive the distance to the new dwarfs using the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) method , which utilizes the brightest , metal poor rgb stars as a standard candle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we employ a sobel edge detection filter to identify a sharp transition in the @xmath22-band luminosity function , with a color cut of @xmath43 in order to minimize contamination from foreground galactic stars ( at red colors ) and unresolved background galaxies ( bluer than the rgb ) .",
    "we find @xmath44 for cena - mm - dw1 and @xmath45 for cena - mm - dw2 , where the errors mainly depend on photometric uncertainties rather than the number of stars .",
    "these values correspond to distance moduli of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , once adopting a theoretically calibrated trgb absolute value of @xmath48 ( as computed in @xcite for sdss bands ) . as a test",
    ", we derive trgb distances for the adopted field regions , i.e. for stars belonging to cena s outer halo .",
    "we obtain @xmath49 , in excellent agreement with the average of literature values using several methodologies ( @xmath50 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the derived distances put the two dwarfs at roughly the same distance as cena , thus suggesting they are its satellites .",
    "follow - up hst data will be used to refine these distances and investigate the possibility that the two dwarfs form a physical pair ( see discussion in   [ concl ] ) .      to quantify the structure and luminosities of our new dwarf discoveries , we work with rgb stars from the selection boxes shown in figure  [ cmds ] .",
    "first , the dwarf centers are determined via an iterative process , computing the average of the stellar positions within circles of decreasing radius .",
    "from there , the position angle and ellipticity are measured using the method of moments for the rgb spatial distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the final values are reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for cena - mm - dw2 we only obtain upper limits on the ellipticity ( and thus have a poorly determined position angle ) because of the low number of available stars .",
    "we derive radial density profiles by counting the number of rgb stars in elliptical ( circular ) radii for cena - mm - dw1 ( cena - mm - dw2 ) .",
    "the field level is estimated from the average number of rgb stars present in our adopted field regions , and is entirely consistent with the number density for cena - mm - dw1 beyond @xmath51  arcmin .",
    "we subtract the field level from the derived radial profiles and correct them for incompleteness ( including a correction for the excess crowding incompleteness within @xmath52  arcmin of cena - mm - dw1 ) .    given the faint nature of these dwarfs , resolved rgb stars are necessary to trace their radial profiles as opposed to integrated light .",
    "however , we adopt the latter to convert the observed number density into proper surface brightness values . this can be done by performing integrated aperture photometry in the central regions of the dwarfs , and scaling the number density profile to the central surface brightness values ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the zeropoint between the two profiles is computed from their overlapping region , i.e. the innermost @xmath53  arcmin for cena - mm - dw1 and cena - mm - dw2 , respectively .",
    "the integrated light photometry is performed by summing up the flux within these apertures , subtracting the median sky level and applying zeropoint , color terms and airmass corrections ( sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the composite surface brightness profiles are shown in figure  [ sbprofs ] .",
    "note that we reach a remarkable surface brightness of @xmath54 mag / arcsec@xmath10 ( before field subtraction ) .",
    "srsic models are fit via least squares minimization to the composite surface brightness profiles ( figure  [ sbprofs ] ) , for datapoints within @xmath11  arcmin for cena - mm - dw1 and @xmath55  arcmin for cena - mm - dw2 . beyond these radii ,",
    "the profile of each dwarf is contaminated by the light of the other dwarf ( cena - mm - dw2 can be recognized as an enhancement in cena - mm - dw1 s profile at @xmath56  arcmin ) .",
    "the resulting parameters of the sersic profiles are reported in table  [ tab1 ] , and are consistent with being exponential profiles .",
    "the uncontaminated profiles trace out to @xmath57 times the derived half - light radii for the dwarfs .",
    "we derive their luminosities by integrating the best - fit srsic profiles , and obtain @xmath58 for cena - mm - dw1 and @xmath59 for cena - mm - dw2 ( uncertainties from error propagation ) . using the transformation between sdss and johnson - cousins filters reported by @xcite , the @xmath60-band total magnitudes of the dwarfs are @xmath5 for cena - mm - dw1 and @xmath6 for cena - mm - dw2 .",
    "the two dwarfs host relatively metal - poor stellar populations , as can be seen from the isochrones overplotted on the cmds in figure  [ cmds ] . to quantify this ,",
    "we use the standard method for computing photometric metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : we interpolate between solar - scaled isochrones with a fixed age of 12  gyr and [ fe / h ] varying from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , adopting the dartmouth stellar evolutionary database @xcite . a metallicity value is obtained for each individual rgb star with magnitude @xmath63 .",
    "the mean values we deduce are [ fe / h]@xmath64 for cena - mm - dw1 and [ fe / h]@xmath65 for cena - mm - dw2 ( as plotted in figure  [ cmds ] ) .",
    "the spread of the rgb is consistent with photometric errors , however we can not exclude an intrinsic range of metallicities for cena - mm - dw1 in particular .",
    "follow - up data will be crucial to assess the metallicity content of these dwarfs more precisely .",
    "we have presented the discovery of a faint pair of ( likely ) satellites of the elliptical galaxy cena , discovered within our pisces survey .",
    "cena - mm - dw1 and cena - mm - dw2 are located at a projected distance of 92  kpc from the center of their parent galaxy and lie at its approximate distance ( @xmath66  mpc ) , although the uncertainties call for deeper photometric follow - up .",
    "both dwarfs contain predominantly old ( @xmath012  gyr ) and metal - poor stellar populations ( [ fe / h]@xmath67 ) , while cena - mm - dw1 likely also contains intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "neither cena - mm - dw1 or cena - mm - dw2 are detected in the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with 3-@xmath41 upper mass limits of @xmath68 .    the derived structural and luminosity parameters of cena - mm - dw1 and cena - mm - dw2 ( table  [ tab1 ] )",
    "place them within the main locus defined by mw and m31 dwarfs with similar properties ( figure [ rhmv ] ) .",
    "of some note is the low central surface brightness of cena - mm - dw1 ( @xmath69  mag / arcsec@xmath10 ) , which lies at the edge of the m31 satellites distribution in a surface brightness versus luminosity plot .",
    "its properties are comparable to a few m31 satellites ( andxxiii , andxix , laci and casiii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with large half light radii ( @xmath70  kpc ) and unusually low central surface brightness ( @xmath71  mag / arcsec@xmath10 ) .",
    "no mw satellite shows such a low central surface brightness and large half light radius at the same time .",
    "it has been suggested that m31 companions with @xmath72 have lower surface brightness and are more extended with respect to mw companions with similar luminosity @xcite , although the inclusion of the latest results for the m31 subgroup have substantially decreased this difference @xcite .",
    "the new dwarfs distances are consistent with each other , and their very small angular separation ( 3  arcmin or 3.1  kpc at the distance of the dwarfs ) suggests we are looking at the first , faint satellite of a satellite in an external group of galaxies . according to simulations , groups of dwarfs infalling into the potential well of a giant host are common @xcite , although the predicted pairs of satellites ( with comparable luminosities ) are fewer than those observed in the lg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "examples of dwarf associations are present within the lg : the magellanic clouds , ngc147/ngc185 ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) , leo iv / leo v / crater ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) , and for all these pairs a common infall to the lg has been suggested @xcite .",
    "note that all the galaxies within these pairs display similar luminosities , while cena - mm - dw1 is @xmath73  mag brighter than cena - mm - dw2 . in some cases , stellar streams / overdensities with small angular separation are interpreted as dynamically associated structures , or even remnants of infalling groups onto the mw s halo , where the most massive of the dwarfs has already been disrupted ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath74 of faint dwarfs are likely to have fallen onto the mw as satellites of more massive dwarfs .    for some of the cited pairs , tidal perturbances / streams",
    "have been observed , even though their origin is still under discussion .",
    "intriguingly , cena - mm - dw2 lies only @xmath11  arcmin in projection away from its more massive companion and does not display clear signs of distortion , however the upper limit for its ellipticity ( @xmath75 ) is high , and possible substructures may be hiding at fainter magnitudes .",
    "we compute cena - mm - dw1 s tidal radius from a king profile , obtaining @xmath76  kpc , while its jacobi radius is @xmath77  kpc ( assuming @xmath78 , a projected radius from cena of 92  kpc and a cena mass of @xmath79 , @xcite ) , thus cena - mm - dw2 may be within its gravitational influence .",
    "the cmds derived from deeper hst imaging will allow for an improved rejection of background galaxies , and thus a more accurate investigation of cena - mm - dw2 s structural parameters and possible tidal distortions .",
    "if this speculation is confirmed , we might be looking at the last moments of cena - mm - dw2 before it is accreted by its more massive companion cena - mm - dw1 .",
