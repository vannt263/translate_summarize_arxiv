    "the leptonic decay , where @xmath3 , proceeds via an annihilation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks into a virtual @xmath6 boson with the radiation of a photon .",
    "leptonic decays can provide clean theoretical predictions of standard model ( sm ) parameters without the qcd - based uncertainties arising from hadrons in the final state .",
    "the purely leptonic decay @xmath7 , which offers a clean prediction of the @xmath0-meson decay constant @xmath8 , is helicity suppressed , having a branching fraction that is proportional to the square of the lepton mass . although the radiative mode is additionally suppressed by a factor @xmath9 , the presence of the photon can remove the helicity suppression by affecting the coupling of the spin-0 @xmath0 meson to the spin-1 @xmath10 boson , possibly through an intermediate off - shell state @xcite . the branching fraction of is predicted in the sm to be independent of the lepton type and of order @xmath11 , making it potentially accessible at current and future @xmath0 factories such as  and superb @xcite respectively .",
    "the most stringent published limits are from the cleo collaboration with @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the 90% confidence level ( cl ) @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction of the signal decay can be written as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fermi constant , @xmath16 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element describing the coupling of @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath0-meson mass and lifetime respectively , @xmath19 is the quark charge , and @xmath20 is the first inverse moment of the light - cone @xmath0-meson wave function .",
    "this last parameter plays an important role in proving qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "it also enters into calculations of the @xmath21 form factor at zero momentum transfer and the branching fractions of two - body hadronic @xmath0-meson decays such as @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , the latter being a benchmark channel for measuring the angle @xmath24 of the ckm unitarity triangle .",
    "typically assumed to be of order @xmath25 , at a few hundred mev , @xmath20 currently suffers from significant theoretical uncertainty @xcite . a measurement of ( )",
    "can provide a clean prediction of this important parameter .",
    "in addition , since is a possible background for @xmath7 , a measurement of ( ) over the full photon energy spectrum is needed for an accurate measurement of ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , which would improve predictions of @xmath8 .",
    "this analysis uses data taken from the  experiment @xcite , located at the asymmetric - energy @xmath26 storage rings at slac in california . on -",
    "peak data is produced by colliding electrons and positrons with a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy at the resonance of 10.58 gev , just above the threshold for production .",
    "we use the full  dataset of @xmath27 million @xmath0-meson pairs , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 423  .",
    "charged - particle momenta are measured using a tracking system comprised of a silicon vertex detector and drift chamber contained within the uniform magnetic field of a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "charged - particle identification is based on the energy loss in the tracking system and the cherenkov angle in a ring - imaging cherenkov detector .",
    "photon energies and electron identification are provided by a csi(tl ) scintillating electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "finally , muons are distinguished from hadrons using instrumentation embedded within the steel magnetic - flux return .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are used to model the detector response , determine the signal efficiency , and study the background .",
    "we present the first search for that uses an exclusive method , by fully reconstructing one @xmath0 meson ( ) via hadronic decay modes .",
    "unlike previous inclusive searches of , which identified the signal lepton and photon candidates before the recoiling @xmath0 meson , we reconstruct the recoil @xmath0 meson first before searching for the signal decay .",
    "although this technique results in a low signal efficiency ( 0.3% for signal modes ) , and thus more statistically - limited results , it compensates by providing a highly pure sample of @xmath0 mesons with comparatively little non-(continuum ) background . our reliance on poorly - modeled continuum background",
    "is thus reduced , which enables a search for that can avoid kinematic constraints in the signal selection .",
    "therefore , we present the first model - independent search of ( ) over the full kinematic range . in addition , by reconstructing the using only detectable hadronic decay modes , the missing four - vector of the otherwise undetectable signal neutrino is fully determined .",
    "the event selection begins by reconstructing a @xmath28 meson using various hadronic decay modes , listed in ref .",
    "additional charged tracks and neutral emc clusters are then combined with the @xmath28 seed to form the decay @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a combination of neutral and charged pions and/or kaons .",
    "@xmath30 is chosen such that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total energy of the @xmath26 system and @xmath33 is the candidate energy , both in the cm frame .",
    "if there exists more than one candidate , we choose the one with the @xmath28 and @xmath30 mode that provides the highest purity of well - reconstructed candidates .",
    "finally , we require that the candidate is charged .",
    "since the beam energy at pep - ii is accurately known within a few mev , we define the mass of the as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the three - momentum in the cm frame . since the candidate should have a mass consistent with the nominal @xmath0-meson mass , we require @xmath36 .",
    "the sideband region , defined as @xmath37 , is populated by combinatoric background , events coming from a @xmath38 or continuum decay in which the is incorrectly reconstructed . to improve the mc estimation of the reconstruction efficiency ,",
    "we normalize the mc that peaks within the signal region to the data that peaks within this same region , after applying the selection criteria . in addition , we reduce our reliance on the mc estimate of combinatoric events by estimating the non - peaking background directly from the data within the sideband .",
    "when a resonance decays to a pair , the two particles are almost at rest , with a momenta of about 350@xmath39 in the cm frame , since their masses are about half the mass .",
    "therefore , they tend to decay with an isotropically symmetric topology in the cm frame . on the other hand ,",
    "lighter @xmath40 and @xmath41 pairs , which are also produced in the @xmath26 interactions , have a higher momentum in the cm frame .",
    "their decays tend to have a more jet - like shape with a strongly - preferred direction characterizing the event , preferentially at small angles in relation to the beam axis . therefore , to achieve a higher purity of @xmath0 mesons",
    ", we use a multivariate selector of five event - shape variables to separate from continuum events .",
    "we require : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are probability density functions determined from mc that describe and continuum events , respectively , for the five event - shape variables @xmath45 .",
    "these variables , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , describe the sphericity of the event , the magnitude and directions of the thrust axes , and the direction of the momentum with respect to the beam axis .",
    "this requirement also suppresses the poorly - modeled continuum backgrounds which can contribute to discrepancies between the mc and data .",
    "after the reconstruction , we assign all the remaining charged tracks and neutral emc clusters , to the signal @xmath0 meson ( ) , as well as any missing momentum ( @xmath46 ) within the event .",
    "we require that has exactly one track , with a charge opposite that of the charge .",
    "in addition , this signal track must satisfy particle identification criteria of either an electron or muon and fail that of a kaon .    because high energy electrons can emit bremsstrahlung photons , we search for signal - side clusters that have proximity to the emc deposit of an electron candidate , both in @xmath47 , the angle from the beam axis , and in @xmath48 , the azimuthal angle around the beam axis . because the detector has a solenoid magnet through which all the particles travel , charged particles are bent in @xmath48 according to their charge , and therefore @xmath49",
    "is multiplied by the lepton candidate charge . any cluster with a momentum vector that is separated from that of the electron - identified signal track by @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "is identified as a bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "the energy of this cluster is then used to correct the four - vector of the signal track ( @xmath52 ) and is removed from the list of clusters .",
    "next , we identify the signal photon candidate , whose energy spectrum is expected to peak around 1  @xmath53 .",
    "we do this by searching through the remaining signal - side clusters for the one with the highest energy in the cm frame .",
    "although should only have one signal - side cluster if correctly reconstructed , extra clusters within an event can be due to fragments from particle showers , low - energy clusters from the , and/or noise in the detector such as beam - related photons . because of the presence of extra clusters , we apply the very loose requirement that there are no more than 11 additional low energy clusters which are not otherwise used in the or signal reconstruction .",
    "the total energy of these clusters is required to be less than 800@xmath54 , where we only include in this sum clusters which have lab - frame energy greater than @xmath55 .",
    "missing energy can be due to either an undetectable particle such as a neutrino or a detectable particle that travels outside of the fiducial acceptance of the detector . to suppress events of the latter category",
    ", we require that @xmath46 points within the fiducial acceptance of the detector .",
    "the lepton and neutrino are produced back - to - back by the virtual @xmath10 boson .",
    "however , in the rest frame , the angle @xmath56 between the signal track momentum and @xmath46 is affected by the release of the photon .",
    "therefore , we require @xmath57 in the frame recoiling from the photon .",
    "this frame is defined as the difference between the four - vector ( @xmath58 ) and the signal photon candidate four - vector ( @xmath59 ) . including this requirement assures that the decay is consistent with being a three - body decay , independent of when the photon was released .",
    "the most discriminating variable in this analysis is a requirement on the neutrino candidate s invariant mass , given by : @xmath60 this requirement isolates events in which the photon and lepton candidates are in kinematic agreement with a massless third daughter in the event .",
    "[ fig : numass ] shows that the signal peaks at zero , while the the background rises with .",
    "the tail on the signal distribution is larger for the electron mode than the muon mode due to unrecovered bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "the signal region for this variable is defined as @xmath61 for the electron ( muon ) mode .",
    "these values , as with all other cut values in this analysis , were optimized using the figure of merit @xmath62 @xcite , where @xmath63 , is the total signal efficiency , and @xmath64 is the number of expected background events .",
    "( dashed ) , and data ( points ) .",
    "events to the left of the vertical lines are selected .",
    "[ fig : numass],title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    ( dashed ) , and data ( points ) .",
    "events to the left of the vertical lines are selected .",
    "[ fig : numass],title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    the and @xmath65 requirements kinematically restrict the types of events that pass . since light @xmath66 mesons often decay to a pair of photons , where @xmath67 is a neutral meson containing a @xmath5-quark , the topology and kinematics of a event can often mimic that of the signal decay .",
    "this is particularly true if one photon is  missing \" such as through misreconstruction into the or due to a lab - frame energy that is too low to be detectable by the emc .",
    "thus , the primary background that passes the signal selection are events with a high energy photon . to suppress events in which both photon daughters are present in the signal - side clusters , we reject events in which the signal photon candidate can be combined with another cluster to form an invariant mass consistent with the or @xmath68 mass . to improve the purity of the reconstructed mesons , we only use clusters that are above a given energy @xmath69 in the rest frame .",
    "to suppress events , we reject events in which the invariant mass is between 120 and 145@xmath54with @xmath70 or between 100 and 160@xmath54with @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath68 particles are much more massive and thus tend to decay into higher energy photons , we suppress events by rejecting events with @xmath72 and an invariant mass between 515 and 570@xmath54 . finally , we suppress @xmath73\\ellp\\nul$ ] events by rejecting events in which the signal photon candidate combined with a candidate forms an invariant mass between 115 and 145@xmath54 .",
    "this candidate must have @xmath74 and an invariant mass between 115 and 145@xmath54 .",
    "events in which the two photons from a decay are merged into a single emc cluster can mimic the signal kinematics exactly , since the cluster chosen as the signal photon candidate contains the full energy of the .",
    "we suppress this background using a requirement on the cluster width of the signal photon candidate . a cluster that is the result of two merged photons from a decay tends to be wider than a cluster from a single photon .",
    "we require the lateral moment @xcite to be less than @xmath75 .",
    "we define the signal branching fraction for each lepton mode @xmath76 as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of observed data events within the signal region and @xmath79 is the number of @xmath80 mesons in the data sample .",
    "the branching fractions are computed using the frequentist formalism of feldman and cousins @xcite , with uncertainties on and modeled using gaussian distributions . since ( )",
    "is expected to be independent of the lepton type , we also combine the branching fractions of the two modes .",
    "the mc indicates that the selection criteria , especially the one track requirement and the and @xmath65 restrictions on the event kinematics , removes all decay types except events and the occasional combinatoric event from a misreconstructed .",
    "thus , we split into two categories : peaking events ( ) and combinatoric events ( ) .",
    "an event is considered peaking if it comes from a @xmath38 decay in which the is correctly reconstructed and hence peaks within the signal region . since only events peak in this region ,",
    "we improve the statistics of by using exclusive mc samples . for",
    ", we extrapolate the number of misreconstructed events in the signal region directly from the number of data events in the sideband .    the uncertainty on is dominated by the sideband data statistics , but it also includes a 14.6% systematic uncertainty on the combinatoric background shape .",
    "on the other hand , since and rely on the accuracy of the mc simulations , their uncertainties arise not only from mc statistics , but also include systematic uncertainties due to how well the mc agrees with the data .",
    "the contributions to the systematic uncertainties are listed in table [ tab : syssummary ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of is dominated by a 13.6% uncertainty in the branching fractions and form factors of various exclusive decays @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty due to the reconstruction , which also accounts for the uncertainty in @xmath81 , is determined by varying the shape and scaling of the combinatoric distribution .",
    ".contributions ( in percent ) to the systematic uncertainty on the branching fraction due to the signal efficiency and the peaking - background estimate .",
    "the ( ) source refers to branching fraction and form factor uncertainties in decays . [",
    "tab : syssummary ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the effective detector and particle identification thresholds are about 20@xmath54for photon energy and 400 ( 800)@xmath54for electron ( muon ) momentum , and we apply no minimum energy requirements .",
    "thus , this analysis is essentially valid over the full kinematic range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] .",
    "however , there exists theoretical uncertainty in the photon energy spectrum below @xmath82 for the decay .",
    "therefore , using certain theoretical techniques , the extraction of @xmath83 can be improved by including a minimum energy requirement on the signal photon @xcite .",
    "when the signal photon candidate energy is required to be greater than 1@xmath53 , we observe 2 ( 4 ) data events with @xmath84 in the electron ( muon ) mode .",
    "the , which is mostly uncorrelated with the photon energy spectrum , is reduced by 30% , resulting in a partial branching fraction of @xmath85 at 90% cl .",
    "the differential branching fraction versus photon energy @xmath86 of is given by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "the two form factors , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , describe the vector and axial - vector contributions , respectively , to the @xmath91 transition .",
    "although in some models @xcite and was assumed in the cleo measurement of ( ) , most models assert @xmath92 @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "we use signal mc that is generated based on the tree - level hadronic matrix element for as described by ref .",
    "@xcite , using a minimum photon energy of 350 mev .",
    "we use both form - factor models for our signal mc to evaluate the impact of the decay model on the signal selection efficiency and to ensure model - independency .",
    "we determine using the @xmath92 signal model , but because our analysis is independent of the decay kinematics , the @xmath93 model yields consistent values .",
    "we also determine branching fraction limits that are dependent on the signal model by introducing a kinematic requirement on the angles between the three daughter particles of the signal decay .",
    "we use the quantities @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the angle between the photon candidate and signal track momenta , and @xmath97 is the angle between the photon candidate momentum and @xmath46 , both in the rest frame . as seen in fig . [",
    "fig : angles ] , the photon is emitted preferentially back - to - back with the lepton in the @xmath92 model , and back - to - back with either the lepton or neutrino in the @xmath93 model .",
    "thus , we require @xmath98 or @xmath99 for the @xmath93 model , and only the former relationship for @xmath92 .",
    "this reduces in both modes and models by 40% .",
