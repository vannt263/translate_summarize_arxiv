    "much theoretical study has been made of the nature of the spin - glass transition .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the three - dimesional spin glass undergoes a second - order phase transition at finite temperature,@xcite and the bulk of the evidence in two dimensions is consistent with a zero - temperature phase transition,@xcite although recent work suggests that the lower critical dimension for some spin - glass models is greater than two.@xcite the continued controversy hints at the delicate and subtle nature of the spin - glass transition and suggests that modifications to the underlying model , even small ones , could have dramatic effects on the system .",
    "compressibility has already been shown to have a strong effect on a variety of spin systems .",
    "the inclusion of compressibility in the ising ferromagnet modifies the standard second - order transition to a first - order transition that occurs at the curie temperature.@xcite the ( fully frustrated ) 2-d triangular ising anti - ferromagnet does not undergo a phase transition ; however , when compressibility is added to the model , the characteristic frustration is relieved , and the system develops a first - order transition to a `` striped '' phase at low temperatures.@xcite other frustrated spin systems are known to have their frustration relieved by the presence of magnetoelastic couplings,@xcite and polaron effects alter the nature of magnetic transitions in frustrated physical systems such as manganites.@xcite    with the possibility of relieving frustration , the addition of compressibility to spin - glass models could dramatically alter the nature of the spin - glass phase and/or the transition thereto .",
    "furthermore , the fact that all physical systems must possess some ( albeit small ) spin - lattice coupling provides a physical motivation for such studies .",
    "a previous paper introduced a particular model for the compressible spin glass with a linear coupling between the spin - spin interactions and the distances between neighboring particles.@xcite the work described there involved simulations of the compressible spin glass performed on two - dimensional systems in which the volume was held fixed .",
    "results of the direct simulations suggest a simplified model , qualitatively equivalent to the first , that depends only upon spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the presence of compressibility alters the preferred spin configurations of the system , so that the transition to a low - temperature spin - glass phase is impossible above a critical value of the coupling .",
    "the current paper expands on that previous work as well as provides details of the analysis .",
    "presented here are results showing the exponential slowing down of the time to reach equilibrium as the coupling increases , additional quantitative motivation for the simplified model , and a functional form for the entropy of the spin glass , from which thermodynamic quantities are predicted .",
    "finally , a phase diagram illustrates an approximate boundary separating critical behavior from the region where the spin - glass transition can not exist .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec_model ] describes the hamiltonian of the compressible spin glass and defines the important tuning parameters .",
    "the details of the computer simulations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_details ] , and the results of the simulations are presented in sec .  [ sec_results ] . a simplified model is introduced in sec .  [ sec_simplified ] , along with results of numeric simulations and analytic investigations performed on the simplified model .",
    "section  [ sec_conclusion ] contains the primary conclusions and some additional points of discussion .",
    "the hamiltonian for the compressible ising spin glass is@xcite @xmath1    the first term is the standard edwards - anderson spin - glass hamiltonian,@xcite with the sum performed over pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "the spins @xmath2 are dynamic variables which may take the values @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the interactions @xmath5 are chosen randomly from @xmath6 with equal probability and are then held fixed ; this collection of interactions represents a single realization of the quenched disorder central to the nature of the spin glass .",
    "the coupling between the spin interactions and the lattice distortions is contained within the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eqn_csg_ham ] ) , where the coupling is considered to linear order with proportionality constant @xmath7 .",
    "this constant multiplies the change in bond length : @xmath8 represents the euclidean distance between particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the natural spacing of nearest neighbors on the lattice .",
    "this term allows the system to lower the total energy by displacing the particles from their regular lattice positions . spins with satisfied interactions ( i.e. , those with @xmath12 ) will tend to move closer together in order to strengthen the effect ; similarly",
    ", unsatisfied bonds will tend to lengthen as the particles move farther apart to diminish the negative effect of their interaction on the total energy .",
    "the inability of all of the bonds in the system to distort simultaneously in the ideal fashion is the mechanism by which the degeneracy of configurations with equal spin - spin energy is broken .",
    "the final term , @xmath13 , stabilizes the lattice by providing a restoring force to counteract the displacements generated by the spin - lattice interactions .",
    "the stabilization is obtained by connecting harmonic springs between nearest neighbors and between next - nearest neighbors ( along the diagonals of the square lattice ) .",
    "each spring has as its unstretched length the natural spacing of the vertices , so that @xmath13 is zero in the absence of spin - lattice coupling when the particles are not displaced .",
    "two important parameters can be formed .",
    "the first arises due to force balance between the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_csg_ham ] ) : @xmath14 this has dimensions of length and represents the scale of the typical displacements of the particles from their uncoupled locations on the square lattice .",
    "the second parameter is @xmath15 which is dimensionless ; it represents the strength of the spin - lattice coupling , relative to the spin - spin interaction . when @xmath16 , there is no spin - lattice coupling , lattice distortions are not energetically favorable , and the model reduces to the standard edwards - anderson spin glass .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath17 serves merely to set the energy scale for the model . in this work , @xmath17 is set to unity , while @xmath7 and @xmath18 are chosen so that @xmath19 and @xmath0 take the desired values .",
    "all simulations were run on square lattices of linear dimension @xmath20 with periodic boundary conditions in two dimensions ; the size of the system was held constant in each direction , fixing the total volume .",
    "the control parameters were adjusted so that @xmath19 was set at ten percent of the natural lattice spacing while @xmath0 was varied over the range @xmath21 . since the information regarding relative energy scales is contained within @xmath0",
    ", the specific value of @xmath19 does not affect the qualitative nature of the results , so long as the displacements are small enough to maintain the topology of the lattice . as discussed below , however , small nonlinearities do depend on the extent of the lattice distortions .    for all values of the control parameters ,",
    "100 different bond configurations ( i.e. , realizations of the quenched disorder ) were simulated .",
    "calculated quantities were then averaged over the various runs .",
    "two different methods of simulation were used to study the compressible spin glass . for the first method ,",
    "suitable for studying the dynamics of the model , states were generated via single - spinflip monte carlo steps , with transition probabilities dependent upon the difference in energy between the two spin states .",
    "these energies employed the full hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqn_csg_ham ] ) , including the components that depend on the particle positions . for purposes of determining transition probabilities ,",
    "the spins were considered to flip in place , i.e. , without any particle motion .",
    "the lattice was then relaxed for the new spin configuration .",
    "the full simulation algorithm is as follows : the system is started in a random spin configuration with the particles located at the positions which minimize the total energy . from a given spin configuration ,",
    "a particle is chosen at random .",
    "this particle is given a chance to flip , in place , from the state with energy @xmath22 to the state with energy @xmath23 . if @xmath24 the spin is flipped ; otherwise the spin flips with probability @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "after @xmath26 randomly chosen particles have been considered ( i.e. , one monte carlo step ) , the lattice is relaxed to the minimum of the potential energy for the new spin configuration using conjugate - gradient minimization .",
    "system properties are recorded for analysis , and this process is then repeated .    in order to ensure proper equilibration , i follow the algorithm prescribed by bhatt and young:@xcite the spin - glass susceptibility @xmath27 where @xmath28 indicates a thermal ( time ) average , is calculated by two different methods , each as a function of equilibration time @xmath29 .",
    "one method uses the overlap between states of the same system at two different times during the run , while the other uses the overlap between states of two randomly initialized , independently run replicas of the same bond realization .",
    "these two computation methods produce the same value of @xmath30 as @xmath31 , but the `` two - times '' method approaches the asymptotic value from above , while the `` two - replicas '' method approaches from below .",
    "when the two values are within statistical error of one another , the system is equilibrated .",
    "the simulations are typically run for several multiples of the equilibration time in order to acquire data from uncorrelated portions of the time evolution .",
    "another method of simulation , suitable for studying static properties such as the energy , involves substituting a collection of pre - generated spin states into the compressible spin - glass hamiltonian and relaxing each to the minimum of its total energy with respect to the particle positions .",
    "typically , the spin states are generated by single - spinflip monte carlo simulations using the standard ( incompressible ) spin - glass hamiltonian , which takes much less time than simulations of the full hamiltonian as described above . in this manner",
    ", `` typical '' states may be analyzed to observe the effect of the compressible terms on quantities of interest ; however , these states will not occur with frequency given by the correct boltzmann weight , so care must be taken not to draw conclusions that would rely on such an assumption .",
    "for the smallest system sizes ( @xmath32 , 4 , and 5 ) , it was possible to enumerate all @xmath33 possible spin states for a given bond configuration .    for all methods of generating spin states , the lattice was relaxed to its minimum using the conjugate - gradient minimization technique.@xcite since the distortions of the lattice are kept small by the value of @xmath19 , the potential - energy landscape is close to quadratic , and the minimum can typically be located to reasonable numerical tolerance within a few conjugate gradient steps .",
    "nevertheless , because of the computation involved in calculating the lattice energy , this portion of the simulation takes approximately two orders of magnitude more time than the monte carlo spinflips .",
    "simulations of the two - dimensional , constant - volume compressible ising spin glass were performed for system sizes ranging from @xmath32 to 40 using the techniques described above .",
    "data from these simulations are presented and anlayzed below .",
    "the time required for the system to reach thermal equilibrium is an easily accessible measure of the timescale for the system dynamics . for each value of @xmath0 , a different equilibration time",
    "is required , and fig .",
    "[ fig_equil_time ] shows the dependence of the equilibration time , @xmath29 , on @xmath0 for the @xmath34 systems at a relatively high temperature , @xmath35 .",
    "as the fit line on the semilog plot demonstrates , the growth of the equilibration time , in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , is exponential in @xmath0 ; the slope of the exponential fit is @xmath36 .",
    "the rapid growth of the equilibration time as the coupling is increased can be viewed as a growth of energy barriers between states that were previously similar in energy .",
    "the movement of particles `` locks in '' the current spin configuration , increasing the timescale for single - spinflip transitions .    , grows exponentially as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the data here are from 100 @xmath34 systems at @xmath35 , and the slope of the exponential fit line is @xmath36 . the dramatic increase of simulation time makes straightforward simulation of the dynamics difficult for large values of the coupling . ]",
    "the growth of the equilibration time as a function of the coupling is in addition to the usual dramatic growth of dynamic timescales as the temperature is lowered ( see , for example , fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "since the number of simulation steps required increases exponentially with @xmath0 and the computation time per step increases in a manner proportional to the number of spins , direct simulations of the system dynamics at temperatures approaching the transition become prohibitive for large values of the coupling .      in analyzing the results of the simulations ,",
