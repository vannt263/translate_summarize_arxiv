    "the relation between giant planets and planetesimal belts is still uncertain .",
    "@xcite find that the incidence and brightness of cool outer - system debris is not affected by the presence or absence of gas giants in the system , which is not surprising if the formation and evolution of giant planets at a few au and comets at tens of au are decoupled processes .",
    "more subtle effects may occur , such as the clearing out of comet belts when giant planets migrate , analagous to the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) era in solar system history .",
    "this could result in brief dusty episodes as more planetesimals collide , and subsequent lower dust levels due to the ejection of many comets from the system . however , such lhb events seem to be atypical , as spitzer has commonly found old star systems that are still very dusty @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the incidence of giant planet and debris systems , and the weak overlap between them , could be explained if the mass of refractory elements at the planet - formation stage controlled the outcome .",
    "young circumstellar discs with a large ` solid ' mass could quickly form planet cores that go on to accrete gas atmospheres , while less substantial discs only form planetesimals by the time the gas disperses and so evolve into debris systems .",
    "this model ( see also @xcite ) addresses the differing metallicity dependences observed  metal - rich discs tend to have a higher solid mass and so a greater probability for building a planet core , while lower solid reservoirs are needed to build comets and so debris has little dependence on metallicity @xcite .",

    "about half the stars were not detected at all at 70  @xmath4 m .",
    "this is mainly attributable to larger distances of rare thick disc objects compared to thin disc stars .",

    "the fraction of thick disc stars where only excesses above three times the photosphere can be detected ( i.e. bins from 301 - 350  % upwards ) is rather large . in the general stellar surveys ,",
    "the sensitivity attained was generally better than this ( light blue bins ) .",

    "it was noted that some stars have 70  @xmath4 m fluxes well _ below _ the photospheric prediction , although with large errors .",
    "since the mips calibration is reliable over a wide range of fluxes @xcite , we considered whether the stars could be under - bright for reasons related to metallicity .",

    "aperture photometry gives a mean flux of @xmath12  mjy , consistent with minimal debris given the mean 70  @xmath4 m photospheric flux of 5.2  mjy .",
    "a better estimate of the net cool dust within the whole thick disc sample can be found from a weighted average of the 70  @xmath4 m excesses ( table  2 ) .",
    "we define e70  =  r70 - 1 and weight the values by 1/error@xmath13 , where the error in e70 can be written as e70/@xmath1470 .",
    "the net excess for the 19 stars with 70  @xmath4 m data is @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16  % above the photosphere at the 1-sigma upper bound .",
    "this result is however dominated by five stars with low - noise data . for a stellar effective temperature of around 5600  k and dust peaking in brightness at 70  @xmath4 m , i.e. of temperature around 50  k , an excess of @xmath17  % gives an upper limit on fractional dust luminosity @xmath18 of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "approximately 80  % of nearby sun - like stars are also dust - free at this level individually @xcite . hence",
    ", if the thin and thick disc populations have similar debris incidence and levels , the null result here for only 19 stars is not surprising . in more detail , the expected number of debris detections at 70  @xmath4 m can be estimated from figure  1 , taking into account the limiting depths of the thick disc data .",
    "the number of detection per 50%-wide excess bin is then the fraction in the general ( t+b ) surveys , scaled to 19 stars , and multiplied by the fraction of thick disc targets where such an excess was detectable .",
    "this yields a cumulative 2.1 expected detections , with a poisson error of @xmath20 , so finding no debris systems is within the errors .",
    "similarly , there is a 5  % incidence of 24  @xmath4 m excess for sun - like stars in general @xcite , so finding none among 22 stars here is consistent with similar populations . studying trends by age , @xcite found a 24  @xmath4 m debris - incidence of approximately @xmath21  % at 3 - 10  gyr . in theoretical models , some slow fading is predicted , with fractional dust luminosity decreasing e.g. by 25  % by 11  gyr compared to typical mid - age galactic systems at about 5  gyr @xcite .",
    "statistics are ultimately limited by the small numbers of thick disc stars actually passing through the solar vicinity at the present time , and in our volume - limited sample we have already searched for debris among the nearest 15 , or 70  % , of objects catalogued by @xcite .",
    "fainter levels of debris or cooler dust may be accessible to the herschel satellite , now observing at wavelengths of 70 to 500  @xmath4 m .",
    "the debris incidence in the thick disc is either low or normal ; we can rule out a particularly _ high _ incidence of excess in these metal - poor systems .",
    "recent theoretical work by @xcite has suggested that low - metal systems could have late planetesimal formation as the gas disc is dispersed , in which case more collisional debris might have been expected around the thick disc stars , but this is not seen here . in contrast , some thick disc stars do host giant planets  an outcome thought to reflect more efficient planetesimal - building at early stages . in our sample hd  114729",
    "has a gas giant @xcite , and four other good planet - candidates exist for thick disc stars @xcite .",
    "the m sini of these planets range from 0.5 to 7 jupiter masses and the semi - major axes from 0.15 to 2  au .",
    "[ fig4 ]     figure  4 shows the predictions of our model @xcite based on the mass of solids available at the planet(esimal ) formation stage .",
    "the model is based on a threshold of solid material needed for a successful outcome such as building a gas giant core , and with the solid mass within the disc scaling by the metal fraction in common with the star .",
    "the @xmath22 distribution is obtained by multiplying the log - normal distribution of overall disc masses @xcite by the log - normal distribution [ fe / h ] for the population of interest , here with mean and standard deviation of -0.6 and 0.2 respectively .",
    "the thresholds for forming detectable debris discs and gas giants are around 0.02 and 0.1 jupiter masses in solids respectively @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we neglect systems with both planets and debris , since the two phenomena appear uncorrelated @xcite , and so this is a small subset of sun - like stars .",
    "figure  4 then predicts that 15  % of thick disc stars should form giant planets , with a further 9  % forming comet belts . around the general local population of sun - like stars ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are 21  % and 20  % .",
    "the differences are modest because the availability of solid material is largely dictated by the total disc masses , which have a very broad distribution of @xmath23  dex , compared to the standard deviations around 0.2 dex for the metallicities .",
    "hence , while the peaks of the solid - mass distributions do shift for differing metals ( figure  4 ) , the upper tails associated with forming planet(esimals ) are broad and do not have greatly different numbers of stars .",
    "these values are compatible with survey data , taking into account that not all systems of planets and debris have yet been discovered . in the general stellar population ,",
    "the extrapolated planet total is 17 - 20  % @xcite and the debris disc count at 70  @xmath4 m is around 14 - 20  % @xcite , which agree well with the predictions of 21 and 20  % respectively . for the thick disc stars ,",
    "the debris incidence is @xmath24  % versus the 9  % predicted , and the planet count is estimated at @xmath25  % , versus 15  % predicted .",
    "it has been noted that lower - metal discs may disperse faster @xcite , and this could reduce the efficiency of growing planet(esimals ) compared to our simple model .",
    "the thick disc planet frequency is poorly known , with our 6  % estimate derived from three planetary systems among 52 thick disc objects that have [ fe / h ]  @xmath26 and [ @xmath27/fe ]  @xmath28 @xcite , while the 11  % is for two out of 18 systems in the fe , mg - selected , volume - limited , thick disc sample of @xcite .",
    "these planet frequencies are actually _ higher _ than for low - metal stars in general , such as the incidence of 1  % for periods of less than three years found in a recent survey by @xcite . conditions that could promote the formation of more gas giants in the old thick disc population compared to younger low - metal thin disc stars are at present unclear .",
    "while the scarcity of nearby thick disc stars makes it difficult to study the population , there are examples of disc and planet systems around some comparably old stars .",
    "a gas giant is known around the post main sequence star v391 peg of age @xmath29  gyr @xcite ; the @xmath30  gyr - old g8 v star @xmath31  ceti has a debris disc @xcite ; and the oldest known star with both a planet and debris is 70  vir at @xmath32  gyr @xcite .",
    "these discoveries point to some of the first stars in the galaxy having had the potential to form planetary systems akin to those around typical stars seen today .",
    "if some thick disc stars have minimal cool debris but do host gas giants orbiting at a few au , these would be analogues to the solar system formed many gyr before the sun .",
