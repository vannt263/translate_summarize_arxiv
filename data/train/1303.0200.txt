    "the increasing precision on the experimental determination of the dark matter ( dm ) density , which is expected to be further improved by the data from the planck satellite , has brought a renewed interest in the impact of radiative corrections to the annihilation cross section of dark matter candidates of particle nature .",
    "particles with weak interaction strength and masses around the tev scale that dropped out of thermal equilibrium in the early universe yield the correct order of magnitude for the relic density .",
    "an example of the latter is provided by the lightest neutralino of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , perhaps the most promising candidate for such weakly interacting dark matter .",
    "the potential to set stringent constraints on the parameter space of the mssm using the high precision measurements of the dark matter density crucially depends on having an accurate calculation of the neutralino relic abundance .",
    "a necessary input for this calculation is the annihilation cross section of the lightest neutralino , and of all possible co - annihilation processes .",
    "while programs exist that provide the tree - level results numerically  @xcite , at the one - loop level such calculations are not available for a generic mssm model , although they have been performed for some scenarios  @xcite , or under certain approximations  @xcite .",
    "there is however a certain class of radiative corrections where higher - order loop diagrams contributing to the dm annihilation amplitude are not necessarily suppressed . at the temperatures where freeze - out of the relic particle abundance takes place , the dark matter particles are non - relativistic , with typical velocities of order @xmath6 .",
    "quantum loop corrections due to the exchange of light particles between the non - relativistic dm particles before annihilation can become more and more important in situations where the force coupling strength is larger than the dm velocity and the mass of the force carrier is much lighter than the dm mass , eventually requiring a resummation of the terms in the perturbative expansion to all loop orders . this phenomenon has been termed as `` sommerfeld effect '' , and can lead to a significant enhancement of the dm annihilation rates , also of relevance for the calculation of primary decay spectra in the present universe . in the mssm , sommerfeld corrections may constitute the dominant radiative correction when the lightest neutralino is much heavier than the electroweak gauge bosons and the yukawa potential generated by their exchange becomes long - range . for such heavy neutralinos mixing effects are suppressed by @xmath7 ) and thus mass degeneracies arise in the neutralino - chargino sector , making necessary to account for co - annihilation processes in the relic density calculation .",
    "two prominent examples of this scenario are the mssm wino- and higgsino - limit , for which the impact of the sommerfeld effect has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the tree - level dm annihilation cross section can be expanded in the relative velocity @xmath8 of the two annihilating particles ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 for non - relativistic @xmath8 . in a previous work @xcite ( referred to as paper i in the following ) the calculation of the leading - order coefficient @xmath11 in ( [ eq : sigmav ] ) was presented in analytic form for the general mssm with neutralino lsp , including results for all co - annihilation processes with nearly mass - degenerate neutralinos and charginos . in this paper",
    "we complete the calculation by providing analytic results for the subleading term in this expansion , the coefficient @xmath12 . in the non - relativistic effective theory ( eft ) framework",
    "devised in paper i , the coefficients @xmath13 account for the short - distance part of the neutralino and chargino pair - annihilation processes and are written as a combination of the absorptive parts of wilson coefficients of local four - fermion operators .",
    "the absorptive part of the eft matrix element of these four - fermion operators then gives the full neutralino and chargino pair - annihilation rates , including the long - range sommerfeld effect .",
    "while the leading - order term @xmath11 in ( [ eq : sigmav ] ) receives contributions only from @xmath14-wave annihilations , the subleading term @xmath12 encodes both @xmath14- and @xmath0-wave annihilation contributions , which we provide separately .",
    "this is required for a correct implementation of the sommerfeld correction factors , that depend on the spin and partial - wave configuration of the annihilating state . in recent literature which addresses the sommerfeld effect including the @xmath15 terms in the annihilation cross section , only the @xmath0-wave contributions to the coefficient @xmath12",
    "have been computed approximately using numerical routines at the amplitude level  @xcite , or it has been assumed that @xmath12 is entirely @xmath0-wave  @xcite .    the results presented in i ( and complemented in this work ) also extend those from previous approaches in another relevant aspect .",
    "the knowledge of the tree - level annihilation cross section ( [ eq : sigmav ] ) for all nearly mass - degenerate neutralino and chargino two - particle states is not sufficient for the calculation of the sommerfeld corrected ( co-)annihilation rates .",
    "as described in paper i , a contribution to the full annihilation rate of an incoming @xmath16 state is given by the imaginary part of the amplitude for the process @xmath17 where the transitions among the @xmath18 states are mediated by long - range potential interactions and the short - distance annihilation into sm and light higgs particles ( @xmath19 ) involves the two - particle states @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the case when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are different states corresponds to an off - diagonal short - distance annihilation rate . in our eft approach the diagonal and the off - diagonal ( tree - level ) short - distance rates",
    "are encoded in the absorptive part of local four - fermion operators wilson coefficients , that are obtained from matching the eft tree - level matrix elements of the four - fermion operators to the absorptive part of the hard ( 1-loop ) mssm amplitudes for the @xmath22 scattering reactions .",
    "the off - diagonal terms have not been taken into account in the sommerfeld - enhanced neutralino relic abundance calculations aside from the wino- and higgsino - limits @xcite , and their implementation using the numerical packages that provide the tree - level annihilation rates has not yet been attempted .",
    "in contrast , the analytic results presented in this work allow for a systematic treatment of all diagonal and off - diagonal short - distance annihilation rates at next - to - next - to - leading order in the non - relativistic expansion in sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation reactions .",
    "the contents of this paper are the following : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basis ] we briefly review the effective lagrangian framework introduced in paper i and recollect the essential notation .",

    "the expressions for the ( rather lengthy ) next - to - next - to - leading @xmath14-wave wilson coefficients are collected in a mathematica package attached to this paper  @xcite , which also includes the @xmath0-wave kinematic factors and those from the leading - order operators that were written explicitly in the appendix of paper i. appendix  [ sec : appendixsuppl ] explains the notation used in this electronic supplement . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gammarate ] we generalise the formula for the tree - level annihilation rates to the case of off - diagonal annihilation processes , which is needed in order to analyse the size of next - to - next - to - leading corrections in an off - diagonal transition used as a case example in sec .

    "[ sec : results ] also discusses three selected ( diagonal ) processes where the role of the next - to - next - to - leading corrections from our analytic calculation of the annihilation cross section is markedly different . through these examples",
    "we illustrate the importance of separating the different partial - wave contributions to the short - distance annihilation for the computation of the sommerfeld - corrected cross sections .",
    "our results for the diagonal annihilation rates for these examples are checked against the corresponding unexpanded cross sections computed with a numerical code . to serve as an example of how to use the results presented in this work , we have included in appendix  [ sec : appendixexample ] a step - by - step calculation of the non - relativistic @xmath23 annihilation cross section including up to @xmath24 effects for the case of pure - wino neutralino dark matter .",
