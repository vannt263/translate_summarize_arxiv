    "the recent construction and commissioning of the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider has led to a renewed interest in the properties of heavy nuclei in recent years .",
    "a considerable amount of fruitful work has been done on classical and semiclassical descriptions of the physics involved . in particular , the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model@xcite provides a framework for calculating the gluon distribution functions for very large nuclei at very small values of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 .",
    "what mclerran and venugopalan realized is that at sufficiently small @xmath0 , the gluons are unable to resolve the longitudinal structure of the nucleus , meaning that many quarks contribute to the color field at each value of the ( transverse ) position @xmath1 .",
    "this large charge per unit area @xmath2 provides the scale at which the strong coupling is evaluated@xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath3 , a classical treatment ought to provide a reasonable description .",
    "recently , we pointed out that the infrared divergences which appear in the mv model may be cured by incorporating the effects of confinement@xcite .",

    ", we expect that there should not be long range ( @xmath5 ) correlations between quarks .",
    "strong correlations between quarks occur only when we probe at short distance scales .",
    "these considerations may be phrased as a mathematical constraint on the form of the two - point charge density correlation function .",
    "the calculations presented in refs .  @xcite all assume @xmath0 to be small enough so that the gluons do not probe the longitudinal structure of the lorentz - contracted nucleus which they see . effectively , then , the relevant geometry is two - dimensional , with the source exactly on the light cone . in this work",
    "we extend the mv model to larger values of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 . in this regime ,",
    "the gluons begin to resolve the longitudinal structure of the nucleus : therefore , we develop a fully three - dimensional framework using a source that is not quite aligned with the light cone . in order to deal with the complications which arise as a result",
