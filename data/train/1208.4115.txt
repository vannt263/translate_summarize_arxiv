    "the realization that we have crossed a technology threshold that allows transiting planets to be detected sparked a flurry of activity in this direction after the historic detection of hd  209458  b s transits @xcite .",
    "this has resulted in an enormous expansion of exoplanetary science such that we can now explore the mass - radius relationship @xcite and atmospheres @xcite of planets outside of our solar system .",
    "most of the known transiting planets were discovered using the transit method , but some were later found to transit after first being detected using the radial velocity technique .",
    "two notable examples are hd  17156  b @xcite and hd  80606  b @xcite , both of which are in particularly eccentric orbits . other radial velocity planets are being followed up at predicted transit times @xcite by the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) .",
    "planets in eccentric orbits are particularly interesting because of their enhanced transit probabilities @xcite .",
    "this orbital eccentricity also makes those planets prone to orbital precession . in celestial mechanics , there are several kinds of precession which can affect the orbital properties , spin rotation , and equatorial plane of a planet .",
    "these have been studied in detail in reference to known transiting planets , particularly in the context of the precession effects on transit times and duration @xcite .",
    "one consequence of these precession effects is that a planet that exhibits visible transits now may not do so at a different epoch and vice versa .    here",
    "we present a study of some precession effects on known exoplanets .",
    "the aspect which sets this apart from previous studies is that we are primarily interested in planets not currently known to transit , particularly long - period eccentric planets which have enhanced transit probabilities and larger precession effects .",
    "we investigate the subsequent rate of change of the transit probability to show how they drift in and out of a transiting orientation .",
    "we calculate the timescales and rates of change for the precession and subsequent transit probabilities and discuss implications for the timescales on which radial velocity planets will enter into a transiting configuration , based upon assumptions regarding their orbital inclinations .",
    "we finally compare periastron argument uncertainties to the expected precession timescales and suggest orbital refinement as a means to measure this effect .",
    "here we briefly describe the fundamentals of the geometric transit probability for both circular and eccentric orbits . for a detailed description",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in the case of a circular orbit , the geometric transit probability is defined as follows @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the semi - major axis and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the radii of the planet and host star respectively .",
    "more generally , both the transit and eclipse probabilities are inversely proportional to the star ",
    "planet separation where the planet passes the star - observer plane that is perpendicular to the plane of the planetary orbit .",
    "planet separation as a function of orbital eccentricity @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the true anomaly , which describes the location of the planet in its orbit , and so is a time dependent variable as the planet orbits the star .",
    "for a transit event to occur the condition of @xmath7 must be fulfilled @xcite , where @xmath8 is the argument of periastron , and so we evaluate the above equations with this condition in place . the geometric transit probability may thus be re - expressed as @xmath9 which is valid for any orbital eccentricity . note that these equations are independent of the true inclination of the planet s orbital plane .     from current to @xmath10 results in a transit probability improvement @xmath11%",
    ", a vertical arrow indicates the improvement.,width=309 ]    given the sensitivity of transit probability to the argument of periastron , it is useful to assess how the probabilities for the known exoplanets would alter if their orientation was that most favorable for transit detection : @xmath12 .",
    "we extracted data from the exoplanet data explorer @xcite which include the orbital parameters and host star properties for 592 planets and are current as of 30th june 2012 .",
    "for each planet , we calculate transit probabilities for two cases : ( 1 ) using the current value of @xmath8 , and ( 2 ) using @xmath13 .",
    "the transit probabilities for case ( 1 ) are shown in figure [ tranprobfig ] . those planets whose case ( 2 ) probabilities",
    "are improved by @xmath11% are indicated by a vertical arrow to the improved probability .",
    "there are several features of note in this figure .",
    "the relatively high transit probabilities between 100 and 1000 days are due to giant host stars whose large radii dominates the probabilities ( see equation [ tranprobeqn ] ) ) .",
    "there are several cases of substantially improved transit probability , most particularly hd  80606  b , which is labelled in the figure .",
    "the following sections investigate the periastron precession required to produce such an increase in transit probability .",
    "periastron ( or apsidal ) precession is the gradual rotation of the major axis which joins the orbital apsides within the orbital plane .",
    "the result of this precession is that the argument of periastron becomes a time dependent quantity .",
    "there are a variety of factors which can lead to periastron precession , such as general relativity ( gr ) , stellar quadrupole moments , mutual star ",
    "planet tidal deformations , and perturbations from other planets @xcite . for mercury ,",
    "the perihelion precession rate due to general relativistic effects is 43@xmath14/century ( 0.0119@xmath15/century ) . by comparison ,",
    "the precession due to perturbations from the other solar system planets is 532@xmath14/century ( 0.148@xmath15/century ) while the oblateness of the sun ( quadrupole moment ) causes a negligible contribution of 0.025@xmath14/century ( 0.000007@xmath15/century ) @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the formalism of @xcite in evaluating the amplitude of the periastron precession .",
    "we first define the orbital angular frequency as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the mass of the host star , and @xmath19 is the orbital period of the planet .",
    "the total periastron precession is the sum of the individual effects as follows @xmath20 where the precession components consist of the precession due to gr , stellar quadrupole moment , tidal deformations , and planetary perturbations respectively .",
    "@xcite conveniently express these components in units of degrees per century .",
    "the components of @xmath21 and @xmath22 have @xmath23 and @xmath24 dependencies respectively . since we are mostly concerned with long - period planets in single - planet systems , we consider here only the precession due to general relativity since this is the dominant component in such cases .",
    "this imposes a lower limit on the total precession of the system , particularly for multi - planet systems .",
    "this precession is given by the following equation @xmath25 with units in degrees per century .",
    "to examine this precession effect for the known exoplanets , we use the data extracted from the exoplanet data explorer , described in section [ tranprob ] .",
    "the gr precession rates for these planets are shown in figure [ eccprec ] as a function of eccentricity , where the radius of the point for each planet is logarithmically scaled with the orbital period . as a solar system example , the precession rate for mercury is shown using the appropriate symbol .",
    "there are two distinct populations apparent in figure [ eccprec ] for which the divide occurs at a periastron precession of @xmath26/century .",
    "it is no coincidence that this divide corresponds to the known relative dearth of planets in the semi - major axis range of 0.10.6  au @xcite .        as expected from equation [ grprec ] , the amplitude of the precession is dominated by the orbital period rather than the orbital eccentricity .",
    "thus , even planets in eccentric orbits do not exhibit significant gr precession at longer periods .",
    "this is further demonstrated in figure [ eccperiod ] where we show lines of constant precession as a function of period and eccentricity for a solar - mass host star .",
    "this shows that the gr periastron precession is almost independent of orbital eccentricity except at extreme values of @xmath27 .",
    "once again , the location of mercury on the plot is indicated using the appropriate symbol .    ) . the symbol for mercury",
    "is used to indicate its position on the plot.,width=309 ]    as noted by @xcite and @xcite , the total precession time scales are large . thus what really matters is the rate of change of the periastron argument and quantifying when it is worth returning to a particular target for re - investigation .",
    "this is the context of our analysis in section [ transit ] .      for completeness",
    ", we briefly consider the effects of nodal precession .",
    "nodal precession occurs when the orbital plane precesses around the total angular momentum vector , which is usually aligned with the rotation axis of the host star .",
    "the precession is caused by the oblateness of the star which results in a non - zero gravitational quadropole field .",
    "this has the potential to be the dominant source of precession when the orbit is polar .",
    "for example , the nodal precession for the near - polar retrograde orbit of wasp-33  b has been calculated by @xcite to be @xmath28 times larger than that induced on the orbit of mercury by the oblateness of the sun .    a description of nodal precession and its effect on transit durations has been provided by @xcite .",
    "the frequency of nodal precession can be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the orbital angular frequency described in equation [ angfreq ] , @xmath31 is the quadrupole moment , and @xmath32 is the orbital inclination relative to the stellar equatorial plane . a typical quadrupole moment for the star may be approximated as @xmath33 and one may expect a relatively aligned orbit such that @xmath34 . for a typical hot jupiter ,",
    "values for @xmath1 are @xmath35 , whereas for mercury @xmath36 .",
    "since the nodal precession is in units of the orbital angular frequency , one can see that the resulting precession rate is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than that of a hot jupiter , even at the orbital distance of mercury .",
    "this effect is generally only considered for circular orbits , most notably for short - period orbits that are the most frequently encountered nature of known transiting planets . here",
    ", we are considering longer period eccentric orbits where this is a much smaller effect on the orbital dynamics of the planet .",
    "as discussed in section [ tranprob ] , the transit probability for a given planet is a function of the periastron argument for orbits with non - zero eccentricity @xcite .",
    "the precession of the periastron argument thus leads to a cyclic change in the transit probability . here",
    "we quantify this cyclic behaviour and determine rates of change and total timescales .",
    "using the periastron precession rates calculated in section [ precession ] and combining these with the transit probability equations of section [ tranprob ] allows us to compute the time dependent transit probability for each planet .",
    "recall also that this cyclic behaviour will only occur for planets which have non - zero eccentricities . shown in figure [ cyclicplot ]",
    "are three examples of this time dependence over a period of 100,000 years .",
    "when viewing such a plot one is tempted to interpret the cyclic variability in terms of the orbital period , however this variation is caused by the periastron precession , not the orbital period .",
    "there is , of course , some period dependency involved , in that shorter period orbits will tend to have a higher cyclic frequency .",
    "the planets shown here ( hd  88133  b , hd  108147  b , and hd  190360  c ) have orbital periods of 3.4 , 10.9 , and 17.1 days respectively @xcite .",
    "hd  108147  b , in particular , displays very large amplitude variations due to the relatively high eccentricity of its orbit ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "hd  190360  c has a smaller eccentricity and periastron precession rate , which leads to a cyclic timescale much greater than 100,000 years .",
    "we have performed these calculations for a subset of the known exoplanets using the data extracted from the exoplanet data explorer , described in section [ tranprob ] .",
    "we restrict our sample to those planets which are not known to transit and have non - zero eccentricities .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in table [ cyclictable ] for 60 of the planets .",
    "the calculated values include the periastron precession rate ( @xmath38 ) , transit probability ( @xmath39 ) , maximum transit probability at @xmath12 ( @xmath40 ) , time from the current epoch until maximum transit probability ( @xmath41 ) , and the transit probability rate of change ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the table has been sorted according to @xmath42 which is presented in units of % /century .",
    "the @xmath42 values have been calculated from the current epoch over the coming century and thus represents the present rate of change .",
    "the importance of this is that @xmath42 is not constant and indeed can have negative values as the periastron argument rotates past @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , @xmath42 will be negative for @xmath43 and positive elsewhere .",
    "this further restricts the planets considered to those whose current @xmath8 falls in this range such that @xmath44 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the time required to reach maximum transit probability is immense , certainly beyond the lifetime of anyone reading this work .",
    "however , the rate of change can yield an improved idea of which planets may have a measurable change in configuration .",
    "consider the case of hd  156846  b , whose orbital parameters and transit potential have been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "this is one of the planets in the table with the longest period and also has one of the highest orbital eccentricities .",
    "the transit probability is relatively high for this planet and is close to the maximum probability since @xmath8 only needs to change by @xmath45 .",
    "even so , observations of the periastron precession are unlikely for the timescales involved . by contrast , the hot saturn hd  88133  b discovered by @xcite has the highest transit probability rate of change .",

    "a program of refining the orbits of the known exoplanets , such as that described by @xcite , would result in many of these precession effects to be detectable in reasonable time frames .",
    "for example the first planet in the table , hd  88133  b , has a precession rate that will cause a shift of @xmath48 per decade .",
    "uncertainties on @xmath8 of less than one degree are not unsual and can certainly be achieved for those planets in particularly eccentric orbits .",
    "the exoplanet hd  156846  b has a current @xmath8 uncertainty of @xmath49 @xcite which demonstrates that such refinement is possible even for relatively long - period planets .",
    "more data and longer time baselines will produce subsequent improvements for many more planets which can result in the detection of the precession for high - precession cases .",
    "the relevance of this work may be extended to the kepler mission which has detected many candidate multi - planet systems @xcite , most of which are likely to be real exoplanets @xcite .",
    "due to simply geometric transit probabilities , most of these systems will certainly have planets which are not transiting the host star at present .",
    "the known transiting multi - planet systems are largely in circular orbits , but may have periastron precession due to perturbations from other planets leading to an eventual transit from currently non - transiting planets in the system .",
    "for example , kepler-19  c is known to exist from transit timing variations of the inner planet , but does not currently have a detectable transit signature .",
    "similarly , some of these planets will cease exhibiting an observable transit signature .",
    "issues such as these are important for considering the completeness of these surveys in determining multi - planetary system architectures .",
    "the authors would like to thank david ciardi and solange ramirez for several useful discussions and the numerous people who have requested that we perform this study .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee , whose comments greatly improved the quality of the paper .",
    "jh gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the australian government through arc grant dp0774000 . this research has made use of the exoplanet orbit database and the exoplanet data explorer at exoplanets.org .",
    "this research has also made use of the nasa exoplanet archive , which is operated by the california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration under the exoplanet exploration program .",
