    "galactic open clusters occupy a wide range of ages , sizes , locations in the galaxy , initial mass functions , and metallicities , and are found throughout the galactic disk .",
    "thus , open clusters are excellent tracers of galactic disk properties and give insight into the formation of the disk @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the fundamental properties of open clusters are difficult to determine .",
    "current estimates of these properties vary widely ; there is only marginal agreement in the literature about the age , metallicity , reddening , or galactocentric distance of any given open cluster .",
    "part of the disparity between estimates is due to the variety of methods used to determine these quantities .",
    "the published metallicity estimates of an open cluster are especially prone to disagreement because each technique has different sensitivities to metallicity patterns , and it is likely that none of the methods , with the possible exception of high - resolution spectroscopy , commonly used to estimate stellar metallicity is measuring the `` true '' metallicity of the stars . additionally , the relationship between the many different techniques is often unknown .",
    "the past few decades have yielded significant advances in the study of open clusters , but there is still much work to be done toward determining the fundamental properties of the more than 1500 currently known galactic open clusters .    nonetheless , open clusters are extremely useful objects to study because each cluster represents a homogeneous set of stars .",
    "all stars in an open cluster form at the same time and in the same circumstances , and thus are expected to have the same age , metallicity , and galactocentric distance .",
    "for this reason , open clusters are good testbeds for many types of galactic studies . for example",
    ", they may be ideal objects in which to search for extra - solar planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , open clusters can be metal - rich objects .",
    "metal - rich environments have recently received attention due to the suggestion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that extra - solar planets form more readily around metal - rich stars",
    ". if this is the case , metal - rich open clusters may be excellent places to search for extra - solar planets .",
    "this is the primary motivation for this work ; planet searches will be conducted in metal - rich open clusters identified in this study .",
    "these programs will be carried out by the survey for transiting extrasolar planets in stellar systems ( stepss ) program ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper",
    "we present new , accurate metallicity estimates for seven open clusters that were presumed to be metal - rich based on literature searches .",
    "we have obtained moderate resolution spectroscopy of giants in the target - clusters and use spectrophotometric line indices to produce metallicity estimates for the target - clusters .",
    "in this work we follow the method of @xcite to determine metallicities using spectrophotometric line indices as proxies for high - resolution metallicity estimates .",
    "this procedure was adopted in several subsequent papers , including @xcite , @xcite , and most recently @xcite . here",
    "we quantitatively assess the precision of this methodology , which is described below .",
    "the target - clusters were selected as a precursor to a search for extra - solar planets .",
    "clusters to be observed were chosen on the basis of a high metallicity estimate cited in the literature , as well as their location in the galaxy .",
    "we used the @xcite database to select target - clusters , with selection criteria of [ fe / h ] @xmath7 so as not to exclude metal - rich clusters with large errors in their metallicity determination .",
    "we required the target - clusters to have distances @xmath8 300 pc , so that the stars would be bright enough to observe on our 2-m class telescopes , and to have declinations @xmath9 ( 1950 ) @xmath10 , so as to be observable from the northern hemisphere .",
    "we did not put any constraints on the ages of the clusters ; indeed , the selected open clusters span a wide range of ages .",
    "these criteria yielded a set of 26 candidate open clusters .",
    "these target - clusters were observed with the mdm `` echelle '' ccd imager at the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope of the mdm observatory in a preliminary observing run . during this run",
    "we obtained images of the target - clusters as well as instrumental color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of each cluster .",
    "we use these images and instrumental cmds to select target - cluster stars .    using these preparatory images , we further required the selected open clusters to be optically distinguishable as a cluster in the 1.3 m images ( the imager has a 17field of view ) .",
    "this constraint ensures a large number of observable stars , both in the clump ( for this work ) and in the cluster in general ( for use in the planet searches ) .",
    "the clusters were also explicitly required to have several giant stars in or near the clump , based on the instrumental cmd , in order to determine accurately the metallicity of each target - cluster .",
    "the seven target - clusters selected from these criteria are ngc 1245 , ngc 2099 , ngc 2324 , ngc 2539 , ngc 2682 , ngc 6705 , and ngc 6819 .",
    "we select giants with @xmath11 ( typically red clump giants ) in each of the target - clusters . for reference , the names of the stars in each target - cluster used here are those given in the webda open cluster database . we also give the references for the identifications for each cluster in  [ sec : metal ]    we also observed stars of known metallicity to use as calibrators .",
    "we took calibration stars mainly from the survey of @xcite , who presents a large sample of bright field stars and cluster giants with accompanying measured indices and previously derived metallicities .",
    "we took bright metal - poor calibration stars from @xcite , while additional giant stars from the old open cluster ngc 2682 were taken from @xcite . in order to minimize calibration errors between target - cluster stars and the calibrators , we selected calibration stars from these papers that have a color of @xmath12 mag , roughly the same ( dereddened ) color as the target - cluster stars . additionally , we observed a few calibration stars with @xmath13 , in order to ensure some overlap with the color of the target - cluster stars .",
    "the spectral data were obtained at the mdm observatory using the ccds spectrograph .",
    "we obtained one night of data ( 2002 january 31 ) on the 2.4 m hiltner telescope , while the other seven nights of data ( during 2002 march 21 - april 01 ) were obtained on the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range 3800 - 5400   with the 350 l / mm ( 1.33  / pix ) grating .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of an unresolved emission line is @xmath143 pixels , yielding a spectral resolution ( @xmath15/@xmath16 of @xmath141150 .",
    "all spectra on both telescopes use an 87 @xmath17 slit for uniformity .",
    "this slit size translates to 1  on the 2.4 m and 18 on the 1.3 m. most spectra have formal signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) 100 per pixel .    we observed the target - cluster stars interspersed with calibration stars of known metallicity .",
    "thirty - five observations of 33 target - cluster stars and 56 observations of 38 calibration stars were made .",
    "figures [ fig : f1 ]  [ fig : f7 ] show the reduced spectra of all of the stars observed in each target - cluster .",
    "figure [ fig : f8 ] shows a selected sample of the calibration stars observed .",
    "multiple observations of some stars were included in order to ensure reproduction of friel s method , to check repeatability of the measurements between telescopes , and also to have many measurements on which to base the calibration .",
    "we reduced the data using standard iraf routines following the usual practice of overscan subtraction , division by a flat field , and extraction of the spectra .",
    "flat fields and comparison lamp spectra were obtained using lamps within the instrument .",
    "we correct the spectra for atmospheric extinction using the standard kpno ( kitt peak ) extinction curves provided by iraf .",
    "on each night we observed a spectrophotometric standard star from @xcite .",
    "the application of only one standard per night ( regardless of the airmass of the observations ) may introduce a small color effect into the spectra since the airmass has a color term and we do nothing to account for the airmass of the observations . due to the nature of the measurements ( indices with continuum bands on either side of the lines ) , this is not a significant concern .",
    "no attempt was made to do spectrophotometry , i.e. , we did not align the slit with the parallactic angle at each telescope pointing .",
    "this seems to have had little effect on our results .",
    "several recent papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use spectrophotometric indices as an estimator for the metallicity and other properties of individual stars .",
    "the indices are measured for both the program stars as well as calibration stars with well - known metallicity ; the calibration star data are fit to obtain a calibration for the metallicities of the target - cluster stars .",
    "this practice is desirable because the indices may be measured with moderate resolution spectra to obtain a relatively accurate ( i.e. , generally good to @xmath14 0.15 dex ) metallicity estimate for the star , and obviates the need for difficult - to - obtain high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "lick indices @xcite are commonly used in this technique and are applied to extragalactic sources for which it is often impossible to obtain high s / n , high - resolution spectra . @xcite",
    "slightly altered the lick indices to account for differences between galactic and extragalactic sources and applied them to giant stars in the galaxy .",
    "the indices are defined as a ratio between a bandpass that incorporates several strong metal lines and continuum measurements on either side of this bandpass that include little flux from metal lines .",
    "the final measured indices ( several per star ) may then be combined to yield a metallicity estimate for each star .",
    "for example , the fe4680 index is defined as    @xmath18    the line and continuum regions of the indices used in this work are given in table [ table : table1 ] , as well as the species measured by each index .",
    "this table is reproduced from @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : f9 ] shows a sample moderate resolution spectrum obtained on the mdm 2.4 m telescope .",
    "the central bandpasses of each measured index are shown across the bottom of the figure .",
    "figure [ fig : f10 ] shows an enlarged section of the same spectrum , showing the central bandpass and accompanying continuum bandpasses for the fe4680 index .",
    "although the calibration stars are selected from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , many of these stars have more recent metallicity estimates than those cited in these original references . in order to minimize errors introduced into our analysis from the calibration stars , we selected only field giants from @xcite that had metallicity estimates from a single source . specifically , we chose metallicity estimates from the @xcite ( hereafter cds ) catalog .",
    "this catalog is a compilation of previously published atmospheric parameters determined from high - resolution , high s / n spectra from a variety of sources .",
    "the 2001 version of the catalog contains bright f , g , and k stars in the galactic field as well as in certain associations .",
    "we selected thirty - eight metallicity standards from @xcite that had at least one metallicity determination in the cds catalog ; we obtained 56 measurements of these 38 stars .    for stars with more than one entry in the cds catalog",
    "we combine the available entries as follows . if there are two entries we average the two quoted metallicities . for stars with three or more entries , we discard metallicity measurements more than one standard deviation away from the median of all the measurements .",
    "we then average the remaining measurements . when only one measurement was present in the catalog , we adopt it .",
    "many of the entries in cds do not have associated error estimates ; those that do are of order 0.1 dex .",
    "we estimate errors by finding the standard deviation of the remaining metallicities once spurious measurements are discarded as described above . for stars with only one or two measurements , or those for which only two measurements remained , we assume an error of 0.1 dex .",
    "however , this may be an overestimate of these errors , as our method reproduces metallicities of most of these field stars to higher precision ( see  [ sec : fit ] ) .",
    "table [ table : table2 ] gives the measured indices of the calibration stars observed in this work along with their @xmath19 mag and @xmath20 colors ( from the hipparcos catalog , * ? ? ? * ) and metallicities ( derived from the cds database , as described above ) . table [ table : table3 ] shows these data for the target - cluster stars .",
    "we obtained all of the spectra with the ccds spectrometer , and we made most of the observations with the mdm 1.3 m telescope . since all measurements were obtained with the same instrument , we do not expect large systematic differences between the data obtained on each telescope .",
    "several stars were observed on both of the mdm observatory telescopes .",
    "we compared the indices for the stars observed on both telescopes ; the results are shown in table  [ table : table4 ] .",
    "the average difference between the target - cluster stars measured on the two telescopes is 0.00 and the standard deviation between the stars measured on each telescope is 0.03 .",
    "this difference is well within the errors of the measurements and suggests no systematic difference in the indices measured on the two telescopes .",
    "we also observed some stars twice on the 1.3 m run .",
    "we compare the indices for the stars observed twice on the 1.3 m run , as well as the indices of the stars observed multiple times over both runs .",
    "no stars were observed twice on the 2.4 m run .",
    "the results are again shown in table  [ table : table4 ] .",
    "note that in both cases the average difference between any two measurements is 0.00 .",
    "the standard deviation for the stars measured twice during the 1.3 m run is 0.04 while that for all stars measured twice ( over both runs ) is 0.03 .",
    "finally , we compare our measured indices for the calibration stars to those given in @xcite .",
    "for all of the stars that were measured both by @xcite and in this work , we found the difference between friel s value of each index and ours and computed the average and standard deviation for all of the indices .",
    "our indices reproduce friel s well ; the average difference of the indices is @xmath21 and the standard deviation is 0.054 .      in order to determine quantitatively if the interstellar reddening to the target - clusters affects our results , we simulated the effects of reddening on a sample spectrum .",
    "we used iraf utilities to redden artificially the spectra and measured the effect of reddening on each of the indices .",
    "we applied an e(b - v ) of 1.0 ( much more extreme than any of the target - clusters should actually have ; see footnotes to table [ table : table3 ] ) , and re - calculated the index values .",
    "for some indices the difference in the index between the raw spectrum and the dereddened spectrum was higher than the others ( ca4226 and g - band were 0.05 and 0.11 respectively ) . for the remaining nine indices the difference was 0.03 or less ( roughly the precision of the index measurements ) .",
    "however , none of the target - clusters have nearly this high of a reddening value ( see the footnotes to table [ table : table3 ] ) . at the approximate reddening values applicable to our target - clusters ,",
    "the effect of reddening was well below the other sources of error .",
    "we conclude that reddening does not significantly affect our results .",
    "we begin by writing the predicted metallicity as a linear function of the 11 observed spectrophotometric line indices @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24}_{\\rm pred } = \\sum_{i=0}^{11 } a_i f_i$ ] , where @xmath25 .",
    "we determine the coefficients @xmath26 by making a linear fit to 56 stars that have spectroscopically determined metallicities from cds of [ fe / h]@xmath27 .",
    "we determine which of these 11 spectrophotometric line indices are redundant as follows . in the fit",
    "we arbitrarily assign each index an error of unity .",
    "since there are @xmath28 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , the resulting @xmath29dof of the fit gives the ( square of the ) scatter about the fit .",
    "we then try removing each of the 12 parameters in succession and find the parameter that causes @xmath0 to increase by the least . since the number of dof has also increased ( by 1 ) , the @xmath29dof may have increased or decreased .",
    "if it has decreased , we regard the parameter as redundant , remove it , and then try removing each of the remaining 11 parameters .",
    "we continue this process until @xmath29dof begins to increase .",
    "we derive the metallicities of the target - clusters using the 56 calibrator stars .",
    "we find that the target - cluster stars all have [ fe / h]@xmath30 .",
    "further , we find that thirteen calibrator stars have extremely high scatter in this fit ( @xmath310.15 ) , possibly due to large errors in their cds metallicity determinations .",
    "we therefore repeat the entire procedure but restricted to the sample of 43 calibrator star measurements that have [ fe / h]@xmath30 , discarding the high - scatter stars . in this case",
    ", we find 5 indices are removed ( fe4530 , fe5011 , mg , fe5270 , fe5335 ) . the equation used to combine the indices and produce the metallicities of the stars is    @xmath32= } \\\\ & & -3.180415 + 4.398434\\times\\mbox{fe4065}+1.105911\\times\\mbox{cn4216 } + \\\\ & & \\nonumber-2.480848\\times\\mbox{ca4226}+-0.725162\\times\\mbox{g - band } + \\\\ & & \\nonumber2.835423\\times\\mbox{fe4680 } + -1.620898\\times\\mbox{fe4920}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the coefficients of the indices are also presented in table  [ table : table5 ] .",
    "the scatter about the relation is @xmath33 .",
    "this number reflects the quadrature sum of the root - mean - square ( rms ) error in the spectroscopic metallicities and the intrinsic scatter of the method .",
    "even though the target - cluster giants are selected to have approximately the same @xmath20 color as the calibration stars , we find that the derived metallicities of the target - cluster giants have a non - negligible dependence on color .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that some of the stars we observed were not in the red giant clump but rather were more evolved stars on the giant branch .",
    "thus these stars have different surface temperatures and gravities than the rest of our clump stars .",
    "this effect is readily calibrated by removing the color dependence of the metallicity .",
    "we compare metallicity residual ( relative to cds metallicity ) to @xmath20 color for the five calibrator stars and five target - cluster stars in ngc 2682 ( the target - cluster with the most well - determined metallicity in the literature ) .",
    "the @xmath20 colors of these stars are dereddened using e(b - v)=0.05 @xcite .",
    "for the five program giants ( with no literature metallicity values ) we assume the average literature value for the cluster metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath34 .",
    "the equation of the fit is    @xmath35_{cds } - [ m / h]_{this paper } = 1.4937\\times(b - v ) - 1.5858.\\ ] ]    the derived color correction is then applied to the 35 target - cluster stars individually to obtain the final metallicity of each star .",
    "we assume that the spread in ages of the target - clusters has a negligible effect on this fit .",
    "more explicitly , we assume the errors associated with this assumption are smaller than our other sources of error .",
    "the data and the derived fit are shown in figure [ fig : f11 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : f12 ] compares our derived metallicities ( after applying the color correction ) to those of cds .",
    "the scatter in this relation is @xmath140.08 dex , which is only 0.01 dex larger than the scatter in the derivation of the original relation .",
    "we therefore estimate the overall error in the method to be @xmath140.08 dex .",
    "this implies that the technique of applying a color correction to the derived metallicities produces acceptable results .",
    "note that we use the term [ m / h ] to refer to our metallicity estimates .",
    "since each of the spectrophotometric line indices is selected to incorporate several metal absorption lines , our method must measure some aspect of the star s metallicity .",
    "but since the indices comprise several different metal species , this method does not necessarily measure only the iron abundance of the star .",
    "table [ table : table6 ] shows the metallicities determined for each of the target - cluster stars , the mean metallicities of each target - cluster , and the scatter in the target - cluster star metallicities .",
    "we report the error for each target - cluster as the error in the mean of the target - cluster giant stars : the error in the method ( 0.08 dex ) divided by the square root of the number of giant stars measured in each target - cluster .",
    "note that our method differs in a significant way from previous papers using spectrophotometric line indices to derive metallicities : we combine all of the measured indices at once using @xmath0 analysis , whereas others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use each index individually to derive a metallicity for each star , then average the derived metallicities together .",
    "our analysis indicates that several of the indices provide no additional sensitivity to metallicity for the stars in our sample , and we do not use them at all .",
    "below we discuss the application of our fit to each target - cluster individually and compare the derived metallicity to existing values in the literature .",
    "most of the open clusters studied here do not have a large number of previous metallicity determinations .",
    "a new catalog of open clusters @xcite improves upon and replaces the @xcite database and includes metallicity estimates for all of our target - clusters .",
    "although the on - line catalog does not include references for the metallicity estimates of the clusters , dias ( 2005 , private communication ) has provided the references used in the catalog .",
    "we cite the references given to us by dias for each of the clusters in the discussion below .",
    "ngc 1245 has a metallicity of [ m / h]=@xmath360.04 derived from seven measurements of six stars .",
    "the scatter in the derived metallicities is 0.09 dex , close to what we expect based on the error in the method .",

    "it was selected as the first of several clusters for a targeted transiting planet search by the stepss program .",
    "paper i reports a metallicity for ngc 1245 of [ fe / h]=@xmath6 0.03 ( statistical ) @xmath1 0.08 ( systematic ) . this value is derived from detailed isochrone fitting , using a @xmath0 fit to accurate photometric observations to derive physical parameters of the cluster and quantifying the systematic errors in the method .",
    "this method yields perhaps the most reliable derivation of cluster parameters of any of those referred to below , with the possible exception of the high - resolution spectroscopy determinations .",
    "it should be noted that in  3.1 of paper i a best - fit value of the total - to - selective extinction @xmath37=2.3 is derived , yielding a metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath38 .",

    "we use moderate - resolution spectroscopy to estimate metallicities of giants in these clusters , calibrating our results with high - resolution metallicity determinations of field giants .",
    "we reproduce the high - resolution determinations to 0.08 dex .",
    "our derived metallicities generally agree with those found in the literature ; more importantly , we provide new metallicity estimates for several clusters that are not well studied .",
    "this method is of interest because it requires little observing time , relatively small telescopes , and the results are arrived at quickly compared to more complicated methods ( such as those used in paper i ) .",
    "this method is also more robust than many photometric techniques , as it relies on quantitative spectroscopy and relative index measurements , not on the generally unpredictable photometricity of the night sky .",
    "we have demonstrated that it reproduces the metallicities of calibration stars of known metallicity well .",
    "the measured indices are easily reproducible on different telescopes and even , as evidenced by comparison of our indices to the published indices of @xcite , by different instruments and observers .",
