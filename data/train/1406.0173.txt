    "in inverse synthetic aperture radar ( isar ) a high resolution image of a target is obtained by using the two - dimensional fourier transform of the received ( and processed ) signal .",
    "the isar image of a point target is a highly concentrated two - dimensional pulse function at a point whose position corresponds to the target s range and cross - range . for a number of reflecting points",
    ", the radar image consists of several pulses at the range and cross - positions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "usually the number ( area ) of nonzero values in the isar image is small as compared to the total number of signal samples .",
    "thus , we may say that the common signal in isar is sparse in the two - dimensional fourier domain @xcite . as such it can be reconstructed from much fewer samples than the sampling theorem requires .",
    "unavailable , randomly position samples could also result from heavily corrupted parts of the signal , that are omitted and declared as unavailable , before the isar image recovery and calculation is done @xcite . in the signal recovery",
    "the fact that the two - dimensional fourier transform domain is the domain of radar signal sparsity is used .",
    "this fact allows the application of the compressive sensing methods @xcite .",
    "a  simple method for the unavailable radar signal data recovery and the isar image calculation is reviewed in the paper .",
    "an analysis of the noise influence on this radar image is done .",
    "a simple and accurate formula for the output signal - to - noise ratio is derived .    for fast maneuvering isar targets",
    ", the radar image can be spread over the two - dimensional fourier transform domain @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "then a large number of the two - dimensional fourier transform values are nonzero , covering a large part of the radar image . in this case the sparsity property of the signal is lost .",
    "one possibility to restore this property is to use parametric transforms to compensate and refocus the isar image , making it sparse again @xcite .",
    "however , a large number of parameters should be used for almost each reflecting point in the case of a general nonuniform motion .",
    "good results can be achieved using these techniques , but at the expense of a high computational load .",
    "this kind of parametric calculation is even more complex for the reduced set of available signal samples , when the compressive sensing methods are going to be used .",
    "the other way to refocus the image is based on the quadratic time - frequency representations @xcite . a representation which can achieve high concentration , like in the wigner distribution case , at the same time avoiding the cross - terms , is the s - method .",
    "this method is nonparametric and computationally quite simple .",
    "it requires just a few additional additions and multiplications on the already calculated  isar image using the two - dimensional fourier transform @xcite .",
    "however , the s - method relation to the signal is not linear .",
    "therefore , many conventional compressive sensing based recovery techniques , including the one reviewed in this paper , can not be used .",
    "they are based on the direct linear reconstruction relation between the signal and the transform in the domain of signal sparsity .",
    "this is not the case in the quadratic signal representations , such as the s - method .",
    "it was the reason why the recently proposed gradient method for the signal samples recovery @xcite is adapted for the problem formulation in this paper .",
    "this method does not require a direct linear relation of the signal and its sparsity transformation domain in the process of recovery of unavailable signal values .",
    "the presented methods and results are illustrated and tested on several numerical examples proving the expected efficiency and improvements .",
