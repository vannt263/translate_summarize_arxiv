    "the discovery of lorentz symmetry was one of the great advances in the history of physics .",
    "this symmetry has been confirmed to ever greater precision , and it powerfully constrains theories in a way that has proved instrumental in discovering new laws of physics .",
    "moreover the mathematical structure of the lorentz group is compellingly simple .",
    "it is natural to assume under these circumstances that lorentz invariance is a symmetry of nature up to arbitrary boosts .",
    "nevertheless , there are several reasons to question exact lorentz symmetry . from a purely logical point of view , the most compelling reason is that an infinite volume of the lorentz group is ( and will always be ) experimentally untested since , unlike the rotation group , the lorentz group is non - compact .",
    "why should we assume that _ exact _ lorentz invariance holds when this hypothesis can not even in principle be tested ?    while non - compactness may be a logically compelling reason to question lorentz symmetry , it is by itself not very encouraging . however , there are also several reasons to suspect that there will be a failure of lorentz symmetry at some energy or boost .",
    "one reason is the ultraviolet divergences of quantum field theory , which are a direct consequence of the assumption that the spectrum of field degrees of freedom is boost invariant .",
    "another reason comes from quantum gravity .",
    "profound difficulties associated with the `` problem of time '' in quantum gravity  @xcite have suggested that an underlying preferred time may be necessary to make sense of this physics , and general arguments suggest radical departures from standard spacetime symmetries at the planck scale  @xcite . aside from general issues of principle ,",
    "specific hints of lorentz violation have come from tentative calculations in various approaches to quantum gravity : string theory tensor vevs  @xcite , cosmologically varying moduli  @xcite , spacetime foam  @xcite , semiclassical spin - network calculations in loop qg  @xcite , non - commutative geometry  @xcite , some brane - world backgrounds  @xcite , and condensed matter analogues of  emergent gravity \"  @xcite .",
    "none of the above reasons amount to a convincing argument that lorentz symmetry breaking is a feature of quantum gravity . however , taken together they do motivate the effort to characterize possible observable consequences of lv and to strengthen observational bounds . moreover , apart from any theoretical motivation , significant improvement of the precision with which fundamental symmetries are tested is always desirable .",
    "the study of the possibility of lorentz violation is not new , although it has recently received more attention because of both the theoretical ideas just mentioned and improvements in observational sensitivity and reach that allow even planck suppressed lorentz violation to be detected ( see e.g.  @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "a partial list of such  windows on quantum gravity \" is    * sidereal variation of lv couplings as the lab moves with respect to a preferred frame or directions * cosmological variation of couplings * cumulative effects : long baseline dispersion and vacuum birefringence ( e.g.  of signals from gamma ray bursts , active galactic nuclei , pulsars , galaxies ) * new threshold reactions ( e.g.  photon decay , vacuum erenkov effect ) * shifted existing threshold reactions ( e.g.  photon annihilation from blazars , gzk reaction ) * lv induced decays not characterized by a threshold ( e.g.  decay of a particle from one helicity to the other or photon splitting ) * maximum velocity ( e.g.  synchrotron peak from supernova remnants ) * dynamical effects of lv background fields ( e.g. gravitational coupling and additional wave modes )    the possibility of interesting constraints ( or observations ) of lv despite planck suppression arises in different ways for the different types of observations . in the laboratory experiments looking for sidereal variations ,",
    "the enormous number of atoms allow variations of a resonance frequency to be measured extremely accurately . in the case of dispersion or birefringence",
    ", the enormous propagation distances would allow a tiny effect to accumulate .",
    "in the new or shifted threshold case , the creation of a particle with mass @xmath1 would be strongly affected by a lv term when the momentum becomes large enough for this term to be comparable to the mass term in the dispersion relation . finally , an upper bound to electron group velocity , even if very near the speed of light , can severely limit the frequency of synchrotron radiation .",
    "we shall discuss examples of all these phenomena .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we aim to give an introductory overview of some of the important issues involved in the consideration of lorentz violation , including history , conceptual basis and problems , observable phenomena , and the current best constraints in certain sectors .",
    "second , we present a number of new results , including computations of rates of certain lv processes and the derivation of a new photon decay constraint .",
    "we also analyze the modifications of previous constraints that are required when the helicity dependence of the lv parameters is properly taken into account . in order to make the paper most useful as an introduction to lv we have placed much material , including most of the technical details of the new results , in appendices .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the next section gives a historical summary of lv research , while section [ parametrization ] introduces the framework for parameterizing lv , together with the conceptual issues this raises . in section [ sec : dim5 ] we focus on the phenomenology of dimension 5 lv in qed , and section [ constraints ] presents the current constraints on such lv .",
    "constraints on other sorts of lv are surveyed in section [ other ] , focusing on ultra - high energy cosmic rays , and we close in section  [ conclusions ] with a discussion of future prospects . appendix [ apsec : synch ] presents the analysis behind the lv synchrotron constraint , appendix [ apsec : threshconfig ] derives the lv threshold configuration results , and appendix [ apsec : rates ] includes the computation of rates and thresholds for some lv processes .",
    "we present at this point a brief historical overview of research related to lorentz violation , mentioning some influential work but without trying to be complete . for a more complete review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the idea of cosmological variation of coupling constants goes back at least to milne and dirac beginning in the 1930 s  @xcite , and continues to be of interest today .",
    "this would be associated with a form of lv since the spacelike surfaces on which the couplings are assumed constant would define a local preferred frame .",
    "it has recently been stimulated both by the string theoretic expectation that there are moduli fields , and by controversial observational evidence for variation of the fine structure constant @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "a set of related ideas goes under the generic name of `` varying speed of light cosmologies '' ( vsl ) , which includes numerous distinct formulations  @xcite .",
    "new models and observational constraints continue to be discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "suggestions of possible lv in particle physics go back at least to the 1960 s , when several authors wrote on that idea  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of lv in a metric theory of gravity was explored beginning at least as early as the 1970 s with work of nordtvedt and will  @xcite .",
    "such theoretical ideas were pursued in the 70 s and 80 s notably by nielsen and several other authors on the particle theory side  @xcite , and by gasperini  @xcite on the gravity side .",
    "a number of observational limits were obtained during this period  @xcite .    towards the end of the 80 s kostelecky and samuel  @xcite",
    "presented evidence for possible spontaneous lv in string theory , and motivated by this explored lv effects in gravitation .",
    "the role of lorentz invariance in the  trans  planckian puzzle \" of black hole redshifts and the hawking effect was emphasized in the early 90 s  @xcite .",
    "this led to study of the hawking effect for quantum fields with lv dispersion relations commenced by unruh  @xcite and followed up by others . early in the third millennium",
    "this line of research led to work on the related question of the possible imprint of trans ",
    "planckian frequencies on the primordial fluctuation spectrum  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the consequences of lv for particle physics were being explored using lv dispersion relations e.g. by gonzalez - mestres  @xcite .",
    "four developments in the late nineties seem to have stimulated a surge of interest in lv research .",
    "one was a systematic extension of the standard model of particle physics incorporating all possible lv in the renormalizable sector , developed by colladay and kosteleck  @xcite .",
    "that provided a framework for computing in effective field theory the observable consequences for many experiments and led to much experimental work setting limits on the lv parameters in the lagrangian  @xcite . on the observational side ,",
    "the agasa experiment reported ultra high energy ( uhe ) cosmic ray events beyond the gzk proton cutoff  @xcite .",
    "coleman and glashow then suggested the possibility that lv was the culprit in the possibly missing gzk cutoff  @xcite , and explored many other high energy consequences of renormalizable , isotropic lv leading to different limiting speeds for different particles  @xcite . in the fourth development , it was pointed out by amelino - camelia et al  @xcite that the sharp high energy signals of gamma ray bursts could reveal lv photon dispersion suppressed by one power of energy over the mass @xmath3 , tantalizingly close to the planck mass .",
    "together with the improvements in observational reach mentioned earlier , these developments attracted the attention of a large number of researchers to the subject . shortly after ref .",
    "@xcite appeared , gambini and pullin  @xcite argued that semiclassical loop quantum gravity suggests just such lv . following this work , a very strong constraint on photon birefringence was obtained by gleiser and kozameh  @xcite using uv light from distant galaxies .",
    "further stimulus came from the suggestion  @xcite that an lv threshold shift might explain the apparent under - absorption on the cosmic ir background of tev gamma rays from the blazar mkn501 , however it is now believed by many that this anomaly goes away when a corrected ir background is used  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the effective field theory ( eft ) framework to incorporate lv dispersion relations suppressed by the ratio @xmath0 was performed by myers and pospelov  @xcite .",
    "this allowed @xmath0 lv to be explored in a systematic way .",
    "the use of eft also imposes certain relations between the lv parameters for different helicities , which strengthened some prior constraints while weakening others . using eft a very strong constraint  @xcite on the possibility of a maximum electron speed less than the speed of light",
    "was deduced from observations of synchrotron radiation from the crab nebula . however , as discussed here , this constraint is weakened due to the helicity and particle / anti - particle dependence of the lv parameters",
    "a simple approach to a phenomenological description of lv is via deformed dispersion relations .",
    "this approach was adopted in much work on the subject , and it seems to afford a relatively theory - independent framework in which to explore the unknown possibilities . on the other hand , not much can really be predicted with confidence just based on free particle dispersion relations , without the use of both conservation laws and interaction dynamics .",
    "hence one is led to adopt a more comprehensive lv model in order to deduce meaningful constraints . in this section",
    "we discuss these ideas in turn , ending with a focus on the use of effective field theory , which provides a well - motivated and unambiguous hypothesis that can be tested .",
    "if rotation invariance and analyticity around @xmath4 are assumed the dispersion relation for a given particle type can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy , @xmath7 is hereafter the magnitude of the three - momentum , and ( p)= _ 1 p^1 + _ 2 p^2 + _ 3 p^3 + _ 4 p^4 + [ disprel1 ] since this relation is not lorentz invariant , the frame in which it applies must be specified .",
    "generally this is taken to be the average cosmological rest frame , i.e. the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background .   and @xmath8 , instead of just the speed of light like in special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "these theories are generally called doubly ( or deformed ) special relativity ( dsr )  @xcite . ]",
    "let us introduce two mass scales , @xmath9 , the putative scale of quantum gravity , and @xmath10 , a particle physics mass scale . to keep mass dimensions explicit we factor out possibly appropriate powers of these scales , defining the dimensionful @xmath11 s in terms of corresponding dimensionless parameters .",
    "it might seem natural that the @xmath12 term with @xmath13 be suppressed by @xmath14 , and indeed this has been assumed in many works .",
    "but following this pattern one would expect the @xmath15 term to be unsuppressed and the @xmath16 term to be even more important . since any lv at low energies must be small",
    ", such a pattern is untenable .",
    "thus either there is a symmetry or some other mechanism protecting the lower dimension operators from large lv , or the suppression of the higher dimension operators is greater than @xmath14 .",
    "this is an important issue to which we return in section  [ naturalness ] .    for the moment we simply follow the observational lead and insert at least one inverse power of @xmath17 in each term , viz . _ 1=_1 , _ 2=_2 , _ 3=_3 , _",
    "[ disprel2 ] in characterizing the strength of a constraint we refer to the @xmath18 without the tilde , so we are comparing to what might be expected from planck - suppressed lv .",
    "we allow the lv parameters @xmath19 to depend on the particle type , and indeed it turns out that they _ must _ sometimes be different but related in certain ways for photon polarization states , and for particle and antiparticle states , if the framework of effective field theory is adopted . in an even more general setting , lehnert  @xcite studied theoretical constraints on this type of lv and deduced the necessity of some of these parameter relations .",
    "the deformed dispersion relations are introduced for individual particles only ; those for macroscopic objects are then inferred by addition .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 particles with momentum @xmath21 and mass @xmath1 are combined , the total energy , momentum and mass are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 . although the lorentz violating term can be large in some fixed units , its ratio with the mass and momentum squared terms in the dispersion relation is the same as for the individual particles .",
    "hence , there is no observational conflict with standard dispersion relations for macroscopic objects .",
    "this general framework allows for superluminal propagation , and spacelike 4-momentum relative to a fixed background metric .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that this leads to problems with causality and stability . in the setting of a lv theory with a single preferred frame ,",
    "however , we do not share this opinion .",
    "we can not see any room for such problems to arise , as long as in the preferred frame the physics is guaranteed to be causal and the states all have positive energy .",
    "various different theoretical approaches to lv have been taken .",
    "some researchers restrict attention to lv described in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) , while others allow for effects not describable in this way , such as those that might be due to stochastic fluctuations of a `` space - time foam '' .",
    "some restrict to rotationally invariant lv , while others consider also rotational symmetry breaking . both true lv as well as  deformed \" lorentz symmetry ( in the context of so - called  doubly special relativity\"@xcite ) have been pursued .",
    "another difference in approaches is whether or not different particle types are assumed to have the same lv parameters .",
    "the rest of this article will focus on just one of these approaches , namely lv describable by standard eft , assuming rotational invariance , and allowing distinct lv parameters for different particles .",
    "this choice derives from the attitude that , in exploring the possible phenomenology of new physics , it is useful to retain enough standard physics so that clear predictions can be made , and to keep the possibilities narrow enough to be meaningfully constrained .",
    "furthermore , of the lv phenomena mentioned in the introduction , only dispersion and birefringence are determined solely by the kinematic dispersion relations .",
    "analysis of threshold reactions obviously requires in addition an assumption of energy - momentum conservation , and to impose constraints the reaction rates must be known .",
    "this requires knowledge of matrix elements , and hence the dynamics comes into play .",
    "we therefore need a complete ( at least at low energy ) theory to properly derive constraints .",
    "only eft currently satisfies this requirement .",
    "this approach is not universally favored ( for an example of a different approach see  @xcite )",
    ". therefore we think it is important to spell out the motivation for the choices we have made .",
    "first , while of course it may be that eft is not adequate for describing the leading quantum gravity phenomenology effects , it has proven very effective and flexible in the past .",
    "it produces local energy and momentum conservation laws , and seems to require for its applicability just locality and local spacetime translation invariance above some length scale .",
    "it describes the standard model and general relativity ( which are presumably not fundamental theories ) , a myriad of condensed matter systems at appropriate length and energy scales , and even string theory ( as perhaps most impressively verified in the calculations of black hole entropy and hawking radiation rates ) .",
    "it is true that , e.g. , non - commutative geometry ( ncg ) can lead to eft with problematic ir / uv mixing , however this more likely indicates a physically unacceptable feature of such ncg rather than a physical limitation of eft .",
    "it is worth remarking that while we choose eft so as to work in a complete and well motivated framework , in fact many constraints are actually quite insensitive to the specific dynamics of the theory , other than that it obeys energy - momentum conservation . as an example , consider photon decay . in ordinary lorentz",
    "invariant physics , photon decay into an electron / positron pair is forbidden since two timelike four - momenta ( the outgoing pair ) can not add up to the null four momentum of the photon .",
    "with lv the photon four momentum can be timelike and therefore photons above a certain energy can be unstable . once the reaction is kinematically allowed , the photon lifetime is extremely short ( @xmath26 sec ) when calculated with standard qed plus modified dispersion , much shorter for example than the required lifetime of @xmath27 seconds for high energy photons that reach us from the crab nebula .",
    "thus we could tolerate huge modifications to the matrix element ( the dynamics ) and still have a photon decay rate incompatible with observation .",
    "hence , often the dynamics is nt particularly important when deriving constraints .",
    "the assumption of rotational invariance is motivated by the idea that lv may arise in qg from the presence of a short distance cutoff .",
    "this suggests a breaking of boost invariance , with a preferred rest frame but not necessarily an observable breaking of rotational invariance .",
    "note also that it is very difficult to construct a theory that breaks rotation invariance while preserving boost invariance .",
    "( for example , if a spacelike four - vector is introduced to break rotation invariance , the four - vector also breaks boost invariance . ) since a constraint on pure boost violation is , barring a conspiracy , also a constraint on boost plus rotation violation , it is sensible to simplify with the assumption of rotation invariance at this stage .",
    "the preferred frame is assumed to coincide with the rest frame of the cmb since the universe provides this and no other candidate for a cosmic preferred frame .",
    "finally why do we choose to complicate matters by allowing for different lv parameters for different particles ?",
    "first , eft for first order planck suppressed lv ( see section  [ subsec : eftlv ] ) requires this for different polarizations or spin states , so it is unavoidable in that sense .",
    "second , we see no reason _ a priori _ to expect these parameters to coincide .",
    "the term `` equivalence principle '' has been used to motivate the equality of the parameters . however , in the presence of lv dispersion relations , free particles with different masses travel on different trajectories even if they have the same lv parameters  @xcite . moreover",
    ", different particles would presumably interact differently with the spacetime microstructure since they interact differently with themselves and with each other . for an explicit example",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "another example of this occurs in the braneworld model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an extreme version occurs in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite in which only certain particles feel the spacetime foam effects .",
    "( note however that in this proposal the lv parameters fluctuate even for a given kind of particle , so eft would not be a valid description . )      in this subsection we briefly discuss some explicit formulations of lveft . first , the ( minimal ) standard model extension ( sme ) of colladay and kosteleck  @xcite consists of the standard model of particle physics plus all lorentz violating renormalizable operators ( i.e. of mass dimension @xmath28 ) that can be written without changing the field content or violating the gauge symmetry . for illustration ,",
    "the leading order terms in the qed sector are the dimension three terms -b_a|_5 ^a -h_ab|^aband the dimension four terms -k^abcdf_abf_cd + |(c_ab+ d_ab_5)^a ^b , where the dimension one coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 and dimensionless @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are constant tensors characterizing the lv .",
    "if we assume rotational invariance then these must all be constructed from a given unit timelike vector @xmath34 and the minkowski metric @xmath35 , hence @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38[c } u^{d]}$ ] , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "such lv is thus characterized by just four numbers .",
    "the study of lorentz violating eft in the higher mass dimension sector was initiated by myers and pospelov  @xcite .",
    "they classified all lv dimension five operators that can be added to the qed lagrangian and are quadratic in the same fields , rotation invariant , gauge invariant , not reducible to a combination of lower and/or higher dimension operators using the field equations , and contribute @xmath41 terms to the dispersion relation .",
    "just three operators arise : -u^mf_ma(u)(u_n^na)+ u^m|_m(_1+_2_5)(u)^2[dim5 ] where @xmath42 denotes the dual of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "the sign of the @xmath45 term in ( [ dim5 ] ) is opposite to that in  @xcite , and is chosen so that positive helicity photons have @xmath46 for a dispersion coefficient ( see below )",
    ". also the factor 2 in the denominator is introduced to avoid a factor of 2 in the dispersion relation for photons .",
    "all of the terms ( [ dim5 ] ) violate cpt symmetry as well as lorentz invariance .",
    "thus if cpt were preserved , these lv operators would be forbidden .",
    "as discussed above in subsection [ subsec : disp ] , if lv operators of dimension @xmath47 are suppressed as we have imagined by @xmath14 , lv would feed down to the lower dimension operators and be strong at low energies  @xcite , unless there is a symmetry or some other mechanism that protects the lower dimension operators from strong lv .",
    "what symmetry ( other than lorentz invariance , of course ! ) could that possibly be ?    in the euclidean context , a discrete subgroup of the euclidean rotation group suffices to protect the operators of dimension four and less from violation of rotation symmetry .",
    "for example  @xcite , consider the `` kinetic '' term in the eft for a scalar field with hypercubic symmetry , @xmath48 .",
    "the only tensor @xmath49 with hypercubic symmetry is proportional to the kronecker delta @xmath50 , so full rotational invariance is an `` accidental '' symmetry of the kinetic operator .",
    "if one tries to mimic this construction on a minkowski lattice admitting a discrete subgroup of the lorentz group , one faces the problem that each point has an infinite number of neighbors related by the lorentz boosts . for the action to share the discrete symmetry each point would have to appear in infinitely many terms of the discrete action , presumably rendering the equations of motion meaningless .",
    "another symmetry that could do the trick is three dimensional rotational symmetry together with a symmetry between different particle types . for example",
    ", rotational symmetry would imply that the kinetic term for a scalar field takes the form @xmath51 , for some constant @xmath52 .",
    "then , for multiple scalar fields , a symmetry relating the fields would imply that the constant @xmath52 is the same for all , hence the kinetic term would be lorentz invariant with @xmath52 playing the role of the speed of light .",
    "unfortunately this mechanism does not work in nature , since there is no symmetry relating all the physical fields .",
    "perhaps under some conditions a partial symmetry could be adequate , e.g. grand unified gauge and/or super symmetry .",
    "in fact , some recent work  @xcite presents evidence that supersymmetry can indeed play this role .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) here refers to the symmetry algebra that is a ` square root ' of the spacetime translation group .",
    "the nature of this square root depends upon the minkowski metric , so is tied to the lorentz group , but it does not require lorentz symmetry .",
    "nibbelink and pospelov showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the superfield formalism , that the susy and gauge symmetry preserving lv operators that can be added to the susy standard model first appear at dimension five .",
    "this solves the naturalness problem in the sense of having planck - suppressed dimension five operators without accompanying huge lower dimension lv operators .",
    "however , it should be noted that in this scenario the @xmath53 terms in the particle dispersion relations are suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath54 compared to ( [ disprel1],[disprel2 ] ) .    in a different analysis , jain and ralston",
    "@xcite showed that if the wess - zumino model is cut off at the energy scale @xmath55 in a lv manner that preserves susy , then lv radiative corrections to the scalar particle self - energy are suppressed by the ratio @xmath56 , unlike in the non - susy case  @xcite where they diverge logarithmically with @xmath55 .",
    "this is another example of susy making approximate low energy lorentz symmetry natural in the presence of large high energy lv .",
    "of course susy is broken in the real world .",
    "lv susy qed with softly broken susy was recently studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was found there that , upon susy breaking , the dimension five susy operators generate dimension three operators large enough that the dimension five operators must be suppressed by a mass scale much greater than @xmath57 . in this sense ,",
    "the naturalness problem is _ not _ solved in this setting ( although it is not as severe as with no susy ) .",
    "if cpt symmetry is imposed however , then all the dimension five operators are excluded .",
    "after soft susy breaking , the dimension six lv operators generate dimension four lv operators that are currently not experimentally excluded .",
    "hence perhaps this latter scenario can solve the naturalness problem .",
    "but again , the susy lv operators considered in  @xcite do not give rise to the type of dispersion corrections we consider , hence the astrophysical bounds discussed here are not relevant to that susy model .    at this stage",
    "we assume the existence of some realization of the lorentz symmetry breaking scheme upon which constraints are being imposed .",
    "if none exists , then our parametrization ( [ disprel2 ] ) is misleading , since there should be more powers of @xmath58 suppressing the higher dimension terms . in that case ,",
    "current observational limits on those terms do not significantly constrain the fundamental theory .",
    "we now discuss in general terms the new phenomena arising when the extra dimension five operators in ( [ dim5 ] ) are added to the qed lagrangian .",
    "this lays the groundwork for the specific constraints discussed in the next section .",
    "free particles and tree level interactions can be analyzed without specifying the underlying mechanism that ( we assume ) protects approximate low energy lorentz symmetry , hence we restrict attention to these . in principle",
    "radiative loop corrections can not be avoided , but their treatment requires some commitment as to the specific mechanism .",
    "the appearance of higher time derivatives in the lagrangian brings with it , if treated exactly , an increase in the number of degrees of freedom . in the eft framework",
    "however it is natural to truncate the theory via perturbative reduction to the degrees of freedom that exist without the higher derivative terms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . although not discussed explicitly , it is this truncation we have in mind in what follows .        in lorentz gauge , @xmath59 ,",
    "the free field equation of motion for @xmath60 in the preferred frame from ( [ dim5 ] ) is @xmath61 for a particle travelling in the @xmath62-direction , the @xmath63 equations are the usual @xmath64 and hence the residual gauge freedom can still be applied to set @xmath65 , leaving two transverse polarizations with dispersion  @xcite @xmath66 the photon subscripts @xmath67 denote right and left polarization , @xmath68 , which have opposite dispersion corrections as a result of the cpt violation in the lagrangian .",
    "we now solve the modified free field dirac equation for the electron and positron eigenspinors and find the corresponding dispersion relations .",
    "we shall see that there exists a basis of energy eigenstates that also have definite helicity @xmath69 , hence helicity remains a good quantum number in the presence of the lv dimension five operators .",
    "beginning with the electron , we assume the eigenspinor has the form @xmath70 where @xmath7 is the 4-momentum vector , assumed to have positive energy , and @xmath71 denotes positive and negative helicity .",
    "the field equation from ( [ dim5 ] ) in the chiral basis implies @xmath72 where @xmath73 with @xmath74 ( the upper signs refer to @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 are the usual pauli spin matrices . if the spinors are helicity eigenspinors we can replace @xmath77 with simply @xmath78 .",
    "the dispersion relation is then @xmath79 , or [ eq : fermiondisp ] e^2=m^2+p^2 + e^2(e+sp ) + e^2(e - sp ) - e^4 moreover , the spinors @xmath80 and @xmath81 are proportional to each other , with ratio @xmath82 .",
    "the eigenspinors for the electron can thus be taken as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the two - component eigenspinor of @xmath85 .",
    "with eigenvalue @xmath86 .",
    "note that the dispersion relation @xmath79 implies that either @xmath75 and @xmath87 are both positive , or they are both negative .",
    "the definition ( [ arl ] ) shows that when the energy @xmath6 is positive and much smaller than @xmath17 , at least one of the two is always positive , hence they are both positive",
    ". then from ( [ eq : diraceqn ] ) we see that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are related by a positive real multiple , implying that the square roots in ( [ spinors ] ) have a common sign .",
    "the normalization of this spinor is @xmath88 . if the usual factor @xmath89 is included in the momentum integral in the field operator , the spinors should be normalized to @xmath90 to ensure the canonical commutation relations hold with the standard annihilation and creation operators assumed .",
    "since we work only at energies @xmath91 , the correction is small and may be neglected .",
    "the constraints we shall discuss arise from processes in which the energy satisfies @xmath92 . then to lowest order in @xmath1 and @xmath93 the dispersion relation ( [ eq : fermiondisp ] ) for positive and negative helicity electrons takes the form  @xcite @xmath94 where we have replaced @xmath6 by @xmath7 in the last term , which is valid to lowest order . at @xmath95",
    "the helicity states take the approximate form @xmath96 these are almost chiral , with mixing still controlled by the mass as in the usual lorentz invariant case .    to find the dispersion relation and spinor wavefunctions for positrons we can use the hole interpretation .",

    "the electron or positron dispersion relations ( [ eq : dispfermionhighe ] ) imply that if the @xmath108-parameter is negative for a given helicity , that helicity has a maximum propagation speed which is strictly less than the low frequency speed of light .",
    "this lv phenomenon would limit the frequency of synchrotron radiation produced by that helicity .",
    "this is not strictly a free particle effect since it involves acceleration in an external field and radiation , but the essential lv feature is the limiting speed . in the appendix section [ apsec : synch ]",
    "we review the eft analysis of this phenomenon .",

    "all but photon splitting have nonvanishing tree level amplitudes , hence can be considered without getting involved in the question of the uv completion of the theory .",
    "once loop amplitudes are considered , the uv completion becomes important , and as discussed in section [ naturalness ] can produce large effects at low energy unless there is fine tuning or a symmetry protection mechanism .",
    "the threshold effects can occur at energies many orders of magnitude below the planck scale . to see why , note that thresholds are determined by particle masses , hence if the @xmath114 term in eqs .",
    "( [ photondisp ] ) or ( [ eq : dispfermionhighe ] ) is comparable to the electron mass term , @xmath115 , one can expect a significant threshold shift .",
    "for lv coefficients of order one this occurs at the momentum @xmath116 which gives a rough idea of the energies one needs to reach in order to put constraints of order one on the lorentz violations considered here .     to use the anomalous decay processes for constraining",
    "lv one needs to know the threshold energy ( if any ) and how the rate depends on the incoming particle energy and the lv parameters .",
    "the details of computing these thresholds and rates are relegated to the appendix sections [ apsec : threshconfig ] and [ apsec : rates ] .",
    "here we just cite the main results .",
    "a photon with energy above a certain threshold can decay to an electron and a positron , @xmath117 .",
    "the threshold and rate for this process generally depend on all three lv parameters @xmath45 and @xmath118 .",
    "earlier use of the photon decay constraint with the dispersion relation ( [ photondisp ] ) did not allow for helicity and particle / anti - particle dependence of the lv parameters . to obtain constraints on just two parameters , but consistent with eft , we can focus on processes in which only either @xmath119 or @xmath120 is involved , namely reactions in which the positron has opposite helicity to the electron .",
    "for example , if the electron has positive helicity then its lv parameter is @xmath119 , and according to ( [ eq : ep ] ) the lv parameter for the negative helicity positron is @xmath121 .    at threshold ,",
    "the final particle momenta are all aligned ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ apsec : threshconfig ] ) .",
    "since the incoming photon has nonzero spin , angular momentum can not be conserved if the electron and positron have opposite helicities .",
    "however , the momenta _ above _ threshold need not be aligned , so that angular momentum can be conserved with opposite helicities at any energy above threshold . in this case",
    ", the rate vanishes at threshold and is suppressed very close to the threshold , but above the threshold the rate quickly begins to scale as @xmath93 , where @xmath6 is the photon energy .. ] for a 10 tev photon , this corresponds to a decay time of order @xmath122 seconds ( where we have taken into account the extra suppression coming from overall numerical factors , see section  [ subsubsec : photondecayrate ] in the appendix ) .",
    "the rapidity of the reaction ( in comparison to the required lifetime of @xmath27 seconds for an observed crab photon ) implies that a threshold constraint , i.e. a bound on lv coefficients such that the reaction does not happen at all , will be extremely close to the constraint derived by requiring the lifetime to be longer than the observed travel time .      the process @xmath123 can either preserve or flip the helicity of the electron . if the electron helicity is unchanged we call it vacuum erenkov radiation , while if the helicity changes we call it helicity decay .",
    "vacuum erenkov radiation occurs only above a certain energy threshold , and above that energy the rate of energy loss scales as @xmath124 , which implies that a 10 tev electron would emit a significant fraction of its energy in @xmath125 seconds . above the threshold energy ,",
    "constraints derived simply from threshold analysis alone are again reliable .",
    "in contrast , if the positive and negative helicity lv parameters for electrons are unequal , say @xmath126 , then decay from negative to positive helicity can happen at any energy , i.e. there is no threshold .",
    "of the two helicity electrons can be connected by a null vector for any energy .",
    "therefore there is always a way to conserve energy - momentum with photon emission ( the photon four - vector is almost null even with lv ) .",
    "] however it can be shown ( see appendix [ subsec : heldec ] ) that assuming generic order unity values of the lv parameters , the rate is extremely small until the energy is comparable to the threshold for erenkov radiation . above this energy ,",
    "the rate is @xmath127 independent of the lv parameters , which ( taking into account all the numerical factors ) implies that a 10 tev electron would flip helicity in about @xmath125 seconds .",
    "thus , above this  effective threshold \" , constraints on helicity decay derived from the value of the effective threshold alone are reliable .",
    "the process @xmath128 is similar to vacuum erenkov radiation or helicity decay , with the final photon replaced by an electron - positron pair .",
    "this reaction has been studied previously in the context of the sme  @xcite .",
    "various combinations of helicities for the different fermions can be considered individually . if we choose the particularly simple case ( and the only one we shall consider here ) where all electrons have the same helicity and the positron has the opposite helicity , then according to eq .",
    "[ eq : ep ] the threshold energy will depend on only one lv parameter . in appendix [ app : pairemission ] we derive the threshold for this reaction , finding that it is a factor @xmath129 times higher than that for soft vacuum erenkov radiation .",

    "the photon splitting processes @xmath130 and @xmath131 , etc .",

    "these processes are generally allowed when @xmath132 .",
    "however , the effectiveness of this reaction in providing constraints depends heavily on the decay rate .",
    "aspects of vacuum photon splitting have been examined in  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the rate , independent of the particular form of the lorentz violating theory and neglecting the polarization dependence of the photon dispersion relation , was given in ref .",

    "it was implicitly assumed in this argument that no large dimensionless ratios occur in the rate .",
    "however , a recent paper  @xcite shows that such a large ratio can indeed occur .",
    "@xcite analyzes the case where there is no lorentz violation in the electron - positron sector .",
    "then the ( lorentz - invariant ) one - loop euler - heisenberg lagrangian characterizes the photon interaction , even in the  rest frame \" of the incoming photon . using this interaction it",
    "is argued that the lifetime is much shorter , by a factor @xmath136 , than the lower bound mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath137 in the rate is compatible with the analysis of  @xcite since there only the _ minimum _ number of factors of @xmath137 was determined .",
    "however , the possibile appearance of a large dimensionless factor like @xmath138 in the rate was overlooked in  @xcite .    using 50 tev photons from the crab nebula , about @xmath139 seconds away , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite would have implied that the constraint on @xmath45 can be no stronger than @xmath140 , and even this is not competitive with the other constraints . however , for a 50 tev photon the extra factor in the lifetime from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is of order @xmath141 , which would produce a bound @xmath142 .",
    "note however that this analysis so far neglects the helicity dependence of the photon dispersion , and assumes no lorentz violation in the electron - positron sector .",
    "a process related to photon decay is photon absorption , @xmath143 . unlike photon decay ,",
    "this is allowed in lorentz invariant qed .",
    "if one of the photons has energy @xmath144 , the threshold for the reaction occurs in a head - on collision with the second photon having the momentum ( equivalently energy ) @xmath145 . for @xmath146 tev ( which is relevant for the observational constraints )",
    "the soft photon threshold @xmath144 is approximately 25 mev , corresponding to a wavelength of 50 microns .    in the presence of lorentz",
    "violating dispersion relations the threshold for this process is in general altered , and the process can even be forbidden . moreover , as noticed by kluniak  @xcite , in some cases there is an upper threshold beyond which the process does not occur .",
    "the lower and upper thresholds for photon annihilation as a function of the two parameters @xmath45 and @xmath108 , were obtained in  @xcite , before the helicity dependence required by eft was appreciated . as the soft photon energy is low enough that its lv can be ignored , this corresponds to the case where electrons and positrons have the same lv terms .",
    "the analysis is rather complicated . in particular",
    "it is necessary to sort out whether the thresholds are lower or upper ones , and whether they occur with the same or different pair momenta .",
    "the photon absorption constraint , neglecting helicity dependent effects , came from the fact that lv can shift the standard qed threshold for annihilation of multi ",
    "tev @xmath147-rays from nearby blazars , such as mkn 501 , with the ambient infrared extragalactic photons  @xcite .",
    "lv depresses the rate of absorption of one photon helicity , and increases it for the other .",
    "although the polarization of the @xmath147-rays is not measured , the possibility that one of the polarizations is essentially unabsorbed appears to be ruled out by the observations which show the predicted attenuation  @xcite . the threshold analysis has not been redone to allow for the helicity and particle / anti - particle dependence of @xmath108 .",
    "the motivation for doing so is not great since the constraint would at best not be competitive with other constraints , and the power of the constraint is limited by our ignorance of the source spectrum of emitted gamma rays .",
    "in this section we discuss the current observational constraints on the lv parameters @xmath45 and @xmath118 in the myers - pospelov extension of qed , focusing on those coming from high energy processes .",

    "the currently most useful constraints are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the allowed parameter space corresponds to the dark region of the figure .",
    "these constraints strongly bound lorentz violation at order @xmath114 in qed , assuming the framework of effective field theory holds .",
    "while the natural magnitude of the photon and electron coefficients @xmath148 would be of order unity if there is one power of suppression by the inverse planck mass , the coefficients are now restricted to the region @xmath149 by birefringence and @xmath150 by photon decay .",
    "the narrower bell - shaped region bounded by the dashed lines is determined by the combination of synchrotron and erenkov constraints and applies only to one of the four pairs @xmath151 .",
    "equivalently , the union of this bell - shaped region with its reflection about the @xmath45 axis applies to one of the two pairs @xmath152 .",
    "we shall now briefly discuss how each constraint is obtained , leaving the details for the appendices .",
    "photon time of flight constraints  @xcite limit differences in the arrival time at earth for photons originating in a distant event  @xcite .",
    "time of flight can vary with energy since the lv term in the group velocity is @xmath153 .",
    "the arrival time difference for wave - vectors @xmath154 and @xmath155 is thus t=(k_2-k_1 ) d / m , [ timediff ] which is proportional to the energy difference and the distance travelled .",
    "constraints were obtained using the high energy radiation emitted by some gamma ray bursts ( grb ) and active galaxies of the blazars class .",
    "the strength of such constraints is typically @xmath156 or weaker  @xcite .",
    "a possible problem with the above bounds is that in an emission event it is not known if the photons of different energies are produced simultaneously . if different energies are emitted at different times that might mask a lv signal .",
    "one way around this is to look for correlations between time delay and redshift , which has been done for a set of grb s in  @xcite .",
    "since time of flight delay is a propagation effect that increases over time , a survey of grb s at different redshifts can separate this from intrinsic source effects .",
    "this enables constraints to be imposed ( or lv to be observed ) despite uncertainty regarding source effects .",
    "while bounds derived in this way are , at present , weaker than the bound presented here , they are also more robust",
    ". one might also think that the source uncertainties in grb s could be mitigated by looking at high energy narrow bursts , which by definition have nearly simultaneous emission .",
    "however , for high energy narrow bursts the number of photons per unit time can be very low , thereby limiting the shortest detectable time lag  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneity problem may also be avoided if one uses the eft dispersion relation ( [ photondisp ] ) for photons of the same energy .",
    "then one can consider the velocity difference of the two polarizations at a _ single _ energy  @xcite t=2||k / m .",
    "[ timediff2 ] in principle this leads to a constraint at least twice as large as the one arising from energy differences which is also independent of any intrinsic time lag between different energy photons .",
    "[ it is possible , of course , that there is an intrinsic helicity source effect , however this seems unlikely . ] in fig .  [ fig:1 ]",
    "we use the eft improvement of the constraint of biller et al .",
    "@xcite , obtained using the blazar markarian 421 , an object whose distance is reliably known , which yields @xmath157  @xcite .",
    "note however that this bound assumes that both polarizations are observed .",
    "if for some reason ( such as photon decay of one polarization ) only one polarization is observed , then the bound shown in is fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] weakened by a factor of two . in any case the time of flight constraint remains many orders of magnitude weaker than the birefringence constraint so is rather irrelevant from an eft perspective .",
    "the birefringence constraint arises from the fact that the lv parameters for left and right circular polarized photons are opposite ( [ photondisp ] ) .",
    "the phase velocity thus depends on both the wavevector and the helicity .",
    "linear polarization is therefore rotated through an energy dependent angle as a signal propagates , which depolarizes an initially linearly polarized signal comprised of a range of wavevectors .",
    "hence the observation of linearly polarized radiation coming from far away can constrain the magnitude of the lv parameter .    in more detail , with the dispersion relation ( [ photondisp ] )",
    "the direction of linear polarization is rotated through the angle ( t)=t/2=k^2 t/2 m [ rotation ] for a plane wave with wave - vector @xmath158 over a propagation time @xmath159 .",
    "the difference in rotation angles for wave - vectors @xmath154 and @xmath155 is thus = ( k_2 ^ 2-k_1 ^ 2 ) d/2 m , [ diffrotation ] where we have replaced the time @xmath159 by the distance @xmath160 from the source to the detector ( divided by the speed of light ) .",
    "note that the effect is _ quadratic _ in the photon energy , and proportional to the distance travelled .",
    "the constraint arises from the fact that once the angle of polarization rotation differs by more than @xmath161 over the range of energies in a signal , the net polarization is suppressed .",
    "this effect has been used to constrain lv in the dimension three ( chern - simons )  @xcite , four  @xcite and five terms .",
    "the strongest currently reliable constraint on the dimension five term was deduced by gleiser and kozameh  @xcite using uv light from distant galaxies , and is given by @xmath162 .",
    "the much stronger constraint @xmath163 was derived  @xcite from the report  @xcite of a high degree of polarization of mev photons from grb021206 .",
    "however , the data has been reanalyzed in two different studies and no statistically significant polarization was found  @xcite .",
    "apart from the two constraints just discussed , all the others reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] arise from observations of the crab nebula .",
    "this object is the remnant of a supernova that was observed in 1054 a.d . , and lies only about 1.9 kpc from earth .",
    "it is characterized by the most energetic qed processes observed ( e.g. it is the source of the highest energy gamma rays ) and is very well studied .",
    "in contrast to the distant sources desirable for constraints based on the cumulative effects of lorentz violation , the crab nebula is nearby . this proximity facilitates the detection of the low fluxes characteristic of the emission at the highest energies , which is particularly useful for the remaining constraints . before undertaking a discussion of the constraints",
    "we first summarize the nature of the crab emission .",
    "the crab nebula is a bright source of radio , optical , x - ray and gamma - ray emission .",
    "it exhibits a broad spectrum characterized by two marked humps .",
    "this spectrum is consistently explained by a combination of synchrotron emission by a high energy wind of electrons and positrons , and inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons ( plus perhaps 10% other ambient photons ) by the same charges  @xcite .",
    "no other model for the emission is under consideration , other than for producing some fraction of the highest energy photons .",
    "for the constraints discussed here we assume that this standard synchrotron / inverse compton model is correct .",
    "in contrast to our previous work , here we take fully into account the role of the positrons , as well as the helicity and particle / anti - particle dependence of the lv parameters .",
    "this complicates matters and changes the nature of the constraints , weakening some aspects and strengthening others .",
    "the inverse compton gamma ray spectrum of the crab extends up to energies of at least 50 tev .",
    "the synchrotron emission has been observed to extend at least up to energies of about 100 mev  @xcite , just before the inverse compton hump begins to contribute to the spectrum . in standard lorentz invariant qed",
    ", 100 mev synchrotron radiation in a magnetic field of 0.6 mg would be produced by electrons ( or positrons ) of energy 1500 tev .",
    "the magnetic field in the emission region has been estimated by several methods which agree on a value between 0.150.6 mg ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "two of these methods , radio synchrotron emission and equipartition of energy , are insensitive to planck suppressed lorentz violation , hence we are justified in adopting a value of this order for the purpose of constraining lorentz violation .",
    "we use the largest value 0.6 mg for @xmath164 , since it yields the weakest constraint for the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the observation of 50 tev gamma rays emitted from the crab nebula implies that the threshold for photon decay for at least one helicity must be above 50 tev . by considering decays",
    "in which the electron and positron have opposite helicity we can separately constrain both @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( cf .",
    "section  [ photondecay ] and appendix  [ apsec : rates ] ) .",
    "the allowed region is the union of those for which positive and negative helicity photons do not decay .",
    "this yields the constraint shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the complete form of the allowed region was determined numerically .",
    "however in the region @xmath167 defined by the birefringence constraint , @xmath45 can be neglected compared to @xmath118 , in which case the constraint takes the analytic form @xmath168 .",
    "with @xmath169 this evaluates to @xmath170 .",
    "the inverse compton ( ic ) erenkov constraint uses the electrons and positrons of energy up to 50 tev inferred via the observation of 50 tev gamma rays from the crab nebula which are explained by ic scattering . since the vacuum erenkov rate is orders of magnitude higher than the ic scattering rate , that process must not occur for these charges  @xcite for at least one of the four charge species ( plus or minus helicity electron or positron ) , and for either photon helicity .",
    "the excluded region in parameter space is thus symmetric about the @xmath108-axis , but applies only to one of the four parameters @xmath171 .",

    ", electron / positron stability would lead to the constraint @xmath182 .",
    "this is a factor of 16 higher than that from the soft erenkov threshold , and roughly the same as the photon decay constraint .",
    "however , at least without further detailed analysis of the crab spectrum , all we can say is that at least _ one _ of the fermion types is able to produce the 50 tev ic radiation . by itself",
    "this imposes no constraint at all , since for each helicity either the electron or the positron of the opposite helicity is stable to this particular pair emission process .",
    "an electron or positron with a negative value of @xmath108 has a maximal group velocity less than the low energy speed of light , hence there is a maximal synchrotron frequency @xmath183 ( [ eq : opeaklv2 ] ) that it can produce , regardless of its energy  @xcite ( for details see appendix  [ apsec : synch ] ) .",

    "this is always a hard photon threshold , since the soft photon threshold occurs when the electron group velocity reaches the low energy speed of light , whereas the velocity required to produce any finite synchrotron frequency is smaller than this .",

    "the reason is that otherwise the synchrotron charges would violate the erenkov constraint , hence their energy would necessarily be under 50 tev , which is thirty times lower than the lorentz invariant value of 1500 tev for the highest energy synchrotron charges . by itself",
    "this is not impossible since , as explained in appendix  [ apsec : synch ] , if @xmath108 is positive a charge with lower energy can produce high frequency synchrotron radiation .",

    "in fact , if one assumes the cosmic rays already observed near but below the gzk cutoff are hadrons , one obtains a strong bound  @xcite . depending on the species and helicity dependence of the lv coefficients , bounds of order @xmath250 or better can be placed on @xmath246 .",
    "the bounds claimed in  @xcite are actually two sided , and come about in a manner somewhat analogous to ( but more complicated than ) the photon decay constraint ( see section  [ photondecay ] ) .",
    "they are derived by using a parton model for particles where the lv coefficients apply to the constituent partons . by considering many different outgoing particle spectra from an incoming hadron in combination with the parton approach the authors of  @xcite are able to find sets of reactions that yield two sided bounds .",
    "hence , the parton approach is quite useful , as it dramatically increases the number of constraints that can be derived from a single incoming particle .",
    "one might think that impressive constraints can also be obtained from the absence of neutrino vacuum erenkov radiation : putting in 1 ev for the mass in ( [ eta4bound ] ) yields an order unity constraint from 100 tev neutrinos , but only if the erenkov _ rate _ is high enough .",
    "the rate will be low , since it proceeds only via the non - local charge structure of the neutrino .",

    "the specific value of the constraint would depend on the exact value of the rate , which has not yet been computed . for a _ gravitational _ erenkov reaction ,",
    "the rate ( which is lower but easier to compute than the electromagnetic rate ) would be high enough for a @xmath242 ev neutrino from a distant source to radiate provided @xmath251 .",
    "hence in this case one might obtain a constraint of order @xmath252 from gravitational erenkov .",
    "if erenkov constraints apply only when the observed uhe neutrino originates from a _ distant _ source , one would need to either identify an astrophysical object as the source or somehow otherwise rule out local generation of the neutrino .",

    "in the last decade or so the old dogma that all our observations are insensitive to planck scale effects has been shown to be quite wrong if lorentz symmetry is violated .",

    "experiments like glast ( gamma - ray large area space telescope )  @xcite may be helpful in improving bounds from time of flight ; they might lead to a better understanding of grb emissions and provide far better photon counts and time resolution ( less than @xmath258sec ) .",
    "these improvements might help overcome some of the problems involving grb time of flight measurements discussed in section  [ sec : tof ] .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for a detailed discussion of these issues .",
    "here we focused on lv in the dimension five , cpt violating sector of qed , characterized by the photon parameter @xmath180 bounded at @xmath259 and the electron parameters @xmath179 bounded collectively at @xmath260 , while at least one of them is bounded at @xmath261 . the most promising prospect for significant improvement in these bounds",
    "would be a closer study of the effect of this sort of lv on the complete electromagnetic spectrum of the crab nebula and or other plerions .",
    "we have been very conservative in imposing constraints , by allowing for the possibility that with lv the synchrotron radiation could be produced by much lower energy charges than required in the usual lorentz invariant case .",
    "we have also tolerated the possibility of four different populations of charges behaving differently ( two helicities for electrons and positrons ) . by modelling more completely the production of the electron - positron wind and electromagnetic spectrum in the presence of such lv it may be possible to infer that charges of energy 1500 tev are in fact required as in the lorentz invariant case . if so , the constraints on @xmath118 might be improved by a factor of order @xmath262 to @xmath263 , and that on @xmath180 by a factor of order @xmath264 to @xmath265 as well .",
    "this would seem to be rather definitive so is a useful goal . to achieve",
    "it would perhaps require not only better modelling of the lv effects but more precise observations of the crab nebula .",
    "in this regard we can look forward to the observations to be made with glast which should start its observations in 2007 .",
    "the birefringence bound , currently of order @xmath266 from uv polarization observations of a distant galaxy , might be improved in various ways . since the lv effect scales as the square of the energy , the most dramatic improvement would be if polarized gamma rays from a distant source could be observed , for example from a grb .",

    "this might be possible with rhessi or via the ibis camera of the integral satellite  @xcite , using the so - called compton mode that was used in the previous rhessi analyses .",
    "less dramatically , it might instead be possible to improve by an order of magnitude the constraint reported in  @xcite , obtained using uv light from the radio galaxy 3c 256 , via specifically targeted observations possibly using fors1  @xcite at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , and/or by observing more distant sources of polarized uv light .",

    "finally also very effective could be some proposed experiments like the underground salt based detector salsa ( salt - dome shower array )  @xcite .    in closing , we have been motivated by considerations of quantum gravity to look for evidence of , and bounds on , lorentz violation .",
    "these considerations include suggestions of lv from various viewpoints , as well as simple desperation for observational guidance .",
    "the constraints discussed here and elsewhere are mounting up to a significant limitation on the possibility of lv in quantum gravity , at least insofar as would appear in low energy effective field theory .",

    "all lorentz violating terms in the equation of motion are suppressed by the ratio @xmath268 . from this",

    "following our previous choice of eft we allow each particle to have an independent dispersion relation of the form ( [ gen - disprel ] ) with @xmath306 a monotonically increasing non - negative function of the magnitude @xmath7 of the 3-momentum @xmath307 . while the assumption of monotonicity could perhaps be violated at the planck scale , it is satisfied for any reasonable low energy expansion of a lv dispersion relation .",
    "eft further implies that energy and momentum are additive for multiple particles , and conserved .",
    "consider a four - particle interaction where a target particle of 3-momentum @xmath308 is hit by a particle of 3-momentum @xmath309 , with an angle @xmath2 between the two momenta , producing two particles of momenta @xmath310 and @xmath311 .",
    "we call @xmath312 the angle between @xmath310 and the total incoming 3-momentum @xmath313 .",
    "we define the notion of a threshold relative to a fixed value of the magnitude of the target momentum @xmath314 . a lower or upper threshold corresponds to a value of @xmath315 ( or equivalently the energy @xmath316 )",
    "above which the reaction starts or stops being allowed by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "we now introduce a graphical interpretation of the energy - momentum conservation equation that allows the properties of thresholds to be easily understood . for given values of @xmath317 ,",
    "momentum conservation determines @xmath318 .",
    "since @xmath319 and @xmath318 determine the final energies @xmath320 and @xmath321 , we can thus define the final energy function @xmath322 .",
    "( since @xmath314 is fixed we drop it from the labelling . )",
    "energy conservation requires that @xmath323 be equal to @xmath324 , the initial energy ( again , we do not indicate the dependence on the fixed momentum @xmath314 ) .",
    "now consider the region @xmath325 in the @xmath326 plane covered by plotting @xmath322 for all possible configurations @xmath327 .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : r ] .",
    "the region @xmath325 is bounded below by @xmath328 since the particle energies are assumed non - negative , hence it has some bounding curve @xmath329 .",
    "similarly one can plot @xmath324 .",
    "the reaction threshold occurs when @xmath324 enters or leaves @xmath325 , since it is precisely in @xmath325 that there is a solution to the energy and momentum conservation equations .",
    "this graphical representation demonstrates that in any threshold configuration ( lower or upper ) occurring at some @xmath315 , the parameters @xmath327 are such that the final energy function @xmath322 is minimized .",
    "that is , the configuration always yields the minimum final particle energy configuration conserving momentum at fixed @xmath315 and @xmath314 .",
    "from this fact , it is easy to deduce two general properties of these configurations :    1 .",
    "all thresholds for processes with two outgoing particles occur at parallel final momenta ( @xmath330 ) .",
    "2 .   for a two particle initial state",
    "the momenta are antiparallel at threshold ( @xmath331 ) .",
    "these properties are in agreement with the well known case of lorentz invariant kinematics .",
    "nevertheless , lv thresholds can exhibit new features not present in the lorentz invariant theory , in particular upper thresholds , and asymmetric pair creation .",
    "figure  [ fig : r ] clearly shows that lv allows for a reaction to not only to start at some lower threshold but also to end at some upper threshold where the curve @xmath332 exits the region @xmath325 .",
    "it can even happen that @xmath332 enters and exits @xmath325 more than once , in which case there are what one might call  local \" lower and upper thresholds .",
    "another interesting novelty is the possibility to have a ( lower or upper ) threshold for pair creation with an unequal partition of the initial momentum @xmath333 into the two outgoing particles ( i.e. @xmath334 ) .",
    "equal partition of momentum is a familiar result of lorentz invariant physics , which follows from the fact that the final particles are all at rest in the zero - momentum frame at threshold .",
    "this has often been ( erroneously ) presumed to hold as well in the presence of lv dispersion relations .",
    "a reason for the occurrence of asymmetric lv thresholds can be seen graphically , as shown in figure  [ fig : asymm ] .",
    "suppose the dispersion relation for a massive outgoing particle @xmath335 has negative curvature at @xmath336 , as might be the case for negative lv coefficients .",
    "then a small momentum - conserving displacement from a symmetric configuration can lead to a net decrease in the final state energy . according to the result established above",
    ", the symmetric configuration can not be the threshold one in such a case .",
    "a lower @xmath315 could satisfy both energy and momentum conservation with an asymmetric final configuration .",
    "a _ sufficient _ condition for the pair - creation threshold configuration to be asymmetric is that the final particle dispersion relation has negative curvature at @xmath336 .",
    "this condition is not necessary however , since it could happen that the energy is locally but not globally minimized by the symmetric configuration .",
    "in this appendix we first derive a general expression for reaction rates .",
    "we then discuss the rates and thresholds for three reactions of interest : photon decay , vacuum erenkov , and helicity decay .",
    "the first step in deriving constraints from particle interactions is to derive the rate @xmath337 for various processes .",
    "as it turns out , the most useful constraints are derived from reactions where a single particle decays into two particles .",
    "if we label the incoming particle momentum and helicity / polarization by @xmath338 and the final particles by @xmath339 then the rate for fixed helicities is given by  @xcite @xmath340 where @xmath341 is the matrix element .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsubsec : fermions ] our fermion spinors are not quite normalized to @xmath90 . as a result ( [ eq : peskinrate ] )",
    "is not quite correct .",
    "however , as long as we work in the preferred frame , this correction is small and can be neglected since it is only a factor in overall normalization .",
    "if we choose the initial particle to be travelling in the @xmath62-direction , then we can integrate over @xmath342 and apply the axial symmetry to get @xmath343 integrating over @xmath344 then yields @xmath345 this expression and those that follow are evaluated at the solution of the energy conservation equation , @xmath346 .",
    "the limits of integration @xmath347 are the bounds between which such a solution exists .",
    "we are mostly interested in cases where there is no solution unless @xmath7 is greater than some threshold momentum @xmath348 . for reactions that do not occur in the lorentz - invariant limit ,",
    "the phase space must close up as we approach lorentz invariance , i.e.the magnitude of @xmath344 vanishes as @xmath349 .",
    "hence @xmath344 must be small relative to @xmath350 and @xmath351 if @xmath352 . the exception to this is if either @xmath353 is near zero , i.e. when either @xmath354 or @xmath355 .",
    "this region is , however , a negligible amount of phase space and so we ignore it . thus @xmath344 can be treated as an expansion parameter .",
    "expanding the derivative of @xmath356 with respect to @xmath344 gives @xmath357 and substituting into ( [ eq : gendedt1 ] ) gives @xmath358 to compute an energy loss rate for the erenkov effect a @xmath350 must be inserted in the integrand to reflect the energy carried off by the emitted photon .",
    "we now show that , if the incoming momentum @xmath7 is above the threshold @xmath348 , then the rate for photon decay is very high .",
    "the qed matrix element for photon decay is @xmath359 where @xmath360 is the outgoing electron spinor and @xmath361 is the outgoing positron spinor .",
    "we consider the case where the electron and positron have positive and negative helicity respectively , so only the coefficient @xmath119 is involved .",
    "the lv term in the electron dispersion is @xmath362 ( with @xmath363 wavefunction ( [ spinors ] ) ) while that in the positron dispersion is @xmath364 ( with @xmath365 wavefunction ( [ pspinors ] ) ) .",
    "the result is directly transferable to the @xmath120 case .",
    "we will also relabel @xmath306 as @xmath366 since the incoming particle is a photon .    with these choices the dominant contribution to the matrix element at high energy",
    "is straightforwardly evaluated as @xmath367\\ ] ] which is equal to @xmath368\\ ] ] where @xmath369 are the opening angles of the electron and positron and the @xmath67 reflects the initial photon polarization .",
    "( the overall phase depends on the phase convention for the spinors and does not affect the result . )",
    "note that the matrix element vanishes in the threshold configuration when the momenta are all parallel .",
    "this is because we chose the electron and positron helicities to be opposite .",
    "nevertheless , above threshold the rate is high enough to obtain a useful constraint , as we now argue .",
    "the opening angles are small , since the perpendicular momenta are planck suppressed . therefore we can expand ( [ eq : mphotdecaytheta ] ) to first order in @xmath369 , yielding [ eq : phot - dec - m ] im = ie , where @xmath344 is the magnitude of the perpendicular momentum ( which is the same for the electron and positron ) . recall that @xmath344 is determined from the energy conservation equation ( where @xmath158 is the initial photon momentum ) , @xmath370 in ( [ eq : cons ] ) we have already cancelled the 0th order terms using momentum conservation , and we have neglected higher order terms in @xmath371 .",
    "we have also assumed that the @xmath62-components of the electron and positron momenta are both positive .",

    "well above threshold the mass term becomes negligible , and the longitudinal phase space is determined by those @xmath62 values for which @xmath376 is positive in the interval @xmath377 $ ] .    using these results in the expression ( [ eq : gendedt ] ) for the decay rate",
    "we find that , well above threshold , the rate for decay of a positive helicity photon to a positive helicity electron and negative helicity positron is given by .",
    "where @xmath378 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this agrees up to a numerical factor with the estimate in  @xcite in the case where @xmath379 .    for the purposes of imposing constraints , it is important to know how rapidly the decay rate becomes large above threshold .",
    "we will return to this question in section  [ subsec : phot - dec - ratenear ] , after we derive the photon decay threshold .",
    "the photon decay threshold is found by setting @xmath380 and solving for the minimum value of @xmath158 for which there is a solution for some @xmath62 . from the threshold analysis",
    "described in section  [ apsec : threshconfig ] we know that the outgoing momenta are parallel , hence @xmath381 at threshold , so the minimum must have @xmath62 within this range .",
    "let us specialize to the case of a positive helicity photon ( the negative helicity case works similarly ) . in terms of the variable @xmath382 ,",
    "the condition that ( [ eq : pbot ] ) vanish then becomes [ eq : pbot3 ] ( 1-x^2)(+ _ + x ) = .",
    "the range of @xmath383 is @xmath384 , so we see that if @xmath385 is sufficiently large for a given @xmath45 the conservation equation has a solution .",
    "hence the threshold depends on @xmath119 only through its absolute value ( the equation is invariant under @xmath386 ) .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that since the positron and electron have opposite dispersion , one is always subluminal . by depositing most of the outgoing momentum in the subluminal particle",
    "we can magnify its lv while minimizing the lv of the superluminal partner .",
    "hence for either sign of @xmath119 we can find a solution .",
    "since the rhs of ( [ eq : pbot3 ] ) decreases as @xmath158 increases , the threshold will occur when the lhs is at its maximum in @xmath383 .",
    "let us consider a few special cases .",
    "first , if if @xmath379 , then the lhs has a positive maximum only if @xmath132 .",
    "this occurs at @xmath387 ( equal electron and positron momenta ) and is equal to @xmath45 . in this case",

    "the threshold @xmath388 satisfies @xmath393 .",
    "if @xmath394 , the lhs is never positive in the range @xmath384 , so photon decay does not occur for such parameters . more generally , the maximum of the lhs occurs at [ eq : x ] x_max= . substituting @xmath395 into ( [ eq : pbot3 ] ) allows us to find the maximum of the lhs , but the expression is a bit complicated so we do nt bother to display it here .",
    "one can use it to solve for @xmath45 as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath388 and thus derive a constraint .",
    "we now return to the question of reaction rate above threshold .",
    "if particle lifetimes are short slightly above threshold , then we are justified in using the absence of a threshold to establish constraints on the parameters . as a simple example of the rapidity with which reaction rates increase above threshold ,",
    "let us analyze photon decay with @xmath390 , a positive helicity incoming photon , and @xmath396 ( other parameter choices and the cerenkov effect work similarly ) .",
    "we expand the initial photon momentum as @xmath397 , where @xmath398 and @xmath399 . at threshold the entire phase space",

    "[ eq : gendedt ] and  [ eq : phot - dec - m ] we need to know the range in @xmath383 slightly above threshold and the value of @xmath344 in this range to first order in @xmath2 .",

    "the lifetime of the photon is equal to @xmath414tev seconds , short enough that on any relevant astrophysical timescale a population of photons of multi - tev energies will almost completely decay .",
    "as this example demonstrates , since the lifetime is extremely short only slightly above threshold , we are justified in using threshold values to derive constraints .",
    "the vacuum erenkov process @xmath415 is forbidden by angular momentum conservation in the threshold configuration . however , as with photon decay to opposite helicities , the rate becomes large above threshold .",
    "in fact the rate calculation is very close to that for photon decay .",

    "[ pcerenkov ] this turns out to be the threshold energy for the vacuum erenkov process with emission of a zero energy photon , which we call the soft erenkov threshold .",

    "this hard erenkov threshold occurs at @xmath418 , and the emitted photon carries away half the incoming electron momentum .",
    "it turns out that the threshold is soft when both @xmath419 and @xmath420 , while it is hard when both @xmath421 and @xmath178 .",
    "the hard threshold in the general case is given by @xmath422 , and the photon carries away a fraction @xmath423 of the incoming momentum . in the general case at threshold , neither the incoming nor outgoing electron group velocity is equal to the photon phase or group velocity , so the hard erenkov effect can not simply be interpreted as being due to faster than light motion of a charged particle .",
    "the threshold for the process @xmath128 involves only one lv parameter when the electrons all have the same helicity and the positron has the opposite helicity . in the threshold configuration this is allowed by angular momentum conservation , and the form of the spinors ( [ spinorshighe],[pspinorshighe ] ) shows that the amplitude is large as well , so rate will be high above threshold .",
    "it thus suffices to determine the threshold .",
    "suppose the electron has positive helicity , and suppose that @xmath396 , so the reaction will proceed in this configuration .",
    "let the incoming electron have momentum @xmath7 , and let the positron have momentum @xmath424 .",
