    "@xcite for a review .",
    "the o@xmath2- [ equivalently , u@xmath3- ] symmetric system is ubiquitous in nature , and such a characteristic spectrum has been observed for a variety of substances .",
    "the perturbation field ( experimental probe ) should retain the o@xmath2 ( axial ) symmetry @xcite ; otherwise , the contribution from the goldstone excitations smears out the higgs - mode branch @xcite .",
    "( for instance , the chemical - potential modulation for the bosonic system does not conflict with the symmetry . )",
    "recent studies @xcite shed light on a universal character of the spectrum in proximity to the phase transition , especially , in @xmath4 dimensions ; it would be intriguing that the spectral property is also under the reign of universality . in @xmath5 dimensions ,",

    "the method enables us to calculate the low - lying level indexed by quantum numbers . in order to suppress corrections to scaling , we incorporate various types of interaction parameters in addition to the ordinary nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath6 .",
    "thereby , we investigate the universality for the critical amplitude ratio @xmath7 with the higgs mass @xmath8 , the goldstone mass @xmath9 , and the reflected gap @xmath10 with respect to the critical point @xmath11 ; technical details and underlying physics are explained in the next section .",

    "ii of ref .",
    "the linear dimension @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 ; note that the @xmath31 spins constitute a rectangular cluster .",
    "thereby , we evaluated the mass gaps @xmath8 and @xmath9 via the following scheme .",
    "the exact diagonalization method yields the low - lying energy levels @xmath35 explicitly .",
    "each level @xmath36 is specified by the momentum @xmath37 and the perpendicular magnetic moment @xmath38 ; in practice , the numerical diagonalization was performed within the subspace @xmath39 .",
    "the higgs- and goldstone - mass gaps are characterized by @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively . the reflected gap @xmath42 with respect to the critical point @xmath43 is calculated by @xmath10 .",
    "the gap @xmath9 ( @xmath42 ) becomes massive in the paramagnetic ( @xmath1 ) phase @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and hence , the ratio @xmath46 makes sense in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "the gap @xmath47 is interpreted as the insulator gap through regarding the ladder operators @xmath48 as the bosonic creation - annihilation operators .      in this section , we investigate the scaling behaviors for the mass gaps @xmath8 ( [ higgs_mass ] ) and @xmath9 ( [ goldstone_mass ] ) .    in fig .",

    "[ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] collapse into the scaling curves satisfactorily .",
    "such a feature indicates that corrections to scaling are almost negligible owing to the fine adjustment @xcite of the coupling constants to eq .",
    "( [ fp_intro ] ) . because the tractable system size with the exact diagonalization method is severely restricted",
    ", it is significant to accelerate the convergence to the scaling limit .",
    "second , the scaling parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath63 , are taken from the literatures , refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "last , as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] , both mass gaps @xmath49 possess an identical scaling dimension .",
