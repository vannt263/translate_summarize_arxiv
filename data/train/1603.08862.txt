    "a short computation reveals that this is actually equivalent to theorem 1 being valid for the special cases @xmath167 where @xmath168 with @xmath169 .",
    "the main difference to the paper @xcite is that here we perform an immediate reduction to a finite atomic measure space similar as in @xcite , where @xcite , following @xcite , takes the detour via a compact model . to make this precise ,",

    "identity   implies that theorem  [ thm1 ] is true in general if it is true for finite atomic measure spaces .",
    "such spaces are in particular compact , and the remaining part of the proof in the previous section is nothing but an adaptation of the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.15 ) to this special situation .",
    "it is straightfoward to conjecture that also the general results of @xcite , theorem 2.2 - 2.4 , can be proved by a direct reduction to finite atomic measure spaces and avoiding the use of compact models and the sophisticated operator theory presented in section 4 of @xcite .",
