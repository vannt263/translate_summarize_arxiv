    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most luminous persistent sources of high - energy radiation in the universe .",

    "certainly relativistic jets are the most extreme example of the power that can be generated by a smbh in the centre of an agn , with apparent bolometric luminosities up to 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and a large fraction of the power emitted in @xmath1 rays .    before the launch of the _ fermi _ satellite only two classes of agn were known to generate these structures and thus to emit up to the @xmath1-ray energy range : blazars and radio galaxies , both hosted in giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the first two years of observations by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ confirmed that these two are the most numerous classes of identified sources in the extragalactic @xmath1-ray sky @xcite , but the discovery of variable @xmath1-ray emission from 4 radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) revealed the presence of a possible emerging third class of agn with relativistic jets @xcite .",

    "this is in agreement with the idea that magn are less beamed than blazars . in this context",
    "it is interesting to consider also the @xmath1-ray nls1s . for a direct comparison with the results shown in @xcite we calculated the flux and photon index over the third year of _ fermi _ operation in the 0.1 - 10 gev energy band , resulting in @xmath54 = 2.19 @xmath5 0.06 and flux ( 0.110 gev ) = ( 6.6@xmath50.6 )",

    "one of the key questions is the maximum power released by the jets of nls1s . during the @xmath1-ray flaring activity observed in 2011 june ",
    "july sbs 0846@xmath0513 reached an observed isotropic @xmath1-ray luminosity ( 0.1300 gev ) of 1.0@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 on daily timescales , comparable to that of luminous fsrqs .",
    "after pmn j0948@xmath00022 @xcite , this is the second nls1 observed to generate such a high power .",
    "this could be an indication that all the radio - loud nls1s are able to host relativistic jets as powerful as those in blazars , despite the lower bh mass ; alternatively some nls1s could have peculiar characteristics allowing the development of these relativistic jets .",
    "the mechanism at work for producing a relativistic jet is not clear , and the physical parameters that drive jet formation is still under debate .",
    "one fundamental parameter could be the black hole mass , with only large masses allowing for the efficient formation of a relativistic jet .",
    "it was for example noted by some authors @xcite that quasars with @xmath57 reach radio loudness 3 orders of magnitude greater than quasars with @xmath58 . the large radio loudness of sbs 0846@xmath0513 could challenge this idea if the black hole masses estimated by @xcite are confirmed .",
    "according to the `` modified spin paradigm '' discussed in @xcite , another fundamental parameter for the efficiency of a relativistic jet production should be the bh spin , with smbhs in elliptical galaxies having on average much larger spins than smbhs in spiral galaxies .",
    "this is due to the fact that spiral galaxies are characterized by multiple accretion events with random orientation of angular momentum vectors and small increments of mass , while elliptical galaxies underwent at least one major merger with large matter accretion triggering an efficient spin up of the smbh .",
    "the accretion rate ( thus the mass ) and the spin of the black hole may be related to the host galaxy , leading to the hypothesis that relativistic jets can develop only in elliptical galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this context the discovery of relativistic jets in a class of agn usually hosted by spiral galaxies , such as the nls1s",

    "we note that bh masses of radio - loud nls1s are generally larger with respect to the entire sample of nls1s ( @xmath61 * ? ? ?",

    "the larger bh masses of radio - loud nls1s with respect to radio - quiet nls1s could be related to prolonged accretion episodes that can spin - up the bhs .",
    "the small fraction of radio - loud nls1s with respect to radio - loud quasars could be an indication that in the former the high accretion usually does not last sufficiently long to significantly spin - up the bh @xcite .    of the @xmath1-ray emitting nls1s ,",
    "host galaxy imaging is available only for 1h 0323@xmath0342 , with hst and the nordic optical telescope .",

    "<S> a significant increase in activity was observed during 2010 october2011 august . in particular </S>",
    "<S> a strong @xmath1-ray flare was observed in 2011 june reaching an isotropic @xmath1-ray luminosity ( 0.1300 gev ) of 1.0@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , comparable to that of the brightest flat spectrum radio quasars , and showing spectral evolution in @xmath1 rays . </S>",
    "<S> an apparent superluminal velocity of ( 8.2@xmath51.5)@xmath6 in the jet was inferred from 2011 - 2012 vlba images , suggesting the presence of a highly relativistic jet .    </S>",
    "<S> both the power released by this object during the flaring activity and the apparent superluminal velocity are strong indications of the presence of a relativistic jet as powerful as those of blazars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , variability and spectral properties in radio and @xmath1-ray bands indicate blazar - like behaviour , suggesting that , except for some distinct optical characteristics , sbs 0846@xmath0513 could be considered as a young blazar at the low end of the blazar s black hole mass distribution .    </S>",
