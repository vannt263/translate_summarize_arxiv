    "a pentaquark structure @xmath7 has also been proposed @xcite . nevertheless , the mass of the @xmath0 , that is lighter than the @xmath8 , and the large spin - orbit splitting between the @xmath0 and @xmath9 were difficult to understand in the quark model picture .",
    "the @xmath0 has been considered as a quasibound molecular state of the @xmath10 system for many years @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are experimental evidences that the @xmath0 resonance , which has been observed in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution , is mostly a @xmath10 and/or @xmath2 composite @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath0 lies just @xmath11 mev below the @xmath10 threshold and has a strong influence in the low - energy @xmath10 data @xcite .",

    "dispersion relations can be used to perform the necessary resummation of the chiral perturbation theory amplitudes at any order @xcite . in particular , the kaonic hydrogen data are used to constrain the meson - baryon coupled - channel amplitudes , giving rise to a more precise determination of the location of the two poles .",

    "the scattering amplitude for the channels @xmath92 and @xmath93 close to the resonance pole at @xmath94 can be approximated as @xmath95 .",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite the amplitude in the present study exhibits two poles at @xmath96 and @xmath97 mev .",
    "both poles are situated on the same riemann sheet . as the size of the couplings in table  [ tab : coupl ] shows , the lighter state couples predominantly to the @xmath2 channel while the heavier state couples stronger to the @xmath3 channel .",
    "if the transitions between these channels are set to zero , the lighter state is still present as a resonance in the @xmath2 channel while the heavier state becomes a bound state in the @xmath3 channel .",

    "the magnitudes of these couplings provides an idea of the strength of the coupling between the bound state and the meson - baryon channel .",
    "however , it is known that a coupling @xmath100 to a channel @xmath92 , that opens far above the state , might be large although that channel is irrelevant for the wave function of the state .",
    "it is therefore more realistic to consider the relative weight @xmath101 of a channel in the wave function of a state , @xmath102 , which fulfills the identity @xcite , @xmath103 the above equation can be regarded as the generalized version of the weinberg compositeness condition for the coupled - channel case .",

    "when these quantities take complex values ( as for resonances ) , it is not possible to interpret them as probabilities but these magnitudes are rather extrapolations of probability in the complex plane of the energy @xcite . the first term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ eq : compw ] ) , @xmath111 , equals @xmath112 , not @xmath113 @xcite .",

    "the lowest state is a resonance above the @xmath2 threshold . when the mass of the pion increases , the lower state becomes a cusp , i.e.",
    ", the pole is close to threshold , but on a sheet that is not directly accessible from the physical axis .",

    "a third state appears at higher energies .",
    "this state couples more to the channels @xmath50 and @xmath22 , with larger coupling strength to @xmath22 .",

    "in this table , @xmath189 and @xmath190 denote the distances to the @xmath10 and @xmath2 thresholds , where the negative sign means that the state is above threshold .",
    "for masses below @xmath161 mev , we observe that the second state in the finite volume has a dominant @xmath10 component , and is between the @xmath2 and @xmath10 thresholds .",
    "it shares these properties with the higher - lying pole of the @xmath0 in the infinite volume .",
    "we can understand the proximity of finite- and infinite - volume states as follows : the second @xmath0 pole is a quasi- bound @xmath3 state with little influence from the @xmath2 channel . in the finite volume",
    ", the eigenstate appears therefore almost as a bound state . in the limit of zero @xmath2 coupling ,",
    "the position of finite- and infinite - volume poles would differ only by exponentially suppressed corrections scaling with the binding momentum . on the contrary",
    ", the lower state shows very different properties in the infinite volume limit and in the box .",
    "as discussed , for low pion masses , the finite - volume state below the @xmath2 threshold is related to the lower @xmath0 pole only insofar , that it indicates the attractive @xmath2 interaction leading to the generation of the pole in the infinite volume ( at a very different position ) .",
    "for high pion masses , the lower @xmath0 pole in the infinite volume limit becomes a bound state , and then the couplings to all the channels become very similar to the ones in the box as one can see from table [ tab : couplfi ] .",

    "@xcite , where we observe the presence of two resonances related to the two poles near the energy of the @xmath0 . for higher pion masses",

    "the heavier pole of the @xmath197 couples predominantly to the @xmath25 channel as the figure in the upper left corner shows . as the pion mass increases ,",
    "the pole remains close to the @xmath25 threshold as a quasi - bound state .",
    "the fact that the second pole of the @xmath0 always appears close to the @xmath10 threshold may be due to that the kaon mass , which controls the strength of the @xmath198 weinberg - tomozawa term , does not change much , so that the properties of the bound state also do not experience much variations .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath199 weinberg - tomozawa interaction becomes significantly stronger with increasing pion mass , changing drastically the nature of the lower state from resonance to bound state .",

    "this energy level shows a large coupling and overlap with the @xmath10 channel and has similar properties as the higher pole of the @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite , that appears here below the @xmath2 threshold , indicating an attractive @xmath2 interaction . in the infinite volume",
    ", this attraction leads to the generation of a second ( lighter ) pole of the @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is universal in u@xmath1pt calculations , and also present in some dynamical coupled - channel approaches . here",
    ", we have assumed that this absence is due to the absence of meson - baryon operators in the operator base used in ref .",
    "@xcite . to propose suitable meson - baryon operators for the detection of the threshold level ,",
    "we have considered the finite - volume analog of @xmath153 that specify the relative weight of a channel in a state s wave function .",
    "it turns out that an operator of the @xmath2 type is most suited to detect the level in future lattice simulations .",
    "indeed , the precise location of that level would specify the size of attraction in the @xmath2 channel at threshold and help to pin down the location of the lighter @xmath0 pole that is notoriously difficult to determine .",
    "also , a precise determination of the pole positions from lattice data requires to populate the region between the @xmath2 and @xmath25 thresholds with more lattice eigenvalues , using , e.g. , moving frames and asymmetric boxes @xcite . also , higher - order u@xmath1pt calculations along the lines of refs .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 baryon is difficult to detect in experiment , absent in many quark model calculations , and supposedly manifested through a two - pole structure . </S>",
    "<S> its uncommon properties made it subject to numerous experimental and theoretical studies in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> lattice - qcd eigenvalues for different quark masses were recently reported by the adelaide group . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these eigenvalues to predictions of a model based on unitary chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the u@xmath1pt calculation predicts the quark mass dependence remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> it also predicts the overlap pattern with different meson - baryon components , mainly @xmath2 and @xmath3 , at different quark masses , which might help in the construction of meson - baryon operators for improved level detection on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> more accurate lattice qcd data are required to draw definite conclusions on the nature of the @xmath0 . </S>"
