    "the former describes a fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere in a @xmath3-field of @xmath43 g . during the fits ,",
    "the stellar mass was fixed at 1.4@xmath44 and we assumed uniform thermal emission over the entire surface of 13 km radius .",
    "this yields a fit that is equally as good as the bb+pl model , but with a significantly lower surface temperature of @xmath45kev .",
    "the flux normalization suggests a distance of @xmath46kpc , which is lower than the source distance of 8.4kpc .",

    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : psrspec](a ) , the pulsar flux below 2.5kev is mostly thermal , and it is highly pulsed and shows good phase alignment with the radio pulse ( figure  [ fig : pulse ] ) . combining these two results suggests that the thermal emission could be dominated by a single hot spot near the magnetic pole .",
    "further support for this picture is provided by the phase - resolved spectroscopy , which suggests a hint of a higher temperature for the on - pulse emission than the off - pulse emission ( figure  [ fig : psrspec](b ) ) .",
    "the bb+pl fit to the phase - averaged spectrum gives a high temperature of @xmath52kev ( @xmath161mk ) with an emission radius of @xmath36 km , implying a bolometric luminosity of @xmath162ergs@xmath40  for the thermal emission .",
    "the bb temperature and luminosity are among the highest of radio pulsars , even when compared to objects with similar age ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "since the stellar surface temperature is non - uniform , the nsa fits only give the average temperature and it can not be directly compared to the bb temperature . indeed , the bolometric luminosity above is equivalent to that of a 13 km radius star with a uniform temperature of 0.096kev ( = 1.1mk ) , comparable to the best - fit nsa temperature of @xmath45kev .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that the bb luminosity and radius are too large to be reconciled with polar cap heating by return currents from the magnetosphere .",
    "hence , the thermal emission is likely from cooling and its unusual properties , e.g.  high temperature and large modulation , could be related to the strong magnetic field of psr j1119@xmath06127 .",
    "@xcite noticed an apparent correlation between the bb temperature @xmath163 and the dipole @xmath3-field @xmath164 of neutron stars , with @xmath165 spanning over three orders of magnitude in @xmath164 , from radio pulsars to magnetars .",
    "they attributed this to crustal heating by magnetic field decay , and subsequently studied the `` magneto - thermal evolution '' of neutron stars @xcite . in their model , heating from field decay increases the magnetic diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the crust , which in turn accelerates the field decay .",
    "as a result , neutron stars born with initial @xmath3-fields @xmath166 g could have a surface temperature well above the minimal cooling scenario @xcite .",
    "the thermal emission of psr j1119@xmath06127  offers an interesting test case for the above theory .",
    "while the bb temperature we obtained is comparable to the predicted value at the pole @xcite , the bolometric luminosity of @xmath167ergs@xmath40  could be easily explained by passive cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus , providing no evidence for energy injection from @xmath3-field decay .",
    "indeed , the higher temperature at the pole could be attributed to anisotropic heat conduction . since free electrons , which are the main heat carriers ,",
    "are confined to the magnetic field lines , heat transport perpendicular to the field is strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "this acts as a `` heat blanket '' at the magnetic equator , while the magnetic poles are in thermal equilibrium with the core . as a result ,",
    "the surface temperature distribution is non - uniform with warmer spots at the magnetic poles separated by cooler regions at lower magnetic latitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is believed that the internal magnetic field of a neutron star likely consists of a toroidal component , which could be generated by differential rotation that wraps the poloidal field in a proto - neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the presence of a toroidal @xmath3-field in the crust could further suppress the heat transport from the core towards the magnetar equator , because that requires crossing the toroidal field lines . as a result , this would enhance the heat blanket effect .",
    "moreover , since the toroidal field component is symmetric about the magnetic equator but the poloidal component is antisymmetric , the total @xmath3-field would be asymmetric .",
    "hence , the thermal emission from one magnetic pole could dominate over another , which could help explain the single - peaked pulse profile we found .",

    "we have carried out spectral analysis of three brightest regions in snr g292.2@xmath00.5 .",
    "the spectra are well - described by absorbed two - component models . while the best - fit absorption column densities of the pulsar and region 1 are consistent ( @xmath190 ) , the values are lower for regions 2 and 3 ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "these seem to suggest an east - west gradient of @xmath33  across the field .",
    "this is more evident in the three - color image in figure  [ fig : img ] : the western part of the snr is redder than the eastern part , indicating a softer spectrum which could be due to a lower absorption .",
    "this trend is consistent with previous findings @xcite , and can be attributed to a dark molecular cloud dc 292.3@xmath00.4 to the east of the pulsar as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the snr emission consists of a soft thermal component with @xmath192kev and a hard component that can be described either by a non - thermal pl of photon index @xmath193 or by high temperature non - equilibrium ionization plasma with @xmath194kev .",
    "while non - thermal synchrotron emission is often observed in young snrs , the pl photon index we found ( @xmath195 ) is higher than the typical values of 23 in other systems ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the fit statistics are slightly worse than that of the two - temperature model .",
    "these seem to suggest that the latter may be a more plausible model . in this case , the solar abundances of the high - temperature plasma suggest a circumstellar or interstellar origin , hence , the reverse shock probably has not yet propagated through the ejecta . together with the high temperature and small ionization timescales , these provide support for the young age of the system .",
    "the emission measure could give us a handle on the ambient density @xmath196 .",
    "assuming a slab geometry for the emitting regions with thickness equal to the width , and taking an electron - to - proton density ratio of 1.2 and a shock compression ratio of 4 , we obtained @xmath197@xmath95 in all three regions .",
    "the low - temperature component , however , is more difficult to interpret .",
    "following the same calculation , we estimate @xmath196 of 0.6 , 0.03 , and 0.07@xmath95 in regions 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "this could suggest dense clump for region 1 . for regions 2 and 3 ,",
    "a comparison to the large ionization timescales ( @xmath198s@xmath95 ) indicates that the plasma could have been shocked @xmath199yr ago , which seems difficult to reconcile with the snr emission .",
    "as we suggest below , the emission may arise from the progenitor wind interaction with the surrounding .    at a distance of 8.4kpc ,",
    "the 85-radius snr shell has a physical size of 21pc @xcite .",
    "such a large radius at a young age requires a high average expansion rate of @xmath200kms@xmath40 .",
    "if this is the present - day shock velocity , then the proton temperature would be @xmath201kev , where @xmath202 is the proton mass , and an adiabatic index of @xmath203 and cosmic abundances ( i.e. , 90% h and 10% he ) are assumed .",
    "a comparison to the best - fit @xmath204kev implies an electron - to - proton temperature ratio of @xmath205 , lower than in most snrs observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if the ambient medium has a uniform density of @xmath206 as estimated above , then the swept - up mass would be @xmath207 , much larger than the typical ejecta mass of @xmath208 .",
    "hence , the remnant could be in a transition to the adiabatic phase .",
    "based on the sedov solution , @xcite derived a constraint on the ratio between @xmath196 ( in @xmath95 ) and the explosion energy @xmath209 in units of @xmath210erg . the updated distance and age estimates from @xcite and @xcite",
    "imply @xmath211 , requiring an exceptionally large explosion energy or a very low ambient density .",
    "it has been proposed that a newborn neutron star with magnetar - like @xmath3-field ( @xmath212 g ) and a short spin period ( @xmath213ms ) would spin down quickly via magnetic braking . as a result",
    ", the huge amount of rotational energy released ( @xmath214erg ) could accelerate the snr expansion @xcite .",
    "while we can not rule out this possibility , the explosion energies of three snrs associated with magnetars ( kes 73 , ctb 109 , and n49 ) are found to be close to the canonical value of @xmath210erg @xcite , which is not consistent with this hypothesis .    as an alternative",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario was briefly mentioned by @xcite and here we further explore this idea .",
    "@xcite discussed different types of core collapse supernovae and the properties of their remnants .",
    "type iip and iil / b supernovae are the end products of red supergiants ( rsgs ) , which have initial masses @xmath215 and @xmath216 , respectively @xcite , and they are surrounded by dense circumstellar rsg winds extending to a few pc .",
    "in contrast , supernovae of type ib / c are believed to originate from wolf - rayet ( wr ) progenitors , which are massive stars @xmath217 with high mass - loss rates and high - velocity winds , which are about two orders of magnitudes faster than rsg winds .",
    "for a wr star evolved from an rsg , the fast wr wind would sweep up the slow rsg wind ejected earlier to evacuate a low - density wind bubble of radius @xmath218pc over the lifetime @xmath219yr of the wr phase @xcite .",
    "the swept - up shell is characterized by clumpy structure due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , and overabundance in n and underabundance in c and o @xcite .",
    "we argue that snr g292.2@xmath00.5  is unlikely to be a type iip or iil / b supernova because in these cases the remnant should expand into the dense circumstellar rsg winds .",
    "a type ib / c event with a wr progenitor , one of the possibilities mentioned by @xcite , therefore seems more likely . in this picture , the snr had a long free - expansion phase in the low - density wind bubble , with the initial expansion rate up to a few times @xmath220kms@xmath40 , as seen in sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "when the shock reached the cavity boundary at large radius , it began to encounter the clumpy swept - up shell and hence decelerated .",
    "the shock interaction then gave rise to the observed hard component in the spectra , either thermal or non - thermal .",
    "this scenario may be able to explain the soft component too .",
    "the large ionization timescales of the emission are comparable to the lifetime of the wr phase , suggesting that it may originate from the swept - up rsg wind .",
    "two wr bubbles have been detected in x - rays and their spectra can be fitted by a two - temperature thermal model with @xmath221 and 1kev @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature component is comparable to what we observed for snr g292.2@xmath00.5 , while the low - temperature component may be too absorbed to detect in our case .",
    "in addition , hydrodynamic simulations and observations suggest a density of @xmath222@xmath95 in the hot bubbles @xcite , which is also consistent with our findings .",
    "deeper x - ray observations in the future can probe the chemical composition of the circumstellar medium to confirm its nature .",
    "moreover , if the snr is detected in optical wavelengths , then spectral line observations could directly measure the shock velocity to reveal the evolutionary state of the remnant .",
    "in addition to psr j1119@xmath06127 , only two other young high-@xmath3 radio pulsars have associated snrs detected : psr j1846@xmath00258 in kes 75 and psr b1509@xmath058 in msh 15@xmath05__2__. intriguingly , both of them were claimed to have a wr progenitor @xcite .",
    "there is also observational evidence hinting at a similar mass range for magnetar progenitors , e.g. , 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 , cxou j1647@xmath04552 , and sgr 1806@xmath020 @xcite , although intermediate masses were suggested for two cases : 1e 1841@xmath0045 and sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite .",
    "this raises the important question regarding a possible correlation between progenitor mass and neutron star magnetic field .",
    "recently , @xcite compared different classes of young neutron stars in snrs , including magnetars , radio pulsars , and central compact objects , and suggested a tendency for higher @xmath3-field objects to have more massive progenitors .",
    "however , it was noted that other parameters , such as rotation , metallicity , and binarity , likely also play an important role .",
    "the origin of magnetic fields in neutron stars has long been an open problem .",
    "theories suggest that it could be the fossil @xmath3-fields of the progenitors preserved during core collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or from field amplification via an @xmath175@xmath223 dynamo in rapidly rotating stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a positive correlation between progenitor mass and neutron star @xmath3-field may be expected in both scenarios @xcite .",
    "massive stars tend to have higher surface @xmath3-fields @xcite .",
    "they also spend less time in the hydrogen and helium burning phases , during which significant braking occurs .",
    "hence , the core could retain a large angular momentum , resulting in efficient dynamo action .",
    "if further studies confirm that the progenitors of high-@xmath3 radio pulsars and magnetars have comparable mass , then no matter which of the above mechanisms is at work , the @xmath3-fields in these objects could be generated in a similar way . in this respect",
    ", magnetars could have the same formation channel as radio pulsars , which would support a unification of these classes of objects @xcite .",
    "we performed a detailed x - ray study of the young high-@xmath3 radio pulsar j1119@xmath06127 and its associated snr g292.2@xmath00.5  using deep _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra_observations .",
    "the pulsar emission exhibits strong pulsations below 2.5kev , with a single - peaked profile that aligns with the radio pulse .",
    "such a single - peaked profile and alignment seem common among thermally emitting high-@xmath3 pulsars , and we showed that the observed pulsed profile can be modeled by a large hot spot near the magnetic pole .",
    "the pulsar spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed bb plus pl model .",
    "the bb temperature @xmath35kev is highest among young radio pulsars .",
    "the thermal emission has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath224ergs@xmath40 , which is consistent with neutron star cooling and no heating by @xmath3-field decay is needed .",
    "however , passive magnetic effects , including anisotropic heat conduction and beaming , must play a part in the high temperature and large modulation of the emission .",
    "the spectra of snr g292.2@xmath00.5  are best fitted by a two - component model with solar abundances .",
    "the soft component has a thermal origin with @xmath225kev and a large ionization timescale , while the hard component can be described either by a pl with @xmath193 or by higher temperature ( @xmath194kev ) thermal emission with low ionization . for a young age of 1900yr inferred from the pulsar s spin down , the 21pc snr shell diameter ( at a distance of 8.4kpc )",
    "implies a fast expansion in the past",
