    "the galaxy three - point function provides a valuable statistical tool to investigate the nature of the relationship between galaxies and dark matter and to probe the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations through constraints on primordial non - gaussianity ( see bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) .",
    "measurements of the three - point function and other higher - order statistics in galaxy catalogs have a rich history ( peebles & groth 1975 , fry & peebles 1978 , baumgart & fry 1991 , gaztaaga 1992 , bouchet et al .",
    "1993 , fry & gaztaaga 1994 ) . in the past decade , three - point statistics have confirmed the basic picture of gravitational instability from gaussian initial conditions ( frieman & gaztaaga 1994 , jing & brner 1998 , frieman & gaztaaga 1999 , feldman et al .",
    "the impact of such measurements on theoretical models has been important but the systematic and statistical uncertainties in the data have been non - negligible , primarily because the connection between these statistics and theoretical predictions is best done on large scales , where the physics is best understood , and the surveys previously available were not large enough .    in recent years , with the completion of large redshift surveys such as 2dfgrs ( colless et al .",
    "2001 ) and sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) the measurement of higher - order statistics promises to provide tight constraints at the few percent level ( colombi et al .",

    "2004 , sefusatti & scoccimarro 2004 ) that will help significantly in pinning down the cosmological parameters and issues in galaxy formation that have an impact on galaxy clustering .",

    "in this paper we study the three - point function with particular emphasis on redshift - space distortions and galaxy bias .",
    "there is a puzzling result regarding previous investigations of the 3-point function in redshift ( configuration ) space ( suto & matsubara 1994 , matsubara & suto 1994 , jing & brner 1998 , jing & brner 2004 ) .",
    "they all find very little dependence of the 3-point function on triangle configuration at small scales ( both in simulations and observations ) . this result is puzzling because one of the first things that brings attention to our eyes is the presence of the  fingers of god \" in redshift - space distributions , produced by the radial component of galaxy peculiar velocities inside clusters .",
    "these rather long and thin structures should leave a clear imprint in the 3-point correlation function , with higher amplitudes for collapsed triangles . why has this feature not been observed so far ?",
    "we also study the three - point function as a probe of galaxy bias in the framework of current surveys , and provide a detailed framework for computing reliable error estimates on bias parameters that include the covariance matrix due to non - linearities and survey geometry .",
    "we use a battery of n - body simulations and mock catalogs extracted from them with different biasing prescriptions .",
    "our presentation follows closely the eigenmode analysis method developed for the bispectrum ( scoccimarro 2000 ) .    a first paper of this series ( barriga & gaztaaga 2002 , paper i ) presented a comparison of the predictions for the two and three - point correlation functions of density fluctuations , @xmath4 and @xmath0 , in gravitational perturbation theory ( pt ) against large cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations . here",
    "we extend these results into the non - linear regime and focus on the effects of redshift distortions and the extraction of galaxy bias parameters in galaxy surveys .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ 3pt ]",
    "we review the basic definitions involving the three - point function . in section  [ simu ]",
    "we present the simulations and mock catalogs , whereas in section  [ zdist ] we study the effects of redshift distortions from large to small scales . in section  [ getbias ]",
    "we study in detail how to recover bias parameters from current galaxy catalogs .",
    "the two and three - point correlation functions are defined , respectively , as ( r_12 ) & = & ( r_1 ) ( r_2 ) + ( r_12,r_23,r_13 ) & = & ( r_1 ) ( r_2 ) ( r_3 ) where @xmath5 is the local density fluctuation about the mean @xmath6 , and the expectation value is take over different realizations of the model or physical process . in practice ,",
    "the expectation value is over different spatial positions in our universe , which are assumed to be a fair sample of possible realizations ( see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "it is convenient to define a @xmath3 parameter as follows  @xcite @xmath7 where we have introduced a definition for the `` hierarchical '' three - point function @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter was thought to be roughly constant as a function of triangle shape and scale  @xcite , a result that is usually referred to as the hierarchical scaling . as we will see below ,",
    "accurate measurements / predictions show that @xmath3 is not quite constant in any regime of clustering , although the variations of @xmath3 with scale are small compared to the corresponding changes in @xmath4 or @xmath0 .",
    "there are two parametrizations that are commonly used in the literature to describe the three parameters that define a triangle , each of which has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "since we are studying the monopole of the three - point function ( averaged over all orientations of the triangle with respect to the observer ) , this depends on three variables .",
    "one obvious choice is the magnitude of the three sides of the triangle , described by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is reasonable since the three variables are on an equal footing ( being three lengths ) and if the measurement is done with some typical resolution due to the three - point function algorithm , it affects all of them in the same way .",
    "the two most common parametrizations , however , involve a length scale , a dimensionless number ( ratio of lengths ) , and some measure of triangle shape ( another ratio of lengths or an angle ) . in this case",
    "the three variables may be affected by resolution ( e.g. binning ) in different ways .",
    "this can be important for example for the dependence on triangle shape , which is what concerns us here regarding the signature of fingers of god at small scales .",
    "in perturbation theory , it has been customary to use the two sides of the triangle @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( which are typically comparable in side ) and the angle @xmath9 between them :    cos()= r_12 .",
    "r_23 with @xmath16 deg . for small scales",
    "it has been popular to use @xmath14 and @xmath15 , but with later given by the ratio : u= r_23/r_12 , and the third parameter given by : v with the restriction @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is related to @xmath9 by : v = - u in principle @xmath18 , but the restriction @xmath17 only allows @xmath19 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath20 corresponds to @xmath21 . note how in this parametrization the small values of @xmath9 are only recovered for large values of @xmath22 .",
    "for example , for @xmath23 we are restricted to @xmath24 deg .",
    "this can have implications for the detection of sharp dependencies on triangle shape , as we shall see in section  [ zdist ] .",
    "elongated or  collapsed configurations \" are those with @xmath25 or @xmath26 deg ; or in terms of @xmath10 , those with @xmath10 close to unity . configurations of triangles with @xmath27 are called here  perpendicular \" configurations . in terms of @xmath10",
    "they correspond to small values of @xmath10 , but note that there is no one - to - one correspondence .",
    "small values of @xmath10 could also arise for triangles with @xmath28 even if @xmath14 is not small .",
    "we use the term `` strong configuration dependence '' when there is a significance difference between the collapsed and the perpendicular configurations . by `` weak configuration dependence '' we mean that @xmath3 is hierarchical ( ie constant as a function of @xmath9 ) .

    "the 22 2dfgrs and 100 hv mocks will be used to estimate errors and covariance matrices ( see  4 ) .",

    "this can _ and should always _ be checked against numerical realizations of the particular survey geometry and scales being studied , otherwise the outcome of the likelihood analysis could be significantly biased , even if the covariance between different triangles is taken into account . here",
    "we explore the validity of the gaussian likelihood approximation for the three - point function , extending similar studies done for the bispectrum ( scoccimarro 2000 ) and higher - order moments ( szapudi et al .",

    "the gaussian approximation should become better as more such triangles contribute to its @xmath3 and although one is adding correlated quantities , one naively expects to reach the central limit theorem if the correlations are small .",
    "however , it is not obvious this is enough because at the same time the error bars for the bias parameters shrink , and thus a small systematic bias ( if comparable to the small error bars ) can still affect the determination of parameters .",
    "a simple rule of thumb is to compute the skewness of the distribution of @xmath3 and check whether this is much smaller than the shift in @xmath3 that results from displacing @xmath31 by the error bars , if so the systematic error that results from assuming gaussianity can perhaps be safely ignored ( see discussion in hui & gaztaaga 1999 , scoccimarro 2000 and szapudi et al .",

[ pdq3 ] the dimensionless skewness of the distribution is @xmath74 , which translates in a bias of about @xmath75 in the estimated @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant distribution in our method is not so much the distribution of @xmath3 , but the distribution of the q - eigenmodes .",

    "the fainter samples with higher density do not cover a large enough volume .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to fig .  9 in sefusatti & scoccimarro ( 2004 ) .",
    "we have studied the three - point function amplitude @xmath3 in dark matter and mock galaxies with particular emphasis on the effects of redshift - space distortions and galaxy biasing .    whereas the dependence of @xmath3 on triangle shape is partialy erased in redshift space on large scales @xmath95 , at smaller scales @xmath3 develops a characteristic u - shape anisotropy due to the effects of velocity dispersion .",
    "this is expected based on visual inspection of the distribution in redshift space ( the finger of god effects ) . but nevertheless , it has not been detected before in simulations nor observations .",
    "we studied why this is so and concluded that low resolution in the configuration angle @xmath9 can suppress this sharp feature due to mixing of collapsed configurations ( which are few ) with the more numerous ( with much less amplitude ) configurations away from @xmath96 deg .",
    "this problem can be exacerbated by using the @xmath10 parameter as a probe of angle ( instead of @xmath9 ) , which has been a common choice in small - scale studies .",
    "moreover , errors are largest for the collapsed configurations , which both makes it more difficult to detect and is subject to larger estimation biases .",
    "our detection of the u - shape anisotropy is completely analogous to the results from the small - scale bispectrum , which shows a very similar effect ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1999 ) , and we see it in every cosmological model and including galaxy bias ( see figs .  [ q3zr1 ] ,  [ q3gal ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the redshift - space three - point function _ does not _ follow the hierarchical ansatz at small scales ( less than 6 mpc / h ) , much less so than in real - space , contrary to statements in the literature . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ scale _ dependence of @xmath3 is weakly suppressed in redshift - space when compared to real - space , thus if the u - shape anisotropy of @xmath3 is missed due to poor resolution , a hierarchical three - point function becomes a good model .",
    "we presented a detailed method for obtaining constraints on galaxy bias parameters from measurements of @xmath3 in current galaxy redshift surveys , based on the q - eigenmode analysis developed for the bispectrum ( scoccimarro 2000 ) .",
    "we showed that the covariance matrix of @xmath3 has non negligible extra diagonal components and presented an svd inversion method that can be stable even if too few mock catalogs are used for the computation of the covariance matrix , with the only drawback in this case being an overestimate of the error bars .",
    "we studied the gaussianity of the likelihood function and showed that for surveys such as 2dfgrs gaussianity is a good approximation for the distribution of the q - eigenmodes , although some small skewness is present .",
    "we discussed the sensitivity of @xmath3 to bias parameters as a function of the scale included in the analysis , and presented results for how well we can expect to recover the linear and quadratic bias parameters in the case of 2dfgrs .",
    "we showed that our method recovers the bias parameters introduced into mock galaxies by an hod prescription and is also able to handle potential systematics in case a smaller number than ideal of mock catalogs is used to estimate the covariance matrix .",
    "we thank andreas berlind for making available to us the sdss mock catalogs corresponding to @xmath97 and @xmath98 and naoki yoshida for help with the vls simulations .",
    "we also thank carlton baugh , darren croton and peder norberg for making the 2dfgrs and hv mocks available and for comments to the manuscript . we acknowledge support from the spanish ministerio de ciencia i tecnologia , project aya2002 - 00850 with ec - feder funding and grants nsf phy-0101738 and nasa nag5 - 12100 .",
