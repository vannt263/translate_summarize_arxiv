    "<S> the branching ratio for the @xmath1 decay is about @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs particle would be a narrow object ( width about @xmath3 kev ) , and its mass might be consistent with the value given by typical estimates of radiative effects measured by the lep experiments .    </S>",

    "<S> +    to appear in physics letters b.    as far as the mass generation within the framework of the standard electroweak model is concerned , one must differentiate between the mass generation for the electroweak bosons @xmath4 , @xmath5 , the mass generation for the heavy @xmath0 quark , and the generation of mass for the leptons and the five remaining , relatively light quarks . while there exists no freedom in the choice of the interaction strengths of the weak bosons with the scalar field , which is dictated by the gauge invariance @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , there is such a freedom with respect to the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the fermions are given by the various yukawa coupling constants , which parametrize the interactions of the leptons and quarks with the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> the yukawa coupling constant of the @xmath0 quark field is of the same order as the gauge coupling constant , while the other fermions couple much weakly ( @xmath6 for the @xmath7 quark , @xmath8 for the @xmath9 quark , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the light fermion masses is still mysterious , and alternative views or slight variations of the standard electroweak theory might indeed give a different view . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the observed flavor mixing phenomenon , one could speculate , for example , that the masses of the light quarks and of the leptons are due to the mixing . in the absence of the mixing the mass matrix of the quarks in the @xmath10-sector </S>",
    "<S> would simply be proportional to a diagonal matrix with the entries @xmath11 , and there would only be a coupling of the scalar field to the @xmath0 quark . </S>",
    "<S> once the flavor mixing is switched on , the mass eigenstates for the light quarks are not necessarily coupled to the scalar field , with a strength given by the mass eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> in particular these couplings could remain zero .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the renormalizability of the theory requires a coupling of the fermion to the scalar field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the unitarity in the @xmath12 channel is violated at high energies for the reaction @xmath13 .    however , for all fermions except the @xmath0 quark these problems appear only at extremely high energies . </S>",
    "<S> modifications of the electroweak theory , which involve an energy scale not orders of magnitude above the typical electroweak scale of about @xmath14 tev , e.g. theories which do not rely on the higgs mechanism , can take care of this problem .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we have discussed such a modification @xcite , or rather an alternative description of the standard model , based on the complementarity between confinement and higgs phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that the electroweak interactions are described by the confinement phase , and not by the higgs phase , as usually assumed . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an alternative view of the electroweak bosons , which are not the basic gauge bosons of the underlying gauge theory , but `` bound states '' of an underlying scalar field , which in the higgs phase plays the role of the higgs doublet . </S>",
    "<S> both the charged @xmath4 bosons and the neutral @xmath5 boson are @xmath15 bound systems of the type @xmath16 or @xmath17 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there is a corresponding @xmath18 , @xmath17 system , which is to be identified with higgs boson of the standard electroweak model .    in a simple non - relativistic picture of these bound states </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 wave state would in general have a mass less than the mass of the @xmath19 wave state , e.g. the higgs bosons would have a mass below @xmath20 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this need not be the case here , due to relativistic effects , and due to the complicated interplay between the confining gauge force and the scalar self - interaction , but nevertheless the mass of the higgs boson is not expected to be very large compared to the @xmath4 boson . the mass splitting between the higgs boson and the @xmath4 boson could be calculated using the lattice approximation , but since this has not yet been done , we are not able to make predictions for the higgs mass .    we shall consider a deviation from our original model which would have the same couplings as in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that in the confinement phase of the electroweak theory the coupling strength of the fermions to the scalar boson are not proportional to the light fermion masses , since these couplings depend strongly on the dynamics of the model . in the simplest case </S>",
    "<S> only the fermion whose mass is of the same order as the weak interaction energy scale , i.e. , the @xmath0 quark , has such a coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus we proceed to calculate the properties of the scalar boson , which couples only to the @xmath0 quark . as far as the interaction of such a boson with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons is concerned </S>",
    "<S> , there is no change in comparison to the standard electroweak model . </S>",
    "<S> however there is a substantial change of the decay properties . </S>",
    "<S> decay modes which were regarded as being strongly suppressed become dominant .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider the following decay channels for the higgs boson : @xmath21 ( see graph [ graph1 ] ) via a top quark triangle and @xmath22 ( see graphs [ graph2 ] , [ graph3 ] and [ graph4 ] ) via a triangle involving top quarks and charged electroweak bosons or a bubble diagram involving a neutral electroweak boson . </S>",
    "<S> for a two photon higgs decay , ignoring radiative corrections , one finds @xcite @xmath23 where the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath27 where @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the first function corresponds to the contribution of the top quark and the second to the contribution of the charged @xmath4 bosons . </S>",
    "<S> as we assume that the higgs boson is light , i.e. , lighter than twice the mass of the @xmath4 bosons , the function @xmath29 reads @xmath30 for the decay into two gluons one finds @xcite @xmath31 also neglecting the radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath24 was given in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility for the higgs boson to decay are the electroweak boson channels @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson couples to the electroweak bosons with the same strength as in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the decay via two virtual electroweak bosons represents a non - negligible contribution to the higgs decay . for @xmath34 or @xmath35 one of the electroweak bosons </S>",
    "<S> is on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> these decay rates were evaluated using the program hdecay @xcite and cross - checked using comphep @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are the sum of the decay over two electroweak bosons , for a light higgs both electroweak bosons are virtual , when allowed by the kinematics , the contributions of on - shell electroweak bosons are also taken into account .    </S>",
