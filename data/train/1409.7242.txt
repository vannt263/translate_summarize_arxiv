    "the study of the spectrum of the nucleon resonances and the resonances coupling constants from the available experimental data are two of the most important issues in hadronic physics and they are attracting much attention  @xcite . in the classical quark models  @xcite , a rich spectrum of excited nucleon states is predicted .",
    "many of these nucleon resonances could be identified in @xmath11 scattering . however , there are still some of them have not been so far observed .",
    "the strangeness production reaction @xmath0 is a good platform to study the properties of the nucleon resonances , especially for those which have significant couplings to @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels , because the @xmath13 reaction is a pure isospin @xmath14 two - body reaction channel in meson - nucleon dynamics , and there are no contributions from the isospin @xmath15 @xmath16 baryons .",
    "hence , lots of experimental data have been accumulated  @xcite , where the total and differential cross sections of @xmath17 reaction are measured .    in response to this wealth of data , the theoretical activity has run in parallel . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - body reaction @xmath0 is investigated using the partial wave amplitudes which are constructed from the available experimental data .",
    "the total and differential cross sections of @xmath18 reaction can be well described by using these amplitudes , which are essential for obtaining spin - flip and spin non - flip amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "but , from these amplitudes , it is difficult to get clear properties of some nucleon resonances , because the partial wave amplitudes could have contributions from nucleon resonances with different spins , and individual contributions are more difficult to pin down .",
    "this deficiency is also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite where the reactions @xmath19 are studied simultaneously within an analytic , unitary , coupled - channel approach .",
    "moreover , it is pointed out that there are ambiguities of the @xmath13 scattering amplitudes obtained from the partial wave analysis , when only the observables of the differential cross section and polarization are measured  @xcite .    the role played by the nucleon resonance @xmath7 , which has proved to be",
    "a controversial resonance for many years , in the @xmath20 production is crucial .",
    "the @xmath7 couples strongly to the @xmath21 channel  @xcite but a large @xmath22 coupling has also been deduced  @xcite through the analysis of bes data on @xmath23 decay  @xcite and cosy data on the @xmath24 reaction near threshold  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the analyses of recent saphir  @xcite and clas  @xcite @xmath25 data also indicate a large coupling of the @xmath7 resonance to the @xmath20 channel .",
    "furthermore , in a chiral unitary coupled channel model it is found that the @xmath7 resonance is dynamically generated , with its mass , width and branching ratios in fair agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "this approach shows that the couplings of the @xmath7 resonance to @xmath26 channel could be large compared to those for @xmath11 .",
    "we wish to argue in this work that the @xmath7 resonance might play a much wide role in associated strangeness production of @xmath27 reaction .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the two - body reaction @xmath17 within an effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model , which is an important theoretical method for describing various processes in the resonances production region  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the background contributions from @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange , @xmath3-channel @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchange , and @xmath6-channel nucleon pole terms , we also investigate the contributions from nucleon resonances @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which have significant couplings to @xmath11 and @xmath20 channels  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we present the formalism and ingredients required for the calculation .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in sect .",
    "a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "in this section , we introduce the theoretical formalism and ingredients for calculating the @xmath28 reaction by using the effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model . in the following equations , we use @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , which denote the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .    the basic tree level feynman diagrams for the @xmath17 reaction are depicted in fig .  [ fig : feydg ] .",
    "these include @xmath6-channel nucleon pole and nucleon resonances process [ fig .",
    "[ fig : feydg ] ( a ) ] , @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange [ fig .",

    "[ fig : feydg ] , the effective lagrangian densities for relevant interaction vertexes are needed . following refs .",
    "@xcite , the lagrangian densities used in present work are ,    @xmath33    for @xmath6-channel nucleon pole and nucleon resonances , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 exchange terms , and @xmath34 for the @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange process , while @xmath35 for the @xmath3-channel @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchange diagrams .    for the coupling constants in the above lagrangian densities for @xmath1-channel and @xmath3-channel processes , we take @xmath36 ( obtained by @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 ( obtained by @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 ( obtained by @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42   to @xmath11 . ] , which are used in ref .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the differential distributions @xmath46 calculated with the fit i best - fit parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcs ] as a function of @xmath47 and for various @xmath48 invariant mass intervals .",
    "the contributions from different mechanisms are shown separately .",
    "thus , we split the full result into four main contributions : effective lagrangian approach background , @xmath6-channel @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first one corresponds to the @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange , @xmath6-channel nucleon pole , and @xmath3-channel @xmath4 hyperon pole and @xmath5 terms .",
    "we find an overall good description of the data for the whole range of measured @xmath48 invariant masses below @xmath49 gev , and the contributions from the above three main mechanisms are all significant to reproduce the current experimental data .",
    "our best result of the total cross sections of @xmath17 reaction as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath50 system are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcs ] compared with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "there , we see that we can describe the total cross section data quite well . as mentioned above , the @xmath7 resonance and @xmath8 resonance couple strongly to the @xmath26 channel .",
    "indeed , the total cross section of @xmath13 show a strong @xmath51-wave contributions close to the reaction threshold and also a little bit beyond . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tcs ] , it is seen that the contribution from @xmath8 ( blue dashed curve ) is predominant at a very wide energy region , and the contribution from the @xmath7 ( red solid curve ) is significant from the reaction threshold till @xmath52 gev , while the contributions from @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange and @xmath6-channel @xmath9 are dominant above @xmath53 gev .",
    "the @xmath6-channel nucleon pole and @xmath3-channel contributions are too small to be shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcs ] and can be neglected .",

    "the bold black solid lines represent the results from the full model , while the contributions from @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange and @xmath6-channel @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 terms are shown by the magenta dash - dot - doted , red solid , green dashed and blue doted curves , respectively . ]    it is worthy to note that we do not consider the contribution from the nucleon resonance @xmath54 , which is mostly required by the @xmath11 inelastic scattering data .",
    "the role of this resonance in the context of different partial - wave analyses has been discussed extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the analysis of the @xmath55 reaction ,",
    "a @xmath54 resonance is needed  @xcite .",
    "but , it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the analysis of the @xmath56 reaction , there is an interplay between the @xmath9 and @xmath54 and individual contributions are difficult to pin down .",
    "moreover , the @xmath54 resonance appears in the three - body hadronic calculations  @xcite and also could be a dynamically generated resonance  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a bayesian analysis of the world data on @xmath25 reaction  @xcite show that there is no significant contribution of the @xmath54 resonance to the @xmath57 reaction .",
    "because of those doubts of this resonance , we ignore its contribution in our present calculations .",
    "in this paper , the @xmath28 reaction is investigated within an effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model .",
    "this channel is known to receive significant nonresonant contributions which complicates the extraction of @xmath58 information .",
    "in addition to the background contributions from the @xmath6-channel nucleon pole , @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange , @xmath3-channel @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchanges , we also consider the contributions from @xmath6-channel nucleon resonances @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . from @xmath59fits to the available experimental data for the @xmath13 reaction , we get the appropriate parameters which describe the total and differential cross sections well .",
    "our results show that the inclusion of the nucleon resonances @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 can lead to a good description of the low energy experimental total and differential cross sections data of @xmath13 reaction .",
    "the contribution from each individual resonance to the total and differential cross sections below @xmath60 gev are also presented .",
    "the contributions from those nucleon resonances and the @xmath1-channel @xmath2 exchange are dominant , while @xmath6-channel nucleon pole and the @xmath3-channel @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchange give the minor contributions and can be neglected .",
