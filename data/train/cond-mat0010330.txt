    "compared to straight leads ( which have most commonly been used in publications on waveguides ) , conical leads are more similar to the electron sea which provides the source of electrons in most experiments . as shown in ref .  , conical leads allow tunneling resonances through the waveguide cavity for energy regimes in which conduction",

    "it is usual to express the properties of the system in terms of an s - matrix , which contains reflection and transmission amplitudes from incoming channels to outgoing channels in the leads .",

    "the matter wave @xmath12 inside the leads is expanded in terms of the incoming and outgoing modes , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "then the expansion coefficients describe the probability amplitudes of reflection or transmission of the matter wave from an incoming channel to the outgoing channels .",

    "( [ eq : schrod ] ) is not unique , but we obtain different solutions @xmath70 depending on which channel @xmath61 is assumed to carry the incoming part of the matter wave .",
    "the s - matrix connects the amplitudes of the incoming propagating electrons to the amplitudes of the outgoing propagating electrons and it is therefore constructed out of all the reflection and transmission amplitudes .",

    "the reflection and transmission amplitudes must be computed numerically ( see appendix ) .",
    "one aspect of the scattering properties of the waveguide that we wish to explore is how close a correspondence there is between the fano scattering resonances and the eigenstates of a closed version of the waveguide cavity . in this section ,",
    "we therefore describe some features of these eigenstates as the cut size on the cut - circle billiard is changed .",
    "the schrdinger equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : schrod ] ) ] for a quantum particle in a closed full - circle billiard is separable , with one part describing the radial and the other part the azimuthal motion . the ( discrete ) energy spectrum can be labeled with two good quantum numbers",
    ". one of them , @xmath80 , is associated with radial motion , and the other , @xmath81 , with the angular motion .",

    "the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath87 are then calculated via @xmath88 .",
    "the energy eigenstates of the circle billiard with angular momentum @xmath89 , corresponding to clockwise or counter clockwise rotation of the matter wave , produce two - fold degenerate eigenenergies . only the eigenenergies with @xmath90 are non - degenerate .    if we apply a cut to the closed system , the classical dynamics of the particle exhibits hard chaos @xcite , as long as @xmath91 .",
    "looking at the quantum properties , we observe a splitting of the degenerate eigenenergies as the cut is inserted .",
    "the absence of degenerate eigenvalues ( level repulsion ) is a well - known quantum feature of classically chaotic systems ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .    examining the quantum properties of the cut - circle billiard in more detail ,",
    "we show how five of the energy levels of the cut billiard behave as the cut size is varied from @xmath92 to @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bileigval ] .",
    "the states shown are continuations of the circle cavity degenerate pairs @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and one of the pair , @xmath96 .    here and in later numerical computations",
    ", we are using dimensionless variables . the dimensionless energy @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a dimensionless wavevector .",
    "to get an idea of how this translates to the physical dimensions of our system , consider an electron density of @xmath100 , which is a typical value measured for a two dimensional electron gas in a gaas / al@xmath101ga@xmath102as heterostructure @xcite .",
    "the corresponding fermi wavevector is @xmath103 , the fermi energy @xmath104 ( for an effective electron mass in gaas of @xmath105 ) .",
    "this yields for @xmath106 , which is the maximum energy we used in the computations , @xmath107 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bileigval ] , we observe a ( distant ) avoided crossing , which occurs between states 2b and 3a in the interval @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "we also see an actual crossing in this plot .",
    "this occurs between the states labeled 2a and 2b at about @xmath110 .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .  , separate eigenvalues of a generic hamiltonian can in general only be brought to coincide if at least three parameters are varied .",
    "thus , at first sight , we would expect another level repulsion instead of the actual crossing , since we only vary @xmath1 .",
    "yet we ignored that the hamiltonian of the cut - circle is not completely `` generic '' . even if the cut is inserted , the system retains parity symmetry with respect to an axis perpendicular to the cut , i.e. , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the parity operator for a symmetry axis through the center of the cavity , at angle @xmath4 ( i.e. , the angle at which the center of the cut is placed ) . because of parity symmetry , we have two different symmetry classes , namely the classes formed by even and odd states . since parity is a discrete symmetry , states of one class can not interact with states of the other , thus both classes are completely independent of each other .",
    "therefore , crossings between states of different parity may occur . only _ within _ each parity class , i.e. , among states with the same parity , crossings remain impossible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bileigstate ] , we show energy eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues 2a , 2b , and 3a in fig .",
    "[ fig : bileigval ] , for three different cut sizes taken before the avoided crossing , between the avoided and actual crossings , and after the actual crossing .",
    "it can be seen that 2a has even parity , and 2b and 3a both have odd parities .",
    "this explains why 2a and 2b can undergo the crossing , whereas a crossing between 2b and 3a is avoided .",
    "we also see that the state 2a , which does not participate in the avoided crossing and undergoes the crossing with 2b , remains unchanged .",
    "however , states 2b and 3a , which do undergo an avoided crossing , become mixed and loose their original identities . the mutual parity of states 2b and 3a allows them to couple , whereas this is impossible for states 2a and 2b with differing parities .",
    "if we attach leads to the circle billiard , we have a matter waveguide and the eigenstates of the billiard become unstable and may decay .",
    "these unstable states strongly affect the scattering dynamics of the waveguide .",
    "they appear as resonances in the transmission probabilities through the waveguide , @xmath113 for incoming mode @xmath61 in lead  1 , where @xmath51 runs over the outgoing modes in lead  2 .",
    "we can examine the individual @xmath114 s or consider their sum over all possible incoming modes in lead  1 , which is proportional to the landauer - bttiker conductance @xcite , @xmath115 as shown in ref .  , there is an energy range where , for conical leads , mode @xmath61 has nonzero transmission , whereas for straight leads with the same opening angles it would still be evanescent .",
    "this occurs for energies too small for the @xmath61th transverse standing wave to fit into the lead opening at the junction to the cavity , such that the wave has to `` tunnel '' into the cavity .",
    "the condition for this tunneling ( see ref .  ) is @xmath116 , if @xmath117 is the width of the lead opening ( for opening angle @xmath118 ) .",
    "thus , tunneling occurs for energies such that @xmath119 where @xmath97 is the dimensionless energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ dim - en ] ) .",
    "in addition to the transmission probabilities and landauer - bttiker conductance , it is useful to look at the wigner delay times , @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the phases of the s - matrix eigenvalues @xmath122 .",
    "the wigner delay times are a measure of the time delay of the electron due to the presence of the cavity . in the following plots",
    ", we will use dimensionless delay times @xmath123 ( for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , the wigner delay time is of the order of 0.1 ns . ) from ref .",
    "it is clear that peaks in the wigner delay time correspond to resonances and poles of the scattering matrix in the complex energy plane .",
    "therefore we can use peaks in the delay time spectra to indicate the resonances of our system .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : wgcirc ] , we show numerical data obtained for an electron waveguide with a circle cavity with symmetrically placed leads , one at @xmath127 and the other at @xmath128 .",
    "both leads subtend the same angle @xmath129 .",
    "the dimensionless energy @xmath97 is varied in steps of 0.5 .    the transmission probability in fig .  [ fig : wgcirc](a ) shows the quantities @xmath114 for incoming modes @xmath130 in lead  1 .",
    "the first mode ( @xmath131 ) starts transmitting ( i.e. , becomes significantly larger than zero ) at about @xmath132 .",
    "the second mode starts transmitting too closely below 100 to be visible in the plot .",
    "the transmission for higher modes is zero everywhere in the energy interval below 100 , and therefore these modes were not included in the computations or the plot .",
    "the threshold energies @xmath133 , for which the modes would start propagating in the case of straight leads with @xmath134 , are @xmath135 , and @xmath136 for the first two channels .",
    "this means that for the conical leads , we observe tunneling of the first mode in the energy range between @xmath132 and 40 .    examining the correspondence between eigenenergies of the closed circle ( indicated by filled circles for degenerate levels and open circles for non - degenerate levels ) and resonances of the open system , one finds that there is obviously a strong association . in energy intervals without eigenenergies ,",
    "the transmission changes smoothly , whereas there are sharp changes close to eigenenergies . in the tunneling regime",
    ", we see peaks close to the eigenenergies .",
    "the peaks tend to be slightly shifted to the left . above the tunneling threshold",
    ", we also observe valleys , e.g. , at @xmath137 . in this regime",
    ", most peaks and valleys in the vicinity of an eigenenergy are too close together to tell which is associated with the eigenenergy .",
    "since the lead openings themselves alter the geometry of the system , we can not expect the resonances to be found exactly at the same positions as the eigenenergies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wgcirc](b ) , we plot the dimensionless delay times @xmath138 .",
    "the energy derivatives at each point are approximated by carrying out two computations for each point , with energy spacing @xmath139 .",
    "since the transmission probabilities @xmath114 vanish for @xmath140 , we only have to consider the two channels @xmath131 and @xmath141 .",
    "thus , the s - matrix is a 4x4 matrix and we get four eigenphases and four delay time curves .    here , unlike for the transmission probabilities , we only need to look for _ peaks _ in the wigner delay times at the resonance energies , in the tunneling as well as in the normal regime .",
    "the first two time delays display their first peak around @xmath142 , the others at @xmath143 . at these energies ,",
    "the corresponding transmission probabilities are still too close to zero to produce a visible peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : wgcirc](a ) .",
    "this shows that the delay times are a more sensitive indicator of resonances than the @xmath114 s .",
    "we see that the degenerate eigenenergies of the circle billiard do not produce double resonances when leads are attached at the special angles @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "every eigenenergy of the circle billiard is associated only with a _",
    "delay time peak .",
    "although placing leads to the circle cavity destroys its radial symmetry , the breaking of the degeneracy is not observed in this case .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : wgasymcir ] , we show the same waveguide , but with asymmetric placement of leads instead of the symmetric placement we had in fig .",
    "[ fig : wgcirc ] .",
    "lead  1 is placed at @xmath127 and lead  2 at @xmath144 .",
    "now we not only see again the close correspondence between delay time peaks and eigenenergies of the circle , but we also observe double peaks at most of the degenerate billiard eigenenergies , most evidently at @xmath14524.6 , 28.8 , 35.4 , 38.5 , and 49.4 . at higher energies ,",
    "the observation of double peaks is more difficult because the second mode starts transmitting .",
    "( some of its first peaks are too small to be seen in the plot , but can be found by looking at the data file . )",
    "many of the double peaks show a small energy spacing : one peak is slightly shifted to smaller energies , the other one to higher energies . here , the degeneracy is obviously broken by the addition of the leads . for the non - degenerate eigenenergies on the other hand , no splitting can be observed . especially at @xmath146 ,",
    "this becomes very obvious .",
    "the difference between this case and the previous case with symmetric lead placement ( @xmath128 ) is that , for symmetric placement , we had two discrete symmetries , namely invariance under the parity transformations @xmath147 and @xmath148 [ where the parity operators are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parity ] ) ] .",
    "when the leads are placed asymmetrically , the symmetry under @xmath147 , with respect to the axis bisecting both leads , is destroyed , and we are only left with one parity symmetry under @xmath149 .",
    "the breaking of one parity symmetry seems to be the reason for the splitting of resonances seen in fig .",

    "if we assume that the total wavefunction of our system varies rather smoothly on a length scale of @xmath154 , it seems plausible that a `` small '' number of parameters , say about 10 , should be sufficient to approximate @xmath12 on an interval of length @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , we expect that such a `` small '' multiple of @xmath155=``the number of @xmath154-intervals needed to cover the cavity boundary '' should give a reasonable order of magnitude estimate for @xmath156 .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : wgsymcut16 ] , but for asymmetric placement of leads . now we place the leads at @xmath127 and @xmath163 and the cut at @xmath164 .",
    "the crossing of resonances 2a and 2b , which occurred for the symmetric leads and for the closed cut - circle billiard , has now become an avoided crossing .",
    "( in fact we now have a sequence of two closely spaced avoided crossings , similar to the case studied in ref .  . ) here , the parity symmetry of the closed system is destroyed by placing the leads asymmetrically .",
    "therefore , in the asymmetric open system , we no longer have two separate classes of states ( namely states of even and odd parity ) and the crossing , which was possible in the closed system and in the symmetric open system , is avoided here .",
    "we now look at the distribution of electron probability in the cavity at the resonance energies .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resstates ] for the asymmetric system .",
    "a three - way avoided crossing has mixed the resonance states , and has destroyed the identity they had for smaller cut size .",
    "the upper row displays the four states before the avoided crossing , which still reflect the quantum numbers of the associated circle states very well . for the middle row ,",
    "the character of states 2a , 2b , and 3a has been changed .",
    "only the resonance state 1b , which never comes really close to the crossing region , has preserved its characteristic structure ( two rings with six peaks each ) quite well . in the bottom row , after the second avoided crossing , 2a and 2b have mixed even further .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a waveguide with a cut - circle cavity by calculating conductances and wigner delay times .",
    "we attached conic leads to the cavity in two ways , symmetrically and asymmetrically .",
    "we observed two kinds of avoided crossings when the leads were placed asymmetrically , breaking the parity symmetry of the closed cavity .",
    "one avoided crossing was due to the chaos of the closed cavity , i.e. , due to level repulsions between states in the same symmetry class , which are known to occur for fully chaotic systems .",
    "the other avoided crossing was due to the breaking of the discrete symmetry ( the parity in our case ) by placing leads asymmetrically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wgasymcut16 ] ) .",
    "there is now great interest in exploring the effects of underlying chaos on the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "however , open quantum systems must make contact with the outside world .",
    "this contact itself may induce some of the signatures of chaos .",
    "this fact has also been studied extensively by jung and seligman @xcite for classical scattering systems . the avoided crossing between 2a and 2b , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : wgasymcut16 ] , provides another example of this effect .",
    "in order to obtain an explicit expression for the s - matrix , we need to find the stationary solutions @xmath12 of eq .",

    "this can only be done numerically for our system . for that purpose",
    ", we use the boundary integral method described in ref .  .",
    "below , we will give an outline of this method adapted to our particular problem .",
    "the boundary integral method is based on the use of green s theorem , which , for two functions @xmath173 and @xmath174 , states that @xmath175 if @xmath176 is a closed contour confining an area @xmath177 , @xmath178 is the longitudinal coordinate along @xmath176 , and @xmath86 is the normal coordinate . for the boundary integral method , we choose for the functions @xmath173 and @xmath174 the wavefunction @xmath12 and a weight function @xmath179 that satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath180 then , since @xmath12 is a solution of the schrdinger equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : schrod ] ) ] , i.e. , @xmath12 also satisfies @xmath181 , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ = greenth0 ] ) is identically zero .",
    "therefore we get @xmath182 as the basic equation of this numerical approach .",
    "( note that the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath179 is that there are no boundary conditions for @xmath179 , whereas @xmath12 has to satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by the geometry of the waveguide . )    for our problem , we choose @xmath176 to follow the walls of the cavity . for the places where the leads come in , @xmath176 is taken to be the continuation of the circular wall segments in order to construct a closed contour .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ = greenth1 ] ) allows us to obtain the s - matrix and the probability distribution inside the cavity for any incoming particle energy .",
    "this is done by inserting ( approximate ) expansions of @xmath12 with , say , @xmath183 yet unknown expansion coefficients .",
    "as we need @xmath183 equations to solve for these expansion coefficients , we apply eq .",
    "( [ = greenth1 ] ) with sufficiently many different weight functions @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) .    in principle",
    ", there are several choices possible for the @xmath184 s , as long as they satisfy eq .",
    "( [ = helmholtz_phi ] ) .",
    "for numerical convenience , we used the same functions as for the expansion of @xmath12 inside the cavity , namely @xmath186 with the @xmath18 s given by eq .",

    "[ cavstates ] , @xmath17 , which allows us to determine @xmath189 expansion coefficients .",

    "( for an electron incident in lead  2 , the expressions look similar . )    along the walls of the cavity , the electron wavefunction is zero , but it may have a finite slope perpendicular to the wall",
    ". we can expand this slope in terms of a complete orthonormal basis along the wall .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath198 with some set of basis functions @xmath199 in variable @xmath178 .",
    "the index @xmath200 is used to denote the cut , and @xmath201 denote the three different circular wall segments .",

    ", we could use the fourier basis , too .",
    "however , as this results in very long computation times , a basis of small triangles proved to be more efficient .",
    "thus , along the straight wall we use @xmath207 for @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the length of the cut , @xmath1 is its opening angle , and @xmath210 .",

    "note that in order to include both leads ( @xmath222 ) in @xmath218 and @xmath219 , the first columns of these matrices correspond to lead  1 , and the columns for lead  2 are simply appended .",
    "( similarly , @xmath220 is composed of the different wall parts , @xmath223 , also columnwise . )",
    "the quantity @xmath224 is a column matrix containing the unknown transmission and reflection coefficients for a particle incident in channel @xmath61 in lead 1 , as well as the coefficients @xmath225 , which describe the normal derivative of @xmath70 on the walls .",
    "as this is the quantity which we want to solve for , we need to invert the matrix @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , this matrix has to be square .",
    "this can be achieved by using appropriate cutoff numbers @xmath227 ( @xmath222 ) in the lead expansions [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : leadexp1 ] ) ] and @xmath228 ( @xmath223 ) in the wall expansions [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : wallexp ] ) ] .",
    "since the matrix consists of @xmath229 rows , these numbers have to satisfy the relation @xmath230 ( note that @xmath231 , therefore we actually sum over @xmath232 terms for the wall parts . ) for best numerical accuracy , the relations of the cutoff numbers are chosen approximately equal to the length relations of the corresponding integration paths .",
    "once the elements of the s - matrix have been obtained by the method described above , it is an easy task to calculate the probability amplitude for the electron state inside the cavity .",
    "we know that the wavefunction , which , inside the cavity , is described by eq .",
