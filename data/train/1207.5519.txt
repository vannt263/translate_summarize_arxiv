    "the advent of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and other new ( sub-)millimetre telescopes , with their unprecendented spatial resolution and sensitivity , will allow the observation of giant stars in other galaxies in similar detail to that achieved for galactic objects .",
    "these advanced capabilities prompt investigation into the nature of these extragalactic stars , with one of the most interesting aspects being the study of the effect of sub - solar metallicities on circumstellar chemistry and dust composition .",
    "recent studies in the infrared using the spitzer space telescope and ground - based instruments have highlighted the deep molecular absorptions of , primarily , acetylene in the spectra of evolved carbon stars , in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these absorption features are in general deeper than those seen in galactic stars , and this implies that there is a difference between the chemistry of magellanic circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) and galactic carbon stars , which are comparatively well - studied .",
    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are nearby dwarf galaxies with sub - solar metallicities .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , at a distance of @xmath050kpc @xcite , has an average metallicity of around 50% solar @xcite .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , at a slightly larger distance of 66kpc @xcite , has an average metallicity of 20% solar @xcite .",
    "the effect of this low metallicity regime on dust composition and galactic dust budgets has been studied observationally by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the effects on circumstellar chemistry have not been , as yet , studied in any detail , and our aim here is to pioneer in the field with this work .",
    "the chemical modelling of galactic agb stars was first attempted 35 years ago .",
    "initial attempts focused on simple physical models and chemistry appropriate for oxygen - rich ( @xmath1 ) ) circumstellar environments @xcite .",
    "physical models have largely remained simple ( with some notable exceptions , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the chemical modelling has moved to focus on carbon - rich ( @xmath2 ) ) circumstellar chemistry since it shows a wider variety of molecules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "progress in chemical modelling is driven in part by the desire to explain observed abundances of newly - detected molecules in the most accessible carbon star , irc+10216 , for instance , in the addition of long carbon - chain molecules @xcite or anion species @xcite . in this case , advances in technology have driven us to investigate carbon - rich circumstellar chemistry in previously challenging locations .    in this paper , we present the results of modelling the circumstellar chemistry around carbon - rich agb stars at sub - solar metallicities .",
    "we focus on three fiducial models , at metallicities and with physical conditions appropriate for the galaxy , the lmc and the smc .",
    "we initially assume solar metallicity ( @xmath3=0.02 ) for galactic carbon stars , and average interstellar metallicities for lmc ( @xmath3=0.008 ) and smc ( @xmath3=0.004 ) carbon stars . in  2 we describe our adopted physical model and discuss the different physical and chemical considerations , and also discuss sources of uncertainties in our models in  2.6 . in ",
    "3 we describe how we calculate the chemical evolution of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "we show our results in  4 , preceding a discussion in  5 ( including our calculations of molecular line emission which may be observable with alma ) and finally , in  6 , we draw our conclusions regarding the chemistry of low - metallicity carbon stars .",
    "nucleosynthetic products dredged ( via convection ) from the stellar interior are mixed to the surface of the star , where material is accelerated to the terminal velocity of the stellar wind within a radius of 20r@xmath4  @xcite and passed into the cse .",
    "the gas , which is mainly molecular hydrogen , is well - mixed with dust grains .",
    "we assume a spherical geometry where the gas has a 1/@xmath5density distribution , and a temperature profile which follows @xmath6\\mathrm{\\,k.}\\quad(r \\geq \\mathrm{r_0 } =    5\\times10^{15}\\:\\mathrm{cm})\\ ] ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cse is irradiated by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , but not by uv photons from the star itself , which are quenched in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "extinction in the cse is calculated according to the approach of @xcite , assuming interstellar - type grains , and we treat co self - shielding according to @xcite .",
    "we model the carbon - rich chemistry in the circumstellar region between @xmath0200100000r@xmath4  ( 0.0053@xmath710@xmath8 cm ) .    in the subsequent sections , we consider the chemical and further physical ingredients of our model .",
    "observationally , very little is known about the chemistry of extragalactic carbon stars , and so we mainly discuss the chemistry of galactic carbon stars , using the nucleosynthesis models of @xcite to adjust for lower metallicities ( see  [ sec : initabunds ] ) .",
    "physical parameters of lmc and smc carbon stars are more well constrained observationally , and we summarise those aspects in  [ sec : mlr][sec : isrf ] .      [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in our integration time estimates , we assume an array size of 50 antennae and a spectral resolution of 2.0km / s .",
    "in addition to our simple estimates for the expected line flux density described above , we have used the one - dimensional non - lte monte carlo radiative transfer code , ratran @xcite , to estimate the line profiles and line strengths of molecular line emission from evolved carbon stars in the lmc and smc . in our simple estimates ( see eqs .  [",
    "eq : lmcmols ] and [ eq : smcmols ] ) , we assume lte and an excitation temperature of 10k for all rotational transitions . in reality , the envelopes of agb stars have a radially - dependent temperature and density structure ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) which limits the accuracy of calculations made with these assumptions .",
    "the temperature varies from @xmath01000k in the inner envelope to @xmath010k in the outer envelope .",
    "similarly , the density structure exhibits a @xmath9  behaviour so that in the outer envelope the density is much lower than the critical density of rotational transitions ( @xmath10/@xmath11 , where @xmath12  indicates all energy levels lower than the upper level , @xmath13 ) .",
    "we used molecular data from the leiden atomic and molecular database ( lamda ) which has tabulated energy levels , einstein a coefficients and collisional rates for many molecules with transitions in the ( sub-)mm region of the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .    in our radiative transfer calculations , as in the physical and chemical modelling , we treat the stellar envelope as spherically symmetric with a constant outward stellar wind velocity of 10kms@xmath14  for the lmc and 5kms@xmath14  for the smc .",
    "since our line profiles are broadened to a width @xmath1520kms@xmath14and @xmath1510kms@xmath14 , respectively , we use a spectral resolution of 1kms@xmath14  for both sources .",
    "we assume a distance to source of 50kpc for the lmc and 66kpc for the smc .",
    "we generated line profiles and line strengths for rotational transitions of co , cs , cn , hcn , sio and sis which fall into the expected spectral range of alma full scienceoperations ( @xmath1630ghz to @xmath16950ghz ) .",
    "these are the molecules which our calculations suggested may be sufficiently abundant to possess emission strong enough to be observable and for which collisional rates are available . using the alma sensitivity calculator , we determined those line transitions which may be observable with alma full science within a realistic observing time .",
    "our results are listed in table  [ tab : alma_obs ] .",
    "we determine that molecular transitions in bands 6 and 7 make particularly good targets . assuming a spectral resolution of 2kms@xmath14  and an array size of 50 antennae",
    ", we find the observation times for lmc and smc molecular transitions range from a few minutes for the co @xmath17=21 and @xmath17=32 transitions at 230 and 345ghz to several hours for transitions of hcn , cs , sio , sis and cn which also fall into bands 6 and 7 .",
    "in addition , the co @xmath17=10 transition , in band 3 , may also be observable to high signal - to - noise within one hour in evolved stars within both galaxies .",
    "we note here that our time calculations are likely upper estimates since the alma full array may eventually consist of up to 66 antennae in total . also , the online alma sensitivity calculator overestimates the predicted observing times relative to the more accurate calculator available using the alma observing tool , again , indicating that our predicted times are likely upper estimates . in figs .",
    "[ fig : lmc_6][fig : smc_6 ] we present the expected line spectra due to emission from the listed molecules from a carbon star in both the lmc and smc , for alma bands 6 and 7",
    ". line profiles of each line transition are also provided in online - only material ( figs .",
    "reducing the mass - loss rate of the models by a factor of three reduces the line strengths in table  [ tab : alma_obs ] by a similar factor . thus probing the molecular inventory of carbon stars with low mass - loss rates in the mcs will be challenging .    looking firstly at the predicted line spectra for the lmc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc_6 ] ) , we see that the strongest transitions are due to co , cn , hcn and sio .",
    "multiple transitions of cn , sio , cs and sis are available within a single band which would allow determination of the temperature and density of the emitting gas , enabling some constraints on the physical conditions in the envelope . for the smc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smc_6 ] ) , we see a similar pattern , however , we now find that transitions of sis are comparable in strength with those of sio and hcn . comparing the two metallicity regimes , we see differences in the line strength ratios between co / cn and sio / sis , with these ratios generally decreasing with metallicity .",
    "this follows , given the decreased amount of oxygen available in the smc relative to the lmc .",
    "we also see the line strength ratios of cn / hcn slightly increase with metallicity , likely related to the increased strength of the isrf in the smc .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that there are observable tracers of metallicity and physical conditions in extragalactic carbon stars which alma will allow us to probe .",
    "this investigation was prompted by the observation of very common and very deep molecular absorptions due to c@xmath18h@xmath18  in the mid - infrared spectra ( 538@xmath19 m ) of lmc carbon stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a number of examples ) compared to galactic carbon stars .",
    "this occurs particularly in the extreme carbon stars , which are losing mass at very high rates . of course",
    ", the fact that these deep features exist has been established for several years : @xcite analysed the deepest c@xmath18h@xmath18  absorption feature observed to date ; @xcite noted that acetylene bands were stronger at low metallicity ; @xcite measured equivalent widths of molecular lines ; @xcite and @xcite detected acetylene absorptions in smc carbon stars that appeared deeper than in corresponding galactic and lmc carbon stars .",
    "there have also been studies in the acetylene - dominated 3.1/3.8@xmath19 m bands which show similar results : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a 3@xmath19 m band study , finding that acetylene absorption features in lmc and smc carbon stars were equivalent in depth .",
    "the origin of the 3@xmath19 m acetylene band is a mixture of photospheric and circumstellar origin @xcite , whereas the 13.7@xmath19 m absorption seen in spitzer spectra is predominantly circumstellar @xcite .",
    "we have shown via thermal equilibrium calculations that photospheric  acetylene increases in abundance as the metallicity is lowered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : te ] ) , qualitatively matching what we observe at 3@xmath19 m .",
    "we have also shown via radially - dependent non - equilibrium calculations that indeed acetylene is more abundant in carbon - rich circumstellar envelopes at lower metallicity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : full - stabpar ] ) .",
    "initial investigations into carbon stars in other low(er)-metallicity galaxies show that acetylene features are also very strong ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) unfortunately we do not yet have sufficiently good quality infrared data to perform quantitative analyses .",
    "related to the study of acetylene is the study of hydrogen cyanide .",
    "it absorbs in the 3.1@xmath19 m band with acetylene , and also forms part of the 13.7@xmath19 m band , absorbing at @xmath014@xmath19 m . there is also a band at 7@xmath19 m , close to the acetylene band at 7.5@xmath19 m .",
    "its contribution to these bands has been detected in a number of magellanic carbon stars , but not nearly so prevalently as acetylene ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some objects",
    "the absorptions are strong @xcite , whereas in other objects , absorptions are very weak @xcite . both the thermal equilibrium model and the circumstellar envelope model predict high abundances of hcn at low metallicity , despite the lower abundance of elemental nitrogen .",
    "this would imply that both the 3@xmath19 m and 13.7@xmath19 m bands should show ample evidence of hcn absorption .",
    "our high abundances may be an effect of our choice of 3m@xmath20  nucleosynthesis models ( sect .",
    "[ sec : initabunds ] ) since the nitrogen abundance in agb stars is dependent on ( initial ) stellar mass , such that stars with high luminosity ( i.e. , high initial mass ) should have abundant hcn @xcite .",
    "the variation in feature strength seen in the infrared may reflect varying initial stellar mass in the observed samples .",
    "the impact of different choices of stellar mass should be looked into in future models .",
    "scaling initial abundances up or down uniformly generally results in a similar scaling of cse abundances ; however , changes in stellar mass are unlikely to produce such a uniform scaling , but would result in abundance enhancements in some elements over others .",
    "emission from two large circumstellar molecules was observed recently in magellanic objects .",
    "the fullerenes c@xmath21  and c@xmath22  have been detected in a decade of planetary nebulae ( pne ; @xcite ; @xcite provides a summary of all fullerene detections ) in the lmc , as well as several galactic objects , including ( proto-)planetary nebulae and reflection nebulae .",
    "the magellanic clouds are presumably rich in fullerenes , whether they form from smaller hydrocarbons coagulating or the destruction of hydrogenated amorphous carbon dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in galactic nebulae fullerenes",
    "potentially take up one percent of the elemental carbon abundance @xcite ; as table  [ tab : coratios ] shows , there is significantly more carbon available for fullerene formation in magellanic objects . on average ,",
    "@xcite s sample of magellanic carbon - rich pne contains 60%  more c@xmath21  than the galactic pn , tc-1 . as a representative of large molecules ,",
    "c@xmath23h@xmath18  is two orders of magnitude more abundant in magellanic carbon stars than in galactic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : full - polyyne ] ) in our models . as a representative of cyclic molecules ,",
    "benzene is @xmath0200 times more abundant in magellanic carbon star envelopes than galactic ; its column density is @xmath24(c@xmath25h@xmath25)@xmath010@xmath26(c@xmath18h@xmath18 ) .",
    "these four molecules currently make up the extent of our knowledge of gas - phase species in the envelopes of carbon stars in the magellanic clouds . given the derived line intensities and simulated spectra from table  [ tab : lineintens ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : lmc_6][fig : smc_6 ] , alma will be able to detect a handful of molecules in a reasonable amount of time : detections of co rotational lines will enable us to derive mass - loss rates and envelope expansion velocities ; detections of other molecules will enable us to verify our chemical models , and to improve our understanding of circumstellar carbon chemistry at low metallicity .",
    "driven by the recent interest in deep molecular absorption features in spitzer space telescope spectra of evolved carbon stars in the magellanic clouds , we have conducted the first investigation into the circumstellar chemistry of carbon stars in three metallicity environments : that of the galaxy ( solar metallicity ) , the lmc ( half solar metallicity ) and the smc ( one fifth solar metallicity ) .",
    "the general trend is that the abundances of hydrocarbons are greatly enhanced at low metallicity , so much so that the larger members of hydrocarbon families are more abundant than smaller members ( e.g. , c@xmath25h@xmath18  and c@xmath27h@xmath18  are more abundant than c@xmath28h@xmath18 ) . at just half of solar metallicity , acetylene becomes more abundant in the circumstellar envelope than carbon monoxide , the most abundant molecule apart from h@xmath18  in galactic cses .",
    "this is indicative of a suppressed oxygen chemistry at lower metallicity : other oxygen - bearing species are also less abundant .",
    "nitrogen chemistry is also suppressed , except when it is incorporated into hydrocarbons ( e.g. , cyanopolyynes ) .",
    "this means that the main nitrogen repository in the envelope shifts from n@xmath18  in galactic stars to hcn in magellanic stars .",
    "a similar trend is seen for heavy metals ( e.g. , si ) , where sic@xmath18  behaves like a hydrocarbon , but other silicon - bearing molecules are rarer .    physically , the lower expansion velocities of magellanic cses mean that the envelopes are more dense .",
    "this implies that neutral - neutral reactions in the inner envelope are more rapid , but the stronger radiation fields in the lmc and smc cause the molecular envelopes to be lesser in extent than in galactic cses .",
    "the ionisation fraction increases as metallicity drops , and the main charge carrier moves from a heavy metal ( mg@xmath29 ) in galactic envelopes to c@xmath29 .",
    "we have compared the results from the galactic model to the carbon star irc+10216 , and achieve reasonably good agreement in terms of molecular abundances and distributions .",
    "we discuss the qualitative results that have been obtained from infrared observations of carbon stars in the magellanic clouds , and also achieve good agreement , although constraints are few .",
    "finally , we use our models to predict line intensities and images as seen by alma .",
    "alma is expected to improve our understanding of carbon stars in the magellanic clouds , and lines of co , hcn , cs , cn , sio and sis should be detectable within 3 hours of observation in lmc carbon stars",
    ". lines of c@xmath18h and @xmath30co are predicted to be somewhat weaker , but may also be observable .",
