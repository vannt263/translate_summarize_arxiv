    "any reaction involving nuclear targets poses a challenge to nuclear theory .",
    "nuclear many - body effects come into play not only in the reaction mechanism , but also in the reaction amplitude and the description of final - state interactions .",
    "these many - body effects in general evolve dynamically during the course of a reaction and thus require a time - dependent framework for their description .",
    "for the experimenters the challenge is to draw conclusions from observed asymptotic particle yields , spectra and distributions on the interactions or the state of the matter during early stages of the collision .",
    "a well - known example is that of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "there the main aim is to investigate the properties of a transient state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma , involving quite different degrees of freedom than those being present both in the initial and the final states of the reaction , with the help of asymptotic , ` normal ' free particles .",
    "another example is given by the production of hadrons on nuclear targets using high - energy electron beams . here",
    "the aim is to understand time scales in hadronization and the search for the phenomenon of color transparency in hadron- or electron - induced reactions , where the observed final particle yield must be used to reconstruct the nuclear interactions in a very early stage of the reaction .",
    "this is very much the same as the challenge in the studies of short - range correlations between nucleons in nuclei which must be inferred from the final outgoing particles .",
    "a final example is that of neutrino - nucleus reactions , where the nuclear response must be understood in order to extract neutrino - oscillation parameters from so - called long - baseline experiments .",
    "common to all these quite different reactions and physics questions is the need to understand quantitatively the final - state interactions experienced by the outgoing particles .",
    "somewhat simpler are determinations of total inclusive cross sections . here",
    "final - state interactions enter only into the first interaction amplitude , but nevertheless they do determine in this way the total cross sections .",
    "the question then arises , which theoretical framework can be used to describe all these various reaction types .",
    "it is obvious that any reaction that preserves the phase coherence of the nuclear target can only be described by a quantum - mechanical reaction theory .",
    "an example is the coherent photoproduction of mesons on nuclear targets .",
    "however , as soon as the final state is not fully specified there are other options for their description available .",
    "the extreme case in this class is the total inclusive cross section with an elementary projectile without any information on specific final states of the target .",
    "an example is given by the total photoabsorption cross section on nuclei . here",
    "quantum - mechanical reaction theory can be used with its standard approximations , such as the impulse approximation with plane or distorted waves .",
    "the quantum mechanics of the nuclear many - body system enters here into the wave functions of the initial and final states .",
    "these can be approximated at various degrees of sophistication ; approximations for these states can range from fermi - gas descriptions over shell - model wave functions up to very sophisticated results of state - of - the - art nuclear many - body calculations .",
    "the same inclusive process can also be treated by transport theory by modeling the collision term for the first , initial interaction by using a plane wave approximation .",
    "indeed , results of such calculations for fully inclusive cross sections often show an agreement with data as good as that achieved in more sophisticated quantum mechanical approximation schemes .",
    "a more complicated case is the investigation of semi - inclusive reactions , i.e. , reactions , where one outgoing particle is measured in detail , with many other particles and an excited nuclear target being present . for this reaction type also",
    "quantum - mechanical approximations have been used that describe the final state again by an optical - model wave function . however , while such an ansatz may be quite appropriate for the description of total cross sections it must fail in its description of , e.g. , final - state energy distributions of knocked - out particles . the optical model can describe  through its imaginary part of the potential  the loss of flux of these particles when they traverse the nuclear target , but it contains no information where the lost particles go .",
    "it can also not describe any side feeding of reaction channels , where the final observed particle is not the one that was originally produced , nor can it describe energy distributions in situations , where the primary particles are being slowed down by final - state interactions .",
    "semi - inclusive reactions , that in addition often involve many particles in the final state , thus present a problem for quantum - mechanical approximations . here , transport theory is the method of choice .",
    "such a theory can in principle handle all final - state channels with many interacting particles present and includes naturally the processes of rescattering , absorption or side feeding ; its applicability is in general given if the many - body final state evolves incoherently .",
    "this has been recognized quite early .",
    "precursors of present - day transport theories were monte - carlo ( mc ) generators written to describe the final - state interactions in reactions of nucleons with nuclear targets . while the earliest suggestion of such methods goes back to serber  @xcite , the method has then been picked up by , among others , metropolis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , bertini  @xcite , and cugnon  @xcite . in 1983",
    "carruthers and zachariasen gave a very complete description of quantum collision theory @xcite .",
    "later on , with the advent of heavy - ion reactions , first practical implementations were developed to describe the dynamical evolution of a colliding nucleus - nucleus system @xcite while taking into account the hadronic potentials and the equation of state of nuclear matter within the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) theory .",
    "these codes thus went beyond the simple mc generators used until then that could not account for potential effects on the propagation of particles .",
    "the gibuu code , to be discussed later in this article , has its origins in this era ; it started with applications to heavy - ion reactions ( see @xcite and further references therein ) . with the availability of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion beams at the ags ,",
    "the cern sps , rhic , and the lhc this field has flourished ever since .",
    "models such as iqmd @xcite , relativistic buu @xcite , urqmd @xcite , rqmd @xcite , hsd @xcite ( which grew out of an early predecessor version of gibuu ) , and many other transport models ( for a comprehensive list see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are still widely used to extract properties of hot and dense matter from the final state observables .    on the other hand , little ( with protons as projectiles ) or no",
    "work involving transport - theoretical methods had been done on the description of inclusive or semi - inclusive reactions on nuclei with elementary projectiles , where simple ( sometimes oversimplified ) approximations such as the glauber treatment of final - state interactions prevailed .",
    "the first attempt to use transport - theoretical methods for the description of elementary processes on nuclei was an investigation of inclusive pion - nuclear reactions @xcite in an mc calculation .",
    "a first calculation within the framework of a buu theory of pion and @xmath3 photoproduction off nuclei was performed by the giessen group in @xcite with the same code that had been originally developed to describe heavy - ion collisions . since",
    "then buu theory has been used by that group to analyze a wide class of nuclear reactions involving elementary projectiles such as hadrons or electrons , photons , and neutrinos .",
    "the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) transport model , which grew out of these early studies , is a method and simulation code for hadron- , photon- , electron- , neutrino- , and heavy - ion - induced reactions on nuclei .",
    "it is based on a coupled set of semi - classical kinetic equations , which describe the dynamics of a hadronic system explicitly in phase space and in time .",
    "the initial state of the hadronic system either directly corresponds to the experimental conditions ( meson - nucleus , hadron - nucleus , and heavy - ion collisions ) or is obtained via external models ( photon- , electron- , and neutrino - nucleus reactions ) .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom are mesons and baryons , which propagate in mean fields and scatter according to cross sections which are appropriate for the energy range from a few @xmath4 to more than @xmath5 . in the higher energy regimes",
    "the concept of pre - hadronic interactions is implemented in order to account for color transparency and formation - time effects .",
    "the gibuu project is aiming to provide a unified theoretical transport framework in the mev and gev energy regimes for all the reaction types named above .",
    "the basic parameters , e.g. , particle properties and elementary cross sections , assume the same common values for all reaction types , thus allowing for a validation of the model over a wide range of phenomena and giving it some predictive power .",
    "this is what makes gibuu unique among all the other transport codes .",
    "the detailed comparison with many different experimental results also allows one to get a feeling for the inherent systematic uncertainties of the method , which are often unknown in other approaches . at the same time",
    ", the gibuu model contains a number of options like on - shell vs.  off - shell particle propagation , non - relativistic vs.  relativistic mean fields , various treatments of the nuclear ground state etc .",
    "that also makes gibuu a quite flexible theoretical toolkit , allowing to describe a given reaction on various levels of sophistication .",
    "the code itself is available under public license from @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is , on one hand , to set out the general framework of transport theory and its practical implementation . in that sense",
    "many of the methods and ingredients to be described can be found also in transport codes for heavy - ion reactions . on the other hand ,",
    "a specific implementation of transport theory is used to describe the power of the method in its application to various physics questions and to very different reaction types .",
    "such a implementation is provided by the gibuu transport code , developed by the authors mainly to describe interactions of elementary projectiles with nuclear targets @xcite .    in the first part of this paper , in [ sec : tranportequations ] , we briefly describe the theoretical basis of any transport theory , going back to the seminal work of kadanoff and baym @xcite and to the later derivation of relativistic quantum kinetic equations by botermans and malfliet @xcite that provided the theoretical basis for off - shell transport ; we will also outline the approximations that lead to the buu transport equations that are actually being used .",
    "a particular point here is the discussion of our treatment of off - shell transport of quasi - particle degrees of freedom with broad mass spectra , which presents a major development in practical implementations of transport theory during the last decade . in the following [ sec : buuingredients ] we describe in some detail the actual ingredients of the gibuu model .",
    "although similar ingredients can be found in any transport implementation we felt it necessary to discuss here as many details as possible in order to make the physics in the gibuu model transparent .",
    "only then can meaningful conclusions be drawn from detailed comparisons with other transport approaches and , more importantly , from analyses of experimental results .    then contains the center piece of this article , a discussion of physics results obtained with gibuu over a wide range of nuclear reactions and energies .",
    "the reactions discussed here range from low - energy pion - nucleus interactions over heavy - ion and antiproton reactions to reactions with electrons and photons on nuclei . finally a discussion of the very recent developments of neutrino - nucleus interactions is given , which is particularly important for neutrino long - baseline experiments .",
    "this broad coverage of very different nuclear reactions , all with the same physics input and the same code , is what sets gibuu apart from other transport codes , mostly limited to descriptions of heavy - ion reactions .",
    "a summary then concludes this article , to be followed by several appendices that contain detailed information on the cross sections used , which may be useful also for other transport models or mc generators , and on the numerical implementation in gibuu .",
    "the buu equation describes the space - time evolution of a many - particle system under the influence of mean - field potentials and a collision term , or more precisely , the time evolution of the wigner transform of the real - time one - particle green s function , which is a generalization of the classical phase - space density . for each particle species , within the buu approach one obtains an additional differential equation .",
    "all these equations are coupled through the gain and loss terms , which represent scattering processes , and by the mean fields , included in the hamilton functions . in this section ,",
    "we sketch the derivation of the generalized buu equation from nonequilibrium quantum field theory and discuss its approximations and solutions .      the appropriate starting point for the derivation of transport equations from the underlying fundamental",
    "many - body - quantum theory is the schwinger - keldysh real - time formalism of quantum field theory .",
    "we start our derivation of a transport equation for broad resonance - like quasi - particles by a brief review of relativistic off - equilibrium quantum - field theory in the schwinger - keldysh real - time formalism  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the motion of dirac particles and derive the transport equations within the operator formalism .",
    "the approach of off - equilibrium many - body theory within the path - integral formalism can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "we use the interaction picture , splitting the hamilton operator , @xmath6 in a `` free part '' , @xmath7 , and an `` interaction part '' , @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the equations of motion for the dirac - field operators , @xmath9 , evolving according to the hamilton operator , @xmath7 , can be solved exactly in terms of a time evolution operator @xmath10 .",

    "note that the opposite sign in [ eq : expt - value.3 ] compared to [ eq : eom - statop ] is included by the opposite , i.e. , `` anti - chronological '' , integration direction on the lower branch , @xmath26 , of the schwinger - keldysh contour .",

    "the result of the expectation value [ eq : expt - value.4 ] is obviously independent of the choice of the final time , @xmath24 , since the contributions from the upper and the lower branch of the contour for the time interval @xmath28 cancel each other . for the following ,",
    "it is convenient to let @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that this formalism can be extended to contour - ordered products of an arbitrary number of field operators .",
    "e.g. , the exact contour @xmath30-particle - green s function is defined by @xmath31          { \\ensuremath{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\psi}}}}(\\xi_1 ) \\cdots { \\ensuremath{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\psi}}}}(\\xi_n )          \\overline{{\\ensuremath{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\psi}}}}}(\\xi_n ' ) \\cdots          \\overline{{\\ensuremath{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\psi}}}}}(\\xi_1 ) \\right \\ } \\right ] ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] while the corresponding perturbative @xmath30-particle function is defined by the leading - order perturbative approximation of the time - evolution operator , @xmath32 .",

    "the perturbative expansion of expectation values can be established in a way very similar to the usual vacuum - quantum field theory .",
    "the main difference is that time - ordering is replaced by contour ordering , and that expectation values have to be taken with respect to the initial statistical operator , @xmath37 , and not with respect to the vacuum state .",
    "also the wick theorem for expectation values will in general not be valid in its simple form known from vacuum quantum field theory , but only for particular forms of the initial statistical operator , @xmath37  @xcite , i.e. , if the initial state of the system is of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an appropriate one - body operator .",
    "this means that many - particle correlations are neglected in the initial state .",
    "however , the full schwinger - keldysh formalism can not be applied for simulations of reactions .",
    "in fact , this formalism contains an infinite series of self - coupled equations : the one - particle green s function is correlated with the two - particle one , the two - particle green s function depends on the higher - order one , and so on . in that sense the schwinger - keldysh formalism contains all information on correlations of the many - body system .",
    "usually one includes these many - body correlations into a self - energy .",
    "the dynamics of the highly correlated system is then fully characterized by the dyson equation for the one - particle green s function , which contains the self - energy . for practical purposes",
    "one considers a truncation of the schwinger - dyson hierarchy on the two - particle level , and the problem is then reduced to the formulation of an approximation for the two - particle green s function .",
    "the simplest ansatz is to neglect correlations completely , i.e. , the two - particle green s function consists of two uncorrelated one - particle green s functions .",
    "this approach is well known as the hartree ( or by including antisymmetrization the hartree - fock ) method . on this approach",
    "phenomenological models are based , such as the hartree theory for quantum hadrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the dirac - brueckner ( or dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock )  @xcite approach goes beyond the simple hartree approximation by including a part of the two - body correlations . in the following we derive a general form of a transport equation starting from the dyson equations for the one - particle green s functions on the schwinger - keldysh contour within the dirac - brueckner approximation .    at first , it is more convenient to split the contour - two - point green s functions in a matrix - like fashion  @xcite .",
    "the time arguments of the matrix elements are then defined on @xmath40 , and the two matrix indices denote their location at the branch of the schwinger - keldysh contour , leading to the following definitions for the one - particle green s functions @xmath41 here , we have written the spinor indices , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , explicitly .",
    "the corresponding green s function for free particles are given in the analogous way by using the average @xmath44 as defined in [ eq : n - point - fct - free ] . as in vacuum - quantum field theory",
    "the perturbative expansion can be cast into a feynman - diagram formalism , where expectation values of observables are given by `` closed diagrams '' .",
    "in addition to the vacuum - feynman rules , each vertex carries a @xmath45-contour index , and for a @xmath46-vertex an additional factor @xmath47 has to be taken into account , which originates from the opposite integration direction over times on the @xmath46-branch of the schwinger - keldysh contour . by the same arguments as for the vacuum , the diagrams can be organized in classes as connected and disconnected parts , one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) amputated ( or proper vertex parts ) , etc .",
    "this implies that the same ( partial ) resummation techniques as in the vacuum can be formally applied also in the off - equilibrium many - body case , and the corresponding schwinger - dyson equations can be derived .    for the derivation of transport equations , we introduce the self - energy , @xmath48 , as the amputated 1pi two - point function . introducing the matrix notation",

    "in the following we do not write out the dirac indices explicitly , if not needed .    defining the inverse of the free green s function as the differential operator , @xmath53 the equation of motion for the free matrix - green s function",

    "accordingly , from [ eq : dyson.4 ] one finds that the corresponding equations of motion only involve retarded ( advanced ) parts , @xmath57 for the off - diagonal elements in [ eq : dyson.2 ] , one obtains the equations , @xmath58 which provide the space - time evolution of the single - particle properties of the particles in the system encoded in the special propagator , @xmath59 . for example , the following spinor traces at equal space - time coordinates determine the vector - current and scalar densities , @xmath60 , \\quad \\rho_s(x)={\\ensuremath {       \\left \\langle { \\overline{{\\ensuremath{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\psi}}}}}(x )      { \\ensuremath{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\psi}}}}(x ) } \\right \\rangle}}=-{\\mathrm{i}}\\operatorname{tr}[s^{<}(x , x)].\\ ] ] later , after wigner transformation and gradient expansion , one transforms ( [ eq : dyson.7 ] ) to generalized transport equations for the corresponding density distributions in phase - space together with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyson.6 ] ) for the retarded or advanced green s functions , which determine the spectral properties of the single - particle states  @xcite .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : dyson.7 ] ) provides an exact equation of motion for the one - particle green s function .",
    "however , this set of equations requires the definition of the self - energies in terms of the exact green s functions , involving an `` infinite tower '' of coupled schwinger - dyson equations for the complete set of @xmath30-point functions of the quantum field theory .",
    "thus , one has to choose an approximation scheme in order to cut this hierarchy of schwinger - dyson equations to a finite coupled set of @xmath30-point green s and vertex functions .",
    "the usual starting point is perturbation theory , which however is not well suited for our purpose of off - equilibrium many - body theory .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the formulation of truncation schemes which are at the same time `` conserving '' ( i.e. , obeying the conservation laws for conserved quantities like total energy , momentum , angular momentum , and charge - like quantum numbers ) and are thermodynamically consistent in the equilibrium limit , i.e. , bulk properties fulfill the usual maxwell relations between the corresponding thermodynamical potentials .",
    "a promising starting point for the derivation of transport equations for particles with large spectral widths is the use of @xmath61-derivable approximations , where @xmath61 is a functional of the mean fields and exact propagators , defining self - consistent equations of motion for the mean fields and self - energies by a variational principle , which fulfill the above mentioned physical constraints .",
    "it has been shown by baym that the derivability of the equations of motion from a functional of this kind is not only a sufficient but also a necessary condition for self - consistent approximations fulfilling all these properties  @xcite . in recent years",

    "an investigation of a corresponding test - particle description has been given in  @xcite .",

    "the functional derivative [ eq : os - transp.1 ] then leads to the skeleton expansion for the self - energy in terms of full propagators , i.e. , as the sum over all self - energy diagrams with propagator lines that do not contain self - energy insertions . in this way",
    "the @xmath61-derivable approximation avoids double counting of diagrams automatically . in equilibrium , for the solution of the self - consistent dyson equations for the self - energies at given temperature and chemical potential(s ) , at the same time @xmath61 becomes part of the grand - canonical potential and thus leads to definitions for the thermodynamical quantities consistent with the one - particle dynamics provided by the self - consistent equations of motion for the self - energies .",
    "of course , for practical purposes , the @xmath61 functional has to be truncated in some way , e.g. , given by the number of interaction vertices or loops since otherwise it again leads to the exact equations of motion , involving the full schwinger - dyson hierarchy of equations for all @xmath30-point green s and vertex functions .",
    "sometimes also partial resummations are used for @xmath61 functionals , e.g. , the ring - summation diagrams to obtain landau - fermi - liquid theory or the dirac - brueckner approximation given below . in this way",
    "truncation schemes are defined for which the averaged noether currents of underlying symmetries ( including energy - momentum conservation from space - time - translation invariance and current - conservation laws from ( global or local ) gauge symmetries ) fulfill the conservation laws exactly . at the same time the self - energies obey the principle of detailed balance , and the scheme is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "one example for such a scheme , leading to a transport equation for spin - symmetric nuclear matter which closely resembles the original boltzmann equation , is the dirac - brueckner scheme .",

    "in this method different weights can be assigned to every test particle . in the first step , for a given fixed impact parameter , every real projectile particle is simulated by @xmath453 test particles ( per ensemble ) , with each one of them being weighted by the factor @xmath450 .    for a correct calculation of the total cross section ,",

    "this optimization also allows for testing some modified physics : in the case of very high energy proton - induced collisions , hard probes do not scale with @xmath464 , but instead with @xmath465 .",
    "this can be simulated by not quitting the loop over the target test particles after an interaction , but just continuing .",

    "then , the difference of the canonical four - momenta which appears in the energy - momentum conserving @xmath172-function of [ dsig_12_to_12n ] can be replaced by the difference of the kinetic four - momenta , and , therefore , @xmath518 where we have assumed that the outgoing particles are on their ( dirac ) mass shells , @xmath519 , and the @xmath236-body phase - space - volume element is defined according to ref .  @xcite as @xmath520 the in - medium threshold condition follows immediately from [ dsig_12_to_12n_propto ] , @xmath521 with @xmath522 being the in - medium excess energy and @xmath523 .",
    "defining now the `` free '' invariant energy as @xmath524 leads to the evaluation of the vacuum cross section at the in - medium excess energy , which obviously respects the true in - medium threshold condition [ q * ] .",
    "unfortunately , the definition [ s_free_threshold ] is channel dependent and is hard to apply in practice . in most cases ,",
    "the final - state particles are not known until the actual simulation of a given two - body collision is done .",
    "thus , we further assume that the sum of scalar fields is the same for initial and final particles , i.e. , @xmath525 , which allows us to rewrite [ s_free_threshold ] as @xmath526 we recall here the definition of the dirac effective mass according to [ m_i^star ] . the expression ( [ s_free_rmf2 ] )",
    "is used in the rmf - mode calculations . in the present rmf implementation ,",
    "the conditions @xmath517 and @xmath525 used in the derivation of [ s_free_rmf2 ] are fulfilled , since the coupling constants of all baryons with the meson fields are chosen equal to the nucleon - meson coupling constants , while the mean - field potentials acting on mesons are neglected .",
    "the only exception is the baryon - antibaryon annihilation into mesons ( see [ sec : antiprotona ] ) .",
    "the phase - space distribution , @xmath527 , which enters in the pauli blocking factor , @xmath528 , is calculated by counting the number of test particles in the phase - space volume element composed of small spherical volumes @xmath529 with radius @xmath530 centered at @xmath531 in coordinate space and @xmath532 with radius @xmath533 centered at @xmath119 in momentum space , @xmath534 where @xmath535 is a normalization factor . in [ f_i ] , the sum is taken over all test particles , @xmath233 , of the type @xmath536 whose momenta belong to the volume @xmath537 . in coordinate space , the test particles are represented by gaussians of the width , @xmath538 , cut off at the radial distance @xmath539 , in a similar way as done for the folding of the density fields with gaussians , see [ sec : vlasov ] .",
    "the default values of parameters are @xmath540 , @xmath541 , @xmath542 , @xmath543 .",
    "this set of parameters is a compromise between the quality of the pauli blocking in the ground state and the smallness of statistical fluctuations in the case of simulations with @xmath544 test particles per nucleon .",
    "typically , this is sufficient in accuracy for modeling heavy - ion collisions at beam energies above @xmath545 .",
    "however , for small - amplitude dynamics near the nuclear ground state , like the giant monopole resonance vibrations studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the accuracy provided by [ f_i , kappa ] is not sufficient , when the default parameters are used .",
    "the main reason is the constant , i.e. , momentum - independent radius , @xmath533 , which introduces a spurious temperature of the order of several mev . to reduce this effect ,",
    "we have introduced a position- and momentum - dependent radius of the momentum - space volume @xmath537 by @xmath546 $ ] , which provides a sharper fermi surface .",
    "this allows us to use the reduced parameters also in coordinate space , @xmath547 , @xmath548 , @xmath549 .",
    "the final - state decision is straight forward in the case of resonance production . if there are two or three particles in the final state , the treatment is more involved .",
    "first , in , we discuss the treatment in the vacuum .",
    "then the medium corrections are discussed .",
    "the general definition of the cross section for @xmath550 reactions is given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath551 where @xmath552 denotes the @xmath30-particle phase space of the final - state particles , @xmath553 @xmath554 stands for the symmetry factor of the final state , and @xmath555 represents the invariant flux factor of the particles , @xmath475 and @xmath476 . in the center - mass ( cm ) frame",
    "this flux factor reads @xmath556 with the cm momentum , @xmath557 , of the particles , @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "it can be shown ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cf .  especially section 4.7 ) from the one used in this work . ] ) , that one can express the cross section for the production of unstable particles @xmath558 and @xmath559 in the final state by @xmath560 with @xmath561 and @xmath562 denoting the cm momenta of the @xmath563 and the @xmath564-system , respectively .",
    "are specializations of this expression . here",
    ", one has to assume that the matrix element depends on @xmath423 only . in the vacuum",
    "the spectral functions depend on the squares , @xmath565 , only , while in the medium , in general , they are functions of the four momenta .",
    "we want to use a monte - carlo method to choose the final state . in [ twoparticlefinal ] , we note that the two - particle final state depends both on the masses of the outgoing particles and their directions of motion .",
    "the mandelstam variable , @xmath423 , and @xmath561 are determined by the initial state .",
    "thus we choose the masses , @xmath566 and @xmath567 , at the same time as we choose the angles , @xmath271 .",
    "the transformed random number , @xmath568 , @xmath569,\\qquad,\\quad    { \\mathrm{d}}y= { \\mathrm{d}}\\mu    \\frac{\\gamma_0}{(\\mu - m^0)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_0}{2}\\right)^2 }    \\label{eq : randomtransform2d}\\ ] ] is distributed according to a cauchy - lorentz distribution , which leads to the the function , @xmath570 smoother than the original function [ twoparticlefinal ] , which is advantageous for the application of a rejection method . for @xmath571 one",
    "has to insert the values at the pole position in the vacuum @xmath572 and @xmath573 of particle @xmath558 and @xmath559 .    for the rejection procedure ,",
    "we choose @xmath574 , @xmath575 , and @xmath271 according to a flat distribution .",
    "the probability that a random ensemble , @xmath576 , will be accepted is then given by @xmath577 the maximal value in the denominator is actually hard to find .",
    "we parameterize it by @xmath578 the dimensionless factor , @xmath579 , is of the order of @xmath580 and depends on the outgoing particles .",
    "it has to be readjusted if one introduces medium effects .      for a three - particle final state one obtains in analogy to [ twoparticlefinal ]",
    "the complicated structure , @xmath581 here , @xmath582 denote the cm momenta of the particles , @xmath558 and @xmath559 .",
    "the cm momentum of @xmath583 is given by total momentum conservation , @xmath584 in analogy to the two - particle final state , we apply the variable transformation [ eq : randomtransform2d ] to [ threeparticlefinal ] and obtain @xmath585 hence , we need to choose @xmath574 , @xmath575 , @xmath586 , @xmath587 , @xmath588 , and @xmath589 independently of each other .",
    "the limits for the @xmath590 are given by the smallest and largest possible masses .",
    "the absolute values of the momenta , @xmath591 , are limited by energy conservation , @xmath592 .",
    "the value of @xmath593 is determined by choosing a random @xmath594 $ ] and @xmath595 $ ] .        in the medium we have more complicated dispersion relations .",
    "therefore also the phase - space factors differ from the ones used above . already in @xcite possibilities to implement the right phase - space factors for @xmath597 and @xmath447 scattering have been discussed .",
    "our treatment does not include such modifications , but preserves the energy in the medium for all collisions .",
    "we use the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "evaluate @xmath598 .",
    "2 .   do the final - state decision with vacuum kinematics assuming @xmath599 .",
    "3 .   correct the final state by scaling the final - state momenta by a factor , @xmath87 , in the cm frame .",
    "the last point needs special discussion . in the cm frame ,",
    "energy and momentum conservation in step 2 result in a solution for the momenta @xmath600 , which obeys @xmath601 the zeroth components of @xmath602 are , due to the potentials , highly non - trivial functions of the vector components , @xmath603 .",
    "hence we use the following recipe : using the vacuum result for @xmath600 we choose @xmath604 where the scaling factor , @xmath87 , is fixed by [ econs ] .",
    "since all momenta are scaled by the same factor , momentum conservation is fulfilled trivially .",
    "the numerical implementation of the gibuu model is based on fortran2003 using modern programming paradigms and a version control management ( subversion ) .",
    "see the gibuu website @xcite and section 3.1 and appendix c in the dissertation of o.  buss @xcite for detailed information on the current code structure and its programming history .",
    "the code runs and has been tested with numerous compilers on different platforms , details are given on our website @xcite . at this website ,",
    "one also finds information about program options and a documentation of the parameters .",
