    "close binary systems containing a stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) black hole ( bh hereafter ) and a neutron star ( ns ) or a white dwarf ( wd ) would emit gravitational waves ( gw ) . as a result , the two component stars approach each other almost adiabatically . at the final stage of such an evolution",
    ", binary systems would become sources of various astrophysical phenomena .",
    "they are one of the most promising sources of gravitational wave emission , which will be detected by the ground based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors ( ligo / virgo / tama / geo , see e.g. abramovici et al .",
    "1992 and cutler et al .",
    "they are also expected to be one of the possible sources of @xmath1ray bursts ( grb ) ( e.g. paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "because of the gw emission , the orbit of a binary system becomes circular and the separation of two components decreases adiabatically . for the final states of such bh  star systems , we can expect several different possibilities ( see e.g. kidder , will & wiseman 1992 , lai , rasio & shapiro 1993a , and references therein ) .",
    "one is inspiraling on a dynamical time scale as a result of the tidal or the general relativistic ( gr ) effect .",
    "as is well known , there is an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a test particle around the bh field such as the schwarzschild solution .",
    "even if the gr effect is neglected , newtonian tidal field makes the orbital motion unstable as shown in numerical simulations for binary star systems .",
    "furthermore , the dissipation as a result of the gw emission produces a radial component of the velocity .",
    "consequently the binary system would begin to merge by inspiraling dynamically .",
    "in other words , the fluid star would fall on to the black hole on a short dynamical time scale .",
    "the other possibility is the roche overflow , i.e. the mass transfer from the fluid star to the black hole .",
    "when the star could approach a state in which the roche lobe is filled up without suffering from dynamical instability , a certain amount of matter of the star would overflow from its roche lobe to the black hole or environment . even after this mass overflow , the star and the black hole may still remain in a stable binary system or at least some amount of matter may orbit around the bh longer than the dynamical time scale ( see kochanek 1992 , bildsten & cutler 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "these two possibilities are also suggested by recent hydrodynamical simulations for synchronously rotating binary systems @xcite .",
    "configurations of such binary systems can be approximated well by quasi - stationary models even just before the merging process or the overflow process starts , because the time scale of the gw emission is much longer than the orbital period ( see e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "thus we can discuss final stages of the evolution of binary systems by computing sequences of stationary configurations ( see e.g. lai , rasio & shapiro 1993b ( lrs1 hereafter ) and 1994a ( lrs2 ) ) .",
    "stationary sequences representing evolutionary tracks can be constructed as follows .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the masses of components are conserved during the evolution and that the equation of state ( eos ) and the viscosity of the fluid star are fixed .",
    "if the time scale of change due to viscosity is much shorter than that of the evolution due to the gw emission , the spin of the ns is synchronized to the orbital motion .",
    "we call a point source and a corotating star a roche type binary configuration . on the other hand",
    ", there is another possibility that the binary configuration can tend to settle into a state in which the fluid star rotates with zero vorticity in the inviscid limit ( kochanek 1992 ; bildsten & cutler 1992 ) .",
    "we call it an irrotational roche  riemann ( irr ) binary configuration",
    ". these two types of configurations correspond to extended models of ellipsoidal equilibria for binary systems studied by roche and by aizenman to more realistic models in which deformation and compressibility of fluid are fully taken into account ( see e.g. chandrasekhar 1969 and aizenman 1968 ) .    by using such stationary configurations , the final stages of the evolution of binary systems can be discussed . as the separation of two objects decreases , the roche or the irr type binary system finally reaches a critical distance .",
    "the critical distances for these systems are discussed in lrs1 by using the ellipsoidal approximation for the fluid component .",
    "the final fates of the bh - ns systems depend on the type of the critical state which the binary system first approaches . as was stated in their paper , there appear to be three types of critical distances in the framework of newtonian gravity",
    ". these critical states can be found by analyzing stationary sequences by expressing physical quantities as a function of the separation of the centers of the mass of binary components , @xmath2 .",
    "the turning point of physical quantities such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 corresponds to the point where some instability sets in , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the total angular momentum and the total energy , respectively .",
    "for the roche type binaries , the secular instability will set in at the separation for which functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 reach their turning points which correspond to minima of these functions . at this point ,",
    "the rotation of a gaseous star will change secularly owing to the viscous effect .",
    "the point where the dynamical instability will set in is expected to be located at the smaller separation than that of secular instability .",
    "the component stars are thought to coalesce as a result of this dynamical instability at this point .",
    "according to lrs1 and the well - organized hydrodynamical simulations of synchronously rotating ns - ns binary systems , differences of values of these two distances are rather small and hence the hydrodynamical instability sets in around the states at the turning points of the curves of the physical quantities ( see e.g. rasio & shapiro 1992 , 1994 ; shibata , oohara & nakamura 1997 ; but see also new & tohline 1997 ) .",
    "we denote the separation at the turning point of @xmath3 or @xmath4 as @xmath7 . for the irr type binaries",
    ", the turning point corresponds to the dynamical instability limit and there is no secular instability limit because the system is not subjected to the influence of the viscosity .",
    "we denote the radius at the turning point for the irr sequences as @xmath8 .",
    "another critical distance for the bh - ns binary sequence is the roche(riemann ) limit where the separation of two components is a minimum or the roche lobe filling state where the matter fills up its roche lobe .",
    "we denote the corresponding separation as @xmath9 .    according to the results of lrs1 in which the ellipsoidal approximation of the polytropic star has been used",
    ", the relation @xmath10 is always satisfied for the irr binary systems . in other words , the irr binary systems at the roche ",
    "riemann limit are always dynamically unstable . for the roche binary systems , the conditions @xmath11 or @xmath10 are satisfied for almost all polytropic indices @xmath12 and almost all mass ratios @xmath13 in which realistic values for the bh - ns binary systems are included ( see also lrs2 section 2.4 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate stationary sequences of the roche and the irr binary systems for distances near the critical radii .",
    "we obtain _ numerically exact _ stationary configurations of the binary systems . by using these sequences",
    ", we will show that , contrary to the results obtained from the ellipsoidal approximation , there exist dynamically stable roche and irr configurations in a wide range of parameters , i.e. @xmath9 appears earlier than @xmath7 or @xmath8 as the separation decreases .",
    "this is because those configurations around the critical radii , in particular at @xmath9 , can not be expressed well by the ellipsoidal approximation even for fairly stiff equations of state because of a large deformation of the stellar envelope due to compressibility ( ury & eriguchi 1998a , paper i hereafter , 1998b ) .",
    "if the roche(riemann ) limit appears for the larger separation than the other hydrodynamical instability limit , the final stage of the evolution of binary systems would be drastically different from the previously suggested scenario .",
    "in other words , the roche lobe overflow or the mass transfer from the star to the black hole is likely to occur instead of unstable plunge of the star to the black hole .",
    "we will compute stationary sequences for various polytropic eos s and mass ratios and reveal the interrelation of critical radii on the sequences . note that whether such a mass transfer proceeds stably or not should be examined carefully because it could depend crucially on the realistic eos of the ns and so on .",
    "concerning the gravitational field , it is still very difficult to take into account the gr effect to such binary systems which contain bhs . as a first step of this kind of research",
    ", we only treat newtonian gravity both for the black hole and for the fluid star .",
    "however , we will estimate the gr effect and suggest that there exists a possibility of mass overflow from the star component for realistic values of the parameters of binary systems .",
    "such systems consisting of a point source and a compressible fluid star have not been discussed yet for fully deformed configurations from the standpoint of stationary structures of binary systems .",
    "therefore our present results will be useful when results in newtonian or gr hydrodynamical simulations of bh  ns or wd systems will be obtained .",
    "the solving method of synchronously rotating binary systems has been established by several authors ( hachisu & eriguchi 1984a , 1984b ; hachisu 1986 ) . recently",
    ", the method for irrotational binary systems has also been developed by the present authors ( paper i ) .",
    "since detailed computational methods are described in these papers , we will briefly summarize the assumptions , the formulation of the problem and the computational method below .      as mentioned in introduction",
    ", we consider binary systems consisting of a point source and a compressible fluid star .",
    "we assume the polytropic relation for the eos of the fluid star : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath12 and @xmath18 are the pressure , the density , the emden function which is proportional to the enthalpy , the polytropic index and a constant , respectively .",
    "the emden function is used in the actual numerical computations .",
    "however note that the emden function defined here is not normalized as usual ones treated in spherical polytropic stars . from the present knowledge of the neutron matter , the realistic ns s are approximated by polytropes with index @xmath19 , ( see lrs2 and references therein ) and some wd s or low mass main sequence stars are approximated by polytropes with @xmath20 .    as for the gravitational force , we employ newtonian gravity .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath21 consists of a contribution from the fluid star itself , @xmath22 , and that from the bh , @xmath23 .",
    "the former is expressed in the integral form of the poisson equation as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and the integration is performed over the stellar interior @xmath26 . for the latter potential we assume as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath29 is the distance from the bh to each fluid element of the star .    because of dissipation due to the gw emission",
    ", we may assume that the binary orbit becomes circular before the coalescence .",
    "this assumption breaks down when the hydrodynamical instability or the gr effect produces a radial infall velocity .",
    "the radius where the infall velocity can not be ignored is that of the isco . on the other hand ,",
    "since we neglect all gr effects , we can construct exact circularly orbiting binary configurations even when the star fills the roche lobe . using these configurations",
    "we can discuss the ` purely ' hydrodynamical stability of the system .",
    "furthermore , if the star is not so relativistic , we can assume that the evolution due to the gw emission is adiabatic so that the binary can be regarded in a quasi - stationary state just before the coalescence @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the gr effect in a later section .",
    "we can also assume the existence of rotating frames of reference whose angular velocity relative to the inertial frame coincides with the orbital angular velocity of the binary system @xmath30 . in this frame , shapes of binary stars are static .",
    "we use this rotating frame in the actual computations .    concerning the spin state of the fluid component , we consider the following two cases .",
    "one is a synchronously rotating state ( roche type ) . in other words ,",
    "every fluid element of star is rotating with the same constant angular velocity @xmath30 around the axis of orbital rotation of the binary system . the other is an irrotational state in which the vorticity vanishes everywhere in the fluid in the inertial frame of reference ( irr type ) .",
    "we use the spherical coordinates @xmath31 whose origin is located at the geometrical center of the star . the distance from the rotational axis to the origin , @xmath32 ,",
    "is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are distances from the rotational axis to the inner and the outer edges of the star ( i.e. the points of the star nearest to the rotational axis and furthest from it ) , respectively .",
    "the star is assumed to be equatorially symmetric .",
    "furthermore we assume symmetry about the plane which is defined by the rotational axis and the geometrical center of the star . since the formulation must be different for the roche type configurations and for the irrotational models",
    ", we will briefly explain two corresponding formulations .      for the roche type binary system ,",
    "the equation of continuity becomes trivial and the equation of motion is integrated to the following bernoulli s equation : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distance from the rotational axis to the fluid particle and defined by @xmath38 and @xmath39 an integration constant .",
    "the emden function can be obtained from equation ( [ gberno ] ) . the green s function @xmath40 which appears in equation ( [ intpot ] )",
    "can be expanded as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is defined as , @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the legendre function and @xmath1 is the angle between two position vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 .      for the irr binary system , we will solve for _ stationary _ structures because the star has non - zero spin even in the rotating frame .",
    "since we assume that the vorticity of the fluid component vanishes in the inertial frame , we can introduce the velocity potential @xmath47 in the inertial frame as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the velocity vector in the inertial frame .",
    "the euler equation of the fluid can be integrated to the generalized bernoulli s equation as follows in the rotating frame : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the orbital angular velocity vector of the binary which is identical to the angular velocity vector of the rotating frame relative to the inertial frame .",
    "here we have used the stationarity of the configuration in the rotating frame .",
    "we note that the steady velocity @xmath52 in the rotating frame is related to @xmath49 as follows : @xmath53 since we assume configurations are in stationary states , the equation of continuity is expressed by using the velocity potential as follows also in the rotating frame : @xmath54 for the irr binary systems , the emden function and the velocity potential are basic variables which can be obtained from equations ( [ bern1 ] ) and ( [ conti ] ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for these two variables are as follows : @xmath55      these basic equations are transformed into the surface fitted coordinate system for the irr binary system as described in paper i. for the roche binary system , we use the surface fitted coordinate system for models with polytropic index @xmath56 . for polytropes with @xmath57",
    ", we use the ordinary spherical coordinate system .",
    "stationary configurations are obtained by using the scf method developed by ostriker & mark ( 1968 ) .",
    "the detailed numerical method for the roche binary system can be found in hachisu  ( 1986 ) and that for the irr binary system in paper i.    coordinates are discretized as @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , where @xmath60 are the numbers of grid points .",
    "for the roche type binary systems , we have chosen @xmath61 for models in the surface fitted coordinates and @xmath62 for models in the ordinary spherical coordinates .",
    "although the number of grid points for the surface fitted coordinates is smaller than that of the ordinary spherical coordinates , the surface fitted coordinate system attains higher accuracy and greater robustness .",
    "we have computed @xmath63 models by using both coordinate systems and checked that two results agree very well .",
    "for example , differences of critical radii were less that @xmath64 .",
    "for the irr type binary systems , since the equations are more complicated than those for the roche type binary systems , we use @xmath65 to keep higher accuracy .",
    "we also take the number of the terms of the legendre expansion @xmath66 in the equation ( [ legen ] ) up to @xmath67 for the roche case with the surface fitted coordinate , and for other models @xmath68 . in the hscf scheme ,",
    "configurations are solved iteratively by starting from a certain initial guess .",
    "we can obtain converged solutions after @xmath69 iterations for the roche cases and @xmath70 iterations for the irr cases .",

    "is written as follows :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the speed of light .",
    "derivation of this formula is shown in the book of misner , thorne & wheeler  ( 1970 ) ( see also eriguchi , futamase & hachisu 1990 ) .",
    "this angular momentum dissipation rate is related to the energy dissipation rate as follows : @xmath110        as mentioned in introduction , we can discuss the critical radii of binary systems by using the stationary sequences .",
    "one can find a comprehensive discussion on these critical radii in lrs s papers in which the ellipsoidal approximation is used ( see for example lai , rasio & shapiro 1993a , 1994b ) .    according to lrs",
    ", three different types of critical radii can be identified by examining the behavior of @xmath111 or @xmath112 for the roche type sequences .",
    "the turning point of the @xmath111 or @xmath112 curve corresponds to the point where the secular instability sets in .",
    "we denote this separation as @xmath7 .",
    "since the assumption of the synchronous rotation implies that the viscosity of neutron matter is strong enough , viscosity can change the flow field of the fluid star and the star secularly evolves to a configuration with a lower energy even when the system is in a configuration at the turning point of the energy curve .",
    "however , we also note that the evolutionary time scale due to the gw emission is almost comparable to the dynamical time scale at the configuration corresponding to the turning point of the energy curve .",
    "there is another critical radius on the sequence where the dynamical instability sets in , i.e. @xmath113 . to determine @xmath8",
    ", it is necessary to compute non - synchronously rotating configurations ( see lrs1 ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to construct such non - synchronously rotating configurations with generic flows ( see for e.g. ury & eriguchi 1996 , and references therein ) . according to the ellipsoidal approximation of lrs and the dynamical simulations for the _ ns - ns _ binary systems ( rasio & shapiro 1992 , 1994 ; shibata , oohara & nakamura 1997 ; oohara , nakamura & shibata 1997 ; ruffert , rampp & janka 1997 ; new & tohline 1997 ) , @xmath8 is smaller than that of the secular instability limit , @xmath114 , and these two radii are very close .",
    "for these kinds of _",
    "ns  ns _ binary systems , they showed that the instability of orbital motion begins around these radii .",
    "since we can expect that the situation is similar for binary systems of a point source and a fluid star , we only discuss @xmath7 hereafter and regard it as the radius where the instability of orbital motion sets in .",
    "we also refer to this instability , associated with inspiraling motions , as the hydrodynamical instability in this paper .",
    "the origin of this instability is purely a newtonian tidal effect for the fluid component .",
    "the other critical radius is the roche limit @xmath9 which corresponds to the smallest separation of the stars along the sequences or the roche lobe filling states . to determine this limit",
    ", we need to compute sequences by changing the parameter @xmath78 to smaller values until the inner edge of the fluid star forms a cusp .",
    "the configuration with such a cusp can be identified as the roche lobe filling state .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath2 is the roche limit @xmath115 of the sequence .",
    "it should be noted that it is possible for @xmath9 to appear at a larger separation than @xmath8 or @xmath7 or both and hence the critical radius @xmath8 or @xmath7 disappears . in this case , by considering equation ( [ quad ] ) , the evolutionary time scale due to the gw emission does not become zero .",
    "therefore the gw emission would not drive a significant radial velocity .",

    "the dynamical instability limit disappears for the models with larger polytropic indices and with larger mass ratios as mentioned before .",
    "as shown in previous subsections , we have found that the locations of critical radii , in particular that of @xmath9 , are quite different from those computed from the ellipsoidal approximation ( lrs1 ) .",
    "moreover , there is a possibility that the fluid star reaches the roche(riemann ) limit without suffering from hydrodynamical instability because the critical radius such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 disappears on the stationary sequences for rather stiff eos .",
    "the reason for this difference of @xmath9 can be explained by considering the large deformation of the stellar envelope due to compressibility of the stellar matter as follows ( see also paper i ) : the deformation of the envelope due to the tidal force becomes large , and , in particular , that around the inner parts near the bh becomes larger than that of other parts .",
    "because of this significant deformation of the envelope , a cusp is formed at the inner edge and hence the sequence is terminated at a larger separation @xmath143 than that for the ellipsoidal approximation . therefore the difference between our results and those of lrs1 for the critical radii becomes significant . in figures [ rocm10n05.con ] and [ rrm10n05.con ]",

    "star binary systems , the gr effect plays an essential role for the stability of the binary system when the star is sufficiently compact .",
    "kidder , will & wiseman ( 1992 ) developed a method to compute the radius of isco , @xmath146 , by taking the gr effect into consideration to some extent .",
    "they treated a system consisting of two point masses including the post - newtonian effect up to @xmath147 order and also incorporated the effect of the schwarzschild geometry exactly .",
    "lai , rasio & shapiro proposed a fitting formula for their results in lrs2 as follows : @xmath148 \\ , . \\ ] ] we use this formula to estimate roughly the gr effect . in figure",
    "[ irr-crit-rg.gra ] , we draw the critical radii for the irr sequence and the non - dimensional radius @xmath149 which is defined as follows : @xmath150 @xmath151 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the normalization is the same as equation ( [ idnorm ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath152 expresses the compactness of the neutron star .",
    "we have chosen @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "values of @xmath156 and @xmath155 almost correspond to those of typical neutron stars with , say , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , @xmath158 , respectively .    in this figure ,",
    "three parallel curves drawn from upper left to lower right are those of @xmath149 and they correspond to @xmath160 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 from the top to the bottom curves , respectively .",
    "we can see that @xmath161 , which is the instability limit due to the gr effect , can be comparable with the roche - riemann radius @xmath136 for a binary system with a less compact neutron star with @xmath162 and moderate mass ratios .",
    "therefore the configuration at the roche - riemann limit @xmath9 could be stable even if the gr effect is included and hence the mass overflow instead of unstable plunge is expected to occur .",
    "the same mechanism can be applied for the roche type binary systems , because , as we can see from tables [ roc-crit.tab ] and [ irr-crit.tab ] , the values of @xmath9 are almost the same both for the roche binary systems and for the irr binary systems .",
    "taniguchi & nakamura ( 1996 ) have investigated stability of the roche type binary systems by using the improved pseudo - newtonian potential and the ellipsoidal approximation .",
    "because of the ellipsoidal approximation , the hydrodynamical instability limit always appears on the solution sequence of their result as lrs1 , which is in contrast to our present result .",
    "recently , kluniak & lee ( 1997 ) performed numerical simulations for binary systems of a point source and a synchronous rotating star by using the sph method .",
    "they reported models with mass ratios @xmath119 and @xmath163 for polytropes with @xmath164 . in their paper",
    ", they have shown that not the unstable plunge but the mass transfer occurs for @xmath165 . the resulting mass transfer from ns to bh and matter distribution around",
    "the bh vary significantly .",
    "they have concluded that the system is a promising source of grb .",
    "our computation qualitatively agrees with their result . for the roche binary with @xmath164",
    ", our result shows that @xmath7 disappears around @xmath166 .",
    "although this value is different from the result of simulations , values of radii @xmath7 and @xmath136 , and hence @xmath8 are very close as seen in figure [ roc-mass-radi.gra](d ) .",
    "therefore the possibility of mass overflow is also supported in this respect .",
    "if such a mass overflow occurs , we need to consider the following problem .",
    "does this mass transfer continue stably or not ?",
    "stable mass transfers lead to the survival of a less massive ns and the bh ",
    "ns binary systems with a much smaller mass ratio @xmath13 are formed after the mass transfer .",
    "this process depends on several factors such as the amount of mass escaped from the ns and that accreted onto the bh , and on how the structure of ns and its roche lobe have changed as a result of overflow and so on .",
    "qualitative discussions ( see kochanek 1992 ; bildsten & cutler 1992 , and references therein ) suggest that such stable mass transfer seems difficult .",
    "quantitative examination is possible by using our stationary method .",
    "we will investigate this problem in the future .",
    "let us consider the case that the bh ",
    "ns binary evolves stably along the stationary sequence and reach the roche(-riemann ) limit @xmath136 without suffering from hydrodynamical instability .",
    "it is natural to expect that the gw signal emitted from such a binary system would change at a critical radius and from the frequency there we may be able to determine the critical radius , @xmath9 in our case .    by comparing tables [ roc-crit.tab ] and [ irr-crit.tab ] ,",
    "the physical quantities around the critical radii are almost the same for the roche and the irr type binary systems .",
    "in particular , the difference of @xmath9 between the roche and the irr types is less than @xmath167 and @xmath64 for polytropes with @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "this is irrespective of the mass ratio for the range @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , we can not decide whether the star is in a synchronously rotating state or in an irrotational state from the observation of the gw . in other words ,",
    "the gw signal contains information about eos but not about the rotational state .",
    "therefore we can only determine @xmath9 and the stiffness of the ns .",
    "on the other hand , it seems difficult to extract some new information for the viscosity of neutron matter from the gw signal emitted at this stage .",
    "note , however , the spin of ns may be accurately determined by using the higher order pn expansion for the inspiraling phase ( see for e.g. mino et .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .      in this paper",
    "we have systematically examined the sequences of a point source and a fluid star binary systems .",
    "we have assumed the fluid star to be a polytrope and employed newtonian gravity .",
    "we have found that the critical radii , @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 are quantitatively different from those computed by using the ellipsoidal approximation for the star .",
    "we have clarified that @xmath8 or @xmath7 disappears even on binary sequences with a moderate mass ratio and a stiff eos and hence the existence of dynamically stable roche(-riemann ) limit has been shown .",
    "this suggests a possibility of mass overflow instead of an unstable plunge due to the hydrodynamical instability of binary systems at the final stage of the binary evolution due to the gw emission .    for further investigations , we should take into account effects of the black hole field , the radial velocity and so on . though it is very difficult to numerically construct the realistic bh",
    ", the pseudo - newtonian potential can represent the marginal instability of the gr effect around the schwarzschild bh field .",
    "taniguchi & nakamura ( 1996 ) have used an improved pseudo - newtonian potential and the ellipsoidal approximation to determine the innermost stable circular orbit of bh - ns systems .",
    "such a pseudo - newtonian potential will be included straightforwardly in our present scheme for a fully deformed configuration of stars .",
    "newtonian approximation for the fluid star component is insufficient for ns models whose gravity is considered as strong as , more or less , the second post - newtonian approximation of general relativity . recently several authors have solved the ns - ns configuration including the gr effect ( shibata 1997 ; baumgarte et al .",
    "1997 ) . the formulation for the irrotational star in gr gravity is also proposed ( bonazzola , gourgoulhon & marck 1997 ; asada 1998 ; shibata 1998 ; teukolsky 1998 ) . by implementing these results",
