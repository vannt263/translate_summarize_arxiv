    "the boundary between the interstellar material ( ism ) and the surrounding intergalactic material ( igm ) is often characterized by ram pressure interaction which plays an important role in galaxy evolution via the stripping of gas and regulating the gas reservoir for star - formation and fueling of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the strength of ram pressure that is exerted on the ism depends primarily on two physical properties , the density of the ism and the relative velocity of the galaxy , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "while the ism mass at small radii is dominated by molecular gas , the outer disks of galaxies are primarily atomic .",
    "neutral atomic hydrogen with its 21 cm line emission ( hi ) is the most sensitive tracer of the dynamics in the outskirts of galaxies and provides an ideal tool to identify interaction features since it is often the most spatially extended component of a galaxy s disk and is very sensitive to interactions because of its dissipative nature .",
    "in particular , observations of the nearest galaxy cluster , the virgo cluster , have brought tremendous insight about the stripping of ism from spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "here we propose a novel approach utilizing kinematic features caused by ram wind interaction with diffuse , outer hi disks at igm densities that are an order of magnitude lower than in galaxies that show ram pressure stripping . in principle",
    "this provides a unique tracer of the properties of the intergalactic medium and a three - dimensional measurement of the direction of a galaxies movement with respect to the rest - frame of the igm .",
    "in particular the amplitude of the velocity change in the ism due to ram pressure can provide important information about the density of the igm and the galaxy s relative speed with respect to the igm .",

    "however , not all anomalies in the observed velocity field can be attributed to warped disks .",
    "one important question is how to distinguish kinematic features of warped disks from ram interactions . in this study",
    "we develop a kinematic model of ram pressure interaction in the outer hi disk of galaxies and test these models on nearby galaxies . our kinematic disk model of ram pressure interaction",
    "is described in   [ sec : mathmodel ] which includes the derived mathematical description (   [ subsec : math ] ) and the implication on the hi velocity field (   [ subsec : velfield ] ) , models of velocity perturbations due to ram pressure and warped disks (   [ subsec : model ] ) , and the velocity decomposition using monte carlo fitting routines (   [ subsec : mcmc ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : comp ] we compare our ram pressure models to the observed hi kinematics of nearby disk galaxies and discuss the implications for deriving the properties of the igm in   [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are summarized in   [ sec : sum ] .",
    "ram pressure is exerted on the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a galaxy due to its motion relative to an intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "since the relative velocities are typically 100 s of km  s@xmath1 , while the sound speed in the neutral ism ( with temperature less than about @xmath4  k required for a significant neutral fraction * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is less than about 10  km  s@xmath1 , this is a highly supersonic interaction .",
    "the kinematic outcome will depend on whether the interaction is adiabatic or radiative .",
    "if the gas is collisionally heated to a high enough temperature that radiative losses are insignificant , such as may occur in cluster - cluster mergers for example , then the velocity difference can be calculated on the basis of kinetic energy conservation .",
    "if , on the other hand , the heat of the collision is efficiently radiated , as must apply to any residual atomic ism , then only the condition of momentum conservation applies to the calculation of the perturbed velocity .",
    "the interaction causes a drag force to be exerted on the outer gas of a galaxy and can , in extreme cases , strip much of its interstellar gas .",
    "the strength of interaction between the igm and the gas bound by the gravitational potential of a galaxy depends primarily on the following three parameters : 1 ) the relative velocity , @xmath5 , of the galaxy with respect to the igm , 2 ) the density of the igm , @xmath6 , and 3 ) the exposed surface area , @xmath7 , of the ism towards the ram wind . the ram pressure , @xmath8 , is usually defined as @xcite , @xmath9 and the component of the ram force parallel to the galaxy s disk on a gas element is given by @xmath10 and perpendicular by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angle between the wind direction and the galaxy s plane .",
    "the gas within a volume element with a surface area @xmath13 and a thickness @xmath14 of the gas disk will be assumed to be either diffuse gas ( homogeneously distributed over a volume element ) or clumpy ( see fig .",
    "[ illustration ] for illustration ) . in the diffuse case",
    ", the gas has a constant density @xmath15 within a volume element and the surface area , @xmath16 . in the clumpy case",
    ", the gas is distributed over a number of individual gas clouds within the volume element , with volume filling factor , @xmath17 . for a population of isotropic objects",
    ", these will have a surface covering factor , @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 . in the context of two neutral atomic phases in approximate pressure equilibrium @xcite ,",
    "these two cases might be identified with the warm and the cool neutral medium ( wnm and cnm ) respectively with a volume density contrast of about 100:1 . for the wnm , @xmath20 ,",
    "while for the cnm , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we will assume that the galactic gas is distributed as a thin plane that is not exactly edge - on relative to the igm motion .",
    "a relevant question to consider is the depth in the disk to which the ram pressure wind will propagate . for a diffuse disk of thickness , @xmath23 pc and sound speed , @xmath24 km  s@xmath1 ,",
    "the disk penetration time , @xmath25 myr , is much shorter than a disk rotation period for @xmath26 . in the case of a clumpy ism with a small volume filling factor like",
    "the cnm noted above , the disk penetration timescale is unlikely to be different , since most of the disk volume is filled with a low density medium with a high shock propagation speed .",
    "the probability condition for not having multiple clumps along the same line - of - sight is given approximately by @xmath27 implying @xmath28 for the cnm . even in cases of approximate alignment of clumps ,",
    "the inter - clump shock would tend to bend around obstructions and act on the entire disk volume within this characteristic penetration time .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that gas cloud shadowing plays a significant role in influencing the outcome of a ram pressure interaction with a galactic disk .    our analysis will also be confined exclusively to the low - ram pressure regime , i.e. at ram pressure accelerations that do not lead to significant stripping of gas . in the event that the relative galaxy - igm velocity greatly exceeds the galactic rotation speed , as is the case in galaxy clusters , where the ram pressure is one to two orders of magnitude larger than in galaxy groups , significant asymmetries of the stripped material will occur , such as leading side - trailing asymmetries as seen for some galaxies in the virgo cluster ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the force opposing the ram pressure is the gravitational binding force of the galaxy , which is roughly equal to the centrifugal force , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the rotation velocity of the ism at a radius @xmath31 from the galactic center and @xmath32 the mass of the gas in the volume element with @xmath33 is independent of whether the gas is diffuse or clumpy .",
    "the ratio @xmath34/@xmath35 describes the relative impact of the ram pressure on the ism in the galactic disk and is basically a measure of the strength to disturb the motion of the ism . for diffuse gas , this effective ram parameter is given by @xmath36 and for clumpy gas by , @xmath37 that differs only by the clump surface covering factor , @xmath22 , that applies to the cnm .",
    "since diffuse gas has a much higher surface covering factor than a clumpy gas , it requires much smaller ram forces to disturb the motion of the diffuse ism . in extreme cases ,",
    "i.e. @xmath38 , this can lead to ram pressure stripping as seen for high @xmath6 as e.g. demonstrated in galaxy clusters .",
    "the effective velocity change @xmath39 of the ism due to ram pressure can be described via momentum conservation in the approximation of an fully dissipative collision between the ism and igm , @xmath40 in the rest - frame of the galaxy ( @xmath41 ) , this equation reduces to @xmath42 and using @xmath43 ( diffuse gas ) and @xmath44 , the effective velocity change is given as @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the effective velocity change of the ism can be approximated by @xmath47    the effective velocity perturbation induced by this momentum transfer in each portion of the disk can only be integrated over a fraction of the rotational period of the gas around the galaxy s center due to the continuously changing relative orientation of the ram wind . on longer timescales ,",
    "the orbital paths themselves will be modified by the accumulated ram pressure acceleration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) together with gravitational restoring forces of the galaxy potential .",
    "we will discuss the long - term consequences of the ram pressure interaction and the implications for the interpretation of a galaxy s velocity field in detail in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] . for the following",
    "we assume that at all times there is a basic orbital configuration of essentially circular gas orbits on which is superposed a kinematic perturbation that is constant on timescales that are a small fraction of a rotational period .",
    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is often the most spatially extended component of a galaxy s disk and is very sensitive to interactions because of its dissipative nature .",
    "in particular the kinematics of diffuse gas may respond in a measurable way to ram forces long before significant displacement or removal of gas from the disk has occurred .",
    "thus one might expect to be able to measure the ram pressure and hence the properties of the igm at much smaller densities than those found in galaxy clusters ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this might be accomplished via detailed study of the hi kinematics in the outer part of galaxies , where we find diffuse atomic gas at low column densities ( and hence large @xmath49 ) .    in the following",
    "we develop a model to quantify the effect of ram pressure on the hi velocity field of a galaxy . to describe the transition from a clumpy to a diffuse ism we use a smooth step function as given by , @xmath50 this function",
    "returns values between 0 and 1 where the parameter @xmath51 and @xmath52 define the critical density threshold and the smoothing range , respectively .",
    "this models the rapid decline of the hi column density and surface covering factor of clumps in the outer disk , which scales the effective ram pressure to 0% for very dense regions and 100% for low density diffuse gas .",
    "however , the critical density @xmath51 where such a change occurs is not known beforehand and can be only determined by fitting simultaneously the columns density distribution and amplitude of velocity perturbation in observed galaxies .",
    "we have tested other scale functions in order to describe the impact of the ram force on the gas kinematics as function of hi gas density ( e.g various power laws ) , but came to the conclusion that a smooth step function provides a reasonable match to the observed kinematics ( see   [ sec : comp ] ) . however , the overall 2-dimensional pattern as seen in the velocity field is roughly the same , independent of the hi density scale function , since it parametrizes only the dependence on the clumpiness of the hi gas . the line - of - sight velocity , which is the only velocity component that is directly observable @xmath53 with @xmath54 here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the position of the rotation center in the plane of the sky ( x , y ) , @xmath31 the radius in the plane of the disk ( x , y ) , @xmath57 the systemic velocity , @xmath58 the rotational velocity at a radius @xmath31 , @xmath59 the rdial velocity , @xmath60 the inclination angle and @xmath61 the position angle of the receding major axis of the galaxy measured in anti - clockwise direction from north toward the east . in the following we will set @xmath62 and @xmath63 and we will assume first a constant pa and inclination of the disk .",

    "the long - term consequences on the geometry of the gas disk are investigated in detail in another study @xcite and are summarised only briefly here . in most circumstances ,",
    "namely if the ram wind is moderately inclined to the disk , a constant ram pressure over long time intervals induces an `` s - shaped '' warped disk ( m=1 mode ) with an orientation that depends on the direction of the galaxy s motion through the igm and whether the galaxy is rotating in a clockwise or counter - clockwise sense .",
