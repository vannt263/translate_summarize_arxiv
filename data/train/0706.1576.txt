    "in certain quantum systems with nonlinear energy spectra , a suitably prepared wave packet will , in the course of its evolution , regain its initial form periodically .",
    "this is known as the revival of the wave packet . at some intermediate times",
    ", the evolving wave packet will break up into a set of replicas of its original form .",
    "this is known as the fractional revivals of the wave packet @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the phenomena of revival and fractional revival occur in the wave packet dyanmics of various atomic , molecular and optical systems such as rydberg atoms  @xcite , optical parametric oscillators  @xcite , the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite , transient signals from multilevel quantum systems  @xcite , potential wells  @xcite and molecular vibrational states  @xcite .",
    "extensions to systems for which the energy spectrum depends on two quantum numbers , have also been made in recent years  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been experimentally observed in both atomic @xcite and molecular systems @xcite .",
    "a widely used method for probing the revival dynamics of wave packets is based on a study of the autocorrelation function @xcite .",
    "this method is directly related to the observable signal in the pump - probe type experiments for studying the wave packet dynamics .",
    "the autocorrelation function for an evolving wave packet @xmath0 is given by the overlap integral @xmath1 .",
    "the auto - correlation function is a time series whose fourier transform ( ft ) will reveal all the frequencies , but will be unable to provide any information on when a particular frequency appears .",
    "this is important in the present context as the frequencies are time - varying . in other words , fractional revivals of a particular order",
    "occurs at particular instants of time .",
    "what is really desirable is a time - frequency analysis of the auto - correlation function such that we not only know all the frequencies , but also get information on when a particular frequency occurs .",
    "this is the objective of the present work .    for the purpose of time - frequency analysis ,",
    "short - time fourier transform ( stft ) has often been used in the literature .",
    "this method divides the whole time series in several windows , each of certain fixed width .",
    "then the ft is performed in each window for obtaining the frequency information .",
    "unfortunately , the time - frequency information obtained by this method has not always been satisfactory as its fixed window length does compromise on the frequency resolution .",
    "the method of continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) @xcite overcomes the preset resolution problem of stft by using a variable length window .",
    "this transform , by design provides good localisation in both time and frequency .",
    "the subject area of wavelets , developed mostly over the last fifteen years , is at the forefront of much current research in pure and applied mathematics , physics , computer science and engineering .",
    "this transform has emerged over recent years as a powerful time - frequency analysis .",
    "a narrow window is used for the analysis of the high frequencies and gives a better time resolution .",
    "a wider window is used for the analysis of low frequencies and gives a better frequency resolution . the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) of a signal @xmath2",
    "is defined as @xmath3 this transformed signal is a function of two variables , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are used respectively to scale and translate the wavelet window whereas @xmath6 is the complex conjugate of the transforming function known as the mother wavelet for the cwt . in our study",
    "we have used the morlet wavelet as the mother wavelet . the contribution to the signal energy at the specific scale @xmath4 and location @xmath5",
    "is given by the two dimensional wavelet energy density function known as the scalogram : @xmath7 the frequencies are inversely proportional to the scale parameter , and thus @xmath4 and @xmath5 together help provide information in the time - frequency plane .",
    "in this paper , we present a case study to show that a wavelet based time - frequency analysis is superior in many ways to the standard time - domain analysis of the auto - correlation function .",
    "we consider a rydberg wave packet which is a superposition of circular hydrogenic states having @xmath8 @xcite . the time dependent wave function for a localized wave packet formed as a one dimensional superposition of eigenstates may be written as    @xmath9    as a pre - requisite for obtaining fractional revivals , we assume that the weighting probabilities @xmath10 are strongly peaked around a mean value @xmath11 with a spread @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to expand the energy eigenvalues @xmath13 ( in atomic unit ) in a taylor series in n as follows .",
    "@xmath14    neglecting the overall time dependent phase and considering up to the second order term , we may write @xmath15 as @xmath16    where each term in the expansion defines important characteristic time scale that depend on @xmath11 ;    @xmath17    since the energy spectrum is known in this case , one obtains @xmath18 the absolute square of autocorrelation function is @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "[ auto1](a ) shows a plot of @xmath21 as a function of time .",

    "although we can get complete frequency information in this way , we do not have any idea on which frequency appears at what time . on the other hand ,",
    "the autocorrelation time series can be recovered by using the inverse fft , but the frequency information goes away completely .    our goal is to acquire some frequency information in some particular times of interest . in the next section , we make use of continuous wavelet transform to investigate how one is able to resolve time and frequency in a better way .",
    "wavelet based time - frequency representation or scalogram of the time series data @xmath28 is shown in fig .",

    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the rms duration and bandwidth respectively of the mother wavelet @xmath33 , where @xmath31 is given by @xmath34 the term inside the square root is the second moment of the wavelet centered at @xmath35 .",
    "similarly the bandwidth of the wavelet is @xmath36 this mother wavelet is then used to build a set of daughter wavelets by translating @xmath33 in time , and by dilating or contracting @xmath33 , which not only adjusts the mean frequency but also the spread of the daughter wavelet .",
    "consider the case , when the mother wavelet is scaled by @xmath4 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "the rms duration becomes @xmath39 and the corresponding rms bandwidth is @xmath40 .",
    "it implies @xmath41 , which is independent of the scaling parameter @xmath4 .",
    "also , the rms bandwidth is not affected by the translation parameter @xmath5 because translating a function does not affect the magnitude of its ft . for our chosen mother wavelet @xmath33 , eqs .",
    "( [ delt ] ) and ( [ delomega ] ) yield @xmath42 so that @xmath43 , which is independent of scaling and translation",
    ". thus the uncertainty of time localisation is accompanied by an increase in the uncertainty of frequency localisation or vice versa .    referring to fig .",
    "[ ryd3 ] , we note that several patches appear in a rectangular array on the time - frequency plane .",
    "each patch is centered about a particular frequency and a particular time . to help us understand the occurrence of these patches , we undertake an analytical approach as described below .",
    "recall that the absolute square of the autocorrelation function is given by eq .",
    "( [ auto20 ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath44 , the cwt of @xmath2 can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the morlet with shifted time @xmath5 and scaled by @xmath4 : @xmath47     ( in the unit of @xmath48 ) and frequency ( in the unit of @xmath27 ) are in a.u.,width=307,height=211 ]    substituting in eq .",
    "( [ tf1 ] ) and performing the integration over @xmath49 , we get @xmath50 maximum values of @xmath51 , corresponding to a particular scale parameter @xmath4 should occur whenever the factor @xmath52 approaches unity .",
    "this gives rise to a constraint : @xmath53 since the distribution functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are peaked about @xmath11 , the central frequency of each frequency band in fig .",
    "[ auto1](b ) can be obtained by setting @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is an integer .",
    "since @xmath59 is positive , we must insist that @xmath58 is a _ positive _ integer . substituting in eq .",
    "( [ tf4 ] ) and using the quadratic approximation  ( [ phase1 ] ) for the energy eigenvalues , we immediately get @xmath60 since the scale parameter @xmath4 is related to frequency @xmath61 by the relation @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we finally obtain the simple formulae @xmath64 the above formula correctly predicts the central frequencies around which the spectral components are clustered in the frequency plane as was shown earlier in fig .",
    "[ auto1](b ) .",
    "note that each horizontal band in fig .",
    "[ ryd3 ] has a spread about its central frequency .",
    "we will now show that the terms corresponding to these frequencies add up coherently in the expression for @xmath51 at a particular time @xmath5 given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an integer .",
    "coherent addition of terms would require that the phase factor @xmath67 be the same for these terms .",
    "that is , for arbitrary values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , one should be able to satisfy the condition @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an integer number . using the approximation  ( [ phase1 ] ) , it is now easy to show that @xmath5 is indeed given by the expression  ( [ frac ] ) .",
    "an equivalent and simpler way of deriving this result is to insist that the phase factor @xmath72 is independent of @xmath68 .",
    "the expression  ( [ frac ] ) gives us the time instants at which @xmath73 is peaked .",
    "specifically , it tells us which frequency beats occur at what times .",
    "the lowest frequency beats @xmath74 occur for @xmath75 at times @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , .... similarly , the frequency beats @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath81 , occur at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath77 , .... thus the patches appearing in the bottom row give the transition frequency between any two consecutive levels ( @xmath75 ) , the ones on the next row are the transition frequencies corresponding to @xmath81 and so on . in this way ,",
    "frequency bands , depicted in fig .  [ ryd3 ] , trace out the signature of fractional revivals .",
    "thus interestingly , in time - frequency plane , one can find both time and frequency information from the two time scales @xmath85 and @xmath86 by using the expressions  ( [ frac ] ) and  ( [ freq ] ) .",
    "in fact , these two expressions provide the location of each patch in the time - frequency plane .",
    "as an example , let us consider the fourth maximum or patch in the third harmonic appearing in fig .",
    "[ ryd3 ] . here , the third harmonic corresponds to @xmath87 , so the frequency information corresponding to this patch can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ freq ] ) , which is @xmath88 a.u .",
    ", as shown in fig .  [ ryd3 ]",
    ". the corresponding value for time can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath89 , and @xmath87 , so the patch will appear at @xmath90 .    , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) show @xmath91 for @xmath92,@xmath93 and @xmath94 ( in unit of @xmath95 ) respectively .",
    "times are scaled by revival time and @xmath91 is scaled by @xmath96.,width=451,height=556 ]",
    "it is seen that the wavelet based time - frequency representation provides localisation in both time and frequency .",
    "higher order fractional revivals and their localisation in time are clearly manifest in the time - frequency plane .",
    "we showed how @xmath86 and @xmath85 are themselves sufficient to explain the time - frequency plane completely .",
    "note also that the square of the autocorrelation function , plotted as a time series , does not resolve fractional revivals unambiguously .",
    "more precisely , the order of the fractional revival can not always be determined .",
    "in contrast , the time frequency representation introduces a parameter @xmath58 through eqs .",
    "( [ freq ] ) and ( [ frac ] ) that clearly separates out the fractional revivals in a rectangular array on the time - frequency plane . in fig .",
    "[ tfr2d ] , we show how the corresponding @xmath4 values filter out fractional revivals from the complicated plot of the autocorrelation function . for @xmath75 , one can find @xmath4 using eq .  ( [ freq ] ) .",
    "this specific @xmath4 value can filter out the signature of fractional revivals as shown in fig .",
    "[ tfr2d](b ) . this is also true for the higher order harmonics as shown in fig .",
    "[ tfr2d](c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) for @xmath81 , @xmath87 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "these specific values of @xmath4 , filter out the signature of the corresponding higher order fractional revivals",
    ".    the time - frequency representation can be useful for a wave packet that decays before its revival time .",
    "although the short - time evolution of @xmath73 can still be used to estimate @xmath85 , no information can be gained about @xmath86 if the energy spectrum of the system is _ not _ known . however , as long as the wave packet survives long enough for some patches to occur in the scalogram ( see fig .",
    "[ short ] ) , one can use eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) to estimate @xmath86 .",
    "what makes this possible is the better resolution available in the time - frequency plane for the detection of fractional revivals .",
    "in conclusion , we have made use of the continuous wavelet transform to demonstrate the time - frequency representation of autocorrelation function for the wave packet dynamics of a rydberg wave packet . an analytical approach is provided to interpret the time - frequency plane and explain our numerical observations .",
    "we have shown that the time - frequency representation not only provides a complementary method of analyzing fractional revivals , it is a better tool in resolving fractional revivals .",
    "finally , it is shown that the time - frequency representation may be able to extract information about the revival dynamics of a short - lived system even if the system decays before reaching its revival time .",
