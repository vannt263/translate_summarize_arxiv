    "the dynamics of recurrent neural network models with synchronous updating has been of interest ever since the work of little @xcite .",
    "it is expected that little s model with binary units and symmetric hebbian couplings should exhibit either cycles of period two or fixed - point attractors and it has been suggested that the cycles could arise in statistical mechanics from a duplication of phase space by means of two state variables for every unit .",
    "an equilibrium analysis , based on replica symmetry , predicted that period - two cycles associated with a full spin flip ( all units changing sign at each time step ) should occur in a zero temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "this was recognized as an unphysical phase apparently disconnected from the ordinary high temperature paramagnetic phase . a somewhat large negative self - interaction @xmath0 ( the diagonal elements of the synaptic matrix ) between units turned out to be necessary for this cyclic solution with full spin flip to appear @xcite .",
    "early numerical simulations failed to show the presence of those cycles and lead to the conjecture that the problem with the statistical mechanics approach could be due to the assumption of replica symmetry .",
    "indeed , the entropy of this phase was found to be negative , going to @xmath1 as @xmath2 @xcite , a feature that usually goes together with replica symmetry @xcite . in a further work",
    ", a zero - temperature calculation of the average number of cycles as a function of the fraction of flipping spins demonstrated that period - two cycles with full spin flip are by far the most common type of cycles below a storage ratio of patterns @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the usual calculation of the average number of metastable states does not say anything about the macroscopic properties , in particular about the overlap with a chosen pattern .",
    "fixed - point solutions for the macroscopic parameters that emerge from a dynamics with a finite fraction of spins changing sign at each time step are common , but not exclusive , to the phase diagram of little s model .",
    "indeed , they also appear in recent studies of three - state ising and blume - emery - griffiths neural network models with synchronous updating .",
    "these models can be thought as extensions of little s model with generalized synaptic interactions and multi - state units @xcite .",
    "only a small fraction of neurons that change sign appear to be involved in the stationary states @xcite , and the work in those studies was mainly devoted to fixed - point solutions for the macroscopic parameters . on the other hand , stationary period",
    "- two solutions for the macroscopic parameters , that arise from a fraction of units changing sign at each time step , have been found in recent work on the synchronous dynamics of symmetric sequence processing without a self - interaction @xcite .",
    "the relation between the dynamics of the macroscopic parameters and the fraction of units that change sign at each time step is crucial to understand the behavior of synchronous networks .",
    "a dynamical study may be helpful to get further insight into the asymptotic behavior of little s model .",
    "so far , only the results of an approximate synchronous dynamics are available , which become exact for an asymmetrically random diluted network in the limit of extreme dilution @xcite .",
    "this dynamics predicts that , at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , either frozen - in fixed points or frozen - in cycles of period two may appear when @xmath6 , for a positive or a negative self - interaction , respectively , where @xmath7 is the initial overlap with a chosen pattern . on the other hand",
    ", there is a flow to a fixed point @xmath8 reached in time @xmath9 , when @xmath10 .",
    "thus , both the size and the sign of the self - interaction play a crucial role and the same dynamics , for small non - zero @xmath11 , predicts a flow either to a paramagnetic or to a retrieval state .",
    "frozen - in states do not evolve in time and they are an undesirable feature for associative memory . in the present context , they are states in which the overlap either remains fixed at @xmath7 ( frozen - in fixed - point ) or oscillates between @xmath7 and @xmath12 ( frozen - in cycle of period two ) .",
    "the correlation function between two consecutive time steps , related to the fraction of flipping spins , is @xmath13 for a frozen - in fixed - point and @xmath14 for a frozen - in cycle of period two .",
    "the question that arises is if the frozen - in states actually are stable in little s fully connected model subject to synaptic and/or stochastic noise , and the main purpose of this paper is to deal with that issue following the transient behavior of the dynamics that yields the stationary states of the network .",
    "the full dynamics of the hebbian synchronous recurrent network of binary units , either at zero or at finite temperature with stochastic noise , including eventually the region where period - two cycles dominate has , apparently , not been carried out before . we make",
    "use of a generating functional approach ( gfa ) @xcite , exact in the mean - field limit of an infinitely large system , combined with the numerical simulation procedure of eissfeller and opper ( eo ) , based on the gfa for the dynamics of disordered spin systems .",
    "this is a procedure free of finite size effects @xcite .",
    "the problem with spin - glass - like models ( neural networks among them ) is that the dynamics may be very slow .",
    "due to that , in particular for not too small @xmath15 in both cyclic and in retrieval states , the numerical simulation may require a large number of time steps in order to reach a stationary behavior , making the computation prohibitive with the eo procedure .",
    "a further purpose of the paper is to overcome this problem by means of an alternative procedure that is introduced in this work and which consists mainly of two features .",
    "one is the neglect of memory effects that involve the response function in the self - energy term of the single - site effective field , which amounts to a signal - to - noise approximation ( sna ) @xcite .",
    "the second feature consists in doing analytically the summation over states in the gfa .",
    "thereby one accounts for the microscopic variables in the calculation of the dynamics of the macroscopic properties in a way that involves a much smaller number of variables .",
    "the procedure is exact for @xmath5 , and yields an approximation for small @xmath11 , that can be done in a short computing time up to a large number of time steps producing results in excellent agreement with the procedure of eo for finite @xmath16 and sufficiently large values of @xmath17 .",
    "we make use of both our and the eo procedure in what follows .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model and present a brief summary of the now well known gfa supplemented with an adaptation of the eo procedure to our system . in section 3",
    "we discuss our alternative procedure and in section 4 we show the results of the transient dynamics up to the asymptotic states for the overlap and the correlation function between two consecutive times .",

    "it is worth noting that a paramagnetic state has also been found in an asymmetric extremely diluted synchronous network in the presence of stochastic noise at @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath160 .",

    "one has to be certain that the true asymptotic state is reached in the course of the dynamics .",
    "it is in order to deal with very long transients that already appear for moderate values of @xmath15 and low values of synaptic and/or stochastic noise , which are heavily time consuming in the computations with the eo procedure , that we developed our alternative dynamical procedure within the generating functional approach .",
    "the procedure consists in neglecting the retarded self - interaction term in the local field and performing explicitly the summation over states that enters into the calculation of the macroscopic quantities of interest , and it amounts to the numerical solution of a set of equations for the relevant macroscopic parameters that involves a gaussian correlated average , and it becomes exact in the absence of stochastic noise .",
    "thus , we can perform the computations over a much longer number of time steps in a shorter computing time than the procedure of eissfeller and opper .",
    "the procedure also yields results in very good agreement with the eo procedure in the case of small stochastic noise , finite @xmath16 and large values of @xmath17 , within the time scale where both procedures are applicable .    finally , some concern about our alternative procedure . although it is exact only in the absence of stochastic noise , that is for @xmath5 , our results for @xmath131 and a rather small @xmath61 should be reliable and it does not seem to be justified at this stage , where we are not concerned with full phase diagrams , to include memory effects in the retarded self - interaction due to the states of the units at other than just the previous time step . on the other hand ,",
    "reasonable calculations can be done with the alternative procedure over longer time scales which would be needed to obtain results for larger ratios of @xmath169 .    despite the fact that the use of our alternative dynamics is justified for sufficiently small stochastic noise ( small values of @xmath11 )",
    ", it may be interesting to consider its extension for a larger amount of noise .",
    "even an approximate estimate of the retarded self - interaction @xmath76 , based on the dominating features of the response function @xmath45 , would be useful for that purpose .",
    "a hint in that direction could come from simulations of eissfeller and opper for @xmath45 .",
    "preliminary calculations in that direction , for small non - zero values of @xmath16 and @xmath11 , show that the response function is close to zero for most times , except for the presence of two peaks .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the alternative procedure could be useful in the dynamics of other synchronous neural network models with a finite self - interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the procedure should also be useful for the study of the dynamics of other disordered systems .",
    "furthermore , the procedure can also be applied to neural network models with @xmath170 , including in the memory term of the effective local field ( [ 11 ] ) only the term which relates the state of the system at time @xmath9 to that at time @xmath171 . in this case",
    ", it would be necessary to obtain an equation for the response function .",
    "this , and related issues will be explored in a separate work .",
