    "a fraction of these thermal neutrinos deposit their energy in the pns atmosphere , driving a wind with mass loss rate @xmath2 that injects energy into the shocked stellar material and forms a pns wind driven bubble in the sn cavity  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for nonrotating and nonmagnetic pnss ,",
    "the wind kinetic energy is tiny compared to the ccsn explosion energy , and the wind is nonrelativistic throughout the cooling epoch  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , if pnss are rotating and magnetized , they transit from nonrelativistic and thermally driven to relativistic and poynting dominated winds  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetization of the flow is  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pns radius , @xmath5 is the surface dipolar field strength , @xmath6 is the angular frequency of the pns , and @xmath7 takes into account that the outflow comes from only the open fraction of the pns surface .",
    "the transition from nonrelativistic to relativistic winds occurs at @xmath8 where the alfvn speed becomes @xmath9 as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "neutrons are naturally loaded in the pns wind via neutrino heating , and they are also important for synthesis of heavy nuclei  @xcite . around the base of the outflow , neutrons and ions",
    "are tightly coupled via elastic collisions , so neutrons are accelerated together with ions as the poynting - dominated outflow is accelerated by magnetic fields .",
    "although it has been known that the magnetic energy of the flow is not efficiently converted to kinetic energy in ideal mhd  @xcite , efficient acceleration is strongly motivated to explain the jets of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galaxies , and can be achieved by rapid time - variability or magnetic dissipation in the flow  ( see a review * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "once the outflow becomes relativistic enough to exceed the pion - production threshold , inelastic collisions are naturally expected as the main dissipation process of relativistic neutrons .",
    "the relevance of the @xmath10 reaction has been suggested in the context of grbs  @xcite , where internal collisions due to outflow inhomogeneities or neutron decoupling have been considered .",
    "however , this process is even more generic .",
    "as we show in this work , as rotating magnetized pnss cool and @xmath2 decreases , neutron decoupling occurs at radii where the flow has already become relativistic and where the neutrons are above the pion production threshold .",
    "the neutrons then interact with the material decelerated by the shock and possibly with the overlying stellar material , producing @xmath11  gev neutrinos .",
    "detecting this signal would probe the otherwise completely obscured process of jet acceleration and the physics of rotating and magnetized pns birth during the core collapse of massive stars .    rapidly rotating and/or strongly magnetized pnss are particularly interesting objects since they may be related to various explosion phenomena .",
    "estimates suggest that @xmath12% of ccsne lead to magnetars with @xmath13  g  @xcite , which may be generated by rapid rotation via the dynamo mechanism  @xcite .",
    "rotation and/or magnetization can also modify the explosion dynamics .",
    "if the wind power exceeds @xmath14 , the wind can be collimated , forming relativistic jets  @xcite that may lead to grbs  @xcite . although only a fraction ( up to a few percent ) of ccsne harboring relativistic jets may be observed as ccsne with a relativistic component  @xcite , trans - relativistic ccsne  @xcite may belong to such a class .",
    "if the rotation rate or magnetic field strength is not sufficiently high , a quasispherical wind or a pair of choked jets hidden by the stellar material may result  @xcite , potentially leading to ( nonrelativistic ) hypernovae and super - luminous supernovae  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "magnetically driven ccsne have been of interest and studied for many years  @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we consider a neutrino driven pns wind , by which baryons are naturally loaded in the outflow .",
    "as a pns cools , the outflow becomes baryon poor and @xmath15 becomes @xmath16 , so it will be magnetically accelerated rather than thermally accelerated .",
    "we show that the transition can happen in the kelvin - helmholtz cooling time scale when the pns is rotating and magnetized . in section iv",
    ", we show that neutron decoupling happens after neutrons are accelerated together with ions while they are coupled .",
    "additional neutrons may be generated by photodisintegration of nuclei , if electrons are accelerated around the termination shock of the pns wind .",
    "then , in section vi , we show that @xmath0  gev neutrinos should be generated via the @xmath10 reaction and further boosts to the expected flux may come from the neutron - proton - converter ( npc ) acceleration  @xcite and/or shock acceleration mechanisms . in section vii , we see that these neutrinos can be detected by planned facilities such as pingu  @xcite and hyper - kamiokande ( hk )  @xcite . finally , as discussed in section viii , their characterization would allow us to probe the physics of pnss , early dynamics of the jet or wind , and magnetic acceleration in an environment inaccessible to photons .    throughout this work ,",
    "we use @xmath17 in cgs units unless otherwise specified .",
    "mass loss from pnss occurs during the pns cooling phase by neutrino heating , mainly via @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in unmagnetized winds  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the neutrino ( @xmath22 ) luminosity and @xmath23 is the typical neutrino energy , which can be affected by rotation  @xcite .",
    "additional heating due to inelastic electron scattering gives a correction @xmath24 .",
    "the existence of magnetic fields modifies @xmath2 from the above expression in three ways .",
    "firstly , the mass - loss rate is reduced by @xmath7 since only the open fraction of the pns surface contributes to the outflow . for times",
    "much less than time at which @xmath15 becomes equal to unity ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 is expected while it becomes smaller than unity at later times .",

    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33  s , using @xmath34 . secondly , @xmath2 is enhanced by @xmath35 due to the centrifugal force  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields and rotation are so strong and fast that the centrifugal force increases the scale height in the heating region , which can lead to @xmath36 .",
    "the third effect comes from the fact that electrons and positrons participating in the charged - particle reactions are restricted to discrete laundau levels , but this is negligible for @xmath37  g  @xcite . taking into account these effects of magnetic fields , we describe the baryon mass - loss rate by @xmath38  @xcite . in this work , we simply regard @xmath7 and @xmath35 as prefactors , since their evolution is uncertain . by setting @xmath8 in eq .  ( 1 ) , we find that the transition to relativistic flow ( @xmath39 ) occurs when @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the neutrino luminosity decreases gradually as a power law , until the pns becomes transparent to neutrinos at @xmath42  s  @xcite . for @xmath43 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath44 should decline rapidly . eventually , neutrino heating produces no mass loss , and instead @xmath2 is described by the goldreich - julian density : @xmath45  @xcite , where @xmath46 is the pair - multiplicity . in this late phase , we expect @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electron fraction",
    ". note that in this work we focus on low - entropy winds , as in the protomagnetar model of grbs  @xcite , that considers a poynting - dominated jet driven by a central rapidly rotating magnetar .",
    "hence , pairs loaded at the base of the flow are irrelevant at the neutrino production site until @xmath49 , unlike the fireball model of grbs .",
    "for the purpose of simple estimates , we hereafter assume @xmath50 , @xmath51  cm , @xmath52 , @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "then , the transition time @xmath54 , when the pns wind becomes relativistic ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined at 1  s. therefore , if magnetic fields are strong and/or rotation is rapid , the pns wind becomes relativistic at @xmath58 . if not , it will become so at @xmath59 as @xmath2 rapidly declines .",

    "we focus on the epoch @xmath66 , since the flux of relativistic neutrons producing quasithermal neutrinos decreases strongly for @xmath67 even though the wind becomes more relativistic .    at @xmath68 ,",
    "the pns wind is accelerated mainly magnetically .",

    "note that more efficient dissipation or radiative acceleration leads to indices larger than @xmath75 and smaller @xmath76 .",
    "hence , our results below are relatively conservative .",
    "the density in the initial cavity left by the ccsn shock is so small that a pns wind freely expands and easily sweeps through the cavity .",
    "as soon as the wind hits the high - density ccsn ejecta , it is forced to slow down to a speed of order of the ccsn shock velocity .",
    "then , a hot magnetized subsonic bubble forms and its evolution depends on @xmath15 and on the spin - down power of the pns .",
    "when the wind power is not high enough , a pns wind driven bubble , which terminates at the reverse shock caused by the interaction between the flow and shocked stellar material , would be quasispherical  @xcite .",
    "if the wind power exceeds @xmath77 , depending on progenitor properties , the anisotropic thermal pressure can redirect the equatorial wind  @xcite .",
    "then , the collimation happens at @xmath78  cm and bipolar flows are launched at a speed of @xmath79 , which may lead to grbs if the jets are successful in punching through the overlying progenitor star . in the jet case",
    ", additional baryon loading could occur around the jet - star boundary due to e.g. , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "although it can affect @xmath2 around the sheath region , our concept can still be applied .",
    "note that the baryon loading is not necessarily a decisive parameter to make successful jets . to see whether jets are finally successful and differentiate the fate of jet - driven explosions , parameters of the total jet power , jet duration , initial opening angle and density profile of progenitors are also important .",
    "we define the wind termination radius to be @xmath80 . in the case of a low - power quasispherical flow or a high - power biconical pair of jets ,",
    "@xmath80 is regarded as the radius of the reverse shock caused by the interaction between the flow and preshocked stellar material .",
    "when @xmath80 is smaller than @xmath81 , the final lorentz factor of the flow is @xmath82 the maximum lorentz factor ( @xmath15 ; eq .",
    "6 ) is achieved only if there is no boundary to the flow so that the wind radius reaches @xmath83 , as could be achieved in a high - power wind that launches successful jets  @xcite or if the acceleration happens more rapidly than assumed in eq .",

    "nuclei may be spalled , which is relevant at @xmath128 since shocked nuclei collide with neutrons  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "they can also be disintegrated by photons mainly via the giant - dipole resonance @xmath129 if @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the target photon energy in the stellar frame  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding threshold energy is @xmath132 .    the wind driven bubble ( or jet )",

    "relativistic neutrons should be decelerated via @xmath10 collisions , inevitably leading to neutrino production . if @xmath154 due to @xmath155 , the neutron beam propagate in the wind or jet , which can be damped in the shocked flow since the optical depth for the @xmath10 reaction is @xmath156 .",
    "note that , even if @xmath157 , their deceleration scale @xmath158 is longer than @xmath159 and any relevant plasma scales , so neutrino production is expected when ions are stopped by the reverse shock . at sufficiently late times , neutrons go through the flow , where they are damped in the stellar material ( with mass @xmath160 ) although the hadronic cooling of mesons and mesons can be relevant .",
    "although the duration of neutron emission is as short as @xmath59 , in principle , neutrons leaving the flow inside the stellar material can be depleted until the ccsn ejecta reaches the pionosphere at @xmath161 .",

    "the wind will be dominated by electron - positron pairs , though nuclei may be stripped from the surface .",
    "neutrons may be supplied by photodisintegration . however , as the target photon density is low , photodisintegration of thermal nuclei and quasithermal neutrino production are likely to become inefficient . on the other hand , possible nonthermal ions",

    "in addition , hk could also allow us to see @xmath1  mev neutrinos through the @xmath206 channel .",
    "however , detection of these lower energy neutrinos would be more difficult because of the smaller cross sections at lower energies and because the signal may be buried in the exponential tail of thermal mev neutrinos from the pns .    to see the signal , it is crucial to reduce backgrounds using space and time coincidence .",

    "in addition , radio observations may be useful for this purpose .",
    "although radio supernovae have been observed only for a fraction of ccsne and most of them seem to simply arise from the existence of dense circumstellar martial , some ccsne such as sn 1986j suggest possible activities of pulsars embedded in ccsn ejecta  @xcite .",
    "even though they are observed with much longer time scales compared to the duration of neutrino emission , future coincident observations would be useful .",

    "neutron - loaded relativistic winds emanate from rotating and magnetized pnss during their @xmath1  s cooling epoch . in this work ,",
    "we show that relativistic neutrons produce @xmath0  gev or even @xmath211  gev neutrinos via the @xmath10 reaction as the wind or jet interacts with the surrounding stellar material .",
    "such a role for neutrons in generating neutrino emission has been studied in the context of grbs . here , we have considered pnss in general , including quasispherical winds and choked jets .",
    "interestingly , the production of gev neutrinos , does not rely on uncertain cosmic - ray ion acceleration mechanisms that lead to nonthermal neutrinos , and instead relies primarily on magnetocentrifugal acceleration .",
    "we also pointed out that , however , even higher - energy neutrinos may be additionally produced via some particle acceleration mechanism .",
    "the shock acceleration mechanism is the most popular process , which is directly observed in data of solar winds  @xcite and widely accepted in the context of supernova remnants . since pns winds may still be magnetically dominated at the termination shock , it is not clear what is the most important process to generate nonthermal particles , and examples of particle acceleration mechanisms include not only the shock acceleration at the termination shock but also the magnetic reconnection and wakefield - like acceleration in the pns wind , which could generate ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays and result in pev - eev neutrinos via interactions with the stellar material and ccsn photons  @xcite . the physical conditions producing such nonthermal neutrinos , which may occur only at @xmath67 ( where @xmath192 ) , is completely different from the case considered in this work .",
    "effects related to neutrino propagation in the stellar material may be important .",

    ". the jet may interact with the preshocked envelope , and we have only @xmath215 at gev if @xmath216 at @xmath217  cm . studying neutrino oscillations in the mev - gev range would be much more interesting .",
    "for example , the matter effect is relevant since the resonance happens at @xmath218 , and we can use it to probe the density profile or check neutrino properties given the progenitor structure  ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although there appears to be a number of uncertain parameters governing the neutrino emission from the processes described in this work , the qualitative picture is simple .",

    "regarding @xmath219 , one sees that @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath220 are determined by the pns physics , and are relatively well - known from earlier theoretical work on pns winds and neutron star cooling , and from the neutrinos detected directly from sn 1987a .",
    "for this reason , the values will not differ largely from our fiducial values .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath7 and @xmath35 can be regarded as subparameters , and although their detailed time evolution is uncertain in the pns context , their physics is reasonably understood .",
    "the most relevant parameters are the physical parameters of the pns that determine the time - evolution of the pns wind magnetization and its power : @xmath5 and @xmath221 .",
    "these directly determine @xmath15 , which determines the lorentz factor of the neutrons , @xmath93 . throughout this work , we consider pnss , where @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "the similar discussion can be made in the case of black hole formation , given that @xmath44 is calculated for an accretion disk .",
    "our results are general as long as @xmath15 is high enough that the flow becomes relativistic at times before the pns becomes optically - thin to neutrinos @xmath62 ; for magnetar strength dipole fields and rotation periods less than @xmath222  ms this criterion is fulfilled .",
    "indeed , our results imply that for pnss with @xmath223  g and @xmath224  ms future neutrino telescopes such as pingu and hk may detect @xmath1 neutrino events of energy @xmath0  gev from the next magnetar - producing galactic ccsn .",
    "unfortunately , not all pnss are expected to be born with such high @xmath5 and short @xmath221 . as a reference value ,",
    "if we use the magnetar birth rate which is @xmath12% of the ccsn rate  @xcite , the chance of seeing a galactic event is very small .",
    "even so , nonmagnetars may also be detected thanks to particle acceleration and in principle even extragalactic ccsne may be detected if the wind is collimated , forming choked jets . in the latter case , we expect @xmath225 for the birth of magnetars within 5  mpc  @xcite . given the fact that the anb is reduced by detections that are reasonably coincident with follow - up observations at x - ray , optical , infrared , and radio bands , stacking analyses for nearby ccsne would be helpful .",
    "the detection of quasithermal neutrinos would strongly suggest the existence of relativistic neutron outflows , which can not be probed by photon observations .",
    "their detection is possible by next - generation neutrino telescopes such as pingu and hk , which should provide us with precious insights into magnetic acceleration mechanisms , the physics of pnss , and clues to nucleosynthesis . or , with good knowledge of @xmath219 , nondetections of gev neutrinos can potentially limit @xmath5 and @xmath221 via constraints on @xmath93",
    ". multi - wavelength studies at radio , optical and x - rays are also relevant to test our picture and constrain @xmath5 and @xmath221 by searching for long - term energy injection by pnss .",
    "rapidly - rotating and strongly - magnetized pnss have been proposed as the central engine of successful jets leading to grbs in compact stellar progenitors",
    ". a larger fraction of pnss would have less extreme @xmath5 and @xmath221 , leading to failed grbs , hypernovae and perhaps super - luminous supernovae .",
    "detecting the gev neutrinos would also be useful in revealing this ccsn - grb connection .",
    "very recently , the gton neutrino detector , icecube , reported the likely discovery of astrophysical high - energy neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the energy of neutrino - induced showers lies in the 30  tev-1  pev range . in the context of pnss ,",
    "as pointed out in this work , such high - energy neutrinos may be produced via some particle acceleration mechanism in the wind or around the termination shock .",
    "however , icecube is not sufficient for hunting much more guaranteed quasithermal neutrinos since it was built mainly for detecting neutrinos above tev energies .",
    "present water - cherenkov detectors such as sk seem too small to detect gev neutrinos from astrophysical sources .",
    "thus , we encourage having sufficiently large neutrino detectors that can fill the gap between mev and tev energies , which include deepcore and pingu as well as future mton neutrino detectors like hk .",
    "we thank john beacom , kumiko kotera , peter mszros , brian metzger , especially masayuki nakahata and carsten rott for helpful comments .",
    "we acknowledge support by the ccapp workshop , revealing deaths of massive stars with gev - tev neutrinos , and nasa through hubble fellowship , grant no .",
