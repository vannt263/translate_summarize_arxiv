    "recently the first truly two - dimensional ( 2d ) solid state material , graphene , was created in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects of this novel material is that long wavelength excitations are described by a dirac equation for massless particles , with a `` speed of light '' equal to the fermi velocity @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "thus one can study relativistic phenomena at very low velocities in an experiment far more accessible than a particle accelerator .",
    "the only real requirement to obtain this equation is the simple hexagonal , or honeycomb lattice structure of the graphene  @xcite .",
    "one can therefore consider any solid state system constructed on a honeycomb lattice , including artificial systems , in order to study relativistic phenomena in novel materials accessible in tabletop experiments .",
    "the most precise , cleanest , most controllable artificial solid state system is ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "such systems have no impurities and no disorder unless specifically added in by hand .",
    "they are very versatile : they can be constructed with an arbitrary lattice structure in one , two or three dimensions ; they can contain bosons and/or fermions , atoms and/or diatomic molecules ; and they can even have a pseudo - spin structure .",
    "their temperature and interaction sign , magnitude , and symmetry can be controlled externally . moreover ,",
    "2d physics has recently been of great interest in this context , in the form of the berzinskii - kosterlitz - thouless crossover  @xcite , and 2d systems underpinned by lattices are immediately available in experiments . instead of considering ultra - cold fermions , which could be used to produce an near - exact analog of graphene  @xcite , we consider ultra - cold bosons .",
    "bosonic statistics and interactions lead to a new feature in the massless dirac equation known in graphene  a naturally occurring nonlinear term , giving rise to a _ nonlinear dirac equation_.    the study of nonlinear phenomena in ultra - cold atoms , especially in bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , has been enormously fruitful . the recent text edited by kevrekidis , frantzeskakis , and carretero - gonzlez",
    "provides an excellent summary of this field  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear mean field description given by the nonlinear schrodinger equation ( nlse ) has been very accurate in the majority of experiments on becs .",
    "vector and non - local generalizations of the nlse have also proven useful  @xcite . in optical lattices ,",
    "the mean field description remains accurate provided the lasers creating the standing wave which is the optical lattice are not too intense , and the dimensionality of the system is greater than one  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we present a completely new class of nonlinear phenomena in becs , based on the nonlinear dirac equation ( nlde ) .",
    "nonlinear dirac equations have a long history in the literature , particularly in the context of particle and nuclear theory  @xcite , but also in applied mathematics and nonlinear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "as nonlinearity is a ubiquitous aspect of nature , it is natural to ask how nonlinearity might appear in a relativistic setting .",
    "however , this line of questioning has been strongly constrained by modeling , rather than first principles .",
    "that is , there is no standard first principle of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) which is nonlinear .",
    "so , the approach has been to require symmetry constraints in nonlinear models .",
    "one of these constraints is the principle of relativity , i.e. , poincar covariance .",
    "poincar symmetry includes rotations , translations , and lorentz boosts .",
    "in contrast , our nlde is not a model : it is derived from first principles for a weakly interacting bosonic gas in the presence of a honeycomb optical lattice .",
    "we show that poincar symmetry is naturally broken by the nonlinearity inherent in this system .",
    "given that this form of nonlinearity , which depends only on the local condensate density , is one of the most common throughout nature , it is important to recognize that the principle of relativity may be broken by small nonlinearities even at a fundamental level , for example of qed  @xcite .",
    "thus , we suggest a new direction of investigation in particle physics of possible nonlinearities as well as providing a natural context in artificial solid state systems for the nlde .    this article is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we provide a rigorous derivation of the nlde from first principles . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss both discrete and continuous symmetries common to relativistic systems , providing a clear physical interpretation in the present context .",
    "finally , in sec .",

    "a poincar transformation takes the spatiotemporal point defined by the the 4-vector @xmath120 into the point @xmath121 according to @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the coordinate matrix representation of the lorentz group and @xmath124 is a space - time translation .",
