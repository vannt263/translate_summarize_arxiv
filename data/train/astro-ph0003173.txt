    "@xmath0 carinae , situated in the carina complex at about 2.3kpc ( davidson & humphreys @xcite ) , is one of the most massive stars known in the galaxy and is going through the luminous blue variable phase ( humphreys & davidson @xcite ) of unsteady mass loss ( davidson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . during the 1840 s it underwent an outburst and reached visual magnitude -1 ; since then is has been emerging from the dust which condensed after this ejection ( walborn & liller , @xcite ) .",
    "long term monitoring of optical , ir , radio and x - ray spectra has revealed evidence of periodicity perhaps related to a binary or multiple star at the core of the nebula ( daminelli et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the compact nebula around @xmath0 carinae ( hd 93308 ) , called the homunculus , was first shown by thackeray ( @xcite ) to be highly polarized .",
    "the initial polarimetry was confirmed by wesselink ( @xcite ) who measured linear polarization of around 40% .",
    "visvanathan ( @xcite ) observed that the polarization centred on @xmath0 carinae was almost constant with wavelength from u to r and increased with increasing aperture size . in a small aperture ,",
    "higher polarization was observed on the nw side of the nebula than on the se .",
    "the first systematic polarization maps were made by warren - smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in the v band and demonstrated a centro - symmetric pattern of polarization vectors with a marked asymmetry in the polarization values along the major axis ( position angle @xmath6130@xmath5 ) with values upto 40% in the nw lobe .",
    "to produce such high values of polarization in a reflection nebula , mie scattering by silicate particles with a size distribution weighted to smaller particles was invoked and modelled by carty et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in the near ( @xmath70.5@xmath2 ) vicinity of @xmath0 car itself",
    ", speckle masking polarimetry in the h@xmath8 line and local continuum has revealed evidence for a compact equatorial disc aligned with the minor axis of the homunculus ( falcke et al .",
    "@xcite ) . within @xmath11@xmath2 of @xmath0 car",
    "the polarization vector pattern does not remain centrosymmetric in the r band , suggesting that local structures and perhaps intrinsic emission may contribute to the morphology and scattered light ( falcke et al .",
    "@xcite ) . polarimetry in the mid - infrared , where the dust emits rather than scatters radiation , shows an entirely different pattern of polarization vectors with a trend to be oriented radially , particularly near the boundary of the emission ( aitken et al .",
    "such a pattern can be interpreted in terms of emission from aligned grains ; aitken et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that the alignment mechanism may be gas - grain streaming , driven by the high outflow velocity , or a remnant magnetic field from a dense magnetized disc .",
    "there is a wealth of ir observations of @xmath0 car and the homunculus on account of its intrinsic ir brightness , first observed by westphal & neugebauer ( @xcite ) , and astrophysical interest .",
    "the ir spectrum is characterized by a peak around 10@xmath3 m , indicative of silicate grains ( mitchell & robinson , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a central ir point source together with a second peak on the minor axis of the nebula , whose separation increases from 1.1 to 2.2@xmath2 from 3.6 to 11.2@xmath3 m ( hyland et al .",
    "the near - ir spectrum of @xmath0 car shows a steep increase with wavelength and prominent hydrogen lines of the paschen and brackett series as well as he  i lines ( whitelock et al .",
    "@xcite ) and weaker fe  ii and [ fe  ii ] lines ( altamore et al .",
    "@xcite ) . maps in the j , h and k bands show that the structure is dominated by scattering , but beyond about 3@xmath3 m dust emission dominates ( allen @xcite ) , with many clumps present .",
    "high spatial resolution observations have reported an unresolved central source ( at l and m band , bensammar et al .",
    "@xcite ) , with filaments and unresolved knots within 1@xmath2 detected in many ir bands ( gehring @xcite ) . maps in the mid - ir show a similar structure and the compact central source has a dust temperature @xmath6650k and dust mass of 10@xmath9m@xmath10 with nearby dusty clouds associated into loop features ( smith et al .",
    "this source has been so prodigiously studied at so many wavelengths that it possesses its own review article in annual reviews of astronomy and astrophysics ( davidson & humphries @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0 car can be considered an ideal source for adaptive optics on account of its very bright central , almost point , source ( v@xmath67mag . - van genderen et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the limited radial extent ( @xmath1110@xmath2 ) of the homunculus , which means that the source itself can be used as a reference star for the wavefront sensor . as a consequence ,",
    "off - axis anisoplaniticity does not significantly affect the adaptive optics ( ao ) correction out to the edges of the nebula .",
    "previous near - infrared ao imaging of @xmath0 car was obtained ( rigaut & gehring @xcite ) , including some limited polarimetry ( gehring @xcite ) using the come - on ao instrument . here",
    "we report on dedicated high resolution near - ir ao imaging polarimetry conducted at j , h , k , and in a continuum band at 2.15@xmath3 m , using the adonis system and sharp  ii camera with the aim of studying the small - scale polarization structure of the homunculus .",
    "the observations are described in sect .",
    "2 ; the reductions and polarization data are presented in sect . 3 and the relevance of the results for the structure and dust properties of this remarkable reflection nebula are discussed in sect .",
    "imaging polarimetry of @xmath0 carinae was obtained with the adonis adaptive optics instrument mounted at the f/8.1 cassegrain focus of the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "adonis is the eso common - user adaptive optics instrument ; it employs a 64 element deformable mirror and wave - front sensor ( beuzit et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for the observations of @xmath0 car ,",
    "a reticon detector was used as the wave - front sensor .",
    "the camera is sharp  ii - a rockwell 256@xmath12 hgcdte nicmos 3 array ( hofmann et al .",
    "the pixel scale was chosen as 0.050@xmath13 , giving a field of view of 12.8@xmath1412.8@xmath2 .",
    "although this field does not encompass the full extent of the homunculus nebula it was chosen so that well - sampled diffraction limited imaging would be possible in at least the h and k bands .",
    "table 1 lists the observations ; the two orientations , referred to as a and b , had @xmath0 car in the lower right and upper left of the array respectively ( east is up ; north to the right ) enabling full coverage of the homunculus . the narrow band 2.15 @xmath3 m ( henceforth k@xmath4 ) observations were made with @xmath0 car in the centre of the array . for each filter and orientation , exposures were made at 8 position angles of the polarizer : 0.0 , 22.5 , 45.0 , 67.5 , 90.0 , 112.5 , 135.0 , 157.5@xmath5 in sequence .",
    "in addition a repeat of the 0@xmath5 exposure was made with the polarizer angle set to 180@xmath5 in order to check the photometry and repeatability of the polarimetric measurements .",
    "each full sequence of polarization measurements at the 8 + 1 position angles was repeated as specified in column 6 of table 1 .",
    "offset sky chopping was employed and the relative position of the offset sky is listed in column 5 of table 1 ; the exposure on sky was equal to the on - source time .",
    "as discussed in ageorges & walsh ( @xcite ) it was not possible to calculate reliable k band polarimetry ; these data will therefore only be discussed in terms of their high resolution imaging . on 1996 march 03 due to a technical problem ,",
    "the computer control of the chopper malfunctioned and the offset sky had to be observed subsequent to each sequence of polarizer angles , and in some cases the exposure time on source was greater than on background sky .",
    "the last column of table 1 gives an indication of the external seeing as measured by the differential image motion monitor at la silla during the observations .",
    "photometric standards were not observed and no attempt has been made to determine accurate magnitudes in the j , h , k and k@xmath4 filters .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     @xmath15 normalised to the observed value at 0.410@xmath3 m +    one way to attempt to visualize the extinction is to examine the wavelength variation of scattered light emerging at a position where there is an extinction feature .",
    "a position such as the pronounced drop in surface brightness at @xmath161.3@xmath2 on the morse et al .",
    "( @xcite ) cut ( fig .",
    "6 ) appears to be promising .",
    "the fractional depth of this feature was measured relative to the peaks by linearly interpolating between the values at @xmath160.5 and @xmath162.0@xmath2 .",
    "this is clearly dependent on the spatial resolution , especially when it comes to estimating the peaks which are much sharper than the extinction hole .",
    "the result is given in table 2 expressed in magnitudes ( i.e. a@xmath17 from the wfpc2 and adonis measurements ) .",
    "for comparison the expected extinction for a galactic law matched to a@xmath18 is listed in column 3 ( using the seaton ( @xcite ) extinction law as parametrized by howarth @xcite and r=3.1 ) . for",
    "the morse et al .",
    "( @xcite ) data , the f336w point appears anomalous ; it may be that the peaks also suffer extinction so the measurement of the extinction to the globule is underestimated . over the range 4100 - 10420  the extinction towards the nebula drops but less sharply than for the galactic extinction law .",
    "there is clearly a jump in values between the hst 1.042@xmath3 m and the adonis j band extinctions , probably on account of differing spatial resolution and psf s causing differing degrees of infilling .",
    "treating the measurements from j to k separately in table 2 shows that the extinction also drops less steeply than the galactic extinction curve , strengthening the suggestion of a flatter extinction law in this region of the homunculus .",
    "this somewhat greyer extinction favours particles larger than those typically found in the ism , in agreement with the conclusions of smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and others on dust emission .",
    "davidson et al . (",
    "@xcite ) also suggested grey extinction from a comparison of the modestly wavelength dependent brightening of @xmath0 carinae and the homunculus in the optical and near - ir .",
    "there is a strong discrepancy between the predictions of the extinction and emission of grains in the homunculus and their polarization properties .",
    "if the grains were typically 1 - 2@xmath3 m in the homunculus , mie theory for spherical particles predicts a maximum polarization at 1.65@xmath3 m of 38% for a scattering angle of 120@xmath5 ( assuming that the size distribution is flat from 1 - 2@xmath3 m and using the draine ( @xcite ) optical constants for silicate grains ) .",
    "however the v band polarization from mie theory is only 13% for such a size range of particles at the same scattering angle .",
    "whilst rayleigh scattering from very small @xmath190.1@xmath3 m grains produces a similar polarization at all wavelengths , it produces only a small variation in scattered flux with scattering angle ( by a factor @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus rayleigh scattering is not capable of matching the points as shown by the scattered intensity and polarization curves in fig .",
    "8 ( see caption for details ) .",
    "it has not so far been possible to find a single size distribution which would explain the consistent polarization value over a wide wavelength range and the similar variation in scattered flux with scattering angle from j - k ( see fig .",
    "to explain the consistency of the polarization , other suggestions involving a grain size distribution together with optical depth effects which ` tune ' the scattering properties with wavelength must be invoked .",
    "three possibilities are suggested to explain the dust scattering structure in the homunculus : + a ) the grains possess a range in size which is similar at all positions within the nebula but the extinction of this grain distribution at a given wavelength is such that the particles which contribute most to the scattering have lowest extinction . in other words when the extinction cross section is low , the scattering cross section is high .",
    "from mie theory this is not possible for a single grain species but could occur for some grain mixture .",
    "the extinction acts to fine tune the size range contributing to scattering .",
    "it is assumed here that the scattering angle changes rather little with wavelength ( hence extinction ) .",
    "for the polarization to stay constant with wavelength , there would need to be a grain size distribution inside small clumps .",
    "the unit optical depth scattering surface would then be deeper at longer wavelengths on account of the lower extinction .",
    "grain - gas or grain - grain collisions in the high velocity clouds could perhaps explain the size distribution which would affect the surface regions more strongly ; + b ) the effective scattering angle alters with wavelength on account of the differing extinction . to longer wavelengths",
    "the small dust globules become more transparent , resulting in an increase in scattering angle and a greater proportion of the scattered flux arises from towards the rearside of the lobes .",
    "this could compensate the increase of polarization with wavelength by providing less polarized flux . whilst this could work for the nw lobe it is not easily able to explain the polarization behaviour in the se lobe . here",
    "the scattering angle increases with increasing penetration ( lower line - of - sight extinction ) into the lobe and so the polarization should be expected to increase with increasing wavelength . in this case",
    "the relevant parameter is again the line of sight extinction but it affects the scattering angle ; + c ) the grains are aligned by the macroscopic velocity field of the homunculus such that it is their alignment that controls the polarization rather than the individual grains . a rather extreme alignment such as strings of dust particles would be required so it would be the incident radiation on a grain rather than its intrinsic scattering properties which would have a greater effect .",
    "given that there are highly collimated ejecta observed outside the homunculus ( weis & duschl @xcite and morse et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and that such features appear to extend inwards towards @xmath0 carinae , the suggestion of an influence of the macroscopic grain alignment on the scattered radiation may not be completely ruled out .",
    "suggestion ( c ) finds support in the detection of 12.5@xmath3 m polarization by aitken et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who first showed that there is organized grain alignment in the homunculus .",
    "the maximum values of 12.5@xmath3 m polarization were about 5% and the e - vectors are oriented mostly radially at the edges ( aitken et al .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "2 ) , although the pattern is complex .",
    "it is notable that the 12.5@xmath3 m polarization is largest in each lobe where the near - ir polarization is greatest - viz . at the ends of the lobes",
    "this suggests an intrinsic connection between the grains at the two wavelengths , rather than the polarization arising in different grain groups at the different wavelengths .",
    "aitken et al . (",
    "@xcite ) discuss radiation streaming as a mechanism to provide suprathermal grain spin of paramagnetic grains which then precess about the magnetic field direction .",
    "fields strengths upto milli - gauss were suggested and the field orientation in the lobes orthogonal to the major axis was favoured ( aitken et al .",
    "one possible scenario which could relate the presence of aligned grains and the constancy of optical - ir polarization with wavelength has the grains in the foreground lobes of the homunculus acting as the aligning medium for the scattered light from the rearside . by comparison with the case of galactic grain alignment , the amount of extinction to produce 30% polarization ( v band ) is e@xmath20 @xmath213.3 ( see e.g. whittet , @xcite , fig .",
    "this is a large extinction but not ruled out given the deduced extinction of a few magnitudes for the ` dark ' regions of the homunculus ( see table 2 ) .",
    "in addition the grains in the homunculus are probably very different from those in the general interstellar medium , having been recently ejected from a star with anomalous abundances .",
    "it is clear that grain alignment can not be wholly responsible for the constancy of the polarization with wavelength but may be a contributor . further observations to explore the polarization in the 3 - 5@xmath3 m region where there is a mixture of scattering and emission would be particularly valuable .",
    "the first high spatial resolution adaptive optics near - ir polarization maps of @xmath0 carinae and the homunculus nebula have been presented . since the homunculus is dominated by scattering",
    "then the appearance in the near - ir is rather similar to that observed in the optical and a comparison of the ao results with an hst 1.04@xmath3 m wfpc2 image was presented showing essentially the same features .",
    "the most important single result from this work is the overall similarity of the linear polarization from the v band to 2.2@xmath3 m within a few percent for the se lobe and the lower values at j and h compared with v for the nw lobe .",
    "image restoration was applied to a set of 2.15@xmath3 m continuum images to determine the polarization distribution in the near vicinity of @xmath0 carinae . a tentative value of the polarization of the weigelt et al .",
    "speckle knot d of 18% was determined suggesting that it is a dust cloud within the equatorial disc strongly illuminated by @xmath0 carinae .",
    "various models are discussed in order to explain the flat distribution of polarization with wavelength over the homunculus .",
    "a possible association of a narrow feature within the nw lobe of the homunculus with one of the highly collimated emission line ` whiskers ' outside the nebula deserves further investigation .",
