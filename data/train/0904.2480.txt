    "time - dependent correlation functions are a standard tool for quantifying the dynamics of physical systems.@xcite for the most basic analyses , knowledge of a single quantity  the relaxation time  and",
    "its dependence on external parameters such as temperature , is sufficient .",
    "but often more detailed information , in particular concerning the shape of the correlation function , is required .",
    "this might be , for example , because competing theoretical explanations make different predictions about the shape , for example . in the case of highly viscous glass - forming liquids@xcite some functions typically investigated include the autocorrelation functions of energy , pressure , shear - stress , and dielectric moment .",
    "these are related through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite to the corresponding dynamic response functions : frequency dependent specific - heat , bulk modulus , shear - modulus ( or equivalently viscosity ) and dielectric constant , respectively .",
    "the key features of viscous - liquid dynamics are ( 1 ) the non - arrhenius temperature dependence of the main , or alpha , relaxation time and ( 2 ) the non - exponentiality of the corresponding correlation functions .",
    "any theory of glass - forming liquids has to be able to explain these `` nons''violations of what is generally expected in relaxing systems ( arrhenius temperature dependence and exponential , or debye , relaxation ) .",
    "this paper presents a method for fitting relaxation data in the time domain , by parameterizing not the correlation itself but its associated memory function.@xcite the latter is a unique function related to the correlation function .",
    "the motivation comes from the hope that a relatively simple description of the memory function could be attained , and this hope turns out to be justified  very good fits can be achieved by taking the memory function to have the form of an inverse power law for non - zero times .",
    "moreover the exponent of the power law seems to have a common value , approaching at low temperatures a value around 1.6 for the 2d system and 1.5 for the 3d system , for the different correlation functions , something that is not true of the `` stretching parameter '' @xmath2 when fitting using a stretched exponential .",
    "in fact when the memory function parameterization is generalized to include an exponential cut - off , the exponent is temperature independent .",
    "in the next section we discuss some general ideas for describing relaxation and review the concept of the memory function associated with a correlation function .",
    "following that is a brief description of our simulations , while section  [ dataanalysis ] presents the details of our analysis method as applied to time - domain data from the simulations .",
    "results from the fitting procedure are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "section  [ discussion ] discusses possible ways of interpreting the power - law description .",
    "in this work we consider normalized correlation functions @xmath3 , typically ( but not exclusively ) defined in terms of a dynamical variable @xmath4 as    @xmath5    for example @xmath6 could be the potential energy , pressure , or shear stress . here",
    "@xmath7 indicates deviation from the thermal average .",
    "debye relaxation corresponds to a simple exponential decay with time constant @xmath8 :    @xmath9    there are many ways to define a relaxation time @xmath10 which agrees with @xmath8 in the case of debye relaxation . for our purposes",
    "the most convenient is the time integral of @xmath3 :    @xmath11    one advantage of this definition is that it uses all of the information contained in @xmath3 , unlike , for example , a definition based on the time at which @xmath3 attains a certain value .",
    "it is also convenient when working with laplace transforms , since this is simply the the @xmath12 value of the laplace transform of @xmath3 .",
    "the function most commonly used to fit time - domain data is the stretched exponential or kohlrausch - watt - williams ( kww)@xcite function ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 sets the time scale and @xmath15 is a number between 0 and 1 , known as the stretching parameter .",

    "fits to eq .",
    "( [ kww ] ) are often very good , but on the other hand experiments@xcite suggest that the relaxation crosses over to exponential at the longest times ( a decade or more beyond @xmath14 ) , corresponding to the last few percent of relaxation .",
    "this has not been investigated much , if at all , in simulations , probably because it is difficult to get high quality data at the longest times . in the case of single - particle diffusion , however , the crossover to exponential behavior should coincide with the onset of fickian diffusion and the convergence of the van hove correlation function to a gaussian , which have been studied by various authors.@xcite      the memory function concept was introduced by the work of zwanzig@xcite and mori,@xcite which provided a theoretical formalism for the calculation of correlation functions of many - body systems , based on projector - operator techniques .",
    "one of the historically most important uses for the memory function has been to elucidate the short - time structure of correlation functions .",
    "for example , pure exponential decay , represented by a delta - like memory function , is unphysical at short times , since the correlation , being even and smooth , should have zero slope at @xmath18 . replacing the delta function with a less singular function ( for example a step function , a gaussian , or an exponential )",
    "gives more physical short - time behavior . in this work",
    ", however , we are concerned with the long time behavior , and in our analysis will ignore the short time behavior , which is mainly associated with vibrational motion and irrelevant for structural relaxation .",
    "the memory function , @xmath19 , is defined@xcite for a normalized autocorrelation function @xmath3 by    @xmath20    the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath19 is completely invertible , which can be seen by considering the laplace transformation of this equation :    @xmath21    which implies    @xmath22    an invertible relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "( [ psi_s_k_s ] ) gives an expression for @xmath10 :    @xmath25    this will be useful below .",
    "although though of our analysis will involve a pure power - law decay of @xmath19 , it should be noted that if @xmath3 is known to decay exponentially at the longest times , the same must be true of the memory function : if @xmath3 decays as an exponentially @xmath26 at long times ( with @xmath27 is real and positive ) , this implies that the least negative singularity of @xmath28 is at @xmath29 .",

    "what happens when @xmath19 , which must be positive at time zero ( otherwise @xmath3 will diverge ) , becomes negative ?",
    "at that point @xmath49 starts to decrease , implying that the decay rate decreases .",
    "as long as @xmath50 , @xmath3 will exhibit slower - than - exponential relaxation  the instantaneous decay rate keeps decreasing .",
    "therefore we expect that for viscous liquids the memory function is negative and significant for times up to @xmath10 , around which time @xmath47 has more or less converged to the limiting value and exponential relaxation takes over .      when we consider simulation data we will be not interested in short - time vibrational contributions to @xmath3 or @xmath19 .",
    "a standard way of removing the effects of vibrations is to consider the so - called inherent dynamics,@xcite obtained by minimizing configurations along the actual simulated trajectory to the corresponding local minimum of the potential energy  the inherent state .",

    "this is not so surprising , given that the inherent trajectory is itself necessarily discontinuous , but it does pose problems for defining the short - time behavior of the memory function . to avoid these problems , and given",

    "we have simulated both two- and three - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) binary lennard - jones ( blj ) fluids . the parameters for the blj potential for both 2d and 3d are ( where l and s stand for large and small particles , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 the energy and length scales , respectively ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",

    "if one converts to physical units by assuming that the parameters for large particles are chosen to model argon ( i.e. , @xmath101 nm , @xmath102 kj / mol , @xmath103 u ) , then the time unit corresponds roughly to 2 ps .",
    "initial configurations consisted of fcc lattices with particles randomly assigned to be of type l or s such that the appropriate fraction was achieved .",
    "all simulations were at constant nve ; in particular the energy was controlled rather than the temperature @xmath43 , but we quote the temperature defined in terms of the mean kinetic energy per particle instead as it is more meaningful .",
    "starting at at @xmath104 ( where the liquid is not particularly viscous ) ten independent runs ( differing by the random placement of the particles on the initial lattice ) were made .",
    "the initial lattices melted immediately and equilibrated in the liquid state . for each state point , an equilibration run was carried out followed by a production run of the same length .",
    "equilibration was checked by examining the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath105 for the larger particles ; @xmath106 is 6.5 in 2d and 7.3 in 3d ( corresponding roughly to the peak of the structure factor for large particles ) .",
    "@xmath105 was required to be essentially the same for all ten runs , and the run - length to be of order 100 times the structural relaxation time ( @xmath107 ) .",

    ". then the particles velocities were randomized using a gaussian distribution with the appropriate width and then rescaling to give the exact desired kinetic energy . during the equilibration process",
    "it was checked that the new temperature ( mean kinetic energy ) was the desired one and velocities were rescaled if necessary ( generally a small change ) .      during the simulations ,",
    "collective quantities such as potential and kinetic energy and the different components of stress were computed and written at regular intervals ( typically every 100 or 500 time steps , though some shorter runs were made with more frequent output in order to determine the short time behavior of the correlation functions ) .",
    "configurations were saved at `` logarithmic intervals '' to allow calculation of @xmath108 for a broad range of times @xmath48 without writing configurations as frequently as the collective quantities ( which would require a huge amount of disk storage ) . because @xmath108 involves an average over particles , it has significantly smaller statistical error and therefore has low noise out to quite long times beyond the relaxation time",

    "[ shearcorrmem2d0.34 ] , is a disaster : after reasonable agreement up to @xmath115 , the transformed @xmath3 stops decaying and in fact begins to increase and eventually diverges .",

    "moreover the sum first becomes negative around where the inverted correlation function begins to increase  at this point",
    "the effective decay rate has become negative , and so the correlation function grows rather than decays .    clearly , direct fitting of the memory function is problematic .",
    "the fit which applies at least up to @xmath120 clearly is wrong for @xmath121 . because the noise in the exact memory function is so much larger than the true value",
    ", standard fitting procedures can not distinguish it from zero in this region .",
    "on the other hand , we can directly check that it is indeed significantly different from zero for quite long times : taking the exact memory function , but setting it to zero for times greater than @xmath122 , and inverting , we find the correlation function indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ shearcorrmem2d0.34 ] .",
    "after @xmath123 it drops below the true correlation function in a more or less exponential fashion , as expected when the memory function is only non - zero for a finite range of time .",
    "thus the apparent power - law behavior at short times must cross over to something more rapidly decaying , but still significantly different from zero .",
    "an approach other than direct fitting of the exact @xmath19 is clearly needed .",
    "since the noise in the correlation function is small compared to the function itself , comparing this to a trial function in a fitting procedure will not suffer the same problem .",
    "this suggests a practical method for determining the memory function : we choose a functional form which is quite flexible , containing many parameters . for",
    "any given set of parameter values we can generate the corresponding trial correlation function which can be compared in a least - squares sense to the actual correlation function .",
    "then we vary the parameters to optimize the match .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is fixed from the start to @xmath124 . given that the exact @xmath19 seems to have an initial inverse power - law decay for @xmath46 , we start with such a function . to provide flexibility",
    "we multiply by a piecewise linear function ; such a function will have discontinuous changes in slope but is simple and general  and hopefully the dominant behavior has been captured by the power - law factor .",

    "we noted a crossover from one apparent power - law to another at relatively short times , which allowed a simplification by considering data separated at times longer than the cross - over , namely the simple power - law form ( with possible exponential cut - off ) .",
    "in particular we chose @xmath153 in lennard - jones units for all of the analysis . while the fits are about as good as fits with a stretched exponential , the parameters obtained have arguably greater physical significance than those of the latter .",
    "in particular the exponent @xmath135 seems to be more or less independent of the relaxing quantity , and indeed of temperature ( as long as the exponential cut - off is included ) , which is not the case for the stretching parameter @xmath15 .",
    "moreover the parameter @xmath65 may be interpreted as a short time rate ; its temperature dependence is , interesting , significantly weaker than that of the alpha relaxation times for the different autocorrelation functions . as temperature decreases , the amplitude of the power tends to approach a limiting value associated with the mathematical description of anomalous diffusion / relaxation characterized mathematically by the mittag - leffler function .",
    "we hypothesize that this value is reached at finite temperature but the associated divergence of relaxation time is removed by the presence of an exponential cut - off . including the latter in the fits for the self - intermediate scattering function allowed the identification of a third time scale , longer than the alpha time .",
    "it is hypothesized that the strong non - arrhenius temperature dependence is due to a crossover from the time associated with the short - time rate to that associated with the long - time cut - off of the memory function , and that in particular at temperatures somewhat lower than those simulated , the non - arrhenius behavior will weaken noticeably .",
    "the centre for viscous liquid dynamics `` glass and time '' is sponsored by the danish national research foundation ( dnrf ) .",
    "here we describe in a little more detail how we optimize the fit .",
    "we start by describing the procedure using the general fitting form which includes the piecewise linear function @xmath127 .",
    "suppose first we have a correlation function based on inherent dynamics , so that there is no vibrational decay at short times , and in particular the @xmath18 value is known",
    ". then we may normalize by the latter to get the normalized autocorrelation function @xmath196 where @xmath197 @xmath73 is the integer corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "we write the fitting form as @xmath198 , where @xmath199 are the parameters of the fitting form .",
    "the node values @xmath129 are not used directly as parameters ; rather their logarithms are .",
    "this constrains them to be positive and minimizes numerical problems associated with the broad range of values that they turn out to have . for given values of the @xmath200",
    ", we can easily compute the associated correlation function @xmath201 and then the objective function        for the main data analysis we switched to using simpler functional forms without the piecewise linear function . also significant is that we used only the true dynamical correlation functions ( as opposed to those of the inherent dynamics ) which are more accurate and smooth ; this removed the need to do expensive minimizations . by considering times at intervals of order 20",
    ", we could avoid the vibrational decay , except that now the correct initial value of correlation function had to be treated as an unknown parameter . since this affects the normalization ,",
    "it is important to handle this carefully .",
    "suppose we have a non - normalized correlation function at discrete times , not including time zero : @xmath204 .",
    "since we are going to normalize anyway , we choose as the parameter not @xmath205 , but the ratio @xmath206 . and",
    "since this is required be greater than unity , it is represented internally ( i.e. , within the fitting algorithm ) in terms of a logarithm @xmath207 : @xmath208 , where @xmath207 is the actual parameter varied by the algorithm .",
    "note that @xmath141 is directly related to @xmath65 :      so that one may equivalently consider @xmath65 as the fitting parameter .",
    "an important technicality must be mentioned here .",
    "if the objective function is defined as above , there is a problem due to the fact that the normalization factor is now an adjustable parameter .",
    "this means that the objective function could be reduced by making @xmath141 , and hence @xmath205 , larger .",
    "this was found to be a problem for data sets from higher temperatures where the relaxation times were relatively short and therefore the data was not sufficient to constrain @xmath141 to reasonable values .",
    "the problem was solved by normalizing by the fixed quantity @xmath210 instead ( but only for the purposes of defining the objective function ) . for @xmath57 ( times greater than @xmath153 )",
    "we used in some cases the single power law of eq .",
    "[ power_law_km ] .",
    "the tail - weight fraction @xmath142 is constrained to lie between 0 and 1 by expressing it internally as the @xmath211 where @xmath212 is unconstrained .",
    "the exponent @xmath135 was represented as itself because it tended to vary within a relatively small range ( 1.52.2 ) , with no risk of assuming values which would cause numerical problems .",
    "in other cases an exponential cut - off factor was included , eq .",
    "[ exp_power_lawkm ] , which involves the timescale @xmath213 .",
    "because this can vary over several orders of magnitude , to aid convergence it was expressed internally in terms of its logarithm , @xmath214 , where the factor 10 was found to improve convergence ( presumably by making the typical values and range of @xmath215 comparable to those of other parameters ) ."
