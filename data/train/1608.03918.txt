    "the notion of lorentzian wormholes ( wh ) arose when morris and thorne explored the possibility of time travels for humans using the principles of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory of gr predicts that the structure and geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter is not rigid but it is elastic and deformable .",
    "the more compact the object is , the more strong the curvature of space is , which essentially leads to the idea of black holes .",
    "however in the later case , the fabric of spacetime loses its meaning at the curvature singularity .",
    "if somehow the formation of singularity is avoided then it would be possible to travel in and out of the horizon .",
    "the possibility of such a solution to the einstein field equations was explored for the first time by flamm @xcite soon after the formulation of gr , but it was later shown that his solution was unstable . a typical wormhole is a tube - like structure which is asymptotically flat from both sides . the radius of the wormhole throat could be constant or variable depending on its construction and it is termed static or non - static respectively .",
    "gr predicts that to form a wh , an exotic form of matter ( violating the energy conditions ) must be present near the throat of the wh .",
    "the problem is the dearth of reasonable sources sustaining the wormhole geometry .",
    "one possible candidate is the phantom energy ( which is a cosmic dynamical scalar field with negative kinetic energy in its lagrangian ) and it is one of the candidates for explaining cosmic accelerated expansion as well @xcite .",
    "since the existence of phantom energy is questionable and no other suitable exotic matter candidate is available at the moment , an alternative approach is commonly followed : investigation if the modifications of laws of gravity ( i.e. gr ) , proposed primarily for explanation of accelerated expansion and avoiding singularities , can support the wh geometries .",
    "since the wh is a non - vacuum solution of einstein field equations , the presence of some form of energy - matter is necessary to construct a wh . in the framework of modified gravity",
    ", the matter content is assumed to satisfy the energy conditions near the wh throat , while higher curvature correction terms in the lagrangian are required to sustain the wh geometry .    like @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is ricci scalar ) gravity which is based on a symmetric connection , the @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is torsion of spacetime ) gravity is based on a skew - symmetric connection @xcite .",
    "the latter theory is one of the many alternative ( or modified ) theories of gravity available in literature @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 theory is based on the tetrad formalism and the governing equations are derived by varying the gravitational lagrangian with respect to the tetrads . since the tetrad is not unique , hence the governing equations acquire different forms and hence different solutions in different tetrads ( see details in sec .",
    "ii ) . like any other theory ,",
    "@xmath2 theory have several drawbacks : it does not obey local lorentz invariance ; violates the first law of thermodynamics ; no unique governing field equations @xcite . despite these problems ,",
    "the theory efficiently describes the cosmic accelerated expansion and predicts the existence of new kinds of black holes and wormholes .",
    "it can also resolve the dark energy and dark matter conundrums @xcite .",
    "recently some attempts have been made to unify both @xmath0 and @xmath2 theories as @xmath4 gravity o by introducing a boundary term @xmath5 in @xmath6 gravity @xcite .    here , we want to study wormholes in a theory where torsion is non - minimally coupled with a scalar field and",
    "includes a matter action .",
    "it is important to note that similar models have also been studied in literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the noether symmetry approach @xcite and a wormhole metric ansatz to obtain the governing system of differential equations . after solving the equations ,",
    "we get the form of metric coefficients , symmetry generators , invariants and the form of torsion and potential functions .",
    "this approach has been extensively studied in literature @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we provide a brief review of generalized teleparallel gravity and sketch relevant notations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the model starting with the action of a non - minimally coupled scalar field with both torsion and the boundary term .",
    "we also derive the field equations and choose an ansatz for the wormhole metric . in sec .",
    "iv and its sub - sections , we construct a point - like lagrangian , search for noether symmetries and derive the wormhole solutions .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in what follows we will follow conventions outlined in  @xcite . here",
    "we present a brief review of the teleparallel formalism of gr .",
    "unlike gr , the dynamical variable in the teleparallel theory is the tetrad @xmath7 ( rather than the metric tensor ) , where greek and latin indices denote spacetime and tangent space indices respectively . here",
    "the metric tensor @xmath8 is related with the tetrads as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the minkowski metric tensor .",
    "the inverse tetrad @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the determinant of the tetrad @xmath14 , which can be evaluated from the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath15 .",
    "gr is based on the symmetric levi - civita connection , whereas , teleparallel gravity relies on the anti - symmetric weitzenbck connection @xmath16 defined as @xmath17 the anti - symmetric nature of connection leads to the concept of torsion in geometry .",
    "the torsion tensor is the antisymmetric part of the weitzenbck connection @xmath18 the tensor @xmath19 , referred as the torsion vector , is defined through the contraction of the torsion tensor , i.e. @xmath20 to construct the field equations of teleparallel gravity , we consider the following lagrangian density and vary it with respect to the tetrad @xmath21 where @xmath22 the torsion scalar @xmath3 is defined as @xmath23    furthermore , to express teleparallel gravity as an equivalent of gr , we write the levi - civita connection @xmath24 in terms of the weitzenbck connection as @xmath25 where here @xmath26 is called the contortion tensor and it is defined as @xmath27 this contortion tensor is antisymmetric in its last two indices . now expressing the ricci scalar of the levi - civita connection in terms of the weitzenbck connection ; using  ( [ levi ] ) , we get @xmath28",
    "as the difference between the ricci scalar and the torsion scalar is simply a total derivative , the action  ( [ taction ] ) gives rise to the same dynamics as the einstein hilbert action .",
    "this shows that teleparallel gravity is indeed equivalent to gr .",
    "defining the boundary quantity @xmath29 one then has simply the relation @xmath30 .",
    "note that one can write @xmath5 in terms of a levi - civita covariant derivative simply as @xmath31 .",

    "the latter theories have been widely studied in the literature from cosmology to astrophysical sources like wormholes .",
    "traversable wormholes supported by non - minimally coupled scalar field with the ricci scalar ( @xmath42 ) were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . they found that depending on the value of the coupling constant , one can construct different kind of wormholes .",
    "wormholes supported by a kink - like configuration of a scalar field was studied in @xcite . moreover , in @xcite , the authors studied the stability of electrically charged and neutral wormholes within this theory .",
    "+ additionally , canonical brans - dicke scalar tensory theory with @xmath44 can be recovered if we set @xmath45 with @xmath42 .",
    "wormholes configurations under this theory have been widely studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of bans - dicke wormholes is that they can satisfy the energy conditions . for the reader interested on cosmology on all these theories mentioned above , see refs  @xcite . in the context of teleparallel gravity ,",
    "wormhole solutions have also been studied ( see @xcite and their referees therein ) , but to the best of our knowledge , wormholes in teleparallel scalar - tensor theories ( for example with @xmath46 ) have not been considered yet until now .",
