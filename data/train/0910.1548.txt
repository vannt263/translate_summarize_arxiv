    "parton energy loss at rhic is widely viewed as a way to probe the properties of the medium created during the first few fm / c of the collision .",
    "the medium is suspected to be a strongly coupled liquid  @xcite with near perfect fluidity and strong energy loss .",
    "there have been a number of calculations involving parton collisional   and radiative   energy loss at rhic with the chief consequence of jet quenching @xcite .",
    "the measured jet quenching at rhic exceeds most current theoretical predictions , most of which are based on a weakly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( wqgp ) .",
    "the qcd matter probed numerically using lattice simulations and at rhic using heavy ion collisions , is likely to be dominated by temperatures in the few @xmath4 range making it de facto non - perturbative .",
    "non - perturbative methods are therefore welcome for analyzing the qcd matter conditions in this temperature range .",
    "an example being the holographic method as a tool for jet quenching analysis  .    in this letter",
    ", we follow the approach suggested in   to model the strongly coupled quark and gluon plasma , by classical colored constituents interacting via strong coulomb interactions .",
    "this model has been initially analyzed using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations mostly for the su(2 ) version with species of constituents ( gluons ) .",
    "the md results reveal a strongly coupled liquid at @xmath3 the ratio of the mean kinetic to coulomb energy ( modulo statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "the fractional energy loss is also found to be considerably larger than most leading order qcd estimates .    here , we will provide the analytical framework to analyze the md simulation results for partonic energy loss in the cqgp . in section 2",
    ", we outline a formal derivation of the energy loss in the cqgp for arbitrary values of @xmath2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we use linear response theory and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to tie the energy loss to the non - static colored structure factor . in section 4 , we derive explicitly the non - static structure factor using the liouville equation . some useful aspects of the plasmon excitations in the cqgp are discussed in section 5 . in section 6 , we analyze the energy loss for both charm and bottom for @xmath52,3 and 4 in the liquid phase and compare them to the recent su(2 ) md simulations . in section 7 , we discuss the relevance of our results to rhic and holographic qcd .",
    "consider an su(2 ) colored particle of charge @xmath6 travelling with velocity @xmath7 in the strongly coupled colored plasma  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of this _ extra _ particle in phase space follows from the poisson bracket    @xmath8    with the longitudinal colored electric field    @xmath9    we note that in  @xcite the su(2 ) plasma is considered mostly electric with massive constituents @xmath10 . as a result the transverse electric contribution is absent in  ( [ eq002p ] ) .",
    "also , ( [ eq001p ] ) does not involve the magnetic part of the lorentz force for the same reasons .",
    "the latter is irrelevant for the energy loss per travel length @xmath11    @xmath12    even in the ultrarelativistic case since the magnetic force does not perform work .",
    "the induced colored coulomb potential @xmath13 follows from the total colored potential @xmath14 through    @xmath15    the last relation defines the longitudinal dielectric constant with @xmath16 , the colored potential caused by the _ extra _ particle in the probe approximation ( ignoring back reaction ) .",

    "the only difference is in the su(2 ) debye wave number .",
    "to construc the longitudinal dielectric constant for the su(2 ) coulomb plasma we will make use of the liouville kinetic equations for the time dependent structure factors derived in  . for that we recall that in linear response , the induced color charge density @xmath40 ties with the external potential @xmath41 through the retarded correlator    @xmath42    where @xmath43 are the pertinent color charge densities . in fourier space",
    "we have    @xmath44    with    @xmath45    a comparison of ( [ lin2 ] ) with ( [ eq004p ] ) yields    @xmath46    which defines the longitudinal dielectric constant .",
    "the retarded correlator ( [ lin3 ] ) is in general a quantum object , we now show how to extract it from the correlations in the classical and strongly coupled su(2 ) colored coulomb plasma . for that , we note that the colored charge density in the su(2 ) phase space is    @xmath47    and that the su(2 ) charge - charge correlator is    @xmath48    where global time , space and color invariances were used thanks to the statistical averaging . the time dependent structure factor @xmath49 was defined in   . using the color legendre transform of @xmath50 yields    @xmath51",

    "we have shown in   that the l - color partial wave of the laplace transform of @xmath58 obeys the liouville equation    @xmath59    @xmath60 is the @xmath61 static structure factor introduced in     @xmath62    with the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath63 .",
    "the structure factor @xmath64 relates to the standard structure factor @xmath65 by the generalized ornstein - zernicke equations    @xmath66    the self - energy kernel @xmath67 in ( [ eq007e ] ) splits into a static and collisional contribution in each color partial wave @xmath61 .",
    "we note that    @xmath68    with @xmath0 is what is needed in ( [ lin5 ] ) . for that",
    ", we solve ( [ eq007e ] ) in the collisionless limit with    @xmath69    we recall that the su(2 ) color part of the liouville operator is a genuine 3-body force that only enters the collisional contribution .  . inserting ( [ lin7 ] ) into ( [ eq007e ] ) and using ( [ lin7 ] ) and ( [ lin8 ] ) yield in the collisionless limit    @xmath70    with    @xmath71    and    @xmath72    if we insert ( [ lin9 ] ) into ( [ lin5 ] ) and then use ( [ lin5x ] ) , we find for @xmath0    @xmath73    inserting ( [ lin11 ] ) into ( [ eq006p ] ) yields the announced relation ( [ lin12 ] ) .",
    "before analyzing the energy loss in ( [ lin12x ] ) for heavy charged probes , it is instructive to discuss the zeros of the longitudinal dielectric constant @xmath74 in ( [ lin12x ] ) as they reflect on the longitudinal excitations in the @xmath0 channel . for that , we need the behavior of @xmath75 as defined in ( [ lin13 ] ) with @xmath76 for small and large ratio @xmath77 .",

    "for @xmath82 or @xmath83 ,    @xmath84    while for @xmath85 or @xmath86    @xmath87    so in the long wavelength limit with @xmath82 , ( [ lin12x ] ) expands to    @xmath88    for small @xmath89 , @xmath90 whatever the coupling in the su(2 ) colored plasma .",
    "thus    @xmath91    with the plasmon frequency @xmath92 .",

    "this result agrees with our analytic and leading kinetic analysis in the hydrodynamical limit   .",
    "the current analysis provides the non - analytic imaginary part as well .",
    "the high @xmath85 limit is metallic whatever @xmath2 with    @xmath97    with a metallic conductivity @xmath98    @xmath99    we note that the plasmon branch disappears at high @xmath89 in ( [ lin17x ] ) as the plasma turns metallic i.e. a collection of free colored su(2 ) particles with a classical thermal spectrum .",
    "also the plasmon in ( [ lin16 ] ) broadens substantially at @xmath100 with its real part comparable to its imaginary part .",
    "this point causes the plasmon contribution to drop from the energy loss in the colored su(2 ) coulomb plasma as we show below .     versus @xmath101 for charm and bottom quark for fixed @xmath102 .",

    "we note that ( [ cb1 ] ) is cutoff in the infrared by the debye wave number since @xmath106 .",
    "so the main contribution to the energy loss in ( [ cb1 ] ) stems from the region @xmath107 for which the su(2 ) plasmon is too broad to contribute as we noted earlier .",
    "most of the loss stems from the metallic part of the su(2 ) plasma which is the analogue as rescattering against the _ free _ thermal spectrum explicit in ( [ meta ] ) .    in fig .",

    "we note again the 2 plasmon poles around @xmath110 at small @xmath102 .",
    "the vanishing of the termal distribution at @xmath111 follows from the extra @xmath112 weight arising from the denominator of ( [ cb1 ] ) for @xmath113 at large @xmath89 .",
    "since the loss is colored with only @xmath0 contributing and is metallic with only @xmath107 contributing , we do not see colored cherenkov radiation stemming from plasmon emission  , nor the ubiquitous mach cone stemming from coupling to the sound mode  @xcite .",
    "while the sound mode contributes to @xmath52 in ( [ charge2 ] ) it drops in the statistical averaging as only @xmath0 or plasmon channel contributes . the energy loss in the classical colored su(2 )",
    "coulomb plasma is mostly metallic with @xmath107 and soundless due to the color quantum numbers of the fast moving probe charge .",
    "a qualitative estimate for the energy loss follows by using @xmath114 and saturating the integrand by @xmath107 ,    @xmath115    the upper divergence is manifest in ( [ cb1 ] ) at @xmath85 since @xmath116 and @xmath117 through the generalized ornstein - zernicke equation for all coulomb couplings .",
    "the upper cutoff @xmath118 which is set by the maximum momentum transfer to the thermal particle of mass @xmath119 in the rest frame of the probe particle @xmath120 .",
    "typically @xmath121 is charm and bottom , while @xmath78 in weak coupling and @xmath79 in strong coupling for a qcd plasma near the critical point . for the former @xmath122 ( weak coupling ) while for the latter @xmath123 ( strong coupling ) .",
    "for @xmath124 ( [ cb2 ] ) reduces further to    @xmath125    for the su(2 ) colored coulomb plasma . aside from the casimirs ,",
    "this result is analogous to the energy loss in the classical and abelian coulomb plasma @xcite .    to assess the energy loss for varying coulomb coupling @xmath126 , we will rewrite the energy loss  ( [ cb1 ] ) as    .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]             @xmath127    where @xmath128 and @xmath33 is the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "the units for the energy loss per length in ( [ cb4 ] ) follows from @xmath129 . for su(2 ) , @xmath130 for a heavy quark , and @xmath131 for thermal constituent gluons of mass @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath133 for a density dominated by black - body ( gluon ) radiation @xmath134 .    in fig .",
    "[ charm_bottom1 ] we show the dimensionless energy loss following from ( [ cb4 ] ) for charm and bottom as a function of the probe momentum @xmath135 , for different @xmath136 around the su(2 ) liquid point .",

    "the loss is very sensitive to the coulomb coupling @xmath2 in the liquid phase .    in fig .",
    "[ charm_bottom_log ] we show the energy loss on a logarithmic momentum scale for both charm and bottom .",
    "the upper curve ( black ) is the total loss from ( [ cb4 ] ) , while the lower curve ( red ) is just the metallic loss following from ( [ cb3 ] ) .",

    "[ charm_bottom2 ] we compare our analytical results for the energy loss ( red curve ) to recent su(2 ) numerical simulations ( black curve ) using the same model  .",
    "we note that the numerical simulations in   are quoted for the mean - potential to kinetic energy ratio @xmath142 which happens to fluctuate by about @xmath143 inside the simulation box . to make the comparison meaningful",

    "our analytical results at @xmath139 compare favorably with the molecular dynamics simulations at large momenta and for heavier quark masses ( say bottom ) .",
    "most of the discrepancy with the simulations is at low momentum where the effects of the hard core in   are the largest .",
    "we have analyzed the energy loss of fast moving charm and bottom quarks in an su(2 ) color coulomb plasma for a broad range of the coulomb coupling .",

    "we have shown that the probe initial color and statistical averaging causes the longitudinal dielectric function to select the @xmath0 color channel of the time - dependent structure factor which is the plasmon channel .",
    "the sound channel dominates the low momentum of the @xmath148 color channel , and decouples from the longitudinal part of the dielectric function .",
    "while the su(2 ) plasmon survives at strong coupling , its width for @xmath107 is substantial and therefore causes it to thermally decay .",
    "the energy loss of fast moving charm and bottom quarks is mostly due to the metallic aspect of the su(2 ) colored coulomb plasma which is dominated by thermal particles .",
    "there is no colored cerenkov cone as the plasmon is dwarfed in the metallic limit , nor a colorless mach cone as the sound decouples due to the probe initial colors .",
    "the energy loss is soundless .",
    "our results are of course only classical .",
    "they apply for a broad range of @xmath2 near the liquid point .",
    "the comparison to the md simulations show that our energy loss is about comparable at higher momenta and for heavier quarks where the effects of the numerical hard core is small . as initially reported in",
    ", the energy loss is sizable .",
    "strong coupling assessment of jet energy loss in gauge theories have been carried out in the context of holographic qcd  @xcite .",
    "the fact that a mach cone was reported in these calculations  , maybe due to the fact that the probe jet is actually colorless .",
    "indeed , most of the holographic jets are inserted with an external hand that maintains a constant velocity and perhaps even balance the color charge .",
    "clearly colorless ( mesonic ) jets of the type @xmath149 do couple to the sound channel in our case through the @xmath150 structure factor  , and are expected to be trailed by a mach cone .    finally , to carry our analysis of charm and bottom at rhic and",
    "perhaps even lhc , require an assessment of the heavy quark composition in the prompt phase of the heavy ion collision which we have not carried out .",
