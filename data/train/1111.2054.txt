    "it has also been pointed out @xcite that the required zeeman splitting in 1d can be induced by a magnetic field parallel to the adjacent superconductor ( thus avoiding the problem of orbital effects @xcite ) , and the non - abelian character of the end majorana modes can be probed by josephson experiments .",
    "very recently it has been shown that the generic luttinger hamiltonian applicable to the _ hole - doped _ nanowires also supports end majorana modes @xcite in a manner similar to its electron - doped counterpart .",

    ", it may be useful to provide a qualitative discussion and a general perspective on the issue of optimal materials for the realization of the predicted ts phase and majorana modes in semiconductor - superconductor sandwich structures .",
    "the first point to emphasize is that there are far too many independent physical parameters entering the problem for theory to be particularly useful in this context .",
    "at least six independent material parameters play a role here : @xmath11 , @xmath22 , @xmath9 , @xmath28 , @xmath19 , @xmath113 ( which determines @xmath55 in eq .",
    "[ lambda ] ) .",
    "in addition , disorder , which plays a crucial role by the non - existence of anderson s theorem in the time - reversal invariance broken ( i.e. @xmath203 ) situation , is itself characterized by several independent physical mechanisms : disorder in the adjacent bulk superconductor , long - ranged disorder in the semiconductor , disorder - induced fluctuations in @xmath113 , interface disorder , puddles , and so on . a physical system characterized by such a large ( @xmath204 10 ) set of independent parameters , all of which are important in determining the fate of the ts state , is not an easy optimization problem to deal with theoretically . in particular",
    ", it may turn out to be more practical to simply carry out experiments on available systems ( e.g. inas or insb on al or nb ) than to trust precise theoretical quantitative predictions with respect to the optimal materials choice .    with these important caveats in mind , we can",
    ", nonetheless , make some general qualitative statements , quite apart from the more precise quantitative statements made in the main body of this work . in the clean case , where disorder is not an issue ( i.e. extreme high - mobility semiconductor systems ) , it is obvious that the semiconductor spin - orbit coupling should be as large as possible .",
    "this continues to be the case even in the presence of disorder , making @xmath205 to be the key physical parameter , which should be made as large as possible ( including enhancement by external gates if feasible  @xcite ) with no constraints .",
    "similarly , disorder is always harmful to the ts state , and therefore @xmath24 should be made as small as possible by working with the highest mobility materials .",
    "although having a spin - orbit coupling strength as large as possible is obviously helpful to the realization of the ts phase , this may have the detrimental effect of enhancing impurity - induced scattering between the spin - split bands , thus reducing the mobility , @xcite and therefore some optimization may be necessary even with respect to spin - orbit coupling and mobility in order to satisfy the general requirement of having both the highest possible spin - orbit coupling and mobility .",
    "the same is to a limited degree true of the superconducting gap @xmath19 ( or equivalently @xmath206 ) in the bulk supercnoductor , but this advantage is considerably nullified by the fact that the proximity effect is determined primarily by the parameter @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "[ delta0 ] ) , and this parameter should be made as large as possible , even at the cost of having a lower @xmath19 in the bulk superconductor ( e.g. al may be preferable over nb if @xmath207 ) .",
    "we note that having an arbitrarily large proximity gap @xmath21 in the semiconductor may not necessarily help unless @xmath164 can also be simultaneously increased ( e.g. by an external gate ) since @xmath208 is a necessary condition for the existence of the ts phase .",
    "similarly , having a very small @xmath9 does not help since @xmath209 determines the condition for a robust topological phase , and having a small @xmath9 necessarily requires having a much smaller @xmath3 , which severely restricts the temperature range where the experiments investigating the topological phase can occur since @xmath210 is necessary .",
    "for the same reason a small @xmath164 , e.g. gaas , with correspondingly smaller @xmath9 and @xmath3 would not work either since the operational temperature would then be too small .",
    "as for disorder , our discussion in this work has considered the semiconductor disorder to be short - ranged , which is consistent with interface disorder ( or roughness ) scattering which is known to be important in semiconductor nanowires .",
    "carrier screening should render long - range coulomb disorder arising from random charged impurities in the semiconductor into effective short - ranged disorder , making our model of rather general validity .",
    "the fact that we model disorder through an effective relaxation time @xmath78 defined through the measured carrier mobility makes the model robust with respect to different types of disorder in the semiconductor , but we note that for long - ranged coulomb disorder @xmath177 is really only a lower bound on the effective disorder .",
    "( disorder arising from impurities in the superconductor does not affect the ts phase at all , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . )    a simple dimensional argument , which has been authenticated by a renormalization group calculation , @xcite suggests @xmath211 , i.e. @xmath212 , as the bound on the effective scattering rate for the topological gap @xmath3 to survive disorder in a spinless chiral p - wave superconductor characterized only by these two parameters ( unlike our problem which is characterized by many physical parameters ) .",
    "we note that our microscopic born approximation calculation ( eq .  [ taut ] ) is consistent with this case deep in the ts phase for @xmath213 . for @xmath214 , the effect of disorder scattering",
    "is suppressed so that the topological gap survives disorder for a broader range of parameters @xmath215 .",
    "unfortunately for the semiconductor - superconductor sandwich structures of interest to us , @xmath215 only provides a necessary condition since @xmath3 can not be made arbitrarily large unless @xmath164 i.e. the spin - orbit coupling is itself arbitrarily large .",
    "the sufficient conditions for the gapped topological state to exist in the semiconductor sandwich structures are given by eqs .",
    "33 , 34 , which require  large \" @xmath9 making it necessary to have even larger @xmath164 !",
    "thus , the existence of the ts phase in the realistic semiconductor sandwich structures depends on the seamless and multiparameter materials optimization of spin - orbit coupling , spin splitting , superconducting gap , and disorder in an inter - dependent manner .",
    "we conclude with the observation that the single most important ingredient for the ts state to emerge in semiconductor - superconductor sandwich structures is to have a large spin - orbit coupling and high mobility . for electrons both inas and insb satisfy the necessary requirements if the mobility can be enhanced around @xmath216 @xmath14/v - s . for holes the spin orbit coupling being very large , much lower mobilities ( @xmath217 @xmath14/v - s ) should work .",
    "these considerations imply that holes should be looked into experimentally for the realization of the ts phase .",
    "in addition , having several ( odd number of ) subbands @xcite occupied in the nanowire should help since it reduces disorder through screening and enhances the effective values of @xmath164 .",
    "we emphasize that the existence of the ts state depends delicately on the competition among superconducting proximity effect , spin - orbit coupling , spin splitting , and chemical potential .",
    "( disorder scattering always suppresses the ts state . ) as such , any materials optimization must carefully choose among these physical parameters while at the same time maintaining the highest possible mobility ( i.e. smallest possible disorder scattering ) .",
