    "much has been learned about the internal structure of the nucleon from inclusive deep - inelastic lepton scattering since the first such experiments were carried out at slac in the late 1960s . these and many subsequent dis experiments [ 1 ] were instrumental to the development of the quark - parton model of hadrons .",
    "successful as it has been in describing much of the dis data in the perturbative region , a quark - parton based picture of the nucleon is not entirely complete  it is unable to explain the non - perturbative structure of the nucleon .",
    "a very good example of this is the deviation from the parton model prediction for the gottfried sum rule seen in the recent nmc experiment [ 2 ] .",
    "the most natural explanation of this result is that there exists an excess of @xmath1 quarks over @xmath2 in the proton , something which is clearly impossible to obtain from perturbative qcd alone . a non - perturbative pionic cloud in the nucleon on the other hand offers a simple explanation of su(2 ) flavor symmetry breaking in the proton sea [ 3 ] .",
    "the pion content of the nucleon has been investigated in previous studies of inclusive dis [ 4 ] , although only upper bounds on the average pion number were able to be extracted .",
    "in addition , since the pion contribution to the nucleon structure function appears at relatively small bjorken @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , its signal is lost amongst the perturbative sea background .",
    "it is therefore a challenge to seek direct experimental confirmation of pionic effects in inclusive nucleon dis .",
    "the pertinent question is whether pions leave any unique traces in other processes which can not be understood in terms of quarks and gluons alone .",
    "a possible candidate for this is semi - inclusive dis , where a hadron is detected in the final state in coincidence with the scattered electron .",
    "we shall demonstrate that pions give rise to characteristic fragmentation distributions in comparison with the predictions of parton model hadronization .",
    "these differences are significantly enhanced when polarization degrees of freedom are considered .",
    "we focus on semi - inclusive polarized @xmath0 electroproduction from a polarized proton , @xmath5 .",
    "( the decay products of @xmath6 or @xmath7 include neutrals whose detection would be more difficult . )    because the @xmath8 structure function of a pion is zero , an unpolarized electron beam will suffice for this purpose .",
    "the produced @xmath9 s will appear predominantly in the target fragmentation region , or backward hemisphere in the @xmath10 c.m .",
    "frame , and hence will appear slow in the laboratory frame . with the high luminosity beam available at cebaf the rate of @xmath0 production will generally be high . even though the efficiency with which low momentum @xmath9ss can be accurately identified is lower than for fast baryons produced in the forward @xmath10 c.m .",
    "hemisphere , their detection may still be feasible with the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer .",
    "we define our variables in the laboratory frame as follows : @xmath11 are the momentum four - vectors of the initial and final electrons , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 are the momentum vectors of the target proton and recoil @xmath9 , respectively , and @xmath16 denotes the photon 4-momentum , defined to lie along the positive @xmath17-axis .",
    "then @xmath18 is the energy transferred to the target , @xmath19 is the fractional energy transfer relative to the incident energy , and @xmath20  is minus the four - momentum squared of the virtual photon , with @xmath21 . with the cebaf upgrade to @xmath22 gev , values of @xmath23 can be reached in the deep inelastic region for @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 gev@xmath26 .",
    "the four - momentum transfer squared between the proton and @xmath9 is @xmath27,which is bounded from above by @xmath28 , where @xmath29  is the light - cone fraction of the target proton s momentum carried by the @xmath9 . in terms of @xmath30 , the three - momentum of the produced @xmath9",
    "is given by @xmath31 so that in the lab .",
    "frame the slowest @xmath9 s are those for which @xmath32 , which occurs when @xmath33 . as the upper limit on @xmath34 is @xmath35 , slow @xmath9 production also corresponds to the @xmath36 limit , and the slowest possible particles produced at @xmath37 ( at @xmath38 ) have momentum @xmath39 mev . for the pion - exchange process considered here , the peak in the differential cross section occurs at @xmath40 mev .",
    "this corresponds to a total c.m .",
    "energy squared of the photon ",
    "proton system of @xmath41 gev@xmath26 , and a missing mass of @xmath42 gev@xmath26 .    in terms of the laboratory angle @xmath43 between the @xmath9 and @xmath44 directions , where @xmath45 production of @xmath9 s will occur between @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath33 .",
    "for studies of the spin dependence of the fragmentation process , we require the target proton polarization to be parallel to the photon direction , with the spin of the produced @xmath9 quantized along its direction of motion .",
    "experimentally , the polarization of the produced @xmath48 can be reconstructed from the angular distribution of its decay products ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the relevant process is illustrated in fig.1 , where the dissociation of a physical proton into a @xmath51 and @xmath0 is explicitly witnessed by the probing photon . in the pion - exchange model",
    "the differential cross section is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the lepton tensor , and @xmath54 describes the @xmath55 vertex . the pion structure function is extracted from drell - yan experiments [ 5 ] .    for the @xmath56 form factor in eq.([ope5 ] ) we take the form suggested in ref.[6 ] in an analysis of the pionic content of the proton in the infinite momentum frame , @xmath57 where @xmath58 . as discussed in ref.[6 ] , the formulation in the infinite momentum frame allows the use of the experimental structure function of the pion in eq.([wpi ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath59 is obtained by evaluating the trace over the target nucleon spinor and the rarita - schwinger spinor - vector for the recoil @xmath9 . because it is emitted collinearly with the pion , production of @xmath9 baryons with spin projection @xmath60 is forbidden , which leads to the selection rule : @xmath61 the yield of spin projection @xmath62  states is given by @xmath63\\      \\left [ ( m + m_{\\delta})^2 - t \\right]^2\\      ( 1 \\pm \\cos\\alpha)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is also the angle between the polarization vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 . because the production of @xmath9 baryons is limited to forward laboratory angles , the presence of the @xmath66 factor associated with the final state polarization will significantly suppress the @xmath67 yield relative to that of @xmath68 final states .",
    "this suppression leads to strikingly different predictions for the polarization asymmetry compared with those of the competing parton fragmentation process discussed below .",
    "at the large @xmath69 and @xmath70 possible with an 810 gev electron beam , the resonance backgrounds should not pose a major problem in identifying the required signal .",
    "firstly , interference from quasi - elastic @xmath0 production will not be present because of charge conservation .",
    "secondly , the large @xmath71 gev ) involved means that interference from excited @xmath72 states ( with subsequent decay to @xmath0 and pions ) will be negligible .",
    "in addition , any such resonance contributions will be strongly suppressed by electromagnetic form factors at large @xmath69 ( @xmath73 gev@xmath26 )",
    ".    a potentially more important background will be that due to uncorrelated spectator fragmentation . within the parton model framework the cross section for this process ( assuming factorization of the @xmath3 and @xmath34 dependence ) is proportional to [ 7 ] @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the light - cone momentum fraction of the produced baryon carried by the spectator system .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath76 gives the probability for the polarized ( @xmath77 minus @xmath78 ) spectator system to fragment into a @xmath0 with polarization @xmath65 .",
    "the usual assumption is that the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath9 also factorizes,@xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "the function @xmath81 is proportional to the spin - weighted interacting - quark momentum distribution functions , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 denote quark spins parallel or antiparallel to the spin of the proton . for estimation purposes we consider the model for @xmath82 of carlitz & kaur [ 8 ] .",
    "the results change little if one uses the model of schfer [ 9 ] .    at large @xmath17 the fragment @xmath0 carries most of the parent system s momentum , and therefore contains both valence @xmath84 quarks from the target proton . in our region of interest ( @xmath85 ) by far the most important contributions to @xmath86",
    "come from the process whereby the @xmath0 is formed after only one @xmath87 pair is created [ 10 ] . as a consequence dis from valence",
    "@xmath84 quarks will be unimportant . for scattering from sea quarks",
    "we assume the same fragmentation probabilities for @xmath88 spectator states as for @xmath89 ( although at @xmath90 gev@xmath26 the sea constitutes at most @xmath91 of the cross section at @xmath4 ) .",
    "we thus parametrize the ( very limited ) emc data [ 11 ] on unpolarized @xmath0 muon production for @xmath92 as : @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    for the spin dependence of the fragmentation process we follow the approach taken by bartl et al .",
    "[ 12 ] in their study of polarized quark @xmath96 baryon fragmentation .",
    "namely , the diquark is assumed to retain its helicity during its decay , and the @xmath97 pair creation probability is independent of the helicity state of the quark @xmath98 . at leading order",
    "this means that the produced baryon contains the helicity of the diquark , so that , for example , a @xmath99 or @xmath100 can emerge from a @xmath101 diquark , whereas a @xmath102 can not .",
    "( notation here is that @xmath103 represent @xmath104 states , respectively . )",
    "the overall normalization of the spin - dependent fragmentation functions is fixed by the condition @xmath105 where @xmath106 . in relating the production rates for various polarized @xmath0 we employ su(6 ) spin - flavor wavefunctions ,",
    "from which simple relations among the valence diquark @xmath96 @xmath0 fragmentation functions , @xmath107 , can be deduced ( the diquark state @xmath108 is labeled by its spin @xmath109 and spin projection @xmath110 ) .",
    "the leading functions are related by : @xmath111 with normalization determined from : @xmath112 ( note that this is true only when the spin projections of the diquark and @xmath9 are in the same direction . )",
    "the non - leading fragmentation functions are those which require at least two @xmath97 pairs to be created from the vacuum , namely @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , and those which require 3 such pairs , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . except at very small @xmath17 ( @xmath120 )",
    "the latter functions are consistent with zero [ 10 ] . for the 2-@xmath97 pair fragmentation functions",
    ", we also expect that @xmath121 . for @xmath122",
    "the unpolarized model fragmentation functions of ref.[10 ] requiring two @xmath97 pairs ( e.g. @xmath123 ) are quite small compared with the leading fragmentation functions , @xmath124 . for spin - dependent fragmentation",
    "we therefore expect a similar behavior for those decay probabilities requiring two @xmath97 pairs created in order to form the final state with the correct spin and flavor quantum numbers .",
    "this then allows for a complete description of polarized fragmentation at large @xmath17 in terms of only the 4 fragmentation functions in eq.([leadff ] ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath125-integrated differential cross section for the electroproduction of a @xmath0 with spin @xmath65 can be written : @xmath126 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the differential cross section , @xmath127 , for the individual polarization states of the produced @xmath0 ( for dis from a proton with @xmath128 ) is shown in fig.2 , for @xmath129 , @xmath130 gev@xmath26 and @xmath131 gev .",
    "the pion - exchange model predictions ( solid curves ) are for a form factor cut - off of @xmath132 mev , which gives @xmath133 @xmath134 [ 6 ] .",
    "( for the same @xmath133 the cut - off in a @xmath30-dependent dipole form factor would be @xmath135 mev . )",
    "the spectrum shows strong correlations between the polarizations of the target proton and @xmath0 . in the quark - parton model ( dashed curves )",
    "the correlations are significantly weaker , and the ratio of polarized @xmath9 s in this case is @xmath136 .",
    "the differences between the pion - exchange model and fragmentation backgrounds can be further enhanced by examining polarization asymmetries .",
    "in fig.3 we show the difference @xmath137 , where @xmath138 , as a fraction of the total unpolarized cross section .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 distributions are almost flat , but significantly different for the two models",
    ".    of course the two curves in fig.3 represent extreme cases , in which @xmath9 s are produced entirely via pion emission or diquark fragmentation . in reality",
    "we can expect a ratio of polarization cross sections which is some average of the curves in fig.3 .",
    "the amount of deviation from the parton model curve will indicate the extent to which the pion - exchange process contributes . from this , one can in turn deduce the strength of the @xmath56 form factor .",
    "unlike inclusive dis , which can only be used to place upper bounds on the pion number , the semi - inclusive measurements could pin down the absolute value of @xmath133 .",
    "a measurement of this ratio would thus be particularly useful in testing the relevance of non - perturbative degrees of freedom in high energy dis processes .",
