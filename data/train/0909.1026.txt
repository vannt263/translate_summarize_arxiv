    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the tibet iii air shower array experiment has been conducted at yangbajing ( 90.522@xmath1e , 30.102@xmath1n ; 4300 m above sea level ) in tibet , china .",
    "the array composed of 533 scintillation counters of 0.5 m@xmath2 each covers a detection area of 22,050 m@xmath2 achieving a trigger rate of @xmath0680 hz .",
    "gcr events are selected for analyses , if all the following criteria are met : ( i ) any four - fold coincidence occurs in the counters with each recording more than 0.8 particles in charge , ( ii ) the air shower core position is located in the array , ( iii ) the zenith angle of arrival direction is @xmath3 . with all these criteria , the array has the modal gcr energy of @xmath05 tev .",
    "the angular resolution of the arrival direction of each shower is estimated to be @xmath00.9@xmath1 from monte carlo simulations , and this was also verified by measuring the moon s shadow in gcrs @xcite . in this paper , we analyze a total of 37 billion air shower events recorded in 1318.9 live days from november 1999 to october 2005 .",
    "1(a ) shows the observed gcr intensity in @xmath4 pixels in a color - coded format as a function of the right ascension ( @xmath5 ) on the horizontal axis and the declination ( @xmath6 ) on the vertical axis . for producing this figure ,",
    "we first obtain the gcr intensity @xmath7 in @xmath8-th right ascension and @xmath9-th declination pixel .",
    "we then normalize the average of @xmath7 in each declination belt to unity and get the normalized model intensity @xmath10 plotted in this figure .",
    "this sky - map covers 360@xmath1 of @xmath5 but covers only 90@xmath1 of @xmath6 ranging from -15@xmath1 to + 75@xmath1 due to the event selection criterion limiting zenith angles to @xmath3 .",
    "the map clearly shows a significant anisotropy , consisting of a @xmath00.2 % excess at @xmath11 and @xmath12 and a @xmath00.2 % deficit at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , each observed with a statistical significance more than ten times the statistical error .",
    "there is also the  skewed \" feature seen in the region of excess intensity as pointed by @xcite . in the next section , we develop a model anisotropy reproducing this observed global feature as well as the  skewed \" feature .",
    "we develop a model anisotropy @xmath15 consisting of two components as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively denote the global anisotropy ( ga ) and the additional excess ( ae ) intensity as described below .",
    "we first normalize the average of @xmath15 in each declination belt to unity and get the normalized model intensity @xmath19 , the same way as we did for the observed data to produce fig .",
    "1(a ) . by comparing @xmath20 with @xmath10 in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we obtain best - fit parameters minimizing the residual @xmath21 defined , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the statistical error of the intensity in @xmath24 pixel . from this",
    "best - fitting , we excluded 16 pixels containing the known and possible gamma ray sources",
    ". these pixels also include the  region a \" reported by milagro experiment @xcite .    the observed angular separation between the excess and the deficit in fig .",
    "1(a ) is only @xmath25 , which is much smaller than 180@xmath1 expected from a uni - directional flow ( udf ) but significantly larger than 90@xmath1 expected from a bi - directional flow ( bdf ) .",
    "only a combination of the uni - directional and bi - directional flows can achieve a reasonable fit to the global feature of the observed anisotropy . from this point of view",
    ", we perform a best - fit calculation to the observed global anisotropy ( ga ) with a model intensity @xmath17 expressed , as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are amplitudes of udfs perpendicular and parallel to the bdf , respectively , @xmath29 is the amplitude of the bdf , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively right ascensions and declinations of the reference axes of the perpendicular udf and bdf and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the angle of the center of ( @xmath34 ) pixel measured from the reference axis of the perpendicular udf ( bdf ) @xcite .",
    "1(b ) displays @xmath35 derived from best - fitting to fig .",
    "1(a ) . while the model anisotropy in eq .",
    "( 3 ) well reproduces the observed global feature in fig .",
    "1(a ) , it is obviously too simple for reproducing the observed feature of the excess intensity at around @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is demonstrated clearly in fig .",
    "1(c ) displaying the significance of the residual anisotropy remaining after the subtraction of @xmath35 from fig .",
    "it is clear that the observed anisotropy contains an additional excess intensity along a plane which is almost perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this additional excess intensity was first reported as the  skewed \" feature from the long - term observations of sub - tev gcr intensity with underground muon detectors , but its physical origin has remained unknown @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is also clear in fig .",
    "1(c ) that the additional excess intensity extends along gurnett s hdp displayed by a black curve @xcite .",
    "we model this additional excess ( ae ) intensity by a pair of gaussians placed in gurnett s hdp , each centered away from the heliotail direction by an angle @xmath36 , as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are amplitudes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are widths parallel and perpendicular to the hdp respectively , @xmath42 is the  longitude \" of the center of ( @xmath34 ) pixel measured from the heliotail along the hdp and @xmath43 is the  latitude \" measured from the hdp .",
    "1(d ) displays the best - fit @xmath44 , while fig .",
    "1(e ) displays the combined model anisotropy @xmath20 best - fitting to @xmath10 in fig .",
    "1(a ) . as seen in fig .",
    "1(f ) showing the significance of the residual anisotropy remaining after the subtraction of @xmath20 from fig .",
    "1(a ) , this new model @xmath20 successfully reproduces the observed anisotropy including the  skewed \" feature of the excess intensity as well as the global feature . eleven best - fit parameters ( @xmath45 ) minimizing the residual @xmath21 in eq . (",
    "2 ) are listed in table i. the minimum @xmath21 divided by the degree of freedom ( 1269=72@xmath4618 - 16 - 11 ) is 1.791 .",
    "note that five amplitudes ( @xmath47 ) are uniquely determined by the least - square technique for each set of remaining six angle parameters ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the larmor radius of 5 tev gcr protons in a 3 @xmath49 g interstellar magnetic field is @xmath500.002 pc or 400 au , which is comparable to the scale of the heliosphere in the nose direction toward the upstream of the interstellar wind .",
    "this is one reason why the heliospheric modulation of the gcr intensity has been considered to be negligible in this energy region .",
    "the heliosphere , however , is also known to have a long heliotail extending over thousands of au , much longer than @xmath51 of 5 tev gcrs @xcite .",
    "the gcr modulation in the heliotail still remains possible , although it is not fully understood yet .",
    "recent observations also have suggested asymmetries of the heliosphere .",
    "based on the deflection of the interstellar neutral hydrogen flow vector from the helium flow vector observed at 1 au , lallement et al .",
    "deduced the hydrogen deflection plane ( hdp ) containing the interstellar wind velocity and the local interstellar magnetic field ( lismf ) and suggested a possible north - south asymmetry of the heliosphere due to the magnetic pressure of the lismf @xcite . from the observation of 2 - 3 khz radio emission from the outer heliosphere , gurnett et al .",
    "@xcite also deduced the hdp almost perpendicular to the galactic plane in a reasonable agreement with lallement et al .",
    "opher et al . analyzed the difference in the heliocentric distances to the solar wind termination shock observed by @xmath52 and @xmath53 at different heliographic latitudes and longitudes . by comparing the difference with the magneto - hydro - dymanic ( mhd ) simulations , they derived the north - south and east - west asymmetries of the heliosphere @xcite@xcite .    to achieve a good fit to the observed sky - map by tibet as experiment ,",
    "the model anisotropy is required to include an additional excess intensity in the gurnett s hdp plane .",
    "this additional anisotropy is best modeled with a pair of gaussians , each centerd @xmath54 away form the heliotail direction ( see @xmath36 in table i ) .",
    "the amplitude of the southern excess ( @xmath38 ) is as large as @xmath00.2 % more than twice the amplitude of the northern excess ( @xmath39 ) , possibly indicating a significant north - south asymmetry of the heliosphere .",
    "the tibet as experiment succeeded for the first time to reveal a clear signature of the asymmetric heliosphere in the sidereal anisotropy of the multi - tev gcr intensity .",
    "the collaborative experiment of the tibet air shower arrays has been performed under the auspices of the ministry of science and technology of china and the ministry of foreign affairs of japan .",
    "this work was supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , by grants - in - aid for science research from the japan society for the promotion of science in japan , and by the grants - in - aid from the national natural science foundation of china and the chinese academy of sciences .",
