    "a map between topological spaces is open if images of open sets are open . in symbolic dynamics ,",

    "it will also be shown that when the domain in theorem [ thm : main1 ] is of finite type and @xmath0 is finite - to - one , then the code is open if and only if  it is constant - to - one  ( see theorem [ thm : y_sofic ] ) .    in the early of 1990 s ,",
    "blanchard and hansel proved that an irreducible sofic constant - to - one  extension of an irreducible shift of finite type  is also of finite type @xcite . if either soficity or irreducibility is not assumed , then the statement is false @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that we need not assume the extension to be sofic and irreducible if the extension map is closing , i.e. , right closing  or left closing .",
