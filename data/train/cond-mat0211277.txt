    "one of the delights of @xmath3-electron metals is their tendency to show beautiful electronic ordering phenomena at low temperatures .",
    "typically one can expect to find long - range magnetic ordering , superconductivity , heavy - electron behaviour , or quantum critical effects , and sometimes two or more of these in the same material .",
    "the character of the ground state is often governed by several different microscopic interactions of comparable strength .",
    "the diversity of possible electronic phases is exemplified by the @xmath4ni@xmath0b@xmath0c family , @xmath4 being sc , y , most lanthanides , and some actinides.@xcite most members of this family exhibit either magnetic ordering or superconductivity , and for @xmath4 = dy , ho , er and tm there exists a temperature range over which superconductivity and magnetic order coexist .",
    "these four members of the family have been the subject of extensive investigations into the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the materials with @xmath4 = sc , y , lu , th and possibly ce are non - magnetic superconductors,@xcite whereas lani@xmath0b@xmath0c is a conventional metal . among the remaining members of the series , only ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c displays neither magnetic ordering nor superconductivity .",
    "this compound is metallic with enhanced electronic transport and thermodynamic coefficients at low temperatures , and for this reason it has been classified a heavy fermion system.@xcite    this paper addresses the nature of the ground state of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "since it is stoichiometric , ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c is one of a rather small number of known yb kondo - lattice compounds .",
    "its properties are then expected to be strongly influenced by local kondo singlet formation , with competition from long - range magnetic ordering of localized 4@xmath3 moments coupled by the rkky exchange interaction .",
    "given the right energy balance , kondo - lattice compounds can exhibit a coherent fermi liquid phase at low temperatures with strongly renormalized quasiparticles , or ` heavy fermions ' . in the heavy fermion state",
    "an abundance of low - energy spin fluctuations mediate the interactions between the quasiparticles and strongly influence the physical properties .",
    "an additional factor is the crystalline electric field ( cef ) , which by splitting the 4@xmath3 levels dictates the symmetry of the 4@xmath3 ground state and makes the effective 4@xmath3 magnetic moment temperature dependent .",
    "evidence for a coherent heavy fermion state in ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c has been found in several different properties.@xcite the electronic heat capacity has a peak near 8k , and decreases below 5k with a large slope corresponding to a sommerfeld coefficient @xmath5jmol@xmath6k@xmath7.@xcite this value of @xmath8 translates into a single - impurity kondo temperature @xmath9k .",
    "the resistivity decreases steadily below room temperature and then more sharply below a temperature in the range 1040k depending on the annealing treatment of the sample@xcite . at temperatures below @xmath101.5k",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity exhibits a positive curvature reminiscent of the @xmath11 variation characteristic of a strongly - correlated fermi liquid .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate measured by @xmath12 nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite shows a transition from local moment relaxation at high temperatures to korringa - like behaviour below 5k suggestive of a fermi liquid with a high density of states .",
    "finally , no magnetic ordering has been observed in ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c down to 0.023k,@xcite a temperature much less than the yb magnetic ordering temperature of 0.4k predicted by de gennes scaling from the heavy @xmath4 ions in @xmath4ni@xmath0b@xmath0c , and nearly four orders below the weiss temperature @xmath13k derived from a curie - weiss law fit to the high - temperature susceptibility .",
    "these observations suggest the existence of a strong antiferromagnetic interaction between yb and conduction band states , which causes a screening of the yb 4@xmath3 moment at low temperatures by the kondo effect .    here",
    "we describe neutron inelastic scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c in the 0200mev energy range .",
    "this technique directly measures the spin fluctuation spectrum , and allows us to determine the kondo , cef and rkky energy scales quantitatively .",
    "our main findings are ( i ) that the cef potential is larger than either the kondo or rkky interactions , and ( ii ) that the magnetic excitation spectra and other bulk magnetic properties can be quite well understood in terms of a model containing cef and kondo interactions provided that the latter is allowed to increase with temperature .",
    "a preliminary account of our experimental data was reported in ref . .",
    "neutron spectroscopic data have also been published by sierks it et al.,@xcite and though our conclusions are partly in accord with those of sierks _",
    "et al_. there are also differences which we will seek to explain later .",
    "experiments were performed on single - crystalline and polycrystalline ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "all the samples were prepared with boron enriched to 99.5% @xmath14 to reduce neutron absorption by the @xmath15 isotope present in natural boron .",
    "single - crystalline luni@xmath0b@xmath0c and polycrystalline y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c were used as non - magnetic reference samples .",
    "the single crystals were grown at ames laboratory by the high - temperature ni@xmath0b flux method.@xcite in the case of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c , excess yb was added to compensate for the loss due to evaporation . the crystals were plate - like with typical dimensions @xmath17mm@xmath18 , and the mass of the largest crystal was 0.25 g . for the neutron experiments we prepared a mosaic of 40 crystals with a total mass of approximately 1 g .",
    "the crystals were co - aligned to within 5@xmath19 and glued onto a thin sheet of aluminium .",
    "a similar mosaic of luni@xmath0b@xmath0c crystals was used to estimate the non - magnetic signal .",
    "polycrystalline ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c was prepared by a solid - state reaction method similar to that described by dhar _",
    "et al_,@xcite and polycrystalline y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c was prepared by the standard arc - melting technique under flowing argon .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction was used to check for impurities , and the ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c sample was found to contain a measurable amount of yb@xmath0o@xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , a quantitative analysis of the composition of this sample was carried out by multi - phase refinement of neutron powder diffraction data collected on the d1b diffractometer at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) .",
    "the amount of yb@xmath0o@xmath20 impurity was found to be 9% by mass .",
    "as described below , we corrected for the spurious signal produced by this impurity by performing measurements on commercially - obtained yb@xmath0o@xmath20 powder ( 99.9% purity ) under identical conditions as used for ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c , with y@xmath0o@xmath20 powder as the non - magnetic reference .",
    "the quantity measured by neutron inelastic scattering is the differential cross - section per unit solid angle @xmath21 and scattered neutron energy @xmath22 , given by @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the incident and scattered neutron wavevectors , @xmath26 is the response function of the sample , @xmath27 is the scattering vector , and @xmath28 is the energy transferred from the neutron to the sample . from linear response theory it can be shown that the dynamical part of the response function for a paramagnetic ion is given in the dipole approximation by@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 m is the classical electron radius , @xmath32 is the debye - waller factor , @xmath33 is the squared modulus of the magnetic form factor , @xmath34 is the planck distribution , @xmath35 is the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) component of the unit scattering vector , @xmath38 is a leading - diagonal element of the static single - ion susceptibility tensor@xcite , and @xmath39 is a spectral - weight function with unit normalization : @xmath40 in the case of a polycrystalline sample , eq.([eq : dynamic_res_fn_crystal ] ) must be averaged over all orientations . if , in addition , we extrapolate the scattering to zero @xmath41 then the expression for the dynamic part of the response function becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the powder - averaged static susceptibility .",
    "we employed four different neutron spectrometers to study the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were measured on the high energy transfer ( het ) chopper spectrometer at the isis spallation neutron source and on the in5 chopper spectrometer at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) .",
    "these experiments probed the energy ranges 5200mev and 0.32.5mev respectively .",
    "the single - crystal samples were measured on the in14 triple - axis spectrometer at the ill and on the in6 time - of - flight spectrometer , also at the ill .",
    "these latter experiments provided information on the @xmath41 dependence of the low - energy excitations in the energy ranges 0.26mev ( in14 ) and 0.24.5mev ( in6 ) .",
    "all four spectrometers were equipped with a variable - temperature liquid helium cryostat allowing measurements to be made as a function of temperature .",
    "experimental details specific to each spectrometer are as follows :    \\(1 ) het .",
    "data were collected in three runs , with neutrons of incident energy 35mev , 75mev and 250mev respectively .",
    "spectra recorded in banks of detectors distributed around the incident beam direction were averaged .",
    "the mass of polycrystalline ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c in the beam was approximately 13 g . to provide an estimate of the non - magnetic background scattering we also measured spectra at the same incident energies from a similar mass of polycrystalline y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "this composition was chosen because it has the same cross - section for neutron absorption as ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "\\(2 ) in5 .",
    "measurements were made with the incident energy fixed at 3.1mev .",
    "the data did not show any detectable @xmath41 dependence apart from a very slow reduction in intensity with @xmath44 for a given energy consistent with the variation of the magnetic form factor , and so the counts recorded in the whole detector bank ( extending from @xmath1015@xmath19 to @xmath10130@xmath19 in scattering angle ) were averaged to improve statistics .",
    "\\(3 ) in14 .",
    "spectra were recorded by scanning the incident neutron energy with a fixed final energy of @xmath45mev .",
    "the incident and final energies were selected by bragg reflection from arrays of pyrolytic graphite crystals .",
    "a beryllium filter was placed immediately after the sample to suppress higher - order harmonics in the scattered beam .",
    "two settings of the crystals were used , giving access to the @xmath46 and @xmath47 planes in reciprocal space .",
    "\\(4 ) in6 .",
    "the incident neutron energy was fixed at either 3.1mev or 4.9mev . as on in5",
    ", we averaged the neutron counts recorded in the whole detector ( @xmath1010@xmath19 to @xmath10115@xmath19 ) .",
    "this means that the recorded spectra correspond to an average over a range of @xmath41 .",
    "we chose two orientations of the crystal relative to the incident beam so that in one case the average @xmath48 was approximately parallel to the @xmath49 axis of the crystal , and in the other it was approximately parallel to the @xmath50 axis .",
    "on all the time - of - flight spectrometers ( het , in5 and in6 ) the scattering from a standard vanadium sample was used to normalize the data in different detector banks and to convert the spectra into units of absolute scattering cross - section .",
    "we begin with the high - energy data collected on het .",
    "figure[fig:1 ] shows an example of the raw data collected with an incident energy of 250mev and a sample temperature of 10k .",
    "the data are from a detector bank covering a range of scattering angle @xmath51 from 3@xmath19 to 7@xmath19 , i.e.@xmath52 .",
    "spectra from both ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c and y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c are shown .",
    "to a first approximation , the difference between the scattering from the two samples is the magnetic scattering , but a straight subtraction is not an entirely satisfactory way to isolate the magnetic scattering because ( a ) the nuclear scattering amplitudes of yb , y and lu are different , and ( b ) there are small differences in the phonon spectra of the two materials , particularly at low energy . for a more accurate estimate of the non - magnetic scattering from ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c we adopted the following procedure .",
    "first we took the ratio of the energy spectra from ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c and y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c measured in a high - angle ( @xmath10130@xmath19 ) detector bank . at high angles",
    "the spectrum measures the phonon density of states weighted by the scattering power of the elements .",
    "the magnetic scattering is negligible because of the decay of the magnetic form factor with @xmath53 .",
    "multiplication of this high - angle ratio by the low - angle spectrum of y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c then gives a good estimate of the non - magnetic low - angle background of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "this procedure is based on the assumption that the non - magnetic inelastic scattering at low angles is dominated by ( elastic + 1-phonon ) multiple scattering and therefore closely resembles the scattering measured at high angles .",
    "the validity of this assumption for high - energy neutrons incident normally on flat samples whose thickness is small compared to their lateral dimensions ( as is the case here ) has been verified previously by monte carlo simulations incorporating realistic model scattering cross - sections,@xcite and also accords with experience from many other similar experiments .",
    "the background derived this way is included in fig.[fig:1 ] and is generally a little higher than the intensity from y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "b@xmath0c and y@xmath16lu@xmath16ni@xmath0b@xmath0c on the het time - of - flight spectrometer .",
    "the incident neutron energy was 250mev , and the data shown were recorded in the het low - angle detector bank and normalized per formula unit ( f.u . ) of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "the ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c non - magnetic background scattering ( filled circles ) was estimated by the method described in the text .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    as mentioned earlier , the polycrystalline sample of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c used in these experiments was contaminated with 9% ( by mass ) of yb@xmath0o@xmath20 impurity . to correct for the signal from this yb@xmath0o@xmath20 we measured the energy spectra of polycrystalline samples of pure yb@xmath0o@xmath20 and y@xmath0o@xmath20 , the latter playing the part of the non - magnetic reference sample .",
    "we are not aware of any previous measurements of the magnetic excitations in yb@xmath0o@xmath20 , and so for reference we show in fig.[fig:2 ] the energy spectrum of yb@xmath0o@xmath20 after correction for the non - magnetic scattering by the method described above .",
    "corrections have also been made for the attenuation of the neutron beam in the sample and for the free - ion magnetic form factor of yb@xmath2 .",
    "hence , the quantity plotted on fig.[fig:2 ] is @xmath54 , the zero-@xmath41 magnetic response function .",

    "the authors investigated both the low and high energy part of the excitation spectrum using a polycrystalline sample of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c . without a non - magnetic reference spectrum",
    "they were not able to find the broad inelastic magnetic peaks centred on 18mev and 43mev we have identified here .",
    "they did , however , observe two inelastic magnetic features at low energies .",
    "one of these is a broad shoulder on the side of the elastic peak extending up to approximately 1mev , which developed into a quasielastic peak with increasing temperature , and the other a broader peak centred near 3.5mev .",
    "we believe the latter feature is what we have identified here as quasielastic scattering within the ground state doublet , but concerning the scattering below 1mev there is no sign of this in our data , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b .",
    "the possibility that this scattering is absent from our data because it is highly localized in reciprocal space can be discounted because the large detector bank of the in6 spectrometer used to collect the single - crystal data meant that the two scans shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b include data from all parts of the brillouin zone .",
    "the most likely explanation , therefore , is that the magnetic scattering observed by sierks _",

    "assuming the same impurity was responsible for the 0.5mev signal in sierks _ et al_. s data we estimate that their ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c sample contained @xmath104% yb@xmath0o@xmath20 .",

    "the data have been corrected for ( i ) the non - magnetic background , ( ii ) the attenuation of the neutron beam , and ( iii ) the magnetic form factor of yb@xmath2 .",

    "the results and analysis presented here reveal that the magnetic properties of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c are principally determined by cef and kondo interactions acting on the yb@xmath2 ions , with the cef about an order of magnitude larger than the kondo energy scale ( @xmath138k from the single - impurity expressions for the heat capacity and susceptibility , and @xmath139k from the quasielastic width)@xcite .",
    "any magnetic coupling between yb ions is negligible .",
    "the cef potential is roughly a factor 2 greater than found in other @xmath4ni@xmath0b@xmath0c compounds , presumably amplified by hybridization of the yb 4@xmath3 electrons with neighbouring atomic orbitals .",
    "being an electrostatic interaction , hybridization is expected to modify the cef to some degree ; here , the main effect seems to be a uniform enhancement of the cef without significant change in its anisotropy .",
    "the zzf approximation scheme for the anderson impurity hamiltonian succeeds in connecting the low temperature magnetic susceptibility and dynamic magnetic response , and thus provides a microscopic basis on which to interpret the properties of ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c . the effective kondo scale increases with temperature due to the thermal population of excited cef states and associated increase in orbital degeneracy and effective moment .",
    "this mechanism explains why the weiss temperature @xmath140 derived from the high temperature susceptibility is much larger than the value of the kondo temperature deduced from various low - temperature properties . in effect , @xmath140 is a measure of the high temperature kondo scale . it would be interesting to perform inelastic neutron scattering measurements at higher temperatures to test the zzf prediction of a marked broadening of the dynamic magnetic response with increasing @xmath119 .",
    "our work has shown that in most respects ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c can be understood in terms of conventional ideas for kondo - lattice intermetallic compounds .",
    "however , in one respect , not mentioned so far , there are indications that less conventional physics may be needed .",
    "this concerns the low temperature thermodynamic , transport and magnetic data which , if one examines the literature closely , are seen to exhibit significant deviations from fermi liquid behaviour .",
    "specifically , the susceptibility does not saturate below @xmath119,@xcite the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath8 continues to increase as @xmath118 tends to zero,@xcite and the low temperature resistivity could be consistent with a @xmath141 dependence with @xmath142.@xcite    these temperature dependences in fact bear a strong resemblence to non - fermi - liquid effects exhibited by ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , a material recently proposed to be the first example of a clean yb compound showing quantum - critical behaviour above a low - lying antiferromagnetic transition.@xcite we conjecture , therefore , that at zero temperature ybni@xmath0b@xmath0c may be close to a quantum - critical point _ on the non - magnetic side_. the ground state would then contain strong quantum fluctuations of the spins , and deviations from the kondo model should be expected . indeed , the fact that eq .",
