    "discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is a milestone in the success of standard model ( sm ) . however , there are still many unanswered questions and unsolved puzzles , ranging from dark matter to the hierarchy problem to the strong - cp problem .",
    "but there is no experimental result that can explain such unsolved problems with standard particle physics . out of various interesting alternatives ,",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) and extra dimensional models are the most popular frameworks for going beyond the sm of particle physics . in this work",
    "we consider a typical extra - dimensional model where all sm particles can access an extra space - like dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we use the results @xcite presented by the atlas collaborations of search for a high - mass resonances decaying into the @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) pair to constrain the parameter space of such a model where the lowest ( @xmath6 ) kk - excitations are unstable due to lack of any specified symmetry .",
    "we are interested in a specific framework , called the universal extra dimension ( ued ) @xcite scenario , characterised by a single flat extra space like dimension @xmath4 which is compactified on a circle @xmath7 of radius @xmath8 and has an imposed @xmath9 symmetry ( @xmath10 ) to accommodate chiral fermions , hence the compactified space is called @xmath0 orbifold . from a four - dimensional viewpoint ,",
    "every field will then have an infinite tower of kk - modes , the zero modes being identified as the sm states . in this orbifold a @xmath11 amount of translation in @xmath4 direction leads to a conserved kk - parity given by @xmath12 .",
    "the conservation of kk - parity ensures that the lightest @xmath6 kk - particle called lightest kaluza - klein ( lkp ) is absolutely stable and hence is a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "as the masses of the sm particles being small compared to @xmath13 , hence this scenario leads to an almost degenerate particle spectrum at each kk - level .",
    "this mass degeneracy could be lifted by radiative corrections .",
    "being an extra dimensional theory and hence being non - renormalizable , this can only be an effective theory characterised by a cut - off scale @xmath14 .",
    "so at the two fixed points ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) of @xmath0 orbifold , one can include four - dimensional kinetic and/or mass terms for the kk - states .",
    "these terms are also required as counterterms for cut - off dependent loop - induced contributions @xcite of the five - dimensional theory . in the minimal universal extra - dimensional models ( mued ) these terms",
    "are fixed by requiring that the five - dimensional loop contributions @xcite are exactly cancelled at the cut - off scale @xmath14 and the boundary values of the corrections , e.g. , logarithmic mass corrections of kk - particles , can be taken to be zero at the scale @xmath14 .",
    "there are several existing literature @xcite , @xcite-@xcite in which we can find how the experimental results constrain the values of the two basic parameters ( @xmath8 and @xmath14 ) of mued theory .    in this work",
    "we generate non - conservation of kk - parity by adding unequal boundary terms at the two fixed boundary points .",
    "consequently @xmath6 kk - states are no longer stable . hence the single production of @xmath6 kk - states and its subsequent decay into @xmath17 states would be possible via this non - conservation of kk - parity .",
    "we will utilise this kk - parity - non - conserving coupling of the @xmath18 to a pair of sm fermions ( @xmath19 states ) @xcite to calculate the ( resonance ) production cross section of @xmath18 in @xmath20 collisions at the lhc ( 8 tev ) and its subsequent decays to @xmath21/@xmath22 , assuming @xmath1 to be the lightest kk - particles . once @xmath1",
    "are produced via kk - parity - non - conserving coupling , the kk - parity - conserving decaying mode being kinematically disallowed , thus the @xmath1 decay to a pair of zero - mode fermions via the same kk - parity - non - conserving coupling .",
    "a search for high - mass resonances based on 8 tev lhc @xmath20 collision data collected by the atlas and cms have been reported in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present the expected and observed exclusion upper limits on cross section times branching ratio at 95% c.l . for the combined dielectron and dimuon channels for resonance search . in this article",
    "we have used the above results to constrain the masses of the @xmath6 level kk - fermions and @xmath23 of the model . in an earlier article @xcite",
    "we have reported the production of @xmath2 kk - excitation of gluon and its subsequent decay to @xmath24 pair at the lhc .",
    "both the production and decay are governed by kk - parity - non - conserving interaction .",
    "constraints have been also derived by comparing the @xmath24 cross section with lhc data from cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows .",
    "at first we present the relevant couplings and masses in the framework of ued with asymmetric boundary localized kinetic terms .",
    "we then review the expected @xmath3 signal from the combined production of the @xmath1 at the lhc and their subsequent decay .",
