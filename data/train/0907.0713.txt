    "for example , the @xmath2 symmetric constituent quark model predicts a large number of states many of which have not been observed experimentally using hadronic probes .",
    "a model that includes clustering of two quarks into di - quarks has fewer degrees of freedom and predicts a smaller number of excited states .",
    "it is obviously important to obtain a better understanding of the degrees of freedom underlying the nucleon properties .",
    "most studies of the nucleon spectrum have used pion probes .",
    "electromagnetic probes , photons and electrons , and strangeness production are complementary ways to search for some of the excited states and can help discriminate between alternative description of the nucleon spectrum .",
    "the clas program is designed to accurately measure electromagnetic cross sections and single and double polarization observables with wide energy and angle coverage .",

    "circularly polarized photons can be generated by scattering the highly polarized electron beam from an amorphous radiator .",
    "it is well understood that measurements of differential cross sections in photoproduction of single pseudoscalar mesons alone results in ambiguous solutions for the contributing resonant partial waves .",
    "the @xmath9 program at jlab is therefore aimed at complete , or nearly complete measurements for processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
