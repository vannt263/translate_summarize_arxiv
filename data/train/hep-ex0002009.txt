    "radiative kaon decays provide a testing ground for chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "chpt provides a framework for calculating the decay rates for several modes , either directly or relative to other measured modes .",
    "the radiative modes are important for determining long distance contributions to other decays of interest : the two - photon contribution to @xmath0 , and the cp - conserving and indirect cp - violating contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they are also important as backgrounds to other modes ( e.g. the @xmath3 background to @xmath4 ) .",
    "a number of recent results have been reported in the literature , as well as in several recent conferences@xcite .",
    "the radiative k@xmath5 decays : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have two contributions .",
    "one is inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) radiation from one of the charged particles .",
    "the second is direct emission ( de ) from the vertex .",
    "the branching ratio of the ib contribution scales with the underlying k@xmath5 decay rate . whereas , the rate for direct emission is expected to be roughly comparable for all three modes .",
    "a new result@xcite for @xmath9 from ktev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_klppg ] . the energy of the photon is shown , along with the contributions from ib and de .",
    "the de component is modified by a `` @xmath10-propagator '' that serves to soften the de spectrum .",
    "the branching ratio for the direct emission component ( see eq.[eqn_klppg ] ) is @xmath11 the ratio of direct emission to de+ib is ( see eq.[eqn_klppg_de ] ) @xmath12 this result is based on @xmath135% of the total ktev data for this mode .",
    "there are new results from e787@xcite in the charged decay mode ( @xmath14 ) as well .",
    "this result is striking , in that the branching ratio is a factor of 4 lower than the previous value .",
    "the data is traditionally expressed in terms of the variable w , which is defined as : @xmath15 the new result from e787 , shown in figure  [ fig_kppg ] ,    has about 8 times higher statistics than the old one .",
    "the branching ratio for the direct emission component , from a fit to ib and de ( see eq.[eqn_kppg ] ) is @xmath16 this represents half of the e787 data that is currently on tape .",
    "the interference term is small , @xmath17% and the direct emission is @xmath18% .",
    "the decay rate , corrected to full phase space , is now measured to be similar to that for @xmath19 : @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 .",
    "ktev also has new results on @xmath22 , where the photon has internally converted to two electrons .",
    "in addition to measuring the branching ratio@xcite , a t - odd observable in the angular distribution of the plane of the @xmath23-pair vs. the plane of the electron pair is observed@xcite .",
    "this data represents one quarter of the final ktev sample .",
    "a summary of the current experimental status of radiative k@xmath5 decays is shown in table  [ tab_kzppg ] .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ summary of radiative k@xmath5 results . _ [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_kpppg ]    a couple of modes should be seen for the first time in existing data , @xmath24 ( e787 ) and @xmath25 ( e865 ) .",
    "improvements in other modes may be possible , particularly at ihep .",
    "several new results are expected from ktev and na48 , as well as a few more from e787,e865 and e871 . with the turn on of da@xmath26ne and kloe , which is well equipped for the radiative modes",
    ", we can expect another round of new measurements .",
    "finally , the next generation of rare kaon experiments , designed to fully constrain the ckm unitarity triangle , by measuring the ` golden modes ' @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are under construction ( e391a , e949 ) or being designed ( kopio , ckm , kami ) .",
    "these experiments will provide even more precise measurements of several radiative modes .",
    "i would like to thank several people from various experiments for providing data and discussions for this talk , including : hong ma , mike zeller , bob tschirhart , john belz , lutz koepke , bill molzon , leonid landsberg , takeshi komatsubara , takashi nakano and laurie littenberg .",
