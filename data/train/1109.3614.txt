    "despite the progress that has been made in imaging , diagnosis , treatment and understanding of cancer , the survival rates of patients with metastatic or recurrent neoplasias as well as patients with tumors at unresectable locations are still poor , and new therapeutic strategies are needed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , occult dormant micrometastasis raise new challenges concerning their reactivation and evolution into clinically manifested disease , particularly after primary tumor resection @xcite .",
    "oncolytic virotherapy is claimed to be a promising anti - cancer strategy , because it can provide a locoregional control or even eradication of tumors without cross - resistance with standard therapies .",
    "oncolytic viruses are able to selectively infect and kill tumor cells by exploiting the same cellular defects that promote tumor growth @xcite . to date , several different viruses are known to be selectively oncolytic @xcite .",
    "an archetype is the adenovirus commonly used in gene therapy and oncolytic therapy experiments @xcite .",
    "some studies indicate that the virus effectiveness strongly depends on the specific cancer cell line @xcite .",
    "so , one can hypothesize that for each tumor there must exist an oncolytic virus that maximizes the therapeutic success .",
    "several mathematical models have been proposed to study virotherapy @xcite .",
    "they emerge as valuable tools to provide quantitative understanding of the major mechanisms that affect anti - cancer treatment based on viruses and to select parameter ranges that enhance its therapeutic success . specially because , in face of the nonlinearities and complexity involved in cancer progression and its interaction with oncolytic viruses , intuitive reasoning alone may be insufficient .",
    "the current paradigm is that the viral life cycle should lead to rapid replication , cytolysis and spread @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the limitations and validity of this appealing , intuitive , and seemingly logical paradigm remains unclear .",
    "indeed , at least one mathematical result @xcite indicates that viruses able to destroy tumor cells very fast does not necessarily lead to a more effective control of tumor growth .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that a successful virotherapy of compact tumors requires both highly spreading viruses and an optimal range of viral cytotoxity , i. e , neither a too short nor a very large time for the lysis of cancer cells .",
    "however , this result was derived assuming that the viruses are a continuous field whose dynamics is described by a reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "furthermore , the changes in the stationary local concentrations of viruses due to their entry at cell infections were neglected and the viral burst size used , equal to the initial viral load , was orders of magnitude greater than the larger ones observed for real oncolytic viruses .    in the present paper , a multiscale model based on the approach proposed by ferreira et al .",
    "@xcite was modified to take explicitly into account the individual , discrete nature of the oncolytic viruses and applied to evaluate the efficacy of virotherapy against compact , papillary and diffuse ( disconnected ) solid tumors .",
    "considering virus as discrete agents provides a more realistic description of virus entry and replication , key processes involved in oncolytic virotherapy .",
    "our main goal is provide useful insights about how to match the oncolytic virus and the tumor type in order to get the better outcome for the therapy .",
    "figure @xmath0 illustrates the multiple agents and processes involved in the model at distinct time and length scales .",
    "the tissue is modelled by a square lattice fed through a single capillary vessel at its top .",
    "four different cell types ( normal and dead cells , uninfected and infected tumor cells ) and an oncolytic virus are considered .",
    "these individual agents are described by their populations @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively , at every site @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to the normal and dead cells , one or more uninfected or infected cancer cells can pile up in a given site , reflecting the fact that the division of tumor cells is not constrained by contact inhibition . in turn , since the viruses are very small particles in comparison with cells , there is no constraint on their population .",
    "the nutrients , diffusing from the capillary vessel throughout the tissue , are divided into two groups : those that limits cell replication but are not demanded for cell survival ( @xmath6 ) and those essential to maintain the basic cell functions and whose deprivation can induce death ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "both nutrient types are described by continuous fields @xmath8 , which evolve in space and time according the simplest ( linear with constant coefficients ) dimensionless reaction - diffusion equations    @xmath9    the factors @xmath10 take into account distinct nutrient uptake rates for normal and cancer cells .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 sets up a characteristic length scale for nutrient diffusion in the normal tissue ( see reference @xcite for the complete variable transformations leading to this dimensionless equation ) .",
    "( [ dif_nut ] ) obeys a periodic boundary condition along the direction parallel to the capillary and a neumann boundary condition at the border of the tissue . at the capillary vessel the nutrient concentrations are",
    "@xmath12 ( continuous and fixed supply ) .",
    "each uninfected cancer cell , randomly selected with equal probability , can carry out one of four actions :    1-*mitotic replication * , with a probability    @xmath13 } , \\label{pdiv}\\ ] ]    an increasing function of the concentration per cancer cell of the nutrients @xmath14 .",
    "the daughter cell randomly occupies one of their normal or necrotic nearest neighbor sites , whether there exists any , or piles up at its mother site . in the simulations , we observed at most three or four cancer cells at the same site simultaneously .",
    "2-*death * , with a probability    @xmath15 } , \\label{pdel}\\ ] ]    that increases with the scarcity of nutrients @xmath16 essential to sustain the cell metabolism .",
    "3-*migration * , with a probability    @xmath17 } , \\label{pmov}\\ ] ]    that increases with the local population of cancer cells and the nutrient concentration per cell .",
    "a probability increasing with the nutrient concentration is justified by the necessity of nutrients for cell motility and , in addition , by the degradation of the extracellular matrix nearby the tumor surface that releases several chemicals which promote cell migration and proliferation .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with experimental data in multicellular tumor spheroids @xcite and was previously used in other mathematical models @xcite .",
    "the migrating cell moves to one of its nearest - neighbor sites chosen at random , interchanging its position with a normal or necrotic cell if there exists any .",
    "if the interchanged normal or necrotic cell moved to a site still occupied by other cancer cells , it is eliminated .",
    "these rules for cancer growth are similar to those used by scalerandi et al .",
    "@xcite in a deterministic model with collective cell actions controlled by threshold ( step ) functions of the nutrient concentration per cancer cell .",
    "4-*become infected * with a probability    @xmath18 } , \\label{pinf}\\ ] ]    an increasing function of the local viral load per cell , controlled by the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the model assumes perfect viral selectivity for cancer cells , thereby the infection of normal cells by oncolytic viruses is neglected .",
    "the number of viruses @xmath20 that infect a given cell is selected from a poisson distribution ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the typical viral entry .",
    "this poisson law has been observed in cell cultures as a function of the multiplicity of infection ( moi ) , defined as the ratio between the total viral load injected in the system and the number of target cells @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that an infected cancer cell does not divide nor migrate because its slaved cellular machinery is focused on virus replication .",
    "it is also assumed that infected cancer cells sustain their metabolism until lysis and die only by lysis .",
    "the death by lysis occurs with a probability    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the time elapsed since the cell infection and @xmath25 is the characteristic time for cell lysis .",
    "the lysis of each infected cancer cell releases    @xmath26    free viruses to the extra - cellular medium . here",
    ", the maximum virus burst size @xmath27 and @xmath28 are model parameters . at the time of lysis ,",
    "the new free viruses remains on the site of the lysed cell .",
    "they diffuse independently through the tissue by performing lattice random walks comprising @xmath29 steps and are cleared at a rate @xmath30 at each time step .",
    "the clearance rate @xmath30 embodies the complex innate and adaptive immune responses to a virus . such response involves the synthesis of antiviral cytokines , activation / selection of immune cells , and production of antiviral antibodies @xcite .",
    "the tumor starts to grow from a single cancer cell and the therapy begins when the tumor attains @xmath31 cells .",
    "it consists of a single direct intratumoral administration in which @xmath32 viruses are uniformly spread over the entire tumor .",
    "this approach corresponds to the experimental protocols used in severe combined immune deficient ( scid ) mice @xcite and in vitro assays @xcite .",
    "indeed , in most of the in vivo virotherapy experiments the virus are injected directly into a subcutaneous , avascular tumor developed in mice .",
    "more details concerning the procedures used for model simulations are provided in appendices a and b.",
    "we are interested on the effects of virotherapy on compact , papillary and disconnected tumors , the general morphologies observed in solid malignant neoplasias .",
    "typical patterns corresponding to such morphologies were simulated using the multiscale model for the growth of avascular tumors studied in reference @xcite .",
    "they are shown in figure @xmath33 and the model parameters used are listed in table 1 .",
    "typical progress curves for cancer cells and free viruses in a simulated virotherapy of a diffuse tumor are shown in figure @xmath34 .",
    "similar time evolutions are also observed for solid and papillary neoplastic morphologies ( see appendix c ) .",
    "two regimes are observed : either the cancer cell population keeps growing after the virus administration or both cancer cells and oncolytic viruses are eradicated . in the former regime ,",
    "in which the virotherapy fails , the viruses can be either eradicated or coexist with the tumor cells .",
    "such coexistence can exhibit oscillations in cancer cells and virus populations due to successive rounds of infection unable to eliminate the tumor . as previously reported @xcite",
    ", it is worth to emphasize that any of these behaviors can randomly emerge as the response of a given tumor to the virotherapy .",
    "hence , it becomes imperative to determine for each tumor morphology the most probable prognosis after the treatment as well as the chances for the occurrence of the other tumor responses as functions of the virotherapeutic parameters .",
    "the probabilities for the eradication of a papillary tumor are shown in figure @xmath35 .",
    "as one can see , a single intratumoral administration of an aggressive virus ( @xmath36 ) at a @xmath37 with viral entry @xmath38 , low clearance rate @xmath39 and @xmath40 can eradicate the tumor .",
    "even viruses with low replicative potential , associated to small burst sizes ( @xmath41 , for instance ) , have almost @xmath42 of efficacy if they spread very slowly ( @xmath43 ) throughout the papillary tumor . as shown in figure @xmath35(a ) , the anti - tumor efficacy of low - diffusive viruses depends very weakly on @xmath25 , the characteristic time spent by the virus to induce the lysis of infected cancer cells . furthermore , the anti - tumor efficacy decreases rapidly with the increase of the virus diffusivity , almost vanishing for @xmath44 . in contrast , for a highly replicative virus ( burst size @xmath45 ) , the tumor eradication is almost always certain .",
    "the exceptions are for highly cytolytic ( @xmath46 ) and diffusive ( @xmath47 ) viruses . indeed , as shown in figure @xmath35(b )",
    ", the probability of therapeutic success goes to zero if the oncolytic virus spreads very fast on the tissue and quickly kills cancer cells .",
    "bearing in mind the current paradigm ( fastest viral replication , cytolysis and spreading ) , the correlations revealed here among therapeutic outcomes and the traits of the anti - tumor vectors figure out a counter intuitive scenario .",
    "indeed , a low viral diffusivity , independently on the cytolytic period @xmath25 and replicative capacity @xmath27 , is sufficient because papillary malignant neoplasias grow slowly .",
    "nonetheless , one can argue that virus exhibiting low diffusion rates in tissues will hardly reach the tumor if intravenously or systemically administered .",
    "hence this trait should be clinically avoided unless delivery barriers have been overcame through some `` pro - diffusive '' strategy . as an alternative ,",
    "our results indicate that fast spreading viruses combining high replication potentials and slow citolysis can successfully eliminate papillary tumors .",
    "the aforementioned results should be confronted with those obtained for a compact tumor in order to determine if the most effective virus against papillary tumors is equally efficient in the treatment of a compact tumor .",
    "compact morphologies are generated in our model when competition for nutrients is weak and , consequently , the tumor grows fast . the same oncolytic virus and treatment protocol successfully used for papillary tumors ( @xmath39 , @xmath36 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath40 ) fails for compact tumors .",
    "they are not eradicated for any @xmath25 and @xmath29 values studied even for a large burst size ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "so , very efficient viruses against papillary tumors can be ineffective to eradicate compact tumors .",
    "while the number of cancer cells increases , the viruses either become extinct , if @xmath50 , or coexist with the growing tumor , if @xmath51 . in the coexistence regime , the tumor grows continuously but at a lower rate .",
    "given that solid tumors grow faster than ramified ones , it seems intuitive to assume that more diffusive viruses might be more effective against the neoplastic mass .",
    "however , the success probabilities remain null if only the viral diffusivity is increased up to values so large as @xmath52 .",
    "one alternative towards a successful therapy is reinforce the viral load initially administered .",
    "nonetheless , even at larger @xmath53s ( @xmath54 , for instance ) the therapy still completely fails if the viral entry @xmath49 is maintained .",
    "the value @xmath49 implies that in average only one virus invades a cell at each infection event .",
    "a remaining strategy to control compact tumor growth is enhance the viral entry . as one can see in figure @xmath55(a ) , a large viral entry ( @xmath56 ) has a dramatic effect on the therapeutic success .",
    "indeed , the virotherapy only fails , even using a @xmath48 , for very low viral diffusivity ( @xmath57 ) and large lytic period ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "furthermore , a significant success is achieved by reducing @xmath22 while , in balance , raising the @xmath53 used .",
    "this is shown in figure @xmath55(b ) in which @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", a successful therapy demands an oncolytic virus with appropriated diffusivity and lytic cycle . an adequate diffusion ( @xmath61 )",
    "allows viral spreading throughout the compact tumor at a rate similar or greater than that of the growing neoplasia . but fixed the viral diffusivity , the time @xmath25 must lie within a certain range , as for instance @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , a very rapid cytolysis promptly forms `` voids '' containing the majority of the newly released viruses , which impair the generation of new infection waves . in turn , a very long @xmath25 generates successive waves of infection at a low frequency unable to destroy the tumor .",
    "these results are consistent with those reported on reference @xcite , supporting the robustness of both models .    at last ,",
    "the response of diffuse tumors to virotherapy was investigated . in our model",
    "those disconnected patterns emerge for highly motile cells that uptake nutrients at moderate rates . considering an oncolytic virotherapy based on a viral agent with high replicative capacity",
    ", the probability for the eradication of a diffuse tumor is shown in figure @xmath64 .",
    "as one can see , the success probability also vanishes for highly diffusive viruses and increases significantly for viruses spreading slowly .",
    "optimal oncolytic viruses for treat diffuse tumors should combine high replicative rates and intermediate diffusivity .",
    "if the virus has a slower spreading , then a short time for induce the lysis of infected cancer cells is demanded in order to maximize the therapeutic success . at larger viral spreading ( @xmath65 ) the success probability exhibit a re - entrant behavior characterized by an initial decrease , followed by an increase of the therapeutic success as the cytolytic period @xmath25 increases .",
    "in this work we investigated the oncolytic virotherapeutic outcomes for solid ( compact , papillary and diffuse ) tumors using numerical simulations .",
    "we focussed our study on vectors with high infectivities and small clearance rates corresponding to a severe suppression of the host immune response .",
    "furthermore , since in the present framework the discrete nature of the oncolytic virus allows a more realistic modeling of viral infection and replication processes , the central roles of viral burst size @xmath27 , virus entry @xmath22 and initial moi for the therapeutic success are highlighted .",
    "figure @xmath34 illustrates our typical results : after a single intratumoral virus administration , these tumors can either be completely eradicated or keep growing with time despite a transient remission , as previously obtained for compact tumors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the last behavior can be either a monotonic or an oscillating growth .",
    "it is worthy to notice that such oscillations were observed in human myeloma xenografts induced in mice treated with measles virus ( mv ) @xcite , in an ovarian cancer xenograft model @xcite , and in a mathematical approach used by dingli _",
    "et al . _ for modeling mv virotherapy @xcite .",
    "the therapeutic outcome depends on both viral characteristics and tumor dynamics .",
    "so , for fixed viral infectivity @xmath19 and persistence within the tissue determined by @xmath30 , the key parameters that control treatment success are the virus entry @xmath22 , viral diffusivity @xmath29 , characteristic lytic time @xmath25 and tumor growth rates .    concerning the virotherapy of solid tumors ,",
    "two main results deserve special attention .",
    "firstly , in the case of a low virus entry ( @xmath49 ) successful therapeutic outcomes were observed only at large , but realistic , initial mois and viral burst sizes .",
    "it must be mentioned that the viral burst size used in reference @xcite , equal to the initial viral load , was one order of magnitude greater than the larger viral burst sizes observed for real oncolytic viruses . in turn",
    ", the large initial mois required by successful virotherapies in our present simulations with @xmath49 raises the question of the clinical risks involved .",
    "viral doses ranging from about @xmath66 pfu ( @xmath67 ) to @xmath68 pfu ( @xmath69 ) were used in experimental tests @xcite .",
    "also , it is known that the oncolytic adenovirus dl1520 ( or onyx-015 ) is well tolerated at the higher practical administered doses ( @xmath70@xmath71 particles ) @xcite .",
    "but at very high viral titer ( about @xmath72 particle per kg ) this virus caused the death of a gene therapy patient with ornithine - cystosine transferase deficiency @xcite .",
    "hence , the use of reduced viral doses is pursued in clinical applications , particularly in order to allow for systemic administration .",
    "successful outcomes could be accomplished by raising the viral entry @xmath22 ( see figure @xmath55 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath22 represents the average number of virus entering in a cancer cell at infection .",
    "thus , large values of @xmath22 result in a high production of new viruses ( @xmath73 , the viral burst size ) that are released after cell lysis .",
    "this local enhancement of the free virus load enlarges , in turn , the probability of further cancer cell infection .",
    "the consequence of such a positive feedback cycle is that the initial viral load is sufficient to trigger a powerful first wave of infection , whose successive rounds ends to destroy the tumor .",
    "moreover , as shown in figure @xmath55(b ) , a relatively slight and simultaneous increase of both virus entry and @xmath53 can be enough to guarantee a successful oncolytic treatment of compact tumors with safe viral doses .",
    "secondly , considering that large viral loads involve risks and that an elevated virus entry may represent a significant technical barrier , treatments based on intermediate @xmath53s and @xmath22 values become of special interest . in this range ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 )",
    ", the key factors determining the therapeutic success are viral diffusivity and cytolytic period .",
    "the probability of tumor eradication vanishes for viruses that diffuse very fast even at large mois .",
    "indeed , a very rapid spreading disperses the viruses outside the growing tumor where they can not trigger new waves of infection .",
    "in turn , since the growth of compact tumors is faster , an effective oncolytic virus must not diffuse slower than the tumor spreading . at intermediate values of @xmath22 and @xmath53 , in addition to be able to spread at a rate similar to that of the growing tumor , the virus must induce the lysis of infected cancer cells neither too slowly nor too fast . if the time @xmath25 for cytolysis is very short , `` voids '' containing the majority of the new released viruses are rapidly formed throughout the tumor .",
    "these viruses can not trigger new infection waves and cancer cells at the border of some voids escape . in turn , if @xmath25 is very long , the successive waves of infection are generated at a low frequency , excessively distant in time to destroy the tumor .",
    "these findings are consistent with the predictions in figure 5 of reference @xcite which suggests that the ideal oncolytic virus should have neither a very short nor a long lytic cycle .",
    "summarizing , a successful virotherapy of compact tumors demands the simultaneous optimization of several factors : the use of oncolytic viruses with high replicative capacities ( burst sizes ) , adequate diffusivities ( rapid but not too rapid spreading ) and lytic cycle ( neither too short nor too long ) , as well as a large initial viral entry .",
    "the importance of the initial moi , strongly emphasized by demers et al . @xcite and myers et al .",
    "@xcite , is much smaller than that associated to the virus entry . in those experiments , huge variations in the initial viral load , from @xmath76",
    "to @xmath77 viral particles , were performed .",
    "such values correspond to @xmath53s ranging from around @xmath78 to about @xmath79 .",
    "as one can intuitively expect , our simulations evidence that a huge @xmath53 eradicate the tumor independently of other factors ( viral traits and tumor growth dynamics ) .",
    "however , for virotherapies based on low virus entries and @xmath53s there is , fixed the viral diffusivity , an optimal range for its lytic cycle period because the virotherapy fails if the cytolysis is either too short or too long .",
    "this result is in complete agreement with the findings of paiva _ et al .",
    "furthermore , we point out that the virotherapeutic efficacy is much more sensitive to other parameters , for instance viral entry and burst size , than to @xmath53 .    with regard to papillary tumors ,",
    "a virotherapy based on small virus entry ( @xmath49 ) and initial viral load ( @xmath48 ) can control cancer growth . in this case",
    "the key factors determining a successful therapeutic outcome are the virus spreading and its replicative ability .",
    "indeed , for small viral burst sizes the therapeutic outcome for papillary tumors is almost independent on @xmath25 .",
    "we find that the virotherapy fails for oncolytic viruses with high diffusivity .",
    "success probabilities greater than @xmath80 are observed only for very small diffusivities ( @xmath81 ) . in contrast , for a fixed diffusivity , the therapeutic success of highly replicative viruses exhibits a re - entrant behavior as a function of their lytic periods , as shown in figure @xmath35(b ) . again , our simulations suggest an optimal range for the time @xmath25 demanded by the oncolytic virus to kill an infected tumor cell .    at last , for",
    "fixed small virus entry ( @xmath49 ) and initial viral load ( @xmath48 ) , optimal oncolytic viruses for treat diffuse tumors should exhibit high replicative rates and intermediate diffusivity .",
    "for faster viral spreading ( @xmath82 ) , a successful therapeutic outcome has a complex dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "a re - entrant behavior is observed , leading to a decreasing success probability at an intermediate range of the time @xmath25 for cytolysis .",
    "in contrast , for oncolytic viruses having very slower spreadings , highly successful therapies demanded short times for induce the lysis of infected cancer cells .",
    "a relevant issue is how our simulation results can be compared with those obtained from experimental assays or clinical trials on oncolytic virotherapy . unfortunately , this represents a difficult task due to the scarcity of quantitative experimental data .",
    "most of the studies on oncolytic virotherapy focused primarily on the safety of these vectors and evaluate the anti - cancer efficacy of viruses .",
    "tests _ in vitro _ involves cancer cells cultured in monolayer or 3d compact tumor spheroid models . either the xenograft models in experimental animals or the human tumors treated in clinical trials are also solid tumors with compact morphologies .",
    "furthermore , since very distinct tumors were treated using several different viruses , both the system and the therapeutic conditions varied widely .",
    "hence , almost all parameters have changed simultaneously from one experiment to another .",
    "basically , the results are qualitative : the anti - tumor efficacy of viruses has been limited .",
    "virotherapy is impaired by multiple factors , specially the low viral loads and its suboptimal delivery to the target site , barriers to viruses spreading within the tumor and the host immune response against these vectors .",
    "our simulations reveal that the virus entry @xmath22 is the major parameter determining the therapeutic outcome .",
    "once its value is fixed , the lower is the initial dose of virus administered , smaller is the chance of tumor eradication .",
    "experimental @xcite and mathematical @xcite results support this direct correlation between moi and therapeutic success .",
    "also , our simulations indicate that virus replication within the tumor tissue , modelled by the viral burst size @xmath27 , is the next main trait in the hierarchy of factors determining the virotherapeutic success .",
    "such finding is supported by observations from friedman _",
    "decreasing in the hierarchy , the viral diffusivity emerges as the next key parameter for a successful virotherapy .",
    "experimental observations reporting that antitumor efficacy increases as intratumoral virus spreading is enhanced due to voids and channels generated by induced cancer cell apoptosis inside a tumor @xcite are in agreement with this result .",
    "finally , experimental data that confront our results concerning the effects of the cytolytic time on the therapeutic outcome are lacking .    from our model simulations",
    "the efficiency of virus entry in a cell , its replicative capacity inside an infected cell , and its diffusivity within the tumor tissue emerges as three crucial factors to fuel and amplify the successive rounds of infection necessary to control or eradicate the tumor .",
    "hence , it is worthy to briefly comment about some trends on the experimental research in these directions .",
    "concerning virus entry , a major challenge is the engineering of entry proteins to achieve higher infectivity .",
    "but this approach is diametrically opposite to the search for entry inhibitors , neutralizing antibodies and vaccine immunogens that elicit antibodies against virus entry proteins @xcite . instead of fight virus",
    ", the goal is transform it into a better entry machine while reinforcing its retargeting specificity",
    ". here , experimental results are scarce and constrained to comparative analysis of the infectivity of distinct oncolytic viruses .",
    "thus , for instance , ketola et al .",
    "@xcite compared the oncolysis in five human osteosarcoma cell cultures infected with the semliki forest virus @xmath83 and the adenovirus @xmath84 .",
    "they found that the kinetics of adenovirus infection was much slower than that of semliki forest virus .",
    "high amounts of adenoviruses were required to assure their spread throughout the cell culture and to lyse all the osteosarcoma cells . also , the authors demonstrated differential efficacy of the semliki forest virus against the human osteosarcoma cell lines .",
    "virus spreading was observed in four of five cell lines studied . in particular , the cell lineage @xmath85 seemed to be relatively resistant to the @xmath83 infection .",
    "clearly , these results can be understood in terms of differences in virus entry and replicative capacity as evidenced in our model . by the way ,",
    "some attempts to enhance the replication of oncolytic viruses have been performed since , for instance , the burst size of a wild - type hsv is one or two orders of magnitude greater than that of the engineered vector hrr3 .",
    "alternatives include to place viral genes under the transcriptional control of tumor specific promoters @xcite or mutate viruses to express genes that overcome tumor cell pathways blocking viral protein synthesis @xcite . again , more attention need to be paid to this approach .",
    "a greater activity is observed in the field of virus spreading .",
    "several vasoactive cytokines , or physical treatments , such as radiation or heat , increase tumor vascular permeability and blood flow , leading to faster diffusion @xcite .",
    "such strategies can be particularly relevant for systemic virus administration and to treat tumors at the vascular stage , mainly compact tumors exhibiting a fast growth as our results indicate .",
    "the incorporation of lytic enzymes , such as hyaluronidase , into a conditionally replicative adenovirus could also increase diffusion rates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , agents that decrease the glycosaminoglycan concentration @xcite or that degrade interstitial collagen @xcite can improve transport in tumors .",
    "for instance , tumor collagen can significantly hinder diffusion , and it was shown @xcite that the matrix metalloproteinases@xmath86 and @xmath87 can modulate the tumor matrix and improve the distribution of an oncolytic virus throughout the tumor , without affect cell proliferation or viral replication .",
    "in addition , a previous work @xcite showed that the matrix metalloproteinase@xmath87 is antimetastatic , so it could be safely used to improve the viral diffusion in tumors .",
    "strategies that change the tumor microenvironment are specially important to enhance the efficacy of virotherapy against avascular tumors and occult dormant metastasis .    in summary ,",
    "the outcomes of oncolytic virotherapy on solid tumors were investigated through computer simulations of a multiscale model for cancer growth .",
    "the model combines macroscopic diffusion equations for the nutrients and stochastic rules for the actions of individual cells and viruses .",
    "our simulations reveal that in immunosuppressed hosts the antitumor efficacy of a virus is determined primarily by its efficiency of entry , its replicative capacity within the cancer cell , and its ability to spread over the tissue .",
    "however , the balance between these viral traits depends on the tumor morphology .",
    "indeed , the virotherapy of papillary tumors based on oncolytic viruses with small diffusivities is highly effective ( success probability @xmath88 ) even for small virus entry but high replication capacity .",
    "furthermore , the therapy fails if the virus both spreads and lysis infected cells very rapidly .",
    "in contrast , for compact tumors the therapy fails if vectors characterized by small virus entry and slow intratumoral spreading are used at safety @xmath53s . in turn , for diffuse tumors an intermediate viral diffusivity maximizes the therapeutic success .",
    "thereby , the design of efficient oncolytic viruses must take into account the dynamics of tumor growth , which is fast for compact but slow for papillary cancers .",
    "it is the tumor growth that sets up the optimal traits for oncolytic viruses .",
    "those traits do not necessarily include high diffusivity and cytolysis , which are naively assumed as necessary conditions to amplify the therapeutic inoculum _ in situ _ and promote a fast viral spreading throughout the affected tissue .",
    "this work is dedicated to the memory of our friend and collaborator in this enterprise professor marcelo jos vilela , recently dead by cancer .",
    "the authors would like to thanks the brazilian supporting agencies cnpq , capes and fapemig .",
    "the simulations were implemented as follows . at each time step , eq .",
    "( @xmath0 ) is numerically solved in the stationary state ( @xmath89 ) through relaxation methods .",
