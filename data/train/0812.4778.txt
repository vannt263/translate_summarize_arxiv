    "over the past decade , type ia supernovae have been used successfully as standard candles to facilitate the acquisition of several important cosmological parameters . on the basis of this work ,",
    "it is now widely believed that the universe s expansion is accelerating.@xmath6 in standard cosmology , built on the assumption of spatial homogeneity and isotropy , such an expansion requires the existence of a third form of energy , beyond the basic admixture of ( visible and dark ) matter and radiation .",
    "one may see this directly from the ( cosmological ) friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) differential equations of motion , usually written as @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 in which an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath5 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent , respectively , the total energy density and total pressure . in these expressions , @xmath12 is the expansion factor , and @xmath13 are the coordinates in the comoving frame .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is @xmath15 for a closed universe , @xmath16 for a flat universe , and @xmath17 for an open universe .",
    "following convention , we write the equation of state as @xmath18 . a quick inspection of eq .",
    "( 2 ) shows that an accelerated expansion ( @xmath19 ) requires @xmath20 .",
    "thus , neither radiation ( @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ) , nor ( visible and dark ) matter ( @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ) can satisfy this condition , leading to the supposition that a third ` dark ' component @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) of the energy density @xmath10 must be present . in principle , each of these contributions to @xmath10 evolves according to its own dependence on @xmath12 .    over the past few years",
    ", complementary measurements@xmath27 of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have indicated that the universe is flat ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) , so @xmath10 is at ( or very near ) the  critical \" density @xmath29 . but among the many peculiarities of the standard model is the inference , based on current observations , that @xmath25 must itself be of order @xmath30 .",
    "dark energy is often thought to be the manifestation of a cosmological constant , @xmath31 , though no reasonable explanation has yet been offered as to why such a fixed , universal density ought to exist at this scale .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath31 is associated with the energy of the vacuum in quantum theory , it should have a scale representative of phase transitions in the early universe  many , many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath30 .",
    "many authors have attempted to circumvent these difficulties by proposing alternative forms of dark energy , including quintessence,@xmath32 which represents an evolving canonical scalar field with an inflation - inducing potential , a chameleon field@xmath33 in which the scalar field couples to the baryon energy density and varies from solar system to cosmological scales , and modified gravity , arising out of both string motivated , or general relativity modified actions,@xmath34 which introduce large length scale corrections modifying the late time evolution of the universe .",
    "the actual number of suggested remedies is far greater than this small , illustrative sample .",
    "nonetheless , though many in the cosmology community suspect that some sort of dynamics is responsible for the appearance of dark energy , until now the sensitivity of current observations has been deemed insufficient@xmath35 to distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of a time - independent cosmological constant @xmath31 .",
    "this conclusion , however , appears to be premature , given that constraints on the universe s expansion arising from the observed behavior of our cosmic horizon has not yet been fully folded into the interrogation of the current data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a closer scrutiny of the available measurements , if proven to be reliable , can in fact already delineate between evolving and constant dark energy theories , and that a simple cosmological constant @xmath31 , characterized by a fixed @xmath36 , is disfavored by the observations .",
    "in an earlier paper,@xmath37 we introduced a transformation of the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric ( from which eqs .  1 , 2 , and 3 are derived ) into a new set of ( observer - dependent ) coordinates @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the time ( in the observer s frame ) corresponding to the radius @xmath41 .",
    "the cosmic time @xmath5 coincides with @xmath42 only at the origin , i.e. , @xmath43 . for all other radii ,",
    "@xmath42 is dilated relative to @xmath5 from the effects of curvature induced by the mass - energy content of the universe .",
    "ironically , de sitter s own metric was first written in terms of these observer - dependent coordinates,@xmath44 @xmath45c^2\\,dt^2- { dr^2\\over 1-\\left({r / r_{\\rm h}}\\right)^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] but this appears to have long since been forgotten , and everyone now uses the form of the metric written in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath5 only : @xmath47\\;.\\ ] ]    however , it is easy to see why it makes sense to consider both sets of coordinates , because written in terms of @xmath38 , the rw metric explicitly reveals the dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath49 on the characteristic radius @xmath0 , defined by the condition @xmath50 in this expression , @xmath51 is the enclosed mass at @xmath0 . in terms of @xmath10 , we find that @xmath52 or , more simply , @xmath53 in a flat universe .",
    "not surprisingly , this is the radius at which a sphere encloses sufficient mass - energy to create an infinite redshift ( i.e. , @xmath54 as @xmath55 ) as seen by an observer at the origin of the coordinates @xmath38 .",
    "when the robertson - walker metric is written in terms of @xmath38 , the presence of @xmath0 alters the intervals of time we measure ( using the clocks fixed to our origin ) progressively more and more as @xmath55 . and",
    "since the gravitational time dilation becomes infinite at @xmath0 , it is physically impossible for us to see any process occurring beyond this radius .",
    "light emitted beyond @xmath0 is infinitely redshifted by the time it reaches us and it therefore carries no signal .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the recent observations have a profound impact on our view of the cosmos .",
    "the hubble space telescope key project on the extragalactic distance scale has measured the hubble constant @xmath56 with unprecedented accuracy,@xmath57 yielding a current value @xmath58 km s@xmath59 mpc@xmath59 .",
    "( for @xmath56 and @xmath5 , we will use subscript  0 \" to denote cosmological values pertaining to the current epoch . ) with this @xmath60 , we infer that @xmath61 ergs @xmath62 .    given such precision , it is now possible to accurately calculate the radius @xmath0 . from the hubble measurement of @xmath63 ,",
    "we infer that @xmath64 billion light - years ; this is the maximum distance out to which measurements of the cosmic parameters may be made at the present time . at first glance , it may seem that it had to be this way , since the age @xmath2 of the universe is also known to be @xmath65 billion years .",
    "but in fact , the frw equations predict that @xmath0 should _ not _ be equal to @xmath66 , unless @xmath67 has a very special value .",
    "let us consider how the radius @xmath0 evolves with the universal expansion .",
    "clearly , in a de sitter universe@xmath44 with a constant @xmath10 ( proportional to @xmath31 ) , @xmath0 is fixed forever .",
    "coincides with the event horizon defined by rindler.@xmath68 but for any universe with @xmath69 , @xmath0 must be a function of time . from the definition of @xmath0 and eqn .",
    "( 3 ) , it is easy to see that @xmath70 a remarkably simple expression that nonetheless leads to several important conclusions regarding our cosmological measurements .",
    "we will use it here to distinguish between constant and evolving dark energy theories .",
    "notice , for example , that @xmath71 only for the special case @xmath72 , which is not consistent with the currently favored @xmath31cdm model of cosmology .    take @xmath5 to be some time in the distant past ( so that @xmath73 ) .",
    "then , integrating eqn .",
    "( 8) from @xmath5 to @xmath2 , we find that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the time - averaged value of @xmath67 from @xmath5 to the present time .    now ,",
    "for any @xmath76 , @xmath10 drops as the universe expands ( i.e. , as @xmath12 increases with time ) , and since @xmath77 , clearly @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , @xmath79 the reason we can use the behavior of @xmath0 as the universe expands to probe the nature of dark energy is that the latter directly impacts the value of @xmath80 .",
    "a consideration of how the cosmic horizon @xmath0 evolves with time can therefore reveal whether or not dark energy is dynamically generated .",
    "indeed , we shall see shortly that the current observations , together with eqn .",
    "( 11 ) , are already quite sufficient for us to differentiate between the various models .    before we do that , however , we can already see from this expression that there may be a serious problem with our interpretation of @xmath2 in the standard model of cosmology . from wmap observations,@xmath27",
    "we infer that the age @xmath2 of the universe is @xmath81 billion years .",
    "since @xmath64 billion light - years , this can only occur if @xmath82 .",
    "of course , this means that the existence of dark energy ( with such an equation of state ) is required by the wmap and hubble observations alone , independently of the type ia supernova data .",
    "but an analysis of the latter ( see   4 below , particularly figs .  5 and 8) reveals that the value @xmath83 is apparently ruled out , so in fact @xmath84 .",
    "but this means that @xmath85 ; in fact , @xmath0 must be less than @xmath66 , which in turns suggests that the universe is older than we think .",
    "unless @xmath72 , what we infer to be the time since the big bang , is instead the  horizon \" time @xmath86 , which must be shorter than @xmath2 .",
    "this may seem absurd at first , but we must remember that any events occurring beyond @xmath0 are not visible to us yet ( or ever , depending on whether or not @xmath0 is constant ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath40 becomes progressively more dilated as we view events taking place closer and closer to @xmath0 , so that we see the universe as it appeared just after the big bang when @xmath87 , regardless of when the big bang actually occurred , as long as @xmath88 .",
    "this phenomenon has some important consequences that may resolve several long - standing conflicts in cosmology . through our analysis",
    "below , we will gain a better understanding of how it works , which will permit us to calculate @xmath2 more precisely .",
    "the standard model of cosmology contains a mixture of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant with an energy density fixed at the current value , @xmath89 , and an equation of state with @xmath90 .",
    "known as @xmath31cdm , this model has been reasonably successful in accounting for large scale structure , the cosmic microwave background fluctuations , and several other observed cosmological properties.@xmath91    but let us now see whether @xmath31cdm is also consistent with our understanding of @xmath0 .",
    "putting @xmath92 , where @xmath23 is the time - dependent matter energy density , we may integrate eqn .",
    "( 8) for a @xmath31cdm cosmology , starting at the present time @xmath2 , and going backwards towards the era when radiation dominated @xmath10 ( somewhere around 100,000 years after the big bang ) .",
    "1 shows the run of @xmath93 as a function of time , along with the time - averaged @xmath67 given in eqn .",
    "( 10 ) , to be distinguished from the asymptotic value @xmath94 , which is the equation - of - state parameter @xmath67 averaged over the entire universal expansion , from @xmath95 to the present .",
    "the present epoch is indicated by a vertical dotted line .",
    "the calculation begins at the present time @xmath2 , with the initial value @xmath96 , where @xmath94 is obtained by an iterative convergence of the solution to eqn .",
    "in order to have @xmath97 at the present time , @xmath94 must be ( @xmath98 ) . in @xmath31cdm , the matter density increases towards the big bang , but @xmath99 is constant , so the impact of @xmath100 on the solution vanishes as @xmath101 ( see the dashed curve in fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , as expected , @xmath102 early in the universe s development .",
    "this is the correct behavior within the framework of the friedman - robertson - walker cosmology .",
    "what is rather striking about this result is that in @xmath31cdm , @xmath3 approaches @xmath4 only once in the entire history of the universe  and this is only because we have imposed this requirement as an initial condition on our solution .",
    "there are many peculiarities in the standard model , some of which we will encounter shortly , but the unrealistic coincidence that @xmath0 should approach @xmath66 only at the present moment must certainly rank at  or near  the top of this list .    one may be tempted to think of this result as another manifestation of the so - called  coincidence problem \" in @xmath31cdm cosmology , arising from the peculiar near - simultaneous convergence of @xmath23 and @xmath99 towards @xmath30 in the present epoch . but these are definitely not the same phenomenon . whether or not @xmath23 and @xmath99 are similar , the requirement that @xmath103 only at @xmath2 implies a very special evolution of these quantities as functions of cosmic time @xmath5 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this odd behavior casts doubt on the viability of @xmath31cdm cosmology as the correct description of the universe .",
    "given the broad range of alternative theories of dark energy that are still considered to be viable , it is beyond the scope of this paper to exhaustively study all dynamical scenarios .",
    "instead , we shall focus on a class of solutions with particular importance to cosmology  those in which the energy density of the scalar field mimics the background fluid energy density .",
    "cosmological models in this category are known as  scaling solutions , \" characterized by the relation @xmath104 ( some of the early papers on this topic include refs .",
    "1825 ) .    by far the simplest cosmology",
    "we can imagine in this class is that for which @xmath72 , corresponding to @xmath105 ( within the errors ) .",
    "this model is conceptually very attractive , but does not appear to be fully consistent with type ia supernova data , so either our interpretation of current observations is wrong or the universe just does nt work this way .",
    "but it s worth our while spending some time with it because it will help us understand the models that follow it .    to begin with",
    ", we see immediately from eqn .",
    "( 8) ( and illustrated in figs .  3 and 4 ) that when @xmath72 , we have @xmath106 .",
    "thus , for a scaling solution satisfying eqn .",
    "( 12 ) , this value of @xmath67 solves three of the major problems in standard cosmology : first , it explains why @xmath107 should be equal to @xmath66 ( because these quantities are always equal ) .",
    "second , it removes the inexplicable coincidence that @xmath25 and @xmath23 should be comparable to each other only in the present epoch ( since they are always comparable to each other ) .",
    "third , it does away with the so - called flatness problem . to see this ,",
    "let us return momentarily to eqn .",
    "( 1 ) and rewrite it as follows : @xmath108 whether or not the universe is asymptotically flat hinges on the behavior of @xmath109 as @xmath110 . but from the definition of @xmath0 ( eqn .",
    "7 ) , we infer that @xmath111 thus , if @xmath72 , @xmath112 and so @xmath113 which is the equation for a flat universe .",
    "( we caution , however , that in deriving this result , we have used eqns .  8 and 11 , which implicitly assume a flat universe , together with eqn .  13 which is more general .",
    "if a scaling solution proves to be the likely representation of dark energy , then a demonstration of flatness would need to be shown more rigorously . ) we also learn from eqn .",
    "( 2 ) that in this universe , @xmath114 .",
    "the universe is coasting , but not because it is empty , as in the milne cosmology,@xmath115 but rather because the change in pressure as it expands is just right to balance the change in its energy density .",
    "all told , these are quite impressive accomplishments for such a simple model , and yet , it does nt appear to be fully consistent with type ia supernova data .",
    "it is quite straightforward to demonstrate this with the evolutionary profiles shown in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "the comoving coordinate distance from some time @xmath5 in the past to the present is @xmath116 . with @xmath28 ,",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath117 is @xmath118 , where the redshift @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 , in terms of the expansion factor @xmath12 plotted in fig .",
    "4 .    the data in fig .  5",
    "are taken from the  gold \" sample,@xmath121 with coverage in redshift from @xmath16 to @xmath1221.8 .",
    "the distance modulus is @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .",
    "the dashed curve in this plot represents the fit based on the scaling solution shown in figs .  3 and 4 , with a hubble constant @xmath125 km s@xmath59 mpc@xmath59 (",
    "@xmath126 is used as a free optimization parameter in each of figs .  5 and 8) .",
    "best \" match corresponds to an unacceptable reduced @xmath127 of @xmath128 with @xmath129 d.o.f .",
    "interestingly , if we were to find a slight systematic error in the distance modulus for the events at @xmath130 , which for some reason has led to a fractional over - estimation in their distance ( or , conversely , a systematic error that has lead to an under - estimation of the distance modulus for the nearby explosions ) , the fit would improve significantly .",
    "so our tentative conclusion right now must be that , although an elegant scaling solution with @xmath72 provides a much better explanation than @xmath31cdm for the observed coincidence @xmath131 , it is nonetheless still not fully consistent with the supernova data .",
    "fortunately , many of the attractive features of an @xmath72 cosmology are preserved in the case where @xmath132 , corresponding to a scaling solution with @xmath133 .",
    "this model fits the supernova data quite strikingly , but it comes at an additional cost  we would have to accept the fact that the universe is somewhat older ( by a few billion years ) than we now believe . actually , this situation is unavoidable for any cosmology with @xmath20 because of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath66 in eqn .  ( 11 ) .",
    "this conclusion may seem incompatible with the wmap and hst data , but is actually fully consistent with them , though our _ interpretation _ of the currently inferred  age \" of 13.7 billion years would need to be revised along the following lines .",
    "light reaching us from beyond the cosmic horizon ( at radius @xmath0 ) is infinitely redshifted , so only phenomena occurring within a time @xmath86 of the present can produce a measurable signal in our instruments .",
    "of course , there is no _ a priori _ reason why the horizon time @xmath134 must coincide with the time @xmath2 elapsed since the big bang .",
    "we can say with certainty that @xmath2 can not be smaller than @xmath134 , for otherwise @xmath135 , which is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "however , a situation with @xmath136 simply means that the universe has been expanding longer than the time it has taken the observed cmb to reach us from @xmath0 . as noted earlier , this situation can not be avoided for any scenario in which @xmath20 .",
    "the case @xmath72 is special because then @xmath137 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "6 that @xmath93 is constant ( say when @xmath132 ) , but at a value @xmath138 , where the time - averaged @xmath67 is now @xmath139 .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is 13.5 billion light - years , @xmath2 must be approximately 16.9 billion years .",
    "this is simply a manifestation of the fact that anything that happened between the big bang and a horizon time @xmath134 ago would have produced infinitely redshifted signals at the present time , and is no longer observable .",
    "thus , we can see only as far back as @xmath134 , and if @xmath20 , we must therefore re - interpret the presently inferred  age \" as the horizon time @xmath134 , not the universe s true age @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "6 , the distinction between @xmath134 and @xmath2 is indicated primarily through the termination points of the @xmath0 and @xmath80 curves , which extend past the vertical dotted line at @xmath140 .",
    "ironically , this unexpected result has several important consequences , such as offering an explanation for the early appearance of supermassive black holes@xmath141 ( at a redshift @xmath142 ) , and the glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group.@xmath143 both of these long - standing problems in cosmology would be resolved if the universe were older .",
    "supermassive black holes would have had much more time ( @xmath144 billion years ) to form than current thinking allows ( i.e. , only @xmath145 million years ) , and dwarf halos would correspondingly have had more time to merge hierarchically , depleting the lower mass end of the distribution .",
    "the matter and dark energy densities corresponding to the @xmath132 scaling solution are shown as functions of cosmic time in fig .  7 , along with the evolution of the scale factor @xmath12",
    ". here too , the  coincidence problem \" does not exist , and the flatness problem is resolved since @xmath146 as a result of eqn .",
    "( 14 ) , so that @xmath147 as @xmath110 in eqn .  ( 13 ) .",
    "thus , the constant in eqn .",
    "( 16 ) should be @xmath148 at late times , regardless of the value of @xmath14 .",
    "very importantly , this model fits the type ia supernova data very well , as shown in fig .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath149 , with a reduced @xmath150 for @xmath129 d.o.f .",
    "our main goal in this study has been to examine what we can learn about the nature of dark energy from a consideration of the cosmic horizon @xmath0 and its evolution with cosmic time .",
    "a principal outcome of this work is the realization that the so - called  coincidence \" problem in the standard model is actually more severe than previously thought .",
    "we have found that in a @xmath31cdm universe , @xmath151 only once , and according to the observations , this must be happening right now .",
    "the unlikelihood of this occurrence is an indication that dark energy almost certainly is not due to a cosmological constant .",
    "other issues that have already been discussed extensively in the literature , such as the fact that the vacuum energy in quantum theory should greatly exceed the required value of @xmath31 , only make this argument even more compelling . of course , this rejection of the cosmological - constant hypothesis then intensifies interest into the question of why we do nt see any vacuum energy at all , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "many alternatives to a cosmological constant have been proposed over the past decade but , for the sake of simplicity , we have chosen in this paper to focus our attention on scaling solutions .",
    "the existence of such cosmologies has been discussed extensively in the literature , within the context of standard general relativity , braneworlds ( randall - sundrum and gauss - bonnett ) , and cardassian scenarios , among others.@xmath152    our study has shown that scaling solutions fit the type ia supernova data at least as well as the basic @xmath31cdm cosmology , but they go farther in simultaneously solving several conundrums with the standard model .",
    "as long as the time - averaged value of @xmath67 is less than @xmath153 , they eliminate both the coincidence and flatness problems , possibly even obviating the need for a period of rapid inflation in the early universe.@xmath154    but most importantly , as far as this study is concerned , scaling solutions account very well for the observed fact that @xmath155 . if @xmath83 exactly , then @xmath106 for all cosmic time , and therefore the fact that we see this condition in the present universe is no coincidence at all . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath84 , scaling solutions fit the type ia supernova data even better , but then we have to accept the conclusion that the universe is older than the horizon time @xmath86 . according to our calculations , which produce a best fit to the supernova data for @xmath156 ( corresponding to a dark energy equation of state with @xmath132 ) , the age of the universe should then be @xmath157 billion years .",
    "this may be surprising at first , but the fact of the matter is that such an age actually solves other major problems in cosmology , including the ( too ) early appearance of supermassive black holes , and the glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group of galaxies .",
    "when thinking about a dynamical dark energy , it is worth recalling that scalar fields arise frequently in particle physics , including string theory , and any of these may be appropriate candidates for this mysterious new component of @xmath10 . actually ,",
    "though we have restricted our discussion to equations of state with @xmath158 , it may even turn out that a dark energy with @xmath159 is providing the universe s acceleration .",
    "such a field is usually referred to as a phantom or a ghost . the simplest explanation for this form of dark energy would be a scalar field with a negative kinetic energy.@xmath160 however , phantom fields are plagued by severe quantum instabilities ,",
    "since their energy density is unbounded from below and the vacuum may acquire normal , positive energy fields.@xmath161 we have therefore not included theories with @xmath159 in our analysis here , though a further consideration of their viability may be warranted as the data continue to improve .    on the observational front , the prospects for confirming or rejecting some of the ideas presented in this paper look very promising indeed .",
    "an eagerly anticipated mission , snap,@xmath162 will constrain the nature of dark energy in two ways .",
    "first , it will observe deeper type ia supernovae .",
    "second , it will attempt to use weak gravitational lensing to probe foreground mass structures .",
    "if selected , snap should be launched by 2020 .",
    "the planck cmb satellite , an already funded mission , probably wo nt have the sensitivity to measure any evolution in @xmath100 , but it may be able to tell us whether or not @xmath163 .    finally , we may be on the verge of uncovering a class of sources other than type ia supernovae to use for dark - energy exploration .",
    "type ia supernovae have greatly enhanced our ability to study the universe s expansion out to a redshift @xmath164 .",
    "but this new class of sources may possibly extend this range to values as high as 510 . according to ref .",
    "39 , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) have the potential to detect dark energy with a reasonable significance , particularly if there was an appreciable amount of it at early times , as suggested by scaling solutions .",
    "it is still too early to tell if grbs are good standard candles , but since differences between @xmath31cdm and dynamical dark energy scenarios are more pronounced at early times ( see figs .  5 and 8) , grbs may in the long run turn out to be even more important than type ia supernovae in helping us learn about the true nature of this unexpected  third \" form of energy .",

    "<S> within the context of standard cosmology , an accelerating universe requires the presence of a third ` dark ' component of energy , beyond matter and radiation . the available data , however , are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of a time - independent cosmological constant . in this paper , we examine the cosmological expansion in terms of observer - dependent coordinates , in addition to the more conventional co - moving coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure explicitly reveals the role played by the radius @xmath0 of our cosmic horizon in the interrogation of the data . </S>",
    "<S> ( in rindler s notation , @xmath0 coincides with the ` event horizon ' in the case of de sitter , but changes in time for other cosmologies that also contain matter and/or radiation . ) with this approach , we show that the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant is clearly disfavored by the observations . within the framework of standard friedman - robertson - walker cosmology </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an equation describing the evolution of @xmath0 , and solve it using the wmap and type ia supernova data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider the meaning of the _ observed _ equality ( or near equality ) @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the age of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this empirical result is far from trivial , for a cosmological constant would drive @xmath3 towards @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the cosmic time ) only once  and that would have to occur right now . though we are not here espousing any particular alternative model of dark energy , for comparison we also consider scenarios in which dark energy is given by scaling solutions , which simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model , including the ` coincidence ' and ` flatness ' problems , and account very well for the fact that @xmath1 . </S>"
