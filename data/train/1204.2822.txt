    "in spite of the prevalence and importance of omnivory food webs @xcite in natural communities their population dynamics to date remain poorly understood , even for only three species in the community . even in simple systems a plethora of nonlinear effects such as flexible consumer behaviour @xcite , intraspecific interactions between competing consumers and resources @xcite , inhomogeneity of the environment @xcite and adaptive foraging @xcite precludes easy theoretical treatment and interpretation .",
    "one example of a non - trivial omnivory food web is a system with intraguild predation @xcite .",
    "intraguild predation assumes that the same organism is both competitor and predator to another member of the food web .",
    "the igp models encompass a rich dynamical behaviour including coexistence @xcite and alternative stable states @xcite .",
    "simple mathematical models @xcite have been evoked in attempt to explain the persistence of igp interactions in natural habitats .",
    "however predictions from the mathematical theory of 3-species igp systems state that a high resource carrying capacity promotes the exclusion of intermediate trophic levels and thus destabilizes interactions @xcite .",
    "what is puzzling that various empirical studies of omnivory document however coexistence , but not exclusion , over the entire range of natural resource productivities @xcite . on the basis of experimental observations a theoretical 3-species omnivory model @xcite predicts the coexistence only at superior competitive abilities of the ig prey for the communal resource @xcite . yet",
    "empirical data suggest a robust persistence of igp systems in both terrestrial @xcite and aquatic communities @xcite .",
    "theoretical models that are focused on the aspects of stability and coexistence of species in 3-level systems with the igp @xcite , as a rule , largely reduce the complexity of interactions observed in realistic systems @xcite .",
    "such oversimplifications can influence the population dynamics as well as critically impact species persistence .",
    "even though the simplest model of the igp encompasses only three species @xcite a number of empirical studies deal with larger food webs that involve more than three species potentially engaged in igp interactions @xcite .",
    "spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the environment often is invoked as one of the explanatory mechanisms for the coexistence between multiple species competing for the same resources @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that such a spatiotemporal heterogeneity can affect the diversity in prey populations @xcite .",
    "indeed an inhomogeneity in prey items that share common resource and predators is critical in determining the responses of ecological community . for systems with multiple prey composition various coexistence patterns can be found depending on the levels of resource productivity  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear yet how the diversity in a prey community will affect the behaviour in the igp systems .",
    "the effect of a habitat structure on the igp is discussed in various recent models @xcite .",
    "for example a stable coexistence of the intraguild prey due to inhomogeneity of a habitat can be supported by creating temporal refuges for prey and reducing the encounter rates among preys and predators @xcite .",
    "in addition the stability of the igp can be enhanced by an inclusion of additional factors such as behaviourally mediated effects @xcite .    to include the effect of an increasing diversity of resource and ig predators on population dynamics recently the 3-species igp model @xcite",
    "was modified by holt and huxel ( 2007 ) .",
    "the authors extended the basic 3-species omnivory model to the so called `` partial igp '' model in which `` partial '' overlap among competitors for a single resource exists and both predators have exclusive resources to exploit .",
    "it was shown @xcite that an alternative resource enhances the tolerance of the ig prey against attacks from ig predators .",
    "independently of a competitive status of the ig prey in exploitation for a shared resource it can persists by utilizing an alternative resource . an extended formulation of the igp model with trophic supplementation has been proposed by daugherty et al .",
    "the authors investigated three forms of a supplementary feeding outside of the basic igp module and postulated a higher potential for persistence of the ig prey due to its efficient exploitation of external resources .",
    "there is growing evidence that in many systems the ig prey has a mutualistic or at least facilitative relationship with the ig predator @xcite . including such facilitation in ecological theory will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will enable a better understanding of functioning of many natural communities @xcite .    especially in the igp systems",
    "an emphasis should be given to the elucidation of the effects of facilitation on community composition and stability @xcite .",
    "contrary to the competitive exclusion principle in systems with competitors for a single resource stability stems from commensalism @xcite .",
    "hereby one consumer can in some way alter the habitat to benefit the other .",
    "recently such an interaction was observed in experiments with a microzooplankton food web community @xcite .",
    "the experimental system included two predators : a tintinnid species _",
    "favella ehrenbergii _ and a heterotrophic dinoflagellate species _",
    "gyrodinium dominans_. they are both grazing on a phototrophic dinoflagellate _",
    "scrippsiella trochoidea_. the authors showed that the ig predator _",
    "f. ehrenbergii _ can precondition a substantial part of the common resource _",
    "s. trochoidea _ during its feeding procedure by immobilizing the common prey without ingestion .",
    "such preconditioned individuals can be captured more easily by the ig prey _",
    "g. dominans _ than the mobile individuals of the same resource species .",
    "this mutualistic interaction leads to higher growth rates of the ig prey in the presence of the ig predator .",
    "the authors characterized their experimental observations as a facilitative igp relationship with a commensalistic pattern .",
    "our motivation for this modeling study was to investigate if such commensalistic patterns can create loopholes for a stable coexistence of all species in the investigated system .",
    "of our major interest was if in the igp system an immobilization @xcite or the partitioning of prey populations into distinct groups of individuals offers opportunities for competition avoidance among both consumer species .",
    "we reformulated the 3-species igp model proposed in @xcite to include multiple subpopulations of prey .",
    "furthermore , we explored the effect of diversification of the resource available to higher level consumers on the species persistence by numerical simulations of an extended igp module .",
    "specifically , we investigate how the addition of new links to a focal igp module enhances stability of population dynamics by reducing the competitive interactions of predators for their shared resource .    in order to explain the results of the experimental findings of leder et al .",
    "we investigated the influence of multiple traits of the resource community on a stable coexistence in the 3-species model with different types of resource .",
    "for this purpose we adapted and reformulated the original model by holt and polis ( 1997 ) and added a new type of interaction .",
    "this link specifies the immobilization mechanism that depends on the densities of mobile and immobile resource items and the top predator which creates the immobile resource fraction during feeding .",
    "the immobilization term is used to model the interactions between the ig predator and the resource .",
    "another type of interaction considered in this paper is a resource turnover mechanism .",
    "this mechanism describes mutual interactions between species from distinct resource subpopulations .",
    "the interaction term depends exclusively on the resource subpopulation densities .",
    "the rate of turnover is constant . if no turnover or immobilization of individuals from one group to another occurs then the basic igp model with a single population of resource is recovered .",
    "we discuss the influence of immobilization and transfer of species on the coexistence patterns in a system with different subpopulations of the resource and compare the results with the basic 3-species igp .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the first section we introduce a general 3-species igp model with a new type of interaction that links the resource pools to the top consumers . in the following sections two distinct igp formulations with @xmath0 resource subpopulations are discussed .",
    "both models are derived from the basic igp module by including additional links : @xmath1 the immobilization by the predator and @xmath2 the resource turnover . in the results section",
    "we numerically investigate stability of equilibrium densities for various trophic configurations .",
    "data from numerical analysis are presented for the igp model with the immobilization and for the model with the resource turnover .",
    "at last we discuss results for a general igp model with the resource turnover mechanism and @xmath3 subpopulations of the resource . after sketching the main conclusions we review the model predictions and compare their relevance to the immobilization experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore we discuss possible alternative reformulations of the model . in the appendix explicit forms for the steady states for two simple analytical cases and multidimensional system are specified . as a part of a linear stability routine the jacobian matrices for two types of formulations",
    "are given .",
    "finally , we carry over to a higher dimensional formulation and describe the parameters choice and the equilibrium densities .",
    "we introduce an omnivory model with an igp unit derived from a simple non - spatial lotka - volterra system with the linear functional responses adapted from holt and polis ( 1997 ) .",
    "the original model consists of populations of two predators ( ig predator and ig prey ) and a common resource . here",
    ", we include new features such as a resource differentiation mechanism which affects palatability of a fraction of resource for the predators .",
    "specifically , the entire resource population is subdivided into distinct groups under the assumption that the groups differ from each other by the quality and fitness of the individuals .",
    "they are consumed by the predators at different group - specific grazing rates .",
    "the differentiation of the resource could be due to damage by the predator or initial inhomogeneous distribution of the resource quality .",
    "afterwards , we generalize our model to the case of the multiple resources .    the food web model for a multiple number of prey subpopulations @xmath4 is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  a. the top predator @xmath5 and the intermediate predator @xmath6 are engaged in the igp and share a common resource @xmath7 .",
    "the resource pools are not independent because there is an exchange of individuals among different subpopulations @xmath8 following the links in fig .",
    "another special case of the igp with two distinct populations of resource @xmath9 and @xmath10 is presented in fig .",
    "shown is a schematic view of trophic interactions including intraguild predation and two populations @xmath10 and @xmath9 of immobilized and mobile resources respectively .",
    "the ig prey @xmath6 competes with the ig predator @xmath5 for both resource types and is also an additional resource for the ig predator .",
    "the size of the population @xmath10 increases due to immobilization of individuals from the population @xmath9 by the ig predator @xmath5 .",
    "we begin with an overview of a general igp model and all the important trophic links and parameters that are used to define it .",
    "later we focus specifically on two different formulations of the general igp model .",
    "the general model for a food web with an inhomogeneous resource is derived from the lotka - volterra omnivory model @xcite with the interaction term that accounts for the transitions among different pools .",
    "the lotka - volterra omnivory model consists of @xmath11 equations .",
    "it is used as an approximation for the food web community with the igp and @xmath12 mutually interacting subpopulations of the resources . in the absence of predation a basal population @xmath7 develops according to logistic growth @xcite .",
    "the set of equations for the population densities are written as follows :     _ shared @xmath13st resource _ : @xmath14 s_1\\nonumber\\\\ & & -z_1(s_1,s_2,\\ldots , s_n , g , f),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ shared @xmath15th resource ( @xmath16 ) _ : @xmath17 s_k,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ intermediate predator ( ig prey ) _ : @xmath18 _ top predator ( ig predator ) _ : @xmath19    the parameters of the model and main populations are described in details in table  [ tab1 ] . here",
    "@xmath20 is the maximum specific growth rate of the resource population @xmath7 , @xmath21 is the carrying capacity of the resource defined as enrichment factor in the previous models @xcite .",
    "the subpopulations @xmath8 are derived from the basal resource @xmath7 via immobilization or via individual - to - individual turnover .",
    "species from @xmath7 and @xmath22 are consumed by the ig predator at potentially different rates @xmath23 and @xmath24 and by the ig prey at rates @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the differentiation among subpopulations @xmath8 is preserved by a choice of distinct predation pressures @xmath27 , feeding rates @xmath28 and mortality coefficients @xmath29 .",
    "the density - independent mortality rates for @xmath30 and @xmath5 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspondingly .",
    "they are used as factors limiting the growth of the populations in ( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "a key assumption of the model is that there is only one - directional movement between the basal resource @xmath7 and its fractions @xmath22 .",
    "the local interactions among individuals from alternative pools are embedded via functional terms @xmath33 provided in table  [ tab2 ] for each type of the igp formulation .",
    "these terms account for transitions among the resource items @xmath22 .",
    "the general omnivory model ( [ eq.1 ] ) can be reduced to three types of igp formulations : system with immobilization and systems with the resource turnover for @xmath0 subpopulations and for @xmath3 pools . for each of the formulations",
    "specific expressions of functional forms @xmath34 and @xmath35 are provided in the table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the term @xmath36 is responsible for the exchange of individuals among subpopulations @xmath37 due to the species turnover or the immobilization mechanism .",
    "the transfer of individuals from the population @xmath7 to @xmath8 happens instantaneously at constant rates @xmath38 correspondingly .",
    "analogously @xmath39 are defined as instantaneous migration rates among subpopulations @xmath8 .",
    "the terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 are used to evaluate the total predation of the ig prey and the ig predator on the resource .    to achieve a stable persistence of all species",
    "the ig prey should benefit more from an alternative resource than the ig predator .",
    "for this reason , whereas the attack rates of the ig predator are equal for different resource pools , the ig prey establishes a higher predation pressure on subpopulations @xmath22 than on the basal pool @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical values for the attack rates are chosen to be close to the experimentally observed values @xcite .",
    "holt and huxel ( 2007 ) used an extended igp module with alternative resources that are defined independently .",
    "they evolve according to their own intrinsic growth rates .",
    "as opposed to the formulation given by holt and huxel ( 2007 ) and to a model with trophic supplements @xcite here we do not consider external alternative resources . in our model with immobilization the population density in every resource pool varies due to immobilization by the ig predator and consumption by the predators .",
    "similarly in the formulation with the resource turnover the transfer mechanism between resource subpopulations plays a role in exchange among the distinct resource pools .",
    "alternative pools grow due to the influx of species from the basal resource or the other pools .",
    "therefore the sizes of subpopulations are controlled mainly by a number of direct encounters with the ig predator ( immobilization ) or by a species turnover from one resource subpopulation to another .",
    "in addition , the individuals in the different pools of the basal resource are distinguished by group - specific predation pressures that establish a top - down regulation of densities of each subpopulation .    in the following sections we present an explicit formulation of the model with immobilization and of the model with the resource turnover for @xmath0 subpopulations .

    "[ fig1 ]  b is derived from the equations ( [ eq.1 ] ) for two resource subpopulations by substituting the interaction terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 from table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "note that the feeding rates of the top predator @xmath5 on both populations @xmath10 and @xmath9 are equal .",
    "by contrast , the attack rate of the ig prey on immobilized subpopulation is higher than on mobile species .",
    "the relation @xmath48 holds in the presence and in the absence of the predator @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption is well justified by the observations of an experiment with artificial immobilization @xcite . _ g. dominans _ demonstrate a strongly selective behaviour towards immobilized species when offered in a mixture with mobile cells of _ s. trochoidea_. it was measured that ingestion rates of the predator in the immobilized prey treatment were by a factor of @xmath49 greater than those in the control treatment .",
    "the stability of equilibrium densities and the persistence zones of the system  ( [ eq.2 ] ) with a non - zero immobilization rate are discussed in section  [ sec.3.1 ] .        the model with the resource turnover",
    "is derived from the general case  ( [ eq.1 ] ) by substituting the functional forms from table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "note that the evolution equations are written as in  ( [ eq.2 ] ) but immobilization term is replaced with the transfer term that is dependent on the population densities .",
    "the transfer between the two subpopulations occurs each time whenever species from two different pools encounter each other . in the simplest case",
    "the number of encounters is proportional to the population densities of @xmath7 and @xmath55 .",
    "if the density of second subpopulation is zero and no differentiation in the resource takes place at @xmath56 than the top predator @xmath5 outcompetes the predator @xmath6 due to a higher predation rate ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this outcome is predicted by the basic igp model @xcite . by contrast ,",
    "whenever the turnover of species takes place and non - zero densities are produced in the resource pool @xmath55 the intraguild predation introduces a higher pressure on the second subpopulation @xmath55 .",
    "this will potentially lead to a negative effect on the population density in @xmath55 and to higher levels of subpopulation @xmath7 .",
    "the result of this interaction is that the 3-species coexistence is reached via the igp competition trade - off .",
    "we illustrate an emergent dynamical behaviour for the three formulations provided in table  [ tab3 ] with stability diagrams . due to high dimensionality of the models ( [ eq.1])-([eq.3 ] )",
    "the analysis of an entire parameter space is intractable .",
    "only several illustrative examples for every formulation will be shown here .      in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the regions of stable positive equilibrium solutions versus immobilization and enrichment are shown .",
    "the parameter space is partitioned into several stability zones associated with the regions of coexistence , exclusion of both predators and exclusion of the ig prey at @xmath58 .",
    "the boundaries defined for partitioning of the diagram are found from the eigenvalue analysis ( see appendix ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] at low enrichment the densities of both predators decay to zero and the summed abundance of the resource reaches steady state at @xmath59 .",
    "the case of zero immobilization has been already considered in previous studies @xcite . at low immobilization and at high enrichment",
    "only the top predator and resource are stable and positive , just as in the 3-species igp model @xcite , whereas the coexistence between both predators and common resource is possible only in the regions of intermediate enrichment . a higher mortality rate for the predator @xmath6 results in its extinction in the region of low immobilization in fig .  [ fig2]b where an extra resource can no longer support its persistence .",
    "only the ig predator and resource persist in this region of parameters .",
    "situation is different for higher immobilization where a large region of coexistence for both predators exists .",

    "( [ eq.7 ] ) in appendix .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows equilibrium densities of the four components of the food web and their dependence on enrichment and immobilization rates .",
    "for a high immobilization rate the resource population is dominated by immobilized individuals . meanwhile at low immobilization mobile and immobilized populations increase along the gradient of enrichment",
    "an adverse pattern occurs at high immobilization .",
    "the growth rate of the ig predator is noticeably reduced at @xmath60 due to an increase of the competitive trade - off with the ig prey .",

    "meanwhile as predicted from the standard igp model @xcite the ig prey is excluded at high enrichment in the model with immobilization at @xmath61 the ig prey benefits from immobilized resource and its persistence is increased at a broader range of carrying capacities .",
    "the density of the mobile ( immobilized ) resource subpopulation reach saturation threshold at a higher enrichment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .                     how sensitive is a stable coexistence to small variations of the attack rates of the intermediate predator @xmath6 ?",
    "will our predictions be still valid ? to examine the system behaviour for different attack rates of @xmath6 the coexistence zones are exemplified for different values of @xmath25 in fig .",
    "colorcode is assigned according to grazing rate @xmath25 .",
    "overall the stability diagram exhibits similar pattern as in fig .",
    "specifically , the region of stable coexistence enlarges for higher immobilization . as it seems reasonable the number of stable solutions and the 3-species permanence zone in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] gradually broadens with the increase of predation pressure from predator @xmath6 .",
    "simultaneously fewer exclusion steady states for the predator @xmath6 are discovered .        in this section",
    "the equilibrium solutions and stability of the equilibria are discussed for the system ( [ eq.2 ] ) with the mechanism of species turnover . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the regions of stable ( unstable ) equilibria are plotted versus the enrichment and the transfer rate .",

    "we investigate how the dynamics in the extended igp system responded to variation of enrichment levels . for each case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] an increase of enrichment is accompanied with a series of bifurcations in the system manifested by an invasion of higher trophic levels similar to predictions from the linear food chain theory @xcite .",
    "for instance , at low enrichment both regimes @xmath63 and @xmath13 are stable .",
    "further increase of @xmath21 at fixed @xmath64 results in a chain of bifurcations from a stable regime @xmath63 to an unstable @xmath51 and subsequently to a stable coexistence regime @xmath13 .",
    "a further increase of carrying capacity favours an exclusion of @xmath6 and shifts the population densities towards the dominance of the ig predator .",
    "an interesting feature is that at low transfer rate only a coexistence of the ig predator and the resource is found .",
    "the second subpopulation @xmath55 is extinguished fast due to predation and low transfer rate .",
    "the steady states found for low enrichment are similar to the case of a single prey population without transfer mechanism at @xmath56 and @xmath65 .",
    "as typified on the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] d the ig prey levels remain positive . since the ig prey has an advantage as a competitor for the shared resource only the ig predator gets excluded from the system .",

    "changes of these parameters produce different emergent patterns as shown in fig .",
    "the location of states of stable ( unstable ) permanence and the exclusion zone of @xmath6 is still comparable to the patterns shown in fig .",

    "[ fig7 ] @xmath66 and @xmath67 . at higher transfer rates",
    "the coexistence of all 3-species is no longer observed and only the population of ig prey and resource persist .",
    "due to low productivity the densities of the basal resource @xmath7 are quickly depleted and the ig predator is driven to extinction . on the contrary ,",

    "there is growing evidence from theoretical and empirical studies that creating additional trophic links have a stabilizing effect on food webs @xcite .",
    "generalized models reveal that the stability of food webs can be enhanced when species at higher trophic levels graze upon multiple prey species  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for low dimensional food webs it is demonstrated that an addition of alternative food resources can stabilize the interactions @xcite and open up a possibility for feedbacks on population dynamics due to apparent competition .",
    "the predictions of our model confirm the main conclusions given in a theoretical study of an extended igp model @xcite . in the alternative formulations used here the ig prey",
    "has the access to an extra resource beyond the shared resource for which both predators compete .",
    "this extra resource is a more attractive resource item for the ig prey and is thus attacked at higher rates by the ig prey whereas the attack rate of the ig predator stays the same .",
    "moreover the ig predator indirectly stimulated the growth of the ig prey population by providing this extra resource .",
    "our predictions tested by the application of a stability analysis are robust in the sense that they are independent of the form of the interaction term that is responsible for the availability of an additional resource .",
    "we demonstrate that for different formulations of the basic igp model with the embedded interactions a stable 3-species coexistence is ultimately reached whenever a moderate strength of the omnivorous links is used .",
    "however , the problem to relate the experimental findings @xcite to the theoretical predictions of our model ( [ eq.2 ] ) still remains open .",
    "since the experiment is aimed to observe a short term populations development it is not easy to find a direct correspondence between empirical population dynamics and theoretically predicted behaviour . in the @xmath93 day batch culture experiment of lder",
    "et al . with all 3 species present both predators _ g. dominans _ and _ f. ehrenbergii _ displayed positive growth while the prey population _ s. trochoidea _ displayed simultaneously a sharp decline to almost zero .",
    "how can this behaviour be classified according to our theoretical model ? could it be a part of an oscillatory cycle or an unstable state ?",
    "it is not easy to answer these questions , however , we can make a guess that the short term evolution observed in the experiment recasts as a part of an oscillatory cycle for a periodic equilibrium state found at intermediate immobilization . a similar type of experiments performed for various initial species densities could furnish a justification of this hypothesis .",
    "the above results demonstrate that a persistence of ig predator , ig prey and resource is achieved even at a low value of immobilization rate .",
    "moreover , a significantly higher percentage of observed stable configurations is found when the immobilization and transfer links in ( [ eq.1 ] ) and ( [ eq.2 ] ) are strengthened . because our model is an oversimplification of the experimental behaviour the partitioning of the parameter space according to stable versus unstable coexistence could be used as an approximation of the population dynamics found in a real experimental situation .",
    "firstly , the conditions for long term stable coexistence found by numerical simulations are not so easy to examine experimentally because of technical and temporal restrictions .",
    "experimental samples in ref .",
    "@xcite are taken during @xmath93 days of incubation due to a decline of the prey population . secondly , due to the existence of stable limit cycles as predicted by our linear stability analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) the oscillatory solutions go through a period of very low densities and might be driven to extinction in the presence of random fluctuations of the environment .",
    "we point out that our numerical simulations of the extended 3-species igp module ( [ eq.1 ] ) do not explore the entire swath of parameters and configurations for the steady states .",
    "rather our analysis focuses on explaining conceptual features of the igp model with diverse prey populations .",
    "earlier studies focussing on dynamics of complex ecological communities @xcite demonstrated the importance of multiple prey traits in mitigating predator selection pressures and altering predator - induced behavioural shifts in natural environments @xcite .",
    "our model can also be adapted to food web communities in which differentiation among prey individuals , namely , variation in individual traits such as fitness and mobility , is a result of heterogeneities in their natural habitat and/or adaptation of the species to the local conditions of the habitat .",
    "we show that an existing diversity of resource items traits can significantly alter the emergent community patterns . adding new subpopulations of resources with distinct traits that are more vulnerable to an attack from the ig predator",
    "facilitates the coexistence of both igp - related predators which compete for the common food resource .",
    "thus , the presence of an alternative resource indirectly induces shifts in exploitative competition .",
    "it is important to note that a general mathematical model with density- dependent interactions and immobilization do not render a unique theoretical description for the results of the experiment @xcite .",
    "our model predictions can be tested against alternative formulations .",
    "indeed , the main features of the experimental system can be examined by the inclusion of predation rates that are dependent on the mobility of the resource species . since slow and immobile individuals",
    "can also be found among mobile species one can use an inhomogeneous distribution of velocities of the resource species in a theoretical model . to guarantee more benefit for an intermediate consumer in catching a certain type of individual distinct predation rates should be assigned according to different velocities of resource species .",
    "another question is if the growth rate of the ig predator will be affected by the inclusion of the time of resource capture . how will the inclusion of the time lag change the predictions of our immobilization model ?",
    "these extensions of a general igp model will be a topic for our future investigations .",
    "finally , we point out that it is of potential interest for biological control and conservation management to understand functioning of omnivory and igp systems in relation to global changes of the environment .",
    "since igp food webs are widespread in natural communities their adaptation and resilience behaviour is principal for understanding the restructuring of natural communities .",
    "we have used three formulations of a general igp model to explore the effects of increasing diversity in the prey population on higher trophic levels .",
    "the reformulated igp model alters the results from the basic igp theory @xcite .",
    "we show that an increase of a number of trophic interactions in the system via differentiation of resource can stabilize the population dynamics of the igp module .",
    "this conclusion holds for the densities of the ig prey that level up even when the ig predator is a superior competitor for the common basal resource .",
    "first , we show that for the system with the immobilization term up to three regions of stable trophic configurations are observed along the enrichment gradient .",
    "meanwhile at low enrichment both ig prey and ig predator are excluded , at high enrichment the presence of only small concentration of immobilized cells is sufficient to facilitate the coexistence of the competitors in the igp relationship .",
    "moreover the percentage of all admissible trophic configurations for the 3-species persistence inclines substantially for higher immobilization .",
    "second , given that immobilization is high enough it prompts the exchange between pools of mobile and immobilized resource and facilitates fast decline of the mobile population and a growth of immobilized subpopulation .",
    "meanwhile the exchange between the basal mobile resource and the predators gets weaker due to the low density of mobile species the immobilized individuals become a major food resource for the predators . because the ig prey is a superior competitor for immobilized resource",
    "a robust coexistence of both predators will be easily supported .",
    "in addition , along an increasing gradient of immobilization the relative abundance of ig prey becomes higher than the abundance of ig predator .",
    "restructuring of the basic igp module by adding individual - to - individual turnover facilitates the coexistence and stabilizes the otherwise unstable system .",
    "moreover a strengthening of the interaction link leads to a significantly broader range of enrichment values at which stable coexistence could be found . at low transfer rate",
    "two types of equilibria are observed : @xmath1 if the ig predator is a superior competitor for the resources than at low enrichment both predators are excluded and at high enrichment only the ig predator stays in the system ; @xmath2 an increase of the attack rates of the ig prey depresses the population of the ig predator until it is completely excluded .",
    "numerical simulations of food web ( [ eq.1 ] ) with @xmath75 and @xmath76 distinct pools demonstrate that the high dimensional food webs overall manifest far less stable behaviour than the food webs with only two distinct subpopulations .",
    "an interesting feature is that the percentage of stable states for @xmath79 substantially decreases from @xmath94 to @xmath87 with an apparent increase of the value of transfer rate .",
    "by contrast , for food webs with @xmath86 an increase in transfer rate leads to the growth of the percentage of stable coexistence solutions from about @xmath89 to @xmath81 .      in the appendix",
    "we review the steady state solutions for the lotka - volterra models ( [ eq.2 ] ) and ( [ eq.3 ] ) and provide jacobian matrices to examine their local stability for the coexistence of both predators and the resource .",
    "first , equilibrium solutions are derived for the 3-species model  ( [ eq.2 ] ) with zero immobilization ( @xmath95 ) and zero initial size of immobilized population ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "<S> we consider two models : an igp module with immobilization by the top predator and an igp module with species turnover . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the effect of increasing enrichment and varying immobilization ( resource transfer ) rate on a stable coexistence of predators and resources . </S>",
    "<S> we explore how the predictions from the basic 3-species model are altered when the igp module is extended to multiple resource subpopulations . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate which parameters support a robust coexistence in the igp system . for the case of multiple subpopulations of the resource we present a numerical comparison of the percentage of food webs with stable coexistence for different dimensionalities of the resource community . at low immobilization ( transfer ) </S>",
