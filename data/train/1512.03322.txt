    "polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have opened the door to the study of nonlinear phenomena in fluids of light  @xcite .",
    "one of their main properties is their ability to spontaneously accumulate in the same quantum state above a certain excitation density threshold , giving rise to the phenomenon of polariton lasing  @xcite .",
    "similar to standard photon lasers  @xcite , the onset of polariton lasing is accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry , resulting in emission with a high degree of temporal and spatial coherence  @xcite . additionally , polaritons are spinor quasiparticles with two possible projections of their internal spin along the growth axis of the microstructure , which map into right and left circularly polarized photons when leaking out of the cavity .",
    "thus , in the presence of in - plane cylindrical symmetry , the order parameter of the polariton laser is a vector , and the spontaneous symmetry breaking results in the set up of a global and an internal phase , the latter defining the polarization of the emission .",
    "this kind of spontaneous spin order emerges , for instance , in atomic bose - einstein condensates with several degenerate hyperfine levels and ferromagnetic - like interactions , resulting in the formation of spatially polarized domains  @xcite . in the case of polaritons , interactions are in most situations antiferromagnetic ( same spin interactions are repulsive and stronger than opposite spin ones )  @xcite , and it has been suggested that polariton lasing should then be linearly polarized , corresponding to the lowest energy ( interacting ) state  @xcite .",
    "this assumes the polariton laser being in thermodynamic equilibrium , which is not usually the case : the pump - dissipative dynamics might trigger lasing in excited states  @xcite .",
    "additionally , polariton - polariton interactions are rather weak at threshold ( the interaction energy is much smaller than the linewidth ) . in line with these two arguments , out - of - equilibrium and weak interactions , read and coworkers predicted that close to threshold , the initial polarization should be completely random , taking any possible value in the poincar sphere with equal probability , including circular and elliptical polarizations  @xcite .",
    "the same phenomena is expected in a photon laser in semiconductor vcsels .    despite the key role of the polarization initialization and subsequent evolution in the symmetry breaking physics in microcavities",
    ", experiments have not yet addressed the polarization dynamics in the onset of polariton lasing .",
    "the reason is the required high temporal resolution , on the order of the polariton coherence time being as low as a few picoseconds below threshold , in combination with single shot experiments capable of resolving the initial polarization on each experimental realization .",
    "experiments under continuous wave excitation have shown polariton lasing whose polarization was pinned to the crystallographic axis or to local spatial inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "this situation results in a classical bifurcation to circularly polarized states under strong pumping , when polariton - polariton interactions are relevant  @xcite . in the pulsed regime , experiments have been analyzed by integrating the emission over its whole duration in refs .  .",
    "those works showed evidence of the stochastic initial polarization direction in a polariton laser , but the temporal dynamics was not accessed .",
    "the vector symmetry breaking physics of a polariton laser still lacks ultrafast experimental reports .    in this article",
    "we use a single - shot ultrafast detection technique based on a streak camera with a time resolution of @xmath1 to measure the polarization dynamics of a gaas / algaas polariton laser via the statistics of the emitted intensity  @xcite .",
    "the second order coherence function of the total emitted photons at zero delay ( @xmath2 ) rapidly decreases to 1 above the condensation threshold , showing that the statistics of the polariton laser emission is poissonian . when the emission is selected in polarization , we observe that the initial polarization is stochastic , taking any possible direction in the poincar sphere ( linear , elliptical or circular polarization ) .",
    "subsequent oscillations of the second order correlation witness the rotation of the polarization around the direction of an intrinsic linear polarization splitting present in our samples . when the initial polarization is circular , polariton interactions counteract the polarization splitting and preserve the initial polarization .",
    "thus , contrary to the extended idea that the initial polarization of the polariton laser should be linear  @xcite , we show that it can take any value , in agreement with the prediction of read et al .",
    "@xcite in the weakly interacting regime .",

    "we can evaluate the magnitude of the polariton interactions both in the planar cavity and the micropillar by estimating the number of polaritons in the lasing mode . to do so",
    ", we assume that exactly at threshold , each spatial mode is populated by one polariton . in the case of the planar cavity , at @xmath118",
    "the measured intensity shows that we have 7 polaritons per mode ( the emitted intensity is 7 times stronger than at threshold ) . we can estimate the size of each spatial modes from the measured polariton lifetime , given by the measured q factor , and the polariton mass . in our case ,",
    "the polariton lifetime is @xmath119 , while its mass is @xmath120 , giving an estimated spatial diameter of 5.8  @xmath121 for the @xmath122 modes .",
    "thus we find that the number of modes within the lasing region , with a diameter of @xmath123 ( determined by the excitation spot ) , is about 7 .    assuming a polariton - polariton interaction constant of @xmath124   @xcite and accounting for a mode diameter of 5.8 @xmath121",
    ", we estimate the total interaction energy at @xmath118 to be @xmath125 ( where we have neglected interaction between polaritons with opposite circular polarization  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar estimation of the interaction energy can be done for the pillar cavity . in this case",
    "the mode size is determined by the pillar size , and amounts to @xmath126 . by comparing the emitted intensity at @xmath28 and @xmath39",
    ", we find 305 polaritons per mode at the latter power , resulting in an estimated interaction energy of @xmath127 .",
