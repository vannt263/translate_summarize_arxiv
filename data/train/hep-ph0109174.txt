    "recently there has been considerable interest in the connection between hard inclusive and exclusive reactions , which has been , in part , due to the unifying rle of skewed parton distributions ( spd s ) @xcite . aside from being the natural marriage of form factors and parton distributions , spd s appear when one tries to calculate scattering amplitudes such as those for compton scattering @xcite , the electroproduction of mesons @xcite , and di - jet production by pions on nuclei @xcite .",
    "there is much effort underway related to the measurement of these functions @xcite .",
    "intuitively clear , but simple models @xcite have been used to provide first calculations ( more sophisticated approaches have been pursued @xcite ) and physical interpretations have been elucidated in the forward limit @xcite . in this paper , we attempt to gain intuition about the structure of these distributions by considering two - body , light - front models as an explicitly worked example . continuing with our previous work @xcite",
    ", we consider the spd for a toy scalar _ meson _ consisting of two , equally massive scalar _",
    "quarks_. the features which are general in our approach are the energy denominators , which will be encountered in any calculation of spd s ( e.g. for a hadron of spin-@xmath1 consisting of spin-@xmath1 quarks ) .",
    "simple two - body , wave function models of spd s suffer from an inability to describe all kinematical rgimes physically accessible . on the other hand ,",
    "using a light - front fock - space decomposition of the initial and final hadron states gives one a powerful general expression for the spd s as sums of diagonal and non - diagonal overlaps @xcite encompassing all kinematical rgimes . in practice , however , this approach is limited by our current knowledge of the higher fock - space components of hadrons and one seems constrained to use gaussian _ anstze _ for these components @xcite for which essential physics may be absent .",
    "generalizing a rather prescient method due to einhorn @xcite , we avoid the need to obtain higher fock - space components explicitly by using the bethe - salpeter equation , and crossing symmetry . at this stage , we sacrifice exactness ( by neglecting the mass squared dependence of the interaction throughout ) in order to build intuition about these distributions in this approach .",
    "we find that one need only use the lowest fock - space components ( here the @xmath2 pair ) and the equation of motion to access all kinematical rgimes of the spd with model wave functions .",
    "we note that recently a similar analysis , although tentative , appeared for spin-@xmath1 quarks in the context of spd s in @xcite .",
    "we begin in section [ cbs ] by writing the covariant bethe - salpeter equation for our meson and extract from this equation the light front wave function and its equation of motion ( the weinberg equation ) . by way of orthogonality and completeness",
    ", the green s function for the weinberg equation is then defined . in section [ dvcs ]",
    "we apply this analysis to the covariant , leading - twist diagram for deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "we carefully demonstrate that in the deeply virtual limit , spd s can be calculated from the light - front time - ordered triangle diagrams for the form factor , making clear the close connection between the sum rule and light - front time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "these diagrams are evaluated in section [ td ] in terms of @xmath0 light front wave functions where the z - graph is dealt with by crossing the interaction .",
    "the resulting bare - coupling spd s are derived and their simplicity is used to discuss continuity , @xmath3-symmetry and time reversal invariance properties .",
    "the demonstration of time reversal invariance for the bare - coupling spd s is started in section [ td ] and completed in appendix a.    the bare - coupling spd s are only ( partially ) valid at high @xmath4 , which is unfortunately not likely accessible in experiments . moreover",
    ", the effects of higher fock components in this approach are contained in the photon vertex function .",
    "thus inclusion of interactions at the photon vertex is required and carried out in section [ t ] , where we derive the photon vertex function in terms of the interacting theory green s function .",
    "finally the general form of the spd s is deduced in section [ again ] .",
    "these distributions satisfy the necessary symmetry properties and are continuous due to the behavior of the green s function near the end points . as",
    "calculation of the green s function is likely burdensome , we discuss in section [ approx ] possible approximations to the green s function which maintain the symmetry and continuity of the distributions .",
    "we explore first the born approximation valid at high @xmath4 ( which does not result in the bare - coupling spd s ) .",
    "next we examine the non - relativistic scheme and finally the closure approximation .",
    "the stage is set to apply the non - relativistic approximation scheme to the wick - cutkosky model in the weak - binding limit ( section [ wfns ] ) .",
    "we use this example to illustrate how to cross the interaction for partons moving backwards through time and thereby explicate that in general an _ ad hoc _ potential ( which might generate some phenomenological hadronic wave function ) lacks the field theoretic nature to accommodate such crossing .",
    "we then verify the sum rule for the form factor in the non - relativistic scheme , which is accomplished by using only the valence contribution to the spd .",
    "appendix b makes explicit the recovery of the drell - yan - west formula for the form factor in the limit of zero skewness .",
    "furthermore , we comment there on the general consequences and limitations of approximating the interaction to be independent of the mass squared .",
    "the extension to time - like form factors is carried out in appendix c. we proceed analogously with our consideration of spd s by deriving the sum rule for time like form factors in terms of generalized distribution amplitudes .",
    "then we calculate the generalized distribution amplitudes in terms of the relevant light - front time - ordered graphs .",
    "lastly we conclude briefly in section [ conc ] .",
    "fmfbs =    we start by writing down the equation for the meson vertex function @xmath5 .",
    "it satisfies a simple bethe - salpeter equation , first schematically as operators ( see figure [ fbs ] ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the full , renormalized , two - particle green s function ( which can be expressed as a product of two , renormalized , single - particle propagators ) . here",
    "@xmath8 is the interaction potential , which is the negative of the irreducible two - to - two scattering kernel .",
    "let us denote the meson four - momentum by @xmath9 , the quark s by @xmath10 , and the physical masses by @xmath11 .",
    "since our quarks are scalar particles , the renormalized , single particle propagator has a klein - gordon form : @xmath12 + i \\epsilon},\\ ] ] where the residue is one near the physical mass pole and the function @xmath13 characterizes the renormalized , one - particle irreducible self interactions .",
    "it is a matter of later notational convenience that we write @xmath14 .",
    "we shall assume there are no poles ( besides at the physical mass ) in the propagator .",
    "this is consistent with model studies @xcite . in the momentum representation",
    ", the bethe - salpeter equation then appears as @xmath15 in which we have defined the bethe - salpeter wave function @xmath16 as @xmath17    the bethe - salpeter wave function is covariant , thus in order to perform the light front reduction we must project out the @xmath18 hypersurface where the initial conditions , wave functions , _ etc .",
    "_ of our system are defined @xcite .",
    "( we define the plus and minus components of any vector by @xmath19 . )",
    "this projection onto the initial surface gives us the light front wave function , _ vis _ @xmath20 .",
    "the remarkable property of light front wave functions is that they depend not on the total momentum of the system but on the relative momenta of the constituents @xcite . since the constituents of our meson are two equally massive quarks , the relative momenta take a simple form . writing this dependence out explicitly , we see @xmath21 with @xmath22 and the pre - factors chosen with malice aforethought .",
    "in order to perform the @xmath18 projection on the bethe - salpeter wave function , we must know something about the analytic structure of the vertex function .",
    "we would like to perform the @xmath23 integration simply by assuming there are neither @xmath23 poles , nor branch cuts in the vertex function .",
    "looking at the effective @xmath0 potential in eq .",
    ", shows that the @xmath24 dependence of the interaction @xmath25 gives rise to the @xmath26 poles of the vertex function @xmath27 . thus taking the effective @xmath0 potential @xmath25 to be independent of the minus momenta eliminates the vertex function s dependence on the light - front energy and allows us to easily perform the light - front projection .",
    "the effective two - body interaction in @xmath28 qcd , for example , is independent of the minus momentum . though certainly this independence is far from general",
    ". calculating @xmath25 from light - front , time - ordered graphs , however , requires the _ on shell _ condition which removes any functional dependence on the minus momenta from @xmath8 and hence @xmath5 . now carrying out the @xmath23 integration on the bethe - salpeter wave function",
    ", we find @xmath29 where we have defined @xmath30 with the help of the abbreviation @xmath31 for the weinberg propagator @xmath32 the projection carried out in equation [ wf ] can also be utilized to establish the symmetry relation @xmath33 required for a system with equally massive quarks .",
    "notice we have implicitly altered the functional dependence from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . as a result of the integration in eq .",
    ", @xmath3 is restricted : @xmath36 . thus the light - front wave function vanishes for @xmath3 outside this range .",
    "( [ wf ] ) gives the relation between the vertex function and the light front wave function .",
    "this relation will be exploited to evaluate feynman graphs in terms of wave functions below  provided , of course , @xmath36 .",
    "it remains to find the equation of motion satisfied by the wave function @xmath37 .",
    "we accomplish this by performing the @xmath38 integration in the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "@xmath39 with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the above equation can be written as the weinberg equation @xcite by relocating the renormalized self interactions into the definition of the potential .",
    "to do so , we write the above equation more suggestively as an eigenvalue equation : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 with @xmath44 as the kinetic term @xmath45 and @xmath46 as the potential , whose action on @xmath47 is spelled out by @xmath48 \\psi(y,\\operatorname{\\mathbf{p}^{\\perp}}),\\ ] ] with @xmath49 at this level , the action of the potential is still exact , however , the self interactions as well as the potential function depend on @xmath50 .",
    "if we neglect this dependence ( as is possible in @xmath28 qcd , or to leading order in a weakly bound system where @xmath51 ) then the weinberg equation becomes a standard eigenvalue equation . under this assumption , the eigenfunctions @xmath52 satisfy orthonormality and completeness , which appear in our normalization convention as @xmath53 @xmath54    the green s function for the weinberg equation @xmath55 thus satisfies the equation @xmath56 clearly approximating away the @xmath57 dependence of the interaction has limitations .",
    "we spell out some of the relevant consequences in appendix b.",
    "fmfdvcs    ( 40,40 )    skewed parton distributions show up , for example , as generalized form factors in deeply virtual compton scattering",
    ". we will introduce the spd s in this way . in our toy model",
    ", we imagine a virtual photon interacting with our meson ( labeled as @xmath58 ) but leaving it intact @xmath59 : @xmath60 this process is certainly not imaginable in any realistic experimental setup , however , it is related by crossing symmetry to the physical reaction @xmath61 which was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the relation between spd s and the generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas)which characterize two pion production  was pursued in @xcite . in appendix c , we illustrate this connection in our light - front approach by calculating our model s gda via the time - like form factor .    returning to compton scattering , the momentum transfer suffered by the meson we denote by @xmath62 ( and its invariant @xmath63 ) , where the @xmath64 labels @xmath65 .",
    "the leading - twist ( _ handbag _ ) diagram for this process is depicted in figure [ dvcs ] where we give the parameterization of the intermediate momenta .",
    "we follow the standard simplification @xcite and choose a frame where @xmath66 @xcite , so that @xmath67 . in the deeply virtual limit , @xmath68 is taken to be large while the ratio @xmath69 is finite .",
    "this defines @xmath70 as the bjorken variable for deeply virtual compton scattering . in this section",
    ", we work in the asymmetrical frame where the initial meson s transverse momentum vanishes and consequently @xmath71 .",
    "lastly , we define @xmath72 as the ratio of the active quark s plus - momentum to that of the initial meson : @xmath73 .    at leading twist",
    ", we can ignore interactions at the quark - photon vertex as well as quark self - interactions between photon absorbtion and emission .",
    "evaluating the diagram shown in the figure thus yields @xmath74 where @xmath75 signifies that this contribution is that of figure [ dvcs ] .",
    "we also need to calculate the crossed diagram @xmath76 to get the covariant amplitude @xmath77 .",
    "the denominator in ( [ diag ] ) which depends on the momentum @xmath78 can be dramatically simplified in the deeply virtual limit .",
    "furthermore there is a cancellation in this limit from the numerator of @xmath79 : @xmath80 there is an analogous cancellation in the deeply virtual limit when we evaluate the crossed diagram @xmath81 . @xmath82",
    "the remaining terms in the integral are the same for each diagram .",
    "thus in the deeply virtual limit , we can decompose the compton amplitude as @xmath83    removing the @xmath84 integral from the expressions for @xmath85 and @xmath86 reveals @xmath87 this is just the integrand of the covariant triangle diagram which gives the electromagnetic form factor . in this way we rediscover the sum rule of ji @xcite : @xmath88 where the factor @xmath89 appears because we normalize to the average meson momentum @xmath90 .",
    "the kinematics gives the relation @xmath91 .",
    "the other factor , @xmath92 , removes the derivative coupling at the photon vertex from the spd .",
    "the @xmath70-independence of the form factor is due to lorentz covariance .",

    "thus in calculating the triangle graph from eq .",
    "( [ covartri ] ) , we no longer have the freedom remaining to choose @xmath94 which is often done in calculating form factors",

    "all poles lie in the lower - half plane .",
    "then for both of these cases , we merely choose the contour which avoids enclosing any poles and , by cauchy , the integral vanishes .",
    "to evaluate the @xmath38 integral for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we must enclose at least one pole when closing the contour .",
    "first let us look at the case @xmath101 .",

    "precisely the same reasons above , both schemes preserve the drell - yan - west formula in the forward limit .    having demonstrated",
    "there are no singularities associated with the limit @xmath128 , we can also extract our model s quark distribution function @xmath333 .",
    "this is then simply the forward limit of eq .",
    "[ ndpd1 ] , namely @xmath334 the square of the meson s wave function . in light of our above analysis",
    ", we know that the wave function vanishes quadratically at the end points and thus @xmath335 vanishes there as well .",
    "this is physical at @xmath336 since one parton can not posses all of the meson s plus momentum . at @xmath337 , however , the non - valence partons can rescue one parton from carrying all the plus momentum and so such configurations have non - zero probability , i.e. @xmath338 .",
    "indeed the fact that our model distributions vanish at @xmath339 is tied directly to neglecting the mass squared dependence of the effective interaction in the two - body subspace .",
    "the non - valence probability amplitude @xmath340 is simply @xmath341 where @xmath342 is the projection of the interaction on the two - body subspace ( simply denoted as @xmath8 above ) .",
    "accounting for the mass squared dependence of the effective interaction allows for non - valence contributions to the quark distribution functions .",
    "there are further consequences , however , given the unifying role of spd s .",
    "the drell - yan - west formula , for example , will have corrections ( of particular importance to the form factor s @xmath3-integrand at small @xmath3 ) , and adding interactions at the photon vertex will then change the form factor .",
    "it has already been noticed @xcite that model deuteron wave functions have better covariance properties than their form factors calculated from drell - yan - west expressions .",
    "lastly the most general consequence is to affect the spd s , particularly at the crossover , e.g. @xmath343 seen here ( as well as in @xcite ) stems directly from neglecting the mass squared dependence .",
    "the crossover point thus probes a convolution of non - valence states for which this approach may possibly be apt in describing , however , it would require a reworking of the photon vertex that does not make use of the potential model s green s function .",
    "( as for the light - cone fock space expansion , calculation of wave functions at small @xmath3 is rather complicated but contains rich information about the relation between different fock components @xcite . )",
    "time - like form factors have been often avoided in the light - front approach due to the unavoidable presence of non - wave function vertices .",
    "this complication is mirrored in the scheme of @xcite : the time - like pion form factor does not have a direct decomposition in terms of pion fock component overlaps alone . here",
    "we show how the above analysis can be applied to time - like form factors ; that is , we obtain expressions in terms of two - body bethe - salpeter wave functions and the four - point green s functions .",
    "furthermore , we make the connection with the generalized distribution amplitude for our model which encodes the non - perturbative physics of two pion production @xcite .",
    "we attempt below to preserve the notation set up in these references .",
    "the time - like pion form factor @xmath344 is defined by ( see figure [ timetri ] ) @xmath345 where @xmath346 is the center of mass energy squared . here",
    "the pion is merely our @xmath0 pair .",
    "now define @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "we can work out the kinematics of this reaction to find @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the pion mass and we work in the frame in which @xmath351 . .",
    "the gda for our model has a definition in terms of a non - diagonal matrix element of bi - local field operators @xmath352 such a definition of the gda leads us immediately to the sum rule @xmath353 and hence a means to calculate @xmath354 from the integrand of the time - like form factor .",
    "returning to figure [ timetri ] , we can write down the expression for the time - like form factor @xmath355 and perform the light - front reduction by integrating out the minus dependence",
    ". whenever troublesome momentum fractions appear , we use the equation of motion to insert the crossed interaction .",
    "lastly we merely extract the derivative coupling and @xmath356-integral from the photon vertex function to uncover the gda . using @xmath357",
    ", the relevant contribution from the photon vertex appears as @xmath358 with @xmath359 .    carrying out this evaluation yields @xmath360 ^ 3 w ( w-\\zeta ) ( 1-w ) x ( 1-x ) z ( 1-z ) } \\psi(x,\\operatorname{\\mathbf{\\kappa}^{\\perp } } )   g(z,\\operatorname{\\mathbf{q}^{\\perp } } ; w , \\operatorname{\\mathbf{k}^{\\perp}}| s ) \\\\   \\times \\bigg ( \\phi_{a}(w , \\operatorname{\\mathbf{k}^{\\perp } } ; x , \\operatorname{\\mathbf{\\kappa}^{\\perp } } ) \\ ; \\theta [ w ( \\zeta - w ) ] + \\phi_{b}(w,\\operatorname{\\mathbf{k}^{\\perp}};x,\\operatorname{\\mathbf{\\kappa}^{\\perp } } ) \\ ; \\theta[(1-w)(w - \\zeta ) ] \\bigg ) \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have abbreviated @xmath361 with @xmath362 .",
    "the two contributions ( @xmath363 and @xmath331 ) to the gda can be interpreted graphically , see figure [ gdafig ] .",
