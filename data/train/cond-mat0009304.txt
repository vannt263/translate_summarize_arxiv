    "the hard - sphere model has been a very useful reference system for our understanding of classical liquids @xcite . as far as static correlations are concerned , an analytical expression for the pair correlation is available @xcite and provides a good first approximation for particles interacting via smooth - potential functions .",
    "the hard - sphere model is even more important for the dynamics , because it allows for approximate analytical solutions , based on the boltzmann equation and its generalization by enskog to account for a finite particle diameter and pair correlations at contact @xcite .",
    "the model has the additional advantage that it is particularly well suited for numerical simulations @xcite and in fact many of the important phenomena of dense liquids have been observed first in simulations of hard spheres .",
    "examples are the discovery of long - time tails @xcite and two - dimensional solids @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly the model has become very popular also in the context of granular media , which are characterized by inelastic collisions of their constituents .",
    "focusing on the rapid - flow regime , where kinetic theory should apply , generalized boltzmann- and enskog equations have been formulated and solved approximately @xcite .",
    "the success of the boltzmann - enskog equation in classical fluids is based on the linearisation of the collision operator around local equilibrium .",
    "the resulting linear hermitean operator can then be treated by standard methods of functional analysis @xcite .",
    "for inelastic systems no analog of the local equilibrium distribution is known . in many studies , including the present one , a homogeneity assumption is made , which is known to be unstable for dense and large enough system and long times @xcite . hence the analysis is restricted to small and intermediate densities .",
    "alternatively , one may restrict oneself to almost elastic collisions and expand around the elastic case .",
    "kinetic theory of rough , inelastic , circular disks was first discussed by jenkins and richman @xcite .",
    "these authors introduced two temperatures , one for the translational and one for the rotational degrees of freedom , and studied deviations from a two - temperature maxwellian distribution , using grad s moment expansion .",
    "subsequently lun and savage @xcite extended the approach to rough , inelastic spheres .",
    "a set of conservation equations and constitutive relations was derived from the boltzmann equation , assuming small inelasticity and surface roughness .",
    "goldshtein and shapiro @xcite discuss in detail the homogeneous cooling state of rough spheres .",
    "they determine the asymptotic ratio of rotational to translational energy as a function of surface roughness and coefficient of normal restitution .",
    "hydrodynamic equations and constitutive relations are derived with help of the enskog expansion .",
    "more recently , event - driven simulations of rough spheres have been performed by mcnamara and luding @xcite .",
    "they investigate free cooling as a function of arbitrary surface roughness and normal restitution and compare their results to an approximate kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "most analytical and numerical studies of kinetic phenomena have concentrated on spherical objects so far .",
    "the question then arises , which of the results are specific to spherical objects and which are generic for inelastically colliding particles .",
    "a single collision of two arbitrarily shaped , but convex objects is quite difficult to describe analytically @xcite , set aside the problem of an ensemble of colliding grains . in this paper",
    "we have chosen the simplest non spherical objects , needles , which allow for an analytical , albeit approximate solution and large scale simulations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[section2 ] we introduce the time evolution operator . for pedagogical reasons",
    "we first discuss smooth potentials and recall the formalism of a pseudo - liouville operator for elastic , hard - core collisions .",
    "subsequently the formalism is extended to inelastic , rough spheres and needles .",
    "the homogeneous cooling state is introduced in sec .",
    "we present results for both spheres and needles , assuming a maxwellian distribution for linear and angular momenta .",
    "we show with simulations that for dense systems of needles the assumption of homogeneity breaks down .",
    "corrections to a gaussian approximation are discussed in sec .",
    "[ expansion ] . finally in sec . [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize results and present conclusions .",
    "some details of the calculation are delegated to appendices .",
    "we are interested in macroscopic properties of systems of many particles which are themselves meso- or macroscopic , i.e. behave according to the laws of classical mechanics as opposed to quantum mechanics .",
    "in addition , our systems are _ granular _ so energy is not conserved .",
    "this means that they can not be treated with hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "we will present here a formalism based on the liouville operator that enables us nevertheless to derive properties of the system under consideration .",
    "we consider two different models : the first is a system of spheres of diameter @xmath0 and the second is one of ( infinitely ) thin rods or needles of length @xmath1 . in order to keep the discussion as transparent as possible",
    ", the formalism of the ( pseudo ) liouville operator will be demonstrated for hamiltonian systems with smooth potentials first , for hard core potentials next , and finally for granular spheres and needles .",
    "it is interesting to note that both cases , spheres and needles , are analytically tractable so that comparisons between different geometrical particle shapes are possible .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath2 classical particles of mass @xmath3 in a volume @xmath4 , interacting through pairwise potentials .",
    "the system is characterized by its total energy @xmath5 in terms of particle momenta @xmath6 and coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "the time evolution of an observable @xmath8 , which is a function of phase space variables @xmath9 , but does not depend on time explicitly , is given in terms of the poisson bracket by @xmath10 this defines the liouville operator @xmath11 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath12 can then formally be written in terms of @xmath11 : @xmath13 .",
    "we decompose the liouville operator @xmath14 into a free - streaming part @xmath15 and an operator @xmath16 , which accounts for interactions .",
    "the definition of the poisson bracket , @xmath17 thus yields @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "a pseudo - liouville operator for hard - core collisions has been formulated by ernst et al .",
    "@xcite and has been applied by many groups @xcite to study the dynamic evolution of a gas of hard spheres .",
    "collisions are instantaneous and characterized by collision rules . in a collision of two particles ,",
    "numbered @xmath20 and @xmath21 , their pre - collisional velocities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are changed instantaneously to their post - collisional values @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 according to @xmath26 we have denoted the relative velocity by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the free - streaming part of the liouville operator remains unchanged , whereas the part which accounts for interactions has to be modified because the potential is no longer differentiable in the limit of hard - core interactions . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath11 is no longer self adjoint as it is for systems with smooth potentials .",
    "this is why it is called a pseudo - liouville operator for hard - core systems .",
    "for the same reason we will need _ two _ liouville operators below , one for forward and one for backward time evolution .    in order to construct the pseudo liouville operator , we consider the change of a dynamical variable due to a collision of just two particles .",
    "what we need is an operator @xmath29 that    * gives the change of an observable through a collision when integrated over a short time interval containing the collision time ( since the hard core interaction is non - differentiable , we have to resort to integrating over the collision instead of looking at the derivatives directly ) , * only acts at the time of contact , * only acts when the particles are approaching but not when they are receding .    the second requirement can be satisfied by @xmath30 , the third one demands @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the usual heaviside step function . in order to satisfy the first point",
    ", we use an operator @xmath33 which is defined by its action on an observable @xmath12 according to @xmath34 i.e. it simply replaces all velocities according to eqs . .",
    "the operator @xmath29 should give the _ change _ induced by a collision , so that @xmath35 .",
    "we collect the three terms and make sure to include a prefactor which is chosen such that the integration of an observable over a short time interval around the collision time yields the change of the observable , as induced by the collision rules .",
    "the complete expression for @xmath29 is thus @xmath36 since the probability that three or more particles touch at precisely the same instant is zero , we only need to consider two - particle collisions and find for the time - evolution operator for the system of elastically colliding hard spheres : @xmath37 the negative time evolution is given by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the operator that replaces post - collisional velocities by pre - collisional ones .",
    "hard - core models of elastically colliding spheres have been extended to include _ rotational _ degrees of freedom and _ surface roughness _ @xcite .",
    "rotational degrees of freedom offer the possibility to describe molecules with internal degrees of freedom and surface roughness is needed to transfer energy from the translational degrees of freedom to the rotational ones .",
    "we only discuss the simplest case of identical spheres of mass @xmath3 , moment of inertia @xmath40 and diameter @xmath0 .",
    "translational motion is characterized by the center - of - mass velocities @xmath41 and rotational motion by the angular velocities @xmath42 .",
    "let the surface normal @xmath43 at the point of contact point from sphere 2 to sphere 1 .",
    "the important quantity to model the collision is the relative velocity of the point of contact : @xmath44 there are two contributions , firstly the center of mass velocity of each sphere , and secondly the contributions from the rotations of each sphere .",
    "the minus sign in the first parenthesis stems from the fact that the surface normal , as it was defined , points outwards for sphere 2 and inwards for sphere 1 .",
    "now we can specify the collision rules .",
    "primed variables always denote quantities immediately after the collision ; unprimed variables denote pre - collisional quantities : @xmath45    as we are still dealing with elastic spheres , energy conservation requires @xmath46 , corresponding to perfectly rough spheres , where the tangential velocity component is completely reversed .",
    "perfectly smooth spheres @xmath47 are also compatible with energy conservation , but reduce to the above simple case of spheres without rotational degrees of freedom , because during collision the angular velocities remain unchanged .",
    "later , we will also admit other values for @xmath48 .",
    "form three linearly independent equations .",
    "in addition , total momentum is conserved , @xmath49 and forces during a collision can only act at the point of contact .",
    "therefore there is no torque with respect to this point and consequently we have conserved angular momentum ( also with respect to the point of contact ) for _ both _ particles involved : @xmath50 altogether we have 12 independent equations for 12 unknowns , namely the four vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 with three components each . solving for these ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath53 the dimensionless constant @xmath54 abbreviates a frequently appearing combination of factors .",
    "we have also introduced two parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 , because we anticipate the more general collision rules for the inelastic case . for",
    "elastically colliding spheres , we simply have @xmath57 and @xmath58 for perfectly rough and @xmath59 for perfectly smooth spheres .    the pseudo - liouville operator for elastically colliding rough spheres is still given by eq .",
    "but the operator @xmath60 now replaces linear _ and _ angular velocities according to eqs . .",
    "elastic collisions of hard needles have been discussed by frenkel et al .",
    "it is straightforward to rephrase their results in terms of a pseudo - liouville operator @xcite .",
    "the free streaming part of the liouville operator is derived from the kinetic energy of the hamiltonian according to the general rules of classical dynamics .",
    "note however , that for needles , one of the moments of inertia is zero ; this implies that the angular - momentum component along the corresponding axis , which points along the orientation of the needle , is also always zero .",
    "therefore , rotations about this axis can be ignored , and @xmath61 has only two components , both perpendicular to the orientation of the needle .",
    "the center of mass coordinate of needle @xmath62 will be denoted by @xmath7 and its orientation by the unit vector @xmath63 .",
    "the moments of inertia perpendicular to @xmath63 are equal due to symmetry and will be denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "the formulation of the collision rules proceeds in close analogy to rough spheres .",
    "first we determine the conditions of contact .",

    "the only changes are in the condition for a collision to take place , @xmath91 and in the condition that the two particles are approaching , @xmath92 collecting terms and choosing the correct prefactor gives the result @xmath93 the operator @xmath33 replaces all velocities according to eqs . and .",
    "the collision rules for rough spheres and needles are easily generalized to inelastic collisions .",
