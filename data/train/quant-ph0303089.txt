    "since the very beginning of model theory ( mt ) , it was realized what is the position of formal language in the correct description of any mathematical structure .",
    "there is a big difference when we talk about same things using different formal languages .",
    "many `` paradoxical '' situations emerged in the development of the so called first order logic ( let me mention only l \" owenheim - skolem theorem or gdel theorems ) , which nonetheless serves as the logic depending on very minimal theoretical support from set theory and the like .",
    "it has resulted in emergence of various spectra of non isomorphic models , which first order theories must have ( ) .",
    "one can say , that these are merely formal peculiarities , which are not acting upon our every day practice ( espacially as a physicists ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , the theories such as : peano arithmetic ( pa ) , or axiomatized theory of natural numbers and zermello - fraenkel set theory ( with the axiom of choice [ ac ] ) zf(c ) , or axiomatized theory of sets  both are first order theories .",
    "this means that all paradoxical situations concern also them .",
    "because of the fact that very effective formalism of quantum mechanics ( qm ) was developed very early , people were not considering tools of mt in the context of qm ( also , they simply were not able to do so , because mt was being developed in the time quantum theory was as a young branch of mathematics ) . in the paradigm of",
    "qm people found it possible to talk about many worlds ( as in the everett interpretation of qm ) , but no one has tried to incorporate model theoretical tools in the shape of pluralities of models of basic enough theory as zfc is . in what follows we are giving some insights coming from mt , which might be helpful in analysing certain interpretational and formal aspects of quantum theory .",
    "firstly , in the face of the lwenheim - skolem theorem ( ) it follows that zfc ( if it is consistent , ) has a countable model .",
    "in particular , the set of real numbers in this model is countable from the `` outside '' ( ) .",
    "might it be , that discreteness of spectra of some physical quantum mechanical observables is connected to the discreteness of real numbers in some models of zfc ?    secondly , might it be that pluralities and non isomorphism of models of zf(c ) ( or some other formal theories ) can be connected to pluralities of quantum mechanical worlds in everettian style ?",
    "thirdly , as follows from kochen - specker theorem ( ) and epr kind of experiments , some physical observables can not have definite values before measurements .",
    "might this phenomenon be connected to nonexistence of some real numbers in some models of zf(c ) ?",
    "might it be that the real numbers in question , which are not present in one model , will appear in the other as a result of set theoretical forcing ?",
    "that would mean that the reals obtained as a result of measuring of some observables would emerge as a result of being forced to belong to some enlarged universum of sets .",
    "in this situation it would mean that there are inherent reasons for considering a non- constant universum of sets in the context of qm .",
    "whereas we avoid deciding about the import of the first two situations , we are to explore the third one . in general , detailed proofs are not included here .",
    "informal , intuitive explanations are often used in place of them .",
    "the proofs will be given elsewhere ( ) .",
    "we assume some elementary knowledge of set theoretical forcing ; the general reference is which also serves as a source for all set theoretical questions considered here .",
    "some knowledge of boolean valued models of zfc is also desirable ; the general reference is . in the context of qm , boolean",
    "valued models are discussed in takeuti .",
    "general references concerning topos theory are and .    there were some attempts recently , to interpret qm in terms of topos theory : , ( by the use of so called smooth toposes from synthetic differential geometry ( sdg ) ( ) ) or in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "also , there are some attempts to approach qm through model theoretic tools ( , , takeuti ) .",
    "much effort has been spent on working out connections of qm ( and other branches of physics ) with nonstandard analysis ( ) invented by as a purely model theoretical task ( robinson himself was one of the creators and main contributors to model theory ) .",
    "close connections of qm and formal logic were noticed from the very beginning of the subject ( ) .",
    "the so called quantum logic ( ql ) emerged as a special one and different from classical logic and intuitionistic logic ( ) .    synthetic differential geometry ( sdg )",
    "was worked out by and then developed by .",
    "the aim of this approach was to build common framework for toposes and nonstandard analysis in the robinsonnian style , as well as for differential geometry , which deals with infinitesimals called noninvertible or indempotent .",
    "needless to say , such unification is of great interest to physicists , too .",
    "because of that , there were some trials to use these techniques in the context of quantum and classical gravity ( ) or in qm ( ) . very nice features of toposes , which are inducing intuitionistic logic , and are natural models for arbitrarily high order logic , cause people naturally start to think about using the strangeness of the world generated by toposes ( the midle third law can be violated in toposes , standard natural numbers may be not a decidable object , there may not exist an object of naturals at all , set theory is generated in the inside of the topos ; toposes might serve as universes of discourse for mathematics , and so on ( ) ) to the strangeness ( at the interpretational level ) of the quantum world .",
    "however , one should be aware that :    * warning : * _ no topos is able to interprete qm in the sense that the logic generated by the topos is the one generated by quantum mechanical phenomena .",
    "_    proof : logical structure of any topos is based on heyting algebras ( ha ) . any ha is distributive one .",
    "quantum logic is based on the lattice of projections ( ) in some separable hilbert space .",
    "such a lattice is in general non distributive ( , ) ( the lattice of projections is distributive only in the case of one dimensional hilbert space ) . @xmath3",
    "forcing was discovered originally as a tool for proving some independence results in set theory from the axioms of zf(c ) ( ) and then , developed as very basic phenomenon in many different mathematical situations .",
    "solovay and and , independently , have given formulation of forcing in the language of so called boolean valued universes of zf(c ) . forcing as it stands has been shown to have specific significance in very general situations in the model theory ( ) .",
    "semantics connected to toposes ( at least to grothendieck toposes ) in a natural way is also modeled on forcing semantics ( sheaf semantics ) ( ) .",
    "the variety of ways the situation of forcing appears in many different levels of mathematical reasoning ( proof theory , logic , topos semantic , model theory ) causes it to seem to be really fundamental phenomenon .",
    "forcing , despite its formal shape , has very specific action over universes of set theory ( zf(c ) ) : it defines the relations between names of things , which are not present in the universe ( it means they are not sets in this sense ) such that the relations hold between sets ( whose names were considered ) in the enlarged universe .",
    "the procedure of enlargement with the preservation of theorems of zf(c ) , is just the forcing procedure . from the other perspective forcing",
    "is the recipe for proving theorems valid in enlarged universe ( which is a model of zf(c ) ) and not necessarily valid in the ground universe ( which is also a model of zf(c ) ) . in that way cohen",
    "was able to proove independence of continuum hypothesis ( ch ) and the axiom of choice ( ac ) from the axioms of zf .",
    "considered the situation of forcing in some approach to quantum logic .",
    "he was able to point out the place in quantum logic , where forcing , understood logically , fails to work .",
    "there are some indications coming from his analysis that :    \\(i ) set theoretical context is probably changing .",
    "\\(ii ) there are some `` preformal '' situations where nonstandard model of reals ( in the robinsonnian sense ) i.e. @xmath4 and standard one  @xmath5 , are `` identified '' ( or , in fact , @xmath6 and @xmath7 as models of peano arithmetic ( pa ) are identified ) . + in what follows we are to investigate both points .",
    "strikingly enough , this will lead us to rebirth of forcing in the context of qm and , in fact , forcing appears to be very intrinsic shape of quantum mechanical paradigm ; instead of being only formal construction in logic , or ql , it is to be considered as a tool allowing the change of metatheoretical universe and/or the way reals appear as possible results of experiments .",
    "in fact , both points ( i ) and ( ii ) intertwine in the specific way , which is well modeled locally by the model  theoretical constructions of bounded boolean ultrasheaf of superstructure modulo some ultrafilter @xmath8 in boolean algebra ( ba ) ( invented by ) ( see theorem3 ) .",
    "+ in this paper we show surprising correlation of formalism of qm with some structures which are modelled on forcing constructions in various of its facets .",
    "this is still more surprising , because it was shown by that the forcing formally does not work any more in ql ( what we have mentioned already ) .",
    "the missing link for appearing forcing in qm formalism could be non classical @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the rule is exactly as stated in the title , but it requires some explanation .",
    "firstly , the rule can not be formalized ; otherwise it would exist formal context where one could express : standard and nonstandard models of pa are different and ( according to the rule ) one can not express their difference  this is impossible . for , there does exist suitably higher order formal language ( in fact second order is enough ) , which expresses the difference between standard n and nonstandard n ; there would also exist an order , and the language of that order , which would express identity of both models .",
    "it is enough to take the language of order being maximal of both orders ( with appropriate symbols ) , to obtain contradiction .",
    "secondly , the rule is the heuristic statement only ; one can not prove it ( this would require some formal context ) . + in what follows",
    ", we give some possible formulations of the rule .",
    "_ in some formal constructions ( not necessarily connected with nonstandard naturals ) the appearance of nonstandard naturals is unavoidable and out of control by formal means of the construction . _    _ along with the shift of the language @xmath11 from the higher order into first order , we can not distinguish standard n from nonstandard n. there are such shifts which are not able to be described simultaneously in any formal language , which would be an extension of the language @xmath11 .",
    "_    _ for any given formal language ( of any order ) there exists a pair @xmath12 such that there does nt exist any formula @xmath13 ( with free variables from @xmath14 ) in this language , which would be expressing any difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "_    an analogy with manifolds can be usefull here : we have patches which are standard n or nonstandard n , but the transition functions between them can not be formalized simultaneously with pathes ( the language  logic is also to be shifted ) .",
    "such a thing we call _",
    "levelfold_.    as we will see , such a strange rule , called from now on @xmath9 @xmath10 , has much to do with formalism of qm .",
    "_ there does not exist any formal language which would be able both to describe language of pa ( counting formulas of it ) and to describe * all * models of pa ( there are some models of pa which can not be discribed simultaneously with the formal language of pa ) .",
    "_    in general one can say that non simultaneous ( in principle ) description of formal language and the models of the theory in this language ( which in fact is a core of @xmath9 @xmath10 ) is analoguos to non simultaneuos ( also in principle ) measurability of some physical observables .",
    "we will see what exactly is the formal content of this coincidence .",
    "we are ready to formulate some strange consequences of the main hypo .",
    "there is canonical bijection between morphisms of ultrafilters on @xmath17 and elementary embeddings of ultrapowers of @xmath15 .",
    "morphisms of ultrafilters induce the order , which is just rudin - keisler ( rk ) order .",
    "e - morphism ( end extension morphism ) is induced by being an initial segment of one ultrapower of @xmath15 in another .",
    "e - morpphism also induce e - order on ultrafilters on @xmath17 .",
    "this is stronger preorder then rk . ( another possible order is the order connected to conservative extensions of ultraproducts ; it is stronger then e - order .",
    "the strongest one is rudin - frolik order depicted as @xmath18 ( ) . was able to define rk order and rf order on ultrafilters in arbitrarily complete ba ) .",
    "what follows from @xmath19 order of ultrafilters over @xmath20 , taking not @xmath21 related ultrafilters we are led to * not end extensions * of nonstandard naturals .",
    "such an extension is to modify some initial segment of naturals ( nonstandard ) : @xmath22 \\subset { \\bf^\\ast n}$ ] in the sense that there is no 1 to 1 mapping @xmath23 : @xmath24\\not \\xrightarrow[into]{1:1 } [ 0',1',2', ... ,\\bar{n}']\\ ] ] such that @xmath25 .",

    "let @xmath34 be some maximal ba of projections from @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath34 is complete atomic boolean algebra .",
    "maximal algebra of projections in the lattice of projections over separable hilbert space can not serve as a forcing algebra for any nontrivial forcing over any ground model of zf(c ) .",
    "this is well known fact that forcing is not trivial ( properly extends the ground model ) iff the ba which corresponds to it is atomless ba ( ) .",
    "let us notice that atomic , complete bas fulfill infinite distributive law ( dl ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 are arbitrarily , possibly infinite , sets of indices and @xmath38 is any , double indexed family of elements of ba .",

    "remark : _ the peculiarity of theorem2 is in that even in the single measurement having got single `` real '' as a result , we already have corresponding probability distribution coming from the results of repeating measurements ( to be performed ) .",
    "the dynamics of shifts of zfc models is giving this situation , which in turn enables one to `` realize '' @xmath9 @xmath10 .",

    "finally , what does it mean that one can not measure non commuting @xmath39 and @xmath40 simultaneously ? .",
    "let us notice that reals @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath51 differ due cohen generic reals on the level of ground model @xmath45 .",
    "this means that we have to change the ground model along with the shift @xmath52 , where both algebras are treated as algebras of projections from @xmath32 .",
    "that means in turn , that to maintain indistinguishability of algebras , we have changed the meaning of the lattice of projections .",
    "thus we have reached the point where everything has changed the meaning ( even standard natural numbers from @xmath9 @xmath10 ) .    to try to see the difference between varying naturals or reals we trying to fix @xmath15 and @xmath5 and are going to employ the technique of bounded boolean ultrasheaf of superstructure modulo some ultrafilter in ba ( @xmath53 ) ( ) .",
    "@xmath53 is in fact based on generalization of ultraproduct modulo ultrafilter in @xmath20 ( ) into boolean ultraproduct modulo ultrafilter in ba in question ( ) .",

    "we have obtained the characterization of the spectrum of enlarged algebra coming from non compatible observables ( through @xmath9 @xmath10 ) .    in the measurement of non compatible observables as a result of the possible simultaneous measurement we would have real number and some ingeneric real corresponding to bounded boolean ultrasheaf of superstructure modulo some ultrafilter in ba  @xmath53 . that is why having both reals is not possible .",
