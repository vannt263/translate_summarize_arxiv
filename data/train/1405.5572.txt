    "in social and information networks , it is often necessary to gauge the general opinion of a large population on a certain issue .",
    "common examples include political polling and market survey of commercial products .",
    "since polling the opinion of a node in the network often incurs a cost ( either monetary or in terms of delay ) , an important question is how to infer the opinion of the entire network through strategically sampling a minimum subset of nodes by exploiting correlations in node opinions .",
    "this paper presents an algorithmic study of the strategic opinion sampling problem .",
    "we first introduce the concept of information dominating set ( ids ) .",
    "a subset of nodes in a given network is an ids if knowing the opinions of nodes in this subset is sufficient to infer the opinions of the entire network .",
    "we focus on two fundamental questions : ( i ) given a subset of the network , how to determine whether it is an ids ; ( ii ) how to construct a minimum ids ( i.e. , an ids consisting of a minimum number of nodes ) for a given network .",
    "the former is referred to as the ids checker ( idsc ) problem , and the latter the minimum ids ( mids ) problem .    while the concept of ids applies to general opinion and opinion correlation models , in this paper",
    ", we focus on binary opinions and adopt the local majority rule to model opinion correlation .",
    "specifically , each node in the network has a binary opinion that is consistent with the majority opinion of its neighbors .",
    "local majority rule is commonly used in studying opinion dynamics in social networks ( see , for example , ) . under the local majority model ,",
    "we show that for a general network , the idsc problem is co - np - complete and the mids problem is np - hard .",
    "we then focus on networks with special structures , in particular , acyclic networks .",
    "we show that in acyclic networks , both idsc and mids problems admit linear - complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the ids problem and the vertex cover problem .",
    "our technique for establishing the hardness of the ids problems is based on a novel graph transformation that transforms the ids problems in a general network to that in an odd - degree network .",
    "this graph transformation technique not only gives an approximation algorithm to our problem , but also provides a useful tool for general studies related to the local majority rule .",
    "furthermore , as a by - product of our complexity analysis , we show that it is np - complete to determine whether a network can be partitioned into two strong communities with the same size .",
    "this result may have implications in the general studies of community structures in social networks .    besides the applications in strategic opinion sampling for political polling and market survey , the concept of ids and the results obtained in this paper also bear significance in identifying critical nodes in information networks .",
    "identifying such critical nodes has important applications in learning and inference under resource constraints as well as security considerations in terms of protecting critical information hubs .",
    "the concept of information dominating set may also be used in data compression , given that an ids completely represents the information of the entire network .",
    "statistical sampling is a classic problem pinioned by neyman in 1934 @xcite .",
    "different from the deterministic model and the algorithmic approach taken in this paper , statistical sampling assumes that the value associated with each node a random variable obeying a known probability distribution and designing the sampling strategy amounts to choosing a probability with which each node will be sampled .",
    "more recent work on statistical sampling can be found in .",
    "there are several classic algorithmic problems that are related to the ids problem .",
    "the vertex cover ( vc ) asks for a ( minimum ) subset of vertices in a graph such that each edge is adjacent to at least one vertex in this subset .",
    "it was proven to be np - complete by karp @xcite .",
    "approximation algorithms with a near constant approximation ratio of @xmath0 were developed in @xcite .",
    "another related algorithmic problem is the dominating set ( ds ) problem which asks for a subset of vertices such that each vertex in a given graph is either in this set or adjacent to a vertex in this set .",
    "the ds problem is also np - complete and can be approximated within @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the ids problem studied in this paper is inherently more complex than vc and ds .",
    "for instance , as shown in this paper , it is co - np - complete to verify whether a given subset is an ids , while vc and ds have trivial polynomial time checker simply based on their definitions .",
    "further discussions on the connections and differences of ids to vc and ds are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : vcds ] .",
    "the local majority rule has been commonly adopted in studying opinion dynamics in social networks ( see , for example , ) .",
    "the focus of this line of work is on characterizing the evolution of network opinions when each node dynamically changes its opinion by following the majority opinion of its neighbors .",
    "the objective of this paper is different : we aim to infer the network opinions _",
    "after _ the opinion of each node has reached an equilibrium value .",
    "given a graph @xmath2 with @xmath3 vertices , a _ binary opinion profile _",
    "@xmath4 on @xmath5 is a binary vector @xmath6 indicating where @xmath7 represents the opinion of vertex @xmath8 . for",
    "a given a binary opinion profile @xmath4 on @xmath5 , the neighbors of a vertex @xmath8 are partitioned into two groups : the same - minded and opposite - minded neighbors , depending on whether they share the same opinion with @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : validassignment ] , the same - minded neighbors of @xmath9 are @xmath10 while its opposite - minded neighbor is @xmath11 .    a _ valid opinion profile _",
    "@xmath4 under the _ local majority rule _ in @xmath5 is a binary opinion profile such that for each vertex @xmath8 , the number of its same - minded neighbors is greater than or equal to the number of its opposite - minded neighbors . in other words ,",
    "the opinion of each vertex is consistent with the majority opinion among its neighbors . and",
    "if there is no such majority opinion , this vertex may take any opinion .",
    "fig  [ fig : validassignment ] demonstrates a valid opinion profile @xmath12 over the graph .",
    "the _ valid opinion profile set _",
    "@xmath13 of a given graph @xmath5 is the set of all valid opinion profiles on @xmath5 .",
    "an _ information dominating set _ ( ids ) in a given graph @xmath5 is a subset of vertices @xmath14 such that under any opinion profile , the opinions of vertices in @xmath15 is sufficient to infer the opinions of all the other vertices .",
    "based on the definition , ids has an important property as follows .",
    "[ pro : ids ] a subset of vertices @xmath15 in a graph @xmath5 is an ids if and only if for any pair of different valid opinion profiles @xmath16 , there exists a vertex @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "the significance of property  [ pro : ids ] is that it provides a way to determine whether a subset of vertices is an ids or not without considering any specific inferring method .",
    "it is used repeatedly in this paper .",
    "[ fig : ids ] demonstrates the valid opinion profile set @xmath13 on a graph and an ids @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on two problems on ids .",
    "the first problem , referred to as the ids checker ( idsc ) problem , is to determine whether a given set is an ids .",
    "the second problem we consider is the main objective of this paper , which is to find the minimum ids ( mids ) . in hardness analysis ,",
    "the corresponding decision problem is : given a graph @xmath5 and a parameter @xmath20 , whether there exists an ids @xmath15 in @xmath5 with size at most @xmath20 .      a vertex cover in a graph",
    "@xmath5 is a subset of vertices such that each edge is adjacent to at least one vertex in this subset , equivalently , any vertex in @xmath5 is either in this subset or all its neighbors are in this subset .",
    "it is easy to see that when the opinion correlation model is such that the opinion of one vertex can be completely determined by the opinions of all its neighbors , then a vc of @xmath5 is an ids of @xmath5 . under the local majority rule ,",
    "when a vertex has an even number of neighbors , its opinion may not be determinable even if the opinions of all of its neighbors are known .",
    "hence a vc is not an ids in general graphs . in the next section",
    ", we will propose an odd - degree graph transformation such that both idsc and mids problem in an arbitrary graph can be solved in an odd - degree graph as the result of the transformation . in the derived odd - degree graph ,",
    "a vc is an ids .",
    "however , even in odd - degree graphs , an ids may not be a vc , hence the minimum ids could be smaller than the minimum vc .",
    "a dominating set is a subset such that any vertex in @xmath5 is either in this subset or at least one of its neighbor is in the subset .",
    "it is can be seen that when the opinion correlation model is such that the opinion of one vertex can be completely determined by one of its neighbors , then a ds of @xmath5 is an ids of @xmath5 .",
    "as discussed above , under the local majority rule considered in this paper , the opinion of a vertex can not be completely determined by the opinions of all its neighbors .",
    "hence neither a vertex cover nor a dominating set is an ids under the local majority rule , and vice versa .",
    "consequently , the size of the minimum vc or the minimum ds in a graph has no direct relationship to the size of the minimum ids in general graphs .",
    "specifically , the size of the minimum ids could be larger than the minimum vc or smaller than the minimum ds ( note that a vertex cover is always a dominating set , hence the size of the minimum vc is no less than that of the minimum ds ) .",
    "[ fig : ids_vs_vc_ds2 ] demonstrates two examples illustrating the above statement .",
    "furthermore , the minimum ids problem is fundamentally different from both problems .",
    "based on the definition , one can easily check whether a given subset is a vc or ds in polynomial time , while in this paper , we show that to determine whether or not a give set is an ids is co - np - complete .",
    "this imposes difficulties on constructing approximation algorithms because most approximation techniques require a polynomial verifier for the problem .",
    "by the definition of valid opinion profile under the local majority rule , we may not be able to determine a node s opinion , even if we know the opinions of all its neighbors .",
    "such a case occurs when a vertex has the same number of same - minded and opposite - minded neighbors .",
    "for example , vertex @xmath21 in fig .  [ fig : validassignment ] can have an opinion of either @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this imposes difficulties on both the hardness analysis and algorithm design .",
    "however , this uncertainty of opinion only occurs if the vertex has an even number of neighbors . in an odd - degree graph where every node has an odd number of neighbors ,",
    "every vertex will have a unique majority opinion among its neighbors , hence its own opinion can be determined if the opinions of all of its neighbors are known .",
    "it thus follows that a vertex cover is an ids in the odd - degree graph .    in this section",
    ", we propose a way to transform an arbitrary graph @xmath5 to an odd - degree graph @xmath24 such that both the idsc and mids problem in @xmath5 can be solved by considering @xmath24 .    given an arbitrary graph @xmath2",
    ", we first copy every vertex and edge to @xmath24 . then , for every even degree vertex @xmath8 in @xmath24 , we attach an auxiliary neighbor @xmath25 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : oddtrans ] ) .",
    "we call @xmath24 the _ odd - degree transformation _ of @xmath5 . given any valid opinion profile @xmath26 in @xmath5 , we construct its odd - degree transformation opinion profile @xmath27 according the following equations : @xmath28 in other words , those vertices derived from the original graph take the original opinions , and every auxiliary vertex take the opinion of the vertex it attaches to .",
    "[ fig : oddtrans ] demonstrates an example of the odd - degree transformation from @xmath5 to @xmath24 and a valid opinion profile @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",

    "the above two lemmas establish a bijection between the set of valid opinion profiles in @xmath5 and @xmath24 , which serves as a bridge between an ids in @xmath5 and that in @xmath24 .",

    "[ thm : odt ] there exists an ids @xmath15 in @xmath5 if and only if there exists an ids @xmath32 in @xmath24 such that for any vertex @xmath33 , either @xmath34 or its auxiliary vertex @xmath35 .    based on theorem  [ thm : odt ] , for both the idsc and mids problems",
    ", it suffices to consider only odd - degree graphs . specifically , given a graph @xmath5 , a subset of vertices",
    "@xmath15 is an ids if @xmath15 is an ids in the odd - degree transformation of @xmath5 .",
    "and we can find the mids @xmath15 in @xmath5 by finding the mids @xmath32 in the odd - degree transformation of @xmath5 and mapping @xmath32 back to @xmath15 by the procedure in the second part of the above proof . unless otherwise noted , the graphs considered in the remaining part of this paper are all odd - degree graphs .",
    "in this subsection , we establish the co - np - completeness of the idsc problem . to achieve this",
    ", we introduce another decision problem in graphs called the _ strong community bisection _ ( scb ) problem . given a graph with an even number of vertices , the scb problem asks whether the graph can be partitioned into two strongly connected sub - graphs of equal size , where a sub - graph is called _ strongly connected _ if the internal degree of every vertex in this sub - graph is strictly greater than its external degree .",
    "we first show that the scb problem is np - complete even when all the vertices in the given graph have even degree",

    "the scb problem is clearly an np problem .",
    "we then focus on reducing a well - known np - complete problem to the scb problem in even degree graphs .",

    "the spp asks that whether a set of positive integers @xmath36 can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that the sum of the numbers in @xmath37 equals that of @xmath38 .",
    "given such a set of positive integers , we will construct a graph @xmath5 as follows .",
    "first , for each @xmath39 , we construct a sub - graph component with two identical cliques @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the sizes of both cliques are @xmath42 .",
    "then , we connect each vertex in @xmath40 to all vertices except its counterpart in @xmath41 . as a result",
    ", an integer @xmath43 is turned into a graph with @xmath44 vertices and each vertex has @xmath45 neighbors .",
    "[ fig : twocliques ] is an example of the graph component corresponding to @xmath46 .",
    "[ c]@xmath40 [ c]@xmath41    with all @xmath20 integers mapping to @xmath20 connected components , the graph @xmath5 simply consists of these @xmath20 disjoint components . since the component that corresponds to @xmath43 contains @xmath44 vertices , all with degree @xmath45 , graph @xmath5 is an even degree graph with an even number of vertices ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the following theorem establishes the correctness of this reduction .",
    "[ thm : spp2scb ] the set of positive integers @xmath48 has a equal sum partition if and only if graph @xmath5 has a strong community bisection .",
    "since the scb problem is clearly in the np space and the above reduction can be done in polynomial time , we conclude that the scb problem in even degree graphs is np - complete .",
    "the definition of ids does not imply that idsc is an np problem .",
    "however , a subset of vertices @xmath14 is not an ids if and only if there exists a pair of different valid opinion profiles @xmath49 such that the opinion profile on the subset @xmath15 are identical .",
