    "similar investigations have been carried out only for the decay of the @xmath1 metastable level ( santos 2001 ) as well as for the two  photon excitation from the @xmath2 ground states of hydrogen  like ions ( szymanowski 1997 ) . to the best of our knowledge , however , no attempt has been made so far to explore two and multi ",

    "a green s function approach is applied in section [ theory ] to perform the summation over the _",

    "using such an approach , cross sections for the two  photon ionization of the @xmath2 ground state of hydrogen  like ions are calculated for nuclear charges in the range @xmath3 in order to explore both , the relativistic contraction of the wave functions as well as those effects which arise from the higher multipoles in the decomposition of the radiation field , i.  e.  the so  called _ retardation effects_. section [ results ] , later , provides a comparison of the cross sections from the relativistic theory ( as obtained in two different approximations ) as well as from the scaling of non - relativistic results .",
    "finally , a few conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in second  order perturbation theory , the two  photon ionization cross section @xmath4 is given by ( laplanche 1976 )    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the wave functions and the energies of the initial , intermediate and final atomic states , respectively has the dimension length@xmath9time , it can easily be converted also to other units such as @xmath10 sec by using the _ conversion factor _",
    "1.89679 @xmath11 10@xmath12 . ] . in this expression , as usual , the electron ",
    "photon interaction is described in terms of the transition operator @xmath13 which includes the momentum @xmath14 of the electron and the photon wave @xmath15 . as appropriate for laser experiments , here and in the following",
    "we assume that both photons have equal wave vectors @xmath16 and equal helicities @xmath17 , i.  e.  that they have the same circular polarization .",
    "then , the energy @xmath18 of the emitted electron simply follows from the energy conservation and is given by the energy of the initial state and twice the photon energy @xmath19 .",
    "apart from the usual integration over the spatial coordinates , the evaluation of the transition amplitude in in eq .",
    "( [ crosssection ] ) also requires a _ summation _ over the complete spectrum of the ( hydrogen ) ion .",
    "obviously , this summation includes the sum over all discrete states as well as an integration over continuum .",
    "in particular the second part , i.  e.  the integration over the continuum , is rather difficult to carry out in practice since it implies the computation of _ free  free _ electronic transitions .",
    "an alternative to carrying out the summation over the spectrum explicitly in the transition amplitude is given by a change in the sequence of summation and integration from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "then , the summation over the complete hydrogen spectrum can be replaced by the coulomb green s function ( swainson and drake , 1991 ) @xmath22 which is zero at the origin and tends to zero if @xmath23 or @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this particular property of coulomb green s function ensures that the second - order transition amplitudes in ( [ crosssection ] ) can be evaluated even if the continuum wavefunctions @xmath25 remains oscillating at large @xmath26 .    using the green s function [ expansion ]",
    ", the ionization cross section ( [ crosssection ] ) can be re - written in the form ( maquet 1998 ) @xmath27 including a new _",
    "double _ integration over @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for hydrogen",
    " like ions , the coulomb ",
    "green s functions @xmath30 are known analytically , both within the nonrelativistic as well as the relativistic theory . based on the dirac ",
    "hamiltonian with a hydrogen potential , @xmath31 , a radial  angular representation of the relativistic coulomb ",
    "green s function was given earlier by swainson and drake ( 1991 ) .",
    "in the evaluation of matrix elements , such a representation allows for the analytic integration over all angles by using the techniques of racah s algebra , while the radial integration has  often  to be carried out numerically .      to evaluate the _ angular part _ of the transition amplitude in expression ( [ cs_greens ] ) , of course , we need first to represent the photon wave in terms of its electric and magnetic multipole fields ( rose 1957 ) @xmath32 where , for the sake of simplicity , we have taken the quantization axis , i.  e.the @xmath33axis , along the photon momenta @xmath34 . for a proper radial ",
    "angular representation of all coulomb wave and green s functions , then , the transition amplitude can be reduced to a ( finite ) sum of products of the type _ angular coefficient @xmath11 radial integral _ , in dependence on the number of multipoles and on further approximations which are made for the ( coupling of the ) radiation field . in our computations ,",
    "the angular coefficients were obtained algebraically , using the racah program ( fritzsche 1997 , fritzsche 2001 ) . for the radial integrals , in contrast",
    ", we applied the procedures from the greens library ( koval and fritzsche 2003 ) .",
    "owing to the structure of the radial green s function ( matrix ) this implies a double integration over a 2dimensional area in @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for which an adaptive numerical integration algorithm with a user  defined precision was developed .",
    "this algorithm is based on the gauss ",
    "legendre quadrature and has been implemented as well in the greens library .",
    "different approximations can be applied to investigate the two  photon ionization of hydrogen  like ions , in dependence on the photon frequency and the nuclear charge . in nonrelativistic quantum theory , for instance ,",
    "the total non  resonant cross section in the long  wavelength approximation is known to scale down like @xmath37 i.  e.  with the sixth power of the nuclear charge , if  at the same time ",
    "the photon energy is scaled with @xmath38 ( zernik 1964 ) .",
    "this scaling rule for the non  resonant part of the cross section applies for all photon energies @xmath39 below of the one  photon threshold of hydrogen @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ev refers to the hydrogen ground  state energy . to display the deviations of the cross sections in the different relativistic approximations from the nonrelativistic scaling , we may re  write eq .",
    "( [ nrel_scaling ] ) in the form @xmath42 where the photon energy @xmath43 now depends on the relativistic binding energy and , thus , shows a slightly more complicated @xmath44dependence than the nonrelativistic @xmath45 behaviour . as above",
    ", we may restrict ourselves to photon energies with @xmath46 below of the one  photon threshold of all hydrogen ions . with this definition of @xmath47 ,",
    "however , the interpretation of the scaling rule ( [ scaling_rel ] ) becomes quite simple as , say , a value @xmath48 obviously specifies the photon energy so , that the total energy of the two photons together exceeds the @xmath2 threshold by just 5% ; a definition which can be used also in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "thus , the _ net _ deviation between the various approximations is shown in the scaling factor @xmath49 which , in the nonrelativistic limit , is @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ f : low_energy ] displays the scaling factor @xmath49 as function of the nuclear charge @xmath51 for @xmath52 , i.  e.  for a two  photon excess energy of 5  % which is well within the non  resonant region .",
    "three different approximations are shown in this figure : apart from the trivial nonrelativistic factor @xmath53 , the scaling factors are given for the relativistic long  wavelength approximation @xmath54 ( dashed  dotted line ) as well as for the exact second  order perturbation treatment of all retardation effects ( solid line ) . in practice , only the multipole fields up to @xmath55 are needed in ( [ photon_expansion ] ) in order to obtain convergence of the corresponding cross sections at about the 1% level .    when compared with the nonrelativistic decrease of the two  photon ionization cross sections , owing to the @xmath56 scaling of the cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ nrel_scaling ] ) , a further significant reduction arises for multiple and highly  charged ions mainly because of the relativistic contraction of the wave functions towards the nucleus .",
    "this contraction can lower the cross sections easily by a factor of two or more in the high  z domain .",
    "the incorporation of higher multipoles beyond the e1e1 dipole approximation , in contrast , contributes even for large values of @xmath57 only to @xmath58 5% for photon energies near the two  photon threshold .",
    "somewhat larger retardation effects , however , are found for higher photon energies .",
    "for a two  photon excess energy of , say , 40  % above the threshold [ cf .",
    "figure [ f : high_energy ] ] , the _ retarded _ two  photon cross sections ( solid line ) are now larger than the cross sections in the long  wavelength approximation with deviation up to about 30  % at the high@xmath0 end of the sequence . the behaviour of the retarded cross sections with respect to the long  wavelength approximation clearly shows the importance of higher multipoles which , otherwise , are usually seen only in angle  differential measurements ( surzhykov 2002 ) .",
    "in conclusion , the non  resonant two  photon ionization of hydrogen  like ions has been studied in detail within the relativistic theory .",
    "emphasize was placed , in particular , on the relativistic contraction of the wave functions as well as on the retardation in the cross sections which arise from higher multipoles of the radiation field .",
    "however , our computations also showed that a green s function approach may provide a reliable access to second  order properties other than the total two  photon ionization cross sections .",
    "investigations on the angle  differential emission of electrons as well as the two  photon decay of few ",
    "electron ions are currently under work .",
    "this work has been supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) within the framework of the schwerpunkt wechselwirkung intensiver laserfelder mit materie.",
