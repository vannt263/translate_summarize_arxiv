    "semileptonic and radiative beauty decays play an important role in the determination of the ckm matrix elements and in the indirect search for new physics : the former , tree - level dominated , allow for a precise measurement of the ckm elements @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; the latter , loop - induced , are directly sensitive to new physics contributions , and give also information on @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these decay modes , all characterized by an electroweak current that probes the @xmath0 dynamics , have a lot in common and form a remarkable set of interdependent measurements .",
    "their simplicity , however , is only apparent : if one is interested in precision measurements they display all the rich complexity specific of qcd dynamics .",
    "the main theoretical divide runs between inclusive and exclusive decays : inclusive decays can be studied using an operator product expansion ( ope ) , parameterizing the non - perturbative physics in terms of @xmath0-meson matrix elements of power - suppressed local operators , while exclusive decays require an estimate of the form factors using non - perturbative methods ( lattice qcd , sum rules ) .",
    "having two completely different methods at our disposal represents a huge advantage and makes non - trivial cross - checks possible .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the exclusive determination of @xmath5 employs the extrapolation of the @xmath6 rate to the kinematic endpoint where the @xmath7 is produced at rest ( zero - recoil ) . in this limit ,",
    "the form factor @xmath8 is known , up to corrections suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath9 that have to be computed , e.g.  on the lattice .",
    "since one needs to estimate only the @xmath10 correction to the heavy quark limit , a good accuracy can be reached even with present non - perturbative methods .",
    "in fact , current lattice qcd and sum rule results are both consistent with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the overall uncertainty is therefore close to 5% : @xmath12 , but the two most precise experimental results , by babar and cleo , differ by almost 3@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "semileptonic decays to @xmath14 mesons give consistent but less precise results .",
    "progress is expected especially from unquenched lattice calculations .",
    "while the non - perturbative unknowns in the exclusive determination of @xmath5 have to be calculated , those entering the inclusive semileptonic decay , @xmath15 , can be measured in a self - consistent way .",
    "indeed , the inclusive decay rate depends only on the hadronic structure of the decaying @xmath0 meson , but the sensitivity to it is actually suppressed by two powers of @xmath16 , as the highly energetic decay products are ( generally ) unable to probe the long wavelengths characteristic of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "formally , an ope allows us to write the differential @xmath15 rate as a double series in @xmath17 and @xmath16 , whose leading term is nothing but the parton model result .",
    "however , the ope results for the spectra can be compared to experiment only after smearing over a range of energies @xmath18 and away from the endpoints .",
    "the hadronic mass spectrum , for instance , is dominated by resonance peaks that have no counterpart in the ope : the ope results have no _ local _ meaning .",
    "the observables that can be studied in the ope include the total rate and moments ( weighted integrals ) of the lepton energy and hadronic mass spectra , as well as the photon spectrum in radiative decays .",
    "they generally are subject to a lower cut on the charged lepton energy and can be written in a way analogous to that of the integrated rate , @xmath19,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the tree - level expression , @xmath22 contains the leading electroweak corrections , the wilson coefficients @xmath23 are series in @xmath17 , and power corrections up to @xmath24 have been kept .",
    "the parameters entering the predictions are @xmath17 , properly defined _ quark _ masses @xmath25 , and the @xmath0 meson matrix elements of the four _ local _ operators that appear up to @xmath26 : @xmath27 and @xmath28 . because they depend on the various parameters in different ways , the moments serve a double purpose : they allow to constrain the non - perturbative parameters and they test the overall consistency of the ope framework .",
    "effects that can not be described by the ope ( and therefore violate _ parton - hadron duality _ ) and higher order power corrections can be severely constrained .",
    "recent experimental results @xcite , analyzed in the light of up - to - date theoretical predictions @xcite , have led to a big step forward , both in completeness and accuracy .",
    "there is a remarkable consistency of a variety of leptonic and hadronic moments , leading to an excellent fit .",
    "the values of the quark masses are in agreement with lattice and spectral sum rule determinations , and the other non - perturbative parameters are determined for the first time at the 10 - 20% level , in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "radiative moments from belle , cleo , and babar @xcite can be included as well without deteriorating the quality of the fit , that yields @xmath29 @xcite , in agreement with the exclusive result .",
    "the estimate of the theory error ( missing higher order perturbative and non - perturbative contributions , intrinsic charm etc . ) is particularly delicate ; different recipes in different schemes @xcite have led to compatible results . despite recent progress @xcite , higher order perturbative corrections to the wilson coefficients",
    "are the main source of uncertainty : a 1% determination of @xmath5 is possible but requires new calculations . it should be stressed that the ope parameters describe _ universal _ properties of the @xmath0 meson and of the quarks .",
    "for example , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are determined in the fit within less than 40 and 30 mev , resp .",
    "the reach of the new results therefore extends well beyond the @xmath5 determination , as is well demonstrated by the case of @xmath32 .",
    "the ratio @xmath33 measures the left side of the unitarity triangle , identifying a circle in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "the determination of @xmath32 from @xmath35 semileptonic decays parallels that of @xmath5 , but the exclusive determination ( @xmath36 , etc . )",
    "is penalized by the absence of a heavy quark normalization for the form factors at a certain kinematic point . moreover ,",
    "if theoretical precision is lower , so is statistics , by about two orders of magnitude .    in view of the precision reached by @xmath5 , a drastic improvement in the determination of @xmath32 , made possible by the high statistics available ,",
    "has become the top priority .",
    "the relevance of @xmath32 is is illustrated for instance in fig .  1 , where the unitarity triangle is determined for the first time using tree - level processes only .",
    "comparing a high precision determination of this kind , insensitive to new physics , to the standard one based on loop processes would be very instructive @xcite .",
    "in the exclusive case , lattice qcd and light cone sum rules complement each other , but as the first unquenched calculations appear , the error in the high-@xmath37 region accessible to lattice still exceeds 10% , while the @xmath37 extrapolation is well under control , thanks to analyticity and new experimental data @xcite .",
    "sum rules prefer a lower value than lattice , @xmath38 ( first of @xcite ) against @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the goal of lattice simulation is a 5 - 6% determination within a few years @xcite .",
    "recent proposals include a new @xmath40 form factor normalization based on scet @xcite , and the combination of @xmath41 and @xmath42 data @xcite .",
    "the latter is not yet competitive and the @xmath32 result could depend on new physics in the rare decay .",
    "the inclusive determination of @xmath2 is strongly affected by the kinematic cuts necessary to isolate @xmath35 transitions from the dominant @xmath43 background . in general , cuts placed near the perturbative singularities ( typically , the lepton energy endpoint ) destroy the convergence of the ope and introduce a sensitivity to local @xmath44-quark wave function properties like the fermi motion of the heavy quark in the @xmath0 meson .",
    "these non - perturbative effects are not suppressed by powers of @xmath45 : at leading order in this expansion they are described by a single distribution function , often called _ shape function _ ,",
    "whose first moments are given by expectation values of the same _ local _ operators we have encountered earlier .",
    "the shape function is universal : in principle it can be extracted from the photon spectrum in @xmath46 or studying the differential distributions in @xmath47 , although the two processes are different at subleading order in @xmath45 and @xmath17 .",
    "the shape function gets renormalized by perturbative effects : disentangling the latter from non - perturbative contributions is not trivial and has been done in different ways @xcite .",
    "different cutting strategies have been proposed : cuts on the hadronic invariant mass @xmath48 , on the electron energy , on the @xmath37 of the lepton pair and combinations thereof , on the light - cone variable @xmath49 ; each has peculiar experimental and theoretical systematics @xcite , though the uncertainty on leading and subleading shape functions plays often a central role .",
    "eventually , the variety of complementary approaches that have been developed will be extremely useful .",
    "recent theoretical work has focused on the optimization of the cuts , subleading non - perturbative effects @xcite , the resummation of sudakov logs , the role of the radiative decay spectrum in constraining the shape function , etc . @xcite .",
    "the latest hfag average of inclusive determinations , @xmath50 @xcite agrees with the exclusive determination based on lattice .",
    "the error is close to 8% and dominated by theoretical systematics .",
    "the progress since last year is significant and due to : i ) the implementation of the constraints on @xmath30 and on the moments of the shape function derived from @xmath51 spectral moments ; ii ) larger statistics and better knowledge of the charm background , that has allowed to cut in a milder way , to the relief of theorists .",
    "further improvement can be expected from high statistics data . a more precise determination of the radiative spectrum and better experimental constraints on the weak annihilation ( wa ) contributions @xcite are needed .",
    "particularly promising are new analyses based on fully reconstructed events that allow high discrimination of charmed final states .",
    "they allow the measurement of @xmath52 decay distributions well beyond the kinematic cuts on @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "of course for milder cuts the experimental error tends to increase , while the sensitivity to the shape function decreases : the balance between theoretical and experimental errors can be optimized .",
    "the @xmath52 differential distributions and their truncated moments will help constraining the shape function(s ) , weak annihilation ( wa ) contributions , and the heavy quark parameters @xcite .",
    "while the v - a current involved in the semileptonic @xmath0 decays is conserved , that is not the case of the tensor current that induces radiative decays . as a consequence ,",
    "these decays depend logarithmically on the electroweak scale at which the current is generated by @xmath53 and top quark loops : in addition to the @xmath44 mass and the scale of qcd , a third scale @xmath54 must be taken into account . the large logs @xmath55 are resummed in the context of an effective theory , at leading order in @xmath56 : the resummation of @xmath57 term corresponds to the leading order ( lo ) expression , of @xmath58 terms to the nlo , etc . apart from this complication , and from additional ones due to the presence of charm loops @xcite , the ope for _ inclusive _ radiative decays is analogous to the one for semileptonic ones .",
    "the nlo calculation was practically completed in 1996 @xcite and involves @xmath59 matrix elements .",
    "electroweak effects and power corrections are also known @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical uncertainty in the nlo analysis of the branching ratio ( br ) is related to the mass of the charm quarks circulating in the @xmath59 loops of the matrix element @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this matrix element vanishes at lo , and the charm dependence is an @xmath59 effect . the _",
    "natural _ scale at which @xmath61 should be normalized is therefore undetermined without and @xmath62 calculation .",
    "the matter is quite relevant : the numerical difference between @xmath63  gev and @xmath64  gev is large enough to shift the br by more than 10% .",
    "using @xmath65 as central value , the br of @xmath46 for @xmath66  gev is @xmath67 , with an error close to 8% @xcite , dominated by the charm scale uncertainty . in practice , a lower cut on the photon energy ( @xmath68 - 1.9  gev )",
    "is always applied to avoid background .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the tail of the spectrum is therefore required for the extrapolation to a region where the ope can be trusted . the same problem also affects the moments of the photon spectrum that are employed in the hqe fit @xcite . both perturbative hard gluon emission and the tail of the shape function concur to form the tail of the photon spectrum . as already mentioned , disentangling them is not straightforward .",
    "the transition from the shape function dominated region to the local ope has been studied by neubert , who found that it can be described by a multi - scale non - local ope @xcite .",
    "he noticed that the cut @xmath69 effectively introduces two new scales that may be relevant besides @xmath30 : @xmath70 and @xmath71 . according to this picture",
    ", the perturbative tail of the spectrum receives contributions at the scale @xmath72 , and may be subject to large higher order perturbative corrections , even for @xmath73  gev , simply because @xmath72 is then close to 1  gev .",
    "this view has been criticized @xcite .",
    "certainly , the results of a new calculation of the dominant @xmath62 effects in the photon spectrum @xcite show only very small deviations from the lo plus blm perturbative spectrum considered in @xcite , excluding large corrections in the standard picture",
    ". moreover , the partial br calculated in the multiscale ope , br(@xmath66  gev)= @xmath74@xmath75 @xcite has a central value very close to that of @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath30 and @xmath76 extracted from the first and second photonic moments in @xcite following @xcite are also very close to those extracted from the same data using the multiscale ope @xcite .",
    "one would conclude that the local ope is likely to provide a good description of the spectrum in the intermediate region @xmath77",
    "gev of phenomenological interest , and that there is no need to enlarge substantially the theoretical error on the partial br given in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to compare different experiments ,",
    "the cut rates are usually extrapolated to a conventionally defined _ total _",
    "rate @xcite .",
    "the nlo result @xmath78 @xcite can then be compared with the experimental world average : @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "no deviation from the sm is observed , but in view of the final accuracy expected at the @xmath0 factories the theoretical prediction has to be improved . that is the aim of the nnlo calculation currently under way @xcite . to date , the missing pieces of this challenging enterprise include the four loop anomalous dimension matrix and the finite parts of the three loop matrix elements with charm loop .",
    "the high precision of inclusive radiative @xmath80 decays is not yet matched by the theoretical understanding of _ exclusive _",
    "radiative @xmath0 decays @xcite , despite some recent progress @xcite . because of the difficulty of measuring inclusively @xmath81 , the ratio of @xmath81 over @xmath82 exclusive modes is extremely interesting .",
    "@xmath83 has just been measured for the first time @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath84 , in particular , is hardly affected by wa contributions , while the su(3 ) breaking effects can be estimated on the lattice and using light cone sum rules ; the error is 10 - 20% at most @xcite . in this way",
    ", we can extract @xmath85 before @xmath86 is measured .",
    "while the 2004 preliminary result showed an interesting deviation from the global ut fit , the recent belle update has restored consistency with the sm and damped enthusiasm @xcite .",
    "finally , it should also be mentioned that the rare leptonic transitions @xmath87 complement radiative decays in constraining new physics @xcite . the inclusive decay @xmath88 , in particular , has reached experimental and theoretical maturity with theoretical errors comparable to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the joint theoretical and experimental effort to study semileptonic and radiative decays to high precision has led to relevant progress in the determination of the ckm matrix elements and in testing the standard model .",
    "table 1 summarizes the present theoretical uncertainty and outlines the main ingredients necessary to improve on it for the various processes .",
    "while no deviation from the standard model has been so far uncovered , more theoretical work is needed to make the most of the wealth of data coming from the @xmath0 factories .",
