    "r0.25        in the single diffractive dissociation process in proton - proton scattering , @xmath2 , at least one of the beam hadrons emerges intact from the collision , having lost only a small fraction of its energy and gained only a small transverse momentum . in the analogous process involving virtual photons , @xmath0 ( figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) @xcite , an exchanged photon of virtuality @xmath3 dissociates through its interaction with the proton at a squared four momentum transfer @xmath4 to produce a hadronic system @xmath1 with mass @xmath5 .",
    "the fractional longitudinal momentum loss of the proton during the interaction is denoted @xmath6 , while the fraction of this momentum carried by the struck quark is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "these variables are related to bjorken @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "diffractive interactions are often discussed in the framework of regge phenomenology  @xcite in terms of the exchange of a ` pomeron ' with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "this interpretation in terms of a universal exchange is experimentally supported by the ` proton vertex factorisation ' , which holds to good approximation over much of the accessible kinematic range at low @xmath6 , whereby the dependences on variables describing the soft interaction with the proton ( @xmath6 , @xmath4 ) factorise from those related to the hard interaction with the virtual photon ( @xmath7 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "similar reactions , in which sub - leading reggeon and pion trajectories are exchanged , have a negligible cross section at the smallest @xmath6 values .",
    "significant progress has been made in understanding diffraction in terms of qcd by studying virtual photon dissociation in deep inelastic electron - proton ( @xmath10 ) scattering ( diffractive dis ) at hera .",
    "a recent review can be found at  @xcite . as well as being sensitive to novel features of parton dynamics in the high density , low @xmath8 regime ,",
    "diffractive dis cross sections are used to extract diffractive parton density functions ( dpdfs ) @xcite , an essential ingredient in predicting many diffractive processes at the lhc and in estimating backgrounds to more exotic processes such as central exclusive higgs production ( @xmath11 )  @xcite .    similarly",
    "to inclusive dis , cross section measurements for the reaction @xmath12 are conventionally expressed in terms of the reduced diffractive cross section , @xmath13 , which is related to the measured cross section by @xmath14 \\ \\",

    ", we tackle the technical issue of compatibility between different @xmath13 data sets through detailed comparisons between different measurements by the h1 and zeus collaborations and take the first steps towards a combined hera data set .",
    "experimentally , diffractive @xmath10 scattering is characterised by the presence of a leading proton in the final state retaining most of the initial state proton energy , and by a lack of hadronic activity in the forward ( outgoing proton ) direction , such that the system @xmath1 is cleanly separated and @xmath5 may be measured in the central detector components .",
    "these signatures have been widely exploited at hera to select diffractive events by tagging the outgoing proton in the h1 forward proton spectrometer or the zeus leading proton spectrometer ( proton - tagging method  @xcite ) or by requiring the presence of a large gap in the rapidity distribution of hadronic final state particles in the forward region ( lrg method  @xcite ) . in a third approach ( @xmath5 method  @xcite )",
    ", the inclusive dis sample is decomposed into diffractive and non - diffractive contributions based on their characteristic dependences on @xmath5 .",
    "the kinematic coverages of the lrg and @xmath5 methods are limited to @xmath17 by the need to contain the system @xmath1 in the central detector components .",
    "these two methods are equivalent for @xmath18 , but differences are to be expected at larger @xmath5 , where the lrg method measures the full cross section from all sources at a given ( @xmath19 ) point , whereas the @xmath5 method involves the subtraction of a ` non - diffractive ' component .",
    "lps and fps data extend to @xmath20 and are therefore the most sensitive to non - leading contributions , including reggeon and pion trajectory exchanges . apart from the proton dissociation treatment in the h1 case ( see section  [ sec : h1lrg ] ) , the cross sections measured by the proton - tagging and lrg methods are equivalent .",
    "the methods differ substantially in their dominant sources of systematic uncertainty . in the lrg and @xmath5 methods ,",
    "the largest uncertainties arise from the admixture of low mass leading baryon systems other than protons .",
    "these include proton excitations to low mass states as well as leading neutrons produced via charge exchange reactions .",
    "all such contributions are collectively referred to here as ` proton dissociation ' , @xmath21 , with the baryon state @xmath22 having mass @xmath23 .",
    "proton dissociation processes can not always be distinguished by the lrg and @xmath5 methods from events in which the proton is scattered elastically .",
    "conversely , low-@xmath6 samples selected by the proton - tagging method have little or no proton dissociation background , but are subject to large uncertainties in the proton tagging efficiency , which is strongly dependent on the proton - beam optics .",
    "proton spectrometers also allow a measurement of @xmath4 , but the statistical precision is limited by their small acceptances .",
    "comparing the results from the three different methods is a powerful test of the control over the systematics of the measurements . at low @xmath6",
    ", the ratio of results obtained by the lrg and @xmath5 methods to those from the proton - tagging method can also be used to quantify the proton dissociation contributions in the former samples .",
    "a comprehensive comparison has been carried out between recent h1 and zeus measurements obtained with the three different methods .",
    "the data sets used are as follows .",
    "method results obtained from 1999 - 2004 running @xcite . ]    * three data sets collected with the zeus detector in the years 1999 and 2000 .",
    "overlapping samples have been analysed with the zeus leading proton spectrometer ( termed * `` zeus lps '' * , based on a luminosity of 32.6 pb@xmath24 )  @xcite , with the lrg method ( * `` zeus lrg '' * , 62.4 pb@xmath24 )  @xcite and with the @xmath5 method , relying on the forward plug calorimeter ( * `` zeus fpc i '' * , 4.2 pb@xmath24  @xcite and * `` zeus fpc ii '' * , 63.4 pb@xmath24  @xcite ) . *",
    "a set of data collected with the h1 forward proton spectrometer ( * `` h1 fps '' * , 28.4 pb@xmath24 ) @xcite in the years 1999 and 2000 . * a set of data collected with the h1 detector in the years 1997 , 1999 and 2000 and analysed with the lrg method ( * `` h1 lrg '' * , 2.0 pb@xmath24 , 10.6 pb@xmath24 and 61.6 pb@xmath24 for small , intermediate and large @xmath3 , respectively)@xcite .    the h1 lrg and fps samples are statistically independent and are only weakly correlated through systematics .",
    "the three zeus samples also have different dominating systematics , but are not statistically independent .",
    "about 75% of events are common to both the zeus lrg and zeus fpc ii data sets and 35% of the zeus lps events are also contained in the zeus lrg sample .",
    "r0.5        in proton dissociation processes at the lowest @xmath23 , the dissociative system @xmath22 often escapes entirely undetected into the forward beam - pipe . as @xmath23 increases , it becomes more likely that dissociation products are detected in the instrumentation most sensitive to forward energy flow .",
    "the lrg and @xmath5 methods therefore do not distinguish low @xmath23 proton dissociation events from the case in which the proton is scattered elastically .",
    "different cross - section definitions have been adopted , in which the proton dissociation contribution is either subtracted statistically , or else the quoted results are integrated over a specific range of @xmath23 . since understanding the proton dissociation contributions and the corresponding corrections is fundamental to comparisons between the different measurements , a detailed discussion is presented in the following .    in both the zeus lps and the h1 fps analyses , the contribution from proton dissociation events is negligible at small @xmath25 . at the largest @xmath6 values , it becomes kinematically possible for the detected leading proton to be the result of a decay of an @xmath26 or other proton excitation , the remaining decay products being unobserved .",
    "this background was estimated by zeus to contribute around 9% at @xmath27 , using the pythia monte carlo ( mc ) model  @xcite . in the h1 fps analysis , using the rapgap  @xcite implementation of the diffvm proton dissociation model  @xcite , it was estimated to reach @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "proton dissociation contributions in the lrg and @xmath5 methods can be controlled using dedicated proton dissociation simulations tuned in @xmath23 regions where dissociating protons leave signals in the detectors , and extrapolated into the @xmath23 regions where the dissociation products are typically not detected .",
    "in addition to this procedure , both h1 and zeus use standard simulations of non - diffractive processes to control the small migrations of very high @xmath23 or @xmath6 events into the measurement region , which occur due to inefficiencies of the forward detectors .",
    "hr0.5        in the recent zeus analysis ,",
    "the pythia simulation was tuned to proton dissociation signals .",
    "two samples were selected by requiring activity either in the forward plug calorimeter ( fpc ) or at relatively low proton energy in the lps .",
    "the samples thus include the low @xmath23 region in which proton dissociation products are invisible to the central detector .",
    "the generated distributions were reweighted in @xmath23 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 to best describe the energy distribution in the fpc ( @xmath30 ) , and the scattered proton energy fraction distribution ( @xmath31 ) in the lps .",
    "figures  [ fig : pythia]a and  [ fig : pythia]b show the comparison of the reweighted pythia model with the two proton dissociation samples as a function of these variables .",
    "also shown in figures  [ fig : pythia]c - e is the resulting estimate of the fraction of proton dissociation events in the lrg sample as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "this fraction , obtained separately from the fpc and lps samples , is constant at the level of @xmath32%",
    ". the ratios of cross sections extracted from the zeus lps and lrg data ( the latter uncorrected for proton dissociation background ) , are shown in figure  [ fig : ratiozeus ] .",
    "there is no significant dependence on @xmath3 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , illustrating the low @xmath6 compatibility between the two methods .",
    "the ratio averages to @xmath33 , the last error reflecting the normalisation uncertainty of the lps data .",
    "the proton dissociation background fraction in the lrg data is thus @xmath34% , in agreement with the result of the mc study , @xmath35% ( figure  [ fig : pythia ] ) .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the zeus lrg data are corrected by this factor in the following and thus correspond exclusively to the truly proton - elastic process .      the contribution from proton dissociation in the h1 lrg analysis",
    "is constrained through the diffvm mc  @xcite model , normalised using the response to large @xmath23 events leaving signals in the forward and central detector components @xcite .",
    "the data are corrected using diffvm to @xmath36  gev .",
    "the h1 lrg data are then compared with the h1 fps measurement , in order to extract the proton dissociation cross section with @xmath37 directly from the data .",
    "the ratio of the two measurements , after projection onto the @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes , is shown in figure  [ fig : ratioh1 ] .",
    "there is no evidence for any dependence on any of the kinematic variables . as expected in the framework of proton vertex factorisation . the average value of the ratio is @xmath38 , the largest uncertainty arising from the fps efficiency .",
    "the result is in good agreement with the diffvm estimate of @xmath39 .",
    "the data and diffvm ratios translate into proton dissociation background fractions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , consistent within the uncertainties .",

    "proton dissociation events with sufficiently large @xmath23 for dissociation products to reach the fpc and central detectors lead to a reconstructed @xmath5 value which is larger than the actual photon dissociation mass .",
    "the resulting distortion of the @xmath44 distribution affects the diffractive contribution extracted in the fit if corrections are not made . according to the sang mc model",
    ", the @xmath22 system contaminates the @xmath5 reconstruction for @xmath45 gev on average  @xcite , and events in this @xmath23 range are therefore subtracted using sang before the @xmath44 distribution is decomposed .",
    "the upper @xmath23 cut in the sang sample is defined by @xmath46 , which leads to a variation of the subtracted fraction of events with @xmath47 , the centre - of - mass energy of the photon - proton system .",
    "this contrasts with the lrg method , where mc studies confirm that the rapidity gap requirement efficiently eliminates proton dissociation at large @xmath23 , the remaining fractional low @xmath23 contribution being independent of kinematics to good approximation ( figures  [ fig : ratiozeus ] and [ fig : ratioh1 ] ) . despite these difficulties",
    ", there is acceptable agreement between the zeus fpc data and the zeus lrg measurement .",
    "a global fit comparing the normalisations of the two data sets ( after correcting the lrg data to @xmath42 ) yields a normalisation factor of 0.83 @xmath48 0.04 to be applied to the zeus fpc results .",

    "due to their differing @xmath23 coverages , the @xmath13 measurements from the different data sets are not directly comparable . however , assuming the factorisation of the @xmath23 dependence which is suggested in the data , varying the @xmath23 range should introduce only global normalisation differences , which can be estimated using the proton dissociation simulations .",

    "the overall agreement between the two measurements is good , apart from some differences at large @xmath51 .",

    "the zeus results are extracted at the same @xmath7 and @xmath3 values as h1 and are therefore not affected by extrapolation uncertainties .",
    "the shape agreement is satisfactory and the overall normalisation discrepancy of around @xmath52% lies within the large combined normalisation uncertainty of around @xmath53 .",

    "the zeus data remain higher than those of h1 by @xmath56 on average , as estimated with a global fit comparing the normalisations of the two data sets for @xmath57gev@xmath58 .",
    "this normalisation discrepancy is similar to that between the h1 fps and the zeus lps data sets .",
    "it is in line with the errors due to the @xmath59 uncertainty on the proton dissociation correction in the zeus lrg data and the @xmath60 combined relative normalisation uncertainty between the two lrg data sets .    in figure",

    "for easy future consumption at the lhc and elsewhere , it is desirable to combine the various h1 and zeus diffractive dis measurements into a single easily digestible hera data set .",
    "here we take the first steps towards this goal , by making a simple error - weighted average of the h1 and zeus lrg data sets , ignoring correlations between the data points due to the systematic errors .",
    "lps and @xmath5 method data are not considered at this stage . for the purpose of this exercise ,",
    "the zeus normalisation is fixed to that of h1 as described in section  [ lrgcomp ] and shown in figure  [ fig : comp_lrg ] .",
    "the normalisation of the combined data thus has an uncertainty beyond the @xmath64 level .",
    "combinations can only meaningfully be made where there is basic agreement between the different measurements . since this is not always the case at the lowest @xmath6 values , we restrict the averaging to the @xmath65 and @xmath66 data .",
