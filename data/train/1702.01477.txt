    "deuteron structure has been studied by hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "the deuteron is a bound state of proton and neutron mainly in s wave . in fact",
    ", the experimental magnetic moment of deuteron supports the s - wave idea , whereas the existence of a finite electric quadrupole moment indicates that the deuteron should also contain d wave .",
    "therefore , the deuteron is an s - d mixture state , and the d - wave contribution is very small so as to be consistent with the magnetic and quadrupole moments .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the tensor structure in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "about 10 years ago , the hermes collaboration made the first measurement of the tensor structure function @xmath0 for the deuteron @xcite .",
    "however , the measurement shows that @xmath0 is much larger than the convolution - model prediction with the s - d mixture @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the tensor structure of deuteron is not understood in the parton level .",
    "there are other theoretical works on the deuteron @xmath0 by including shadowing phenomena , pions , and hidden - color state @xcite .",
    "there is an approved experiment to measure @xmath0 by the electron deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at jlab ( thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ) and it will start in a few years .",
    "this accurate experiment will help us to understand the tensor structure of deuteron .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 is expressed by the tensor - polarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) ; however , the separation of antiquark distributions is not obvious solely from the dis measurements .",
    "since the understanding of the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions could be essential for clarifying the discrepancy between the conventional theory and the hermes data , it is important to measure them experimentally . fortunately , it is possible in the fermilab - e1039 experiment by the drell - yan process with a tensor - polarized deuteron target .",
    "the purpose of our research is to calculate the tensor - polarized spin asymmetries of the drell - yan process @xcite because there was no theoretical estimate to be used for an experimental proposal and future comparison with the data .",
    "the tensor structure of the deuteron can be investigated in charged - lepton dis with the polarized deuteron , and it is shown in the fig .",
    "the hadron tensor of the deuteron is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are deuteron mass , deuteron momentum , and virtual - photon momentum , @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate spin states of the deuteron , and the details of other notations are found in refs .",

    "\\label{eqn : e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , a nonzero measurement of @xmath0 integral indicates the existence of finite tensor - polarized antiquark distributions , in the similar way that the gottfried sum - rule violation indicated a finite @xmath20 distribution @xcite .",

    "it should be also noted that the measured hermes @xmath0 values are much larger in magnitude than the standard convolution - model estimates , and it may be considered as a deuteron tensor - structure puzzle . in any case , the antiquark distributions can be measured directly in the drell - yan process , which could lead clarification of the puzzle .",

    "the tensor - polarized distributions at other energy scales can be obtained by the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) evolution equations @xcite in the same way with the unpolarized pdfs @xcite .",

    "the scale 2.5 gev@xmath23 is the average @xmath57 value of the hermes experiment , and 30 gev@xmath23 is roughly the average @xmath57 value of the fermilab drell - yan experiment . even after the @xmath57 evolution , the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions are very small , since they are set to be 0 at the initial scale .",

    "we find that the spin asymmetries are a few percent for both sets .",
    "if @xmath41 is very small , the differences between the set-1 and the set-2 results are large .",
    "this is because the spin asymmetries @xmath63 are very sensitive to the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions in this region as indicated in eq.([eqn : e5 ] ) .",
    "the set-2 asymmetries should be more reliable since the existence of finite tensor - polarized antiquark distributions is in agreement with the hermes data .    in order to indicate typical errors of our estimates , we show the asymmetries @xmath63 in fig.[30gev ] at the typical energy scale @xmath56 gev@xmath23 . even if the error bands are considered , the asymmetries are of the order of a few percent and they obviously deviate from 0 .",
    "it validates the importance of the fermilab drell - yan experiment to probe the tensor structure of the deuteron , in particular the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions .",
    "in addition to the fermilab - e1039 experiment , such a drell - yan experiment is possible at hadron - accelerator facilities such as bnl - rhic , cern - compass , j - parc , gsi - fair , and ihep in russia . the structure function @xmath0 can be measured also at the future eic .",
    "the studies of the tensor structure functions will become one of interesting topics of hadron physics in a few years , much theoretical studies are needed to clarify the tensor structure in the quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "the tensor - polarized parton distributions are important physical quantities , and they can reflect interesting dynamical aspects of deuteron including the d - wave contribution . the tensor structure of the deuteron can be studied by dis and drell - yan process , while it is much easier to get the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions in the drell - yan process . in this work ,",
    "the tensor - polarized spin asymmetries @xmath65 were theoretically calculated for the proton - deuteron drell - yan process in the parton model , and we obtained a few percent values .",
    "we also found a finite tensor - polarized gluon distribution due to @xmath57 evolution .",
    "we hope that the fermilab - e1309 experiment will be realized and a new field of hadron spin physics will be explored in future .",
