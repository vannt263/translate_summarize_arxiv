    "traditionally photoproduction and dis are considered as processes which are governed by different underlying physics . whereas most of the features of dis processes can be described in terms of perturbative qcd , photoproduction is dominated by non - perturbative effects .",
    "this point of view seems to be justified by the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath2 cross section which exhibits a clearly visible transition region between photoproduction and dis at about @xmath6 . on the other hand , the steady transition from photoproduction to dis highlights the importance of obtaining a description which smoothly links the non - perturbative and perturbative domains , see for example @xcite .",
    "there exist now high precision deep inelastic lepton scattering data @xcite covering both the low @xmath0 and high @xmath0 domains , as well as measurements of the photoproduction cross section @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we discuss a simple qcd - motivated parametrisation of the observed @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath2 cross section , which is closely related the average transverse momentum of secondary particles produced in the photon hemisphere .",
    "in addition , the question of the hard scale in deep - inelastic scattering is discussed within the framework of @xmath7 factorization .",
    "let @xmath9 be the total cross section for the process @xmath10 where @xmath0 is the virtuality of the photon and @xmath11 is the @xmath12 centre - of - mass energy . for @xmath13",
    "the @xmath14 fluctuations occur over a much longer time scale than the interaction of the @xmath15 pair with the target proton .",
    "therefore the @xmath2 cross section is well approximated by the probability @xmath16 of the @xmath17 transition multiplied by the imaginary part of the forward amplitude describing the @xmath15-proton interaction m ( a_q|q + p ) = s _",
    "q|q + p  , [ eq : b12 ] where @xmath18 is the cross section for the scattering of the @xmath15 system on the proton .",
    "for transversely polarized photons the amplitude of the @xmath17 transition reads @xmath19           \\delta_{\\lambda,-\\lambda^\\prime }          + \\lambda m_q \\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda^\\prime } }           { \\bar{q}^2 + k_t^2 } ,        \\label{eq : a13}\\ ] ] where the @xmath20 and @xmath21 longitudinal momentum fractions and transverse momenta are @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",

    "@xcite , which is based on the earlier work of ref .",
    "namely @xmath24 and the photon polarization vectors are given by @xmath25 and where @xmath26 according to whether the @xmath27 helicities are @xmath28 .    in terms of the quark momentum variables we thus obtain @xmath29k^2_t+m^2_q}{(\\bar{q}^2 + k^2_t)^2 }       \\",

    "to @xmath36 one gets of ( [ eq : b12 ] ) .",
    "however it is known , both from experiment and from triple regge theory , that such non - diagonal transitions are suppressed in the forward direction . in terms of the additive quark model",

    "[ eq : b17 ] this can be compared with the corresponding expression of the generalized vector dominance model @xcite @xmath37 where the spectral function @xmath38 represents the density of @xmath15 states .",
    "a similar dispersion relation has been used , for example , in @xcite to describe the structure function @xmath39 over the full @xmath0 range . in comparison to ( [ eq : a12 ] )",
    "we see that ( [ eq : b17 ] ) is a two - dimensional integral .",
    "to see the reason for this let us consider massless quarks .",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between the @xmath20 and the @xmath42 in the @xmath15 rest frame .",
    "the @xmath43 integration is implicit in ( [ eq : a12 ] ) as the integration over the quark angular distribution in the spectral function @xmath38 .    at first sight the @xmath0 dependence of the cross section ( [ eq : a12 ] ) should be @xmath44 .",
    "this is true if one deals with only one vector meson or when the dominant contribution in ( [ eq : a12 ] ) comes from a limited range of @xmath31 . on the other hand when all the possible values of @xmath31 are taken into account",
    "the result is _ ^ * p = 1q^2+m_0 ^ 2 .",
    "just such a behaviour is expected in our approach ( see sect .  3 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : b20 ] ) ) .    to obtain a complete description of the @xmath2 cross section a deed model for the @xmath33-proton interaction",
    "is needed .",
    "such a model is developed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , longitudinally polarized photons have to be considered .",
    "however for our phenomenological discussion it is sufficient to investigate some general features of ( [ eq : a16 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a16 ] ) comes mainly from the two quark propagators @xmath45 where in the r.h.s . of the last equality we neglect the small quark mass ( @xmath46 ) in the @xmath24 term . in order to demonstrate the expected @xmath0 behaviour of the cross section ( [ eq : a16 ] )",
    "let us first write the expression in the simplified form _",
    "_ t^p(q^2 ) ^1/2_0 and perform the @xmath43 integration .",
    "it gives the result _",
    "_ t^p(q^2 ) 1k^2_t(q^2 + 2k^2_t ) 1q^2 + 2k^2_t .",
    "it can be checked by explicit numerical integration that the @xmath47 dependent part of the integral ( [ eq : a16 ] ) j_=^1_0 dz is well approximated by j_app.=  .",
    "the ratio @xmath48 tends to 1 in the asymptotic limits @xmath49 or @xmath50 and reaches a minimum of about 0.96 at @xmath51 .    using this approximation ( [ eq : a16 ] )",
    "can be written as _ _",
    "t^p(s , q^2 ) & = & n_c_q d(k_t^2 ) k_t^2_q|q+p(s , k_t^2 ) + & & n_c_q _ q|q+p(s , )  , [ eq : b19 ] where @xmath52 is the characteristic transverse momentum of the quark . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b19 ] ) the @xmath0 dependence is almost factorised and is mainly given just by the factor @xmath53 .",
    "now let us discuss the structure of the integral ( [ eq : b19 ] ) over @xmath54 .",
    "of course the large distances , i.e. very small @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is of the order of nucleon radius @xmath57 ) are suppressed by the confinement . at very large @xmath58 based on the perturbative qcd and neglecting the anomalous dimension one expects the cross section @xmath59 .",
    "thus in the ultraviolet region ( at @xmath60 ) the integral ( [ eq : b19 ] ) is convergent .",
    "the main contribution comes from the mediate ( more or less soft ) @xmath61 gev@xmath4 interval .",
    "typically the cross section is large in the soft region , where it falls down with @xmath7 exponentially ; then at @xmath62 gev ( corresponding to a small distances ) it has the power - like tail .",
    "note that the predicted behaviour _ ^ * p1q^2 + 3 [ eq : c40 ] does not depend too much on concrete form of the @xmath15 cross section . as an extreme example",
    "let us consider a simple `` soft '' approximation _",
    "q|q+p(s , k_t^2 ) = _ 0(s ) ( k_t^2-^2 ) ( -k_t^2 ) which corresponds to soft scattering where the quark - proton cross section is saturated for @xmath63 and vanishes everywhere else .",
    "then the @xmath2 cross section reads _ _ t^p(s , q^2 ) _ 0(s ) ( ) .",
    "[ eq : b21 ] despite of the fact that ( [ eq : b21 ] ) takes now a logarithmic form for the numerical values for @xmath64 discussed in the following ( [ eq : b21 ] ) predicts almost the same @xmath0 behaviour ( [ eq : c40 ] ) as eq .",
    "( [ eq : b19 ] ) .",
    "one has to expect also that the characteristic value @xmath65 should increases with energy . for larger collision energies",
    "the evolution chain ( which produces finally the wee parton ) becomes longer . at each step of evolution",
    "a new parton is emitted and the active parton gets some extra transverse momentum .",
    "therefore , as in the case of multiple small angle scattering in a thick target , the final intrinsic @xmath7 of the active parton grows with the number of interactions ( the number of evolution steps ) . in the framework of perturbative qcd this growth",
    "is originated in the summation of the double logarithmic contributions of the type @xmath66 and is described in terms of the anomalous dimensions . due to the larger value of anomalous dimension @xmath67 at higher energies",
    "one expects the larger characteristic value @xmath52 .",
    "finally we will neglect the weak logarithmic @xmath0 dependence of @xmath52 in ( [ eq : b19],[eq : c40 ] ) ( which is , of course , not excluded completely ) and try to describe the data with the parametrisation _",
    "t(^*p ) 1q^2+q^2_0 [ eq : b20 ] using @xmath68 given by the characteristic value @xmath65 of the quark transverse momentum q_0 ^ 2 3  .",
    "[ eq : c1 ] the value of @xmath69 becomes unimportant for large @xmath0 so we use the value of @xmath65 as determined at small @xmath0 ( say , in photoproduction at @xmath70 ) .",
    "since the integral ( [ eq : b19 ] ) over @xmath71 has a logarithmic structure one can not estimate the characteristic value of @xmath52 through the average of @xmath71 .",
    "multiplying the integrand by an extra power of @xmath71 destroys the whole structure of the integral and enlarges crucially the essential values of @xmath71",
    ". therefore we estimate @xmath52 by averaging the logarithm of the squared transverse momentum = ( ( k^2_t ) )  .    of course , one can not measure directly @xmath71 of a quark .",
    "so we have to relate the @xmath7 of the quark jet to the transverse momenta @xmath72 of secondary hadrons in the photon fragmentation region .",
    "contrary to the large @xmath73 jet fragmentation here ( for not too large @xmath7 ) the value of @xmath72 is not so small in comparison with @xmath7 .",
    "if one assumes that in photoproduction both values ( @xmath7 of the quark and @xmath72 of secondary hadrons ) are controlled by the typical temperature @xmath74 then we may expect that our @xmath65 is close ( or equal ) to the average @xmath75 of secondary hadrons ( in the photon fragmentation region ) . to understand better",
    "the relation between the values of @xmath65 and @xmath76 we use a standard monte carlo program which is in agreement with fixed target and hera photoproduction data , in particular with the measured transverse is momentum spectra of secondaries .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the phojet ( which , of course is not excluded completely ) event generator @xcite are given in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] for two energies at which inclusive transverse momentum distributions of secondaries have been measured @xcite .",
    "indeed for the photon fragmentation region ( @xmath77 ) the @xmath76 of secondary hadrons in non - diffractive events is close to the parton @xmath65 and increases with energy .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the same parton - parton rescattering may explain at least part of the growth of @xmath69 with the energy ; due to the fact that at large energies ( small @xmath79 ) the parton density increases and even in the case of a single proton the parton - parton interaction becomes not negligible .    in terms of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : a12 ]",
    ") one can say that in dense matter ( heavy nuclei or large @xmath11 ) the effective mass ( @xmath31 ) of @xmath15-pair increases .",
    "the point - like ( large @xmath31 ) configurations with a small cross section which penetrate a thin target without any interaction are absorbed by a dense target and give an essential contribution to the cross section .",
    "at low @xmath79 photon  proton scattering can be understood as the fluctuation of the virtual photon into a hadronic state and the subsequent scattering of this state on the proton .",
    "we have shown that cross section data on fixed target and hera deep - inelastic scattering support this interpretation .    on this basis ,",
    "a simple parametrisation of the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath2 cross section has been derived .",
    "the essential parameter @xmath68 of this parametrisation can be estimated from the measurement of secondaries produced in the photon fragmentation region .",
    "this data analysis also confirms the prediction of the @xmath7 factorization approximation that the hard scale of the process is not the initial photon virtuality @xmath0 but the parton @xmath7 of the hadronic fluctuation . of course",
    ", the essential values of @xmath71 are correlated with @xmath0 but neither directly equal nor proportional to @xmath0 . instead , the correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath0 is rather broad . therefore , in order to fix the hard scale of the deep - inelastic process it is better to use the transverse energy ( @xmath73 ) measurements in the photon fragmentation region , than the value of the colliding photon virtuality .",
    "fixing the hard scale by high @xmath72 secondary hadrons from the photon fragmentation region instead of the photon virtuality @xmath0 , a faster transition to hard scattering has been observed @xcite .",
    "finally , we may say that the cross section fits presented in this work suggest that low-@xmath79 deep inelastic scattering is characterized by rather `` soft '' ( corresponding to @xmath81 gev@xmath4 ) quark - nucleon ( @xmath82 ) interactions .",
