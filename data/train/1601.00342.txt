    "is expected in quantum dots compared to their bulk counterparts  @xcite .",
    "lead chalcogenide qds have been intensively studied in relation to meg since the first demonstration of meg in pbse quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "these quantum dots are known to exhibit high confinement effects combined with a small band gap of bulk materials , e.g. @xmath3 ev for pbs and @xmath4 ev for pbse at room temperature  @xcite . for a small lead based quantum dot",

    "apart from lead based dots , cadmium chalcogenide quantum dots , indium based quantum dots ( inas and inp ) and silicon quantum dots have been studied for exploring the efficiency of meg in quantum dots  @xcite . from an experimental perspective , very short time resolution and very low excitation fluence are two requirements that needs to be fulfilled when measuring meg quantum yield  @xcite .",
    "the first requirement is due to the rapid auger recombination ( @xmath7 ps )  @xcite for multi - excitons in quantum dots in comparison to lifetime of single excitons ( @xmath7 ns )  @xcite . to be able to capture these fast processes , techniques with time resolution much faster than the recombination times",
    "is needed .",
    "ultrafast lasers can produce pulses as short as @xmath8 fs or less in duration which offer adequate time resolution needed @xcite .",
    "the second requirement is to avoid multi - exciton formation due to successive excitation of quantum dots with two or more photons within the life time of a single exciton .",
    "the observation of multi - exciton recombination at low pump fluence can then be considered as the signature for meg .",
    "ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy , which is a pump probe technique , is one of the mostly used experimental techniques for measuring meg @xcite .",
    "meg in quantum dots has been simulated by several groups , with a strong focus on the impact ionisation process .",
    "@xcite used a time dependent density matrix approach to study efficient meg in nanocrystals as a coherent superposition of single and multi - exciton states and showed that efficient meg is a consequence of suppressed thermalization rate of the initially excited single exciton .",
    "@xcite showed that experimentally observed meg yield in pbse nanocrystals can be explained by impact ionisation process which is very efficient in pbse and pbs nanocrystals with very fast ( @xmath9 fs ) lifetime for the single exciton to relax into the double exciton . beard _",
    "@xcite compared meg in nanocrystal with impact ionisation in bulk and showed that the calculated quantum yield for nanocrystals is much larger than its bulk counterpart .",

    ", we perform a quantum kinetic description based on a selected set of microscopic single particle states similar to @xcite . however , we work in the corresponding many - body basis , which allows for a better identification of the exciton states .",

    ", the transient changes to the single exciton and double exciton states by the light pulse can be examined to see the various intermediate processes before the system relaxes to its ground state .",
    "since the transient properties depend highly on the different parameters which can be controlled by suitable experimental setup , understanding these processes at the microscope level can greatly benefit for optimizing meg experiments .",

    "meg by impact ionisation is resulting from the coulomb electron - electron interaction which is highly enhanced in quantum dots due to the high overlap of states . here",
    "we calculate the corresponding matrix elements for a cuboid geometry which has a volume equivalent to the volume of a 4 nm spherical quantum dot .",

    "we estimate that the corresponding error is comparable to others resulting from the simplified screening with constant @xmath30 and the use of envelope functions .",
    "the general expression for the coulomb matrix element is given by the integral : @xmath31 which enter the hamiltonian in occupation number representation as @xmath32 in eq.([eq : matrixelement ] ) a screening length @xmath33 was assumed which is a length much larger than the dimension of the dot .",
    "this has no significant effect on the overall result of the integral .",
    "as it will be described below , the evaluation of the coulomb matrix element involve an integral in fourier space where @xmath34 stabilizes the numerics .",
    "in addition , a relative permittivity of @xmath35 was used  @xcite . the integral in eq.([eq : matrixelement ] ) is solved by splitting it into parts which involve @xmath36 and @xmath37 and taking the fourier transform of the screened coulomb potential .",

    "however if they originate from different bands , the evaluation is more complicated . in this case",
    ", one has to consider a multi - band model . in this work ,",
    "a two band model @xcite was used for evaluating the integral which involve the conduction and valence bands .",
    "the result gives a prefactor times the integral of the corresponding intraband pair with this prefactor being a constant proportional to the interband dipole matrix element times the wave vector @xmath43 .",

    "these direct terms are the strongest ones with calculated values of the order of @xmath47 mev .",
    "the other types of elements which are of interest are the scattering terms @xmath48 which account for several different types of interactions . the matrix element @xmath49 , which couples the single exciton and the double exciton for meg ( auger term ) , is of the order of @xmath50 mev .",
