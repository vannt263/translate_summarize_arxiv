    "the larger spiral galaxies of the local group , the milky way , m31 and m33 , are growing through mergers with smaller systems . m31 and",
    "m33 contain numerous stellar streams @xcite , and the milky way is currently accreting the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , the smith cloud , and probably the magellanic stream as well @xcite .",
    "m31 , m33 , and the milky way are also surrounded by clouds of neutral and ionized gas  the `` high velocity clouds '' ( hvcs )  that are not identifiable with any stellar system and may be dark matter subhalos , material stripped from satellites , accretion from a hot halo or the intergalactic medium , or something else entirely @xcite .",
    "braun & thilker ( 2004 , hereafter b&t ) mapped the hi  over a large area around m31 and m33 , and reported the detection of extremely faint 21 cm hi  emission at the level log(n@xmath14 @xmath2 that formed a partial bridge about 200 kpc in extent between the two galaxies .",
    "this gas lies well outside each galaxy s hvc system and has been interpreted as the neutral component of an intergalactic filament , or the remnant of a past encounter between m31 and m33 ( b&t ; * ? ? ?",
    "discussion of the likelihood and consequences of an interaction between m33 and m31 are given in recent papers by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for convenience we will refer to the structure reported by b&t as the m31 `` bridge '' .",
    "b&t made their measurements using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope configured as a group of single dishes to obtain very high sensitivity to low surface - brightness hi  emission , but at the expense of angular resolution .",
    "they further smoothed the data in angle and velocity to detect this extremely weak emission more easily : their final maps had 49  angular resolution , equivalent to 11 kpc at the distance of m31 , and a velocity resolution of 17 km s@xmath15 .",
    "even so , much of the signal they reported was just @xmath16 to @xmath17 above the noise .",
    "although they obtained a spectrum with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) that was consistent with their westerbork `` single dish '' measurements at one location , over much of the field the detections are only marginally significant .",
    "subsequently , @xcite questioned the existence of this hi  bridge , noting its absence from the immediate vicinity of m33 at the level log(n@xmath18 in data from the arecibo radio telescope , and suggested that the b&t result might be blended galactic hi  mistakenly attributed to m31 or m33 .",
    "hi  is typically the most massive component of tidal tails ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the existence of a neutral hydrogen bridge between m31 and m33 may be key in understanding the evolution of both galaxies . to determine the reality of the bridge , and to study its properties at significantly higher angular resolution than b&t",
    ", we have observed a large area between m33 and m31 using the green bank telescope at a factor @xmath19 better resolution in angle and velocity . as importantly , the very clean optics of the gbt @xcite greatly reduces the chances that any faint 21 cm detection is a spurious signal that originates from the bright hi   disks of m31 or m33 and has entered the receiver through a sidelobe .",
    "spectra in the map presented here have a @xmath7 sensitivity limit of log(n@xmath20 , so the gas in the b&t bridge would not be detected if it is smoothly distributed on scales @xmath21 kpc ) , but our hope was that the bridge would have much brighter small - scale structure , unresolved by the @xmath22 observations of b&t , but well resolved by the @xmath0 beam of the gbt .",
    "in addition to the map , three directions were selected for very deep observations capable of detecting hi  emission at the level log(n@xmath23 .",
    "if the hi  structure between m31 and m33 is actually diffuse , i.e. , not highly spatially structured , and at the brightness implied by the b&t measurements , the emission would not be seen in the map , only in the deep pointings .",
    "the goals of this project are thus : 1 ) to search a wide area between m31 and m33 for evidence of the hi  bridge arising from clumps in the gas , and 2 ) to measure the hi  at several locations at a sensitivity similar to that of b&t but with much greater angular resolution as a check on the basic existence of the bridge .",
    "additional measurements were made toward two of m31 s dwarf galaxies that lie within the mapped region .",
    "the observations are discussed in  [ sec : obs ] , results toward the dwarfs and  ii and and  xv are presented in  [ sec : dwarfs ] , hi  emission that is widespread across the field but probably not related to the m31 bridge is discussed in  [ sec : v-200 ] , results that pertain to the hi  bridge are presented in  [ sec : detections ] , the present measurements are discussed in relation to the hvc systems of m31 and m33 in  [ sec : hvcs ] , and the concluding discussion is in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "an area of approximately 50 square degrees between m31 and m33 was observed with the 100-meter diameter robert c. byrd green bank telescope @xcite , at an angular resolution of @xmath0 using the l - band receiver , which has a typical system temperature at zenith of 18 k in both linear polarizations .",
    "all observations were made over a bandwidth of 12.5 mhz at a channel spacing of 0.16 km  s@xmath15 . during the data reduction spectra",
    "were smoothed to coarser velocity resolution using a boxcar function and resampled .",
    "spectra were edited , then calibrated and corrected for stray radiation as described by @xcite , though at the velocities of interest here stray radiation is negligible .",
    "all intensities quoted here are brightness temperatures ( t@xmath24 ) averaged over the @xmath0 main beam , corrected for atmospheric absorption .",

    "early suggestions of @xmath25 `` gain fluctuations '' in 21 cm spectra @xcite have not been confirmed in a series of rigorous checks @xcite , while hundreds of thousands of hi  spectra have been measured by different groups with accuracies limited only by noise , or quantifiable effects such as instrumental baseline variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "conversion of velocities to heliocentric and local group standard of rest ( lgsr ) were made using the apex velocity and coordinates given by @xcite . for our data the uncertainties in the resulting v@xmath29",

    "the gbt was used to map 21 cm hi  emission over a large area between m33 and m31 guided by the b&t results . for convenience ,",
    "the survey region was divided in blocks of @xmath30 .",

    "each position in a block was observed for 6 seconds , and each block was observed as many as six times .",
    "data were acquired during more than two dozen independent observing sessions over a period of 20 months .",
    "in - band frequency switching gave a useable velocity coverage between -600 and + 470 km s@xmath15 ( lsr ) .",
    "the spectra were smoothed from their intrinsic velocity resolution of 0.16 km  s@xmath15 to 2.90 km  s@xmath15 , and a 3rd order polynomial was fit to emission - free portions of each spectrum .",
    "the data were assembled into a cube as described by mangum et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and @xcite , and a third order polynomial was removed from each pixel .",
    "the spectra suffered from occasional narrow - band interference generated within the gbt receiver room .",
    "these signals were stable in frequency and appeared in only one spectral channel , so spectra were interpolated over the affected channels .    occasionally , during some of the frequency - switched scans , one of the linearly polarized receiver channels had a poor spectral baseline likely caused by out - of - band interference .",
    "while it was possible in the `` follow - up '' and `` deep '' pointings to examine the data minute - by - minute for problems , the data over the mapped region consists of many tens of thousands of short measurements , and scrutiny of individual raw spectra was impractical .",
    "for this reason we retained only data from the good receiver channel for use in the maps .",
    "this problem did not appear in data taken by position switching .",
    "a channel map at a v@xmath28 that is free from 21 cm emission ( except for m33 ) is shown in figure [ fig : coverage ] .",
    "the rms noise over most of the map in a 2.9 km  s@xmath15 channel is @xmath33 mk except for the blocks at j2000 @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where because of reduced integration time the noise is 44 mk .",

    "the arecibo galfa - hi observations of the m33 region @xcite have a much higher angular resolution than those presented here ( 34 against 91 ) , but the gbt map spectra have a factor @xmath37 lower noise , giving our observations essentially equal sensitivity for structures with an angular size @xmath38 , and a factor of 6 more sensitivity to emission on scales @xmath39 . the measurements of the galaxy m33 that resulted from our survey will be described elsewhere .",
    "each location in the gbt map where 21 cm emission was detected at v@xmath40 km s@xmath15 at the @xmath41 level was re - observed in pointed , frequency - switched observations for 8 minutes .",
    "these spectra have a @xmath7 sensitivity to a 25 km s@xmath15 line of @xmath42 @xmath2 .",
    "two of m31 s dwarf galaxies that are within the boundaries of the map were also observed in this mode , and  ii and and  xv . because and  ii has a velocity similar to that of extended hi  features in its direction , an area around that dwarf galaxy was mapped with one minute integrations .",
    "this is discussed in   [ sec : andii ] .",
