    "we have performed _ ab initio _ full - potential augmented plane waves ( flapw ) @xcite calculations ( within density functional theory @xcite ) for gasb / insb and inas / insb systems , in order to examine the valence band offset ( vbo ) at strained [ 111 ] heterojuctions . to our knowledge , only recently have cupt - like ( _ i.e. _ [ 111 ] ordered ) systems begun to be investigated @xcite and the way the charge readjustment occurs at the interface is still far from being clear , mostly due to the non - trivial electrostatics involved .",
    "although both the [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] directions are polar ( the [ 110 ] is non - polar ) , there are important differences between interfaces oriented along these two crystallographic axes .",
    "first of all , the particular geometry for the [ 111 ] superlattice leads to two inequivalent interfaces : @xcite consider the structure for the ( gasb)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 superlattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( note that the common cation case has the same structure , except for the atomic species involved ) . according to convention",
    ", we have placed the interface planes @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) at the center ( sides ) of the interface insb ( gasb ) axial bond ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . observe that the interface sb is coordinated with three ga atoms and one in atom in one interface ( @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and with three in atoms and one ga atom in the other ( @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we could have , in principle , two different valence band offsets and charge accumulations ( @xmath5 ) at the interface planes @xmath3 and @xmath2 , namely @xmath6 , because of charge neutrality requirements .",
    "@xcite incidentally , we note that this is not the case for the [ 001 ] ordered systems , where the bond directions and the atomic coordinations result in exactly equivalent interfaces at the center and at the sides of the unit cell .    furthermore , since the semiconductor constituents ( with zincblende structure ) are piezoelectric materials , @xcite a uniaxial strain along the [ 111 ] direction leads to a strain induced piezoelectric polarization @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite following the notation of ref .",
    ", we obtain : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the piezoelectric constant and @xmath10 is the off - diagonal strain tensor element . as a function of the in - plane strain ( @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the substrate and equilibrium bulk lattice constants , respectively ) and within the linear regime , @xcite the strain tensor component can be expressed as : @xmath14    the piezoelectric effect can generate electric fields so that : @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dielectric polarization and @xmath17 is the dielectric susceptibility .",
    "note that for strained layer superlattices ( sls ) with [ 001 ] growth axis , the strain tensor is diagonal , so that @xmath7 vanishes .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we discuss results obtained for common  cation and common  anion strained layer superlattices grown along the [ 111 ] direction and discuss the effects of the strain induced polarization on the properties of the superlattices . in sect .",

    "iii and iv we briefly review the electrostatics involved ; in sect .",
    "v we discuss how charge redistributes at the interface and how the vbo can be evaluated . finally , in sect .",
    "vi we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we have studied the sl systems ( gasb)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 and ( inas)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 with unit cells containing 12 atoms ( as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ) . for this",
    "we have considered an ac / bc type heterojunction ( the case of the common anion ab / cb type heterojunction is exactly equivalent ) grown on different substrates : ( @xmath18 ) on a bulk ac semiconductor ( _ i.e. _ @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the ac semiconductor equilibrium lattice constant ) ; ( @xmath21 ) on a bulk bc semiconductor ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) ; ( @xmath23 ) on a substrate having an average lattice parameter ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24 ) ) . the structural parameters for the different systems considered were determined according to the macroscopic theory of elasticity ( mte ) and are equal to those for the ultrathin 1x1 [ 111 ] ordered sls of ref . .",
    "with this choice , we are not considering any internal strain @xcite which would produce different bond lengths @xcite for bonds parallel to the [ 111 ] and the other directions .",
    "@xcite of course , we expect that variations in the bond lengths may greatly affect the magnitude of the electric fields ; very large deviations may even cause a sing change .",
    "however , all this will not change the basic electrostatics involved and , as we will show , the physical quantities we are interested in , such as the vbo .",
    "we performed all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite to density functional theory with the exchange and correlation potentials as parametrized by hedin and lundqvist .",
    "@xcite technical details ( such as wave function cutoff , special k - points mesh etc . )",
    "are equal to those used in a previous study and reported elsewhere .",
    "@xcite in order to check the convergence of the valence band offset as a function of the cell dimension , we also performed calculations for ( gasb)@xmath25/(insb)@xmath25 and ( inas)@xmath25/(insb)@xmath25 sls grown on the same substrates .",
    "since they are important quantities for determining valence band offsets , we report in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the common atom sb ( in ) core level binding energies @xmath26 for the gasb / insb ( inas / insb ) [ 111 ] ordered sls grown on an average substrate . in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) , we also report the core level binding energies for 3x3 [ 001 ] ordered inas / insb grown on an average substrate .",
    "first of all , we point out that while in the 4x4 structures the @xmath26 are perfectly aligned on a straight line in the bulk region , the same behaviour is not so obvious to extrapolate in the 3x3 structures , due to the smaller bulk region",
    ". however , in what follows , we will assume the linear behaviour also for these structures and verify the validity of this assumption afterwards , when comparing the vbos obtained . from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we observe that the structures considered show electric fields with opposite signs at the two sides of the interface .",
    "the slopes of the linear trends of figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] give a rough estimate of the absolute values of the electric fields ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "our calculations give about 3x10@xmath28 v / m ( 12x10@xmath28 v / m ) in both the gasb ( inas ) and insb sides of the common anion ( cation ) heterojunction , with an error bar @xmath29 2x10@xmath28 v / m .",
    "note that this large error bar is due to the very small variations ( in particular for the common anion case ) of @xmath26 in the bulk region , which are of the same order of magnitude of our numerical uncertainty upon the core level binding energies themselves .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the plot of the core level binding energies for [ 001 ] strained layer sls leads to a constant trend ( implying a constant value of @xmath26 ) , as the @xmath30 coordinate ( perpendicular to the interface ) is varied within each semiconductor bulk region ; this confirms the absence of electric fields in the [ 001 ] ordered structures .",
    "as already pointed out , @xcite [ 111 ] ordered strained sls show electric fields , due to piezoelectricity . thus",
    ", elementary electrostatics of dielectric media leads to the following relation between the macroscopic quantities in each semiconductor constituent @xmath31 : @xmath32 due to symmetry properties , the transverse ( _ i.e. _ parallel to the interface ) component of the piezoelectric polarization vector vanishes ; thus , in the following , we will only consider the longitudinal ( _ i.e. _ perpendicular to the interface ) component of the electrostatic quantities involved .",
    "the net charge accumulation at an ideal abrupt interface is related to the macroscopic polarizations in the two semiconductor constituents , through the following relation : @xcite    @xmath33    since the perpendicular component @xmath34 is continuous across the interface , eq .",
    "( [ deq ] ) gives : @xmath35 so that eq.([sigma ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath36 in addition , from eq.([sigma ] ) and using eq.([ps ] ) , we obtain an equivalent expression for @xmath5 : @xmath37 \\cdot \\hat{{\\bf n } } \\label{eqsigma2}\\ ] ] note that , in the case of growth on a substrate equal to one of the constituent materials , only one side of the interface is strained and gives rise to a non - vanishing strain polarization @xmath7 . on the other hand , in the case of growth on an average substrate , @xmath7 is non - zero and will have opposite signs in the two different materials .",
    "in fact , the piezoelectric constants @xcite have the same sign for all the materials involved , while the two constituents are in biaxial tension and compression , respectively , leading to in - plane strains @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with opposite signs .    in order to test the validity of the above description , we have performed the double macroscopic average ( @xmath40 ) @xcite of the self consistent total ( electrons + ions ) charge density ( @xmath41 ) for some of the cases considered .",
    "we have estimated the net interface charge accumulation from the following relation : @xmath42 where the integration is performed between the two bulk regions ( referring to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the 3x3 case , between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .    we must point out that the use of the symbol @xmath5 for the charge accumulation does not necessarily imply that this charge must have a surface - like distribution .",
    "in fact , the electrostatics used so far , holds for any volume distributed charge density .",
    "however , as will be discussed later , the charge distribution at the interface can be reasonably approximated as a planar charge .",
    "( [ mediamacro ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqsigma1 ] ) , we can check the consistency of our results . in",
    "the ( gasb)@xmath25/(insb)@xmath25 sl grown on an average substrate , for example , we obtain @xmath45 2 x 10@xmath46 c / m@xmath47 from eq .",
    "( [ mediamacro ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eqsigma1 ] ) and the electric fields as evaluated by the core level binding energies ( @xmath48 2.6 x 10@xmath28 v / m in the gasb side of the heterojunction and @xmath49 3.3 x 10@xmath28 v / m in the insb side of the heterojunction ) , we find @xmath50 5 x 10@xmath46 c / m@xmath47 .",
    "the agreement between this value and @xmath51 is within our numerical accuracy , which is estimated to be 1.8 @xmath52 10@xmath46 c / m@xmath47 ( considering the error bar on the electric fields ) and shows the consistency of our calculations .",
    "however , if one tries to estimate @xmath53 and @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ ppiezo ] ) and then substitutes the results in eq .",
    "( [ eqsigma2 ] ) , a value for @xmath55 49 x 10@xmath46 c / m@xmath47 ( @xmath55 18 x 10@xmath46 c / m@xmath47 ) is found , using the available calculated @xcite ( experimental @xcite ) elastic , dielectric and piezoelectric constants for each material .",
    "these values seem to be at variance with the integrated value @xmath51 .",
    "the disagreement can be attributed to the use of bulk lattice constants for a region whose thickness is as small as a few monolayers and to the fact that the theoretical and experimental constants @xcite used in eq .",
    "( [ eqsigma2 ] ) are not consistent with the present calculation , since the mte structures considered do not properly take into account internal strain effects .",
    "let us remark that the inconsistency between these values of @xmath5 and the one obtained _ ab - initio _ will not affect the evaluation of the vbo , as will be shown ( see discussion below ) .",
    "furthermore , from the steeper slopes in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with respect to those in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we observe that the magnitudes of the electric fields in the common cation systems are stronger than those in the common anion ones . since eq .",
    "( [ eqsigma1 ] ) leads to a net charge accumulation proportional to the discontinuity of the electric fields , it is reasonable to expect a systematically smaller charge , @xmath5 , in the gasb / insb than in the inas / insb systems , as confirmed by our self - consistent results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mediamacro ] ) .",
    "we recall that the potential line - up can be estimated following the procedure used in xps experiments and widely adopted in all - electron calculations , @xcite which takes core level binding energies as reference levels . according to this method ,",
    "the vbo is obtained as follows : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is an  interface \" term ( which denotes the core level energy difference between atoms in the two bulk regions , _",
    "i.e. _ those denoted by  b@xmath58 \" and  b@xmath59 \" in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and @xmath60 is the so called  bulk \" term and indicates the binding energy difference - with respect to the topmost valence level - between the same core levels in each semiconductor strained as in the heterojunction .",
    "this last term takes into account the effects of strain on the electronic band structure of each bulk material .",
    "we must now note that the evaluation of the @xmath57 term is usually done assuming that the bulk regions of the sl are thick enough so that the atoms taken as reference can be , by all means , considered as  bulk \" atoms .",
    "this procedure implicitly requires that the @xmath57 term must be evaluated in the limit of infinite distances from the interface , where the reference atoms are no longer influenced by the charge rearrangement at the interface .",
    "it is now obvious that this same procedure can not be used for the [ 111 ] oriented heterojunctions .",
    "the presence of electric fields , in fact , makes the @xmath57 term vary with the distance from the interface , so that its evaluation in the limit of  bulk region \" ( _ i.e. _ infinitely far away from the interface ) would result in an ill - defined @xmath57 .",
    "let us observe , by the way , that the same conceptual problem is present for procedures that use the electrostatic potential , rather than core levels , as reference energies for the evaluation of the vbo .",
    "@xcite this problem has been usually overcome @xcite by extrapolating graphically the linear behaviour of the potential ( or the core level binding energy ) in the two bulk regions to an  interface plane \" , @xmath61 , arbitrarily taken half - way along the interface bond , and evaluating the difference between their intercepts .    in the following ,",
    "we illustrate a more rigorous procedure which will also be able to give a reasonable estimate of the related error bar .",
    "let us first discuss how the charge is modified at the interface .",
    "we can split up this charge distribution as the sum of two different effects : ( _ i _ ) a charge accumulation @xmath5 , due to the piezoelectric effect combined with the boundary conditions , which is basically a monopole - like distribution and ( _ ii _ ) a charge depletion and accumulation at the two sides of the heterojunction , which is the usual dipole charge of the interface and is due to the different chemical nature and electronegativity of the constituents .",
    "the charge profile can thus be schematically represented as a symmetric monopole centered on some ideal interface plane @xmath61 plus a dipole which is anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath61 .    according to this scheme and following basic electrostatic arguments",
    ", we can now say that the monopole charge @xmath5 leads to a continuous potential across the interface plane .",
    "the limits for @xmath62 and @xmath63 of this potential must be the same , since the monopole contribution is symmetric with respect to the plane @xmath61 .",
    "on the other hand , the dipole - like charge leads , in these same limits , to a potential discontinuity .",
    "thus , we expect that the valence band offset ( _ i.e. _ the potential discontinuity at the interface ) is only determined by the usual dipole term and is not affected by the presence of the strain induced electric fields .",
    "note that the real total charge density macroscopic average profile ( @xmath40 ) usually has a very complex shape , often changing its sign .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to clearly establish where @xmath61 really is .",
    "however , as a rough approximation , we can calculate the center of gravity of the positive ( @xmath64 ) and negative ( @xmath65 ) charges : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and the integrals are performed between the two bulk regions @xmath43 and @xmath44 as in fig .",
    "( [ mediamacro ] ) .",
    "we may now assume that the interface region is confined between the two extremes @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we are now able to calculate the @xmath57 term appearing in eq .",
    "( [ vbo ] ) and therefore the vbo . a reasonable estimate for the @xmath57 term",
    "could then be obtained from the intercepts at @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the two straight lines which interpolate the core level energies .",
    "the difference of these two values can be taken as the error bar .",
    "we find , for the systems considered , that the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are , as expected , not symmetric with respect to the half - bond position ( which is , in any case , within the ( @xmath73 ) interval ) , due to two different effects : ( _ i _ ) the strain , which modifies the bond lengths at the interface and ( _ ii ) _ the distribution and sign of the monopole term @xmath5 .",
    "in all the cases considered , @xmath69 and @xmath70 differ by as much as 2 a.u .",
    ", which is to be compared with bond lengths along the @xmath30 direction that are usually of the order of 5 a.u .. this estimate of the charge centers of gravity confines , with some precision , the  interface \" to a quite localized region , which is even smaller than a bond length . within this error , we may also say that the interface charge has a surface - like distribution .",
    "the numerical uncertainty on the @xmath57 term can thus be related to the extrapolation procedure on the two extremes of the interface region , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , leading to a numerical uncertainty of about 0.03 ev .",
    "we may now recall , as already pointed out , that in a [ 111 ] ordered sl , we have two inequivalent interfaces with , in principle , different @xmath57 s . for each of the structures",
    "examined , we find that the @xmath57 values obtained following this procedure at the two inequivalent interfaces differ by as much as 0.02 ev , so that we can consider , as a first approximation , @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , we also obtained equal @xmath57 values for the 3x3 and 4x4 sls ( within 0.02 ev ) , thus confirming the validity of the extrapolation procedure ; this also suggests that bulk conditions between the two interfaces are recovered even in the smaller unit cell and that good convergence for the @xmath57 term is reached , as a function of the cell dimensions . note that the value ( 0.17 ev ) obtained in ref . for",
    "inas / insb [ 111 ] grown on an average substrate is in good agreement with the one derived from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) ( 0.19 ev ) .",
    "the small discrepancy ( about 0.02 ev ) is due to the electric fields which modify the core level binding energies and which were not taken properly into account in ref . .",
    "as a last comment , we would like to come back to the structural choices considered . in order to ascertain the dependence of the vbo on the internal strain ( not considered within mte )",
    ", we calculated the vbo for superlattices having the experimental internal strain displacement : we found a change in the band line - up of less than 0.02 ev ( which is well within our numerical accuracy ) .      in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we report our results for the interface contribution @xmath57 , the bulk contribution @xmath60 and the resulting band offset value @xmath75 .",
    "the superscripts @xmath76 and @xmath77 indicate a semirelativistic and fully relativistic ( _ i.e. _ spin - orbit coupling included with a perturbative approach ) treatment of the valence levels , respectively .",
    "the final results for @xmath75@xmath78 include a correction for quasi - particle effects that were omitted in our self- consistent calculations .",
    "thus , starting from the results of ref . , we can include self - energy corrections ( considered uninfluenced by different strain conditions ) to the dft - lda energy levels by adding the quantities @xmath79 = -0.03 ev and @xmath80 = + 0.08 ev to our calculated values . in order to examine the effects of the ordering direction on these quantities of interest",
    ", we plot our table i results in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] for gasb / insb and inas / insb interfaces , respectively , and also report the calculated values for [ 001 ] systems with equal pseudomorphic growth conditions .",
    "@xcite an inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) shows that , as a function of the substrate lattice parameter , the @xmath57 term is almost constant in the gasb / insb [ 111 ] systems ( as in all the [ 001 ] structures @xcite - see the dashed lines ) , whereas in the inas / insb [ 111 ] systems the range in which @xmath57 varies is slightly larger ( about 0.06 ev ) .",
    "this indicates that the charge rearrangement at the interface is quite unaffected by strain conditions , while it is much more influenced by the growth direction .",
    "in fact , we point out that the @xmath57 absolute value is systematically higher ( by as much as 0.15 ev ) in the [ 111 ] structures than in those oriented along the [ 001 ] axis ; furthermore , we observe that the trend relative to the small variations of the @xmath81 term as a function of the substrate lattice parameter seems to be opposite in the two different orientations of the heterojunctions ; in particular , as the substrate lattice constant is increased , the @xmath57 increases ( decreases ) in the [ 111 ] ( [ 001 ] ) case .",
    "however , the variations of the @xmath57 term are of the same magnitude as the error bar and it is therefore impossible to define a clear @xmath57 trend as a function of strain conditions .",
    "let us now discuss the @xmath60 contribution to the band line - up . as previously noticed in ref .",
    ", the mte predicts different bond lengths ( by as much as 2 @xmath82 ) perpendicular to the interface plane , whether we consider the [ 001 ] or the [ 111 ] ordered heterojunctions .",
    "this structural difference is probably responsible for the different @xmath60 term in sls grown on the same substrate ( and therefore with the same in - plane strain conditions ) but having different crystallographic orientation , [ 001 ] or [ 111 ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) and fig . [ fig5 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "finally , we compare the valence band offsets for the cuau and cupt - like heterojunctions .",
    "the perfectly decreasing trend of the vbo as @xmath12 is increased , already evidenced for the [ 001 ] heterojunctions , is still valid for those oriented along the [ 111 ] axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( c ) and fig . [ fig5 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the opportunity of tuning the band offset as a function of the strain conditions is greater in [ 111 ] than in [ 001 ] heterojunctions ; in fact the range in which @xmath75 varies in going from the smallest to the largest @xmath83 is about 0.8 ev for gasb / insb and 0.9 ev inas / insb [ 111 ] interfaces .",
    "we have presented results obtained from flapw calculations performed for [ 111 ] interfaces , in particular for gasb / insb and inas / insb heterojunctions . in order to examine the effects of the",
