    "the standard ( hot ) big bang ( sbb ) theory is an extremely successful one , and has been around for over 60 years , since gamow originally proposed it [ 1 - 2 ] .",
    "remarkably , for such a simple idea , it provides us with an understanding of many of the basic features of our universe .",
    "all that you require in the cooking pot , are initial conditions of an expanding scale factor , gravity , plus the standard particle physics we are used to , to provide the matter in the universe . however , as mentioned the hot big bang theory can successfully proceed only if the initial conditions are very carefully chosen , and even then it only really works at temperatures low enough , so that the underlying physics can be well understood .",
    "the very early universe is out of bounds , yet there is a hope that accurate observations of the present state of the universe may highlight the types of process occurring during these early stages , providing an insight on the nature of physical laws at energies which it would be inconceivable to explore by other means .",
    "another unresolved issue is the cause of the apparent acceleration of the universe today , as seen through the distribution of distant type ia supernovae .",
    "the physical properties of vacuum phantom energy are rather weird , as they include violation of the dominant - energy condition , @xmath3 ( with the equation of state : @xmath4 [ 3 - 4 ] , @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the homogeneous dark energy pressure and @xmath7 is the energy density ) , naive superluminal sound speed and increasing vacuum - energy density .",
    "the latter property ultimately leads to the emergence of a singularity usually referred to as big rip in a finite time in future where both the scale factor and the vacuum - energy density blow up [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "for instance , it was shown that a cosmological model with a singular big rip at an arbitrary finite time in the future can be also obtained when the scalar field satisfies equivalent phantom - energy conditions in the case that it is equipped with non - canonical kinetic energy [ 4 ] for models restricted by a lagrangian of the form @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is a kinetic term ) [ 5 ] .",
    "it was claimed that , therein [ 5 ] , one can play with the arbitrary values of the prefactor @xmath10 for the scale factor expression in eq . ( 10 ) and those unboundedly small positive values of @xmath11 which satisfy the observational constraint [ 5 ] ( note that in this model @xmath12 ) and the currently observed cosmic acceleration rate [ 8 ] to check that such a set of present observations [ 8 ] is compatible with unboundedly small positive values of @xmath11 ( the assumption is , if a quintessential scalar field @xmath13 with constant equation of state @xmath14 is considered , then phantom energy can be introduced by allowing violation of dominant energy condition , @xmath15 ) . note that , in general k - essence is defined as a scalar field with non - canonical kinetic energy , but usually the models are restricted to the above lagrangian form ( @xmath16 ) [ 9].it was proposed that , from the perfect - fluid analogy , if @xmath9 is small [ 5 ] , we have for the pressure and energy density of a generic @xmath1-essence scalar field @xmath13 [ 9 ] @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath0 being given constants such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the prime means derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the equation - of - state parameter reads @xmath23 we set next the general form of the function @xmath24 when we consider a phantom - energy @xmath1-essence field ; i.e. , when we introduce the following two phantom energy conditions : @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the weak energy condition @xmath27 is presumed to be valid here so that @xmath28 . from the second phantom - energy condition",
    ", we then deduce that @xmath29 ( and @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore the function g(y ) should be an increasing concave function , that is we must also set @xmath31.following [ 5 ] , we then specialize in the case of a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime with line element @xmath32 , in which @xmath2 is the scale factor . in the case of a universe dominated by a @xmath1-essence phantom vacuum energy ,",
    "the einstein field equations are then [ 4 - 5 ] @xmath33 with @xmath34 , the overhead dot meaning time derivative . by combining the two expressions above and using the equation of state he can obtain for the function @xmath24 as given above @xmath35 and then the solutions ( for the spatially flat case ) @xmath36 } } , \\hspace*{12 mm }   0<\\beta<1,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is an arbitrary and positive constant",
    "( this positive @xmath37 solution family does represent an accelerating universe if @xmath2 increases once @xmath11 increases [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the hubble parameter then becomes @xmath38 and we also have @xmath39}.\\ ] ] as it was claimed ( the behavior of @xmath2 , cf .",
    "paper , eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) therein [ 5 ] ) and some remarks were made that of quite greater interest is the choice @xmath40 for which the universe will first expand to reach a big rip singularity at the arbitrary time @xmath41 in the future , to thereafter steadily collapse to zero at infinity ; that is it matches the behaviour expected for current quintessence models with @xmath42 .",
    "the potentially dramatic difference is that whereas in quintessence models the time at which the big rip will occur depends nearly inversely on the absolute value of the state equation parameter , in the present k - essence model the time @xmath37 is a rather arbitrary parameter .",
    "we , however , based on similar derivations ( @xmath43 [ 4 - 5 ] ) could obtain eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) the same as that ( the 2nd .",
    "paper ) in [ 5 ] but different behavior of @xmath2 for @xmath44 region with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( compared to the eq .",

    "we can clearly observe that the curves of @xmath51 ( in @xmath44 region ) are different from that claimed in eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) ( the 2nd .",
    "paper ) in [ 5 ] . under these situations ,",
    "values of @xmath2 ( which are negative , if we define @xmath52 we have @xmath53 for @xmath54 , respectively ; then ( the scale factor ) @xmath55_{b_p=1/3,1,3}}\\ ] ] should be negative for @xmath44 ! ) firstly decrease as ( time ) @xmath11 increases until @xmath56 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is an arbitrary integration constant . to be specific , considering @xmath57 and @xmath47 ( or @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , of which the role of dark energy can be played by physical fields with positive energy and negative pressure which violates the strong energy condition @xmath60",
    ", we thus obtain @xmath61 and there is no doubt that @xmath2 should be negative once @xmath44 .",
    "these cases correspond to the earlier collapsing ones ( but not collapse to zero ) instead of expansion .",
    "the @xmath62 curve ( in @xmath44 region ) , however , resembles that presented before ( cf .",
    "( 2.19 ) in the 2nd .",
    "paper of [ 5 ] ) .",
    "it means , for some cases of @xmath0 , the universe will * not * first expand to reach a big rip singularity at the arbitrary time @xmath41 in the future as it was claimed in [ 5 ] .",
    "cases of @xmath2 being negative ( in @xmath44 region ) should be interpreted in another way ( at lease for cases of @xmath63 where the power : @xmath64 is , al least , an odd integer or the denominator of @xmath64 is an odd integer while the numerator of @xmath64 is normalized to be @xmath65 . ) ! in fact , we can set @xmath66 where @xmath67 are positive integers .",
    "we already demonstrated cases of @xmath68 , and @xmath69 which correspond to @xmath70 or @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) .",
    "to let @xmath64 be a positive odd integer , we can select @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it leads to @xmath75 under this choice , @xmath2 will decrease ( for @xmath44 ) following @xmath76 since @xmath77 is an odd integer ( @xmath78 ) ! for example , with @xmath73 , @xmath79 , we have decreasing @xmath2 for @xmath80 ! on the other hand , once we choose @xmath81 , together with @xmath82 is a positive integer , it then sets @xmath83 and @xmath84 with this , as we have shown above @xmath85 , @xmath2 will decrease for @xmath44 following @xmath86{t - t_*}}.\\ ] ] one another example , for @xmath87 , is @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) or @xmath90 , which leads to @xmath91{t - t_*}}.\\ ] ] to further demonstrate present approach , we present cases of @xmath92 in fig .",
    "2 where the scale factor @xmath2 has no singularity for @xmath93 ( for all times ) or the equation - of - state parameter @xmath94 .",
    "note that the hubbel parameter ( @xmath95 ) reads @xmath96 to make a brief summary , for those cases considered in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , we have earlier collapsing cases ( @xmath2 decreasing once @xmath97 ; a negative divergence ! ) . however , as we have illustrated above , cases which do nt belong to the restriction of eqs .",
    "( 7 ) or ( 9 ) , say , @xmath77 is an even integer ( @xmath82 is still an odd integer ) , e.g. , @xmath98 gives @xmath99 and @xmath100 or @xmath101 , will match the results claimed in [ 5 ] : the universe will first expand to reach a big rip singularity at the arbitrary time @xmath41 !",
