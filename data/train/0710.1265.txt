    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) techniques are powerful tools for calculating properties of light nuclei .",
    "the gfmc method , in combination with the argonne @xmath1 ( av18 ) two - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) and illinois-2 ( il2 ) three - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) potentials , reproduces the ground- and excited - state energies for @xmath4 nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is beginning to be used to calculate reactions , such as nucleon - nucleus scattering  @xcite .",
    "electroweak transitions in @xmath0 nuclei have been calculated using the more approximate vmc technique with av18 and the older urbana - ix ( uix ) 3n potential .",
    "these include @xmath5li elastic and transition form factors and radiative widths  @xcite , electric quadrupole ( @xmath6 ) transition probabilities in @xmath7li for pion inelastic scattering  @xcite , gamow - teller ( gt ) matrix elements in @xmath5he and @xmath7be weak decays  @xcite , and radiative capture reactions producing @xmath5li , @xmath7li , and @xmath7be  @xcite .",
    "the vmc results for electroweak transitions reported in earlier works were in reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "however , the av18+il2 hamiltonian reproduces @xmath8-shell binding energies better than av18+uix , and gfmc wave functions are better approximations to the true eigenstates . hence gfmc calculations with av18+il2 for these electroweak transitions are worth investigating . in this work",
    "we study electromagnetic [ @xmath6 and magnetic dipole ( @xmath9 ) ] transition strengths and nuclear beta - decay [ fermi ( f ) and gt ] rates , with the gfmc technique using the av18+il2 potential for nuclei with @xmath0 .",
    "this is the first off - diagonal matrix element calculation using the nuclear gfmc method .",
    "the gfmc technique of evaluating off - diagonal matrix elements should be applicable in many other nuclear calculations , such as isospin - mixing , and low - energy nuclear reactions .    in this work we consider only the one - body parts of the transition operators .",

    "the @xmath65 is related to the cluster separation energy which is taken from experiment ( the gfmc computed separation energies for av18+il2 are close to the experimental values ) .",
    "the accompanying @xmath58 goes to unity ( more rapidly than in the type  i trial function ) and the @xmath59}_{pp}$ ] are taken from the exact deuteron wave function in the case of @xmath5li , or the vmc triton ( @xmath66he ) trial function in the case of @xmath7li ( @xmath7be ) .",

    "the trial function , eq.([eq : psit ] ) , has the advantage of being efficient to evaluate while including the bulk of the correlation effects .",

    "more accurate evaluations of @xmath96 are possible  @xcite , essentially by measuring the observable at the mid - point of the gfmc propagation . however , such estimates require a propagation twice as long as the mixed estimate and require separate propagations for every expectation value to be evaluated . the nuclear calculations published to date",
    "use the approximation of eq.([eq : pc_gfmc ] ) .    for off - diagonal matrix elements relevant to this work",
    "the mixed estimate is generalized to the following expression @xmath97 where @xmath98 and the index @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) refers to the wave function of the initial ( final ) nuclear state . in our calculation",
    "the operator always acts on the trial wave function .",
    "the first term of eq.([eq : mixed_i ] ) is thus replaced by its conjugate @xmath101 in our real computation .",

    "the propagation of the mixed off - diagonal matrix element was generally carried out for a value of @xmath80 up to 3 mev@xmath110 . in most cases",
    "the transition matrix elements are quite stable with this large value of @xmath80 .    as noted in eq.([eq : gfmc-1 ] ) , the gfmc propagation may be computed using a simplified hamiltonian . in the current work we use @xmath77 = av8@xmath111 + il2@xmath111 where av8@xmath111 is a reprojection of av18 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and the strength of the central repulsive part of il2 is modified in il2@xmath111 so that @xmath112 .",
    "energies are then perturbatively corrected by adding @xmath113 .",
    "however all other expectation values are really for eigenfunctions of @xmath77 ; we have no way of correcting them to expectation values in the eigenfunctions of the desired @xmath78 . because @xmath77 is a good approximation to @xmath78",
    ", this in general should not be a problem . however , fermi matrix elements are different from their trivial values ( @xmath114 ) , only because of charge - independence - breaking components in the wave functions : @xmath115 the av8@xmath111 does not contain the strong charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) component of av18 and has only a z - dependent isoscalar projection of the coulomb potential as proposed by kamuntaviius , et al .",
    "@xcite ; all other electromagnetic terms in av18 are not included .",
    "therefore our calculations may seriously underestimate the correct values of @xmath116 for av18+il2 .",
    "this is suggested by a comparison with correlated hyperspherical harmonics ( chh ) calculations , using the av18+uix hamiltonian , of the f and gt matrix elements for @xmath66h decay  @xcite .",
    "the chh value for the gt matrix element is 2.258 while our result computed using av8@xmath111+uix@xmath111 is 2.260@xmath1170.001 .",

    "evaluation of the transition matrix elements is fairly straightforward .",
    "the vmc or gfmc wave function samples for a given @xmath31 state are constructed with a specific @xmath118 projection .",
    "we find it convenient to use the same @xmath118 for both initial and final states , even if @xmath119 is different .",
    "this makes the @xmath9 operator exactly equivalent to the magnetic moment operator , and also keeps the gt operator particularly simple .",
    "we note that the size of the monte carlo statistical errors can vary significantly depending on the particular @xmath118 substate that is chosen .",
    "below we present more than a dozen electroweak transitions between different states of @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the first two subsections discuss the electromagnetic transitions and the last subsection discusses the weak transitions .",

    "the ncsm values were computed for the av8@xmath121+tm@xmath121 hamiltonian which we expect to have similar transitions to the av8@xmath121+il2@xmath121 hamiltonian used here .",

    "we compared our results to cohen - kurath shell - model and no - core shell - model results where available , and also with the current experimental results . in most of the transitions we considered we found that the gfmc transition widths or log(@xmath124 ) values have been improved from the vmc and are in good agreement with experimental numbers .",
    "this is in general true for most of the @xmath6 and all the gt and f type transitions .",
    "however , for @xmath9 type transitions the gfmc widths we obtained are smaller than the current experimental values .",

    "we note here that the effect of mec on @xmath6 and gt transitions are expected to be smaller , about @xmath125 .",
    "in addition to the good results we obtained in most cases we faced some difficulties , especially treating broad nuclear states using the gfmc method . in these cases scattering boundary conditions should be used ; gfmc has recently been successfully applied to the @xmath126 scattering states  @xcite .",
    "we also had difficulty when the main components of the wave functions did not contribute to the transition , with the result depending on cancellations between small components .",
    "some of the transitions that we explored were also treated by using two different types of trial wave functions .",
    "the extrapolated gfmc values obtained by using either of the wave functions should be the same ; in practice they are within 2% of each other .",
    "this is indeed found in our calculations ; the widths we obtain by using one or the other type of trial wave function are very close .    in future",
    ", we expect to extend this work to larger nuclei in the @xmath127=8 - 10 range and for additional operators such as @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "one difficulty we anticipate is that some transitions of interest , such as the weak decays of @xmath130he , @xmath130li , and @xmath130b , run predominantly from large components of the initial state wave function to small components in the final states .",
    "these small components may not be well - determined by the gfmc calculation so additional constraints may be necessary .",
