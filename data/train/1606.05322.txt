    "h@xmath8 is the simplest molecule and plays in molecular physics the role that the hydrogen atom plays in atomic physics .",
    "the level structure of h@xmath8 can be calculated with exquisite precision and accuracy by ab - initio quantum - chemical methods , either by solving the eigenvalue problem of the two - proton - one - electron system directly using variational methods @xcite and artificial - channel - scattering methods @xcite , or by first making an `` exact '' electronic - structure calculation for clamped nuclei in the realm of the born - oppenheimer approximation , and then calculating adiabatic ( i.e. , electronically diagonal ) , nonadiabatic ( i.e. , electronically off - diagonal ) and relativistic corrections by perturbation - theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections are typically evaluated using the second route @xcite . from such calculations ,",
    "an extraordinarily detailed knowledge of the spectrum of h@xmath8 has resulted .",

    "was reported later @xcite .",
    "several energy intervals between fine - structure @xcite , hyperfine - structure @xcite , rotational @xcite , rovibrational @xcite and rovibronic energy levels @xcite of h@xmath8 have also been measured .",
    "quasibound levels of h@xmath8 above the dissociation limit , often called shape resonances , have also been calculated , but less precisely .",
    "58 such resonances are known to exist from the work of moss @xcite who , however , did not report any data on 19 of them , because they are located too close to the maxima of the centrifugal potential barriers for the calculations to reach the desired accuracy .",
    "the ten lowest of these resonances have been calculated by davis and thorson within the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite .",
    "moss has reported adiabatic corrections for these resonances @xcite but did not evaluate nonadiabatic corrections nor did he report resonance widths .",
    "recently , we have observed two such shape resonances by pfi - zeke photoelectron spectroscopy , corresponding to the ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) quasibound levels @xcite , in spectra in which several of the bound levels of the x@xmath6 and a@xmath6 states located near the dissociation limit of h@xmath8 were also observed .",
    "we also calculated the positions and widths of these resonances and found overall good agreement , except for the width of the ( 17,7 ) resonance , which the calculations predicted to be narrower than found experimentally .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to present new experimental and computational results obtained on a broader range of highly excited levels of h@xmath8 .",
    "shape resonances arising from the nuclear motion in molecules have been discovered before , and correctly interpreted very soon after , the introduction of the quantum theory @xcite , in relation to what herzberg classified in 1931 as special case iii of predissociation @xcite , i.e. , rotational predissociation observed in the spectra of diatomic molecules such as alh . since then , rotational predissociation and the corresponding shape resonances have been observed in a multitude of molecular systems .",
    "their quantitative description requires high - quality potential - energy functions and large progress has been made in the development of reliable computational procedures to determine their positions and widths .",
    "the shape resonances of h@xmath0 represent an early example for which computations could be performed with spectroscopic accuracy @xcite . today",
    ", computer codes such as the program level @xcite are used by experimentalists to calculate resonance widths and positions .    in the case of h@xmath8 discussed in this article , achieving spectroscopic accuracy in the computation of shape resonances",
    "poses several problems .",
    "i ) adiabatic , nonadiabatic , relativistic and radiative corrections are all large enough that they need to be considered in the theoretical treatment .",
    "ii ) to retain the concept of a potential curve and nevertheless include nonadiabatic corrections , which , per definition , mix different electronic states , requires specific measures , such as the introduction of @xmath22-dependent reduced masses for the vibrational and rotational motions of the nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "iii ) protons are light and tunneling resonances can be broad so that lorentzian line shapes may not always be appropriate to describe them .",
    "the approach we followed to calculate the shape resonances was largely inspired by the work of moss @xcite , wolniewicz and coworkers @xcite , and kutzelnigg and coworkers @xcite and consists of ( i ) evaluating all corrections to the born - oppenheimer energy while retaining a single - potential description , and ( ii ) going beyond semi - classical wkb methods to compute resonance parameters . because the positions and widths of the resonances might be sensitive to even small variations of the corrections terms",
    ", we analyze the effects of the different corrections terms separately and use the comparison with the experimental data and earlier calculations to validate the computation procedure .",
    "the validation then enables us to predict the positions and widths of the shape resonances of h@xmath8 not predicted by moss in his otherwise complete investigation @xcite .",
    "the bound and quasibound rovibrational levels of h@xmath8 located near the h@xmath6  +  h(1s ) dissociation limit were studied by pulsed - field - ionization zero - kinetic - energy ( pfi - zeke ) photoelectron spectroscopy . because these states have a large average internuclear separation , they are not directly accessible from the x @xmath23 ground state of h@xmath0 . a resonant three - photon excitation sequence via the b @xmath24 and @xmath25 intermediate states were used to gradually enlarge the internuclear separation , as explained in ref",
    "the same sequence also enabled us to select para or ortho h@xmath0 by carrying out the excitation through rotational levels of the @xmath26 state with even or odd @xmath27 value , respectively .",
    "the vacuum - ultraviolet ( vuv ) radiation with wave number @xmath28 around 109750  @xmath29 used to access the b @xmath30 state from the x @xmath23 ground state was generated by resonance - enhanced sum - frequency mixing in kr using two pulsed nd : yag - pumped dye lasers ( repetition rate 25 hz , pulse duration 5 ns ) .",
    "the wave number @xmath31 of the first dye laser was tripled using two successive @xmath32-barium - borate crystals and the tripled output ( @xmath33 ) was kept fixed at the position of the @xmath34(j=0)\\leftarrow ( 4p)^6 $ ] two - photon resonance of kr ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the wave number of the second dye laser was then adjusted so as to access the desired rovibrational level of the b state .",
    "a third nd : yag - pumped dye laser was used to induce the transition from the selected b state to the @xmath36 state , from which the region near the h@xmath8 dissociation limit was reached with a fourth dye laser , delayed by 10 ns with respect to the other lasers using an optical delay line .",
    "this measure helped reducing the intensity of the transitions to rydberg states of h@xmath0 belonging to series converging on the low - lying vibrational levels of h@xmath8 induced by the fourth laser directly from the b state .",
    "all laser beams intersected a supersonic expansion of h@xmath0 at right angles on the axis of a cylindrically symmetric photoexcitation and electron - extraction region consisting of a set of five parallel and equidistant extraction plates designed for the application of homogeneous electric fields @xcite .",
    "stray magnetic fields were eliminated by a double layer of magnetic schielding and stray electric fields were maintained at a level below 10  mv / cm .",
    "the pulsed solenoid valve used to form the supersonic beam was operated at a stagnation pressure of 2 bar of pure h@xmath0 .",
    "the beam was collimated with a skimmer of 1 mm orifice diameter which separated the source chamber from the photoexcitation chamber .",
    "the background pressure in the photoexcitation region did not exceed 10@xmath37  mbar during operation of the pulsed valve .",
    "the pfi - zeke photoelectron spectra of the highest bound levels and the shape resonances of h@xmath8 were recorded by monitoring the yield of electrons produced by the delayed pulsed field ionization of high - lying rydberg states ( principal quantum number @xmath38 ) - either of h@xmath0 for the bound levels of h@xmath8 or of h for the shape resonances - as a function of the wave number of the fourth dye laser .",
    "this laser had a bandwith of 0.03  @xmath29 and its wave number was calibrated at an accuracy of 0.02  @xmath29 with a wavemeter .",
    "the pulsed field ionization was achieved with an electric - field pulse sequence consisting of ten pulses of increasing strength [ ( 1 ) 50 mv / cm , ( 2 ) 70 mv / cm , ( 3 ) 80 mv / cm , ( 4 ) 90 mv / cm , ( 5 ) 110 mv / cm , ( 6 ) 140 mv / cm , ( 7 ) 200 mv / cm , ( 8) 270 mv / cm , ( 9 ) 680 mv / cm , and ( 10 ) 1.22 v / cm ) ] to selectively detect rydberg states of progressively lower principal quantum numbers . the electron signals produced by each of these pulses were recorded separately so that each laser scan led to the recording of ten pfi - zeke spectra . the spectrum recorded from pulse ( 1 ) turned out to be extremely weak , suffered from undesirable contributions from low - energy electrons , and was therefore not used in the analysis . the best resolution ( full width at half maximum of 0.2  @xmath29 ) was obtained with pulses ( 2)-(5 ) . the spectrum recorded with pulse ( 6 ) had a resolution of 0.25  @xmath29 , and those recorded with pulse ( 7 ) and ( 8) a resolution of 0.35  @xmath29 .",
    "the spectra recorded with pulses ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) had the best signal - to - noise ratio but the lines in these spectra were too broad to be useful for the determination of line widths and line positions .",
    "the relative positions of lines in the photoelectron spectra could be determined at an accuracy of 1 ghz from a statistical analysis of the spectra recorded from the different pulses .",
    "the absolute positions of the ionic levels with respect to the selected @xmath26 intermediate levels were determined with an accuracy of about 2  ghz after correcting for the shifts of the ionization thresholds induced by the pulsed electric fields , as described in reference  @xcite .",
    "recorded near the dissociative - ionization threshold from ( a ) the @xmath39 level and ( b ) the @xmath40 level .",

    "the spectra of para and ortho h@xmath0 also contain five weak lines that result from transitions to the x@xmath47 levels from the b(19,1 ) and b(19,2 ) intermediate states . because the energy difference between the b(@xmath48 ) and the @xmath49 are precisely known @xcite , the spectrum enables the determination of the relative positions of low- and high-@xmath9 levels of the x@xmath6 state ( see table [ tab:1 ] below ) .",

    "the spectra recorded from the @xmath60 and 5 are dominated by the transition to the x@xmath6 ( @xmath20 ) shape resonance .",
    "in addition to these shape resonances , the pfi - zeke photoelectron signal in the continuum displays slow variations with the excitation energy and which depend on the selected @xmath3-state rotational level .",
    "the @xmath61 state is sufficiently strongly bound that the centrifugal - potential contribution of states with @xmath58 does not affect the vibrational wave function ( see fig .",

    "the overall phase shift changes by less than @xmath141 .",
    "davis and thorson @xcite have called such features orbiting resonance , thus distinguishing between orbiting ( resonance above barrier maximum ) and shape ( resonance below barrier maximum ) resonances , which others often consider to be equivalent .",

    "comparison of theory and experiment revealed a broad range of spectral features , including shape resonances , orbiting resonances and features resulting from extremely weakly bound levels , and broad energy- and @xmath10-dependent oscillations of the continuum cross sections .    in future work",

    "<S> the pulsed - field - ionization zero - kinetic - energy photoelectron spectrum of h@xmath0 has been recorded in the vicinity of the dissociative - ionization threshold following three - photon excitation via selected rotational levels of the b @xmath1  ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 @xmath4  ( @xmath5 ) intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra consist of transitions to bound levels of the x@xmath6 @xmath7 state of h@xmath8 with @xmath9 in the range 1419 and @xmath10 in the range 09 , of the a@xmath6 @xmath11 state with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and of shape resonances corresponding to the x@xmath14 and x@xmath15 quasibound levels . </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the level structure of h@xmath8 have been carried out and the influence of adiabatic , nonadiabatic , relativistic and radiative corrections on the positions of these levels , and in the case of the shape resonances also on their widths , has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> different methods of calculating the widths and profiles of the shape resonances have been tested for comparison with the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> slow oscillations of the dissociative - ionization yield have been observed and reflect , in first approximation , the franck - condon factors of the @xmath16 @xmath17 x@xmath6 , a@xmath6 bound - free transitions .    </S>",
