    "explaining the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) , that is the higher early - type galaxy fraction in clusters of galaxies in contrast to the higher late - type galaxy fraction in the fields , remains one of the most important problems in cosmology .",
    "this relation holds also for dwarf galaxies .",
    "gas - poor dwarf galaxies are strongly clustered , while gas - rich dwarf galaxies appear to be the most weakly clustered objects ( binggeli et al .",
    "1987 ; ferguson & sandage 1988 ; binggeli et al . 1990 ,",
    "thuan et al . 1991 ) .",
    "since many clusters of galaxies contain an appreciable amount of hot gas , the intracluster medium ( icm ) , gas will be stripped from galaxies that move through the icm , if the ram pressure exceeds the internal gravitational force .",
    "there are actually many observational evidences for the ram pressure stripping of giant galaxies in clusters of galaxies ( irwin et al .",
    "1987 ; white et al . 1991 ; bhringer et al .",
    "in addition , the physics of ram pressure stripping of giant galaxies has been studied in detail using hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. balsara , livio , & odea 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "since dwarf galaxies have smaller escape velocities , ram pressure stripping is expected to be more efficient than for giant galaxies .",
    "however , no attempts have ever been made to examine the amount of gas that could be stripped from low - mass galaxies with shallow gravitational potential wells during their passage through an icm .",
    "this situation motivated us to consider the ram pressure stripping of the diffuse gas phase of dwarf galaxies by the icm which may be of prime importance to understand the morphology - density relation for dwarf galaxies .",
    "we estimate the critical condition for gas removal by the interaction between an icm and gaseous dwarf galaxies confined by a surrounding cold dark matter ( cdm ) halo .",
    "moreover , we verified that condition using an axial symmetric two - dimensional hydrodynamic code which is based on the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) described by colella & woodward ( 1984 ) .    in  2 , prior to the main subject",
    ", we describe the model of dwarf galaxies which is treated as a one - parameter family defined by the core mass of the cdm halos , using the observed scaling relation ( burkert 1995 ) . in  3 , we give the analytical estimates of the critical conditions for the gas ablation from dwarf galaxies due to ram pressure stripping by the icm . in  4 , we demonstrate the complex interaction between dwarf galaxies and the icm using hydrodynamical simulations and compare the simulation results with the analytical predictions . in  5 , we summarise the results of this paper , and discuss observational and theoretical implications .",
    "the hierarchical clustering model of galaxies has been successful in explaining the clustering pattern of galaxies revealed by redshift surveys . on the other hand ,",
    "the hierarchical model predicts a large number of low - mass galaxies formed at high redshifts beyond that estimated from the observed luminosity function of galaxies ( white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al .",
    "therefore , several mechanisms for suppressing and/or delaying the formation of dwarf galaxies have been proposed in order to remove this serious discrepancy .    using a three - dimensional @xmath0-body / sph simulation code combined with stellar population synthesis , mori et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that an energy feedback via supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars keeps a large fraction of the gas hot and suppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies .",
    "moreover , they pointed out that this energy feedback is a necessary mechanism to reproduce the internal structure and the photometric quantities of the nearby dwarf galaxies ( see also dekel & silk 1986 ; yoshii & arimoto 1987 ; burkert & ruiz - lapuernnte 1997 ; mori , yoshii & nomoto 1999 ) .",
    "babul & rees ( 1992 ) and efstathiou ( 1992 ) argued that the formation epoch of dwarf galaxies is delayed until @xmath1 due to the photoionization of the gas by the ultraviolet background radiation at high redshifts .",
    "the ionizing background at @xmath2 is high enough to keep the gas in dwarf galaxy halos confined and stable , neither able to escape , nor able to collapse ( see also rees 1986 ; ikeuchi 1986 ; katz , weinberg & hernquist 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .    following this scenario",
    ", we assume that a ( proto- ) dwarf galaxy has an already virialized cdm halo and a large amount of extended hot gas heated either due to a first population of supernovae or due to the photoionization by ultraviolet background radiation at the formation epoch of the galaxy clusters .",
    "the formation of the cdm halos through hierarchical clustering predicts that the equilibrium density profile of a cdm halo has a central cusp ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1996 ; fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "however , recent observed rotation curves of nearby dwarf galaxies rule out the singular density profile of dark matter halos ( flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , burkert ( 1995 ) points out that the density profile @xmath3 nicely reproduces the rotation curves of nearby dwarf galaxies and the central density @xmath4 is correlated with the core radius @xmath5 through a simple scaling relation .",
    "in this paper we assume that the density distribution of the cdm halos is represented by burkert s ( 1995 ) profile for a wide range of core masses from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . for the density distribution of the cdm halo in equation ( [ rhod]),the potential",

    "the collision between the gas of the dwarf galaxy and the icm generates a forward shock that propagates through the gas of the dwarf galaxy and a reverse shock that propagates through the icm .",

    "murray et al.(1993 ) estimated the characteristic growth time of kelvin - helmholtz instability for a dense cloud embedded in a low - density background .",
    "they showed that the growth time is comparable to the sound crossing time of the gas cloud if gravity is negligible . on the contrary",
    ", the presence of a gravitational field by the surrounding cdm halo tends to suppress the instability and to stabilize the gas against removal from the dwarf galaxy .",
    "we suppose that the process of the instanteneous ram pressure stripping removes the gas distributed outside a core radius @xmath5 . moreover , a sharp discontinuity of the gas density is established between the icm and the galactic gas having nearly constant density after the shock passage .",
    "the unstable wave number of kelvin - helmholtz instability at the interface for the incompressible fluid is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean gas density inside @xmath5 and @xmath59 is the gravitational acceleration at the fluid interface ( cf .",

    "massive dwarf galaxies lose the extended gas within @xmath68 for @xmath69 @xmath30 and @xmath70 km s@xmath32 .",
    "consequently , we expect that even for the massive dwarf galaxy the extended gas will be stripped through kelvin - helmholtz instability within a short time - scale .    on the other hand , balsara , livio , & odea ( 1994 ) demonstrated that the gas accretes from downstream into the core in their hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between the icm and the giant galaxy . since the dwarf galaxies have shallower potential wells than the giant galaxies , we neglect the effect of the gas accretion form backward into the galaxy .",
    "it may play however a role for the massive dwarf galaxies where our estimation of the gas ablation might not be suitable .",
    "in addition to the effect of the accretion inflow into the core from downstream , the above analytic arguments neglect the geometrical effects between the gas in dwarf galaxies and the icm and the presence of the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "moreover , the compressibility of the gas may become important because the each galaxy moves in the cluster of galaxies with the transonic velocity that is corresponding to the velocity dispersion of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "therefore , a realistic analysis that uses a hydrodynamic simulation is necessary to examine the effect of the gas removal due to the interaction between a dwarf galaxy and an icm . in this section",
    ", we describe the numerical model of ram pressure stripping from dwarf galaxies .      for modeling the interaction between a galaxy and an icm , portnoy , pistinner & shaviv ( 1993 ) showed that a treatment of the protons and the electrons as two fluids resulted in negligible differences for the mass of the gas inside the galaxy . in this paper , therefore , the evolution of the gas is described by the hydrodynamic equations for the single perfect fluid .",
    "the continuity equation , the momentum equation , and the thermal energy equation are given by @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gas density , s the gas velocity , @xmath75 is the gas pressure , @xmath76 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath54 is the total specific energy @xmath77 initial conditions are generated using the descriptions in  2 .",
    "we neglect the effects of the self - gravity of the gas , radiative cooling , the heating by supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars , and the photoionization by ultraviolet radiation background .",
    "we discuss them in  5 .",
    "the equations are solved by a finite difference code vh-1 .",
    "vh-1 is based on the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) described by colella & woodward ( 1984 ) and was written and tested by the numerical astrophysics group at the virginia institute for theoretical astrophysics . since the ppm scheme has a great advantage due to the reduction of numerical viscosity , all fluid interfaces are sharply preserved and small - scale features can be resolved .",
    "this scheme is , therefore , suited for this class of problems .",
    "the system is assumed to be axial symmetric and described by cylindrical geometry .",
    "the center of the fixed gravitational potential given by equation ( [ pot ] ) is located on the symmetric axis and the gas distribution of the dwarf galaxy is set up using equation ( [ rhog ] ) .",
    "the reflecting boundary condition is adopted at the bottom boundary that corresponds to the symmetric axis and the icm flows continuously from the left stream boundary parallel to the axis .",
    "the outflow boundary conditions , by imposing for each variable a zero gradient ( @xmath78 ) , are adopted at the top and the right stream boundaries .",
    "unfortunately , this condition does not eliminate reflection waves from the boundaries .",
    "thus , the simulation box is separated by two parts such as the inner rectangle @xmath79 long and @xmath80 wide and an outer surrounding part to keep the boundaries far away .",
    "the grids are equally spaced with 100 zones per core radius for the higher resolution runs or 50 zones for the lower resolution runs in the inner part , and are exponentially spaced in the outer part .",
    "a useful additional effect of this non - uniform grid is the increased numerical dissipation of disturbances that propagate to a large distance .",
    "this helps solving the problem of residual reflection waves from the boundary .",
    "we have performed a parameter study varying the core mass @xmath14 of the cdm halo from @xmath6 to @xmath81 , varying the relative velocity of the dwarf galaxy @xmath82 from 500 km s@xmath32 to 1000 km s@xmath32 , and varying the number density @xmath83 of the icm from @xmath84 @xmath30 to @xmath85 @xmath30 .",
    "table 1 displays the model parameters of the icm in this paper .",
    "figure 2 shows snapshots of the run for the model ( @xmath49 ) of @xmath86 , @xmath87 @xmath30 , and @xmath70 km s@xmath32 as a function of elapsed time at @xmath88 , and @xmath89 yr . the left and the right colour images show the logarithmic density distribution and the logarithmic pressure distribution , respectively .",
    "arrows in the right panels indicate the velocity vector of the gas flow at each point and their lengths are proportional to the absolute values of their velocity .",
    "the cdm halo is located at the origin and the icm flows in from the left side .",
    "the upper panel shows the early phase of the interaction between the icm and the gas of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "it is clearly seen that the forward shock that propagates through the gas of dwarf galaxy , and the reverse shock that propagates through the icm are formed in the downstream and the upstream of the contact discontinuity respectively .",
    "the propagation of the forward shock causes the strong compression of the gas in the dwarf galaxy as seen in the upper and the second panel . below the second panel , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities",
    "are observed at the contact discontinuity .",
    "since the instabilities are suppressed by the gravity , the growing modes are only the disturbances of the large wave numbers that have the shortest growth time .",
    "disturbances with small wave numbers grow while moving away from the galaxy .",
    "the third panel shows that the gas associated with the dwarf galaxy is accelerated by the ram pressure of the icm and is pushed out of the potential well .",
    "since the front of the accelerated gas is highly rayleigh - taylor unstable , there are many small irregularities in front of the contact discontinuity .",
    "accurately , the feature seen on the symmetric axis ( @xmath90 ) at @xmath91 is caused by pure rayleigh - taylor instability . the combination of rayleigh - taylor instability and kelvin - helmholtz instability forms other irregularities because the gas flows tangentially to the fluid interface as seen in the third and right panel . however , the perturbations do not grow significantly because the gravity of the cdm halo suppresses rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the gas removal time - scale nicely agrees with the analytical estimate in equation ( [ tauss ] ) which predicts @xmath92 yr .",
    "figure 3 shows snapshots of the run for the model ( @xmath49 ) of @xmath93 , @xmath87 @xmath30 , and @xmath70 km s@xmath32 as a function of elapsed time at @xmath94 , and @xmath95 yr .",
    "the early evolution of the interaction between the gas and the icm is almost the same as in the case of @xmath96 .",
    "however , since the gravitational potential is deep and the central thermal pressure is larger than the ram pressure of the icm as shown in the analytical model , the mass - loss process is not instantaneous but mild ablation due to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities occur .",
    "moreover , the gas interface is rayleigh - taylor stable because the gas acceleration is week .",
    "the velocity field in the right bottom panel reveals that the flow turns back and an accretion inflow into the core develops close to the symmetry axis on the downstream side .",
    "accretion occurs quasi - periodically as a radial - pumping mode .",
    "the condition of the flow is summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "this flow from the downstream side and the post - shock gas from the upstream side cause increased compression mainly along the symmetry axis .",
    "2 .   the gas in the galaxy ,",
    "therefore , acts by expanding sideways as seen in the third panel . since this expansion increases the cross section of the interaction between the galactic gas and the icm , the mass - loss rate increases .",
    "the expansion decreases the pressure gradient around the galaxy center and the gas contracts to the galaxy center by the gravitational force .",
    "then the system recovers the quasi - static states again .",
    "this cycle repeats again .",
    "this process is effective in the simulations of a massive dwarf galaxy or of a small ram pressure of the icm .",
    "for this specific process , the analytic condition given by  3.2 fails to describe the gas ablation from the dwarf galaxy .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of the gas mass inside the core radius around the center of the dark matter halo as a function of time for core masses of the cdm halo from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "each curve is categorized by the model parameters ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the gas is instantaneously stripped in low - mass dwarfs or for large ram pressures . due to the accretion inflow into the galactic core from the down stream , the net mass - loss rate becomes small .",
    "moreover , we can observe oscillations of the total mass inside a core radius due to the mass accretion .",
    "these oscillation modes have periods of several dynamical timescales .",
    "even for the massive dwarf galaxy ( @xmath99 ) , the gas could be instantaneously stripped if the ram pressure is large as e.g. in the cores of galactic clusters .",
    "figure 5 summarizes the results of our simulations .",
    "this diagram shows the mass - loss rate due to ram pressure stripping as a sequence of the core mass .",
    "filled circles indicate the cases where the gas in the core radius is completely stripped within 1 gyr . in these cases the ram pressure stripping by the icm is very effective and the whole gas in the potential well is rapidly removed .",
    "open circles indicate the cases where the gas in the core radius is not completely stripped within 2 gyr . in these cases ,",
    "the ram pressure stripping by the icm is not so effective .",
    "the thin line indicates the relation of @xmath100 which is the instantaneous stripping condition described in  3.1 .",

    "stripping by kelvin - helmholtz instability is effective for the upper region and is not effective for the lower region . since there is mass accretion from the back of the galaxy ,",

    "this figure shows that the gas in dwarf galaxies is completely stripped in rich clusters of galaxies within the short time - scale .",
    "the effect of radiative cooling has been neglected in our simulations .",
    "we estimate the role of radiative cooling in our models here .",
    "since for low - mass dwarf galaxies ( @xmath40 ) , the ram pressure already exceeds the gravitational force , radiative processes will not be able to affect the gas stripping .",
    "however , it might play a role for massive dwarf galaxies ( @xmath41 ) which have deeper potential wells .",

    "this implies that gas stripping from the massive dwarf galaxies is affected by the radiative cooling .",
    "however , we would then also need to consider the effects of the star formation and subsequent feedback process such as stellar winds and supernovae heating from massive stars .",
    "these feedback processes supply thermal energy to the gas and prevent efficient cooling ( dekel & silk 1986 ; mori et al .",
    "1997 ; mori et al .",
    "in addition , the photoionization due to the ultraviolet background radiation prevents gas cooling and keeps the gas hot ( efstathiou 1992 ; babul & rees 1992 ) . furthermore",
    ", though we studied only the interaction between the icm and a hot interstellar medium in this paper , it is very interesting to examine also the fate of the cool and dense interstellar medium in a dwarf galaxy . in this case",

    "we conclude that the ram pressure stripping of the diffuse gas from dwarf galaxies by the icm is of prime importance to understand the morphology - density relation for dwarf galaxies and the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "most of the heavy elements ejected by massive stars through type ii supernovae are found in the warm and hot diffuse gas . in order for these heavy elements to be incorporated into stars , the hot gas has to cool and form cold clouds again .",
    "our models indicate that this will be impossible for dwarf galaxies in clusters of galaxies , as the gas is stripped before condensing into clouds .",
    "ram pressure stripping therefore plays a significant role for the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "our results imply that most of the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies must have occured at high redshift , before the virialized cluster had formed .",
