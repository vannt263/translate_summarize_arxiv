    "<S> the peak instantaneous index response scales linearly with the laser intensity until the point of ionization , whereupon the response turns abruptly negative and @xmath1constant , consistent with plasma generation .    the optical kerr effect , the intensity - dependent refractive index experienced by an optical pulse in a transparent medium , plays an important role in phenomena from nonlinear propagation in optical fibers @xcite to mode - locking in pulsed lasers @xcite to filamentary propagation in condensed media and the atmosphere @xcite . a recent transient birefringence measurement in the components of air reported by loriot et al </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite purported to show that the optical kerr effect saturates and then becomes negative for intensities greater than 26 tw/@xmath2 . a strong higher - order kerr effect , with a crossover from positive to negative nonlinear index at intensities well below the ionization threshold , would have a huge impact on the nonlinear optics of transparent media , and has inspired theoretical works predicting plasma - free light filamentation @xcite and exotic new effects in light propagation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would overturn the picture most have of the mechanism behind long - range filamentary propagation of intense ultrashort pulses  as arising from an interplay between self - focusing due to the positive optical nonlinearity from bound electrons and defocusing due to the plasma generated by ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a higher - order kerr effect would also have implications for the general nonlinear susceptibility in transparent media @xcite , including harmonic generation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequent experimental studies of light filaments @xcite have not supported the higher - order kerr model , with one exception @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one measurement @xcite found that the electron density was two orders of magnitude higher than predicted by a calculation including higher - order nonlinearities , but agreed with a simulation based on plasma defocusing alone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a physical mechanism for the saturation and negative response was proposed based on the nonlinear response near the threshold of ionization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what is missing from this debate is a direct measurement of the nonlinearity that corroborates or refutes the intensity dependence observed by loriot _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. here , we describe such a measurement in ar and n@xmath0 using spectral interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we find no saturation and no negative instantaneous nonlinear phase , in contrast to the original experiment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the technique we use , single - shot supercontinuum spectral interferometry @xcite , provides a single - shot measurement of the transverse space- and time - dependent phase shift of a chirped probe pulse due to a transient nonlinearity induced by a short pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the time resolution is given by the probe bandwidth ( in this experiment @xmath115 fs ) and the transverse spatial resolution here is 3 @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> loriot _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> used a non - spatially resolved multi - shot technique limited in time resolution by the probe duration of @xmath190 fs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they measured the transient birefringence and inferred the higher - order kerr coefficients from the tensorial symmetry of the nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we can measure parallel and perpendicular components of the nonlinear response independently . </S>",
    "<S> previously , supercontinuum spectral interferometry was used with 110 fs pump pulses to study the nonlinear response of air consituents @xcite , and no sign reversal of the nonlinear index was observed up to intensities where ionization occurs . </S>",
    "<S> however , the use of a gas cell complicates the interpretation of the experiment when the response is highly nonlinear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , at the high pressures used ( @xmath6 atm ) plasma - induced refraction limits the peak intensity . here </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the nonlinear response of ar and n@xmath0 using a 38 fs pump pulse and a 2 mm thick gas target .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ expt ] shows the experimental setup and data . </S>",
    "<S> detailed descriptions of the experimental technique have been given previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the laser is a 1 khz repetition rate ti : sapphire amplifier producing 38 fs full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , 3.5 mj pulses centered at 800 nm . </S>",
    "<S> roughly 700 @xmath3j of the laser output is used to generate supercontinuum covering 640 - 720 nm in a gas cell ( not shown ) filled with 1 - 2 atm of ar ; the fundamental is rejected using a dichroic mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the supercontinuum is linearly polarized . </S>",
    "<S> probe and reference pulses , separated by 1.4 ps , are generated using a michelson interferometer and chirped so that the group delay dispersion is 1950 fs@xmath7 , and then the beam is spatially filtered with a 100 @xmath3 m pinhole . </S>",
    "<S> the pump power is attenuated using a waveplate and thin film polarizers so that the pulse energy is continuously adjustable from 5 - 100 @xmath3j . </S>",
    "<S> the pump beam is then expanded with a telescope , and a @xmath8 waveplate allows rotation of the pump polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the pump and supercontinuum are combined using a dichroic mirror ; at this point the pump beam is about 5 times wider than the probe / reference beam so that the probe spot overfills the pump spot in the interaction region .    a well - defined interaction length , ideally comparable to or shorter than the rayleigh range of the pump beam , minimizes spatial and temporal distortions due to axial variation in the pump intensity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to achieve this , we use a thin gas target inside a vacuum chamber , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]a . </S>",
    "<S> the beams are focused using a lens of focal length 40 cm , and enter the vacuum chamber through a 5 mm thick fused silica window , propagating 30 cm through vacuum to the target . </S>",
    "<S> the pump beam waist , measured by imaging the focus onto a ccd camera , is 22 @xmath3 m fwhm . </S>",
    "<S> the target is a copper gas flow tube with a flattened section through which a 120 @xmath3 m diameter hole was laser drilled to allow the pump and probe to pass through . </S>",
    "<S> the space between the inner tube walls is 1 mm , with a wall thickness of 0.5 mm . </S>",
    "<S> a roots pump keeps the background pressure of the chamber at 400 mtorr , and the local gas density drops quickly enough away from the tube that the probe phase shift is dominated by the gas between the holes . </S>",
    "<S> the pump beam is rejected at the exit of the vacuum chamber using a dichroic mirror that is also used as a window . in the data shown here , </S>",
    "<S> we have subtracted a very small background signal due to cross phase modulation in the entrance window .    </S>",
    "<S> the central plane of the gas tube is imaged onto the entrance slit of an imaging spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> interference fringes appear in the spectrum because of the time delay between the probe and reference pulses . </S>",
    "<S> an example spectral interferogram for ar at 60 tw/@xmath2 pump vacuum intensity is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]b . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity values given here are calculated from the average power and the measured beam profile  we estimate an uncertainty of 20% . the pump pulse , centered at time @xmath9 and transverse dimension @xmath10 , causes a phase shift in the probe pulse @xmath11 ( too small to produce fringe shifts visible by eye in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this causes a change in the spectral phase and amplitude of the probe beam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral phase is found by fourier analysis of the interference fringes , and the change in amplitude is also found from the interferogram . </S>",
    "<S> the final piece of information required is the spectral phase of the reference pulse , which is , to an excellent approximation , quadratic and proportional to the group delay dispersion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted time domain phase shift @xmath11 of the probe is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]c . </S>",
    "<S> the signal - to - noise ratio is considerably improved by summing multiple interferograms before performing the phase extraction @xcite ; in all of the data presented here , 300 interferograms were summed at each power and polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> the bound electron optical nonlinearity in ar is instantaneous to a very good approximation because the energy of the lowest electronic excitation is 15 ev , far greater than the photon energy 1.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the ordinary instantaneous kerr effect is linear in the intensity @xmath12 : the refractive index is of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the index of refraction and @xmath15 is the kerr coefficient , and thus @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured fwhm in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]c of 38 fs matches an autocorrelation measurement of the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial profile lineout , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]d , agrees well with the pump spot profile . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the intensity profile in the thin gas target is the same as the vacuum profile . </S>",
    "<S> the deleterious effect of excessive interaction length on the width of the response is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]d . </S>",
    "<S> a lineout of the measured phase shift along @xmath17 at @xmath9 is shown with the chamber backfilled with ar  note the wider profile compared to the flow tube case . </S>",
    "<S> also shown are simulations of @xmath18 using the beam propagation method @xcite ; with the simulation we obtain an effective pump - gas interaction length of @xmath12 mm , in agreement with the tube geometry . because of the short interaction length , intensity clamping @xcite does not affect the intensity profiles .    the peak phase shift measured in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> is plotted as a function of peak intensity in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]e . </S>",
    "<S> we find a very linear dependence for both ar and n@xmath0 , and nearly the same kerr coefficient , which is consistent with other experiments @xcite . for peak intensity </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 tw/@xmath2 , we measure a peak phase shift in ar of 0.059 radians . for a medium with an effective interaction length @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( note the extra factor of 2 because we measure cross phase modulation ) . using the literature value for ar , @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2/w @xcite at 1 atm , and using @xmath23 mm , we estimate an average pressure in the interaction region of 0.3 atm . </S>",
    "<S> a higher - order kerr effect would add terms of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no negative instantaneous phase is observed at any intensity in ar or n@xmath0 , nor do we see evidence of saturation @xcite , in disagreement with the results of loriot _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation of the phase shift expected using the coefficients reported in @xcite is shown as a dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt]e . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is stark and well outside any error in our experiment we can conceive of . </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed the same experiment in ar using a probe pulse whose spectrum overlaps the pump pulse , with orthogonal polarization so that the pump light could be rejected by a polarizer before the spectrometer ( see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the possible origin of the results obtained in @xcite and have found that the interference of pump and probe pulses of the same wavelength can produce a plasma grating which gives rise to an effective birefringence @xcite .    increasing the pump intensity beyond the level of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expt ] requires careful consideration of increased supercontinuum generation by the pump itself . because the pump and probe paths are not phase stable with respect to one another , spectral fringes between the pump supercontinuum and the reference pulse average out when many interferograms are summed . </S>",
    "<S> so the pump supercontinuum does not cause significant data distortion until it saturates the ccd camera , which occurs at intensities higher than 200 tw/@xmath2 , well beyond the ionization threshold of @xmath1100 tw/@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> maps showing @xmath26 at high intensity in ar are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ argon ] . at high intensities </S>",
    "<S> we observe an additional response due to the plasma generated by ionization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma produces a negative index contribution @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron density and @xmath29 is the critical density . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma densities measured are consistent with calculations using ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> plots of @xmath30 as a function of pump intensity are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ argon]c ( @xmath31 ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ argon]d ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the plasma contribution seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ argon ] is highly characteristic : ( 1 ) its onset at higher intensity ( 180 tw/@xmath2 compared to 120 tw/@xmath2 ) increasingly dominates the instantaneous kerr response at the back of the pulse ; the residual positive kerr peak appears to move forward in time , ( 2 ) unlike the kerr response , the plasma - induced phase shift is probe polarization independent , and ( 3 ) after generation , the plasma response is long - lived on the time scale of this measurement , owing to recombination timescales of order @xmath1100 ps .    in n@xmath0 , the optical kerr response has an additional contribution from the transient alignment of the molecules in the strong optical field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> results for n@xmath0 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nitrogen ] ; @xmath26 is shown at low pump intensity for parallel and perpendicular polarization in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nitrogen]ab . </S>",
    "<S> the index change is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a response function that depends on properties of the rotational levels and the nuclear spin statistics @xcite . in n@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the rotational response peaks about 80 fs after the pump pulse arrives , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nitrogen]a . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the instantaneous kerr effect for parallel to perpendicular polarization is 3:1 in an isotropic medium . for the rotational component , the ratio is @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the different symmetry properties allow the clean separation of the two contributions , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nitrogen]c . </S>",
    "<S> previous measurements using this technique @xcite were unable to resolve the two contributions , but here we can owing to the shorter pump pulse . to our knowledge , this is the first direct observation of the relative contributions of the instantaneous and rotational components of the kerr effect in n@xmath0 . at higher intensities plasma is observed , as shown in plots of @xmath30 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nitrogen]de .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed direct measurements of the optical kerr effect in ar and n@xmath0 using single - shot supercontinuum spectral interferometry . in n@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to distinguish between instantaneous and rotational components of the nonlinearity , and the polarization dependence is consistent with theory . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the usual optical kerr effect , linear in the intensity , as well as the onset of plasma , but no higher - order instantaneous nonlinearities effecting either saturation or negative response . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the pump - induced response appears to be linear in the intensity until the point of ionization is a reflection of the latter s extremely nonlinear onset . at least for 38 fs pulses , there is no practical distinction between plasma and special atomic states with negative polarizability . </S>",
    "<S> finally , these results disprove the idea that higher - order instantaneous nonlinearities are important in nonlinear optics in gases at high intensities . </S>",
    "<S> our results strongly confirm the long - standing conceptual picture @xcite that short pulse filamentation in gases arises from the interplay between nonlinear self - focusing from bound electron nonlinearities and defocusing due to plasma generation .    </S>",
