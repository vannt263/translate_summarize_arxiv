    "unconventional superconductors with spontaneously broken time - reversal - symmetry ( trs ) recently attracted significant interest  @xcite .",
    "the idea of a superconducting pairing violating additional symmetries of the normal phase ( on top of the gauge symmetry ) is intriguing , and there has been a lot of effort to find materials exhibiting such pairings .",
    "considerable evidence indicates that @xmath1 is an unconventional superconductor with broken trs  @xcite .",
    "the most convincing indication is the recent observation of the polar kerr effect ( pke ) in the superconducting state of @xmath1 by xia _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite . in this experiment , a linearly polarized light , incident along the @xmath2 direction perpendicular to the conducting planes of @xmath1 , experiences normal reflection @xcite .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the polarization plane of the reflected light is rotated relative to the polarization plane of the incident light by the kerr angle @xmath3 nrad .",
    "the effect appears below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 k. the kerr rotation , which may be clockwise or counterclockwise , develops in the absence of an external magnetic field and is a clear signature of the spontaneous trs breaking in the superconducting state .",
    "the experiment @xcite used the sagnac interferometer , where two counterpropagating laser beams retrace their paths , so that all effects , other than the trs breaking in the sample , cancel out exactly .",
    "although previous muon - spin - relaxation measurements @xcite gave an indirect evidence that the trs is broken in @xmath1 , the pke experiment @xcite provides much stronger evidence for this remarkable effect .",
    "additional indication for the trs breaking in @xmath1 comes from the josephson junction experiment in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , which was interpreted as the evidence for existence of domains with opposite chiralities . on the other hand",
    ", the scanning squid and hall probe experiments  @xcite , designed to search for domains with opposite chiralities at the surface of @xmath1 , did not find any evidence for the trs breaking .",
    "these results show that macroscopic manifestations of the microscopic trs breaking are not fully understood and require further theoretical investigation . in this paper , we study the electromagnetic properties of a chiral superconductor with the @xmath0 pairing in the clean limit .",
    "@xmath1 is a layered perovskite material consisting of weakly coupled two - dimensional ( 2d ) metallic sheets parallel to the @xmath5 plane @xcite .",
    "it was proposed theoretically that the superconducting pairing in this material is spin - triplet @xcite and has the chiral @xmath0 or @xmath6 symmetry @xcite . in this state",
    ", cooper pairs have the orbital angular momentum @xmath7 or @xmath8 normal to the layers .",
    "such an order parameter breaks the trs and is analogous to the 2d superfluid @xmath9he - a @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the questions of the spin symmetry ( singlet vs triplet ) and the orbital symmetry ( chiral vs nonchiral ) are separate issues .",
    "it is possible to construct chiral order parameters for both triplet and singlet pairing @xcite .",
    "there is substantial experimental evidence in favor of the spin - triplet and odd orbital symmetry of pairing in @xmath1 @xcite , which includes measurements of the spin susceptibility @xcite and the josephson effect @xcite .",
    "however , there are also alternative interpretations @xcite in terms of singlet pairing .",
    "we study the electromagnetic response of quasi-2d ( q2d ) chiral superconductors , and our results are applicable ( with minor modifications ) for either spin symmetry .",
    "we do not pay special attention to the existence of nodal lines in the order parameter of @xmath1 ( see , e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite for an interpretation of tunneling measurements ) .",
    "the nodal lines do not affect the chiral response qualitatively , so we concentrate on the simplest case of the @xmath0 pairing .",
    "although the @xmath0 superconducting pairing breaks the trs and , in principle , permits a non - zero kerr angle @xmath10 , an explicit theoretical calculation of @xmath10 is challenging .",
    "a textbook formula @xcite expresses @xmath10 in terms of the ac hall conductivity @xmath11 at the optical frequency @xmath12 .",
    "a calculation of the intrinsic @xmath11 for a chiral superconductor in the absence of an external magnetic field turns out to be quite nontrivial .",
    "it is customary for theoretical calculations to use the gauge where the scalar potential @xmath13 is set to zero and only the vector potential @xmath14 is considered . in this gauge , the calculations @xcite show that there are no chiral terms in the single - particle response of a @xmath0 superconductor . using this gauge and taking into account particle - hole asymmetry , ref .",
    "@xcite found a small chiral response from the collective flapping modes .",
    "however , when calculations are performed in a general gauge , they do produce a non - trivial chern - simons - type  ( cs ) term in the effective action of a q2d @xmath0 superconductor , which breaks the trs : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron charge and the speed of light , respectively .",

    "@xcite that this term in eq .",
    "( [ j_xy ] ) becomes ineffective at high frequencies and may be neglected .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ j_xy ] ) reduces to the conventional hall relation , and the coefficient @xmath20 can be identified with the hall conductivity @xmath61 and used for a calculation of the kerr angle @xmath10 @xcite .    however , within the two - fluid model of superconductivity , one can argue that newton s equation of motion for the supercurrent is @xmath62 , i.e. ,  the supercurrent is accelerated by the electric force . then , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ j_xy ] ) vanishes , and the chiral hall current @xmath63 is zero  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this cancellation is that the superconducting phase @xmath16 has its own dynamics and compensates the electromagnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ j_xy ] ) @xcite .",
    "in general , eq .",
    "( [ j_xy ] ) should be supplemented with an equation of motion for @xmath16 , and then @xmath16 should be eliminated , so that the current response is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic field only . in other words , one should derive the effective action @xmath64 for a @xmath0 superconductor as a function of the electromagnetic field @xmath65 and the superconducting phase @xmath16 , and then integrate out @xmath16 and obtain a new action @xmath66 in terms of the electromagnetic field only .",
    "this procedure is well established for nonchiral superconductors @xcite , and it was implemented for chiral superfluids in refs.@xcite . however , the calculations in refs.@xcite were performed only in the limit of low frequencies . as a result",
    ", some terms in the effective action were neglected , and the frequency dependence of the coefficients in the action was not considered . in our paper , we perform a detailed derivation of the effective action by taking into account dynamics of @xmath16 and the internal coulomb potential . our results are applicable for all frequencies and exhibit non - trivial frequency dependence .",
    "our calculations show that the effective hall conductivity depends not only on frequency , but also on the wave vector and is proportional to the square of the wave vector @xmath67 parallel to the layers : @xmath68 .",
