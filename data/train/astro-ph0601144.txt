    "mass outflow from a luminous disk is a clue to the formation mechanism of astrophysical jets and winds in the active objects . in particular , in a supercritical accretion disk , the mass - accretion rate highly exceeds the critical rate , the disk local luminosity exceeds the eddington one , and mass loss from a disk surface driven by radiation pressure would take place ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 for a review of accretion disks ) .",
    "so far , radiatively driven outflow from a luminous disk has been extensively studied by many researchers ( bisnovatyi - kogan , blinnikov 1977 ; katz 1980 ; icke 1980 ; melia , knigl 1989 ; misra , melia 1993 ; tajima , fukue 1996 , 1998 ; watarai , fukue 1999 ; hirai , fukue 2001 ; fukue et al .",
    "2001 ; orihara , fukue 2003 ) , as on - axis jets ( icke 1989 ; sikora et al . 1996",
    "; renaud , henri 1998 ; luo , protheroe 1999 ; fukue 2005a ) , as outflows confined by a gaseous torus ( lynden - bell 1978 ; davidson , mccray 1980 ; sikora , wilson 1981 ; fukue 1982 ) , or as jets confined by the outer flow or corona ( sol et al . 1989 ; marcowith et al . 1995 ; fukue 1999 ) , and by numerical simulations ( eggum et al .",
    "1985 , 1988 ) .",
    "line - driven outflows were also extensively examined ( drew , verbunt 1985 ; vitello , shlosman 1988 ; proga et al .",
    "1998 ; murray , chiang 1995 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ; proga , kallman 2004 ) . in almost all of these studies , however , the luminous disk was treated as an external radiation source , and the radiation transfer in the flow was not solved .",
    "radiation transfer in the disk , on the other hand , was investigated in relation to the structure of a static disk atmosphere and the spectral energy density from the disk surface ( e.g. , meyer , meyer - hofmeister 1982 ; cannizzo , wheeler 1984 ; shaviv , wehrse 1986 ; adam et al .",

    "; hui et al . 2005 ; see also mineshige , wood 1990 ) . in these studies , however , the vertical movement and the mass loss were not considered .",
    "recently , mass outflow as well as radiation transfer have been examined for the first time in the subrelativistic and fully relativistic cases ( fukue 2005b , c ) . in these studies ,",
    "the gravity of the central object and the gas pressure were both ignored as a first step . in this paper , we thus consider the radiatively driven vertical outflow  _ moving photosphere _  in a luminous flat disk within the framework of radiation transfer in the subrelativistic regime of @xmath0 , while taking into account the gravity of the central object , although the gas pressure is ignored .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic equations in the vertical direction . in section 3",
    "we show our numerical examination of the radiative flow . in section 4",
    "we briefly apply the present model to the case of a supercritial accretion disk .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a luminous flat disk , inside of which gravitational or nuclear energy is released via viscous heating or other processes .",
    "the radiation energy is transported in the vertical direction , and the disk gas , itself , also moves in the vertical direction due to the action of radiation pressure . for simplicity , in the present paper",
    ", the radiation field is considered to be sufficiently intense that the gas pressure can be ignored ( cf .",

    ", we consider the subrelativistic regime , where terms of the first order of @xmath2 are retained , in order to take into account radiation drag . under these assumptions , the radiation hydrodynamic equations for steady",
    "vertical ( @xmath3 ) flows without rotation are described as follows ( hsieh , spiegel 1976 ; kato et al .",
    "1998 for the full set of basic equations ) .",
    "the continuity equation is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gas density , @xmath1 the vertical velocity , and @xmath6 the mass - loss rate per unit area .",

    "kato et al . 1998 ) , and heating is balanced with the cooling , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the internal heating and @xmath21 is the emissivity .",
    "the last term in the parentheses is the work done by the radiation field under the present approximation .    under the assumption of steady one - dimensional flow , and under the present approximation , the radiation field equations ( kato et al .",
    "1998 ) become @xmath22 , \\label{f1}\\ ] ] @xmath23 , \\label{p1}\\ ] ] and the closure relation becomes @xmath24    eliminating @xmath21 and @xmath16 with the help of equations ( [ j1 ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) , and introducing the optical depth by @xmath25 we can rearrange the basic equations up to the order of @xmath0 as @xmath26    in this paper we assume that the heating @xmath20 is proportional to the gas density @xmath5 for simplicity ( cf .",
    "fukue 2005b ) , and set the following relation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a parameter that determines the magnitude of heating , and therefore the magnitude of the radiation field .",
    "we solved equations ( [ v])([p ] ) for appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "as for the boundary conditions , we imposed the following cases . at the flow base ( disk `` inside '' ) with radius @xmath11 and an arbitrary optical depth @xmath29 , the flow velocity is zero ( @xmath30 ) , the height is zero ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "the radiative flux is zero ( @xmath32 ) , and the radiation pressure is @xmath33 , where subscript 0 denotes the values at the flow base . at the flow top ( disk `` surface '' ) , where the optical depth is zero , the radiation fields should approximately have the values above the luminous infinite disk , and therefore satisfy the condition @xmath34 , where subscript s denotes the values at the flow top ( fukue 2005b ) .",
    "hence , the parameters are @xmath11 , @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath33 at the flow base , and the mass - loss rate @xmath6 is determined as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at the flow top .    in numerical calculations ,",
    "we start from the asymptotic solutions near to @xmath29 : @xmath35 and solve equations ( [ v])([p ] ) down to the optical depth to @xmath36 .",
    "we then obtain the final values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 at the flow top .",
    "generally , the final values do not satisfy the boundary condition of @xmath34 .",
    "we thus iterate the value of @xmath6 so as to satisfy the boundary condition . technically , in some cases , we iterate @xmath33 instead of @xmath6 .    finally , we normalize the physical quantities in terms of the speed of light @xmath41 , the schwarzschild radius @xmath12 , and the eddington luminosity @xmath42 [ @xmath43 , since we consider the luminous disk around a black hole",
    ". that is , the normalized quantities are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48",
    ". moreover , the basic equations ( [ v])([p ] ) are expressed as @xmath49 where the symbol `` hat '' ( say , @xmath50 ) is dropped .",
    "in this section we show the radiative vertical flow in the luminous disk under the influence of the gravity of the central object . in order to obtain the solution , as already stated",
    ", we numerically solve equations ( [ v_nor])([p_nor ] ) , starting from asymptotic solutions near to @xmath51 with appropriate initial conditions , down to @xmath36 so as to satisfy appropriate boundary conditions there .",
    "the parameters are the initial radius @xmath11 on the disk , the initial optical depth @xmath29 , which relates to the disk surface density , the heating rate coefficient @xmath28 , which roughly expresses the radiative flux at the flow top and is the measure of the strength of radiation field to gravity , and the initial radiation pressure @xmath33 at the disk base , which connects with the radiation pressure gradient in the vertical direction and relates to the disk internal structure .",
    "the mass - loss rate @xmath6 is determined as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at the flow top .",
    "several examples of numerical calculations are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",

    "the quantities are normalized in units of @xmath41 , @xmath12 , and @xmath54 .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , the mass - loss rate increases as the initial radiation pressure increases , while the flow final speed increases as the initial radiation pressure and the loaded mass decrease .",
    "these properties are similar to those in a previous study without gravity ( fukue 2005b ) .",
    "in particular , when the disk luminosity is high ( figure 1b ) , the results are quite similar to the previous case without gravity . in the case where the disk luminosity is low ( figure 1a ) , on the other hand , the final velocity becomes small , as easily expected .",
    "furthermore , if the disk luminosity is sufficiently small , the radiative flow becomes impossible due to the effect of gravity .",
    "in addition , as can be seen in figure 1 , in order for the flow to exist , the radiation pressure @xmath33 at the flow base is restricted in some range similar to the previous case .",
    "that is , in the previous study without gravity ( fukue 2005b ) , the initial pressure @xmath33 is proved to be restricted in the range of @xmath55 in the case where heating is included . in the present case , when the disk luminosity ( characterized by @xmath28 ) is high ( figure 1b ) , @xmath33 is restricted in the similar range .",
    "when the disk luminosity is low ( figure 1a ) , on the other hand , the values of @xmath33 become small , but is yet restricted in some range . at the upper limit of these ranges , the loaded mass diverges and both the flow final speed and flow height become zero . on the other hand , at the lower limit , the loaded mass becomes zero and the flow final speed becomes the maximum .    in figure 2",
    "we show the flow velocity @xmath1 ( solid curves ) , the flow height @xmath3 ( chain - dotted ones ) , the radiative flux @xmath17 ( dashed ones ) , and the radiation pressure @xmath18 ( dotted ones ) , as a function of the optical depth @xmath56 for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and several values of @xmath33 in a few cases of @xmath28 .",
    "the quantities are normalized in units of @xmath41 , @xmath12 , and @xmath54 .    when the initial radiation pressure @xmath33 at the flow base is large , the pressure gradient between the flow base and the flow top is also large . as a result ,",
    "the loaded mass @xmath6 also becomes large , but the flow speed @xmath1 is small . when the initial radiation pressure @xmath33 is small , on the other hand , the pressure gradient becomes small , and the loaded mass also is small , but the flow speed becomes large . when the disk luminosity ( characterized by @xmath28 ) is large ( figure 2b ) , the flow velocity as well as the radiation fields become large . when the disk luminosity is small ( figure 2a ) , on the other hand , the flow velocity and the radiation fields are small .    in the limit of small @xmath28 ( see figure 2a ) ,",
    "the radiation fields approach the non - relativistic case of @xmath57 .",
    "in such a case , equations ( [ f_nor ] ) and ( [ p_nor ] ) are analytically integrated to give @xmath58 where @xmath59 in this limit . in this limit ,",
    "the relation derived in the previous study ( fukue 2005b ) again holds : @xmath60 hence , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the temperature at the flow base ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 the effective temperature at the flow top ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is just the modified milne approximation .",
    "in this section we apply the present model to the mass outflow in the luminous supercritical accretion disks .",
    "when the mass - accretion rate @xmath66 in the disk around a central object of mass @xmath8 highly exceeds the critical rate @xmath67 , defined by @xmath68 , the disk is believed to be in the supercritial regime , and the disk luminosity exceeds the eddington one .",
    "such a supercritical accretion disk , a so - called slim disk , has been extensively studied , both numerically and analytically ( abramowicz et al .",

    "2002 ; fukue 2004 ) . except for the case of fukue ( 2004 ) , however , many of these analytical models as well as numerical ones did not consider the mass outflow from the disk surface . hence , in this paper we adopt the model developted by fukue ( 2004 ) , as a background supercritical disk model .    in the _ critical accretion disk _ constructed by fukue ( 2004 )",
    ", the mass - accretion rate is assumed to be regulated just at the critical rate with the help of wind mass - loss .",
    "outside some critical radius , the disk is in a radiation - pressure dominated standard state , while inside the critical radius the disk is in a critical state , where the excess mass is expelled by wind and the accretion rate is kept to be just at the critical rate at any radius . here",
    ", the critical radius is derived as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the accretion rate at the outer edge of the disk , and @xmath71 . outside",
    "@xmath72 , the accretion rate is constant , while , inside @xmath72 the accretion rate would vary as @xmath73    in such a critical accretion disk , the disk thickness @xmath74 is conical as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is some numerical coefficient determined by the similar procedure in narayan and yi ( 1994 ) for optically - thin advection - dominated disks .",
    "the second equality of this relation comes from the numerical calculation ( watarai et al .",
    "although the mass loss was not considered in watarai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we adopted this relation as some measure : when the normalized accretion rate @xmath77 is 100 , the coefficient @xmath78 becomes 0.448 .",
    "furthermore , in fukue ( 2004 ) , several alternatives are discussed , and some of them gives the physical quantities of the critical accretion disk with mass loss as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the viscous parameter .",

    ", we can solve the basic equations , and obtain numerical solutions at each radius @xmath11 .",
    "the example in the case of @xmath84 and @xmath85 is shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure03.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure04.eps    in figure 3 we show several quantities for each radius @xmath11 : the disk height @xmath74 ( dashed curve ) and the optical depth @xmath29 ( chain - dotted one ) are from the critical accretion disk model , while the height @xmath38 and velocity @xmath37 ( solid curves ) at the flow top are the results of numerical calculations .",
    "the quantities are normalized in units of @xmath41 and @xmath12 .    as can be seen in figure 3",
    ", the flow height @xmath38 , where the optical depth is zero , is about @xmath86 of the disk scale height @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , the final speed @xmath37 at the flow top is quite small in this example ; @xmath87 .",
    "it is noted , however , this speed is _ not _ the final wind speed from the disk , but the initial _ starting _ speed of the mass loss from the disk surface . with this starting speed ,",
    "mass loss from the disk surface takes place , and is further accelerated in an optically thin regime by the intense disk radiation fields .",
    "it should be noted that the final speed @xmath37 gradually increases with decreasing @xmath11 since the flux @xmath39 increases with decreasing @xmath11 . in the innermost region , however , it decreases due to the relativistic gravity of the pseudo - newtonian potential .    in figure 4",
    "we show the flow velocity @xmath1 ( solid curves ) and optical depth @xmath56 ( dashed ones ) , as a function of height @xmath3 for several values of @xmath11 .",

    "the flow resembles the case without gravity . for less - luminous cases , however , the flow velocity decreases , and flow",
    "would be impossible due to the existence of gravity .",
    "the radiative flow investigaed in the present paper must be a quite _ fundamental problem _ for accretion - disk physics and astrophysical jet formation , although the present paper is only the second step ( cf .",
    "fukue 2005b ) , and there are many simplifications at the present stage .    for example , we have ignored the gas pressure . in general cases , where the gas pressure is considered",
    ", there usually appears sonic points ( e.g. , fukue 2002 ) , and the flow is accelerated from subsonic to supersonic . in this paper",
    "we consider a purely vertical flow , and the cross section of the flow is constant . if the cross section of the flow increases along the flow , the flow properties such as a transonic nature would be influenced .",
    "fully relativistic effects are also important . in such a fully relativistic case , where the flow speed is of the order of the speed of light ,",
    "the boundary condition at the flow top should be carefully treated ( cf .",
