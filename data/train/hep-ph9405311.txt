    "in this appendix we wish to explain a method for calculating ( connected ) expectation values of a string of plaquette operators in the background of our trial action @xmath3 ( eq .  ( [ eq - trial_links ] ) ) .",
    "the method involves expressing the expectation values of products of single link operators in terms of tensor projection operators @xcite , which can then be multiplied together within an algebraic manipulation package .",
    "of those available , we found form the most suitable because it has an explicit summation convention and extensive substitution facilities .",
    "let us start with the simplest example , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a single - link element of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath111 , and by taking the trace we establish the coefficient as @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq - vdefs ] ) ) :      the notation has been chosen with a view to subsequent examples and in general refers to the young tableau associated with a particular permutation symmetry , in this case trivial , of the upper indices .        if we now go on to the product of three @xmath110 s , there are three irreducible representations of the relevant permutation group @xmath117 . however , since we are constructing irreducible tensors of @xmath0 , the completely antisymmetric operator @xmath118 effectively vanishes and only the completely symmetric and mixed symmetry operators @xmath119 and @xmath120 survive .",
    "the form of these tensors can be deduced from the group algebra of the conjugacy classes of @xmath117 , which comprise @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the non - trivial products in the algebra are @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath118 for @xmath0 corresponds to the equivalence relation @xmath127 when acting on the identity element @xmath128 .",
    "thus in our search for projection operators we can limit ourselves to the sub - algebra of @xmath129 generated by the even permutations of @xmath121 , @xmath8 .",
    "it is then easy to construct the required projection operators as @xmath130 acting on @xmath128 by permutation of the upper indices . by taking traces we can establish the coefficients as @xmath131 , @xmath40 in the expansion @xmath132    for the product of four @xmath110 s , we can anticipate that @xmath133 the problem is to establish the specific form of the three projection operators . again",
    "the procedure is to look at the group algebra of @xmath134 , which has five conjugacy classes .",
    "because of the equivalence relations arising from the vanishing in @xmath0 of completely antisymmetric combinations involving more than two indices , we can eliminate the classes of odd permutations and work with the group algebra of the alternating group @xmath135 .",
    "this has three classes , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath136 , with algebra @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . from these it is possible to construct the projection operators @xmath140",
    "these formulae are sufficient to evaluate all the diagrams we encountered up to @xmath78 .",
    "diagrams involving @xmath141 can be dealt with @xcite by converting @xmath141 to @xmath110 according to @xmath142 in particular , @xmath143 a given diagram will consist of a number of plaquettes with certain links in common .",
    "the procedure is then to write down the general expression for the corresponding amplitude , identify the shared links , apply the appropriate substitutions for @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 and then sum over all repeated indices .",
    "in fact we actually want the connected expectation values ( cumulants ) @xmath148 .",
    "these can be obtained by identifying the different terms in the expansion of @xmath149 with products of expectation values of the corresponding partitions of the @xmath7 plaquettes .",

    "<S> the functions @xmath42 are defined as ratios of modified bessel functions of argument @xmath43 :    @xmath44    two derived quantities which appear frequently in the contributions of higher order diagrams are @xmath45 as defined above : @xmath46 and @xmath47    the higher order diagrams consist of modifications to this basic diagram by inserting additional plaquettes at either end and/or in the middle . at order </S>",

    "<S> that is , their connected expectation can be obtained from the basic building blocks shown in fig .  2 , with additional factors representing the bulk of the ladder .    </S>",
    "<S> diagrams which involve a modification at one end have a multiplicity which is independent of the total temporal separation @xmath38 , whereas the three diagrams 1(f ) , 1(h ) and 1(k ) which involve an addition to the middle of the ladder have @xmath38-dependent multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> the latter essentially exponentiate in higher orders and so are the only ones which contribute to the mass gap when this is calculated from the @xmath1-expansion of the ratio @xmath49 ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - tayrat ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of these diagrams are given below : @xmath50    the diagrams of order @xmath51 are similarly built up by adding a further plaquette in all possible ways . </S>",
    "<S> some examples are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . there are around 150 diagrams at this order , although again it is only those with @xmath38-dependent multiplicities which contribute to the @xmath1-expansion of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> there are also additional terms in @xmath52 and @xmath53 which arise from the expansion of the factor @xmath54 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq - parfn ] </S>",
    "<S> . the most succinct way of including such contributions is to note that @xmath2 always occurs in the combination @xmath55 ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - action ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the @xmath45 s occurring in the various expectation values are really functions of this argument , which needs to be taylor expanded to the appropriate order . </S>",
    "<S> altogether we may write @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the multiplicity of the @xmath58th diagram and @xmath59 is its connected expectation value .      having set up the diagrams necessary to calculate the correlation @xmath27 , we now need to extract the mass gap @xmath60 using the familiar result : @xmath61 as @xmath62 , giving @xmath63    at first sight it might seem reasonable to calculate @xmath27 and @xmath64 separately , applying the pms to each correlation , and then to extract @xmath65 from equation ( [ eq - mgdef2 ] ) . however , this is not a fruitful procedure for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that it is not in the spirit of the pms , according to which it is the final quantity calculated which should be optimized with respect to @xmath2 . more importantly , the convergence of the expansion performed in this manner is extremely slow . </S>",
    "<S> it is , after all , asking a great deal of a perturbation expansion , even when optimized , to give the correct @xmath66 limit of @xmath27 with only a few terms of the expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important aspect of the problem is that some of the diagrams have multiplicities which grow with @xmath38 , reflecting the fact that additional plaquettes can be attached in a large number of positions to the body of the ladder . </S>",
    "<S> thus the larger the value of @xmath38 , the higher the order of the perturbation expansion required before the factorial denominators in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - parfn ] ) eventually control the convergence </S>",
    "<S> . however , these diagrams essentially exponentiate . </S>",
    "<S> for example the series of `` bracket '' diagrams starting with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(h ) and continuing with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(h ) has the form of an exponential series for large @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , when the series for the _ ratio _ is taken the @xmath38-dependence cancels , as we show in more detail below . </S>",
    "<S> thus by considering the taylor expansion for the ratio , the limit @xmath66 does not pose such a threat to the convergence of the series . </S>",
    "<S> a similar procedure was adopted by mnster @xcite in the application of the strong coupling expansion to the calculation of the mass gap .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore apply the pms to the taylor expansion of the ratio @xmath67 , up to third order in @xmath1 . writing the series for @xmath27 and @xmath64 as @xmath68 the ratio has the expansion @xmath69    </S>",
    "<S> this formulation leads to a nave large @xmath38 limit for the mass gap . in going from temporal separation @xmath38 to @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> , we add an extra plaquette to the ladder part of each diagram , which gives an overall extra factor @xmath71 to the correlation . thus one might expect the mass gap to be equal to @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for the lowest - order contribution we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 , so that indeed @xmath75 . in higher orders , however , @xmath38-dependent multiplicities give rise to corrections to the nave result .    </S>",
    "<S> the next - order coefficients have the form : @xmath76 then to second order in @xmath1 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - tayrat ] ) is : @xmath77\\ ] ] again this is independent of @xmath38 , and means that in this form of the expansion @xmath38 does not need to be taken asymptotically large . </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to take it large enough for the diagrams to settle down to a generic form .    </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath78 , writing @xmath79 the @xmath20 term in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> as emphasized by mnster @xcite , the summation over the spatial positions of the upper plaquette @xmath29 , which also serves to project out zero spatial momentum in the correlator , is vital to this exponentiation .    altogether </S>",
    "<S> , then , we have the @xmath38-independent result for the ratio to order @xmath83 : @xmath84.\\ ] ]    this expression for @xmath49 is still a function of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the pms criterion , we are looking for stationary points in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> typical curves of the @xmath2 dependence are shown in figs .  4 and 5 for @xmath85 and @xmath78 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath85 there is a single maximum , and at @xmath78 the value of @xmath49 at the maximum is remarkably close to this , even though the position in @xmath2 is quite different .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> our result is expressed in terms of the inverse of the lattice spacing @xmath86 , which we need to take to zero in order to make contact with the continuum limit . </S>",
