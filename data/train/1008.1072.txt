    "non - thermal x - ray emission has been detected from a steadily growing number of supernova remnants ( snrs ) located in the galaxy .",
    "thanks to significant advances in the angular resolution capabilities of modern x - ray observatories , important progress has been made in localizing the origin of this particular type of emission .",
    "such localization has revealed that this emission is not associated with any neutron stars observed in projection toward these snrs ( which may or may not be physically associated with the snrs themselves ) : also , this localization is essential for identifying the radiation mechanism responsible for this emission . in the case of six",
    "snrs  namely sn 1006 @xcite , g1.9@xmath30.3 @xcite , g28.6@xmath00.1 @xcite , g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite , g330.2@xmath31.0 @xcite and g347.3@xmath00.5 @xcite  the detected x - ray emission is predominately non - thermal . for a subset of these snrs ( sn 1006 , g1.9@xmath30.3 , g266.2@xmath01.2 , g330.2@xmath31.0 and g347.3@xmath00.5 )",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission is localized to narrow filaments of emission located on the leading edge of the snr .",
    "other galactic snrs  such as cas a , kepler , tycho and rcw 86  feature significant amounts of non - thermal x - ray emission in addition to the typical thermal x - ray emission detected from snrs @xcite . in the cases of these particular snrs ,",
    "non - thermal x - ray emitting filaments are observed surrounding regions of thermal - dominated x - ray emission .",
    "in fact , in the case of cas a ( and likely also to be the case for other snrs as well ) , filaments of non - thermal emission are also detected toward the central regions of the snr : such filaments may be physically located on the edge of the snr but seen toward the center due to projection effects or they may actually be located in the interior of the snr .",
    "we note that cas a also exhibits evidence for an unresolved component to its non - thermal x - ray emission : evidence for the existence of this component includes measurements of the total flux from the sum of these filaments ( including both filaments located along the edge of cas a as well as filaments seen toward the interior ) can only account for one - third of the non - thermal x - ray emission detected from the snr by other x - ray observatories . complementary _",
    "xmm - newton _ images of cas a at higher x - ray energies ( corresponding to approximately 10 kev ) suggest that this unresolved component may be associated with the reverse shock or contact discontinuity ( in other words , a region located inside the snr ) .",
    "in fact , in an analysis of _ suzaku _ observations of cas a , @xcite found that the peak of hard x - ray emission ( for energies between 11 and 14 kev ) possibly coincides with the location of an observed peak of tev emission from the snr : those authors suggest that this finding indicates that both high - energy hadrons as well as leptons can be accelerated in the reverse shock in an snr , since the tev peak should have a hadronic origin ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in the cases of those snrs which feature x - ray spectra dominated by non - thermal x - ray emission ,",
    "a diffuse component of x - ray emission of this type is usually not detected .",
    "based on data from pointed observations made with the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( @xmath4 ) as well as data from the @xmath4 galactic plane survey @xcite , @xcite identified three new galactic candidate x - ray snrs ( g11.0@xmath30.0 , g25.5@xmath30.0 and g26.6@xmath00.1 ) which may also belong to this class and @xcite identified yet another possible member , g32.4@xmath30.1 .",
    "@xcite also estimated that approximately 20 galactic snrs with x - ray spectra dominated by non - thermal emission may be luminous enough to have been detected by the @xmath4 galactic plane survey .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that even more snrs of this type will be detected and identified as the sensitivities and imaging capabilities of x - ray observatories continue to improve and more x - ray observations of the galactic plane are conducted .",
    "synchrotron radiation is a commonly accepted mechanism for the origin of the observed non - thermal x - ray emission detected from snrs . in the case of a synchrotron origin , the observed radiation is being produced by highly - relativisitic cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along the expanding shock fronts of these snrs @xcite and localized to the observed filaments .",
    "other processes besides synchrotron radiation  namely inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons and non - thermal bremsstrahlung  have also been proposed to account for the observed non - thermal x - ray emission from snrs , but these two other proposed processes both have difficulties in adequately modeling this emission @xcite . a non - thermal bremsstrahlung origin for the emission has been ruled out because the same electron population responsible for such emission should also excite emission lines in the x - ray spectra which are not observed . in the case of a possible inverse compton scattering origin , the predicted slope of the x - ray spectrum produced by this process is much flatter than the slopes of the detected x - ray spectra .",
    "additional evidence for a synchrotron origin of this observed x - ray emission stems from qualitatively consistent simple modeling of synchrotron emission from snrs over broad ranges of photon energies , namely the radio through the x - ray @xcite .",
    "debate still persists in regards to the diffuse non - thermal x - ray emission detected from cas a : some authors have argued that this emission has a synchrotron origin @xcite while others suggest a non - thermal bremsstrahlung origin @xcite .",
    "we note that morphological comparisons between radio and x - ray images of snrs have also been made as part of studies of x - ray synchrotron emission from these sources .",
    "these comparisons assume that the radio emission from an snr has a synchrotron origin and have concentrated on higher x - ray energies to avoid confusion with thermal emission from the snr at lower x - ray energies .",
    "the results of these morphological comparisons have been mixed .",
    "a robust correspondence between x - ray and radio emission along the northeastern rim of sn 1006 has been noted @xcite as well as a broader overlap between x - ray and radio emission from the northwestern rim of g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite : these results support a synchrotron origin for the non - thermal x - ray emission detected from these snrs .",
    "however , in the case of g1.9@xmath30.3 an anti - correlation between x - ray and radio emission is observed : the northern rim is a strong radio source but weak in x - ray while the eastern and western rims are strong in x - ray but weak in radio @xcite . finally , x - ray and radio emission from the snrs g28.6@xmath00.1 .",
    "g330.2@xmath31.0 and g347.3@xmath00.5 do not appear to be strongly correlated @xcite , but such comparisons are complicated by the fact that each of these snrs are weak radio emitters . in table [ summaryobssnrstable ] , we present a summary of observations that have been made with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory @xcite of the six galactic snrs mentioned previously with x - ray spectra dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "these studies have exploited the high angular resolution ( @xmath2 1@xmath5 ) capabilities of _ chandra _ to image the leading filaments located in the x - ray luminous rims of these snrs .    a synchrotron origin for the observed non - thermal x - ray emission from the rims of these snrs is of considerable interest to the cosmic - ray astrophysics community because such emission is consistent with models of synchrotron radiation from cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along the forward shock of snrs @xcite .",
    "by thoroughly analyzing this observed emission from the rims of snrs , we can address several fundamental issues regarding cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "for example , we can probe the particular distribution of high - energy electrons along acceleration sites and determine if these electrons are gathered in a diffuse plasma , clumped in filaments or have accumulated immediately before the forward shock .",
    "we can also estimate the maximum energy of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along the shock fronts associated with snrs . because cosmic - ray electrons and protons are expected to be accelerated along the shock in a similar manner @xcite , these studies can also help us to improve our understanding of the acceleration of both leptonic and hadronic cosmic - ray particles .",
    "there have been several recent claims that tev emission has been detected from three of the snrs mentioned above , namely sn 1006 @xcite , g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite and g347.3@xmath00.5 @xcite with the cangaroo ( collaboration of australia and nippon ( japan ) for a gamma ray observatory in the outback ) series of telescopes , specifically cangaroo - i and cangaroo - ii @xcite",

    "@xcite , have also detected tev emission from sn 1006 @xcite , g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite and g347.3@xmath00.5 @xcite .",
    "currently , there is no consensus about the physical origin of this tev emission : some authors had argued that this emission is from cosmic microwave background photons which have been upscattered to tev energies via inverse compton scattering interactions with ultrarelativistic cosmic - ray electrons @xcite . in contrast , other authors have instead claimed that this emission is due to neutral - pion decay typically at the site of an interaction between an snr and a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "several authors have assumed the former interpretation and included the emission detected at tev energies from these snrs to model processes related to cosmic - ray acceleration by these sources over extremely broad ranges of energies such as radio through tev @xcite . in @xcite , we studied cosmic - ray electron acceleration by one of the snrs with an x - ray spectrum dominated by non - thermal emission ( g347.3@xmath00.5 ) with a spatially - resolved broadband ( 0.5 - 30.0 kev ) analysis of data from observations made with _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) . in this paper",

    "much of this debate has centered on determining whether g266.2@xmath01.2 is located at a distance comparable to the distance to the vela snr ( estimated to be 250@xmath730 pc ",
    "@xcite ) or if g266.2@xmath01.2 lies at a distance beyond the vela snr .",

    "other studies have cast doubt on the statistical significance of the claimed detections of x - ray and @xmath8-ray emission lines in extracted spectra from the northwestern rim of g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite as well as associations in general between historical supernovae and peaks in nitrate abundances in antarctic ice cores @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated an expansion rate of g266.2@xmath01.2 based on two observations made with _ xmm - newton _ of the northwestern rim of g266.2@xmath01.2 that were separated by 6.5 years .",
    "those authors derived a low expansion rate of 0.023@xmath70.006% for g266.2@xmath01.2 : from this rate they estimated an age of 1.7 - 4.3 @xmath9 10@xmath10 years for the snr and a distance of 750 pc .",

    "the angular resolution of the _ chandra _ mirrors and acis varies over the observed portion of the northwestern rim of g266.2@xmath01.2 from approximately @xmath12 at the aimpoint to @xmath13 for a region that is located approximately @xmath14 off axis .",
    "the maximum on - axis effective area for the mirrors and the acis - s3 ccd is approximately 670  @xmath15 at 1.5 kev : for energies between 0.4 and 7.3 kev ,",

    "the steps taken in producing new evt2 files for both observations are outlined as follows : first , the ciao tool ` destreak ` was used to remove anomalous streak events recorded by the acis - s4 chip .",

    "this evt2 file was then filtered based on grade ( where grades=0,2,3,4,6 were selected ) ,  clean \" status column ( that is , all bits set to zero ) and photon energy ( all photons with energies between 0.3 and 10 kev were selected ) .",
    "good time intervals supplied by the pipeline were also applied : in addition , a light curve for the observation was prepared and examined for the presence of high background flares during the observation using the ciao tool ` chips ` .",
    "no variations were seen at the level of 3@xmath16 or greater : we therefore conclude that background flares do not affect the dataset at a significant level . for the final evt2 files generated for obsids 3846 and 4414 , the effective exposure times weere 39363 seconds and 33917 seconds , respectively , for a total effective exposure time of 73280 seconds .",
    "the two evt2 files were combined to produce a single co - added image with an elevated signal - to - noise ratio using the ciao tool ` dmmerge ` .",

    "we have labeled several salient features of this rim complex , including a thin but prominent leading shock , a leading rim and a trailing rim : these features were noticed by prior studies of this rim complex @xcite and the high angular resolution capabilities of _ chandra _ are essential for a detailed spatially - resolved spectroscopic study of this complex . the x - ray emission from this rim complex",
    "is known to be rather hard . in figures",

    "as noted in section [ introductionsection ] , filaments with hard x - ray spectra have been observed along the leading rims of several galactic snrs , including sn 1006 @xcite , cas a @xcite , kepler @xcite , tycho @xcite , rcw86 @xcite , g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite , g330.2@xmath31.0 @xcite and g347.3@xmath00.5 @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that these filaments originate from non - thermal ( synchrotron ) emission from cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along the snr shock and that the widths of these filaments can help constrain estimates of both the downstream magnetic field and the maximum energy of the synchrotron - emitting electrons @xcite . in table",
    "[ table3 ] we present published estimates of widths for the observed filaments for five of the snrs mentioned above : we have also adopted distance estimates to calculate the corresponding linear widths of the filaments as well .",
    "remarkably , the ranges of values for the filament widths are rather consistent with each other ( though it should be noted that estimates of distances to galactic snrs remain significantly uncertain ) : similar findings were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that a narrow range of widths of the filaments of snrs ( particularly the young snrs considered here ) is dictated by the dynamics of snr evolution .",
    "we note that in contradiction the filament widths seem to be much larger for g347.3@xmath00.5 by nearly an order of magnitude for an assumed distance of 6.3 kpc @xcite , but the contradiction disappears for the much closer distance of 1 kpc claimed by other authors @xcite .",
    "to compare the widths of the observed rims seen in the northwestern rim complex of g266.2@xmath01.2 by our _ chandra _ observation with the widths of the filaments seen in the other snrs , we performed the following fitting procedure .",
    "we note that this work extends the analysis conducted by @xcite of filaments associated with the rim complex by analyzing a total of eight regions ( compared with three presented in that work ) and regions located on the acis - s2 and -s3 chips ( instead of just the acis - s3 chip ) . at several locations along the bright northwestern rim ( see figure  [ figimg ] ) , we characterized the length scales over which the x - ray surface brightness increases from the nominal level outside the snr to the peak value along the rim . at each location , a @xmath32 ( 100  pixel @xmath9 400  pixel )",
    "rectangular extraction box was defined .",
    "this particular box size was chosen to strike a balance between choosing a size small enough to avoid artifically broadening the width because the shock front has some curvature ( that is , it is not entirely linear ) but large enough to contain enough photons for detailed spatial fitting . the rotation angles of the boxes were adjusted until the long axes of the boxes appeared to be perpendicular to the filament : next , the declination coordinates of the centers of the boxes were adjusted until these centers were within one pixel of the locations of the peak surface brightness .",
    "once these criteria were met , the iterative fitting process began : the events in each box were extracted and a one - dimensional histogram along the long axis of the box was created ( e.g.  see fig .  [ fighist ] ) .",
    "each histogram was fit with the function @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total number of events at @xmath35 , @xmath35 is the coordinate along the long direction of the box ( @xmath35 is larger at larger radii ) , @xmath36 is the location of the peak surface brightness , @xmath37 is the length scale over which the surface brightness increases from the nominal level `` outside '' the remnant to the peak value at the rim , @xmath38 is the length scale over which the surface brightness decreases `` inside '' the snr from the peak value at the rim , @xmath39 is the peak number of events and finally @xmath40 is the nominal number of background events .",
    "the five free parameters in the fits include @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "to ensure that the length scales @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not artificially increased by using boxes whose long sides are not perpendicular to the rim , several rotation angles were used .",
    "the rotation angles @xmath41 were varied from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in one degree steps .",
    "the angles @xmath44 represent the best initial guesses at the rotation angles of the boxes . at each rotation angle , the data were re - extracted , histogramed and fitted as described above . at each location on the rim ,",
    "the best - fit rotation angle @xmath45 was obtained by fitting the results of @xmath37 versus @xmath41 with a quadratic function of the form @xmath46 ( e.g.  see figure  [ figangle ] ) .",
    "the angles @xmath45 at which the quadratic functions have minima and the best - fit values for @xmath37 at these angles are listed in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "the boxes are oriented in figure  [ figimg ] at the best - fit angles @xmath45 . as shown in figure  [ figoffaxis ] , there is a correlation between the lengths @xmath37 and the off - axis angles @xmath47 , which correspond to the off - axis angles of the center of the extraction box .",
    "this correlation demonstrates that the point - spread function of the _ chandra _ mirrors contributes significantly to the fitted length scales at least for the locations that are far from the optical axis .",
    "the length scales @xmath37 of regions b and c may be relatively free of the effects of the mirrors . in this case , the actual length scale of the filaments may be about 7  pixels ( about @xmath48 ) .",
    "the best - fit values for @xmath38 and @xmath49 , which are obtained in the same way as the values for @xmath37 and @xmath45 , are not listed in table  [ table4 ] because the length scales @xmath38 are not necessarily the length scales over which the x - ray surface brightness decreases inside the leading shock .",
    "it is very likely that the geometry of the snr may not be as simple as a thin spherical shell , which would make estimates of @xmath38 less physically meaningful .",
    "some of the emission that appears to be `` inside '' the snr in figure  [ figimg ] may be part of the same irregular surface that produces the leading shock .",
    "this emission may appear to be inside the remnant because it is seen in projection .",
    "any emission from an irregular surface that is seen in projection can ( and did ) result in artificially large fitted values for the length scales @xmath38 .",
    "the length scales @xmath37 should be relatively immune to such effects .    in table",
    "[ table5 ] we list our derived length scales @xmath37 ( in both arcseconds and parsecs ) for the eight analyzed filaments and compare these with estimates for length scales of the filaments associated with five historical snrs that were measured and presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note the recent work of @xcite who claim that the widths of these filaments are tied to the rapid decline in the strength of the magnetic field downstream from the turbulence rather than the energy losses of the radiating electrons .      as described in section [ obssection ] , we have extracted spectra from seven regions in the rim complex and in table [ table6 ] we list relevant properties of these regions . with the _ a priori _ knowledge that the x - ray emission from the rim complex is predominately non - thermal , we attempted to fit the extracted spectra using three different non - thermal models , described below . to create background spectra for the purposes of our spectral modeling , we extracted spectra from regions located just ahead of the leading edge of the rim complex on each chip .",
    "this choice of background helps us to account for diffuse thermal emission seen from the vela snr in projection against the rim complex itself @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we have used the photoelectric absorption model phabs @xcite to account for the absorption along the line of sight to the northwestern rim complex .",
    "the regions considered for spectral analysis ( both source regions and the background regions ) are depicted in figure [ g266regionsfig ] .",
    "we note that this work extends previous spectral analysis of this rim complex that was presented by @xcite by considering the properties of regions sampled by the acis - s2 , -s3 and -s4 chips instead of just the acis - s3 chip .",

    "this model has traditionally been used to fit the x - ray spectra extracted from _",

    "the results of our fits to the spectra of the seven regions in the rim complex using this model are given in table [ table7 ] : for each region we give the best fit values for the column density @xmath54@xmath55 , photon index @xmath50 , the normalizations of each fit and for each obsid ( along with 90% confidence ranges for each of these parameters ) , the ratio of the values of the @xmath56@xmath30 to the number of degrees of freedom ( i.e. , the reduced @xmath56@xmath30 value ) and the absorbed and unabsorbed fluxes .",

    "our derived photon indices range from approximately 2.38 through 2.70 ( in broad agreement with the photon index value measured for the whole complex by @xcite ) and differences are seen in the values of the photon index for different regions .",
    "several regions in the rim complex may actually be physically associated based on similar values for the derived photon indices : one pair of plausibly associated regions are regions # 3 and # 7 , both of which feature indices of @xmath50 @xmath2 2.38 ( the lowest values of photon indices for any of the regions in the rim complex ) and appear to form a clearly - defined leading shock .",
    "similarly , regions # 1 and # 4 appear to form a feature , seen in projection which trails behind the leading shock ( though region # 1 is a leading structure in the portion of the rim complex sampled by the acis - s2 chip ) .",
    "finally , regions # 2 and # 6 form a trailing rim that is even more clearly distinct from the leading shock ; we suspect that this rim also appears to lie interior to the leading shock simply because of projection effects . in their analysis of _ xmm - newton _ observations of this snr , @xcite first mentioned the presence of this trailing rim though the superior angular resolution of _ chandra _ more clearly resolves this feature as distinct from the leading shock , as noted by @xcite .",
    "we interpret the slight range of values of the photon index to possibly indicate the presence of variations in the shock conditions of accelerated electrons within the complex : the lower index of the leading rim indicates that cosmic - ray electrons are being accelerated to higher energies than at the sites of the regions with higher indices",
    ". we will continue to discuss variations in the shock conditions in different portions of the rim complex when we describe our spectral fits with the synchrotron models below . for illustrative purposes , in figures [ shockspectrafig ] and [ confconfig ] we present the extracted spectra of one region ( namely region # 3 ) as fit with the phabs@xmath9power law model and confidence contours for this fit , respectively .",
    "the other two models that we used to fit the extracted spectra , srcut and sresc , assume a synchrotron origin for the hard x - ray emission observed from the snr .",
    "both of these models have been described in detail elsewhere but we provide brief descriptions of each one here . the srcut model",

    "the sresc model @xcite describes a synchrotron spectrum from an electron distribution limited by particle escape above a particular energy .",
    "this model describes shock - accelerated electrons in a sedov blast wave which are interacting with a medium with uniform density and a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the sresc model takes into account variations in electron acceleration efficiency with shock obliquity as well as post - shock radiative and adiabatic losses . @xcite and @xcite",
    "have described successfully applying the sresc model to fit extracted x - ray spectra from the bright rims and the interior of sn 1006 using data from observations made by both _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte_. a crucial feature of both the sresc model and the srcut model is that a resulting fit made with either of these models can be compared with two observable properties of an snr , namely its flux density at 1 ghz and radio spectral index @xmath11 .",
    "we note that one of the fit parameters of these two models is the cutoff frequency @xmath17@xmath60 of the synchrotron spectrum of the accelerated cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "this frequency is defined as the frequency at which the flux has dropped from a straight power law by a factor of ten for srcut and by a factor of six for sresc .",
    "we can express @xmath17@xmath60 as ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath61 where @xmath62@xmath63 is the magnetic field strength of the snr in @xmath1 g and it is assumed that the electrons are moving perpendicular to the magnetic field . based on the value for @xmath17@xmath60 returned by the sresc and srcut models as well as its normalization @xmath59 , we can model the synchrotron spectrum of the shock - accelerated cosmic - ray electrons associated with snrs and estimate the maximum energy @xmath51@xmath60 of the shock - accelerated electrons . we emphasize here that to make this estimate of the cutoff energy , either the magnetic field needs to be measured or a specific value for the magnetic field needs to be assumed .    in applying the sresc and srcut models , the observed radio properties of the snr  namely the flux density at 1 ghz and @xmath11 ",
    "are needed to constrain the x - ray spectral fits in a meaningful manner . like many of the other characteristics of g266.2@xmath01.2 that were described in section [ introductionsection ] ,",
    "the radio properties of this snr have proven to be controversial as well . to investigate the radio properties of this snr , @xcite used data from the deep continuum survey of the galactic plane made with the parkes 64 meter telescope at a frequency of 2.4 ghz and with an angular resolution of 10.4 arcmin as conducted and described by @xcite . @xcite",
    "combined this dataset with additional 1.42 ghz data obtained with the 30 meter telescope of the instituto argentino de radioastronomia at villa elisa , argentina : the half - power beamwidth of this instrument at 1.42 ghz is approximately 34 arcminutes .",
    "based on these observations , @xcite claimed to have detected extended limb - brightened features associated with this snr at the frequencies of 2.4 and 1.42 ghz and argued that the radio morphology of this snr closely corresponds to the x - ray morphology .",
    "different conclusions were reached by @xcite , however , who performed their own analysis of the 2.4 ghz radio data and also considered data from new radio observations made at 1.40 ghz and 4.85 ghz with the parkes telescope : the latter data was obtained as part of the parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey @xcite and the angular resolutions of these observations were 14.9 and 5 arcminutes , respectively .",
    "@xcite argued that the extended features described by @xcite are more likely to be associated with the vela snr than with g266.2@xmath01.2 itself . by considering the radio emission detected within a circle corresponding to the x - ray extent of g266.2@xmath01.2 , @xcite measured a spectral index @xmath11 = 0.40@xmath70.15 ( where @xmath18@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath17@xmath25 ) for the northern half of the snr using the method of  t - t \" plots as described by @xcite and argued that this spectral index value was applicable to all of g266.2@xmath01.2 .",
    "they also estimated the integrated fluxes from this snr at the frequencies of 2.42 and 1.40 ghz to be 33@xmath76 and 40@xmath710 jy , respectively . by extrapolating their measured integrated flux to a frequency of 1 ghz using the above spectral index value , @xcite estimated the integrated flux from g266.2@xmath01.2 at that frequency to be 47@xmath712 jy and from this value calculated an average surface brightness of this snr at 1 ghz to be @xmath64@xmath26 to be 6.1@xmath71.5 @xmath9 10@xmath65 w m@xmath66 hz@xmath67 sr@xmath67 = 6.1@xmath71.5 @xmath9 10@xmath68 jy sr@xmath67 .",
    "the broadband radio observations presented by @xcite of g266.2@xmath01.2 more clearly revealed a shell - like radio morphology for this snr : in particular , enhanced radio emission at the northwestern rim complex . using the average surface brightness calculated for this rim complex at 1 ghz ( see section [ atcasubsection ] ) and the measured angular sizes of each region , we calculated the corresponding flux density at 1 ghz for that region .",
    "the calculated flux densities for each region are provided in table [ table6 ] .",
    "we then performed our spectral analysis with the sresc and srcut models using these calculated flux densities for the normalizations .",
    "these frozen normalizations are necessary to help make meaningful interpretations of fits to the x - ray spectra of these features assuming a synchrotron origin to the emission .",
    "certainly , local variations are expected in the corresponding flux density at 1 ghz for each region : newer radio observations made with higher angular resolution are required to clearly identify such variations and measure the corresponding flux densities .    in tables",
    "[ table8 ] and [ table9 ] we present the results of our fits to the extracted spectra using the srcut and the sresc model . for each fit",
    "we have listed the fit parameters including column density @xmath54@xmath55 , spectral index @xmath11 , cutoff frequency @xmath17@xmath60 ( along with 90% confidence intervals for each of these parameters ) , the normalization value used , the ratio of @xmath56@xmath30 to the number of degrees of freedom for each fit and the corresponding absorbed and unabsorbed fluxes of each region .",
    "based on the the fit values for the cutoff frequencies derived from fitting the srcut model to the spectra of the seven regions , we have used equation  [ eeqn ] to calculate the maximum energy @xmath69 of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated at each of these regions .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we have assumed a field strength @xmath70 g , which is expected to be a lower limit on the actual magnetic field strength . in table",
    "[ table10 ] we list our computed estimates for @xmath69 for each region and each assumed normalization : our estimates for @xmath69 for the different regions range from 30 to 40  tev with the highest estimated value corresponding to the portion of the leading shock that corresponds to region  # 7 . the higher observed value for @xmath69 for this region may indicate that cosmic - ray acceleration is the most robust at this location and that cosmic - ray electrons are accelerated to their highest energies in the narrow regions along the shock front .",
    "once again we point out that the _ chandra _ observations have revealed a possible range of spatial variations in the acceleration of cosmic - ray electrons along the entire rim complex .    in tables",
    "[ table11 ] and [ table12 ] we present listings of published estimates for the cutoff frequencies of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated by a sample of snrs in the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , respectively : in each case these estimates have been derived using the srcut model .",
    "most of these estimates have been taken from @xcite and @xcite ( tables  [ table11 ] and [ table12 ] , respectively ) .",
    "we have included in this list several snrs ( like kes  73 , 3c  396 , g11.2@xmath00.3 and rcw  103 ) considered by @xcite which are now known to be associated with central x - ray sources which contribute confusing hard emission that was not spatially resolved from the snr itself by the _ asca _ observations . therefore , these estimates for @xmath69 must be interpreted with caution . in addition , we have augmented the lists from those two papers with published estimates from other papers which have considered other snrs .",
    "using equation  [ eeqn ] and again assuming a magnetic field @xmath70 g , we have calculated a value for @xmath69 for each snr .",
    "lastly , we have added to table  [ table11 ] our own estimate for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for g266.2@xmath01.2 as described in this paper to help generate an up - to - date listing of values for @xmath69 for snrs both in the galaxy and in the lmc .",
    "all of the estimates presented here for values of @xmath69 must be interpreted with a great deal of caution , given known significant uncertainties in our understanding about the true shape of the electron spectrum and about the magnetic field strength . as shown in equation  [ synceqn ] , the model srcut is based on the assumption that the electron spectrum is a power law with an exponential cut off . if the cosmic - ray energy density at the forward shock is large enough , then the shock transition region will be broadened @xcite . as a result ,",
    "cosmic - ray spectra do not have power - law distributions : instead , the spectra flatten with increasing energy @xcite .",
    "evidence of such curvature has been reported for cas  a @xcite , rcw  86 @xcite and sn  1006 @xcite .",
    "if magnetic fields in remnants are @xmath73 g or larger , as has been reported for several young remnants , then the electron spectrum should be steepened due to radiative losses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , theoretical analyses presented by other authors @xcite have used an alternative form for the cutoff ( that is , @xmath74 ) where the range of values for @xmath75 have included 1/4 , 1/2 , 1 or 2 ( though @xcite have argued in favor of the use of @xmath76 ) . taken altogether , it is clear that the simple spectral form of the accelerated electrons in equation  [ synceqn ] ( as featured in such models as srcut and sresc ) is likely to be a significant over - simplification of the true shapes of the spectra .",
    "we comment that the data presently available for g266.2@xmath01.2 may not be sensitive enough for very rigorous models of the shape of the electron spectrum .",
    "because the synchrotron emissivity function for a monoenergetic collection of electrons is quite broad @xcite , the shape of the synchrotron spectrum will be a very broadly smeared version of the shape of the electron spectrum at the energy where the electron spectrum is cutoff .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum can also be broadened if the electron spectrum or magnetic field strength vary within a spectral extraction region .",
    "we also comment that the cutoff frequency is only one of the parameters in the fit that control the shape of the spectrum : our fits also include a photon index and an absorption column density and the values of these shape parameters are correlated .",
    "if the electron spectrum is curved and if radiative losses are important at the cutoff energy in the electron spectrum , then the synchrotron model is clearly over - simplified and should include additional shape parameters . if the electron spectrum is curved due to the pressure of cosmic rays or synchrotron losses or if @xmath77 , then the estimates for the maximum electron energies in tables  [ table11 ] and [ table12 ] are overestimates .",
    "furthermore , the assumed magnetic field strength of @xmath78 g is clearly an underestimate for some young snrs , where the magnetic field is known to be closer to @xmath79 g : in such a case , the estimates for the maximum energies given here are certainly overestimates and the true maximum energies may be lower still .    despite these reasons to expect that the true electron cut - off energies are lower than the values listed in tables  [ table11 ] and [ table12 ] , it is still clear from the augmented tables that no known snr ( either galactic or in the lmc ) appears to be accelerating cosmic - ray electrons to the energy of the knee feature of the cosmic - ray spectrum ( that is , approximately 3000  tev ) , just as pointed out by @xcite in referencing their table  11 . from the work in the present paper",
    ", we have established that g266.2@xmath01.2 does not appear to be accelerating cosmic - ray electrons to the knee feature either : we note that the values listed for @xmath71 in tables  [ table11 ] and [ table12 ] are derived from integrated spectra for these snrs , while we have considered for g266.2@xmath01.2 the region with the highest value for @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , wide variations in the values for this quantity have been reported for spatially - resolved spectral analyses of snrs like sn  1006 @xcite and cas  a @xcite . also , as stated by @xcite",
    ", it must be stressed that these maximum values are most likely overestimates given the assumption that most or all of the x - ray flux from an snr is non - thermal in origin . ignoring the contribution of thermal emission is clearly incorrect for snrs which are known to feature emission lines in their x - ray spectra .",
    "we note that additional analyses published by other authors have provided _ lower _ limits on the maximum energy of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated by snrs .",
    "for example , in analyzing synchrotron emission at infrared wavelengths from cas  a , @xcite concluded that the maximum energy of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated by that snr was at least 0.2  tev .",
    "given the significant losses through synchrotron radiation which are expected from cosmic - ray electrons as they are accelerated to high energies , it is not very surprising that no snr has been observed to be accelerating cosmic - ray electrons to the energy of the knee feature .",
    "the fact that no snr features an @xmath69 value that is near the knee energy is not unexpectedrefle given that the knee feature is more clearly associated with cosmic - ray protons and nucleons .",
    "our analyses place no constraints upon the maximum energy of the nuclei .",
    "the conclusions of this paper may be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) we have conducted an analysis of two x - ray observations made with _",
    "chandra _ of the luminous northwestern rim complex of the galactic snr g266.2@xmath01.2 : the combined effective integration time of the two observations was 73280 seconds .",
    "this snr is a member of the class of galactic snrs which feature x - ray spectra dominated by non - thermal emission , which is commonly interpreted to be synchrotron in origin .",
    "we have performed an x - ray spatially - resolved spectral analysis of this rim complex to help probe the phenomenon of non - thermal x - ray emission from snrs and its relationship to cosmic - ray acceleration by these sources .",
    "these observations have revealed fine structure in the rim complex , including a sharply defined leading shock and additional filaments . to help constrain the analysis of synchrotron emission from this rim complex ,",
    "we have also considered radio observations made of g266.2@xmath01.2 with atca at the frequencies of 1384 mhz and 2496 mhz .",
    "\\2 ) we have modeled the length scales of the upstream x - ray emitting structures located along the northwestern rim complex and sampled by the acis - s2 , -s3 and -s4 chips .",
    "we compared these length scales with published length scales for other non - thermal x - ray - emitting structures associated with the rims of five historical galactic snrs .",
    "the length scales range from 0.02 to 0.08 pc and are comparable to those measured for the older historical snrs .",
    "\\3 ) we have extracted spectra from seven regions that were sampled using the acis - s array ( namely the acis - s2 , acis - s3 and acis - s4 chips ) and fit the spectra using several non - thermal models , namely a simple power - law and the synchrotron models srcut and sresc .",
    "statistically acceptable fits have been derived using each model : however , slight variations are seen in derived fit parameters such as the photon index and cutoff frequency .",
    "we interpret the variations of these parameters to possibly indicate differences in how cosmic - ray electrons are accelerated along different sites of the rim complex .",
    "we argue that the lower photon index and higher cutoff frequencies derived for the two regions that compose the leading shock ( our regions # 3 and # 7 ) are indicative of cosmic - ray electrons being accelerated to the highest energies at these locations .",
    "\\4 ) we estimate the maximum energy of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along this rim complex to be approximately 40 tev .",
    "this maximum energy is associated with region # 7 , a region that forms a portion of the leading shock of the rim complex .",
    "we have also estimated the maximum energies of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated by other galactic snrs and lmc snrs based on published values of cut - off frequencies .",
    "as established in prior works , no known snr appears to be currently accelerating cosmic - ray electrons to the knee energy of the observed cosmic - ray spectrum ( though this knee feature is more applicable for cosmic - ray protons and cosmic - ray nucleons ) .",
    "such a result is not unexpected , given that significant synchrotron losses from accelerated cosmic - ray electrons are predicted to limit the maximum energies of these accelerated particles to energies significantly below the energies associated with the knee feature .",

    "<S> we present a detailed spatially - resolved spectroscopic analysis of two x - ray observations ( with a total integration time of 73280 seconds ) made of the luminous northwestern rim complex of the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) g266.2@xmath01.2 ( rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 ) with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory . </S>",
    "<S> g266.2@xmath01.2 is a member of a class of galactic snrs which feature x - ray spectra dominated by non - thermal emission : in the cases of these snrs , the emission is believed to have a synchrotron origin and studies of the x - ray spectra of these snrs can lend insights into how snrs accelerate cosmic - ray particles . </S>",
    "<S> the _ chandra _ </S>",
    "<S> observations have clearly revealed fine structure in this rim complex ( including a remarkably well - defined leading shock ) and the spectra of these features are dominated by non - thermal emission . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the length scales of the upstream structures at eight positions along the rim and derive lengths of 0.02 - 0.08 pc ( assuming a distance of 750 pc to g266.2@xmath01.2 ) . we have also extracted spectra from seven regions in the rim complex ( as sampled by the acis - s2 , -s3 and -s4 chips ) and fit these spectra with such models as a simple power law as well as the synchrotron models srcut and sresc . we have constrained our fits to the latter two models using estimates for the flux densities of these filaments at 1 ghz as determined from radio observations of this rim complex made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . </S>",
    "<S> statistically - acceptable fits to all seven regions are derived using each model : differences in the fit parameters ( such as photon index and cutoff frequency ) are seen in the different regions , which may indicate variations in shock conditions and the maximum energies of the cosmic - ray electrons accelerated at each region . finally , we estimate the maximum energy of cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along this rim complex to be approximately 40 tev ( corresponding to one of the regions of the leading shock structure assuming a magnetic field strength of 10 @xmath1 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> we include a summary of estimated maximum energies for both galactic snrs as well as snrs located in the large magellanic cloud . like these other snrs </S>",
    "<S> , it does not appear that g266.2@xmath01.2 is currently accelerating electrons to the knee energy ( @xmath23000 tev ) of the cosmic - ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this result is not surprising , as there is some evidence that loss mechanisms which are not important for the accelerated cosmic - ray nucleons at energies just below the knee might cut off electron acceleration . </S>"
