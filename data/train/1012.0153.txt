    "turbulent flows contain eddies with various scales .",
    "turbulent kinetic energy is transferred from eddies with the largest scale of turbulence , @xmath6 , at which energy is injected into the turbulence system , to eddies with the smallest scale of turbulence , @xmath7 , at which energy is dissipated by fluid viscosity .",
    "such cascade processes are usually characterized by the velocity structure functions , @xmath8 , defined as moments of velocity increments over a space separation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes a time average . since the pioneering work of @xcite , various theories and models",
    "have been put forwards to predict the scaling behaviors of the velocity structure functions in the so - called inertial range @xmath11 ( see , for reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from experimental aspects ,",
    "velocity measurements are usually carried out at a single fixed location , based on which time series of fluctuating velocities are obtained and the velocity structure functions , @xmath12 , are calculated as moments of velocity increments over a time separation @xmath13 .",
    "to relate the properties of the experimentally measured @xmath14 in time domain to theoretical predictions of @xmath15 in space domain , one needs to invoke the taylor s frozen - flow hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the validity of such hypothesis demands low turbulent intensity and weak shear rates @xcite . however , these conditions are not always met by actual flows of interest @xcite .",
    "another quantity that can also be used to characterize the cascade processes is the velocity space - time correlation function , defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is one of the components of the velocity vector at position @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . ) velocity at @xmath18 . for simplicity , we consider here only the situation that @xmath20 is in the direction of @xmath17 , i.e. the longitudinal velocity correlations .",
    "[ studies of other kinds of velocity correlations , such as those between the wall - normal velocity component and the streamwise component , could be found in @xcite . ] again , the velocity temporal auto - correlation function @xmath21 , based on the pointwise measurements , is the quantity most often studied in experiments and taylor s frozen - flow hypothesis is usually used to translate @xmath21 in time domain to @xmath22 in space domain .",
    "when taylor s hypothesis holds , we have @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mean velocity of the flow .",
    "such a relation implies that @xmath0 would keep constant at increasing @xmath9 and @xmath13 once the value of @xmath26 remains constant , which violates the basic properties of the correlations that @xmath0 decays to zero at sufficient large separations .",
    "therefore , taylor hypothesis holds only for the limited ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "recently , based on a second order approximation to @xmath0 , @xcite advanced an elliptic model for turbulent shear flows and proposed that @xmath0 could be related to @xmath1 via @xmath27 where @xmath3 is a characteristic convection velocity proportional to the mean velocity @xmath25 and @xmath4 is a characteristic velocity associated with the r.m.s .",
    "velocity and the shear - induced velocity @xcite .",
    "specifically , when @xmath4 vanishes , ( [ eq : re ] ) is degenerated to the taylor s hypothesis ( [ eq : rt ] ) , while kraichnan s sweeping - velocity hypothesis @xcite is obtained if @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "the he s elliptic model provides a useful tool for a large set of flow systems where the taylor s hypothesis does not hold and hence the validity of the model in various practical flows needs to be tested .    in this paper , we want to validate the elliptic model in turbulent convection , an important class of turbulent flows that play an central role in many natural and engineering processes .",
    "the flow at hand is turbulent rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection , i.e. the convective motion of an enclosed fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above , which has received tremendous attention during the past few decades ( ahlers , grossmann @xmath28 lohse 2009 ; lohse @xmath28 xia 2010 ) .",
    "although it has long been recognized that the conditions for taylor s hypothesis are often not met in the system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , single - point or time - domain measurements are employed by most experimental investigators for the studies of turbulent cascade processes of both the velocity and temperature fields ( see the recent review paper , lohse @xmath28 xia 2010 , and references therein ) . to translate correctly the quantities measured in time domain to those in space domain , it is thus essential to validate the elliptic model in turbulent rb convection",
    "recently , he , he @xmath28 tong ( 2010 ) verified indirectly the elliptic model via the local temperature data as in the bulk region of turbulent rb convection temperature behaves as a passive scalar ( calzavarini , toschi @xmath28 tripiccione 2002 ; xi _ et al . _ 2009 ) , which is driven by the velocity field via a linear equation .",
    "the authors showed that the elliptic relation ( [ eq : re ] ) is valid for the temperature space - time correlations measured in the cell s sidewall region , but at the cell center they did not observe the predicted relation ( [ eq : re ] ) for the temperature field .",
    "however , a passive additive may display characteristics so different from those of the advecting velocity field @xcite .",
    "in addition , the temperature field is nearly homogeneous in the cell s central region .",
    "the lack of temperature contrast would make the local temperature not follow the behaviors of the velocity field , e.g. the local velocity fluctuations show strong oscillations at the cell center @xcite , while the oscillation is absent for temperature measured at the same location @xcite , and hence it is not surprising that ( [ eq : re ] ) does not hold for temperature in the cell s central region .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to verify the elliptic model _ directly _ via the velocity field , which is the object of the present experimental investigation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give detailed descriptions of the experimental apparatus and conditions and the measuring technique in @xmath292 .",
    "experimental results are presented and analyzed in @xmath293 , which is divided into three parts . in @xmath303.1 and 3.2 , we study the properties of longitudinal space - time correlation functions of the vertical velocity near the cell sidewall and at the cell center , respectively .",
    "section 3.3 presents results of longitudinal space - time correlations of the vertical velocity along the cell s diameter at the middle height of the cell and of longitudinal space - time correlations of the horizontal velocity along the cell s central vertical axis .",
    "the properties of the characteristic velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 are also investigated in detail in @xmath293.3 .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in @xmath294 .",
    "the convection cell is similar to that used in previous experiments @xcite , but has a different size @xcite .",
    "it is a vertical cylinder of height @xmath31 cm and inner diameter @xmath32 cm and hence of unit aspect ratio .",
    "deionized and degassed water was used as the convecting fluid .",
    "the cell s sidewall is a plexiglas tube of 5 mm in wall thickness and a square - shaped jacket made of flat plexiglas plates and filled with water is fitted round the sidewall , which greatly reduced the distortion effect to the piv images caused by the curvature of the cylindrical sidewall .",
    "the top and bottom plates are made of pure copper with nickel - plated fluid - contact surfaces .",
    "the thickness of the top plate is 3 cm and that of the bottom one is 1.5 cm .",
    "four spiral channels of 1.2 cm in width and 1.5 cm in depth are machined into the top plate and the separation between adjacent channels is 1.1 cm .",
    "the channels start from the center and end near the edge of the plate .",
    "a silicon rubber sheet and a plexiglas plate are fixed on the top to form the cover and also to prevent interflow between the channels .",
    "each channel is connected to a separate refrigerated circulator ( polyscience 9712 ) that has a temperature stability of 0.01 @xmath33c .",
    "the channels and the circulators are connected such that the incoming cooler fluid and the outgoing warmer fluid in adjacent channels always flow in opposite directions .",
    "four quarter - circular kapton film heaters , connected in parallel to a dc power supply ( xantrex xdc 300 - 20 ) with 99.99@xmath34 long - term stability , are sandwiched to the back side of the bottom plate to provide constant and uniform heating .",
    "therefore , the experiments were conducted under constant heating of the bottom plate while maintaining a constant temperature at the top plate .",
    "eight thermistors are embedded beneath the fluid - contact surface of each conducting plate , equally spaced azimuthally at about one - third radius from the edge .",
    "the measured relative temperature differences among eight thermistors in the same plate are found to be smaller than 3@xmath34 of that across the fluid layer .    during the experiment",
    "the entire cell was wrapped by several layers of styrofoam and the cell was tilted by a small angle of about 0.5@xmath33 ( ahlers , brown @xmath28 nikolaenko 2006 ) so that the measurements were carried out within the vertical plane of the large - scale circulation .",
    "the mean temperature of water was kept at 29@xmath33 , corresponding to a prandtl number @xmath35 .",
    "the experiment covered the range @xmath36 of the rayleigh number @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the gravitational acceleration , @xmath39 the temperature difference across the fluid layer , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 being , respectively , the thermal expansion coefficient , the kinematic viscosity , and the thermal diffusivity of water . as all measurements give the same qualitative results , only that for @xmath43 will be presented in this paper . at this @xmath44 ,",
    "the period of the large - scale circulation is around 62 sec .",
    "the details of the particle image velocimetry ( piv ) measurements in turbulent rb convection have been described and discussed by xia , sun @xmath28 zhou ( 2003 ) and sun , xia @xmath28 tong ( 2005 ) , here we give only its main features .",
    "the laser lightsheet thickness is @xmath45 mm and the seed particles are 50-@xmath46m - diameter polyamid spheres ( density 1.03 g/@xmath47 ) .",
    "as the seed particles are neutrally buoyant , they are assumed to follow the motion of the fluid .",
    "the measuring region has an area of @xmath48 @xmath49 with a spatial resolution of 7.76 mm , corresponding to @xmath50 velocity vectors .",
    "we chose the vertical rotation plane of the large - scale circulation as the laser - illuminated plane , defined as the @xmath51 plane .",
    "the cartesian coordinate is defined such that the origin @xmath52 coincides with the cell center , the @xmath53 axis points to the right , and the @xmath54 axis points upwards . the horizontal velocity component @xmath55 and the vertical one @xmath56 were obtained .",
    "the experiment lasted 145 minutes in which a total of 20000 two - dimensional vector maps were acquired with a sampling rate of @xmath57 hz . figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the measured mean flow field , together with the cartesian coordinates used in the experiment . in the figure , the magnitude of the mean velocity @xmath58 are coded both by color and by the length of the arrows , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the time - averaged horizontal and vertical components of the velocity vector , respectively .",
    "one sees clearly that the mean flow is a clockwise rotatory motion with a relatively quiet central region and high velocity regions concentrated along the perimeter of the cell . to see whether the taylor s frozen - flow hypothesis is valid or not in turbulent rb system , we plot in figure [ fig : fig2 ] the spatial distributions of the ratios between the time - averaged and the r.m.s .",

    "the piv technique provides us a convenient tool to directly and simultaneously measure the local fluctuating velocities at multi - points in a particular plane of interest . with the measured @xmath67 and @xmath68",

    "we first study the properties of longitudinal space - time correlations for the vertical velocity , @xmath71 , near the cell sidewall ( @xmath72 cm ) at the middle height of the cell ( @xmath73 cm ) , where the mean and the r.m.s velocities are of the same order [ see figure [ fig : fig1](_b _ ) ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3](_a _ ) shows the flood contours of the measured @xmath71 as a function of separations @xmath9 and @xmath13 and the corresponding isocorrelation contours are plotted in figure [ fig : fig3](_b _ ) . by definition ,",

    "furthermore , all isocorrelation contours appear to be self - similar , i.e. , they share the same preferred orientation and the same aspect ratio .",
    "one also sees that @xmath76 decays relatively slowly in the preference direction , but drops much faster in the direction that is perpendicular to the preference direction .    to determine the characteristic velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 in ( [ eq : re ] ) , note that from the conditions @xmath77 and @xmath78 we have , respectively , @xmath79r,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 maximizes @xmath76 for a given @xmath13 and @xmath81",

    "our results show that the isocorrelation contours of space - time correlations are elliptic closed curves and the space - time correlations @xmath122 and @xmath76 can be related to the space correlations @xmath129 and @xmath87 , respectively , via the elliptic relation ( [ eq : re ] ) , i.e. @xmath2 . the characteristic velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 were then calculated and studied .",
    "we find that the magnitude of @xmath3 reaches its maximum value near the sidewall and plates and decreases when away from the walls and plates , while the position - dependence of @xmath4 is much weaker .",
    "specifically , at the cell center we have @xmath5 and hence the relation ( [ eq : re ] ) becomes @xmath132 with its major and minor axes coinciding with the @xmath13- and @xmath9-axis .",
    "note that such relation has the same form as kraichnan s sweeping - velocity hypothesis @xcite .",
    "direct comparison of the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and their theoretical predictions further show that @xmath3 is proportional to the mean velocity of the flow , while @xmath4 is systematically larger than its prediction .",
    "our results validate the elliptic model in turbulent rb convection , where taylor s frozen - flow hypothesis does not hold due to the relatively large values of the r.m.s . velocity . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the elliptic model is developed based on a second - order approximation , while taylor s hypothesis implies a first - order approximation .",
    "thus , the elliptic model is a generation of taylor s frozen - flow hypothesis and taylor s hypothesis is only a special case of the elliptic model [ i.e. , when @xmath133 the elliptic model s relation ( [ eq : re ] ) is degenerated to the taylor s relation ( [ eq : rt ] ) ] . like taylor s hypothesis ,",
    "the elliptic model could also be used to translate time series to space series .",
    "this is because the correlation function is a basic quantity and most statistical properties interested in the field of turbulence , such as structure function and power spectrum , can be obtained theoretically from the correlation functions .",
    "in fact , previous work by @xcite has used the model to translate the temperature power spectrum from time domain to space domain .",
    "an important implication of the elliptic model is that when @xmath119 , the relation ( [ eq : re ] ) becomes @xmath134 in this case , @xmath9 is still proportional to @xmath13 but just that the proportionality constant is @xmath135 , rather than the mean velocity @xmath25 as stated in the taylor s hypothesis [ see ( [ eq : rt ] ) with @xmath119 ] .",
    "this implies that if one is only interested in the scaling exponents of @xmath22 in space domain , such scaling properties can still be correctly obtained by studying the scaling of @xmath21 in time domain in the elliptic model even though taylor s hypothesis is not valid .",
    "we note that taylor s hypothesis has been widely used to study the scaling behaviors of structure functions and power spectrum of the velocity and temperature fields in turbulent rb convection @xcite .",
    "however , it has long been known in the field that the condition for taylor s hypothesis is not often net @xcite , and hence the results based on taylor s hypothesis is questionable and not convincible . here",
    ", the relation ( [ eq : re0 ] ) implies that one does not really need the validity of taylor s hypothesis to reconstruct the space series from the measured time series .",
    "however , taylor s hypothesis could not yield the correct scaling ranges in space domain , which could only be obtained upon the transform of ( [ eq : re0 ] ) in the elliptic model .",
    "it should be noted that in the original elliptic model @xcite the correlations @xmath137 were considered , while we studied the normalized quantities @xmath138 here . the elliptic relation ( [ eq : re ] ) holds for both @xmath139 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , if the r.m.s .",
    "velocity @xmath19 depends on position , the characteristic velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath139 may be different from those for @xmath0 .",
    "we note that previous works usually focused on @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the present work ,",
    "we have also checked the properties of @xmath139 and the similar results were obtained .",
