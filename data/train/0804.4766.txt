    "micro- and nano - mechanical resonators have been an interesting research topic due to their broad application in technology and fundamental physics @xcite .",

    "many of the applications are fundamentally limited by thermal fluctuations , and in order to reduce their effects , it is desirable to cool the mechanical oscillators . recently , various schemes like the laser sideband cooling schemes developed for trapped ions and atoms @xcite , have been proposed for significantly cooling a mechanical resonator ( mr ) coupled to a cooper - pair box @xcite , a flux qubit @xcite , a superconducting single - electron transistor @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and optical cavities @xcite . on the experimental side , optomechanical cooling schemes have been shown to be promising @xcite : the mr was cooled to ultra - low temperatures via either photothermal forces or radiation pressure by coupling it to a driven cavity .",
    "there are two main optomechanical cooling schemes .",
    "the first one involves an active feedback loop @xcite , and the second one works via passive back - action cooling ( also called self - cooling ) @xcite .",
    "a fully quantum - mechanical description of cavity - assisted cooling schemes for optomechanical systems has been given in refs .",
    "@xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "ground - state cooling of a mechanical resonator via passive cooling schemes based on radiation pressure has also been investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "recently , other optomechanical - like cooling schemes have been proposed to replace the optical cavity by a radio - frequency ( rf ) circuit @xcite or a one - dimensional transmission line resonator ( tlr ) @xcite . however , the theoretical understanding of the cooling schemes via a rf circuit in refs .",
    "@xcite or via a tlr in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a classical description of the motion of the mr .",
    "a quantum - mechanical description of the motion of the mr , in a similar system consisting of a mechanical resonator capacitively coupled to a superconducting coplanar waveguide ( which is an example of a tlr ) , was discussed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focused on studying the entanglement between the mr and the tlr without considering the cooling of mr .",
    "most recently , teufel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the cooling of a mr by applying directly the theoretical analysis of the cavity - assisted back - action cooling scheme @xcite to a superconducting microwave resonator .",
    "they also presented experimental data about the cooling effect on the mr due to the microwave radiation field .",
    "the quantum - mechanical description of tlr - assisted cooling of a mr has also been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite via embedding a squid @xcite , which allows to control the coupling strength between mr and tlr by controlling the flux through the squid .",
    "there are some practical advantages @xcite in the microwave tlr schemes .",
    "the tlr is realized in a thin on - chip superconducting film and is easily pre - cooled by standard dilution refrigeration techniques .",
    "it is ready to be integrated with quantum circuits containing josephson junctions which may offer a sensitive measurement and a connection with quantum information processing .",
    "in addition , the size of the mechanical resonator could be much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation in the tlr , unlike in optical cavity experiments that work with reflection .    in this paper , we present a quantum - mechanical description and use it to investigate the motion of the mr when it is coupled capacitively to a driven tlr as in ref .",
    "@xcite where the calculation was carried out in a semi - classical framework .",
    "the hamiltonian of our tlr - assisted model is also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and is very similar to that of a mr coupled to a driven optical cavity via radiation pressure coupling @xcite .",
    "we study the tlr - assisted passive back - action cooling of a mr in detail by using a quantum langevin description ( without taking into account quantum entanglement @xcite between the mr and the tlr ) .",
    "one of the main results of our work is to show that the mr can be cooled close to its ground state using realistic parameters : final effective mean phonon numbers below @xmath0 can be reached assuming an initial temperature of @xmath1 mk which can be achieved using a dilution refrigerator .",
    "we discuss in detail how such a ground state cooling of the mr can be obtained for all kind of parameter choices in practice .",
    "the system that we consider is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : a mr is fixed on both ends ( or a cantilever fixed on one end ) located at the center of the tlr and is coupled capacitively to the central conductor of the tlr @xcite .",
    "we restrict the description to the fundamental flexural mode of oscillation of the mr which is modeled as a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath2 and effective mass @xmath3 .",

    "the first term in the second line is the capacitive coupling between the tlr and the mr .",
    "actually , it describes the capacitive energy between them .",
    "the mr and the tlr are assumed to form a capacitor with the capacitance @xmath15 ( for small displacement ) depending on the position of the mr along the @xmath11-direction ( @xmath16 is the initial equilibrium distance without the coupling and @xmath17 the corresponding initial capacitance ; typically @xmath18 @xmath19 m @xcite ) .",
    "the capacitor is assumed to be placed in the center of the structure , i.e. , its voltage is given by the antinode voltage of the second mode : @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the rms voltage @xcite ) , since the length of the mr is usually much shorter than that of the tlr : @xmath22 cm @xmath23 @xmath19 m .",

    "we will focus on the case of a micro - mr for which the condition @xmath2",

    ", the hamiltonian reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a real coupling constant ; @xmath41 is the detuning , and @xmath42 is the modified frequency of the tlr shifted by the coupling between tlr and mr .",
    "this hamiltonian resembles that used in cavity - assisted cooling schemes @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the capacitive - coupling scheme in a microwave tlr can be used to cool the mr like in the case of radiation - pressure cooling in an optical cavity .",
    "the dynamics is also determined by fluctuation - dissipation processes that affect both the tlr and the mechanical mode .",
    "they are taken into account in a fully consistent way by the quantum langevin equations @xcite :    [ nonlinlang1 ] @xmath43    here @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the noise operator due to the external microwave drive , and @xmath46 denotes the quantum brownian force that the resonator is subject to .",

    "we now perform a similar calculation as that given in refs .",
    "the steady - state solution of the quantum langevin equations  ( [ nonlinlang1 ] ) can be obtained by first replacing the operators by their average and then setting @xmath52 .",

    "rewriting each operator as a @xmath57-number steady - state value plus an additional fluctuation operator , and neglecting the nonlinear terms ( since we have chosen @xmath58 ) , we obtain a set of linear quantum langevin equations ( see eq .",
    "( [ nonlinlang42 ] ) ) and then solve for the spectrum of the position and momentum of the mr as in refs .",

    "the final effective mean phonon number of the mr can be calculated directly by evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) numerically and using eq .",
