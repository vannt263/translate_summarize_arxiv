    "in the last decade , while interferometric detectors were approaching , through a series of commissioning runs , their target sensitivity , resonant bar detectors continued to reliably observe the cosmos for very long periods of time , looking for unmodeled impulsive gravitational waveforms ( gw ) from galactic sources .",
    "for the purpose of coordinating this search effort , the four cryogenic , resonant mass detectors ( plus , in an early stage , the australian antenna niobe ) joined forces in a collaborative agreement called igec ( international gravitational event collaboration ) that mainly consisted of a protocol for data exchange and analysis .",
    "the igec collaboration analyzed almost 4 years of data from 5 antennas @xcite@xcite .",
    "this protocol was later revised and renamed igec2 : among other changes , it included coordination on scheduling routine maintenance operations ( refills of cryogenic fluids ) in order to ensure maximal time coverage with at least 3 of the 4 detectors . a first period of 6 months of data was analyzed and published under the new protocol @xcite : it yielded a negative result ( no gw candidates ) but it was instrumental in setting up and testing network analysis procedures that were the starting point from which the present analysis has evolved .",
    "the detectors taking part in the igec2 network are : allegro , located at louisiana state university ( louisiana - usa ) and operated by the local allegro group , auriga , located in the legnaro national laboratories ( padova - italy ) of infn and operated by the auriga collaboration , explorer , located at cern ( geneva - switzerland ) and nautilus , located in the frascati national laboratories ( frascati - italy ) of infn .",
    "both latter detectors are operated by the rog collaboration .",
    "auriga , explorer and nautilus all benefit from support from infn , while allegro was funded by nsf .",
    "this network of four detectors , all operating with high duty cycle and large overlap time , is effective in rejecting spurious candidate events caused by transient local disturbances or by intrinsic detector noise .",
    "the sensitivity of these antennas has been superseded by the much superior performance of large interferometers like ligo and virgo .",
    "therefore , igec2 upper limits on the gw flux on earth are no longer astrophysically significant so in this paper we target the possible detection of a rare , impulsive event with long term observations .    in the previous runs of this network ,",
    "either the sensitivity of the antennas was lower @xcite@xcite , or the observation lasted for a much shorter stretch of time @xcite .",
    "the ligo observatory has also carried out searches for bursts , both with its three interferometers @xcite@xcite@xcite and in a coincidence run with geo @xcite .",
    "the first published results @xcite of the ligo s5 run report a relevant advance in these searches , yielding a significant lowering in the previously published upper limits .",
    "that work refers to the period november 2005 through november 2006 , covered with a @xmath1 duty cycle .",
    "the same period is covered by the present work , clearly with a lower sensitivity , but with a much larger duty cycle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "for this reason it can be used in conjunction with this early phase of s5 , when the most common periods were stretches of time with only one interferometer taking data .",
    "several astrophysical processes can generate gravitational radiation in the sensitive bandwidth of the igec2 detectors ( all centered around 900 hz ) : among these , stellar core collapse @xcite , final phase of inspiralling and ring down in merger of compact binary systems , as well as rotational instabilities and quasi - normal mode oscillations of relativistic stars @xcite @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of these events , according to current estimates @xcite are such that an event in our galaxy ( say within a few kpc ) can be detected by the resonant antennas . in view of the large uncertainty in the modeling of these waveforms and of the restricted bandwidth of our detectors",
    ", we search our data for unmodeled , featureless short bursts : as in the previous search @xcite , we aimed at signals with typical durations up to a few tens of milliseconds ( see the analysis of sect [ sec : network ] ) , e.g. damped sinusoids , ring down , or gaussian bursts .",
    "the main advances reported here refer to a detailed analysis on the choices of the coincidence window and of the thresholds strategy , carried out through an extensive use of software injections of pulses in the data .",
    "in addition , we analyzed a substantial stretch of time of fourfold operation .",
    "this paper describes the results of 17 months of observation , from nov .",
    "16@xmath3 2005 to apr .",
    "14@xmath3 2007 , containing the longest reported period of fourfold coincidence observation , 293.5 days out of 515 . indeed , in the first igec search , published in 2003 @xcite , only 26 days of fourfold observation were collected at a much lower sensitivity , in a four year span and using five antennas . in the 2007 paper@xcite we only analyzed threefold coincidences .",
    "the goal of this observation campaign , just as in that reported in @xcite was to look for coincidence events with a background of accidentals of 1 per century .",
    "this low level of false alarm was achieved with a suitable choice of the thresholds applied to the candidate event lists produced by each group , as discussed in detail in sect.[sec : network ] .",
    "we chose to undertake five searches in parallel : one four - fold coincidence search and four triple coincidence searches , _ a priori _ assigning to each a false alarm rate ( far ) of @xmath4 .",
    "once these five searches are combined in a logical or , the desired level of far is achieved .",
    "two - fold coincidences were not analyzed , since in order to achieve a reasonable value of the far , we should have had to raise the thresholds so much that the efficiency would have been even lower than for the threefolds .    in the following section we review some features of the network , of its detectors and of the procedure used to produce the exchanged data .",
    "in sect [ sec : network ] we describe the study carried out to evaluate the background and set up the corresponding cuts in the data that guarantee the desired far .",
    "finally the results of the search are presented and discussed in the last section .",
    "the four cryogenic resonant gw detectors that are part of the igec2 network are reliable and stable machines .",
    "their long term noise performance is rather stationary .",
    "therefore , both the general observatory description and the noise characterization of the antennas are substantially unchanged with respect to that described in @xcite . while detailed description of the equipment can be found in @xcite for auriga , in @xcite for explorer and nautilus and in @xcite for the allegro detector , respectively , here we will just recall the common features of the antennas .",
    "these four detectors are very similar in their experimental set up .",
    "they all consist of a 3 m long aluminum bar , suspended in vacuum in a cryogenic environment .",
    "the quantity we monitor and analyze , in search of an event generated by gw , is the amplitude of vibration of the first longitudinal elastic mode of the cylinder , resonating around 900 hz .",
    "this signal is intrinsically narrow band , the bandwidth being set by the interplay between thermal ( resonant ) noise and amplifier ( wide - band ) noise and reaching at best 10% of the operating frequency .",
    "for this reason , the signal we can extract from the antenna vibration can be related to the fourier amplitude @xmath5 at the resonant frequency of an hypothetical short gw signal , rather than to the wave amplitude @xmath6 itself .",
    "the spectral sensitivity curves of the four antennas are shown in fig.[fig : shh ] .",
    "different spectral shapes in the various detectors arise from particular choices of the antenna - readout coupling .",
    "indeed , the resonant transducer that is used to convert the bar vibration into an electric signal ( a light mass mechanical oscillator , whose vibrations modulate an electric or magnetic field ) , is different in the four detectors .",
    "while allegro has a superconducting , persistent - current , inductance - modulation device , auriga , nautilus and explorer rely on a capacitive , constant charge biased transducer . in all detectors",
    "the first stage amplifier is a d.c .",
    "squid , an ultra - low noise device .",
    "auriga indeed uses a double d.c .",
    "squid with the matching lc circuit tuned to the mechanical antenna frequency ( resulting in a three mode resonant system ) . on the other hand , explorer and nautilus ,",
    "while using a loosely tuned @xcite matching circuit , employ a very small gap capacitor ( @xmath7 ) to achieve a high electromechanical coupling . in allegro , due to the low source impedance of the inductive transducer ,",
    "no matching transformer is needed .",
    "both nautilus and auriga are equipped with dilution refrigerators that allow them to operate at ultralow temperature . however , because of reliability and duty cycle considerations , they were in this case operated at about 3 - 4 k , like explorer and allegro . with respect to the spectral sensitivity curves shown in @xcite , the @xmath8 of explorer now has a more symmetric shape .",
    "this is due to a small change in the bias voltage of the resonant capacitive transducer that was implemented in april 2006 .",
    "all four detectors require periodic down - time for cryogenic maintenance , typically one or two days per month for refilling cryogenic fluids .",
    "a coordination effort was made to undertake maintenance duties on different days for each apparatus , in order to maximize the time with at least three detectors simultaneously in operation .",
    "as a result , we achieved the observation times described in table [ table : giorni ] , that shows that we had three or more antennas operating for 94% of the entire 515 day period with data quality suitable for science goals ."
