    "nematic liquid crystals ( nlc ) confined in restricted geometries are technologically important  @xcite and have been the subject of intense studies over the past few decades  @xcite .",
    "anisotropy of the vast majority of nlcs is locally uniaxial and molecules of a nlc align on average along a local unit director .",
    "orientational structures in nlcs are thus defined by distributions of the director @xmath6 and the well - established continuum elastic theory provides the phenomenological description of orientational distortions  @xcite .    in the absence of external fields ,",
    "orientational structures in spatially bounded nlcs crucially depend on the conditions at confining walls .",
    "these are macroscopically characterized by the surface contribution to the elastic free energy , @xmath7 , that adds to the frank elastic energy , @xmath8 , describing elasticity of nlc in the bulk , to yield the total elastic free energy of a nlc in the presence of the confining surfaces @xmath9=f_b[{\\mathbf{n}}]+f_s[{\\mathbf{n } } ] , \\ ] ] @xmath10 ^ 2 \\bigr]{\\mathrm{d}}v , \\ ] ] @xmath11 \\bigr]{\\mathrm{d}}s,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the splay , twist and bend elastic constants , respectively ; @xmath0 is the saddle - splay elastic constant ; @xmath15 is the outer normal to the surface @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the surface density of the anchoring energy .",
    "an important point is that , in addition to the anchoring energy which is the anisotropic part of the surface tension , there is also the elastic contribution to the surface free energy that , originally , has been indicated as a part of the elastic energy having the form of a divergence  @xcite .",
    "this contribution    the so - called saddle - splay term ( the @xmath0 term )    can generally be viewed as the tangential director gradient dependent elastic part of the surface energy  @xcite .",
    "the other surface elastic term known as the @xmath18 term will not be considered in this paper as it can be ignored in cases where spatial variations of the density and the scalar order parameter are of minor importance  @xcite .    in the last years",
    "@xmath0 specific issues have attracted much less attention than the fundamental difficulties caused by the @xmath18 term .",
    "in particular , though the exact measurements of @xmath0 are still missing it was experimentally estimated to be of the order of the frank elastic constants  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important theoretical results is that the @xmath0 term may induce spontaneous twist deformations in hybrid nematic films with azimuthally degenerate anchoring conditions  @xcite .",
    "such deformations are manifested in the formation of periodic stripe domains observed in sufficiently thin hybrid nlc cells  @xcite .    for planar nlc cells ,",
    "similar instability of the ground state in the presence of the @xmath0 term was considered in refs .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , barbero and pergamenshchik suggested that in the proximity of the nematic - smectic-@xmath19 transition the @xmath0 term grows anomalously large so as to violate the ericksen stability conditions  @xcite : @xmath20 as a result , the uniform equilibrium director distribution becomes unstable and a periodically modulated nematic phase may occur in sufficiently thin planar films .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are essentially limited to the special case in which the azimuthal anchoring strength is identically zero .",
    "but the study of possible mechanisms leading to the formation of modulated orientational structures close to the nematic - smectic-@xmath19 transition requires a quantitatively accurate description of the instability that goes beyond this limitation . at this stage , however , even the instability scenario as a whole has not been studied in any detail .    in this paper",
    "we intend to fill the gap .",
    "our primary goal is the comprehensive study of the instability induced by the @xmath0 term in the presence of the azimuthal anchoring .",
    "the idea underlying our general theoretical considerations is that instabilities of this sort occur when the director fluctuations at confining surfaces become critically divergent .",
    "so , we suggest the method connecting the correlation functions of director fluctuations and the computational procedure applied to perform the stability analysis . this method is based on separating out the surface part of the correlator as a correlation function of the fluctuation field induced by the director fluctuations at confining walls .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : corr - funct ] , we express the surface part of the static correlation functions of the director fluctuations as a functional integral over fluctuations at confining walls and explicitly relate the procedure for computing the correlators to the stability conditions used in our stability analysis .",

    "[ subsec : corr - fluct - nemat ] .",
    "we characterize the mirror symmetry properties of the fluctuation harmonics and calculate the surface part of the correlator .",

    "stability of the uniform planar orientational structure is studied in sec .",

    "we analyze the parameterization of the boundary curve enclosing the instability region in the thickness ",
    "wavelength plane and show that , in addition to the stability interval  , there are two different intervals for @xmath0 : ( a )  @xmath21 , where the critical point is characterized by the critical thickness @xmath3 and the critical fluctuation wavelength @xmath2 ; ( b )  @xmath22 , where nlc cells of any thickness are unstable with respect to the short wavelength fluctuations with @xmath23 .",
    "it is found that the critical fluctuation mode is antisymmetric at @xmath24 and is symmetric at @xmath25 . the critical thickness and the critical wavelength",
    "are computed as functions of @xmath0 and the azimuthal anchoring strength .",
    "we also discuss the spectrum of director fluctuations at the substrates near the critical thickness .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] , we present our results and make some concluding remarks . details on some technical results are relegated to appendixes  [ sec : append ] and  [ sec : append - b ] .",
    "in this section we consider the general procedure for computing the correlation functions ( correlators ) of nlc director fluctuations in confined geometry .",
    "we remind the reader about the standard approach that uses functional integrals to represent averaging over fluctuations  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the effect of the confining surface enters the theory through the boundary conditions for the saddle point equations ( euler - lagrange equations ) and for the green functions .",
    "we then describe an alternative procedure , where the part of the fluctuation field representing the director fluctuations at the surface is separated out by shifting the integration variable in the functional integral .",
    "the corresponding part of the correlator is defined by the surface part of the free energy   and involves averaging over the fluctuations at the surface .",
    "finally , we show that the free energy of these fluctuations determines stability of orientational structures .      assuming that the director field @xmath26 defines the unperturbed orientational structure , we shall write the distorted configuration in the form @xmath27 where the brackets denote the scalar product . locally , the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath28 form the @xmath26@xmath28 plane , so that the angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 describe in - plane and out - of - plane orientational distortions , respectively .    substituting eq .   into eqs .",

    "the problem   is at the heart of the conventional computational procedures traditionally used , e.g. , in studies of light scattering in confined liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the effects caused by the anchoring energy and the surface elasticity constant are solely incorporated into the boundary conditions  .",
    "these conditions affect eigenfunctions ( normal fluctuation modes ) and eigenvalues of the operator @xmath39 that can be used to derive the green function in the form of an expansion over the eigenfunctions .",
    "the eigenvalues form the spectrum of fluctuations and must be positive provided the orientational structure @xmath26 is stable . otherwise , the functional integrals   and   do not converge .",

    "these conditions are in considerable use as stability criteria in several methods developed to study fredericksz - type transitions in confined liquid crystals  @xcite .",

    "when the free energy   is not positive definite and the conditions @xmath90 are violated , the correlator   becomes divergent .",
    "so , stability of the orientational structure with respect to the director fluctuations at the confining surface is determined by the stability conditions  .",
    "instabilities induced by such fluctuations are of our primary concern , since neither the anchoring energy nor the @xmath0 term may affect the correlator of the bulk fluctuation field  .",
    "technically , using the conditions   enormously simplifies stability analysis as compared to exploring the spectrum of fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the procedure involves two steps : ( a )  solving the boundary value problem for the euler - lagrange equations  ; and ( b )  evaluating the free energy of the fluctuations at the surface  . finally , the stability conditions are derived as the conditions for the free energy to be positive definite .    equivalent computational schemes have already been used to study surface elasticity effects in refs .",
    "we have thus developed the method at the very least linking these schemes and the surface part of the correlator that takes into account the director fluctuations at the confining surface .    in the next section",
    "we apply the above described procedure to the case of the planar orientational structure in nlc cell . as an advantage of our approach",

    "does not imply using the rapini - papoular potential  @xcite , where @xmath102 .",
    "it is , however , more reasonable to consider the case in which the zenithal and the azimuthal anchoring energies differ , because the surface energy costs for splay - bend and twist director deformations in interfacial layers are different ( recent discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the cell is invariant under translations in the @xmath95@xmath103 plane and we impose the periodic conditions on the angles : @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the characteristic lengths of the cell along the @xmath95 and @xmath103 axes , respectively .",
