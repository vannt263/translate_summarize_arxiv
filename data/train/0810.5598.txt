    "this paper is concerned with spectral bounds for dirac operators on noncompact riemannian manifolds .",

    "examples are the classical dirac operator acting on spinors , the operator @xmath0 acting on forms , and the operator @xmath1 on a khler manifold .    in section  [ sec : friedrich ] we show that friedrich s lower bound for the eigenvalues of the classical dirac operator on a compact spin manifold of positive scalar curvature extends to a lower bound for the fundamental tone of the square of any dirac operator even if the manifold @xmath2 is incomplete . if @xmath2 is complete this implies a spectral gap for the dirac operator itself .",

    "we give a simple proof of lichnerowicz classical lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue of the laplace operator on a compact manifold with positive ricci curvature .    in section  [ sec : essential ] we study the essential spectrum .",
    "we show that if the curvature endomorphism of the dirac operator is bounded from below at infinity , then a friedrich - lichnerowicz type estimate holds for the essential spectrum .",
    "in particular , this yields a sufficient criterion for a dirac operator on a complete manifold to be a fredholm operator .",
    "if the curvature endomorphism tends to infinity at infinity , then the spectrum of the square of the dirac operator is discrete just as in the case of a compact manifold .    in the last section we study the classical dirac operator on surfaces .",
    "we show that if @xmath2 is a connected surface of genus @xmath3 with finite area and if the spin structure is bounding at infinity , then @xmath4 here @xmath2 need not be complete and may have infinitely many ends . if one drops the assumption on the spin structure , then the estimate fails .",
