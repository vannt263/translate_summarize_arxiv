    "higher loop calculations present great difficulties especially in the presence of masses . when there is a large number of parameters ( masses and external momenta ) in the problem , analytic expressions can hardly be obtained beyond one - loop . in such cases",
    "one has to resort to numerical or approximative methods . in particular the rather large spectrum of masses in the standard model requires numerous and different approximation schemes ( e.g. small fermion masses @xmath3 , close vector boson masses @xmath4 , large top mass @xmath5 etc . ) and often a problem is reduced to diagrams with one mass .    in this work",
    "we consider the evaluation of 2-loop diagrams of self - energy and vertex type with one non - zero mass and all others zero .    for the analytic evaluation of ` master integrals ' with masses various techniques have been developed .",
    "such calculations in qed are known since @xcite .",
    "using dispersion relations 2-loop 2-point integrals relevant for qed and qcd were obtained in @xcite .",
    "results for a class of 2-loop self energies are given in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the method of differential equations was developed in @xcite .",
    "some recent results , applying this method for 2-loop vertex functions , are presented in @xcite . at the 3-loop order analytic results",
    "are known only for vacuum bubbles so far @xcite .",
    "very powerful approaches for the evaluation of diagrams , which are in fact our starting point , are the asymptotic expansion @xcite and/or taylor expansion @xcite in an external momentum squared , which are identical if only one non - zero mass is involved .",
    "these methods allow to expand a diagram in a series with coefficients , which in many cases can be represented in a relatively simple analytic form",
    ". analytic continuation by means of a mapping in the plane of momentum squared allows to calculate the diagrams on their cut . for propagator type diagrams",
    "such expansion was successfully applied in @xcite while for vertex functions it is discussed in @xcite .",
    "so far the method of expansion is considered as semianalytic in the sence that only a limited number of coefficients can be obtained explicitely . in this paper , however , we want to go one step further .",
    "we calculate the first few coefficients of the expansion of a diagram with only one non - zero mass by means of the asymptotic expansion @xcite method .",
    "the method of differential equations @xcite then yields an idea , like in @xcite , what the general analytic form of these coefficients might be , providing some ` basis ' in terms of which they might be expressed .",
    "the ansatz of equating the explicit coefficients obtained from the asymptotic expansion to a linear combination in terms of the basis elements , yields a system of linear equations , which can be solved to yield the desired representation of the coefficients .",
    "the main problem in this approach is the choice of the basis elements .",
    "we start from so - called harmonic sums which are particularly relevant for moments of structure functions in qcd ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these functions are directly related to ( generalized ) polylogarithms @xcite and therefore it is not surprising that they appear in the analysis of massive diagrams ( see also recent research about these sums @xcite ) .",
    "however , not every massive diagram even of self - energy type can be expressed in terms of these sums . in particular ,",
    "if a diagram possesses a cut with three massive particles in the intermediate state then it is rather a subject of elliptic integrals than polylogarithmic ones @xcite .",
    "the method should work in this case as well provided one finds the relevant class of basis elements .",
    "however , in this paper we do not consider diagrams of such type and concentrate ourselves on those with one- and/or two - massive - particle ( @xmath6- and @xmath7- ) cuts .",
    "we give the results for all selfenergies and a certain number of vertices with @xmath6- and @xmath7-cuts .",
    "in particular we include diagrams relevant for @xmath8-decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after introducing some notation in sect .",
    "2 , we explain in sect .",
    "3 the main idea of our approach in terms of some simple examples .",
    "4 contains a ` straightforward ' prescription for the generalization of our basis elements , while in sect.5 we demonstrate how to find more complicated ones occurring in @xmath7- cuts . the differential equation method ( dem ) in sect .",
    "6 demonstrates a further method to explore the form of basis elements .",
    "7 contains a proposal of how to perform the large @xmath1-expansion by means of the sommerfeld - watson transformation , providing an explicit example .",
    "the appendices contain further notations and results .",
    "the generic topologies considered in this work are displayed in fig .",
    "lines of the diagrams represent scalar propagators @xmath9 with either mass @xmath6 or zero mass . for both ultraviolet and infrared divergences we use dimensional regularization in the minkowski space with dimension @xmath10 .",
    "each loop integration is normalized as follows @xmath11 with @xmath12 the euler constant .",
    "our starting point is the large mass expansion @xcite of the diagrams .",
    "here we just note that the result of a large mass expansion for these diagrams reads ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimensionality of the diagram , @xmath16 and @xmath17 independent of @xmath18 are the highest degree of divergence and the highest power of @xmath19 , respectively ( in our cases @xmath20 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 are of the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 being rational numbers and @xmath24 is the riemann @xmath25-function .    series ( [ lme ] ) always has a nonzero radius of convergence , which is defined by the position of the nearest nonzero threshold in the @xmath1-channel . for brevity we shall call @xmath6-cuts ( @xmath7-cuts , etc . ) possible cuts of a diagram in @xmath1 corresponding to 1 ( 2 , etc . )",
    "massive particles in the intermediate state .",
    "we start from diagrams with the simplest threshold structure , i.e. with @xmath6-cuts and ( possible ) @xmath26-cuts . such diagrams are particulary easy to handle and results for all of them within the considered generic topologies of fig .",
    "1 can be found in the appendices .",
    "it will be shown that all are expressible in terms of harmonic sums .    as a first example consider the 2-loop 2-point function of fig .",
    "2 , @xmath27 , which was considered in @xcite . using the standard large mass expansion technique one",
    "can get the first few coefficients of the expansion of this diagram in powers of @xmath13 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the riemann @xmath25-function .",
    "it takes seconds to evaluate the first 10 terms ( we use a package written in form @xcite ) but the evaluation time increases exponentially for the higher order terms .",
    "although 1020 coefficients are sufficient to get a very precise numerical value for the diagram , even at @xmath30 ( via conformal mapping and accelerated convergence @xcite ) , this can not be called a satisfying result .",
    "our key observation is that the information contained in the first 10 ( or even less ! )",
    "coefficients of the series ( [ sample1 ] ) is enough to restore the whole series .",
    "namely , each coefficient @xmath31 can be expressed as some combination of harmonic sums and their extensions . in this case",
    "the series can be continued numericaly or analyticaly to any point of the complex @xmath32-plane .",
    "thus our first step is to find an expression for the higher order terms of the series ( [ sample1 ] ) as a functions of @xmath18 i.e. @xmath33 .    to achieve this",
    "let us search for @xmath31 as a linear combination of elements of a certain kind . for these",
    "we take @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( harmonic sum ) . as a matter of observation",
    ", the rule is that one has to take into account all possible products of the type @xmath36 with the transcendentality level ( tl ) @xmath37 .",
    "it is obvious that one can exclude @xmath38 beforehand since it never appears on the r.h.s . of ( [ sample1 ] ) .",
    "thus we have the following ansatz for @xmath31 @xmath39 where @xmath40 are rational numbers independent on @xmath18 and we omitted the arguments in the @xmath41-functions .",
    "these can be taken with argument @xmath18 or @xmath42 .",
    "we choose the latter option .",
    "however , either choice gives a solution since the difference is only in rearranging @xmath34 terms .",
    "later on we refer to the structures in ( [ ansatz ] ) as ` basis elements ' or just ` basis ' . indeed , the functions @xmath43 are algebraically independent .",
    "inserting the expression for @xmath31 from ( [ ansatz ] ) into the l.h.s .",
    "of ( [ sample1 ] ) and equating equal powers of @xmath32 , we obtain a system of linear equations for the @xmath44 .",
    "one needs at least 9 first coefficients on the r.h.s . of ( [ sample1 ] ) to solve the equations for 9 variables and any system of more than 9 equations should be consistent and have the same solution if the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) is correct .",
    "an explicit computation ensures that the system can be solved in terms of rational numbers for the @xmath44 and this latter consistency property holds .",
    "the solution is @xmath45 i.e. the answer for the diagram at hand is @xmath46    this is the desired result .",
    "one notices that in ( [ sample1 ] ) and ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) the terms proportional to @xmath47 are linearly independent and can be treated separately , i.e one could solve a system of linear equations for @xmath48 and another one for @xmath49 . in this sence only the 7 first coefficients of the large mass expansion are required .",
    "series ( [ res1 ] ) converges for @xmath50 and represents in the domain of convergence an analytic function .",
    "it can be analytically continued into the whole @xmath32-plane except for the cut on the real axis starting at @xmath51 where @xmath27 has a branch point ( threshold ) . in particular for the given diagram , summing the series",
    ", we find the representation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a polylogarithm and @xmath54 are the generalized nielsen polylogarithms @xcite ( see also appendix c ) .    both representations ( [ res1 ] ) and ( [ int1 ] ) are equivalent in the sense that they both represent the same analytic function and can be unambiguously converted into each other .",
    "however , we find it more convenient to use the series representation and refer for the continuation to app .",
    "c and e. moreover a series representation is usually shorter than a representation in terms of known functions and/or an integral representation",
    ".    equation ( [ ansatz ] ) can be considered as expansion of the general coefficient @xmath31 in terms of a ` basis ' with ( unknown , rational ) coefficients @xmath44 .",
    "now the question arises : what are the basis elements in general ? definitely there must be a certain connection between the topology and the structure of thresholds of a diagram on the one hand and the structure of the basis elements on the other hand .",
    "so far we are lacking rules for predicting a basis of a given diagram .",
    "the power of the method , however , is that given a set of basis elements for one diagram , it can be used to find the solution for other diagrams .",
    "often , though , one has to ` generalize ' already known ( harmonic ) sums in a basis . in sect .",
    "4 we explain how to do this .",
    "in particular it will be shown that many 2-point and 3-point functions have similar bases and thus solving some 2-point integrals ( which are simpler ) we can find solutions for 3-point integrals . as an illustration consider the diagram shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath55 .",
    "its large mass expansion looks like @xmath56 with the @xmath57 s being rational numbers .",
    "it is obvious that one can search for a solution for each of the @xmath57 s independently .",
    "again we use the same set of functions ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) as above but now with different transcendentality level(s ) .",
    "the system of equations has a solution only if we add the factor @xmath60 which can be seen easily by inspection of the series . at the end",
    "we arrive at @xmath61 where as above we take all harmonic sums ( @xmath62 ) with the argument @xmath42 , which is omitted .",
    "+ the similarity of ( [ res1 ] ) and ( [ res2 ] ) is spectacular .",
    "there are two comments in order .",
    "+ at first we point out that in ( [ res2 ] ) the part without @xmath63 has basis elements @xmath64 obeying @xmath65 ( i.e. it has a basis with tl@xmath66 )",
    ". terms proportional to @xmath63 are of 3rd level while those proportional to @xmath67 of the 2nd .",
    "one can say that @xmath63 itself is of 1st level and each @xmath68 reduces the level of basis elements by @xmath15 units .",
    "this is the general behaviour for all diagrams we consider .",
    "the same rule applies to uv and ir poles @xmath69 if they are present in a diagram i.e. each @xmath70 reduces the level of basis elements by @xmath15 units .    secondly we wish to underline the presence of the factor @xmath60 . strictly speaking the basis",
    "now is not @xmath64 any more but rather @xmath71 . in principle",
    "one can expect that a mixture of both bases occurs and this is indeed the case for some diagrams .",
    "moreover , the @xmath72 may stand not only in front of @xmath73 but also inside the harmonic summation .",
    "thus we are led to the alternating harmonic sums @xmath74 .",
    "it will turn out that the results obtained above indicate already a general property , i.e. in 2-loops all the selfenergy functions have tl=3 and all vertices have tl=4 ( at least for the diagrams under consideration ) .",
    "it was mentioned above that we can not directly predict the basis of a diagram",
    ". therefore we experiment with basis elements of diagrams calculated before to match the expansion coefficients of other ones .",
    "another extremely useful trick is that we first establish the structure of the lowest level in a diagram ( i.e. the structure of the coefficients of the highest pole in @xmath75 or the highest power of @xmath63 ) and then try to reconstruct terms of higher level .",
    "if , say , the @xmath76 coefficients are expressed symbolically in terms of basis elements @xmath77 with tl=@xmath15 then the @xmath78 part is expressed in terms of some @xmath79 etc .",
    "therefore we need rules of generalization , i.e. to find higher level elements from lower level ones .",
    "these are discussed in this section .",
    "we start from the following observation .",
    "let @xmath80 be a @xmath81-dimensional feynman integral ( properly normalized to be dimensionless ) depending on @xmath13 .",
    "it can be formally written as multiple series of the hypergeometric type @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the euler @xmath83-function . here",
    "the symbols @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 stand for some linear combinations of the summation indices @xmath87 and the space - time dimension @xmath10 .",
    "the form ( [ feydia ] ) , though rather obvious by itself , can be deduced e.g. from the feynman parameter representation or @xmath88-representation . from this point of view",
    ", to evaluate diagram @xmath80 means to bring multiple sums in ( [ feydia ] ) to some known hypergeometric form of series or at least to remove as many summations as possible .",
    "usually , however , one is interested in the expansion of a diagram around @xmath89 . on expansion , ( [ feydia ] )",
    "develops some singularities in the @xmath32-plane and possible poles @xmath69 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath83-functions produces @xmath90-functions or equivalently @xmath41-sums .",
    "namely for @xmath91 integer @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "this shows that harmonic sums naturally play a special role in our subject .",
    "terms of lowest order are obtained by replacing the exponent in ( [ gamma ] ) by unity and ( [ feydia ] ) becomes a multiple sum of factorials .",
    "then the coefficient of @xmath94 is a finite sum over factorials .",
    "terms of higher level are obtained by expanding the exponent in ( [ gamma ] ) in @xmath75 , which produces @xmath41-functions in ( [ feydia ] ) .",
    "this suggests the following recipe of generalization : if @xmath77 is found to be a multiple ( finite ) sum @xmath95 , then higher level objects are obtained either by multiplying @xmath77 by @xmath41-functions or by inserting @xmath41-functions under the summation sign of @xmath77 to give @xmath96 where the arguments of @xmath97 are some linear combinations of summation indices .",
    "the same applies of course to the function @xmath73 itself giving @xmath98 etc .    from ( [ ss ] )",
    "it is seen that any @xmath77 produces in general many functions @xmath99 and higher ones . in the case of a multiple summation",
    "the number of possible combinations of @xmath100 may get too large and this general rule is getting rather formal than practical . however , in practice we always met the situation that @xmath101 is a simple ( one - fold ) sum .",
    "then , inserting @xmath102 and @xmath103 or equivalently @xmath102 and @xmath104 , ( [ ss ] ) becomes @xmath105 the choice ( [ ss1 ] ) is justified _ a posteriory_.    this prescription ,",
    "however , must be modified if a diagram possesses @xmath7-cuts ( with a threshold at @xmath106 ) .",
    "such diagrams produce in the sum ( [ feydia ] ) functions like @xmath107 and according to ( [ gamma ] ) @xmath108 . in such cases , along with @xmath102 ,",
    "we insert also @xmath108 .    in conclusion of this section",
    "we want to stress that the recipes formulated above do not necessarily work in every case for any diagram .",
    "but in many cases they do .",
    "a possible reason of a failure of the prescription ( [ ss ] ) may be e.g. the following : some new basis element begins to contribute only , say , at the order @xmath69 while at the order @xmath109 it happens to drop out .",
    "in such cases it will be missed in the analysis and one has to use other more powerful and direct methods of determination of low level terms .",
    "we now establish the structure of the lowest level for the set of diagrams having both @xmath6- and @xmath7-cuts . while for diagrams with only @xmath6-cuts the complete basis consists of elements @xmath111 and their generalization due to ( [ ss1 ] ) , in the presence of @xmath7-cuts the basis changes drastically . in this case the behaviour of the coefficients is governed by a new class of elements which we call @xmath110 .",
    "the generic structure of the lowest level is @xmath112 and higher level functions are obtained following the rules of the previous section .",
    "the @xmath110-structure can be deduced from different diagrams with @xmath7-cuts but most easily we find it from the nonplanar graph shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath113 . namely this diagram has a double collinear pole and we can easily perform both integrations in calculating the @xmath109 contribution .",
    "consider at first the massless lines 3 and 5 ( see ( [ norm ] ) for the normalization ) @xmath114 where @xmath115 stands for the rest of the diagram .",
    "introducing the feynman parameter @xmath116 this can be written as @xmath117 where we have used @xmath118 .",
    "this integral diverges in 4-dimensions when @xmath119 , i.e. there is a collinear divergence . for the calculation of the most singular term in @xmath75 one can effectively replace @xmath120 and the same replacement applies to the pair of lines 4 and 6 and integration @xmath121",
    ". therefore @xmath122 [ ( k_2-k_1-p_2)^2 - m^2 ] } .\\ ] ]    integrating out @xmath123 with the help of the @xmath124-functions and using @xmath125 , @xmath126 , we arrive at ( @xmath13 ) @xmath127    if we assign to the factor @xmath128 the 0th level , then the expression on the r.h.s of ( [ polepart ] ) has the correct 2nd level as it should be for the double pole part of a vertex function . using the results of sect .",
    "4 we obtain functions of higher levels @xmath129 etc .",
    "( see appendix a ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated above that the most important point in our approach to set up a taylor series for the diagrams under consideration is to find the proper basis elements . in the last section",
    "we have seen a special calculation to find one more basis element .",
    "there is no general way of how to find further such elements but another effective approach is that of the differential equation method ( dem ) @xcite .",
    "it was used in @xcite to find the expansion of diagrams @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the notation of fig.3 .",
    "therefore we give in this section a short review of the dem and demonstrate the finding of another basis element by calculating the two - point diagram @xmath132 of fig .",
    "2 .    the dem allows one to calculate massive diagrams by reducing them to others having an essentially simpler structure .",
    "more precisely , one writes a linear differential equation ( w.r.t .",
    "masses ) for the diagram under consideration .",
    "the inhomogeneous term of the equation is a sum of diagrams with smaller number of lines .",
    "these in turn can be reduced via another differential equation to even simpler diagrams and so on . solving the so obtained equations",
    "iteratively one gets for the initial diagram an @xmath133-fold integral representation which is in general simpler than the usual parametric or dispersion integrals .",
    "often some of the integrations can be performed analytically .    for completeness",
    "we give some formulae that will be useful in the futher discussion .",
    "we introduce the following graphical representation for the propagators + @xmath134    ( 30,10)(5,4 ) ( 0,5)(30,5)2 ( 0,5)1 ( 30,5)1 ( 15,7)[b]@xmath135    @xmath136    ( 30,10)(5,4 ) ( 0,5)(30,5 ) ( 0,5)1 ( 30,5)1 ( 15,7)[b]@xmath135 ( 15,3)[t]@xmath137    \\(19 ) +   + @xmath88 and @xmath6 are called the index and mass of this line .",
