    "the most important event in the formation and evolution of most close interacting binaries is the so - called common envelope ( ce ) event , during which the components of a binary system are engulfed by a common gaseous envelope , and the resulting interaction dramatically shrinks their orbit @xcite . depending on the envelope structure and companion masses , the envelope is ejected to leave behind a close binary , or the two stars merge . dividing the parameter space into binaries that survive ce and those that do not , and",
    "determining the final separation for the former , is critical for calculating formation rates of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , @xmath2-ray bursts , as well as for lisa and ligo events @xcite .    in the standard treatment of ce outcomes , the final separation of the binary",
    "is determined via `` energy formalism '' @xcite , in which the binding energy of the ( shunned ) envelope is equated to the decrease in the orbital energy @xmath3 :    @xmath4    here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the initial and final binary separations , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the initial star masses and @xmath9 is the final mass of the star that lost its envelope .",
    "@xmath10 is assumed to be the energy expense needed to remove the envelope to infinity and is commonly adopted to be the sum of the potential energy of the envelope and its internal energy . to characterise the donor envelope central concentration and simplify calculations , specifically for population synthesis ,",
    "a parameter @xmath11 was introduced :    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the mass of the removed giant envelope and @xmath14 is the radius of the giant star at the onset of ce , @xmath15 is the specific internal energy and @xmath16 is the ( gravitational ) force potential ( or specific potential energy ) .",
    "@xmath17 can be found directly from stellar structure for any accepted core mass .",
    "another parameter , @xmath18 , is introduced as a measure of the energy transfer efficiency from the orbital energy into envelope expansion , and the balance of energy is written as    @xmath19    many authors choose to accept @xmath20 , since for many ( at least low - mass ) stars @xmath21 , as can be found from detailed stellar structure , and @xmath18 is bounded above by 1 .    the simplicity of the standard prescription resulted in its popular use in the binary population synthesis calculations .",
    "however , once accurate values of @xmath11 from stellar structure calculations were determined , this approach has shown inconsistencies with the observations , especially large for the formation of black hole lmxbs : in massive giants @xmath22 @xcite , and it has been shown that with @xmath23 only an intermediate - mass companion could avoid a merger ; this challenges the formation of a low - mass x - ray binary with a low - mass companion in general @xcite .    here ,",
    "we revise the energy requirements necessary to force a common envelope to disperse and discuss its possible application for lmxbs formation .",
    "while the definition of the gravitational binding energy is unequivocal , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there exists no authoritative source defining what expression should be used as the binding energy of a gaseous sphere in the sense of   1 .",
    "to clarify , in treating the common envelope problem we are interested in the additional energy to be deposited in the envelope in order to disperse material to infinity .",
    "the ` industry standard ' at the moment is to use the total of the gravitational @xmath24 and the gas thermal @xmath25 energies , which , as we shall argue in this section , is not correct .    as an illustrative limiting case ,",
    "consider a star with the positive total energy @xmath26 to begin with , which is _ `` kinetically stable '' _ ; i.e. an energy barrier has to be overcome between the bound and unbound states @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in such cases , the additional energy @xmath27 required to unbind the star is the magnitude of the energy barrier , not the ( unphysical ) @xmath28 .",
    "the secular stability of a star against small adiabatic perturbations is not defined by the sign of the total energy @xmath29 , but rather by the variational conditions : an equilibrium state is an extremum of the total energy @xmath30 ; and secularly stable configurations are then found at local minima : @xmath31 . @xcite .",
    "if the first adiabatic exponent @xmath32 is approximately a constant throughout the star , the secular stability criterion reduces to the condition @xcite    @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the pressure and @xmath35 is the density .    for a one - zone model of a stellar envelope , a linearized version of the above condition , the baker s model @xcite gives a similar criterion for the volume - averaged adiabatic exponent @xmath36 in the envelope    on the other hand , the virial theorem , applied to the _ entire _ star , gives us the condition for the total energy @xmath37 in the case of constant third adiabatic exponent @xmath38 , as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is is the temperature .",
    "we note that this simple form depends crucially on newton s third law applied to every pair of particles inside the star , and thus needs to be substantially modified if we only consider the envelope .",
    "we reiterate the importance of distinguishing these conditions : instability does not have to occur in a state with positive total energy , and @xmath32 does not have to coincide with @xmath38 ; they are related as @xmath41 in particular , the ionization zones , where @xmath42 and can become as low as 0.1 , have local value of @xmath43 while @xmath44 .",
    "it is unfortunately non - trivial to find the volume - averaged @xmath32 in the giant envelope after depositing some heat in it .",
    "however , it is clear that the criterion of the total energy in the envelope to be @xmath45 is not applicable for the envelope stability , nor is it a sufficient condition for the envelope to be dispersed to infinity .",
    "we will consider instead the stability of a stellar envelope towards creating outflows .",
    "since we are interested in the energy _ requirements _ , it is natural to consider a lower bound on @xmath27 : all orbital energy is converted into heat , and the velocity of ejecta at infinity is zero .",
    "how precise these bounds are is not of great concern here and is a separate problem on its own , although we expect them to be reasonably close : the time scale for viscous friction between differentially rotating regions can exceed the spiral - in time , but most angular momentum is lost in the outer envelope while most of the energy is released at closer orbits , so the overall effect of angular momentum conservation can at least be constructed to be small .    as any other thermodynamical system undergoing a steady process",
    ", the material in a star obeys the first law of thermodynamics , which states that the change of the internal energy comes not only from the heat transferred into system , but also from the work done by the system : @xmath46 applying this equation for each mass shell in the envelope , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , gives the energy conservation equation in lagrangian coordinates as    @xmath47    here @xmath48 is the velocity .",
    "the initial condition is that at the start the mass shells in the envelope are not moving , but every shell in the envelope received some heat , in this case deposited from the companion s orbital contraction .",
    "the heat has some arbitrary distribution @xmath49 in the envelope ( @xmath50 is per mass unit ) , such that    @xmath51    a given lagrangian shell , once it has been heated and started expansion , will have reached the point of no return in its expansion when its @xmath52 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath53    in this form , the equation can be also recognized as version of the bernoulli equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 , for stability analysis purposes , is more important than the total energy : bipolitropic stellar model that has @xmath55 in its envelope but positive total energy is metastable as a whole , even though the run - away to infinity is energetically allowable ; but a star with @xmath52 in its envelope will be always quasi - steadily outflowing @xcite .",
    "it also has been noted that it is a general feature of low - mass giants during double shell burning to establish @xmath52 in larger and large parts of their envelopes as they evolve ( with he shell providing large energy inflow to the envelope with each he - shell flash ) , and could possibly being responsible for envelope outflows and/or ejections with planetary nebula formation @xcite .    in line with results of past stability analyses of when a star starts an outflow ( * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) , we suggest that once a _ part _ of the common envelope has obtained positive @xmath54 , it will start outflowing , notwithstanding the sign of the envelope s total energy . a stronger criterion would be to require the _ entire _ envelope to have positive @xmath54 . under assumption of the minimum energy requirement ( velocity of gas at infinity is zero ) ,",
    "we can write the energy conservation for a whole envelope as    @xmath56    the timescale for start such quasi - steady surface outflows is one on which the envelope redistributes the dumped heat , i.e. the thermal timescale of the envelope - recall our earlier note about most energy being deposited in lower orbits .",
    "this time is about few hundred years ( e.g , it is about 1000 years for a @xmath57 , see fig.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "this makes the appearance of mass outflows _ natural _ during the self - regulating spiral - in stage ; such a stage could last for up to a thousand years @xcite ; but they likely will not take place if the common envelope event occurs on the dynamical time , as is the case e.g. , in the case of a physical collision , or if the swallowed companion is too small to expand the giant envelope and establish a self - regulated slow spiral - in phase .    note , that    * due to the presence of a non - negative term @xmath1 , this condition occurs before the envelope s total energy become positive ; * the master equation ( [ allam ] ) of the  @xmath11-formalism  is a version of eq.([bern ] ) where all the velocities , as well as the work @xmath1 are simply neglected .",
    "the term @xmath1 is of the order of magnitude of @xmath15 ; for example , for an ideal gas , with no radiation pressure and ionization taken into account , @xmath58 .",
    "the quantity @xmath59 is generally known as _",
    "enthalpy_.    in line with the classical ` @xmath11-formalism ' and for ease of comparison ,",
    "we introduce :    @xmath60     and @xmath61 inside @xmath62 giant .",
    "the `` boiling pot '' zone has excess energy .",
    "energy is the specific energy in erg per g. [ bpz ] ]    following @xcite in considering the detailed stellar models of giants with respect to their @xmath54 , we also note that normal single giants have a \" boiling pot  zone ( bpz ) , where @xmath63 due to high value of @xmath1 ( fig .  [ bpz ] ) .",
    "once sufficient amount of the `` lid ''  the star matter above this zone is removed , all material with positive @xmath54 could freely stream away without the need to convert any additional mechanical energy .",
    "the outer boundary of the bpz almost does not change during the giant stage , and the inner boundary does not change once the convective envelope is established ( e.g. , in case of low - mass red giants , rgs ) .",
    "the bottom of the bpz roughly ( but not always exactly ) coincides with the bottom of the outer convective zone .",
    "illustratively , the mass contained in this zone is : @xmath64 for @xmath65 rg , up to @xmath66 for a @xmath67 giant evolved without wind mass loss , and about 3 times less for a @xmath67 giant evolved with mass loss .",
    "we anticipate that the presence of the boiling pot zone could be a key to understand why rgs are expanding when losing their mass .",
    "just like @xmath11 , @xmath70 can be found from detailed stellar calculations . for the purpose of this comparison",
    ", we adopt the definition of the core mass for both cases as in @xcite : the post - ce core is the point with maximum compression @xmath1 inside the hydrogen burning shell , @xmath71 .",
    "such a core will not re - expand after the envelope loss , and it was shown that in most of the cases it is energetically beneficial to remove the envelope down to exactly @xmath71 .    in table  1 we show the results for giants of different masses .",
    "we used the set of stellar models described in @xcite .",
    "we find that in most giants the ratios of @xmath72 are from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , where the largest ratios , for a giant of the same mass , are for an earlier giant .",
    "the final separations allowed by the enthalpy - consideration are then larger by the same few times .    the minimal companion mass  in the sense that no possible stripped core value exists such that a binary would not merge ",
    "changes by several times as well ( table  1 ) . specifically , we want to point out the difference between the enthalpy consideration and standard prescription for massive giants : while @xmath0-formalism would predict the minimum surviving companion mass of about several @xmath75 , in line with the problem raised by @xcite , the enthalpy - formalism allows for an low - mass companion to survive and form in a future a black hole lmxb .",

    "in this _ letter _ we considered the termination of a common envelope event at the moment it establishes a quasi - stationary mass outflow that would reach a point of no return .",
    "such outflow develops during the slow self - regulating spiral - in phase of the common envelope event .",
    "we showed that if the common envelope is escaping the binary in this way , neglecting the @xmath76 term in the standard @xmath0 energy conservation prescription is too gross .",
    "if the enthalpy rather than internal energy is calculated in the energy balance , it makes a crucial difference in giants .    while we anticipate that the estimate of a proper energy requirement is paramount for the formation rates of all kinds of post - ce binaries , we especially emphasize the importance of this effect in the case of ce with a massive giant .",
    "when the standard energy formalism predicts that only a several solar mass donor could survive ce , and so the formation of a low - mass x - ray binary with a black hole accretor is forbidden unless @xmath18 exceeds 1 , the enthalpy - consideration naturally allows for a low - mass companion survival .",
