    "in central high - energy heavy - ion collisions , jets are produced in nucleon - nucleon collisions and they interact with the dense matter produced in the interacting region . depending on the degree of jet attenuation and energy loss ,",
    "jets of high @xmath0 particles can be classified as near - side jets or away - side jets in the opposite direction .",
    "a near - side jet is characterized by the presence of associated particles within a narrow cone along the trigger direction which correspond to jet remnants of the high @xmath0 jet .",
    "they retain the the jet remnant characteristics as those in @xmath1 and peripheral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the near - side jet occurs when the high @xmath0 trigger emerges near the surface of the produced parton medium . in these experiments ,",
    "one measures the azimuthal angle @xmath2 and the pseudorapidity angle @xmath3 of the jet and its associated particles , from which one obtains the corresponding relative differences @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the probability distribution in @xmath6 was found to be in the form of a ridge at @xmath7 running along the @xmath8 direction , in addition to the narrow cone of the jet component at @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    since the observation of the ridge associated with the near - side jet by the star collaboration @xcite ,",
    "similar ridge phenomena were observed by the phobos @xcite and phenix collaborations @xcite .",
    "although many theoretical models have been put forth to explain the ridge phenomenon @xcite , few provide direct comparisons with the extensive set of experimental data . comparisons with experimental data over an extended region of the associated particle phase space of @xmath0 , @xmath11 , and @xmath8 have been carried out in the momentum kick model @xcite . by successfully explaining the experimental data , the momentum kick model has extracted a wealth of valuable information on the state of the dense matter formed at the early stage of the collision process .",
    "in the momentum kick model , particles in the ridge component are described as medium partons scattered ( kicked ) by the jet passing through the medium .",
    "such a conclusion comes from the following considerations .",
    "it is observed that ( i ) the ridge yield increases with the number of participants , ( ii ) the ridge yield is nearly independent of the trigger jet properties , ( iii ) the baryon to meson ratio of the ridge particles is more similar to those of the bulk matter of the medium than those of the jet , and ( iv ) the slope parameter of the transverse momentum distribution of ridge particles is intermediate between those of the jet and the bulk matter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these features suggest that the ridge particles are medium partons , at an earlier stage of the medium evolution during the passage of the jet .",
    "the azimuthal correlation of the ridge particle with the jet suggests that the associated ridge particle and the trigger jet are related by a collision .    as a result of the jet - parton collision ,",
    "a medium parton received a momentum kick @xmath12 from the jet .",
    "the momentum distribution of a ridge parton at momentum @xmath13 is then the momentum distribution of the parton before the jet - parton collision at the shifted initial momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the addition of the momentum kick along the jet direction to the collided medium parton gives rise to the peak in @xmath15 , and the extended pseudorapidity distribution of the associated particles on the ridge arises from the initial parton pseudorapidity distribution before the jet - parton collision .",
    "the momentum distribution of associated particles in the ` jet component ' at @xmath11=0 and @xmath8@xmath160 in a nucleus - nucleus collision can be assumed to be an attenuated distribution of associated particles in a @xmath1 collision , as expected for production in an interacting medium near the surface .",
    "therefore , the total observed yield of associated particles per trigger in a+a collisions consists of the sum of the jet and ridge components , @xmath17_{\\rm total}^{\\rm aa }    \\nonumber\\\\ & & =   \\left [ f_j   \\frac { dn_{\\rm jet}^{pp } } { p_t dp_t\\ , d\\delta \\eta\\ , d\\delta \\phi } \\right ] _ { \\rm jet}^{\\rm aa } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ f_r    \\frac { 2}{3 }   \\langle n_k \\rangle \\frac { df } { p_t dp_t\\ , d\\delta \\eta\\ , d\\delta \\phi } \\right ] _ { \\rm ridge}^{\\rm aa }    \\!\\!\\!\\!,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the distribution of associated particles in a @xmath1 collision , @xmath19 is the average number of kicked partons per jet , and @xmath20 is the normalized initial parton momentum distribution before the jet - parton collisions , evaluated at the shifted initial momentum @xmath21 .",
    "here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the survival factors for the associated particles , as they continue to pass through the medium after production .",
    "the experimental data calls for an early parton momentum distribution that has a thermal - like transverse momentum distribution , modified for the low-@xmath0 region , and a rapidity distribution that retains the flatness at mid - rapidity but also respects the kinematic boundaries at large rapidities and large @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , we parametrize the normalized initial parton momentum distribution as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a normalization constant , @xmath26 is the light - cone variable @xmath27 @xmath28 is the fall - off parameter that specifies the rate of decrease of the rapidity distribution , @xmath29 is the beam parton rapidity , and @xmath30 is the mass of the beam parton .",

    "with the help of the momentum kick model , the comparison with experimental data furnished the following pieces of valuable information :    1 .",
    "the extracted early parton momentum distribution has a thermal - like transverse momentum distribution and a rapidity plateau structure , as represented by the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 and shown in fig .",
    "the rapidity plateau extends to large rapidities and gives rise to the flat distribution of the associated particles as observed by the phobos collaboration .",
    "it is narrower than the @xmath1 rapidity plateau but wider than the au - au gaussian structure @xcite , and places the early partons to be at an intermediate stage of the parton rapidity evolution .",
    "the inverse slope @xmath43 of the early parton transverse momentum distribution is intermediate between those for the @xmath1 jet @xmath44 and @xmath45 for central au - au collisions @xcite .",
    "this again indicates the intermediate nature of the early partons in the evolution of the parton momentum distribution .",
    "3 .   the longitudinal momentum transfer by the jet onto the medium parton in a collision is @xmath46=0.8 - 1.0 gev .",
    "such a longitudinal momentum transfer corresponds to a @xmath47 value of about 0.26 gev@xmath48 , which places the jet - parton collision within the realm of non - perturbative parton - parton scattering , as in the non - perturbative scattering with the exchange of a pomeron .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] 4 .   for the most central au - au collision ,",
    "the average number @xmath51 of medium partons kicked by the jet on the near - side , multiplied by the survival factor @xmath23 is @xmath52 .",
    "the trend of the decrease of the number of kicked medium partons and the degree of jet quenching as a function of centrality are consistent with this simple picture of the momentum kick model @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the associated particle experimental data reveal that particles associated with a near - side jet arise from two different components .",
    "the ridge component can be interpreted as arising from the medium partons which suffer an elastic scattering from the jet passing through the dense matter .",
    "the jet component can be described as an attenuated distribution from a @xmath1 collision .",
    "such a picture provides a good description of the experimental associated particle data from the star , phobos , and phenix collaborations .",
    "the momentum kick model analysis allows us to extract a wealth of valuable information on the states of the matter formed at the early stage of the collision process .",
    "we find that the momentum distribution of the early partons at the moments of jet - parton collisions has a rapidity plateau structure and a thermal - like transverse momentum distribution .",
    "rapidity plateau structures appear in many multi - particle production processes .",
    "theoretically , a rapidity plateau is expected in qed2 fragmentation in a flux tube , which mimics particle production in qcd as a @xmath53 and a @xmath54 pull away from each other at high energies @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a rapidity plateau has been observed in high energy @xmath55@xmath56 annihilations , and @xmath1 collisions @xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility of a rapidity plateau for the ridge particles should not come as a surprise . however , the fact that a parton of large absolute rapidity can occur together with a jet of central rapidities , as revealed by the phobos data and the momentum kick model analysis , poses an interesting conceptual question . for those medium partons with large magnitude of the longitudinal momentum to collide with the jet",
    "so as to become an associated ridge particle in the phobos experiment , the partons must be present in the longitudinal neighborhood of the jet at the moments of the jet - medium collision , at an early stage of the nucleus - nucleus collision .    in many classical descriptions of particle production processes such as the lund model , a particle with a large absolute rapidity",
    "is associated with a large separation from the longitudinal origin at a later time .",
    "jet parton and medium parton collisions take place at an early stage .",
    "partons with large rapidities may not be produced for the jet to collide .",
    "it is important to point out that there are important quantum effects @xcite that are beyond the realm of such classical considerations .",
    "the space - time dynamics of produced particles in string fragmentation can be obtained by evaluating the wigner function of the produced particles when a strongly - coupled fermion separates from an antifermion at high energies in qed2 .",
    "we find that produced particles with different momenta in different regions of the rapidity plateau are present at the moment when the overlapping fermion - antifermion pair begin to separate @xcite , in contrast to the classical description of particle production .",
    "thus , the momentum kick model is consistent with other knowledge of the interaction processes and supports the picture of color flux tube production of the medium partons at an early stages , as in schwinger s non - perturbative qed2 string fragmentation ."
