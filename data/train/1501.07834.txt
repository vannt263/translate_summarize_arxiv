    "to understand the nature and structure of the particles found in the experiments , and to search for new hadronic states , are the main issues in nowadays particle physics which has been accepted generally that quarks are the basic building blocks of matter . within the gell - mann - zweig quark model @xcite for the normal hadron states ,",
    "mesons are made of a quark - antiquark pair , @xmath19 , and baryons made of three quark components , @xmath20 . on the other hand , there are some states found in the experiments , such as the mesons , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the baryons , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with structure and properties difficult to explain by the normal quark model .",
    "these states might therefore be called `` exotic '' states ( recent experimental discussions are given in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . to understand the structure and properties of these exotic states in the strong interaction , we need to exploit other theories or approaches , for example chiral perturbative theory @xcite , effective field theory @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , qcd sum rule @xcite , dyson - schwinger equations @xcite , chiral quark model @xcite , chiral unitary approach ( chua ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "but , some discovered particles , such as the @xmath28 ( also called @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , look like having a more complicated structure and could come from multi - body hadron interaction , which is a subject in hadron physics drawing much attention for a long time @xcite . with this motivation , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite develops the chua for the three - body interaction , which combines the three - body faddeev equations with on shell approximation of the chua and has reported several @xmath33-wave @xmath34 resonances qualifying as two mesons - one baryon molecular states . in ref .",
    "@xcite this combination of faddeev equations and chiral dynamics in the @xmath35 system obtains consistent results with qcd sum rules .",
    "when in some cases there are resonances ( or bound states ) appearing in the two - body subsystem of the three - body interaction , ref .",
    "@xcite takes the fixed center approximation ( fca ) @xcite to the faddeev equations , where several multi-@xmath36 states are dynamically produced , and the resonances @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are theoretically found as basically molecules of an increasing number of @xmath36 particles with parallel spins .",
    "analogously , the resonances @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and a new @xmath46 are produced in the @xmath47-multi-@xmath1 systems and could be explained as molecules with the components of an increasing number of @xmath36 and one @xmath48 meson in ref . @xcite . also in ref .",
    "@xcite , charmed resonances @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are predicted in the @xmath53-multi-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "note that , recently a resonance structure is found by lhcb at about @xmath54 with @xmath55 in the @xmath56 mass distribution , which is close to the mass of @xmath49 state predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath57 . in the present work",
    "we investigate the @xmath0-multi-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "taking fca to the faddeev equations , the @xmath58 interaction studied in refs .",
    "@xcite has proved accuracy when dealing with bound states , and obtains consistent results with the full faddeev equations evaluation without taking fca @xcite , or a variational calculation with a nonrelativistic three - body potential model @xcite , which is also confirmed by the recent results with new faddeev calculations in refs .",
    "even though there is a different results claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite on the @xmath58 system , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite clarified the different kinematical between them using two different approaches in their investigations , the watson approach and the truncated faddeev approach .",
    "a further study of the @xmath58 system is done in the recent work of @xcite , which has investigated the @xmath59 scattering length with the first - order recoil correction using the non - relativistic effective field theory approach .",
    "a narrow quasibound state of @xmath60 in the @xmath61 system is predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite by both fca to faddeev equations calculation and the variational method approach with the effective one - channel hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we use the fca to the faddeev equations to investigate the @xmath0-multi-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "there are some possible @xmath0 excited states with strangeness @xmath62 and aligned with increasing spin number in the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , such as @xmath63 or @xmath64 or @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 or @xmath68 or @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "some of these states still need more confirmation in the future experiments .",
    "this is the motivation of the present work , to understand their structure and properties theoretically . applying the fca to the faddeev equations",
    ", there should be resonances or bound states in the two - body subsystem .",
    "for the @xmath0-multi-@xmath1 systems , the basic two - body subsystems are the @xmath4 and @xmath72 interactions . based on the local hidden gauge",
    "lagrangians @xcite , the two - body @xmath73 interaction is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with the coupled channel approach of chua and found that a @xmath73 quasibound state or molecule could be associated to the @xmath2 found in the pdg @xcite . with the on - shell bethe - salpeter equation of chua , and a chiral lagrangian ,",
    "the two - body @xmath72 interaction is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and dynamically produced the @xmath74 resonance .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath74 state is reinvestigated with detail using chua to analyse the experimental data in the later work of ref . @xcite .",
    "thus , the resonances @xmath2 in the @xmath73 interaction and @xmath74 in the @xmath72 interaction are the needed clusters in the formalism of the present work .    in the next section",
    ", we will first present the formalism of the fca to the faddeev equations . then , in the following section , the resonances @xmath2 and @xmath74 are reproduced dynamically with the chua in the @xmath73 interaction and the @xmath72 interaction respectively .",
    "our investigation results are shown in section [ secres ] .",
    "finally , we finish with conclusions .",
    "for the three - body interaction as faddeev suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering amplitude of @xmath75-matrix can be written as a sum of three partitions , @xmath76 where partition amplitude @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) includes all the possible interactions contributing to the three - body @xmath75-matrix with the particle @xmath81 being a spectator in the last interaction .",
    "but , if there are resonances ( or bound states ) as clusters appearing in the two - body subsystem interaction , for example the cluster coming from @xmath82 , thus , we can assume that a cluster is formed by the two particles ( named as particle 1 , 2 ) and is not much modified by the interaction of a third particle ( particle 3 ) with this cluster .",
    "therefore , assuming the cluster as the fixed center of the three - body system , we can take the fca @xcite to the faddeev equations .",
    "then , the @xmath82 partition amplitude contributes to the cluster for the fca , and the fca multiple scattering of the third particle with the components of the cluster is taken into account .",
    "thus , we can rewrite the faddeev equations of eq .",
    "easily ( which is also developed by the chua ) , @xmath83 where @xmath75 is the total three - body scattering amplitude , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fca ] .        from this figure",
    ", we can see that the faddeev equations under the fca are first a pair of particles ( 1 and 2 ) forming a cluster , and then particle 3 interacts with the components of the cluster , undergoing all possible multiple scattering with those components .",
    "thus , the two partition amplitudes @xmath84 and @xmath85 sum all diagrams of the series of fig .",
    "[ fig : fca ] which begin with the interaction of particle 3 with particle 1 of the cluster ( @xmath84 ) , or with the particle 2 ( @xmath85 ) . finally , the scattering amplitude @xmath75 is the total three - body interaction amplitude that we look for .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath86 and @xmath87 represent the unitary scattering amplitudes with coupled channels for the interactions of particle 3 with particle 1 and 2 , respectively , which should be taken into account the isospin structure of the subsystem and discussed in details for different cases in section [ secres ] . besides , @xmath88 is the propagator of particle 3 between the components of the two - body subsystem , given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 , the energy carried by particle 3 in the rest frame of the three particle system , is given by @xmath91 with @xmath92 the mass of the third particle and @xmath93 the mass of the cluster , and @xmath94 is the form factor of the cluster of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "the form factor of the cluster should be consistently with the theory used to generate the cluster .",
    "this requires to evaluate the wave functions in the chua reproduced the cluster , which has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath33-wave bound states , @xmath33-wave resonant states and states with arbitrary angular momentum , respectively .",
    "since in the present cases , the generated clusters are @xmath33-wave bound states , we only need the expression of the form factors for the @xmath33-wave bound states , given by @xcite , @xmath95 where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 the mass ) are the energies of the particles 1 , 2 .",
    "we use a cut off @xmath99 to regularize the integrals of eqs . and ( also for eq . , discussed in section [ secres ] ) , which is the same as the one used in the loop function of the two - body interaction to reproduce the cluster @xcite .",
    "thus , no free parameters are involved .",
    "note that , in the present work , we care about the dynamics close to the threshold and thus the method of cutoff is acceptable .",
    "taking the normalization of the field theory @xcite which has different weight factors for the particle fields , we must take into account how these factors appear in the single scattering and double scattering and in the total amplitude @xcite .",
    "in all the present cases , the cluster ( also particles 1 and 2 ) is a meson and the scattering particle ( the third particle ) too , which are only related to meson fields .",
    "thus , following ref .",
    "@xcite we write the @xmath33 matrix of single scattering , fig . [",
    "fig : fca ] ( a ) , @xmath100 where , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) are the momentum of initial , final scattering particle ( @xmath103 for the cluster ) , @xmath104 are the energies of the initial , final particles , @xmath105 is the volume of the box where the states are normalized to unity and the subscripts 1 , 2 refer to scattering with particle 1 or 2 of the cluster .",
    "next , the double scattering diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : fca ] ( b ) , is given by , @xmath106 where @xmath94 is the cluster form factor that we have discussed above , seen in eq . .",
    "similarly , the full @xmath33 matrix for scattering of particle 3 with the cluster can be written as , @xmath107 now , we can see that for the unitary amplitudes corresponding to single - scattering contribution , one must take into account the isospin structure of the cluster and write the @xmath86 and @xmath87 amplitudes in terms of the isospin amplitudes of the ( 3,1 ) and ( 3,2 ) systems . in view of the different normalization of these terms by comparing eqs .",
    ", , and , we can introduce suitable factors in the elementary amplitudes , @xmath108 where we have taken the approximations , @xmath109 .",
    "but , when the cluster , the particles 1 and 2 , one of them is a baryon , the factors in eqs . and",
    ", @xmath110 and @xmath111 should be replaced by 1 for taking the baryonic field factor approximation @xmath112 .",
    "finally , we sum all the diagrams , obtained @xmath113 when @xmath114 in some cases , it can be simplified as , @xmath115 note that , the fca to faddeev equations are particularly suited to study system with the subsystem bound or even loose bound , as discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite , and have some limitation on the case when the cluster of the two particles in the subsystem is excited in the intermediate states ( more discussions seen in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of @xmath116 system ) .    from the @xmath33 matrix of single scattering , eqs .",

    "the relationship between them is given by @xcite , @xmath121",
    "using the faddeev equations under the fca , we first need bound states in the two - body subsystem as the cluster of the fixed center , and then let the third particle collide with the cluster and interact with the components of the forming cluster . as discussed in the introduction , for the subsystems of the @xmath0-multi-@xmath1 system , the two - body @xmath73 and @xmath5 interactions",
    "are studied in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",

    "<S> in the present work we use three - body interaction formalism to investigate the @xmath0-multi-@xmath1 interactions . first , we reproduced the resonances @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 two - body interactions respectively , as the clusters of the fixed center approximation . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study the three - body @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions with the fixed center approximation of the faddeev equations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we extrapolate the formalism to study the four - body , five - body and six - body systems , containing one @xmath0 meson and multi-@xmath1 mesons . in our research , without introducing any free parameters , we generate the @xmath8 state in the three - body interaction with the mass of @xmath9 and a width about @xmath10 , which are consistent with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a clear resonant structure in our results of the five - body interaction , with a mass @xmath11 and a width about @xmath12 or more , which is associated to the @xmath13 state , where we obtain consistent results with the experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we predict some new states in the other many body interactions , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( isospin @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 ( isospin @xmath18 ) , with uncertainties . </S>"
