    "indirect dark matter [ dm ] searches are based on the detection of secondary particles and radiation produced by the self - annihilation of dm particles ( bergstrm 2000 , bertone 2005a ) .",
    "although the predicted annihilation flux is typically affected by large astrophysical uncertainties , the detection of multiwavelenght photons , neutrinos or anti - matter from regions with high dm density would be of paramount importance for the identification of dm particles .",
    "in fact , accelerator searches of physics beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider , will not necessarily unveil the nature of dm , even if new particles are discovered , due to the difficulties associated with the reconstruction of the cosmological abundance of the newly discovered particles ( e.g. baltz 2006a , nojiri 2005 ) . at the same time",
    ", dm particles could have small enough couplings to nucleons , to lead to null searches in direct detection experiments ( see e.g. mu@xmath12 oz 2003 and references therein ) .    in the framework of indirect dm searches ,",
    "several strategies have thus been devised , in order to obtain _ conclusive _ evidence from astrophysical observations .",
    "for instance , one could search for peculiar features , such as lines or sharp cut - offs , in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "although for commonly studied dm candidates there are no tree level processes for direct annihilation into photons , loop - level processes to @xmath13 and @xmath14 may produce detectable lines at an energy equal to the dm particle mass ( see e.g. bergstrm & ullio 1997 , ullio & bergstrm 1998 , gounaris 2003 , bergstrm 2005a ) .",
    "other spectral features may help distinguishing the dm annihilation signal from ordinary astrophysical sources ( bergstrm 2005b , bergstrm 2005c ; see also the discussion in baltz 2006b ) .",
    "alternatively , one can search for annihilation radiation from regions characterized by large concentrations of dm , but very few baryons , such as dm substructures in the milky way [ mw hereafter ] halo , including dwarf galaxies ( baltz 2000 , tasitsiomi 2003 , pieri & branchini 2003 , evans 2003 , tyler 2002 , colafrancesco 2007 , bergstrm & hooper 2006 ) and dm mini - spikes around intermediate mass black holes ( bertone 2006 , bertone 2005b , horiuchi & ando 2006 , fornasa 2007 , brun 2007 ) .",
    "finally , dm annihilation features can be detected in the energy spectrum and angular distribution of the cosmic @xmath0-ray background ( bergstrm , edsj & ullio 2001 , ando & komatsu 2006 ) .    in the popular cold dm scenario ,",
    "gravitational instabilities lead to the formation of a wealth of virialized structures , the dm haloes , spanning a huge range of masses , from the largest clusters of galaxies of @xmath15 down to earth - size clumps of @xmath16 ( green 2004 , green 2005 ) . although the detectability of individual dm substructures , or `` clumps '' has been widely discussed in literature , the number of detectable clumps with a glast - like experiment , at @xmath17 in 1 year and for a wimp dm particle is highly uncertain , ranging from @xmath18 ( koushiappas 2004 ) to more than 50 ( baltz 2006b ) for large mass haloes , while for microhaloes ( i.e. clumps with a mass as small as @xmath19 ) the predictions range from no detectable objects ( pieri 2005 ) to a large number of detectable objects , with a fraction of them exhibiting a large proper motion ( koushiappas 2006 ) .",
    "the apparent inconsistency of the results published so far , is actually due to the different assumptions that different groups adopt for the physical quantities that regulate the number and the annihilation `` brightness '' of dm clumps . in particular , even in the context of the benchmark density profile introduced by navarro , frenk and white 1996 [ nfw ] , the results crucially depend on the substructures mass function , their distribution within the halo host and their virial concentration @xmath20 which is a function of mass and of collapse redshift of dm clumps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we describe the model we have adopted for the smooth component of the galactic halo , and introduce the eight different models for dm substructures that will be discussed in the rest of the paper . in sec.[sec : flux ] we estimate the contribution to the @xmath0-ray flux due to the smooth galactic halo , unresolved dm clumps , and resolved ( detectable ) clumps . in sec.[sec : detection ] , we study the prospects for detection of substructures with upcoming experiments such as glast , and in sec.[sec : conclusions ] we discuss the results and present our conclusions .",
    "high resolution n - body experiments indicate that a large fraction of the mass within dark matter haloes is in the form of virialized subhaloes in all resolved mass scales .",
    "their annihilation signal , which adds to that of the smooth galactic component could be significant ( stoher 2003 , diemand 2006 , diemand 2007a ) .",
    "a precise modeling of both the smooth dm distribution ( the diffuse galactic component ) and the subhalo population within ( the clumpy component ) is therefore mandatory to assess the possibility of detecting dm subhaloes through their annihilation signal .",
    "high resolution numerical simulations enable to study gravitationally bound subhaloes with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the host , and therefore can not resolve substructures in a mw - size halo all the way down to @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the smallest substructures of interest must be studied within host haloes with mass @xmath24 and only at very large redshift ( diemand 2006 ) . at @xmath25 and within a mw - host the smallest subhaloes that we resolve have masses @xmath26 ( diemand 2007a ) as a consequence the spatial distribution , mass function and internal structure of galactic subhaloes",
    "can only be interpolated from the results of several numerical experiments spanning a large range of masses and redshifts using self - similarity arguments .",
    "this interpolation is affected by a number of uncertainties that we account for by exploring different models that meet the numerical constraints .",
    "the recent `` via lactea '' high resolution simulation ( diemand 2007a ) shows that the density profile of a mw - sized dm halo is consistent to within 10% with the nfw profile that we adopt here : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance from the halo center .",
    "this profile depends on two free parameters , the scale density , @xmath29 , and the scale radius , @xmath30 , that are related to each other by the virial mass of the halo , @xmath31 .",
    "the latter is the mass enclosed in a sphere with radius @xmath32 within which the mean density is @xmath33 times above critical .",
    "a different definition of @xmath32 would not change the dm profile nor our results . .",
    "finally , we adopt a small core radius @xmath34 .",
    "an important shape parameter that characterize the density profile is the virial concentration defined as the ratio between the virial radius and the scale radius , @xmath35 .",
    "theoretical considerations corroborated by numerical experiments show that a relation exists between the mass of a halo , its collapse redshift , @xmath36 , and concentration parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the collapse redshift is defined as in bullock 2001 , as the epoch in which a mass scale @xmath31 breaks into the nonlinear regime , i.e. when @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the present linear theory amplitude of mass fluctuation on the scale @xmath31 and @xmath40 is the linear theory growth factor at the redshift @xmath36 .",
    "the two models proposed by bullock 2001 [ b01 ] and eke 2001 [ ens01 ] are consistent for masses larger than @xmath41 and in this paper we use the concentration parameter by b01 to model the diffuse galactic component . on the contrary , for smaller masses ens and b01 predictions become very different and we will have to consider both of them to model the subhaloes annihilation signal .    since a sizable fraction of the mass in the mw is in form of virialized subhaloes ,",
    "there is not a unique way to determine @xmath29 , and @xmath30 of the host mw halo .",
    "for this reason we adopted two different procedures . in the first one we have computed @xmath29 , and @xmath30 as if the total mass of the system , including the clumpy component , were in fact smoothly distributed in the galactic halo . in the second we have considered the total mass of the system to determine the concentration parameter but have used the diffuse component alone to relate @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "having checked that both procedures give similar predictions for the probability of subhalo detection ( section [ sec : flux ] ) , in the following we will only discuss models based on the second approach .",
    "for the milky way we have used a virial mass @xmath42 and a concentration parameter @xmath43 .      .halo model parameters .",
    "column 1 : model name .",
    "column 2 : halo density profile for @xmath44 .",
    "column 3 . halo density profile benchmark for @xmath45 , used as normalization .",
    "column 4 : collapse redshift model , used as normalization .",
    "column 5 : concentration parameter at @xmath46 .",
    "for all the models we have adopted an nfw profile . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab4 ]",
    "the prospects for detecting @xmath0-rays from the annihilation of dm particles in substructures of the mw have been investigated by a number of authors ( e.g. stoehr 2003 , pieri & branchini 2004 , koushiappas 2004 , oda 2005 , pieri 2005 ) . in this work",
    "we confirm that substructures can provide a significant contribution to the expected galactic annihilation signal , although the actual enhancement depends on the assumptions made on the clump properties , which are affected by large uncertainties . indeed , given the assumed substructure mass function @xmath47 , the contribution to the total @xmath0-ray flux by subhaloes of different masses depends on the annihilation signal produced within each clump which is dictated by the internal structure .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that the total annihilation signal is dominated by the highest mass subhaloes both in a galactic halo at z=0 ( stoehr 2003 ) and in 0.1 @xmath48 halo host at z=75 ( diemand 2006 ) .",
    "however , the recent results of the high resolution via lactea simulation ( diemand et al 2007a ) indicate that the annihilation luminosity is approximately constant per decade of substructure mass while analytical calculations ( colafrancesco 2006 ) tend to find that the signal is dominated by small mass subhaloes . indeed this is also the case with our model predictions .",
    "[ phivsmass ] shows the expected contribution of the unresolved haloes to the total annihilation flux as a function of the subhalo mass , integrated on each mass decade .",
    "in all the models explored the annihilation signal is dominated by the smallest clumps , as a result of the decrease of the virial concentration with the subhalo mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . under optmistic assumptions on the particle physics parameters of dm particles",
    ", a glast - like experiment might detect such a dm annihilation flux , but only in a few pixels around the galactic center .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that estimates of the annihilation signal from the galactic center are affected by the poor knowledge of the dm profile in the innermost regions of the galaxy , which is usually obtained by extrapolating over many orders of magnitude the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy makes things even more complicated , as it may significantly affect the distribution of dm within its radius of gravitational influence , leading to the formation of an overdensity called `` spike '' ( gondolo and silk , 1999 ) .",
    "spikes require however rather fine - tuned conditions to form ( ullio et al .",
    "2002 ) and any overdensity is in any case severely suppressed by the interaction with stars and dm self - annihilations ( merritt et al .",
    "2002 , bertone & merritt 2005 ) .    in alternative , one could look for an annihilation signal from individual dm substructures , such as dwarf galaxies or even smaller , baryon - less , clumps .",
    "we have shown that , depending on the assumptions made on the properties of clumps , only large haloes with @xmath49 can be detected and identified with a glast - like experiment , which is consistent with the analyses of stoher 2003 and koushiappas 2004 .",
    "the number of detectable haloes ranges from 0 to more than a hundred , depending on the model . adopting a shallower subhalo mass",
    "function increases the number of detectable subhaloes in those models in which the diffuse annihilation signal is dominated by the unresolved , low mass haloes .    in any case , scenarios leading to a large number of detectable small - scale clumps appear to be severely constrained by the @xmath0-ray background measured by egret",
    ".    in particular , the model of koushiappas 2006 is similar to our model , as far the cosmological term is considered , while the particle physics contribution corresponds to our best case scenario @xmath50 .",
    "although nearby haloes would be bright , and observable , in this case , we have shown that the associated diffuse emission produced by all the remaining , unresolved , clumps in the milky way , would far exceed the @xmath0-ray background measured by egret .",
    "the chances to detect the proper motion of clumps are thus very low , as the lowest mass detectable subhaloes , ( m=@xmath51 ) , are typically found at a distance greater than @xmath52 , leading to a proper motion less than @xmath53 , well below the glast angular resolution of a few arcminutes .",
    "we have made use of simplified and extreme scenarios for the subhaloes concentration parameter models .",
    "more accurate scenarios , though not supported by numerical simulations for small mass haloes , could lead to different diffuse foreground levels and to both more or fewer detectable haloes .    one may wonder why we preferentially expect to individually detect the more massive subhaloes , while the unresolved annihilation signal is mainly contributed by small mass clumps .",
    "the reason is that the volume over which individual haloes can be detected decreases rapidly with the halo mass . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the maximum distance @xmath54 at which a clump can be detected .",
    "this distance depends on the halo luminosity which , in turns , depends on the halo mass and concentration . for a nfw profile : @xmath55 . on the other hand , as discussed e.g. by koushiappas 2006 , given a subhalo mass function @xmath56 , the number of detectable haloes per mass decade is : @xmath57 . assuming a simple scale - free virial concentration @xmath58",
    ", we see that if @xmath59 , then the number of detectable haloes per mass decade halo indeed increases with the subhalo mass .",
    "the @xmath60 relation for some of our models is shown in fig . 2 along with the @xmath61 reference slope ( thick dashed line ) .",
    "models and , that have @xmath62 do indeed predict that the probability of subhalo detection increases with the mass ( see fig . 9 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the @xmath60 relation for @xmath63 is sligthly steeper than @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we expect a bimodal probability that peaks at high masses with a secondary maximum for the smallest subhaloes .",
    "indeed , this is what we observe in figure 9 .    in conclusion , we have studied the prospects for indirect detection of dark matter in mw subhaloes with a glast - like satellite .",
    "we have chosen 8 different models for the concentration parameter , which span the phase space the theoretical uncertainties on the dark matter halo properties , as well as 3 different values for the subhaloes mass function slope .",
    "for each model , we have computed the diffuse emission from unresolved subhaloes , as well as the @xmath0-ray flux from individual , nearby haloes .",
    "we found that for models with concentration parameter computed at @xmath25 the detection of individual haloes appears challenging , while the diffuse emission from unresolved clumps dominates the mw smooth emission for sky directions @xmath65 degree off the gc .    in the case of @xmath66 , in all the @xmath67 models except the , the diffuse emission from unresolved clumps exceeds the egret constraints in a portion of the dm parameter space relevant for susy models , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmavmchi ] . adopting dm models compatible with the egret data ,",
    "one may still hope to detect individual haloes , like e.g. in the model .",
    "the is our best case model for all the values of the mass function slope , though it should be stressed that it is not supported by numerical experiments but only by theoretical considerations .",
    "the success of the model is due to the fact that the diffuse emission expected from subhaloes is dominated by small mass haloes while the large mass haloes are most favourably detected as spare sources . a functional form for the concentration parameter which flattens at low masses , as it is the one , will in fact decrease the diffuse emission , thus allowing a larger value for @xmath68 and consequently increasing the chances of detection for large mass haloes",
    ".    in general , adopting the most optimistic set of parameters for the dm particle compatible with egret ( see table 2 ) , the number of detectable subhaloes over all sky ( at 5@xmath69 , with a glast - like experiment and a 1-year exposure time ) , for the 8 x 3 models we have studied , ranges between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "yet , it should be noticed that the numbers listed in table 2 are obtained with a very optimistic value for the particle physics involved in the process .",
    "if we assume a more realistic model for the dark matter particle ( @xmath72 ) instead , we find that at most only a handful of detectable haloes are found ( at most a handful over all sky for the most optimistic model ) .",
    "in all the models explored , small mass subhaloes are always below the threshold for detection , and their presence could be revealed only through the enhancement of the diffuse foreground emission .",
    "the different predicted ratio between diffuse emission and number of detected haloes for the models we have considered , would provide precious information on the underlying cosmology , in case of positive detection .",
    "we are indebted to j. bullock for help and discussion .",
    "we thank j. diemand , s. koushiappas and g. tormen for useful discussions , comments and suggestions ."
