    "the lhc experiment totem  @xcite is designed for measuring the elastic pp scattering cross - section , the total pp cross - section and diffractive processes .",
    "these physics objectives require the detection of leading protons with scattering angles of a few @xmath0rad , which is accomplished using a roman pot ( `` rp '' ) system with stations at 147 m and 220 m from the interaction point 5 where also cms will be located .",
    "each station is composed of two rp units separated by a few metres depending on beam equipment integration constraints .",
    "each rp unit consists of a vacuum chamber equipped with two vertical insertions ( top and bottom ) and a horizontal one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rp ] ) .",
    "each insertion ( `` pot '' ) contains a package of 10 silicon detectors in a secondary vacuum .",
    "the pots can be moved into the primary vacuum of the machine through vacuum bellows . in order to minimise the distance of the detectors from the beam , and to minimise multiple scattering , the wall thickness of the pot",
    "is locally reduced to a thin window foil .",
    "the low impedance budget of the lhc machine ( broadband longitudinal  impedance limit @xmath1 ) imposes a tight limit on the rps beam coupling impedance .",
    "the beam coupling impedance measurement was performed with the wire method like with the first rp prototype in 2004  @xcite . after pulling a 0.3 mm thick wire through the rp along its beam axis",
    ", a vector network analyser was used to measure the complex transmission coefficient @xmath2 between the two ends of the rp ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) as a function of the frequency @xmath3 and of the horizontal and vertical pot distances ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) from the wire .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows the measurement result for all pots in retracted position and compares it with simulations based on two different programs .",
    "while the simulations describe qualitatively all main structures seen in the data , the resonances are shifted in frequency by up to 20% .",
    "this disagreement is attributed to the modelling of the bellows in the simulations .",
    "an exact model requires a very dense mesh of the volume which compromises the simulation convergence in an acceptable cpu time .",
    "substituting the bellows with a longer smooth cylinder of an equivalent total metallic surface provides good agreement at the first mode frequency ( @xmath6500mhz ) , but does not succeed at higher frequencies . improved numerical simulation models will be studied .     with all pots in retracted position ( @xmath7 mm ) .",

    "the measurement with all pots in retracted position served as reference measurement @xmath12 after removal of all resonances by interpolation in both modulus and phase .",
    "the approximately gaussian lhc bunch structure with @xmath13ns leads to a gaussian envelope with @xmath14ghz in the frequency distribution of the lhc current with harmonics every 40mhz .",
    "hence the relevant resonances lie well below 1ghz .",

    "the impedance value of 700@xmath15 for mode 1b at @xmath16 mm corresponds to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , or a dissipated power of about 200w , which demonstrates the necessity of mitigating hardware modifications .",
    "the latter were realised in the form of a collar of ferrite tiles around the pot insertions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rp ] , right ) .",
    "they had the desired effect of smearing out all resonances beyond recognition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ferrites ] ) .     before and after installation of the ferrite tiles .",
    "]      the transverse impedance was only measured for the configuration without ferrite tiles where resonances were visible . for technical reasons , neither the two - wire method nor",
    "a movable wire were practicable .",
    "instead , the two vertical pots were moved asymmetrically , keeping their relative distance @xmath19  the jaw width  constant . then the longitudinal impedance was measured as a function of the excentricity @xmath20 , i.e. the position of the jaw centre with respect to the wire ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse ] , top and middle ) . after a parabolic fit @xmath21 , where ideally @xmath22 by virtue of symmetry",
    ", a combination of vertical transverse impedance @xmath23 and detuning impedance @xmath24 can be obtained from the curvature parameter @xmath25 , like in the moving wire technique  @xcite : @xmath26 since there is only one horizontal pot , no analogous measurement of the x - component @xmath27 could be made , which would have enabled the elimination of @xmath24 .",
