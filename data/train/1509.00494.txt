    "a breakthrough in the area of cuprate superconductivity is the observation of quantum oscillations in cuprates  @xcite . in these experiments a strong magnetic field",
    "is applied to suppress the superconductivity , which most likely reveals the ground state  @xcite without superconductivity .",
    "however , the understanding of this `` normal state '' may be a crucial ingredient in the theory high temperature superconductivity .",
    "standing in the way are at least two important issues : ( 1 ) does the quantum oscillation frequencies substantially deviate from the classic onsager rule for which the oscillation frequency @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is equal to the extremal fermi surface area normal to the magnetic field ?",
    "if so , it would lead to considerable uncertainty in the interpretation of the experiments .",
    "( 2 ) do the oscillations ride on top of a magnetic field dependence of the density of states(dos ) @xmath7 ?",
    "@xcite if so , it might indicate the presence of superconducting fluctuations even in high magnetic fields at zero temperature , @xmath8 , from an extrapolation of a result of volovik ,  @xcite which is supposed to be asymptotically true as @xmath9 .",
    "therefore high field behavior requires careful analyses .",
    "quantum oscillations require the existence of landau levels .",
    "if this is true , they might indicate the existence of normal fermi liquid quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued from a theoretical analysis that the onsager rule could be violated by as much as @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "we find that under reasonable set of parameters , to be defined below , the violation is miniscule , @xmath11 . even for extreme situations discussed in ref .  , it is less than @xmath12",
    ". if we are correct , one can use the onsager rule to interpret the experiments with impunity .",
    "the second encouraging result is that @xmath3 saturates in the regime where oscillations are present .",
    "we interpret this to mean that there are generically no superconducting fluctuations in high fields .",
    "a recent specific heat measurement  @xcite shows that the specific heat indeed saturates at high fields , signifying that the normal state is achieved .    to put our paper in the context , note",
    "that in conventional @xmath13-wave superconductors , previous work has shown that for higher landau level indices , and within coherent potential approximation , vortices mainly damp the oscillation amplitude , but the shift in the oscillation frequency  @xcite is negligible ; however , for @xmath2-wave underdoped cuprate superconductors with small coherence length and high fields with landau level indices @xmath14 this calculation should not hold  @xcite . a more recent semi - classical analysis based on an ansatz of _ gaussian phase fluctuations _ of the @xmath15wave pairing",
    "@xcite indicates that the oscillation frequency is unchanged , as here .",
    "however , relatively undamped quantum oscillations riding on top of @xmath16 was found in this dynamic gaussian ansatz that does not account for vortices , which must necessarily be present , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the branch cuts introduced by the vortices must also be taken into account .",
    "we consider the vortices explicitly in the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and model the vortex liquid state as quenched , randomly distributed vortices , paying special attention to branch cuts .",
    "there are other important differences as well , as we shall discuss below .",
    "to have a complete picture , we also consider the low field regime where the quantum oscillations disappear . in this regime",
    "the vortices arrange themselves into a vortex solid state and should be modeled as an ordered lattice instead .",

    "the results are discussed in sec .",

    "we ignore self consistency , as we believe that it can not change the major striking conclusions .",
    "besides the hopping parameters , the normal state hamiltonian @xmath19 contains a variety of mean field order parameters defined below . although many different orders are suggested to explain the normal state of the high-@xmath21 superconductivity , for our purposes it is sufficient to consider three different types : a period-2 @xmath15density wave ( ddw )  @xcite , a bi - directional charge density wave ( cdw ) , and a period@xmath22 ddw model  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our major conclusions in this paper do not depend on the nature of the density wave that is responsible for fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "the ddw is argued to be able to account for many features of quantum oscillations , as well as the pseudogap state  @xcite in the cuprates . among the many different versions of density waves of higher angular momentum  @xcite , the simplest period-2 singlet ddw , also the same as staggered flux state in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also a period@xmath22 ddw order , proposed by us previously to explain quantum oscillations@xcite , have been chosen here for illustration .",

    "in other words the presence of vortex scattering does not alter the oscillation frequencies .",
    "the observations here , combined with the other two cases , strongly suggest that the onsager s relation being intact in the presence of vortex scattering is generic and independent of the order parameters that reconstruct the fermi surface .",
    "in the above we have examined the effects of random vortex scattering on the quantum oscillations .",
    "now we give an overview of the @xmath27 dependence of the dos for fields @xmath160 , at a representative value of @xmath161 . at lower fields ,",
    "the vortex liquid model is not valid any more , since vortices should order into a solid instead .",
    "therefore we should use a vortex lattice to model such a state . in the following we focus on the high field regime first and defer our vortex lattice discussions for the low field regime to the later section  [ sec : vtx - solid ] .      in fig .",

    "the normal state should be understood as a state , which does not have any superconductivity but can have a particle - hole density wave order . and",
    "all the dos value calculated is for one electron in a single @xmath164 plane , without including the spin degeneracy . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - tpp-2fddw - overview ] we see that as @xmath27 decreases , the dos oscillation gets suppressed gradually .",
    "this is because the orbital quantization of electrons becomes dominated by the vortex scattering .",

    ", we require the vortex lattice to be commensurate with our original @xmath164 lattice , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vtxsolid ] .",
    "namely , if the vortex lattice spacings are @xmath166 , and the corresponding vortex lattice size is @xmath167 , we require that the original @xmath164 lattice size @xmath168 satisfies @xmath169 . for a particular value of @xmath168 , this restricts the possible values of @xmath166 and also the possible values of the magnetic field , because the vortex lattice spacings @xmath170 are connected to the magnetic flux density via @xmath171 , where @xmath135 is the fundamental flux quanta . in our following calculation",
    "we pick a particular value of the system size @xmath168 , find all the possible compatible values of the vortex lattice spacings @xmath172 , and then for each of them calculate the magnetic field @xmath27 as well as the corresponding dos .",
