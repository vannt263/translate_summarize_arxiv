    "a majority of nearby galaxies are disk galaxies , still undergoing a significant amount of stellar formation . in order to understand how these objects have evolved towards their current shapes , sizes , and masses , it is important to find out if these objects , as a population , have changed significantly over the last few billions years .",
    "several groups have recently attempted to study disk dominated galaxies over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "@xcite observed that disk galaxies , selected from their broad band morphologies did not show a significant sign of size evolution over the redshift range of @xmath6 .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the size evolution of disk galaxies up to @xmath7 and showed that these luminous objects ( @xmath8 ) showed a strong evolution in the magnitude - size relation , with an increase in surface brightness of 1 mag per square arc - second in the v band rest - frame .",
    "they also found these objects to have lower mass - to - light ratio at @xmath7 than at the present day and interpreted this as a lack of evolution between stellar mass and effective disk sizes in these objects .",
    "their finding contradicts the results from @xcite who found that the size of high redshift ( @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) galaxies appear to evolve as @xmath11 , in agreement with hierarchical formation theory . in this paper",
    ", we examine the physical properties of a new sample of star - forming galaxies .",
    "these objects were selected purely spectroscopically and , unlike previous studies , allow us to examine the morphology , size , surface brightness , and mass evolution of star forming galaxies without having to first pre - assume anything about the physical attributes of these objects .",
    "are higher redshift star forming galaxies smaller , less massive than present day ones ?",
    "are their mass - to - light ratio significantly different than present day galaxies ? in this paper , we examine these specific issues . +",
    "the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is currently , and likely to remain for several years , the deepest set of observations ever taken of the sky .",
    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images of this field are extremely deep , containing over 10,000 - 15,000 galaxies down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath12 ( ab magnitude ) , have a small pixel scale ( 0.03/pixel ) , and a very stable psf . while the off - axis location of acs in the hst focal plane results in a significant amount of image distortion , it is now a well calibrated and correctable effect ( down to less than 0.1 pixel in the hudf images ) .",
    "these images thus provide an excellent opportunity to measure the size and morphology of faint galaxies ( @xmath13 ) , extending previous studies to much lower luminosities .",
    "while the hudf images do not provide spectroscopic redshifts of individual sources , the grapes program ( grism acs program for extragalactic science , pi : malhotra , see description in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yielded slitless spectroscopic observations of 1400 objects with @xmath14 , or about 10% of the sources in the hudf ) .",
    "we identified objects ( egrapes ) with prominent emission lines @xcite .",
    "ten egrapes are lyman-@xmath15 sources at @xmath16 @xcite , while the bulk of egrapes actually lay at redshifts of @xmath17 .",
    "+ since the hudf images reach 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the limiting magnitude of the grapes catalog , all of the objects in the grapes catalog have very high signal - to - noise images in the , , , and  hudf acs observations ( corresponding roughly to the b , v , i , and z bandpasses ) .",
    "we estimate the limiting surface brightness of the hudf images to be 25.7 , 26.5 , 25.6 , and 24.9 magnitude per square arc - second .",
    "in addition to this , near infrared observations of the hudf have also been available @xcite and offer j and h band observations for a large number of these objects , albeit at a much lower resolution ( 0.09/pixel ) .",
    "this allows for accurate measurements of the magnitude , shape and size of these objects to be made in different rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "for the purpose of studying variation in physical properties of egrapes as a function of redshift , it is useful to start by defining the following redshift bins , each initially containing an almost equal number of egrapes ( @xmath182030 ) : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . the average ( median )",
    "redshift of objects in each of these bins is @xmath23 respectively . in these four bins ,",
    "the 4350 rest - frame corresponds to the observed wavelengths of 5220 , 6133 , 7526 , and 9353 , nearly equivalent to the , , ,   acs bandpasses . throughout this paper",
    ", we computed 4350 rest - frame parameters ( magnitude , sizes , morphologies ) by linearly interpolating between measurements of these quantities made separately in the two closest available acs bands .",
    "+ the initial number of egrapes is relatively small ( 124 ) , but we must further impose a luminosity cut on our sample so that measurements at lower redshifts we make are not biased by less luminous , smaller galaxies whose counterparts would not have been detected at higher redshifts . assuming a concordant cosmology with @xmath24 , the grapes limiting magnitude of = 27 implies that only objects brighter than @xmath25 would be observed at @xmath26 . based on simulations , we estimate that more than 90% of emission lines with an line equivalent - width greater than 75  were detected @xcite .",
    "applying this luminosity cut further lowers the number of emission line objects down to 0175 , and the number of objects remaining in each of our redshift bin is 5 , 9 , 13 , 27 .    in this paper , we also carried out a parallel analysis of non - emission line galaxies with known photometric redshifts .",
    "the redshifts of these objects were determined by the goods project using the combined acs ( bviz ) and nicmos ( jh ) data from the hudf and deep k_s band ( isaac ) data .",
    "all these data were degraded to the isaac seeing ( 0.4 arcsec ) and combined to estimate photometric redshifts by fitting their seds to those of rest - frame templates .",
    "the photometric redshifts of the non - emission line objects presented in this paper , measured using luminosity function priors , have an accuracy of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of these non - emission line galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper and we only use these objects to serve as a comparison sample against which we can compare our egrapes sample .",
    "there are several well established methods to measure the size and shape of galaxies and we studied the morphology of egrapess using three separate methods .",
    "first , we measured the apparent size ( half - light radius , @xmath28 ) and magnitude each egrapes in the , , , and   bands using the sextractor program @xcite ( in dual image mode using a combination of the   and   band images as the detection image ) .",
    "+ second , we also used the program galfit @xcite to fit a srsic profile @xcite to each objects .",
    "this profile is of the form @xmath29}$ ] , where @xmath30 is the effective radius of the source , @xmath31 is the surface brightness at @xmath30 , @xmath32 is the power - law index , and @xmath33 is a normalization constant . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the srsic profile reduces to a classic de vaucouleurs profile while for @xmath35 it reduces to an exponential disk profile .",
    "we used segmentation maps from sextractor as input masks when running galfit and we started each fit with an initial value of @xmath34 . while many egrapes appear to be relatively small on the acs images ( @xmath36 hudf pixels ) , this did not affect the sextractor and galfit size estimates and both agreed reasonably well .",
    "+ third , we computed the concentration ( c ) and asymmetry ( a ) values @xcite of egrapess .",
    "measuring a consists of rotating and subtracting a galaxy image from itself and computing the sum of the absolute value of the residuals .",
    "measuring c consists in computing the logarithm of the ratio of the radii enclosing 20% and 80% of the light in the object .",
    "the relations between a , c , and galaxy morphology have been extensively studied in the past @xcite and have been well calibrated using a sample of nearby objects @xcite .",
    "this last method proved to be the most difficult one to apply to egrapes which appear as small objects in the hudf .",
    "@xcite estimated that a physical image resolution of 0.5 kpc was acceptable in order to produce reliable measurements of a , and they defined the parameter @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath38 falls significantly under unity , cas parameters , and the asymmetry parameter a in particular , become less reliable .",
    "@xcite showed that they were able to successfully measure cas values of objects with @xmath39 .",
    "additionally , the reliability of cas measurements of objects with different surface brightnesses was investigated by @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that a signal - to - noise ration per pixel @xmath40 was required for unbiased asymmetry measurements ( a lower number of high signal - to - noise pixels , as diffuse extended regions of objects become invisible , cause a to be computed using a smaller number of pixels which then artificially increases the estimate of a. see figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the hudf acs z band images have a resolution of 0.084  ( combining the pixel scale and the size of the acs psf ) , corresponding to @xmath41 for @xmath42 , which , while lower than the value recommended by @xcite , is larger than the accepted value used by @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless independently investigated the effect that small egrapes sizes might have on our cas measurements of these objects .",
    "we started by selecting 166 large and bright objects and measured their cas values after scaling down the size of the images by factors of 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "we found that a measurements remained robust , and c measurements remained mostly unaffected as long as objects had a half - light radius ( r_50 ) that is equal or greater than 5 hudf pixels .",
    "we computed the @xmath43 for egrapess in the filter closest to the 4350 rest frame wavelength and verified that the high - signal to noise acs imaging ensured that @xmath40 for these objects .",
    "since egrapess were not selected based on their physical attributes , we did not a - priori attempt to select objects with late - type colors and morphologies .",
    "one can however distinguish galaxies of different spectral types using a simple rest - frame color versus absolute magnitude plot as well as color versus cas parameter plots .",
    "@xcite showed that determining the spectral type of objects in this manner remains consistent across a broad range of redshifts and angular sizes .",
    "figure [ morph1 ] shows the egrapes population plotted in a rest - frame ( - ) versus rest - frame @xmath44  magnitude diagram .",
    "it is clear from figure [ morph1 ] that egrapess are extremely blue compared to local , present day galaxies , and that nearly all egrapes are even bluer than local sc - irregular galaxies .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , confirm that the spectroscopically selected egrapess preferentially occupy the late and intermediate parts of rest - frame ( - ) versus c and a plots , respectively .",
    "in fact , 90% of egrapes would be classified as late type if one were to rely on these plots .",
    "the high fraction of late - type galaxies amongst egrapes has also been confirmed by the work of @xcite who assigned irregular or starburst spectral types to 68% of egrapes based on photometric band fitting .",
    "we classified egrapess in separate morphological groups based on our galfit srsic fit : mergers ( @xmath45 ) , and non - mergers ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we assumed that most merger system have in fact light profiles which are significantly flatter than pure exponential profiles @xcite .",
    "we found that 11 objects with @xmath47 qualify as mergers ( 19% of total ) and furthermore plot the fraction of merger candidate as a function of redshift in figure [ galfitratio ] .",
    "no strong trend is visible in figure [ galfitratio ] and the fraction of egrapes merger candidates remains small at all reshifts except near @xmath2 where the merger fraction increases marginally .",
    "the number of available objects is small however and the errors are dominated by small number statistics and a larger population of egrapes is required to confirm this observation .",
    "+ we also computed the asymmetry ( a ) and concentration ( c ) of egrapess in the  rest - frame .",
    "as discussed earlier , we restricted the cas analysis to egrapess that are large enough and that have a surface brightness that is high enough to allow for unbiased cas measurements .",
    "figure [ fcasa ] shows that neither the asymmetry nor the concentration of these objects appear to evolve significantly as a function of redshift .",
    "+ one can only conclude at this point that there does not appear to be a significant change in the average morphology of egrapess , as a population , from the redshift of @xmath48 to the present day .",
    "however , the number of egrapess for which these measurements could be performed in an unbiased way is small and a much larger sample would be required to definitively state that these objects did not change much , as a population .",
    "we also examine the physical sizes of egrapes ( half - light radius , @xmath28 ) as a function of redshift to shed some light on the evolution of this group of star forming galaxies over the last 8 billions years .",
    "we computed the apparent   rest - frame sizes of egrapess ( in arc - seconds ) by interpolating the half - light radii measured individually using sextractor in the , , ,   bands .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the egrapes sizes as a function of redshift for objects with @xmath47 , as well as the sizes of photometric redshift galaxies in the field .",
    "+ @xcite showed a sample of what the authors assumed to be disk supported galaxies to be evolving roughly as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the hubble parameter , in agreement with what is expected if the @xcite model of disk formation with fixed disk circular velocity within dark matter halos is correct . at first glance",
    ", it appears that egrapes sizes evolve very little as a function of redshift , and certainly less than disk dominated galaxies from previous studies such as @xcite .",
    "our control sample of non - emission line , photometric redshift galaxies appear to have sizes that closely follow a @xmath11 evolution model but have sizes that are overall still much smaller than the data from @xcite .",
    "+ several effects have to be taken into account however before any conclusion can be made .",
    "first , egrapess were selected spectroscopically based on the presence of emission lines in their slitless spectra @xcite .",
    "the resolution in such spectra is directly affected by the physical size of the underlying object @xcite which could lead to some biases against the detection of larger objects .",
    "as objects get larger , the effective resolution of the grism observations is reduced and the sharpness of any emission line in the spectra is lowered .",
    "we estimated this effect using a monte - carlo simulation containing 100,000 simulated spectra with a wide range of line equivalent widths , objects sizes and brightnesses .",
    "the underlying size distribution of these simulated objects was taken directly from @xcite at redshifts of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( with average sizes of 0.6  and 0.3  , respectively ) .",
    "our simulations showed that most of the emission lines in these simulated spectra , even when they corresponded to objects that were significantly larger than egrapess , were properly detected .",
    "the resulting average sizes for the simulated egrapess were 0.5  and 0.3  in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bins respectively , hence demonstrating that our egrapes sample is not strongly biased towards small sources .",
    "+ another thing to keep in mind is that @xcite selected objects using a rest - frame uv luminosity cut corresponding to @xmath53 for a @xmath54 lbg @xcite , while the small area covered by the hudf forces us to select objects with @xmath55=-17.5 .",
    "we did estimate the impact that our luminosity cut has on the average sizes by computing new mean sizes using a series of luminosity cuts : objects with @xmath56 , where l * is the luminosity of galaxies with absolute magnitudes m * , were selected while m * was varied over a large range of possible values ranging from -23.0 to -16.0 . as increasingly brighter objects were selected using increasingly high luminosity cuts , the average sizes of egrapes in each redshift bin increased only marginally ( while the number of egrapes left in each redshift bin decreased significantly ) . at @xmath57 ( which is within the range of redshifts probed by @xcite ) , the average size of objects increased from 0.2  at m=-16 to 0.27  at m=-20.5",
    "the impact of our lower luminosity cut is therefore not likely to be the cause of the large observed size differences shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "+ the last thing to realize when comparing egrapes sizes to the ones from @xcite is that our measurements were made in the  rest - frame while @xcite used the 1500  rest - frame . while this has the advantage to allow us to measure the radial extend of these objects based on their global stellar mass distribution rather than based on the instantaneous , unobscured , star formation as measured in the uv @xcite , it makes it difficult to compare our results to the @xcite results . in order to properly compare the two",
    ", we must estimate the difference in sizes of these objects when observed in the 1500  and 4350  rest - frames .",
    "we estimated the magnitude of this effect using the sample of galaxies with known photometric redshift from @xcite that are at @xmath58 and that were successfully detected in the acs  band as well as the nicmos j band observations of the hudf .",
    "measuring the sizes of these objects in both the  band and the j band , allowed us to directly measure their sizes in both the 1500  and 4350  rest - frames , respectively .",
    "sizes were measured using the same method described above in both the acs  band image and the nicmos j band image .",
    "we first matched the resolution of the acs  band image to the resolution of the nicmos image using stars in the hudf @xcite .",
    "we then computed the average ratio of sizes between the degraded acs b band image ( i.e. 1500  rest - frame ) and the nicmos j band image ( i.e. 4350  rest - frame ) .",
    "we found that the average size ratio is @xmath59 , a value that is somewhat larger than what was observed by @xcite who estimated this bandpass effect to be only 20% at @xmath60 , using gems galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig2b ] shows the estimated egrapes 4350  rest - frame sizes compared to the @xcite data . by applying this correction to the photometric redshift galaxy sample",
    "the size distribution of these objects agree well with the result from @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "egrapes remain smaller at all redshifts , even after correction for wavebands .",
    "we compare the size evolution of egrapes to that of non - emission line photometric redshift objects by plotting the proper physical size of these objects ( in kpc ) as a function of redshift , as shown in figure [ r50zm17 ] .",
    "if sizes increases as @xmath49 , one would expect that the proper sizes of these objects to monotonically increase by a factor of 2 between @xmath57 and @xmath61 .",
    "such a trend is clearly not present in figure [ r50zm17 ] and no significant evolution ( i.e. @xmath62 ) is observed .",
    "the least square fit of the sizes of egrapes is @xmath63 .",
    "the proper sizes of the non star forming galaxies with known photometric redshift are also plotted ( dot - dashed line ) and show a strong redshift dependence , as expected @xcite .",
    "we estimated the effect of cosmological dimming on our size measurements using simulations and one would expect sizes to vary by a factor of two between the reshifts of z=0.3 and z=1.5 , while it is difficult to apply this effect as a correction to our measurements , we can conclude that egrapes at low redshifts are certainly no larger than those at higher redshifts and might even have been larger in the past , but this claim would have to be verified with further observations and an larger number of egrapes .",
    "one is left with the overall picture that egrapess are a population of objects heterogeneous in nature but whose redshift evolution , at least as far as proper sizes are concerned , may not be coupled to the underlying dark matter halo distributions , unlike non - egrapes objects .",
    "the small field area of the hudf and the small number of sources does however make this result sensitive to cosmic variation and small number statistics .",
    "further hst / acs grism observations , over a wider area , such as from the pears project ( probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically , pi : malhotra ) should allow us to confirm this result in the future .    related to the size evolution of egrapes ,",
    "is the question of surface brightness evolution of these objects . following @xcite , we can compute the effective surface brightness of these objects in the rest - frame b band using : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the absolute rest - frame magnitude in the b - band , @xmath66 is the half - light radius in kpc from our galfit fits , and @xmath67 is the axis ratio of the object determined by galfit .",
    "we computed the effective surface brightness of egrapes and photometric redshift galaxies and plot it as a function of redshift in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "a strong monotonic decrease in the surface brightness ( @xmath68 magnitudes ) is visible between the redshift of z=1.15 to z=0.2 .",
    "the same effect is however observed in the non - emission line objects in the field , albeit the later have on average a much lower surface brightness than egrapes ( by about @xmath69 mag at all redshifts ) .",
    "the surface brightness evolution of egrapes does not therefore appear to be peculiar and the only distinction that egrapes have when compared to other galaxies in the field is that they have a very high surface brightness .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] also shows the effect that cosmological dimming has on the measured effective surface brightness . the change in effective surface brightness caused by surface dimming is essentially flat , especially from z=0.5 to z=1.5 , with a decrease of 0.6 magnitude from z=0.25 to z=1.5 .",
    "simulations showed that as objects were dimmed artificially , the measured radius decreased while the measured object flux also decreased , causing the surface brightness to remain mostly unaffected .",
    "these simulations were done by taking low redshift egrapes , scaling down the flux originating from the source ( after masking out the background regions of the image ) , re - computing and adding poisson noise to the dimmed down image , adding back the original background , and re - running sextractor and galfit to derived new sizes for the object .",
    "the effective surface brightness of egrapes increases with redshift , which could potentially be an indication of a change in the average stellar population of egrapes as a function of redshift .",
    "it is interesting to actually examine whether the size of egrapes is related to their stellar population",
    ". figure [ rebv ] shows egrapes plotted in a rest - frame ( b - v ) vs @xmath28 plot .",
    "as this figure shows , there does not appear to be a correlation between the two .",
    "we found that egrapes have a median size of 1.28 kpc with sizes ranging from @xmath70 kpc , and a median luminosity of @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ r50 mb ] further shows how the size and luminosity of egrapes compare to local galaxies and to @xmath72 objects from the hubble deep field ( udf ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "we find that egrapess are significantly smaller and less luminous than the bulk of elliptical galaxies and slightly smaller than most of the @xmath73 sources identified in the hudf . on the other hand ,",
    "egrapes sizes are consistent with the observed sizes of local irregulars , dwarfs , hii and cnelgs ( compact narrow emission line galaxies ) . yet ,",
    "egrapess appear to be significantly less luminous than local irregulars at any given size , or , equivalently , have significantly smaller sizes at any given luminosity than local irregulars , resulting in egrapess appearing as objects with high surface brightness as shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "we can further investigate the nature of egrapes by computing estimates of their mass - to - light ratios and masses .",
    "these estimates were conducted using two independent techniques .",
    "first , we used the method of @xcite , as used by @xcite , which relates the rest - frame color of galaxies to their sdss r - band mass - to - light ratio and which , when using the rest - frame ( b - r ) color was shown to be relatively insensitive to the detailed star formation history , metallicity , and dust content of galaxies .",
    "we computed the rest - frame ( b - r ) colors of egrapes as described above .",
    "the presence of emission line in the spectra of these objects was taken into account and results in at most a 0.050.10 magnitude photometric uncertainty which in turn corresponds to an error in the mass estimates of these objects of about 20% .",
    "the mass estimates obtained in this manner are somewhat uncertain ( @xmath74 ) , especially for late - type objects such as egrapes .",
    "the results we discuss in this paper are for a population of star - forming galaxy as a whole and not for individual objects .",
    "we can not of course follow the evolution of any single star - forming galaxy .",
    "what we can do however is to examine whether the entire population of egrapes has changed during the past few billions years .",
    "the mass of egrapes , @xmath75 , allowing for the differences between the sdss and the acs filters @xcite , can be estimated using : @xmath76 and the stellar mass of @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the apparent srsic magnitude at 6250  , and @xmath79 is the luminosity distance of the object .",
    "the second method we used is significantly more involved and involves the modeling of the stellar populations of each object separately in order to determine its mass - to - light ratio from the data .",
    "we followed a phenomenological approach describing the star formation history by a reduced set of parameters , which allowed us to scan a large range of possible star formation histories using a two stellar component system @xcite .",
    "each of these component is a simple stellar population from the models of @xcite , with a salpeter imf in the standard mass range ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we assumed the same metallicity for both components , and we included the effect of dust reddening and attenuation from the prescription of @xcite for the younger component .",
    "the parameters that describe this model are the ages of both components ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) ; the mass ratio between the components ( e.g. characterized by @xmath83 , the mass fraction in young stars ) ; and the metallicity of both populations and the dust content  given by @xmath84 .",
    "we chose three different metallicities : @xmath85 and explored a grid of @xmath86 star formation histories for each metallicity , which comprises the range of parameters shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we used , , , and  photometry from the acs images and  where available ( 86 out of 114 objects )  nicmos @xmath87 and @xmath50 photometry .",
    "we did not allow the egrapes redshifts to change and , for each galaxy , the grid of models described above was run and a maximum likelihood method was used to determine the stellar masses .",
    "figure [ mvsz ] shows the derived masses for each choice of metallicity , as well as the masses obtained using the simple photometric method described earlier .",
    "we have not included the error bars for the uncertainties expected from the color - sfh degeneracy , which amount to @xmath88  dex in @xmath89 .    based on the fact that the egrapes sample selection was limited to objects with @xmath90 , we can estimate the lower limiting stellar mass of the egrapes sample by assuming a typical stellar population for these galaxies .",
    "assuming an age of 0.5  gyr , we find that the limiting egrapes stellar mass is @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "this is well below the egrapes sed derived mass estimates shown in figure [ mvsz ] .",
    "figure [ mvsz ] shows the individual and binned egrapes phometric mass estimates as well as the binned averages of the sed derived masses computed for 1/10 , 1/3 , and solar metallicities.the average photometric - mass of the egrapes population is @xmath93 .",
    "our sed - fitting method yielded the mass estimates of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath95 for assuming solar , 1/3 solar , and 1/10 solar metalicities , respectively .",
    "all of our mass estimates agree well and are essentially redshift independent .",
    "we find that egrapess have masses that are similar to that of low - mass galaxies galaxies ( e.g. @xmath96 ) and about 10 times lower than l * galaxies today @xcite , independently of the metallicity we assumed for these objects .",
    "egrapes masses are similar to the mass estimates of compact narrow emission line galaxies ( cnelg ) and luminous compact blue galaxies ( lbg ) ( @xmath97 * ? ? ?",
    "these objects , which are believed to be star forming galaxies , are believed by some be the progenitors of today s more massive spiral disks galaxies @xcite or local dwarf elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the relation between egrapess and lcbgs is discussed further in the next section .",
    "figure [ ml ] further shows the estimated mass - to - light ratio of the egrapes sample . the mass - to - light ratio of these objects is low ( @xmath98 ) , indicating that egrapes are objects with a young stellar population and/or that have just undergone some major starburst .",
    "figure [ ml ] also indicates that the mass - to - light ratio of egrapes is lower at high redshifts .",
    "while we observed most of the physical attributes ( such as sizes and morphology ) of egrapes to be uncorrelated to redshift , the increase in mass - to - light ratio at lower redshift could be due to the fact that , on average , the observed stellar population of egrapes is older at lower redshifts .",
    "this could be evidence that , on average , egrapes were more actively forming stars at higher redshifts , or that , alternatively , that we observe more newly born egrapes at high redshifts , assuming that younger galaxies have a higher fraction of mass in the form of gas and therefore a higher star formation rater per unit mass ) .",
    "+ a possible alternative would be that egrapes are more luminous at higher redshifts , even though they are observed to have similar sizes at all redshifts .",
    "however , while we do observe a lower number of high luminosity egrapes ( @xmath99 ) at low redshifts than at high redshifts , one must keep in mind that the hudf field is small and that the volumes probed at low reshifts are small .",
    "the change of observing high luminosity egrapes at low redshifts is therefore low .",
    "for example , if we restrict ourselves to [ oii ] emission line egrapes at a redshift @xmath100 with @xmath47 , we find that @xmath101 egrapes have @xmath99 at @xmath102 while @xmath103 egrapes have @xmath99 at @xmath104 .",
    "an increase in the number of high luminosity egrapes as a function of redshift is therefore not significantly detected in this study and the difference in the number of observed bright egrapes can be explained away as the result of the relatively small volume that is probed by this study at low redshifts .",
    "it is therefore likely that the observed redshift dependence of the egrapes mass - to - light ratio is the result of genuinely different stellar populations .",
    "we found egrapes to be emission line galaxies that are intrinsically very blue , compact galaxies of only a few kpc in size , and with a high surface brightness .",
    "these objects are reminiscent of a class of objects called luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbg , * ? ? ?",

    "these were initially identified as very blue , unresolved stellar sources in ground based qso surveys @xcite .",

    "they include compact narrow emission line galaxies ( cnelgs ) @xcite and blue nucleated galaxies at larger redshifts @xcite . based on the work from @xcite , we can identify lcbg candidates amongst the egrapes sample by selecting egrapes that have a high surface brightness ( @xmath105 ) , are blue ( @xmath106 ) , and have a high luminosity ( @xmath107 ) . while egrapes were not initially selected based on these size , surface brightness , and luminosity cuts , figure [ surfm ]",
