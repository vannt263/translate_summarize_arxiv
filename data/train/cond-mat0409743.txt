    "confinement to nanoscale dimensions and the resulting quantization of electrons gives rise to two - dimensional quantum films , one - dimensional quantum wires , or zero - dimensional quantum dots .",
    "all three situations may exhibit properties and functionalities that make them different from the corresponding bulk material . in this respect ,",
    "research on nanocatalysis is inspired by the expectation that due to such a reduced dimensionality of the active material new catalytic behavior can arise , which is not scalable from bulk - like properties .",
    "@xcite a salient target of such investigations are nanometer - size clusters of atoms , representing the three - dimensional confinement situation .",
    "while the potential of such clusters for catalytic applications is just being explored , it has already been recognized that they often exhibit the undesirable propensity to coarsen into larger aggregates on the support material .",
    "this problem could be less severe for the case of confinement in only one dimension , i.e. when striving for appealing properties of nanometer or sub - nanometer thin films .",
    "in fact , at the catalyst surface such films may even form automatically during the induction period , as a consequence of the exposure to the operating conditions .",
    "a prominent example of this is oxidation catalysis , where the oxygen - rich environment might oxidize the sample .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical studies noted that particularly at late transition metals ( tms ) few or even one atomic - layer thin , so - called surface oxide films are formed , when these are held in a realistic gas - phase environment under catalytic or alike @xmath1-conditions .",
    "the vertical confinement makes these films distinct to surfaces of both bulk metals and bulk oxides , and their specific properties can have beneficial , as well as detrimental effects on the desired functionality .",
    "appropriately tailoring and exploiting these functionalities requires an atomic - scale characterization and understanding of the oxidation process , as well as of the resulting surface composition and stoichiometry ( under the steady - state reaction conditions ) .",
    "although oxide formation has been of technological and scientific interest since long , such an understanding is , however , only just emerging , and the underlying microscopic processes are unfortunately still largely unclear for everything that goes beyond sub - monolayer oxygen adsorbate phases on low - index single crystal surfaces .",
    "this holds in particular for the transition from an oxygen adsorbate layer to the surface oxide .",
    "a main reason behind this lack of understanding is that atomic - scale investigations of tm surfaces on the verge of oxide formation still pose a significant challenge for surface scientists : the need for rather high oxygen partial pressures ( high compared to those possible in standard surface science experiments ) and elevated temperatures required to initiate the process , a low degree of order at the surface , and often complex , large unit - cell geometries name but a few of the obstacles encountered . since this often exceeds the analytical capabilities of one experimental technique alone , multi - method approaches ( e.g. combining scanning , diffraction and spectroscopic measurements ) have become an important tool in this field .",
    "in addition , first - principles calculations , almost exclusively employing density - functional theory ( dft ) , have played a key role in this research area , in particular when suitably combined with concepts from thermodynamics or statistical mechanics .",
    "although most of the arguments and understanding presented in this review are based on such calculations , i will not describe the methods themselves here , but refer to excellent monographs ( see for example refs . and ) for dft itself , to refs . and for applications to surfaces , and to ref . for the hybrid statistical mechanics methods .",
    "instead , this paper will focus on recent progress in the modeling and understanding of oxide formation of late tms , using particularly the late @xmath0 series from ru to ag to discuss trends .",
    "section ii will highlight aspects leading to the formation of surface oxides , especially on - surface adsorption and accommodation of oxygen in the sub - surface region .",
    "key factors ( also for the surface oxide stability itself ) are the bulk - oxide heat of formation , diffusion energy barriers , elastic strain energies , and the nature of the surface - oxide  metal interface .",
    "sometimes the nano- or sub - nanometer thickness of the formed oxide film is ruled by the thermodynamic conditions , but often the thickness is determined by kinetics , e.g. by the diffusion of metal or oxygen atoms ( between interface and surface ) , or by the on - going oxidation reaction at the surface in a catalytic environment .",
    "examples for both situations will be discussed in section iii , where we will also see that such thin oxide films can have a different structure to what is known from the stable bulk oxides . setting these results into a `` catalytic perspective '' , i will conclude in section iv , for example that the catalytic activity of ru in high - pressure oxidation reactions is likely due to nanometer thin , but nevertheless bulk - like oxide patches , whereas for pd and ag the catalysis is more likely actuated by novel , surface - confined sub - nanometer thin oxidic structures .",
    "oxide formation at metallic surfaces begins with the dissociation of the o@xmath2 molecule .",
    "this process is still not fully understood ( see for example ref . and references therein ) , but for the present review we do nt need to discuss this in detail . as the end product of the dissociation atomic oxygen is chemisorbed at highly coordinated surface sites .",
    "i will mainly address the lowest energy surfaces of the late @xmath0 tms which have the hcp(0001 ) geometry for ru , and the fcc(111 ) geometry for rh , pd , and ag .",
    "for these systems the oxygen adatoms occupy threefold hollow sites which are sketched in fig .",
    "[ sites ] .",
    "these two adsorbate positions , named hcp and fcc sites , differ only with respect to the second substrate layer : below the hcp hollow site there is a second - layer atom , and below the fcc hollow site there is none . in other words , these sites represent positions atoms would occupy , if the crystal were continued in a hcp or a fcc stacking sequence .",
    "interestingly , on the four @xmath0 materials covered in this paper , oxygen prefers initially those threefold hollow sites that correspond to the stacking type of the substrate , i.e. , the hcp hollow sites on ru and the fcc hollow sites on rh , pd , and ag . with increasing number of oxygen adatoms repulsive lateral interactions between the adsorbates",
    "lead to the formation of ordered superstructures , typically with a @xmath3 surface unit - cell at low coverages .",
    "then , depending on the material and whether higher coverage on - surface structures are formed at all , this may be followed by either @xmath4 or @xmath5 periodic overlayers , with oxygen atoms still occupying either hcp or fcc hollow sites .",
    "the quantity ruling the adsorption - site preference and the formation of ordered adlayers is the adatom binding energy : @xmath6   .",
    "\\label{bindeng}\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 is the total number of o atoms in the unit - cell at the considered coverage @xmath8 ( measured in monolayers , ml , i.e. the fraction compared to the number of first layer metal atoms ) .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the total energies of the adsorbate system , of the corresponding clean surface before adsorption , and of the isolated oxygen molecule .",
    "a positive binding energy @xmath12 reflects that the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath13 is exothermic .",
    "equation ( [ bindeng ] ) can be evaluated by dft , and for big systems this is in fact the only approach that is currently feasible and predictive .",
    "one has to stress , however , that for oxygen at transition metal surfaces such calculations are still demanding . without describing the technical challenges of performing such large - scale dft studies ,",
    "i only mention the basic problem : though dft is in principle exact , in practice it is not , because the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional is ( and probably ever will be ) only known approximately . for many systems",
    "this is not a severe problem , but for the o@xmath2 molecule even present - day gradient - corrected ( gga ) functionals suffer from a binding energy error of about 0.5ev per o atom .",
    "@xcite though some error cancellation will occur in eq .",
    "( [ bindeng ] ) , this o@xmath2 problem calls for caution when judging on the exo- or endothermicity of oxygen adsorption or oxide formation . binding energy _ differences _ between different adsorbate systems , for which the gas phase o@xmath2 problem cancels out at least partially , appear fortunately often much less affected by the xc approximation .",
    "still , caution is advisable , and if doubts exist , a regional xc correction , e.g. , following the approach of filippi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , may be necessary .    evaluating eq .",
    "( [ bindeng ] ) is most useful for identifying adsorption sites , lateral interactions or the saturation coverage , and by such calculations the interplay between theory and experiment has indeed been most stimulating and synergetic in this field .",
    "the atomic scale characterization of higher coverage o adsorbate layers forms already an intriguing example for this .",
    "although not really fully addressed and understood , it seems that the sticking coefficient for o@xmath2 drops either dramatically after a certain threshold coverage at the surface is reached ( ru , rh , pd ) or is very low from the beginning ( ag ) . particularly the sharp drop after reaching a coverage of about 0.5ml at ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) leads to an apparent uptake saturation , when employing low gas exposures as typical for many early ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) surface science studies.@xcite dft calculations predicted , however , that much higher coverages should still be possible @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ miraprl1 ] shows such data for some selected adsorbate configurations spanning the whole coverage range up to 1ml @xcite .",
    "although the decreasing binding energies with coverage indicate repulsive interactions between the adsorbed o atoms , they are still clearly exothermic up to the full ml for ru ( and also for rh ) . as for the o",
    "/ ru case adsorption into other sites ( e.g. below the surface ) or other structures can be ruled out ( see below ) , these results imply that energetically the formation of denser overlayers is possible , well beyond the apparent saturation at @xmath14ml . and",
    "in fact , by using more oxidizing gases that create higher partial pressures ( e.g. no@xmath2 ) , orders of magnitude higher o@xmath2 exposures ( sometimes millions of langmuirs ) or the more novel , direct _ in - situ _ studies at elevated pressures such overlayers ( and configurations corresponding to even much higher o uptakes ) are now routinely observed experimentally .",
    "one should stress , that on all four tm surfaces discussed in this paper , such experiments have opened a new door to study the oxidation beyond sub - monolayer overlayers in a controlled fashion , significantly improving the scientific understanding over the last years .",
    "figure [ miraprl1 ] also illustrates the mentioned o@xmath2-molecule problem . using in eq .",
    "( [ bindeng ] ) the _ experimental _",
    "o@xmath2 total energy , @xmath11 , instead of the theoretical one , would shift the energy zero to the upper dotted horizontal line .",
    "this is a too extreme alternative though , because some xc error also exists in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the true energy zero is probably somewhere in between the two dotted lines .",
    "obviously , in particular for silver the inaccuracy in the molecular binding requires special attention , even when only discussing the sign of the binding energy @xcite . what is , however , unambiguously evident from fig .",
    "[ miraprl1 ] is that the oxygen - metal bond strength decreases steadily from ru to ag , and this is in fact known qualitatively since long .",
    "the reason behind it is clearly visible in the projected density of states ( dos ) , which is defined as @xcite @xmath15 here @xmath16 are the kohn - sham orbitals , and @xmath17 is a properly chosen localized function , in the present case most suitably the ru @xmath0 and the o @xmath18 atomic orbitals within a sphere around given atomic sites .",
    "according to the anderson - grimley - newns model of chemisorption the interaction of the o @xmath18 level with the narrow @xmath0 band of the tm surface gives rise to bonding states at the lower edge of the @xmath19-band and antibonding states at the upper edge of the @xmath19 band .",
    "the corresponding peaks can be readily identified in fig .",
    "[ tmdos ] , illustrating the projected dos of a high coverage o adsorbate layer for the late @xmath0 tm series .",
    "the fermi level moves from the @xmath19-band center ( for ru it is already at a @xmath20% filling ) to about 3.5 ev above the top of the @xmath19 band ( for the noble metal ag ) , and thus the antibonding oxygen ",
    "metal states become progressively more and more occupied . @xcite as a consequence , the bond strength is weakened , explaining the steadily decreasing binding energies of fig .",
    "[ miraprl1 ] . for the discussion below , it is finally worthwhile mentioning that despite these large variations of the binding energy with element ( as well as with coverage ) , the oxygen - metal bond length does not change appreciably and stays always roughly at 2 .",
    "it is often assumed that deposition of oxygen on metal surfaces gives initially rise to stable overlayers ( either ordered or disordered ) .",
    "apparently this is often correct , but there is no reason that it holds in general .",
    "in fact , oxygen atoms may well go below the surface , either staying in the near - surface region or dissolving into the bulk . or , metal - oxide patches could form immediately .",
    "experimentally , very little is unfortunately still known about this . for the basal surfaces of the late @xmath0 transition metals recent dft - gga calculations",
    "indicate that initially oxygen adatoms stay at the surface , and only when the coverage exceeds a certain value some adatoms will go sub - surface.@xcite they then remain preferentially close to the surface , i.e. , they will not dissolve into the bulk.@xcite the interaction between these sub - surface oxygen atoms is attractive , and this situation may well already be called a surface oxide , or `` stage i '' of oxide formation .    in principle",
    ", oxygen may occupy interstitial or substitutional sites in the crystal , but mostly due to the high cohesive energy of the late tms the latter are found to be energetically much less favorable.@xcite thus , they will not play a role in thermodynamic equilibrium , or close to it , and we may focus our discussion on interstitial sites .",
    "directly below the topmost metal layer , i.e. in the immediate sub - surface region , there are three high - symmetry possibilities for such interstitial sites ( cf . fig .",
    "[ sites ] ) .",
    "namely , there is an octahedral site ( henceforth called octa ) and a tetrahedral site ( tetra - i ) directly below the on - surface fcc and hcp site , respectively . and there is a second tetrahedral site ( tetra - ii ) directly below a first layer metal atom .",
    "the main trends in the energetics of on- versus sub - surface oxygen are already discernible by comparing surface structures containing from one up to four o atoms in a model subset of @xmath3 unit - cells . of these up to four adatoms , consider that any one can be located either on- or below the surface in any of the high - symmetry sites displayed in fig . [ sites ] . despite the ostensible simplicity of this model subset ,",
    "the number of possible combinations of on- and sub - surface oxygen atoms in various site and symmetry configurations is still quite large , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ verosites ] by all configurations where one out of a total of four oxygen atoms is located below the surface .",
    "interestingly , from all these structural possibilities the combination of on - surface o in fcc sites and sub - surface o in tetra - i sites was in all four late @xmath0 metals found to be energetically either most stable or very close to the most stable geometry.@xcite    occupation of sub - surface sites will commence at a certain total coverage @xmath21 , when a structure with a non - zero fraction of the o atoms below the surface is energetically more favorable than the pure on - surface adsorption ( corresponding to a zero fraction of oxygen atoms below the surface ) .",
    "figure [ miraprl2 ] summarizes the energetics within the described model subset at the basal surface , and we see that for all four late @xmath0 tms on - surface adsorption is initially more favorable than sub - surface incorporation .",
    "however , with increasing coverage this picture changes as the aforedescribed repulsive lateral interactions between the on - surface oxygen atoms progressively diminish the preference for adsorption into these sites . as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ miraprl2 ] this threshold coverage @xmath21 , is beyond 1ml for ru and rh , i.e. oxygen incorporation will only start after completion of a full o@xmath22 overlayer , in nice agreement with experimental findings.@xcite close to @xmath23ml the energy differences are very small in the case of rh though .",
    "hence , a finite concentration of sub - surface oxygen might already be present at total coverages even slightly below 1ml at elevated temperatures.@xcite for pd , @xmath21 lies around 3/4ml , and for ag sub - surface incorporation starts almost immediately ( cf . fig . [ miraprl2 ] ) .",
    "this trend for sub - surface accommodation of oxygen atoms at the late @xmath0 tms can be understood by looking at the sub - surface geometries . in all relaxed structures",
    "the sub - surface oxygen - metal bond lengths are slightly larger than 2 , i.e. they are similar to the on - surface o  metal distances . comparing these bond lengths with the available geometrical space inside a frozen metal lattice , one finds them to be rather incompatible . for the unrelaxed tetra - i site of the late @xmath0 metals the bond length would range from 1.65  ( ru ) to 1.80  ( ag )",
    "thus , oxygen incorporation necessarily must go together with a substantial local expansion of the metal lattice . as shown by todorova _",
    "@xcite the bond strength of sub - surface oxygen atoms may therefore roughly be divided into a stabilizing contribution due to the chemical binding and a destabilizing contribution from the lattice deformation cost .",
    "going from ru to ag the first component should follow the same @xmath19-band - filling trend of the oxygen - metal bond strength that was discussed in section iia for on - surface oxygen . and",
    "also the latter component follows this trend , i.e. , it scales roughly as the bulk cohesive energy or the bulk modulus , which are largest for ru and smallest for ag as noted in fig .",
    "[ bulkmod ] .",
    "the two contributions ( o  metal bond strength and metal - lattice distortion energy ) have opposite sign and apparently roughly compensate each other , leading to a rather similar energetic stability of sub - surface oxygen in all four elements.@xcite    due to the lattice - deformation cost sub - surface oxygen turns out initially less favorable than on - surface adsorption , but with increasing coverage the repulsive lateral interactions for on - surface oxygen drive this preference down until eventually penetration of some oxygen adatoms becomes favorable .",
    "as the on - surface bond strength decreases from ru to ag , while the sub - surface bond strength stays roughly constant , this crossover will occur progressively earlier , i.e. @xmath21 is large for ru and small for ag .",
    "if oxygen penetrates , the deformation cost also rationalizes , why sub - surface incorporation was found to be more favorable compared to bulk dissolution . although the latter occurs of course always to some extent just on entropy grounds , there will at any rate be an enrichment of oxygen atoms in the easier to relax interstitial sites in the immediate near - surface fringe .",
    "and one could expect this deformation argument to hold even more for sub - surface sites close to even lower coordinated atoms , i.e. interstitials in the vicinity of point defects , steps or dislocations .",
    "the latter are in fact frequently believed to be _ the _ nucleation centers for surface oxide formation , and kinetic arguments like an easier o penetration are often put forward as explanation . yet , we see that the thermodynamic deformation cost factor could also favor an initial oxygen accommodation close to such sites .      thermodynamically the bulk oxide will start to form at the oxygen coverage , @xmath24 , at which the average oxygen binding energy , cf .",
    "( [ bindeng ] ) , equals the oxide heat of formation @xcite . the word `` coverage '' is used here in a wider sense , i.e. meaning the total amount of oxygen atoms in the near - surface region .",
    "interestingly , the just discussed @xmath21 for the initial incorporation of oxygen at sub - surface sites in the late @xmath0 metals does not only follow @xmath24 in trend , but also in approximate value @xcite .",
    "this suggests sub - surface oxygen as an intermediate , or a precursor , for the formation of the bulk oxide or other oxidic structures beyond on - surface adsorbate layers .",
    "recent experimental studies seem to support this view , i.e. , they indicate that thin oxidic structures , now mostly coined surface oxides , start to form roughly at coverages @xmath21.@xcite    for the `` true '' bulk oxide a higher oxygen concentration might be required , but for oxide nucleation and for the formation of oxidic islands such increased oxygen content is only needed locally . in this respect",
    "it is remarkable that although for the on - surface adsorption at the late @xmath0 tm basal surface the adatom - adatom interaction is repulsive ( see the discussion of fig .",
    "[ miraprl1 ] above ) , an attractive interaction was found for sub - surface oxygen atoms in ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ suboru ] , which shows the course of the average binding energy of o at ru(0001 ) upon increasing the amount of oxygen atoms between the first and second substrate layer up to 1ml sub - surface coverage , i.e. , 2 ml total coverage .",
    "as discussed in the last section , for ru(0001 ) oxygen penetration starts only after the full on - surface monolayer coverage is reached .",
    "up to @xmath23ml the binding energy decreases steadily due to the repulsive lateral interactions . for even higher coverages ,",
    "i.e. upon the ensuing filling of sub - surface sites , the binding energy curve exhibits an inflection .",
    "this implies overall attractive interactions that favor an accumulation of sub - surface oxygen in dense two - dimensional islands with a local @xmath22 periodicity.@xcite    while for ru(0001 ) @xcite and rh(111 ) @xcite the attractive interactions lead to dense oxygen islands with a local @xmath22 ordering below the surface , cf .",
    "[ suboru ] , at ag(111 ) it already becomes more favorable to incorporate oxygen rather between deeper layers , when a local sub - surface oxygen coverage of @xmath25ml is exceeded.@xcite apparently , each metal is only able to sustain a certain amount of oxygen per layer , and the differences between ru and ag are significant . whereas ru(0001 ) can accommodate a full oxygen monolayer on the surface plus a full oxygen monolayer below the top ru layer , for ag(111 ) this is only 25% of a monolayer on and 25% below the top ag layer .",
    "what seems to be a more general feature , however , is the o - metal - o trilayer type structure , that results from the accumulation of sub - surface oxygen below the topmost , oxygen - adsorbate covered metal layer .",
    "this accumulation will eventually lead to the formation of an ordered structure , which as already mentioned above , one could denote as a surface oxide , or `` stage i '' of oxide formation .",
    "this is to distinguish it from sub - surface oxygen , which often conveys more the notion of a randomly incorporated o species in the near - surface fringe .",
    "although we expect from the deformation cost argument an enrichment of the latter compared to bulk dissolved o , one should stress that an experimental identification of either ( bulk or sub - surface o ) species will be very difficult : the concentration of bulk dissolved o is thermodynamically quite low in the late @xmath0 tm crystal lattices @xcite and will thus only yield small signatures ( which as a note aside does not mean that the total amount of dissolved o in the whole crystal must be small though ) . and even though possibly enriched to a higher concentration , the signals from sub - surface o will also be small , since now only a small volume of the crystal will contribute .",
    "in fact , sub - surface oxygen has hitherto been quite elusive with only very few experimental studies claiming to have provided _",
    "evidence for it . what is more frequent is that spectroscopic features that could not otherwise be explained have been _ interpreted _ as being due to a sub - surface oxygen species .    within the deformation cost picture",
    ", it appears in any case rather likely that ( depending on the o exposure and kinetic barriers ) a ( lateral and vertical ) aggregation of sub - surface oxygen will directly lead to ordered surface oxide structures .",
    "we will see below , that these structures are indeed oxide precursors , which may often have a somewhat similar stoichiometry as the bulk oxides ( e.g. ruo@xmath2 and ag@xmath2o for the two mentioned trilayer structures , respectively ) , but the geometries can differ significantly .",
    "experimentally it may be similarly involved , though not impossible , to identify such structures , because also an ensuing transition to other oxidic precursors or eventually the `` true '' bulk oxide ( film ) may proceed fast",
    ".      continued accommodation of oxygen at the surface will eventually yield to the phase transition towards the `` true '' bulk oxide structure . for different materials",
    "this happens at different oxygen load , and the pathway from the first formed surface oxide to the final bulk oxide may well comprise other oxidic precursor structures .",
    "in general , one has to admit that our atomic - scale knowledge specific to this step in oxide formation is again very shallow . particularly for the more noble tms",
    "the low stability of the bulk oxides requires either very high oxygen pressures and/or rather low temperatures for the experimental preparation . at the lower temperatures the growth is largely affected by kinetic limitations though , so that at pd(111 ) at best small pdo clusters without apparent crystalline order were hitherto reported @xcite , while at ag(111 ) there exists literally no atomic - scale knowledge on the oxidation process beyond the formation of an ordered @xmath26 surface oxide ( see below )",
    "this situation is far better for ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) , where it is at least known that the oxidation process ends with the formation of crystalline rutile - structured ruo@xmath2(110 ) @xcite and corundum - structured rh@xmath2o@xmath27(0001 ) films @xcite , respectively .",
    "this detailed knowledge of both initial state ( the aforedescribed o - ru - o trilayer ) and final state ( the rutile structured ruo@xmath2(110 ) film ) made it possible to elaborate for the first time on an atomistic pathway for the structural phase transition towards the bulk oxide @xcite : if the oxygen load at the ru(0001 ) surface is increased beyond the 2ml coverage o - ru - o trilayer , cf .",
    "[ suboru ] , the surprising finding of the corresponding dft - gga study was that these additional oxygen atoms would also go preferentially between the first and second substrate layer , i.e. where already one full oxygen layer exists .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ float ] .",
    "it shows that a significant relaxation takes place such that the formed o - ru - o trilayer is essentially floating on an o / ru adsorbate system . with the trilayer decoupled ,",
    "increasing the oxygen load further then gives rise to two o - ru - o trilayers and so forth .",
    "still , this is not yet a know ru - oxide structure , neither with respect to the energy , nor the geometry .",
    "as the trilayer on top has apparently only negligible influence on the underlying metal , a continued exposure to oxygen is likely to produce sequentially more and more of these trilayers , which one after the other will become decoupled from the metal substrate .",
    "this way a loosely coupled stack of trilayers will successively be formed . comparing the geometry of these trilayers with the one of a rutile ( 110 ) layer",
    ", it can be noticed that the former can be transformed into the latter by a simple accordion - like lateral expansion of the trilayer as explained in fig .",
    "[ accordion ] . with this expansion",
    "the self - contained trilayer unfolds into a more open geometry , in which every second ru atom is undercoordinated compared to the ideal sixfold oxygen surrounding both offered in the trilayer and in bulk ruo@xmath13 .",
    "it is precisely these coordinatively unsaturated ( cus ) metal atoms that may eventually lead to a stabilization of the rutile structure for higher film thicknesses , as they can provide extra inter - layer bonds that can not be formed between the saturated trilayers . while for only one layer thick films the more compact trilayer offers therefore a more favorable configuration , this preference was already found reversed at a two layer thickness , eventually inducing the transition to rutile through the accordion - like expansion.@xcite    admittedly",
    ", this idealized pathway for one specific surface can barely be able to represent the complex atomic rearrangements and stoichiometry changes one can expect more generally during this oxidation step .",
    "still , it contains at least one aspect that appears quite crucial : the effect of strain . as already pointed out before",
    ", oxygen incorporation will always lead to a substantial local expansion of the crystal lattice of late @xmath0 tms , and known bulk oxide structures of the latter are accordingly much more open compared to the close - packed bulk metals . in the direction perpendicular to the surface",
    ", nothing opposes such an expansion and the corresponding vertical relaxations upon o incorporation can be quite substantial .",
    "lateral relaxations , on the other hand , will conflict with the binding of the formed oxidic fringe to the underlying metal lattice . in the formation of ( surface ) oxides ,",
    "the system therefore has to find an optimum energy compromise between elastic strain relaxation and good coupling to the underlying substrate .",
    "this may result in commensurable or incommensurable overlayers , and both types have already been observed experimentally on the late @xmath0 basal surfaces.@xcite in addition , strain may be easier relaxed at more open sites like steps , pointing again at the relevance of the latter for the oxidation process .",
    "apart from the strain energy , another influential factor is the thermodynamic driving force to form an oxide .",
    "the latter will roughly scale with the bulk oxide heat of formation , which steadily decreases from ruo@xmath2 to ag@xmath2o .",
    "the concomitant , lower stability of oxidic structures _",
    "per se _ , together with easier to deform metal lattices , might then render the coupling to the underlying substrate more important towards the more noble metals , i.e. the nature of the oxide - metal interface plays an increasing role . in this respect",
    "it is intriguing to notice that particularly at pd(111 ) and ag(111 ) pseudomorphic surface oxide structures have been reported , with a structure that seems particularly suited to maximize the interaction with the metal lattice below .",
    "a salient feature emerging from studies of the kind briefly sketched in the first part of this review is that the initial oxidation of late @xmath0 tms proceeds via few atomic - layer thin oxidic structures , the electronic and geometric structure of which may deviate significantly from their known bulk oxide counterparts .",
    "this makes these surface oxide films distinct to surfaces of both bulk metals and bulk oxides , and one is led to wonder whether they exhibit specific new properties that can be exploited for a desired functionality like catalysis . in this respect , one has to recognize , however , that in such applications ( and many experiments ) the actual thermodynamic variable is not the oxygen accommodation at the surface , but the partial pressures and temperature in the surrounding gas phase . instead of looking at the change of the state of the surface as e.g. a function of increased exposure ( or uptake ) as done in the preceding sections ,",
    "the relevant question to ask is then rather what happens to the tm surface given certain environmental conditions ?    exposed to an unlimited supply of gas phase particles characterized by the applied pressures and temperature , the surface will adapt on time scales set by the kinetic limitations .",
    "already these time scales could be sufficiently long to render corresponding metastable states interesting for applications .",
    "in fact , the classic example is a slow thickening of oxide films due to limitations in the diffusion of oxygen atoms from the surface to the oxide - metal interface , or in the diffusion of metal atoms from the interface to the surface.@xcite directly at the surface a similar bottleneck can be the penetration of oxygen , which might be significantly facilitated at steps and defects and thus adds to their relevance particularly for the formation of surface oxides also from a kinetic point of view . still , although such kinetic barriers might slow the oxidation process down beyond noticeable time scales , in a pure oxygen gas phase the true thermodynamic ground state will eventually be reached . with respect to oxide formation",
    "this is often loosely equated with a completely oxidized sample , and it thus came as quite a surprise that for the more noble @xmath0 tms dft - gga indicates that there are in fact @xmath1-conditions , for which a nanometer - thin surface oxide represents the thermodynamically stable phase .",
    "this means that in such environments a thin film is automatically formed at the oxidizing surface , the growth of which is self - limited to the potentially particularly interesting nanometer or sub - nanometer width .",

    "for the specific functionality in oxidation catalysis , one needs , however , also to assess the role played by the second reactant .",
    "although the average surface structure and composition is in catalysis even under steady - state conditions determined by the kinetics of the on - going elementary processes , it has been suggested that a thermodynamic approach with certain constraints could still provide a first insight into the effect of the reactive environment on the state of the catalyst surface.@xcite a straightforward generalization of the above described atomistic thermodynamics concept to a multi - component environment would be to account in eq .",

    "one should stress that the whole concept of a `` constrained equilibrium '' is not designed to yield precise answers to the microscopic state and reactivity of the catalyst surface . for that , the very dynamic behavior must be modeled by statistical mechanics , as will be illustrated below . yet , with atomistic thermodynamics the large scale behavior can be traced out first , possibly identifying those @xmath60-conditions where a more refined treatment explicitly accounting for kinetic effects is necessary .",
    "how this works in practice is nicely illustrated by comparing the stability range of the bulk oxides of the late @xmath0 tm series within the context of co oxidation catalysis , i.e. in a gas phase formed of oxygen and co.@xcite the progressively decreasing heats of formation of the more noble metal oxides already discussed in the last section are also clearly discernible in fig .

    "several phases involving the @xmath62 surface oxide are found to be most stable over a wide range of @xmath63-conditions that largely exceed the small stability range of bulk pdo .",
    "the range extends in fact so much that it even just comprises the gas phase conditions typical for technological co oxidation , i.e. partial pressures of the order of 1atm and temperatures around 300 - 600k .",

    "second , kinetic effects could significantly affect the oxidation state of the surface .",
    "this is the case , when the on - going catalytic reaction consumes surface species faster than they can be replenished from the surrounding gas phase , thus yielding an average surface structure and composition that can be quite distinct to the predictions obtained within the constrained equilibrium concept .",

    "the constrained equilibrium description discussed up to now conveys the impression that a possible oxidation of the catalyst surface in the o - rich environments of oxidation catalysis would rather yield bulk - like thick oxide films on ru , but thin surface oxide structures on the more noble @xmath0 metals .",
    "this reflects the decreasing heat of formation of the bulk oxides over the late tm series , and seems to suggest that it is primarily at pd and ag where oxide formation in the reactive environment could be self - limited to nanometer or sub - nanometer thin overlayers . particularly for the case of ru ,",
    "[ bulkoxidestab ] shows that the gas phase conditions typical for technological co oxidation catalysis fall deep inside the stability regime of the bulk oxide , indicating that thermodynamically nothing should prevent a continued growth of the once formed oxide film .",
    "the formation of crystalline , bulk - like ruo@xmath2(110 ) during high - pressure co oxidation catalysis has indeed been observed experimentally at ru(0001 ) , but it is interesting to note that even after long operation times the film thicknesses never exceeded about 20 @xcite .",
    "generally , one could interpret this finding as reflecting kinetic limitations to a continued growth , presumably due to slow diffusion of either o or ru atoms through the formed film.@xcite while this could slow the thickening of the oxide overlayer down beyond hitherto measured time scales , it could also be that the kinetics of the on - going catalytic reaction affect the surface populations in such a way , that no further net diffusion through the film occurs and the nanometer thin oxide overlayer represents in fact a kinetically limited steady - state in the given reactive environment",
    ". this would e.g. be the case , if the oxidation reactions at the surface consume adsorbed oxygen atoms at such a pace that on average o penetration into the film occurs not more frequently than the filling of surface sites with oxygen from inside the film .    to explore this in more detail one",
    "needs to go beyond the constrained equilibrium description and explicitly take kinetic effects into account in the theoretical modeling .",
    "this can for example be achieved via kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations , which can essentially be viewed as coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations , following the time evolution of the system on the basis of the rates of all individual elementary processes occurring in the system.@xcite evaluating the statistical interplay between this manifold of atomic - scale processes , kmc simulations can easily cover sufficiently long time scales to arrive at proper averages of quantities like surface populations , even if the system is not in equilibrium , but only in a steady - state as typical for catalysis .",
    "such a modeling was recently performed for the co oxidation over ruo@xmath2(110 ) , using dft - gga based rates for 26 elementary surface processes including adsorption , desorption , diffusion and reaction events.@xcite of particular interest for the film thickness issue is the occupation of surface sites with o atoms in catalytically relevant gas environments . in this respect ,",
    "the ruo@xmath2(110 ) surface offers two prominent adsorption sites , commonly denoted as bridge ( br ) and coordinatively unsaturated ( cus ) sites as explained in fig .",
    "[ ruo2_sites].@xcite    figure [ orukmc ] shows the obtained steady - state average surface populations at @xmath64k as a function of the gas - phase partial pressures , together with the simultaneously computed turnover frequencies ( tof , in units of formed co@xmath2 per @xmath65 per second ) . the latter result from evaluating the average occurrence of the reaction events over long time periods as a measure of the catalytic activity , and",
    "are intriguingly peaked around a narrow range of gas phase conditions .",
    "contrary to the situation at most other partial pressures , the site occupation at br and cus sites is then not dominated by one species , i.e. either o or co ( or vacant ) .",
    "instead , the kinetics builds up a surface population in which o and co compete for either site type at the surface .",
    "this competition is in fact nicely reflected by the huge fluctuations in the surface populations with time apparent in fig .",
    "[ oruoccupation ] .",
    "the dynamics at the surface in this `` active state '' is furthermore extremely fast , and the average time adsorbed o atoms stay in br or cus sites before desorbing or being reacted away is only of the order of fraction of milliseconds .",
    "remarkably , it is particularly the concentration of o at the surface that turns out significantly lower than predicted within the constrained equilibrium approach @xcite . even at the bridge sites , where o atoms bind very strongly @xcite , the o occupation is only 90% and not 100% as in the normally stable surface termination",
    "this is quite surprising , and indicates already how effectively the on - going reaction consumes surface o species .",
    "it could therefore well be that the surface kinetics indeed limits a continued growth of the formed oxide film under this optimum catalytic performance .",
    "the partial pressures and temperatures leading to this high activity state of the ruo@xmath2(110 ) surface in the calculations , and even the absolute tof values under these conditions , agree extremely well with detailed experimental studies measuring the steady - state activity in the temperature range from 300 - 600k and both at high - pressures and in uhv @xcite .",
    "this statement comprises already the emerging consensus that this ru oxide also forms at the surface of ru model catalysts in high - pressure environments @xcite , i.e. the high activity that was originally ascribed to the ru substrate was in fact due to ruo@xmath2 @xcite . with this understanding a puzzle",
    "is finally resolved that had bothered surface scientists for quite a while : for a long time the high co oxidation reactivity of supported ru catalysts @xcite , as well as of ru(0001 ) single crystals @xcite at high - pressures stood in sharp contrast to exceedingly low turnover rates observed under uhv conditions @xcite , thus representing a nice example of a so - called `` pressure gap '' system @xcite .",

    "[ miraprl1 ] conform much better with the widespread use of these metals in catalytic car converters , whereas the oxygen bonding at ru(0001 ) seems simply too strong .",

    "the subsequently established @xcite and above described high activity of this oxide surface then not only explained the pressure gap difference ( ru metal in uhv = low activity , ruo@xmath13 at high - pressures = high activity ) , but also reconciled this system with the sabatier principle : the ruo@xmath13(110 ) surface indeed features oxygen species that are bound with intermediate bond strength comparable to the one of o at rh(111 ) and pd(111).@xcite    an equivalent , though reverse explanation has also been suggested for the most noble of the late @xmath0 metals.@xcite according to fig .",

    "[ miraprl1 ] : both the too strong o binding on ru and the too weak o binding on ag is alleviated by the formation of oxides , which exhibit a similarly intermediate bond strength as oxygen at rh or pd .",
    "it thus almost appears as if the interaction of oxygen with tm catalysts would serve to `` tune '' the o - metal bond strength for optimum reactivity through an appropriate amount of surface oxidation .",
    "since the thermal stability of bulk ag@xmath2o is already too low and in line with our preceding extended stability discussion , this oxidation can at ag at best correspond to the formation of a thin surface oxide though .",
    "yet , compared to the surface oxides at pd , even the latter is probably not stable enough to play an active role in co oxidation .",
    "this can be different in the less reducing environments of partial oxidation reactions , consistent with the predominant use of ag catalysts for ethylene epoxidation or formaldehyde synthesis @xcite .",
    "these examples underline therefore already nicely the potential relevance of surface oxidation in the reactive surroundings of oxidation catalysis . in all cases discussed so far ,",
    "this had a beneficial effect on the overall catalytic performance , but detrimental effects due to the formation of an inactive oxide film are of course equally well conceivable .",
    "such a catalyst deactivation through oxidation has e.g. been frequently suspected in the experimental literature concerning rh surfaces.@xcite in other cases , the catalytic activity of oxide and metal surface might be comparable , so that surface oxidation would likely remain unnoticed unless explicitly looked for by experimental techniques sensitive to the atomic - scale .",
    "novel experimental and theoretical approaches addressing the effect of realistic environments on surface structure and composition have significantly increased the atomic - scale understanding of the oxide formation process of late transition metals over the last years .",
    "some identified key features have been reviewed for the late @xmath0 sequence from ru to ag , and are summarized schematically again in fig .",
    "[ oxischematic ] : a progressively more o - rich gas phase leads first to on - surface adsorption , followed by o penetration into the surface at increasing o accommodation .",
    "the incorporation takes place after the formation of dense oxygen overlayers in the case of ru , but already at lower on - surface coverages towards the more noble metals .",
    "this results from the opposing trends in decreasing o - metal bond strength and decreasing deformation cost of the metal lattice , the latter being a consequence of the substantial local expansion necessarily connected to o incorporation into the close - packed tm lattices .",
    "the deformation cost is also responsible for an enrichment of oxygen in the easier to relax immediate surface fringe , eventually inducing the formation of thin oxidic structures at the surface .",
    "although some bulk dissolution will always occur on entropy grounds , there is thus primarily a propensity to form few atomic - layer thin surface oxides , which mostly goes hand in hand with substantial structural changes .",
    "the resulting geometry is then not only characterized by an optimum binding within the more open compound structure , but can also be largely affected by the coupling to the underlying metal substrate ( i.e. the nature of the oxide - metal interface ) and residual strain . as consequence ,",
    "complex atomic arrangements not resembling surfaces of bulk oxides or bulk metals have been reported for this step in the oxidation process . only after continued oxygen accommodation",
    ", the thickening oxide film will eventually switch to a bulk oxide structure , and the continued film growth will then be more and more limited by the slow diffusion of o and/or metal atoms between surface and interface .",
    "a most intriguing aspect of this surface oxidation is that it proceeds via the few atomic - layer thin surface oxide structures .",

    "<S> if metal surfaces are exposed to sufficiently oxygen - rich environments , oxides start to form . </S>",
    "<S> important steps in this process are the dissociative adsorption of oxygen at the surface , the incorporation of o atoms into the surface , the formation of a thin oxidic overlayer and the growth of the once formed oxide film . for the oxidation process of late transition metals ( tm ) , recent experimental and theoretical studies provided a quite intriguing atomic - scale insight : the formed initial oxidic overlayers are not merely few atomic - layer thin versions of the known bulk oxides , but can exhibit structural and electronic properties that are quite distinct to the surfaces of both the corresponding bulk metals and bulk oxides . if such nanometer or even sub - nanometer surface oxide films are stabilized in applications , new functionalities not scalable from the known bulk materials could correspondingly arise </S>",
    "<S> . this can be particularly important for oxidation catalysis , where technologically relevant gas phase conditions are typically quite oxygen - rich . </S>",
    "<S> in such environments surface oxides may even form naturally in the induction period , and actuate then the reactive steady - state behavior that has traditionally been ascribed to the metal substrates . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding aspects are reviewed by focusing on recent progress in the modeling and understanding of the oxidation behavior of late tms , using particularly the late @xmath0 series from ru to ag to discuss trends . </S>"
