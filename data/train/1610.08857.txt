    "a hint to this conundrum may lie in the dependence of area per lipid ( apl ) and bilayer thickness ( @xmath162 ) ( figs.[apl_and_d_hh]a , b ) .",
    "in the range of @xmath163 mol% , the apl increases from 55 @xmath43 to @xmath11 64 @xmath43 ( fig.[apl_and_d_hh]a ) , whereas @xmath162 decreases from 41.7   to 38.2   ( fig.[apl_and_d_hh]b ) @xcite , a change that could effectively be induced by applying a lateral tension to the bilayer .",
    "although the measurements were done on multilamellar structure of dppc , electron density profile across bilayer @xcite reported a decrease of bilayer thickness due to dmso .",
    "they reported 16 % decrease of bilayer thickness from 3.79 nm to 3.16 nm in 35 wt% ( @xmath164 11 mol% ) dmso after subtracting the contribution of sulfur atom of dmso trapped in bilayer headgroup from the electron density profile , and the extent of decreases in bilayer thickness is even greater than our result ( 3.82 nm/4.17 nm @xmath164 8 % ) .",
    "other studies @xcite , again on multilamellar structure , argue the constant bilayer thickness up to @xmath165 , contradicting to the conclusion of the above - mentioned electron density profile study @xcite .",
    "compared with bilayer stacked in gel phase , a certain amount of cosolvent deposition into bilayer in fluid phase is physically more plausible .",
    "thus , it appears that the issue of how dmso ( @xmath166 ) affects the bilayer thickness , especially for fluid phase unilamellar structure , remains inconclusive .",
    "while a possibility of an imperfect force field can not completely be ruled out , our simulation study straightforwardly indicates the increase ( decrease ) of apl ( @xmath162 ) of `` unilamellar '' bilayers in the fluid phase ( fig.[apl_and_d_hh]a , b ) .    ) , at various dmso concentrations .",

    "[ apl_and_d_hh ] ]    the amount of dmso deposited below the headgroup ( @xmath135  ) increases with @xmath0 ( fig.[apl_and_d_hh]c ) , providing more free space between lipids , increasing apl ; thus contributing to the enhancement of water diffusivity around the tempo buried below the bilayer surface ( fig.[dsurf_vs_dbulk]a ) .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of the escape time of dmso trapped below the bilayer surface on @xmath0 is also noteworthy ( fig.[apl_and_d_hh]d ) .",
    "the first decrease of the mean escape time to the surface ( @xmath156 % ) may well be an outcome of the increased apl , but the next increase of the mean escape time for @xmath168 % could be related to the increase of @xmath0 while the apl is already saturated ( fig.[apl_and_d_hh]a ) .",
    "while it is not clear how significant the contribution of the increase ( decrease ) of apl ( @xmath162 ) with @xmath0 is to the dehydration from the solvent - bilayer interface , the increase of apl is certainly a relevant factor that enhances the diffusivity of water in the interior of bilayers . +    .",

    "the results summarized in fig.[fig_lipid_n_water_dmso ] underscore three points : ( 1 ) the pair correlation between water and the choline group ( nitrogen atom ) at bilayer surfaces shows an increase in the 1st solvation shell with increasing @xmath0 ( fig.[fig_lipid_n_water_dmso]a ) ; ( 2 ) the number of water molecules surrounding a pc group decreases with increasing @xmath0 ( fig.[fig_lipid_n_water_dmso]a , inset ) ; ( 3 ) the lifetime of water in the 1st solvation shell around a choline group increases with @xmath0 and is an order of magnitude greater than that around tma@xmath9 in the bulk phase ( fig.[fig_lipid_n_water_dmso]b ) .",

    "* effects of sucrose on surface water . * in order to assure that dmso effect on water as a cryoprotectant is specific , we also studied the effect of another cosolvent , sucrose , on surface water .",
    "first , differences of sucrose from dmso are clear from the density profiles calculated for water and sucrose .",
    "the water density starts to deviate from the bulk value farther away from the solvent - bilayer interface ( fig.[sucrose]a ) , resulting in a greater interface width ( greater value of @xmath171 .",
    "see fig.[xi_tetrahedral]a ) .",
    "an increase of the cosovlent concentration changes the interface width in opposite direction as compared to dmso ; @xmath171 increases with the sucrose concentration ( @xmath172 ) , whereas it decreases with @xmath0 ( fig.[xi_tetrahedral]a ) .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to dmso solution , a water rich layer is no longer observed in sucrose solution even at high @xmath172 ( fig.[xi_tetrahedral]a ) , and sucrose molecules accumulates on the bilayer surface ( fig.[sucrose]b ) .",
    "importantly , @xmath173 indicates that the tetrahedral structure of the water h - bond network @xcite is better preserved in sucrose than in dmso solution ( compare fig.[sucrose]c with fig.[fig_dmso]d , or see fig.[xi_tetrahedral]b ) , suggesting that dmso is a better cryoprotectant .",
    "next , the local diffusivity profiles of water in the sucrose solution show qualitative difference from those in dmso solution . in the sucrose solution ,",
    "both @xmath174 and @xmath175 decrease monotonically from the bulk to bilayer , and the water diffusivity hump is no longer observed ( figs.[sucrose]d , e , f ) .",
    "furthermore , unlike dmso solutions , the diffusivity profiles @xmath175 collapse onto a single curve in sucrose solution ( fig.[sucrose]f ) .",
    "the qualitatively different effects of dmso and sucrose on the surface water dynamics are highlighted by plotting the surface - to - bulk ratio of water diffusion constant , @xmath176 as a function of @xmath172 ( fig.[dmso_diffusivity]a ) where @xmath177 was calculated at @xmath101  . while @xmath178 does not change with increasing @xmath172 , an increase of @xmath179 with @xmath0 is evident ( fig.[dmso_diffusivity]a ) .",
