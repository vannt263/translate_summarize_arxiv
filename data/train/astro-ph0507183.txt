    "after the combination of protons and electrons at redshift @xmath14 the hydrogen content of the universe remained largely neutral for some time .",
    "observations of high - redshift quasars show that the neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) became fully reionized by @xmath15 ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the standard picture ( e.g. barkana & loeb 2001 )",
    "this reionization was the result of a rapid rise in the production of hydrogen - ionizing photons due to the birth of the first sizable population of stars and accreting black holes .",
    "a census of the star - forming galaxy population at @xmath16 is now possible due to deep optical surveys carried out by the ( dickinson et al 2004 ; bunker et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ) . whilst the luminosity function of these galaxies is now fairly well constrained ( bunker et al .",
    "2004 ) , translating this to the uv ionizing photon production rate relies upon a couple of uncertain factors : the spectral shape shortward of ly@xmath7  ( which depends upon the stellar initial mass function and metallicity ) and the fraction of ionizing photons which escape the host galaxy .",
    "therefore the ionizing photon production rate of the star - forming galaxy population remains quite uncertain and it is not clear whether this rate is high enough to reionize the universe at @xmath5 ( stiavelli , fall & panagia 2004 ) .",
    "an alternative source of ionizing photons is the quasar population .",
    "quasars have very hard spectra which makes them extremely efficient ionizing sources .",
    "it is possible that the earliest phases of reionization at @xmath17 were carried out by low - mass accreting black holes also known as ` mini - quasars ' ( madau et al .",
    "the @xmath5 quasar luminosity function is much more poorly constrained than the @xmath5 galaxy luminosity function and consequently the quasar ionizing photon output is very poorly known .",
    "the only quasars known at this redshift are from the bright sloan digital sky survey ( fan et al .",
    "2004 and refs therein ) and these luminous quasars make up only a tiny fraction of the total quasar luminosity density .",
    "the bulk of the luminosity density is emitted by quasars close to the ` break ' in the luminosity function .",
    "attempts to constrain the high - redshift quasar ionizing photon output have therefore largely depended upon extrapolation of the sdss quasar space density to lower luminosities using parameters derived for the luminosity function at lower redshifts ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ; yan & windhorst 2004 ; meiksin 2005 ) .",
    "this necessarily involves large and uncertain extrapolations .",
    "these studies show that , for the _ expected _ values of the luminosity function parameters , quasars fall short of producing enough ionizing photons for reionization . however , there is considerable debate as to how many photons are necessary for reionization since there is a large uncertainty in the clumpiness of the igm which controls the importance of recombinations ( madau , haardt & rees 1999 ; haiman , abel & madau 2001 ; oh & haiman 2003 ; iliev , shapiro & raga 2005 ; meiksin 2005 ) .",
    "dijkstra , haiman & loeb ( 2004 ) presented a novel method to constrain the quasar contribution to reionization by considering the unresolved component of the soft x - ray background .",
    "they found that , for their adopted quasar spectral shape between the uv and hard x - rays and clumpiness of the igm , @xmath5 quasars can not provide enough photons to reionize the universe at @xmath18 significance .",
    "meiksin ( 2005 ) discussed this soft x - ray background constraint and showed that adjusting either the typical quasar spectral shape or clumping factor within reasonable ranges produced a result consistent with reionization at @xmath5 by quasars .",
    "current constraints on the @xmath5 quasar luminosity function also depend heavily on the properties of sdss quasars .",
    "the luminosity distribution has been used to place a @xmath18 range on the bright - end slope of @xmath19 ( fan et al .",
    "the lack of strong gravitational lensing amongst the sdss sample can also place a constraint on @xmath20 ( e.g. wyithe & loeb 2002 ; comerford , haiman & schaye 2002 ) .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that this leads to a constraint in the range @xmath21 to @xmath22 at @xmath18 significance depending upon the assumed values for the break magnitude and faint - end slope .",
    "wyithe ( 2004 ) combined sdss lensing constraints and the luminosity distribution of fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to find that @xmath23 at 90% confidence .",
    "however , using the steeper slope preferred by the luminosity distribution of the expanded sample of fan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) would have the effect of weakening the conclusion of wyithe ( 2004 ) .",
    "a search for lower luminosity quasars at @xmath24 in the chandra deep field - north found one quasar at @xmath25 but none at higher redshift ( barger et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the canada - france high-@xmath26 quasar survey ( cfhqs ) utilises the wide - area deep surveys now being undertaken at the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope with the 1 degree field - of - view camera megacam . in this paper we present the method for selecting @xmath27 quasars and our initial results .",
    "the data used in this paper represent a very small fraction of the full area / depth that is planned .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec.2",
    "we discuss the expected optical / near - ir colours of point sources ( quasars and stars ) as observed with megacam and the near - ir camera cfht - ir .",
    "in sec.3 we describe the optical and near - ir datasets and the search for high - redshift quasars . in sec.4",
    "we discuss the limits on the high - redshift quasar luminosity function which result from our work .",
    "sec.5 addresses whether @xmath16 quasars can produce enough uv photons to reionize the universe .",
    "cosmological parameters of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are assumed throughout .",
    "the sharp drop in flux across the ly@xmath7  emission line in high redshift quasars makes colour selection the most efficient method for selecting quasars over large areas ( e.g. richards et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this technique has been successfully utilised in the sdss to discover all of the highest redshift quasars currently known ( fan et al .",
    "spatially unresolved sources with @xmath31 in the sdss system are either quasars at @xmath27 or brown dwarfs .",
    "the filter transmission profiles and ccd sensitivity for megacam are not identical to those of the sdss . therefore to determine the optimum colour selection criteria for high - redshift quasars with cfht",
    ", we have performed simulations of the expected colours of quasars in the cfht filters .",
    "previous methods to simulate the colours of high - redshift quasars have used composite quasar spectra or power - law + emission line spectra as the input quasar template . to obtain a realistic spread in quasar properties , we use the observed spectra of a sample of @xmath32 quasars to simulate the colours of quasars at higher redshift .",
    "a similar method has recently been presented by chiu et al .",
    "however , their analysis was for the sdss filters and differed from ours in several aspects , so we outline our method in detail here .    since our high redshift quasar selection is based on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 filters , we require optical quasar spectra which sample the rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath35 quasars in these filters .",
    "this wavelength range can be achieved with the sdss dr3 spectroscopy of quasars at @xmath36 . at these redshifts",
    ", there is very little colour incompleteness in the sdss , due to the fact that the quasar colours lie far from the stellar locus ( richards et al .",
    "this is important since we are using these quasars to assess the efficiency of our own colour selection criteria .",
    "there are 180 quasars in the dr3 catalogue satisfying these criteria . the lack of evolution in quasar spectra from @xmath5 to lower redshift ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ) justifies our use of lower redshift templates .",
    "we assume the range of emission line strengths , broad absorption line occurrence and spectral shapes of the @xmath37 quasars are representative of the @xmath5 quasar population .",
    "the only significant difference between the rest - frame uv spectra of @xmath37 and @xmath5 quasars is the much stronger hi absorption at higher redshift .",
    "therefore the spectra of the @xmath37 quasars need to have their lyman forest absorption properties changed to be consistent with being located at a higher redshift .",
    "the lyman forest absorption over the redshift range @xmath38 has recently been studied using high - resolution spectroscopy by songaila ( 2004 ) .",
    "the mean transmission for ly@xmath7  as a function of redshift is taken from their eqn .",
    "this relation only applies at @xmath39 , so the lower redshift transmission was determined by fitting to the data tabulated in that paper .",
    "the ly@xmath20optical depth was determined using @xmath40 as found by songaila .",
    "first of all it is necessary to statistically correct for the ly@xmath7  and ly@xmath20  absorption already present in the spectra of the @xmath37 quasars .",
    "ly@xmath41  and higher order absorption are not considered since they have a very small effect on the flux integrated over any of our filters at any redshift .",
    "we also set all flux below the quasar lyman limit to zero .",
    "after correcting for the lower redshift absorption , absorption at higher redshifts assuming the quasar is located at @xmath35 is applied . for each @xmath37 quasar",
    ", we introduce scatter in the lyman forest absorption as a function of redshift ( assuming the quasar lies at @xmath35 ) .",
    "the amount of scatter in @xmath42 bins is estimated as a function of redshift from the observations of songaila ( 2004 ) .    to determine the colours of quasars in our filters we convolve the 180 simulated quasar spectra with the @xmath33 ( megacam ) and @xmath34 ( cfht - ir ) filters .",
    "the filter profiles include the effect of ccd quantum efficiency and atmospheric transmission .",
    "all magnitudes are determined on the ab system .",
    "note this is different from the @xmath27 quasar survey in the sdss where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are on the ab system , but @xmath34 is on the vega system .",
    "the colours are determined for a range of redshifts from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "we also ran the simulated quasar spectra through the sdss filter system to determine the sdss colours of our quasar templates .",
    "we found good agreement between the simulated @xmath45 colours as a function of redshift and the observed colours of the 12 @xmath27 sdss quasars .",
    "this provides a check on our lyman forest absorption technique since the @xmath45 colours are particularly sensitive to this absorption .",
    "the @xmath45 vs @xmath46 diagram is shown in fig.[fig : colcolsimul ] .",
    "the colours of all 180 simulated quasars are plotted as a function of redshift from @xmath43 at lower - left to @xmath44 at upper - right .",
    "note the tracks of the quasars in colour - colour space follow a similar trend to that shown for a simulated quasar in the sdss system in fan et al .",
    "however , there is a significant difference .",
    "the sdss @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters are not overlapping , whereas there is a small , but significant , overlap for the megacam filters . the effect of this overlap is to decrease the @xmath45 colours of quasars , particularly in the range @xmath47 where the ly@xmath7  line passes through the overlap region .",
    "therefore we need to adopt a lower @xmath45 selection criteria than the @xmath48 used by the sdss if we are to select quasars at similar redshifts . the box bounded by the regions",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 defines the default colour - colour high - redshift quasar selection criteria .",
    "it can be seen from inspection of the figure that these criteria select almost all quasars in the range @xmath51 .    to determine the quasar selection efficiency as a function of redshift more quantitatively ,",
    "we have determined the fraction of quasars as a function of redshift which fall within this box . to account for the fact that the colours of objects detected in ccd imaging have a photometric uncertainty we model the location of each quasar at each redshift in colour - colour space as a 2d gaussian probability density distribution with @xmath52 .",
    "this error in colours is typical for the faintest sources in our survey ( sec.[nir ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the fraction of the probability that falls within the selection region .",
    "this process is repeated for three different @xmath45 cuts of @xmath53 and @xmath54 to determine the effect of imposing different colour cuts on the selection efficiency as a function of redshift .",
    "the results of this process are shown in fig.[fig : colcomp ] .",
    "quasars can be selected over the redshift range @xmath55 at a completeness fraction of @xmath56 .",
    "the completeness is close to unity at @xmath51 .",
    "the effect of imposing a stricter cut of @xmath57 or 1.7 is fairly small and only has an impact at the lower end of the redshift range ( up to @xmath58 ) . +      to determine the colours of ultracool stars ( m , l and t dwarfs ) in our filters we convolve observed spectra obtained from sandy leggett s online database  with the @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( mega cam ) and @xmath34 ( cfht - ir ) filters .",
    "only stars without significant gaps in spectral coverage at the wavelengths of these filters were used .",
    "the spectra are from the following sources : tsvetanov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , burgasser et al . ( 2000 ) , kirkpatrick et al . ( 2000 ) , reid et al . (",

    "( 2002 ) and knapp et al .",
    "fig.[fig : colcolsimul ] shows the dwarf colours as plus signs ( m ) , triangles ( l ) and asterisks ( t ) .",
    "a sequence is also plotted by binning the dwarfs by type and evaluating the median colour in each bin .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the @xmath45 vs @xmath46 diagram provides a very clean separation between quasars and brown dwarfs for @xmath591.3 .",
    "the @xmath60 selection criteria which we adopt nominally selects dwarfs cooler than l2/l3 . with significant noise in our colours and the much larger population of late - m dwarfs in a flux - limited sample ,",
    "a significant number of slightly warmer stars may be _ observed _ to have @xmath60 .",
    "in this paper we use optical imaging from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls )  to search for high - redshift quasars . the data used come from the first official release : t0001 .",
    "this release includes data in the four deep survey fields obtained during the period june 2003 - july 2004 .",
    "the deep survey has a 5-year lifetime , so the final dataset will go @xmath61mag deeper than the data used in this paper .",
    "full details of this dataset are available elsewhere , but here we summarise the details relevant to our quasar search .",

    "the magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that stars may not lie behind the total galactic obscuring column , but since the main goal of this paper is quasar selection and the applied galactic extinction corrections are smaller than our photometric errors , we do not attempt any further corrections for stars .    from these catalogues we drew a sample of objects satisfying the colour criterion of eqn .",

    "even at bright magnitudes , about 5% of sources are not recovered because they overlap with other objects or regions affected by bright stars .",
    "we note that this fraction is much lower than the @xmath170 of the area in the mask region file released by terapix .",
    "we find their masking to be much too conservative for our purpose .",
    "by @xmath171 the recovered fraction has decreased to @xmath172 in all the images . for each field",
    "we determine the area in which sources can be found as a function of their magnitude . at bright magnitudes the total area surveyed",
    "is 3.83 sq deg , dropping to 3.32 sq deg . at our limit of @xmath173 .",
    "the colour selection criteria were discussed extensively with simulated quasar and stellar colours in sec.[simulq ] . here",
    "we recap these selection criteria and evaluate the extent to which colour selection impacts our completeness .",
    "the nominal colour selection criteria are @xmath60 and @xmath174 .",
    "no observed objects lie within this box .",
    "since we were unable to observe all the candidates with @xmath144 down to the magnitude limit , our completeness level in terms of the @xmath45 colour varies from field - to - field .",
    "field d1 is complete to @xmath60 , d2 and d3 are complete to @xmath175 and d4 is complete to @xmath57 .",
    "note that even though only two out of eleven candidates in d3 were observed , all the unobserved objects have @xmath176 .",
    "fig.[fig : colcomp ] showed the completeness due to colour cuts as determined from the simulated high - redshift quasar colours .",
    "the effect of implementing redder cuts than the nominal @xmath60 is to exclude quasars in the range @xmath177 .",
    "the completeness at @xmath178 is @xmath179 and @xmath180 for @xmath181 and @xmath54 , respectively . at @xmath58 ,",
    "the colour completeness for all three cuts are @xmath182 .",
    "therefore using a redder cut in @xmath45 makes only a very small difference to our sensitivity to quasars across the full range of @xmath51 .",
    "this means that we can include fields like d2 and d3 which have not been so well followed up in the near - infrared whilst losing only a small amount in the completeness of high - redshift quasar selection .",
    "the magnitude and colour completenesses are combined to generate an effective volume of our high - redshift quasar survey as a function of redshift ( over the interval @xmath51 ) and absolute magnitude .",
    "absolute magnitudes of the quasar continuum at a rest - frame wavelength of 1450  are calculated for the possible range of apparent @xmath1-band magnitudes .",
    "these calculations use @xmath183-corrections generated from the mean @xmath183-corrections of the 180 redshifted @xmath32 quasars discussed in sec.[simulq ] .",
    "we now use the non - detection of high - redshift quasars in the cfhtls deep fields to constrain the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "we parametrise the lf using the double power - law form that provides a good fit at lower redshift ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) , i.e. @xmath184 the luminosity distribution of sdss @xmath15 quasars from fan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is used to fit the bright - end normalisation @xmath185 as a function of the bright - end slope @xmath20 . taking the range in @xmath20 allowed by the sdss and the value of @xmath185 at each @xmath20",
    ", we set up an array of possible double - power - law lfs .",
    "the faint - end slope @xmath7 will not be strongly constrained by our data and therefore we do not treat this as a free parameter .",
    "instead we assume that @xmath7 takes a value of @xmath186 or @xmath187 and repeat our analysis for each of these values .",
    "the best - fit values at the highest redshifts at which @xmath7 has been measured ( @xmath188 ) lie in the range @xmath189 to @xmath190 ( boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; croom et al . 2004 ; hunt et al .",
    "2004 ; richards et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we will consider the effect of @xmath7 later on .",
    "sec.[complete ] discussed our survey volume as a function of redshift and absolute magnitude .",
    "we use the array of possible lfs combined with the survey volume to calculate the number of @xmath51 quasars @xmath191 that we would expect to have discovered in our survey as a function of @xmath20 and break magnitude @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of not finding any quasars given this lf is then simply given by the poisson probability @xmath192 .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in fig.[fig : lfparam ] .",
    "curves are plotted at confidence levels of @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "separate panels show the different results obtained by assuming faint - end slopes of @xmath195 . since our survey is only sensitive to quasars brighter than @xmath196 , our constraints depend weakly on @xmath7 unless the break magnitude is very bright ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the evolution in the 2df quasar lf is fit by pure - luminosity evolution with the break evolving from @xmath198 at @xmath199 to @xmath200 at @xmath11 ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) . since the number density of luminous optically - selected quasars declines at redshifts beyond @xmath201 ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ) , continued pure - luminosity evolution would lead to a fainter @xmath6 at @xmath5 than at @xmath11 .",
    "meiksin ( 2005 ) determined that a model with continued pure - luminosity evolution that fits the luminous sdss @xmath5 sample would have @xmath202 at @xmath203 .",
    "although we do not necessarily expect the high - redshift evolution to be characterised by luminosity evolution , it is unlikely that the break magnitude would be brighter than it is at @xmath11 , so we consider @xmath200 as a likely lower limit .",
    "barger et al . ( 2003 ) reported a negative search for @xmath204 quasars in the chandra deep field - north ( cdf - n ) .",
    "their work goes deeper than our study ( to @xmath205 ) but covers a much smaller area ( 0.031 sq .",
    "we have therefore repeated our analysis of lf constraints using the lack of @xmath51 quasars in the cdf - n .",
    "the 0.05 confidence contour on @xmath20 and @xmath6 from the cdf - n is plotted on fig.[fig : lfparam ] .",
    "it can be seen that our constraint from cfhqs is considerably stronger than that from the cdf - n due to our survey volume being @xmath206 times greater .",
    "also plotted on fig.[fig : lfparam ] are the constraints on @xmath20 from the luminosity distribution of the sdss ( fan et al .",
    "the cfhqs provides much better lower limits on @xmath20 than the sdss .",
    "for all the values of @xmath7 considered , the 0.05 confidence limit is @xmath8 if @xmath207 and @xmath208 if @xmath209 .",
    "fig.[fig : lf ] shows the lf constraints from the cfhqs more directly .",
    "the colored curves correspond to lf models which are allowed at @xmath210 confidence .",
    "we can use the constrained lf parameters to place an upper limit on the space - density of quasars at @xmath5 brighter than a certain absolute magnitude limit .",
    "we adopt a limit of @xmath211 since at this magnitude cut there is almost no dependence of the density upper limit on @xmath212 , or @xmath6 .",
    "we find that @xmath213 at 95% confidence .",
    "this limit is a factor of 25 lower than the density at @xmath11 measured in the 2slaq+2df surveys ( richards et al .",
    "this confirms that the decline in the space - density of luminous quasars at @xmath214 ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ) is mirrored by the lower luminosity population .",
    "a decline in the space - density of low luminosity quasars has been seen in the range @xmath215 ( barger et al .",
    "2003 ; wolf et al .",
    "2003 ; cristiani et al . 2004 ; sharp et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the large volume and faint magnitude limit of our survey extends this result to @xmath214 .",
    "if the high - redshift quasar lf can be fit by a double power - law with a break at @xmath216 and @xmath217 , then a large fraction of the luminosity emitted by the quasar population will be emitted by quasars that we could have found in our survey .",
    "this means that our survey is useful for providing an upper limit to the number density of ionizing photons emitted by quasars at @xmath5 .    to estimate the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons emitted by a quasar with a given @xmath218 , we assume the typical spectral shape determined for a large sample of quasars by telfer et al .",
    "we assume that 100% of these photons escape from the host galaxy .",
    "the ionizing photon emission density is calculated by multiplying the photon emission rate per quasar by the number density of quasars and integrating over the range of quasar luminosities .",
    "we perform the integration down to quasars as faint as @xmath219 .",
    "fig.[fig : ion ] shows the ionizing photon production rate density for the @xmath5 quasar population as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "contours are plotted for the three different values of @xmath7 considered in the previous section .",
    "note that the shape of the contours is quite similar to the shape of the confidence limits on these parameters determined from our survey for high - redshift quasars .",
    "this is due to the reason outlined previously that the main constraint from our survey is on the number density of quasars brighter than @xmath196 and such quasars dominate the ionizing photon budget unless @xmath7 is very steep .",
    "we note that the ionizing photon production rate density in fig.[fig : ion ] is consistent with the calculations of fan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but not with those of yan & windhorst ( 2004 ) who found a factor of 10 lower rate for the same quasar lf parameters .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "there is considerable debate about the photon density required to reionize the diffuse neutral hydrogen in the universe at @xmath5 .",
    "the main uncertainty is due to recombination of ionized hydrogen atoms , which depends upon the clumpiness of the igm .",
    "a detailed discussion of the clumpiness issue is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we follow meiksin ( 2005 ) and assume that the clumpiness leads to 5 ionizing photons per hydrogen atom necessary for reionization at @xmath5 .",
    "note that this is substantially fewer than the 30 ionizing photons per hydrogen atom used by madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which has been widely used by other authors . under our assumptions",
    "the ionizing photon production rate density necessary for reionizing the universe at @xmath5 is @xmath220photonss@xmath221mpc@xmath222 .",
    "the region of @xmath223 space where the quasar population alone can provide the necessary ionizing flux is shown by the grey shaded regions in fig.[fig : lfparam ] . for",
    "any value of @xmath7 the shaded region does not overlap with the cfhqs 0.05 confidence contours and quasars do not provide enough ionizing photons to reionize the universe . for @xmath224 ,",
    "the quasar emission is dominated by low luminosity quasars and a population with a break at @xmath225 could still reionize the universe , although the details then depend critically upon how far down the lf one integrates .",
    "all the evidence at intermediate redshifts points towards @xmath226 ( boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; croom et al .",
    "2004 ; hunt et al .",
    "2004 ; barger et al . 2005 ; richards et al . 2005 ; but see hao et al . 2005 for evidence that @xmath227 in the local universe ) making it unlikely that @xmath7 could be steeper than @xmath228 at @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude that a 95% confidence upper limit on the ionizing photon rate density provided by quasars at @xmath5 is @xmath220photonss@xmath221mpc@xmath222 .",
    "we have used 3.83 sq . deg . of optical imaging with a magnitude limit of @xmath173 to search for high - redshift quasars .",
    "near - infrared follow - up of candidates selected by their red @xmath45 colours all have @xmath46 colours consistent with being low mass stars : two are t dwarfs , four or five are l dwarfs , and the rest are late - m dwarfs scattered into our selection box by photometric errors .",
    "the lack of quasars at @xmath229 in these data has been used to provide new constraints on the luminosity function .",
    "several surveys underway at cfht will image between @xmath230 sq .",
    "deg . in multiple filters to somewhat shallower depths than the data in this paper . assuming the bright - end slope is not much flatter than the value at @xmath231 of @xmath232 ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) , these surveys will allow the identification of many @xmath229 quasars giving a much more accurate determination of the luminosity function and provide targets for studying the ionization state of the igm .",
    "we have considered the ionizing photon output at @xmath5 and concluded that quasars provide @xmath233photonss@xmath221mpc@xmath222 at 95% confidence and assuming that the faint end slope @xmath217 .",
    "the ionizing photon output from the @xmath214 star - forming galaxy population is subject to significant uncertainties as outlined earlier , but the best estimates give a rate @xmath234photonss@xmath221mpc@xmath222 ( yan & windhorst 2004 ; bunker et al 2004 ; stiavelli et al .",
    "therefore quasars provide less than 30% as many ionizing photons as galaxies at @xmath214 .",
    "the evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction inferred from quasar absorption spectra shows that the universe had been almost completely reionized by @xmath5 ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ; songaila 2004 ) .",
    "since something has to keep the universe reionized at this redshift , the most straightforward explanation is that the galaxy population is responsible .",
