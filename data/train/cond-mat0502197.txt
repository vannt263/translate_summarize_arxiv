    "it is crucial for the implementation and miniaturization of magnetic and spintronic devices to understand the magnetization dynamics of nanostructures at ghz frequencies .",
    "our goal is to create and detect large amplitude ferromagnetic resonance @xcite ( fmr ) of individual nanomagnets .",
    "this is of interest for realizing fast magnetization reversal , and for driving spin currents into adjacent normal metals @xcite .",
    "cavity - based microwave techniques have been used for studying fmr , but these are not sensitive enough for studies of individual nanomagnets and the dynamics of individual domain walls .",
    "@xcite , however , recently showed with a ferromagnetic grating that dc transport measurements on the ferromagnet can form a very sensitive probe for microwave induced fmr , charge dissipation , and their interplay .",
    "earlier experiments already showed that transport measurements also allow for probing the magnetic configuration of individual submicron structures .",
    "_ @xcite using the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect , and klaui _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite using the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) effect , have detected domain wall motion in magnetic nanowires .",
    "work on current - induced dynamics of a single domain wall in a magnetic nanowire by saitoh _",
    "@xcite allowed for determining the domain wall mass .",
    "further , the gmr effect was used for real - time detection of the dynamics of spin valve devices @xcite and for observing spin - transfer induced magnetic oscillations at ghz frequencies @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here how the amr effect can be used for detecting how microwave magnetic fields resonantly enhance magnetization reversal of individual nanomagnets that are embedded in electronic nanodevices .",
    "this allows for analyzing the magnetization dynamics in the metastable state prior to reversal of the magnetization .",
    "we use devices that are patterned by electron beam lithography . in a first step ,",
    "a gold coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) is defined with standard lift - off techniques ( fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the short at the end of the cpw forms a 2 @xmath0 m wide microwave line , and provides the microwave magnetic field .",
    "then a device containing the nanomagnet is fabricated close to the microwave line with shadow mask techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the case of a cobalt strip of 2 @xmath0 m @xmath1 130 nm @xmath1 40 nm .",
    "it is deposited by e - beam evaporation parallel to the microwave line at 2 @xmath0 m distance . in the same vacuum cycle ,",
    "four aluminum fingers are deposited that form clean contacts with the co strip ( fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the microwave field is perpendicular to the plane of the sample and the equilibrium direction of the magnetization , which is a condition for driving the fmr @xcite .",
    "the cpw is connected to a microwave signal generator via microwave probes with 40 ghz bandwidth .",
    "our detection method of fmr is based on microwave - assisted magnetization reversal @xcite . slowly sweeping a static magnetic field parallel to the strip s",
    "long dimension is used for inducing a sudden switch event between the two saturated magnetic configurations . when microwave - driven fmr occurs , the magnetic configuration is excited out of a metastable state , and the static - field induced switching occurs at values closer to zero field .",
    "the switching fields are deduced from recording the strip s resistance @xmath2 during the field sweep . when approaching the switching field , the magnetization is pushed slightly out of its zero - field configuration , which causes a reduction of the strip s amr ( the strip s amr ratio is about 0.6 @xmath3 ) .",
    "magnetization reversal is identified from a sudden return to the zero - field amr value ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the resistance of the sample is measured in a four probe geometry ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) with a lock - in detection technique and 5 @xmath0a ac bias current .",
    "all measurements are done at room temperature .",
    "the switching of the samples is first characterized without applying a microwave field . in our particular sample ,",
    "two types of @xmath2 curves can be obtained ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood when considering that in high - aspect - ratio samples as used here , magnetization reversal occurs by domain wall nucleation and propagation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 curve @xmath4 shows first a small reversible decrease of the resistance @xcite , and then a sharp transition towards the initial resistance at @xmath555 mt , noted as @xmath6 . at this field",
    "a domain wall propagates through the strip . for the @xmath2 curve @xmath7 ,",
    "the resistance also decreases progressively up to @xmath8 at @xmath555 mt , but then drops sharply .",
    "@xmath9 is then constant up to @xmath10 at @xmath565 mt , where a jump towards the initial value is observed . in this case , instead of propagating directly through the sample , the domain wall gets pinned between the voltage probes ( probably by some defect arising from the lithographic process ) , and a higher field is needed to unpin the domain wall @xcite . the decrease in resistance",
    "@xmath11r is due to the spin distribution in the domain wall , which gives a negative contribution to the amr . by comparing @xmath12 to the total variation of resistance @xmath13",
    ", we can estimate the width of the domain wall by @xmath14 250 nm , with @xmath15=0.5 @xmath0 m the distance between the voltage probes .",
    "this value is comparable to the width of domain walls observed in co rings of thickness and width similar to our sample @xcite .",
    "we now turn to discussing microwave - assisted switching , measured in static field cycles while applying a microwave magnetic field as well .",
    "we first set the amplitude of the microwave field to a value of 2.2 mt @xcite , and study the frequency dependence of the switching fields .",
    "fig.[fig3](a ) shows results for @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath16 values are distributed over 0.5 mt due to thermal broadening . in order to gain accuracy ,",
    "the @xmath2 curve for each frequency was performed 10 times and we plot the averaged values . within the precision of the measurement @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath16 are equal : the value of the field at which the domain wall appears between the voltage probes is the same for reversal with and without domain wall pinning .",
    "further , we observe two resonances where the switching fields are decreased at 4.2 and 6.6 ghz . as in fmr measurements , the width and amplitude of these resonances",
    "are linked to the gilbert damping parameter @xmath17 .",
    "fig.[fig3](b ) shows how the switching fields @xmath6 and @xmath16 depend on microwave amplitude @xmath18 , recorded for the frequencies 3 , 4.2 , and 6.6 ghz .",
    "the data taken at 3 ghz ( outside the resonances in fig.[fig3](a ) ) does not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "for the data at 4.2 and 6.6 ghz , however , the switching fields @xmath6 and @xmath16 decrease linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "the precision of our measurement does not allow to discriminate the 4.2 and 6.6 ghz curves .",
    "the same procedure is used to analyze the microwave dependence of @xmath19 .",
    "fig.[fig3](c ) presents results for @xmath19 vs. frequency . here",
    "only one resonance is detected around 4.4 ghz .",
    "this behavior is confirmed in fig.[fig3](d ) : the switching field @xmath19 stays constant when @xmath18 is increased for both 3 ghz and 6.6 ghz microwave fields . when the frequency of the microwave field is set to 4.2 ghz",
    ", @xmath19 decreases with @xmath18 with a step - like dependence .",
    "we rule out that the observed phenomena are not fmr related but due to resonances in the microwave system .",
    "resistance vs microwave amplitude at high static magnetic field ( 200 mt ) , showed heating , but the frequency dependence at fixed amplitude showed variations less than 5 m@xmath20 . with a microwave power of 14 dbm ( corresponding to 2.2 mt ) such resistance variations of the sample correspond to power variations in the microwave line smaller than 1 dbm , and these can not explain the large variations in switching fields that we observe ( see the reference curves at 3 ghz from fig.[fig3](b ) and ( d ) where the power is swept up to 18 dbm ) .",
    "we thus conclude that we observe fmr enhanced switching .",
    "the interpretation of the results relies on the knowledge of the magnetic configuration before switching . at static fields slightly below @xmath19 the magnetic configuration",
    "is known : it consists of two domains separated by a pinned domain wall between the voltage probes .",
    "the magnetic configuration at fields just inferior to @xmath6 and @xmath16 is less clear : the magnetization in the sample can be close to uniform , or a domain wall can already be nucleated , but outside of the voltage probes .",
    "examination of the involved resonance frequency values shows that in our experiments magnetization reversal is always initiated by domain wall dynamics , and not by the dynamics of the uniform mode .",
    "according to the kittel formula @xcite , the resonance frequency of the uniform mode is : @xmath21[h+(n_z - n_x)h_d]}$ ] .",
    "@xmath22 are the demagnetizing factors and @xmath23 the demagnetizing field . with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath23 = 1.8 t and @xmath26 = - 60 mt",
    ", we find @xmath27 21 ghz .",
    "this is far from the measured values , and the observed resonance frequencies also occur well outside the error margin for this estimate .",
    "the resonant mode for @xmath6 and @xmath16 at 4.2 ghz is then more likely to be a domain wall resonance , just as for the 4.4 ghz resonance in @xmath19 . to confirm this last statement , we solve the following equations for domain wall motion @xcite .",
    "@xmath28    here @xmath29 is the domain wall energy per unit area , @xmath30 the saturation magnetization , @xmath31 the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath32 the microwave angular frequency , @xmath33 represents the domain wall displacement along the strip and @xmath34 , the out - of - plane angle of the domain wall , is a deformation parameter .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) accounts for a quadratic pinning center of width @xmath35 and strength @xmath36 @xcite . for a constant domain wall width @xmath37 and small displacements ,",
    "we calculate :    @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath39 is the resonance frequency for the domain wall , with @xmath40 . using the values @xmath23 = 1.8 t , @xmath36 = 57.5 mt , and f = 4.2 ghz , we find with eq.(3 ) that @xmath41 = 0.22 . with @xmath37 = 250 nm",
    "this gives @xmath42 1 @xmath0 m which is a reasonable value since the extension of the potential well can be much larger than the physical dimensions of the pinning center @xcite .",
    "eq.(4 ) was obtained by using for the switching condition the depinning of the domain wall at @xmath43 and neglecting @xmath36 compared to @xmath23 .",
    "this formula allows us to fit the curve at 4.2 ghz of fig.[fig3](b ) . using the value @xmath41 = 0.22",
    ", the model fits the experimental data very well for @xmath17 = 0.013 , close to the 0.01 value measured in polycristalline cobalt @xcite . as a conclusion ,",
    "both the value of the resonance frequency ( 4.2 ghz ) and the switching field dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath16 on @xmath18 at 4.2 ghz confirm that we see single domain wall resonance .",
    "we also observed resonances around 4 ghz in smaller co samples ( 600 nm @xmath1 130 nm @xmath1 20 nm ) where the structure of the domain wall should be similar to the one observed in 2 @xmath0 m @xmath1 130 nm @xmath1 40 nm strips . when the domain wall is pinned between the voltage probes ,",
    "the dependence of the switching field @xmath19 is non - linear with respect to the amplitude of the microwave field .",
    "this can be explained by strong oscillations in a non - quadratic pinning center .",
    "additionally to the domain wall resonance at 4 ghz , we have observed a resonant mode at 6.6 ghz .",
    "this resonance could be attributed to spin - waves or edges mode that can assist the onset of a reversal process .",
    "we have demonstrated a detection method for fmr in nanomagnets , based on transport measurements and microwave - assisted magnetization reversal . we have used amr measurements to probe how magnetization reversal of a co strip is enhanced by resonant microwave magnetic fields . in this high - aspect ratio samples",
    "the magnetization reversal occurs by domain wall nucleation and propagation .",
    "this reversal mechanism is confirmed by our observations .",
    "contrary to traditional fmr techniques , the presented method allows to study single domain wall dynamics .",
    "we acknowledge the rtn spintronics network , and the stichting funtamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) for support .",
    "note that we use here the convention to use the wording ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) for a broad class of resonant phenomena in magnets ( _ e.g. _ spin - wave resonances , domain - wall resonances ) , and not only for resonant driving of uniform precession of the magnetization .",
    "this reversible decrease can be due to a uniform rotation of the magnetization before the magnetic configuration breaks into a domain wall , or to a domain wall pinned close to one of the voltage probes and inflating with the static magnetic field .",
    "the effective value of the field was calculated considering the power sent into a perfect 50 ohm load with a short a the end .",
    "its value was also checked by comparing dc and microwave heating of the sample ( resistance readout ) from sending power through the microwave line , and from checking the microwave transmission of two inductively coupled cpw structures ."
