    "granular gases @xcite are composed of macroscopic particles , grains , which do not conserve the kinetic energy when they collide . as such",
    ", there is no equilibrium state , since an isolated undriven system will cool continuously . to reach and maintain a steady state , a permanent injection of energy",
    "is needed .",
    "typically , this is done by injecting energy through the boundaries or by means of external fields acting on the bulk of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "the system develops large inhomogeneities , often associated to the presence of instabilities .",
    "a driven homogeneous steady state can be obtained if the grains are submitted to a ( fictitious ) external noise force , usually referred to as a stochastic thermostat @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the possible relationship of this kind of forces with real experimental situations has not been discussed in detail , to the best of our knowledge .    in the last years",
    "a quite interesting alternative , overcoming the above difficulty , has been addressed .",
    "the idea is to consider a granular gas confined to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry by placing it between two large parallel horizontal plates separated a distance smaller than two grain diameters , so that the system is actually a granular monolayer @xcite . to keep the system fluidized and",
    "render a steady state possible , it is mechanically vibrated in the vertical direction .",
    "the two - dimensional dynamics of the projection of the grains motion on an horizontal plane is considered .",
    "it has been found experimentally that the behavior of the projected system resembles that of a two - dimensional fluid .",
    "moreover , it remains homogeneous over a wide range of values of the parameters controlling the experiment , eventually reaching a steady homogeneous state . on the other hand , when varying the average density and the intensity of the vibration , the system exhibits a a series of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "a common paradigm for granular gases , employed in many theories and simulations , is that of a collection of uniform smooth inelastic hard spheres or disks , whose collisions are characterized by a constant , velocity independent , coefficient of normal restitution @xcite .",
    "although this model has several shortcomings , it enables to make the relevance of inelasticity clear in the simplest possible scenario . very recently",
    "@xcite , this model has been modified trying to mimic the horizontal dynamics of a vibrated fluid of inelastic hard spheres confined to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry , i.e. the kind of system described above . to do so , the inelastic collision rule for hard disks has been changed in order to account for the mechanism by which the kinetic energy given to the vertical motion of the particles by the vibrating walls is transferred to the horizontal degrees of freedom through the collisions between particles .",
    "since the model is formulated in terms of a deterministic instantaneous collision rule , the methods of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theory developed for inelastic hard spheres and disks @xcite can be easily extended to it @xcite . in this way",
    ", it has been shown that it admits a solution describing a homogeneous steady state , similarly to what happens in the experiments @xcite .",
    "a first relevant question is to somehow evaluate the accuracy of the model to describe the original quasi - two - dimensional vibrated system and , if possible , to compare it with the stochastic thermostat model mentioned at the beginning .",
    "some information about this issue will be provided here by analyzing the relaxation of the temperature towards its steady value as predicted by both models , and the results obtained by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the the original three - dimensional confined system .    as a direct implication of the existence of a mechanism of energy injection ,",
    "there is homogeneous hydrodynamics in the collisional model proposed by brito _",
    "@xcite , i.e. there is a time scale over which the time evolution of the ( granular ) temperature in an homogeneous system obeys a macroscopic differential equation whose solution only depends on the initial temperature @xcite . in the context of kinetic theory , the existence of homogeneous hydrodynamics follows from the one - particle distribution function of the system being _ normal _ , meaning that all its time dependence occurs through the temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , two homogeneous hydrodynamic states of a given system are the same state if both have the same temperature .",
    "the above is true not only at the macroscopic level , but also when the system is described by means of kinetic theory or non - equilibrium statistical mechanics using its distribution function .",
    "of course , there is the possibility of different homogeneous states having the same temperature , but only one of them , at the most , can be described by hydrodynamics .",
    "the above comments apply , in particular , to the steady state , since it is the hydrodynamic state reached by the system in the long time limit .",
    "consider a confined quasi - two - dimensional system which is in the homogeneous stationary state with a temperature @xmath0 .",
    "of course , this refers to the projected two - dimensional system .",
    "then , the vibration intensity is instantaneously decreased so that the new stationary temperature @xmath1 is lower , and the system will cool towards it . at a later time",
    "@xmath2 , the vibration intensity is again modified , now in such a way that the instantaneous value of the temperature @xmath3 be equal to the steady temperature corresponding to the new vibration intensity .",
    "although the temperature of the system has its long time steady value , it is not expected to remain constant , but to deviate from this steady value , going through a maximum or a minimum , and finally tending to stationarity .",
    "the reason to expect this behavior is that , although the system has its steady temperature , it is not in the steady state .",
    "even more , it can not be in a hydrodynamic state for the reasons mentioned above . as a consequence ,",
    "the macroscopic equation for the evolution of the temperature can not be used to describe its evolution following the change of the vibration intensity at @xmath2 .",
    "the experiment just described as well as the predicted behavior of the system , can be considered as reminiscent of the kovacs memory effect occurring in the relaxation of molecular systems towards equilibrium @xcite , that has been extensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to realize that in the above process we are dealing with an intrinsic non - equilibrium system trying to approach its steady state , while the original kovacs effect refers to the relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "moreover , while kovacs carried out an instantaneous quench of the system and studied the evolution of a macroscopic quantity , namely the volume of the system , here what is instantaneously changed is the external parameter controlling the energy injection , and it is the time evolution of the temperature what is followed .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to investigate the presence of a kovacs - like effect in the collisional model for a confined granular gas .",
    "it will be shown that this is the case and that , for a low density granular gas , the effect is well captured by kinetic theory at the level of the ( inelastic ) boltzmann equation in the first sonine approximation .",
    "actually , the effect shows up both when the characteristic speed involved in the formulation of the model of the model is modified both to increase and to decrease the value of the steady temperature and , therefore , leads to a heating and cooling process , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the stochastic thermostat model @xcite and the collisional model @xcite leading to homogeneous steady states of a system of inelastic hard disks are shortly reviewed .",
    "the macroscopic equations for the evolution of the granular temperature and the expressions for its steady value in both models are reminded . by fitting the steady temperatures predicted by the models to the results obtained for the horizontal motion of a confined quasi - two - dimensional system of inelastic hard spheres under vibration by md simulations ,",
    "the phenomenological parameter appearing in each of the models is determined , as a function of the vibration intensity .",
    "then , these values are used into the equations for the evolution of the temperature predicted by each model , and their solutions are compared with md simulation results , without any new fitting parameter .",
    "the agreement of the collisional model is definitely better than that of the stochastic thermostat model . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , the steady velocity distribution is considered .",
    "the md results indicate that the shape of the distribution is very close to a gaussian .",
    "therefore , the first sonine approximation has been considered , and the comparison of the two models with the simulation data has been carried out by using the fourth moment of the velocity distribution , which is closely related to the coefficient of the first sonine correction term . although both , the stochastic and the collisional models , accurately predict that the sonine coefficient is very small , they fail to describe its qualitative dependence with the coefficient of normal restitution of the particles .    in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , an ideal experiment in which the characteristic speed of the collisional model is suddenly changed is described , and analyzed in the low density limit by using kinetic theory .",
    "its predictions for the nonlinear time evolution of the temperature after the jump are compared with numerical results obtained using the direct simulation monte carlo method .",
    "a reasonable good agreement is found .",
    "finally , the last sections contains some summarizing remarks as well as some possible experimental implications of the results reported in the paper .",
    "the system considered is a vibrated granular gas confined to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry .",
    "the grains are smooth , inelastic hard spheres of mass @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 . collisions between particles are characterized by a constant , velocity independent , coefficient of normal restitution @xmath6 , defined in the interval @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , when two particles , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , collide their velocities are instantaneously modified according with @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the relative velocity prior collision and @xmath13 is a unit vector directed from the center of particle @xmath9 to the center of particle @xmath8 at contact .",
    "the system is confined by means of two parallel plates separated a distance @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the bottom plate is vibrating , and for the sake of simplicity , the limit of small amplitude and very high frequency will be supposed .",
    "then the bottom wall moves in a sawtooth way , and every colliding particle finds it at a fixed position and moving with a constant speed @xmath16 directed upwards @xcite .",
    "the upper wall is at rest .",
    "collisions of the particles with both walls are elastic . as the particles collide with the bottom wall , energy is transferred to the vertical degree of freedom of the grains .",
    "afterwards , this energy is transferred to the horizontal degrees of freedom of the grains in the collisions between them .",
    "the interest here is on the behavior of the system when observed from above and the two - dimensional dynamics in the horizontal plane is analyzed .",
    "no effect of gravity is considered .",
    "the system has been designed trying to mimic some experimental setups reported in the literature @xcite . also , a similar confined granular system , but without the top lid has been investigated @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "one of the pursued goals is to avoid the large inhomogeneities usually developed in the bulk of a granular gas when energy is injected inhomogeneously through the boundaries @xcite . in the confined quasi - two - dimensional granular gas considered here ,",
    "homogeneous steady states are possible because the energy injection occurs throughout the whole system @xcite    molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the above system have been carried out by using the event - driven method @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used in the horizontal plane . in the initial state",
    ", grains were homogeneosuly distributed in the horizontal plane equidistant from both walls , and the initial velocities were assigned accordingly with a gaussian distribution of zero average .",
    "details of these initial configurations are always lost in a few collisions per particle and , if the two - dimensional dynamics is considered , the system reaches a time - dependent homogeneous state . in the long time",
    "limit , the system eventually remains in a homogeneous steady state , although when varying the solid fraction and the vibration amplitude , the system exhibits a solid - liquid transition , with different possible solid phases @xcite . for fixed values of the geometrical parameters defining the particles and the system , the density , and the coefficient of normal restitution , the steady temperature depends on the velocity @xmath16 of the vibrating wall .",
    "two models have been proposed in the literature that allows for a homogeneous steady state of a granular gas . in the first one ,",
    "the granular medium is subjected to a bulk injection of energy by means of a stochastic force @xcite .",
    "the model was formulated without having any particular application in mind . on the other hand ,",
    "the second model was designed as a collisional model trying to mimic the effective two - dimensional dynamics of the confined quasi - two - dimensional granular gas @xcite .",
    "next , both models will be shortly summarized , focussing on the subject of interest here , namely their predictions for the homogeneous macroscopic evolution of the two - dimensional granular gas .      in the stochastic thermostat model , energy",
    "is uniformly supplied to the system by means of a white noise force acting independently on each grain @xcite , so that the one - particle velocity distribution , @xmath17 , of a dilute homogeneous gas of inelastic hard disks obeys the boltzmann - fokker - planck equation @xmath18 f({\\bm v}_{1},t ) f({\\bm v}_{2},t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\xi_{0}^{2}}{2}\\ , \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial { \\bm v}^{2}}\\ , f({\\bm v}_{1},t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the operator @xmath19 changes the velocities @xmath20 and @xmath21 to its right into the precollisonal values corresponding to the collision rule given in eq .",

    "in the first part of this paper , the accuracy of the collisional model introduced by brito _",
    "_ @xcite to describe the homogeneous two - dimensional dynamics of a confined gas of inelastic hard spheres has been investigated .",
    "the phenomenological speed parameter involved in the formulation of the model has been determined by fitting the md simulation values of the steady temperature .",
    "next , the time evolution of the temperature when relaxing towards the steady state predicted by the model using that value has been compared with the simulation results , and an acceptable good agreement has been found .",
    "moreover , the fitted characteristic speed of the model is proportional to the vibration velocity of the walls in the original system , what is consistent with its physical interpretation .",
    "a similar program has been carried out with a thermostated random model , often used in the literature to generate a steady state of granular system @xcite , getting a worse agreement with the simulation data .",
    "also the one - particle velocity distribution function of the system in the steady state has been studied . in the simulations , as well as in the two models considered ,",
    "the steady distribution turns out to be quite accurately well described by a gaussian plus a small correction given by the first sonine approximation .",
    "the coefficient measuring the magnitude of the correction term only depends on the value of the coefficient of normal restitution , but not of the parameter measuring the rate of injection of energy in the system .",
    "the first sonine approximation also describes accurately the homogeneous hydrodynamics of the collisional model @xcite . in this context , it must be emphasized that , although the sonine coefficient be quantitatively small , its existence and dependence on time through the temperature is essential for the possibility of a hydrodynamic description .",
    "the second part of the paper deals with a memory effect in the time evolution of the temperature in the collisional model that is also well captured by the first sonine approximation .",
    "the characteristic speed parameter is suddenly changed while the system is relaxing towards its steady state , so that the latter is modified .",
    "this is done in such a way that the system is instantaneously at the steady temperature corresponding to the new speed .",
    "then , the posterior evolution of the temperature exhibits a highly non - monotonic behavior in which the temperature of the system initially deviates from its long time steady value .",
    "this behavior somehow resembles the kovacs effect occurring in the relaxation to equilibrium of molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here largely benefits from considering that , when the characteristic speed is modified , the system was evolving accordingly with the hydrodynamic law .",
    "this allows to determine its distribution function at that moment just from the knowledge of the temperature .",
    "of course , afterwards this property is lost , the distribution function is not determined by the temperature ( i.e. it is not _ normal _ ) and the system is not in the hydrodynamic regime .    under the above hydrodynamic initial condition ,",
    "it is easy to explain the existence of memory effects in the collisional model and to predict the qualitative behavior of the temperature of the system after the jump of the characteristic speed , i.e. whether the temperature keeps on varying monotonically or there is some kind of rebound effect , with the temperature rate changing sign at the moment of the jump .",
    "moreover , quantitative predictions are given by the ( numerical ) solutions of two coupled first order differential equations .",
    "a good agreement has been found between the theoretical predictions and simulation values obtained by the direct simulation monte carlo method .",
    "the reported results show that highly non - linear and non - hydrodynamic evolution of a system can be quite easily understood by means of simple kinetic theory arguments .",
    "quite peculiarly , here this has been done by taking advantage of choosing the initial evolution state as being described by hydrodynamics . moreover , the analysis suggests the possibility of experimentally observing the nonlinear relaxation of the kovacs - like effect in a purely mechanical system , namely the confined quasi - two - dimensional granular gas submitted to vertical vibration .",
    "the restriction to initial hydrodynamic states seems something easily implementable .",
    "then , on the basis of the discussion in the first part of the paper , one could expect that the general trends obtained with the collisional model remain valid in the real system .",
    "for instance , it would not be surprising that the system showed rebound effect ( practically ) always if the jump is done while it is heating and never if done while it is cooling .",
