    "the dissipative terms with collective jump operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 describe collective spin decay into left and right moving excitations that leave the waveguide at the two different output ports [ cf .",
    "fig.[fig : model](a ) ] . therefore ,",
    "in contrast to the coherent part , the dissipative part does not depend on the ordering of the spins along the waveguide .",
    "in the rest of this subsection we discuss the two limiting cases corresponding to a bi - directional ( nonchiral ) situation @xmath42 , and a purely cascaded one where @xmath43 .",
    "we then introduce a more general situation considering multiple chiral waveguides .",
    "we note that the familiar dicke model @xcite in one dimension is obtained from the chiral master equation ( [ chiralme ] ) in the limit of a perfect bidirectional reservoir ; i.e. , when the symmetry between left and right moving excitations is not broken , @xmath44 . in this case , @xmath45 conspires to form the well - known infinite - range dipole - dipole hamiltonian , whereas the lindblad terms form the familiar super- and sub - radiant collective decay @xmath46\\nonumber\\\\&+2\\gamma\\sum_{j , l } \\cos(k|x_j - x_l| ) { \\left(\\sigma_l\\rho \\sigma_j^{\\dag}-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_j{^{\\dag}}\\sigma_l,\\rho\\}\\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both coherent and dissipative parts depend on the distance between spins only up to a multiple of the wavelength .",

    ", this model predicts a non - equilibrium phase transition , e.g. in the @xmath55 manifold , at a critical driving strength @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the other limiting case of a chiral waveguide is a purely unidirectional reservoir , where the spin chain couples only to modes propagating in one direction ( e.g. @xmath43 ) .",
    "one refers to such a system as _ cascaded _ , since the output of each spin can only drive other spins located on its right , without back - action .",
    "the corresponding cascaded master equation was extensively studied in refs .",
    "and it is simply given by setting @xmath43 and thus @xmath57 in eq.([chiralme ] ) .",
    "to gain more insight into the dynamical structure of such a unidirectional channel , we rewrite eq .",

    "the positions of the spins then enter solely via their spatial ordering .",
    "note that such a simplification is only possible in the strict cascaded case , since there is only one collective jump operator , by construction . between the corresponding quantum jumps @xcite ,",
    "the system evolves with the non hermitian hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ nonhermitian ] ) .",
    "it induces _ unidirectional _ interactions between spins , where an excitation of spin @xmath62 can be transferred _ only _ to spins @xmath8 located on its right ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the inverse process is not possible .",
    "in contrast to conventional spin interactions @xcite , these unidirectional interactions are thus fundamentally non - hermitian , and can not be obtained in a closed system .      in a more general context",

    "since the different waveguides are independent , it is straightforward to generalize the chiral me from a single- to a multiple - waveguide network , where each waveguide gives an additive contribution analogous to eq .  .",

    "these chiral networks allow coupling the spins in multiple ways , offering a variety of possibilities to create multipartite entangled states as we illustrate in the next subsection .",
    "the master equations presented above describe the spin networks as a driven , open many - body system , whose dynamics drive the system into a steady state @xmath81 .",
    "generally , this steady state is mixed , but under special circumstances the interplay between driving and dissipation leads to a pure steady state @xmath82 , which in the language of quantum optics is called a _ dark state _ @xcite .",

    ".    we will show below that for a spin ensemble coupled via a chiral network ( @xmath31 ) , there is a set of sufficient conditions under which the steady state is pure .",
