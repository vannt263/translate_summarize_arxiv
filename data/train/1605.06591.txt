    "short term decreases in the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) isotropic intensity ( or density ) following geomagnetic storm sudden commencements ( sscs ) were first observed by @xcite ( forbush decreases , fds ) . in general ,",
    "fds start with a sudden decrease within 3 hours of the ssc onset @xcite , reach maximum depression within about a day and recovers to the usual level over several days ( recovery phase ) .",
    "most of the decreases follow geomagnetic sscs but correlation studies between the ground - based cosmic ray data and spacecraft ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or solar radio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data indicate that the origin of the fd is not the geomagnetic storm but the interplanetary shock ( ip - shock ) associated with the solar eruption such as the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) , which causes the ssc as well @xcite .",
    "the depleting effect of ip - shocks on gcrs is explained by the `` propagating diffusive barrier '' model @xcite .",
    "the compressed and disturbed magnetized plasma in the sheath behind the ip - shock reduces the gcr diffusion from the outer heliosphere due to the enhanced pitch angle scattering and works as a diffusive barrier .",
    "the diffusive barrier suppresses the inward flow arising from the radial density gradient of gcrs and sweeps out gcrs as it propagates radially outward , forming the gcr depleted region behind the ip - shock .    investigating a relation between the heliographic longitude of associated solar eruptions on the sun and the magnitude of gcr depression in fds , a number of studies suggest the east - west asymmetry ( e - w asymmetry ) of fds associated with eruptions on the eastern region of the sun have slightly larger magnitude than western eruptions @xcite .",
    "it is also reported that large fds with prominent magnitudes are often observed in association with eruptions near the central meridian of the sun .",
    "@xcite called this the `` center - limb effect '' .",
    "we note , however , that the e - w asymmetry presented by previous papers seems insignificant due to a large event - by - event dispersion of the maximum density depression in fd masking the systematic e - w dependence .",
    "@xcite and @xcite gave a comprehensive interpretation of the observations including the e - w asymmetry and center - limb effect applying the magnetic configuration model of @xcite to fds .",
    "the ip - shocks associated with solar eruptions are driven by the ejected `` driver gas '' @xcite , i.e. the interplanetary cme .",
    "the central region of the cme ( or the cme ejecta ) , whose longitudinal extent is less than 50@xmath5 at 1 au @xcite , is detected only for ip - shocks originating near the central meridian , while the accompanying shock formed ahead of the cme has a greater longitudinal extent exceeding 100@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a closed magnetic field configuration called the magnetic flux rope ( mfr ) is formed in the central region of the cme @xcite .",
    "expansion of the mfr excludes gcrs from penetrating into the mfr , causing a prominent fd as found by @xcite .",
    "the e - w asymmetry , on the other hand , is attributed to the ip - shock which has a global effect on the gcrs @xcite .",
    "the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) has a spiral configuration known as the parker spiral @xcite and the eruption site on the solar photosphere moves toward west due to the sun s rotation before the ip - shock arrives at earth .",
    "the compressed imf in the sheath of ip - shock , therefore , has a larger magnitude at the western flank of the ip - shock than at the eastern flank , leading to a small diffusion coefficient of the gcr pitch angle scattering @xcite and a larger fd in the eastern events .",
    "this cme - driven shock model is also consistent with the observed longitudinal distribution of the solar energetic particles @xcite .",
    "in addition to the temporal variation of gcr density , fds are often accompanied by dynamic variations of the anisotropic intensity of gcrs ( or gcr anisotropy ) observed with ground - based detectors such as neutron monitors and muon detectors .",
    "the cosmic ray counting rate observed with a ground - based detector is known to show a diurnal variation @xcite , indicating an equatorial gcr flow from the direction of the local time when a maximum count rate is observed .",
    "the enhancement of amplitude and the rotation of phase of the diurnal variation accompanying fds were first reported by @xcite and @xcite performed a statistical analysis of the evolution of diurnal anisotropy for ssc events . @xcite and @xcite also found enhanced north - south asymmetry in gcr intensities observed with the northern and southern geographic polar detectors , indicating an enhancement of the north - south gcr anisotropy in fds .",
    "combination of the observed diurnal and north - south anisotropies enabled @xcite to infer the three - dimensional density distribution .",
    "however , after that , such a three - dimensional analysis of the transient anisotropy was rarely performed until a worldwide detector network started operation .",
    "the counting rate of a single neutron monitor , which is analyzed in most previous studies , contains contributions from the gcr density and anisotropy superposed to each other and analyzing these two contributions separately has been difficult .",
    "also the analysis of the diurnal variation provides only the daily mean of the equatorial anisotropy , which is insufficient for analyzing the dynamic variation during fds .",
    "this has been a problem also in analysis of the temporal variation of gcr density in previous studies , as pointed out by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we put a special emphasis on the analysis of the anisotropy because most of the former works on fds analyzed only the gcr density . the first order anisotropy corrected for",
    "the solar wind convection represents a gcr flow proportional to the spatial density gradient of gcrs .",
    "we can thus derive the density gradient from the observed anisotropy based on parker s transport equation of gcrs in the heliosphere @xcite . while the scalar density only reflects the local information at the observation point , the density gradient vector allows us to infer the three - dimensional spatial distribution of gcrs behind the ip - shock .",
    "only a worldwide detector network viewing various directions in space simultaneously can observe the gcr density and anisotropy separately each with a sufficient temporal resolution . the global muon detector network ( gmdn ) , which is capable of measuring the isotropic intensity and three - dimensional anisotropy of @xmath0 gv gcrs on an hourly basis ,",
    "was completed with four multi - directional muon detectors at nagoya ( japan ) , hobart ( australia ) , so martinho da serra ( brazil ) , and kuwait university ( kuwait ) in 2006 .",
    "an analysis method of deducing the gcr density and anisotropy from the gmdn data has been developed @xcite .    in former analyses of the ip - shock events observed with the gmdn ,",
    "the gcr density and density gradient have been used to analyze a geometry of the gcr depleted region in each individual fd @xcite . in this paper , we perform superposed epoch analyses of the gcr density and gradient derived from observations with the gmdn for 45 ip - shock events and analyze for the first time the average spatial distribution of gcr density behind the ip - shock .    the derivation of the gcr anisotropy , density , and the density gradient from the gmdn data is explained in sections [ sec : anaxi ] and [ sec : anag ] .",

    ", we perform superposition analyses of the density and gradient in section [ sec : ss ] and deduce the average spatial distribution of gcr density behind ip - shock . in section [ sec : sum ] , we present the summary and conclusions .",
    "we analyze a percent deviation from the 27 days average of the pressure corrected hourly count rate , @xmath6 of muons in the @xmath7-th directional channel of the @xmath8-th detector in the gmdn at the universal time @xmath9 .",

    "* ) . the derived anisotropy vector in the geo coordinate system",
    "is then transformed to the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system .",
    "the analytical method of @xcite removes the temperature effect from the derived anisotropy , but not from the density .",
    "we derive the gcr density @xmath12 separately from the anisotropy derivation by best - fitting the model function ( [ eq : fit ] ) to @xmath6 in this paper , on a simple assumption that the temperature effect should be almost averaged out in this best - fitting to all gmdn stations at various locations around the world . in order to evaluate how the derived @xmath12 is influenced by the temperature effect , we performed the following analyses . by using the global forecast system ( gfs ) model for the vertical distribution of high altitude atmospheric temperature ,",
    "one year gmdn data ( @xmath6 ) in 2009 was corrected for the temperature effect on an hourly basis ( @xcite and dr . v. yanke , private communication ) .",
    "one year data in 2009 during the last solar activity minimum was chosen for our analysis to minimize possible technical influences to the correction from fds in the gmdn data , while the performance of an ideal correction method should be independent of the solar activity .",
    "we then obtained a gaussian - like distribution of the difference ( @xmath20 ) between @xmath12s derived from @xmath6s before and after the correction .",
    "we confirmed that the yearly mean @xmath20 is 0.00 % , while a few % seasonal variation due to the temperature effect is recorded in the uncorrected @xmath6 .",
    "we also found that the standard deviation of @xmath20 is 0.18 % .",
    "we will use this value as a measure of the temperature effect included in @xmath12 in section [ sec : ssden ] .",
    "we derive @xmath12 from @xmath6 uncorrected for the temperature effect in this paper , while a fully reliable correction process of @xmath6 which will allow us to derive @xmath12 free from the temperature effect is under development .",
    "the gcr density variation free from the temperature effect can be deduced from count rates recorded by polar neutron monitors ( nms ) , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are percent deviations from the 27 days averages of the pressure corrected hourly count rates recorded by the thule and mcmurdo nms in greenland and antarctica , respectively .",
    "the @xmath24 in equation ( [ eq : nm ] ) gives a good measure of the gcr density , also because it contains only minor effects of the diurnal and north - south anisotropies @xcite . by comparing @xmath12 by the gmdn with @xmath24 by nms in section [ sec : samp ]",
    ", we will confirm that our conclusions in this paper are not seriously affected by the atmospheric temperature effect .",
    "since the median rigidity of primary gcrs observed by nms is @xmath1 gv , while the median rigidity of gcrs observed by the gmdn is @xmath0 gv , we can also analyze the rigidity dependence of the gcr density depression in fds by comparing @xmath12 with @xmath24 .",

    "the anisotropy vector @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq : flow ] ) is defined to direct opposite to @xmath34 , pointing toward the upstream direction of @xmath34 .",
    "we correct the anisotropy vector for the solar wind convection and the compton - getting effect , using the solar wind velocity @xmath31 in spacecraft data and earth s orbital motion speed @xmath35 set at 30 km / s .",
    "hourly solar wind velocity @xmath36 for our analysis is mainly given by the ace level 2 data and we also use the wind spacecraft data when there is a gap in the ace data , after confirming consistency between two data sets before and after the data gap .",

    "following theoretical calculations by @xcite , we assume in this paper constant @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this assumption is also used by @xcite and @xcite and proved to result in a reasonable gcr density distribution in the vicinity of the interplanetary disturbance .",
    "moreover , @xcite deduced the parallel mean free path @xmath47 from the observed `` decay length '' of the loss - cone precursor of an ip - shock event and obtained @xmath47 comparable to our assumption of @xmath58 .      we infer the spatial distribution of gcrs behind ip - shocks by analyzing temporal variations of the gcr density and its spatial gradient in ip - shock events , each identified with a source location on the sun .",

    "we perform a superposition analysis of the 45 central events and deduce the average spatial distribution of gcrs . as seen in sample events in section [ sec : samp ] , all events show different temporal profiles of the solar wind parameters , i.e. the duration and magnitude of the solar wind and magnetic field enhancements , the duration of the magnetic sheath and the mfr signatures following the sheath , are all different between one event and the next , causing different temporal variations in @xmath75 and @xmath76",

    "the @xmath105 calculated by equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) may not give us a real spatial coordinate , because we assume that the spatial distribution of gcrs is constant on the solar wind frame propagating radially outward with solar wind velocity @xmath104 at @xmath9 at earth .",
    "the real spatial distribution actually varies even on the solar wind frame due to , for instance , the expansion of the cme during the propagation past earth .",
    "even so , the conversion gives us an estimation of the spatial scale of the gcr distribution in the fd in the vicinity of earth that is the main subject of the present paper .",

    "this implies that the gcr density minimum region propagating radially outward from the cme eruption on the sun passed north of earth in most of the @xmath67-events , canceling out with the north - south asymmetry of the density depression mentioned above .",
    "the imf sector polarity during fds may also affect the @xmath4 distribution as mentioned in subsection [ sec : ev2 ] , but we have confirmed that the imf sector dependence has only a minor effect on the average @xmath4 distribution in figure [ ssgew]f , by performing the correction for the imf sector dependence described in the next section .      the latitudinal ( north - south ) distribution of gcr density behind ip - shocks has rarely been investigated .",
    "this is partly because solar eruptions are limited in low- and mid - latitude regions on the sun ( see figures [ loc]a and [ loc]c ) , prohibiting reliable analyses of the latitudinal distribution from the gcr density observed at earth s orbit .",
    "the three - dimensional gradient vector analyzed in this paper allows us to deduce the latitudinal density distribution as well as the distribution in the ecliptic plane .",
    "the north - south component of the density gradient , @xmath4 , is expected to be southward or negative ( northward or positive ) in the @xmath71-events ( @xmath73-events ) , if the density minimum region passes north ( south ) of earth while propagating radially outward from the cme eruption in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere of the sun .",
    "it is noted , however , that the sector polarity of the imf ( _ away _ or _ toward _ ) also has to be taken into account when we analyze @xmath4 , because the drift model of the large - scale gcr transport in the heliosphere predicts a persistent latitudinal gradient which depends on the imf sector polarity .",
    "the drift model @xcite predicts a spatial distribution of the gcr density having a local maximum close to the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) @xcite in the `` negative '' polarity period of the solar polar magnetic field ( also referred as the @xmath166 epoch ) when the imf directs toward ( away from ) the sun above ( below ) the hcs .",
    "all ssc events before 2012 in table [ tb : ev ] are recorded in an @xmath166 epoch .",
    "the density distribution in an @xmath167 epoch ( period from 2013 in table [ tb : ev ] ) when the imf directs away from ( toward ) the sun above ( below ) the hcs , on the other hand , is predicted to have a minimum close to the hcs .",
    "the drift model thus predicts positive ( negative ) @xmath4 in _ away _ ( _ toward _ ) imf sectors regardless of @xmath167 or @xmath166 epoch .",
    "this drift model prediction of @xmath4 has been actually confirmed by previous analyses of the gmdn and nm data @xcite .",

    "imf sector polarity is designated referring to the hourly mean magnetic field @xmath42 in ace or wind data as described in subsection [ sec : ev1 ] .",

    "mentioned above , we first calculate the average @xmath4 in each imf sector , respectively for the @xmath71- and @xmath73-events .",

    "cme eruptions from the northern hemisphere on the sun , on the other hand , have a larger event number ( 15 events ) in the eastern region than in the western region ( 11 events ) , possibly resulting in the negative @xmath3 in the left panel of figure [ ssgns]e .",
    "most of the previous studies of fds analyze the temporal variation of a single detector count rate as monitoring the gcr density , or the isotropic intensity at earth .",
    "cosmic ray intensity observed with a ground - based detector , however , includes contributions not only from the density , but also from the gcr anisotropy simultaneously .",
    "only a worldwide detector network , such as the gmdn , allows us to observe the cosmic ray density and anisotropy separately with a sufficient time resolution .",

    "we particularly analyze the gcr density gradient deduced from the anisotropy together with the density in fds recorded following the ip - shocks , each caused by an identified solar eruption . by analyzing the superposed density and gradient in fds caused by eastern , western , northern and southern eruptions on the sun , i.e. the @xmath67- , @xmath68- , @xmath71- , and @xmath73-events respectively , we deduced the average spatial distribution of gcrs in fds .",

    "the density depression in the sheath region is larger in the western flank of ip - shocks than in the eastern flank , because the stronger compressed imf in the western flank shields more gcrs from outside as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the other modulation is in the central cme region behind the sheath and causes the additional density depression in @xmath180 au .",
    "this is attributed to an adiabatic expansion of the mfr formed in the central region of the cme .",
    "the density minimum at the longitudinal center behind the ip - shock , which is caused by the cme ejecta or mfr , was confirmed from the negative and positive enhancements of @xmath3 in the @xmath67- and @xmath68-events , respectively .",
    "the negative and positive @xmath4 enhancements in the @xmath71- and @xmath73-events , indicating the density minimum at the latitudinal center behind ip - shock , are also seen when @xmath4 is corrected for the asymmetry in the _ away _ and _ toward _ imf sectors ( that is , above and below the hcs ) predicted by the drift model .",
    "we also note that the centered density minimum was seen not only in the central cme region but also in the sheath region .    by comparing the density depressions observed with the gmdn and nms",
    ", we confirmed that the rigidity spectrum of the density depression is consistent overall with a soft power - law spectrum @xmath145 with @xmath181 as seen in figure [ ssi]f .",
    "it was also found that the modulation in the central cme region has a softer rigidity spectrum than the modulation in the magnetic sheath .",
    "this may be related to a difference between gcr diffusion coefficients in the ordered magnetic field of the mfr and in the turbulent imf in the sheath region .",
    "the rigidity spectrum getting softer during the recovery phase in @xmath67-events implies that the density depression recoveries faster in @xmath0 gv gcrs than in @xmath1 gv gcrs , while such a recovery is not seen in the @xmath68-events due to the longer duration of the solar wind speed enhancement .",
    "previous studies @xcite analyzed the gmdn and nm data separately , but the combined analyses of these data sets , as presented in the present paper , can provide us with important information on the rigidity dependence of gcr modulation in space weather . we plan to make such analyses in the near future by using the data observed with the world network of nms and the gmdn .",

    "for the first time , we discuss a structure of the gcr depleted region behind ip - shocks using the density gradient derived from the first order anisotropy .",
    "it is thus important to confirm the consistency between the gradient and the density which has been analyzed by most of the earlier works .",
    "we infer the gse-@xmath105 component of the density gradient , @xmath85 , not from the anisotropy but from the observed density in this section for the comparison .",
    "we calculate the density gradient @xmath183 from the superposed @xmath133 shown by black points in figure [ ssi]d , as @xmath184 where @xmath132 is set at 0.02 au as an ad hoc choice .",
    "black points in figures [ ssgx]a and [ ssgx]b display @xmath183 . a green point in figure [ ssgx]a shows @xmath185 , the density gradient inferred from the density distribution ( @xmath134 ) observed with nms , which is displayed by black points in figure [ ssi]e .",
    "it is seen that @xmath183 and @xmath185 are in good agreement with a similar gse-@xmath105 range ( 0 au @xmath131 + 0.2 au ) of their negative enhancement , while the magnitude of the enhancement is three times larger in @xmath185 than in @xmath183 .",
    "the red points in figure [ ssgx]b are the gse-@xmath105 component ( @xmath85 ) of the density gradient derived from the anisotropy , the same as the black points in figure [ ssgew]d .",
    "we can not confirm a consistency between @xmath183 and @xmath85 in figure [ ssgx]b due to the large fluctuation of @xmath183 , but a negative enhancement of @xmath183 in 0 au @xmath131 + 0.2 au seems roughly comparable with @xmath85 .",
    "it is noted that the density gradient , or the anisotropy , can be regarded as reflecting a global spatial structure over @xmath160 au because @xmath0 gv gcrs have a larmor radius of @xmath159 au in the imf of @xmath186 nt .",
    "we change , therefore , the spatial interval @xmath132 in equation ( [ eq : i2 g ] ) to @xmath187 au .",
    "the blue curve in figure [ ssgx]b represents @xmath183 derived from equation ( [ eq : i2 g ] ) with @xmath187 au .",
    "the magnitude of the negative enhancement in the blue curve is fairly consistent with @xmath85 ( red points ) , implying that the density gradient derived from the anisotropy reflects a global structure over a spatial scale comparable to the larmor radius .",
    "we also see some differences between @xmath183 and @xmath85 , e.g. @xmath183 ( blue curve ) shows a negative enhancement starting before the ssc onset ( @xmath120 au ) , but this is obviously an artificial effect of the central derivative with a large @xmath132 in equation ( [ eq : i2 g ] ) .",
    "the @xmath85 deduced from the gmdn ( red points ) , on the other hand , shows the enhancement immediately after the ssc onset .",
    "the left ( right ) panel of figure [ ssgnssec ] displays average spatial distributions of the north - south components of density gradient ( @xmath4 ) in _ away _ and _ toward _ imf sectors in @xmath71-events ( @xmath73-events ) , i.e. @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) in equation ( [ eq : n ] ) ( equation ( [ eq : s ] ) ) , by open and solid circles , respectively .",
    "we can see that the positive ( negative ) @xmath4 in _ away _ ( _ toward _ ) sector is enhanced behind ip - shock in both of the @xmath71- and @xmath73-events as discussed in section [ sec : ssns ] .",
    "it is also noted that the positive enhancement of @xmath188 is larger than the negative enhancement of @xmath189 in @xmath73-events , resulting in the positive enhancement of @xmath190 in @xmath73-events .",
    "this implies that a positive @xmath4 , which arises from the density minimum region propagating radially outward from the southern region on the sun , is superposed on the both of the positive and negative @xmath4s in _ away _ and _ toward _ imf sectors . in @xmath71-events",
    ", we can also see that the negative enhancement of @xmath189 is slightly larger than the positive enhancement of @xmath188 , while this is unclear compared with @xmath73-events .",
    "this results in the small negative enhancement of @xmath190 in @xmath71-events , as discussed in section [ sec : ssns ] .",
