    "the past two decades have witnessed significant development in nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation relations are remarkable discoveries which have quantitatively refined the concept of the second law @xcite as applied to small systems .",
    "one of the central issues in nonequilibrium statistical physics has been in characterizing the universal nature of fluctuations of thermodynamic variables , such as heat and work that quantify entropy generated in non - equilibrium processes .",
    "usually , one measures the accumulated entropic variable , say @xmath0 , over a fixed time interval @xmath1 , and its fluctuations are then characterized through a distribution @xmath2 . defining , for example , @xmath0 as the stochastic total entropy , one",
    "can then prove the detailed and integral type of fluctuation relation for any fixed time interval @xmath1 , in various markov processes @xcite .",
    "for large observation times , one finds the large deviation form @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the large deviation function .",
    "the corresponding cumulant generating function ( cgf ) is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an average over the steady state , and this generates the @xmath7th order of cumulant @xmath8 as @xmath9 for physical quantities related to entropy production , it is well known that the cgf shows the fluctuation relation symmetry @xcite . this symmetry is not only mathematically beautiful but also physically important since it reproduces linear response results and also gives nontrivial relationships on nonlinear responses @xcite .",
    "large deviations and the cgf have been crucial towards constructing universal thermodynamic structure of the nonequilibrium steady state @xcite .",
    "the large deviation function gives us the probability of observing rare events in some fixed observation time window . an interesting and natural question to ask is as to _",
    "how long would one have to wait to see a rare event of a specified size?_. this is just the question of the first passage problem for the stochastic variable @xmath0 . although the physics of fluctuation at fixed time has been intensively studied and a lot of discoveries have been made , surprisingly , only a little is known on the stochastic nature of its time evolution itself .",
    "one expects that the time - evolution of stochastic thermodynamic variables should behave like a biased random walk in some configuration space , but the details of the temporal aspects have not been investigated .",
    "the main aim of this letter is to investigate this aspect , which is clearly necessary for a deeper understanding of stochastic thermodynamics .",
    "in particular we consider the problem of the first passage time distribution ( fptd ) of the desired stochastic variable , which is an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "the fptd here is the distribution of waiting time at which a stochastic variable first reaches some target value .",
    "we consider the typical properties of the fptd of entropy - related variables within the broad and well - established paradigms of stochastic thermodynamics .",
    "three examples of nonequilibrium processes are considered : ( a ) an over - damped driven particle in a ring geometry , ( b ) classical charge transfer via a quantum - dot , and ( c ) heat transfer across a coupled oscillator system [ see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) for a schematic description ] .",
    "note that due to recent development in time - resolved measurement techniques , there are a number of relevant experiments for these setups that look at nonequilibrium fluctuations @xcite .    using these models , we address the following questions .",
    "is there a typical functional form for the fptd and especially its tail",
    "? how does it depend on the sign of entropy produced ?",
    "what are the differences as compared to the time - evolution of a simple biased random walk ? concerning this last question , consider the case where @xmath0 is the position of a biased diffusing particle on the open line . then , defining @xmath10 as the probability that the particle hits @xmath0 for the first time between times @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one easily finds @xcite _ rw ( t , x ) & = & |x| e^-(x - i_1 t ) ^2 / 2 i_2 t e^- i_1 ^ 2 2 i_2 t - 32 t .",
    "[ fbr ] we will use this as a reference form , and aim to figure out the similarities and dissimilarities between this simple random walk picture , and the real stochastic time - evolution of entropic variables . intriguingly with use of the fluctuation relation symmetry , one can derive the asymptotic form of the fptd for these models , and dissimilarities to @xmath13 can be argued .",
    "in addition , we derive the exact expression for mean residence time for the driven particle in the ring geometry which leads to fluctuation - relation - like equality in terms of the fptd .",
    "we consider a colloidal particle driven by a constant force and confined to move on a ring , as depicted in fig .",
    "the dynamics is well - described by the over - damped langevin equations with temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the boltzmann constant is set to unity and let us also set @xmath15 . to proceed , we discretize the space into @xmath16 sites on the ring separated by a small spacing @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the probability to find the particle on the @xmath19th site at time @xmath11 .",
    "its evolution is given by & = & w_,-1 p_-1 ( t ) + w_,+1 p_+1 ( t ) -w _ , p_(t ) , + [ tev ] where @xmath20 is the transition rate matrix element which satisfies the local detailed balance condition @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the potential energy at the @xmath19th site .",
    "it is useful to introduce the winding number , @xmath23 , which , for any given particle trajectory , is obtained by counting the number of times the particle makes the transition from site @xmath16 to the first site ( reverse transitions from the first site to the site @xmath16 are counted with a negative sign ) .",
    "the particle s state can be labeled by the duplet @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that in any given realization of the stochastic process , the particle makes the transition @xmath25 in time @xmath11 .",
    "then the work done is @xmath26 while the heat dissipated into the bath is @xmath27 .",
    "thus , at sufficiently large times , entropy production rate is proportional to the average rate of the winding number . due to the positive force @xmath28",
    ", the particle on average moves in the positive direction and the average winding number rate is positive .",
    "however there is a finite probability to observe the particle moving in the opposite direction .",
    "the ratio of probabilities between positive and negative winding number at any finite time is quantitatively given by the fluctuation relation .",
    "we address the fptd for the winding number .",
    "let @xmath29 be the transition probability from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and let @xmath32 be the probability that first passage between @xmath30 to @xmath31 occurs between time @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",

    "there are two singular values @xmath43 from the denominator , which are connected to each other by the fluctuation relation symmetry @xcite z_+ ( s ) z_-(s ) & = & e^-f la , [ fr1 ] where @xmath44 is the entropy produced in the reservoir for a single winding around the ring . setting @xmath45 , using the above symmetry and eq .",

    "( [ fptd ] ) are now in order .",
    "the asymptotic temporal decay form depends neither on the sign nor on the amplitude of the winding number , although the actual probability of negative and positive winding numbers differ by exponential factor ( in entropy produced ) .",
    "thus , even extremely rare events follow the same asymptotic form . in the linear response regime with small first cumulant ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior is well - explained by the simple random walk picture @xmath13 . in the far - from - equilibrium regime , however , critical deviation from this picture reveals itself in the higher order terms with nontrivial expressions",
    ". this deviation will be significant in small systems where the degree of nonequilibrium is easily increased .",
