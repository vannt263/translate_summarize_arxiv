    "hydrodynamic equations need to be accompanied by appropriate boundary conditions ( bcs ) at the boundaries of the region occupied by the electron fluid . in the general case of viscous flow , we need bcs on the normal and tangential components of the current evaluated at the boundaries of the gpw .    the bc on the normal component can be simply derived by requiring that no charge exit the boundary of the system",
