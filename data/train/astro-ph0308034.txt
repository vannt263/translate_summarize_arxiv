    "the low redshift long - duration cosmological @xmath9-ray burst , grb030329 @xcite afforded an unprecedented glimpse into the aftermath of the explosion .",
    "the sheer brightness of the early optical afterglow @xcite allowed for high - precision ( @xmath10% ) photometric measurements to be obtained from a bevy of meter - class telescopes @xcite .",
    "the optical light curve exhibited 1030% brightness undulations during the first several hours @xcite and then showed a prominent break at day 0.48 @xcite .",
    "later , the optical transient underwent a brightness resurgence ( at about day 2 ) followed by an overall decline that was punctuated by four major re - brightening episodes @xcite .",
    "beginning about 6 days after the burst , the first signs of an underlying supernova ( sn ) component began to emerge in the transient , both spectroscopically @xcite and photometrically @xcite ; the sn was designated by the iau as sn 2003dh @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the sn spectrum in the first two months closely parallels that of the bright type ic sn 1998bw @xcite thus confirming the previous evidence for ( nearly ) contemporaneous sn and grb events from the same progenitor in other bursts ( see @xcite for review ) .    while the nature of the sn associated with grb030329 is , of course , of intense interest , a detailed study of the afterglow holds potential for insight into the structure of grb explosions .",
    "it is standard practice to model the afterglow as arising from a jetted point explosion in a constant density environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a wind - stratified circumburst medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the assumption of an instantaneous explosion with a constant jet opening angle is untenable both on theoretical grounds and empirical grounds . in particular ,",
    "strong variations have been seen in the early afterglows of grbs , e.g. , grb021004 @xcite and grb030329 @xcite .",
    "these re - brightenings in grb030329 require energy addition to the radiating front .",
    "the energy addition can be due to slower moving ejecta shells colliding with the earlier emitted but faster moving ejecta @xcite ; such a hypothesis was first proposed for the variability in grb 021004 @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the energy addition is due to shells with larger opening angles but with slower moving ejecta @xcite .",
    "the placement of the behavior of the late - time afterglow light curve of grb030329 in the context of radio modeling can help distinguish between these two hypotheses @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the multitude of physical processes contributing to the complex behavior of the transient requires a careful treatment of the high - quality data .",
    "although analysis of the vast follow - up data on grb030329 in the literature will no doubt be of great use , we have chosen to focus on optical - ir photometric data obtained from the same telescope and reduced uniformly . whereas the burst has been studied extensively at optical wavelengths , only one other study presents photometric data in the near - infrared @xcite . extending the wavelength coverage by a factor of two",
    "allows stronger constraints to be placed on the extinction , and a better determination of the slope of the afterglow spectrum as a function of time .",
    "in  [ sec : obs ] , we present the optical and infrared data obtained with andicam between day 2 and day 23 after the grb trigger . to disentangle the various physical components of the transient light , in  [ sec : res ] we first show that while the overall source brightness fluctuated in the first 6 days , the spectrum of the transient remained fixed . in ",
    "[ sec : extinct ] , we then fit this early spectrum to find a constraint on the line  of  sight extinction to the grb and the intrinsic afterglow spectrum .",
    "using these values , we then decompose the afterglow and the supernova light in  [ sec : decompose ] .",
    "we compare our results to those obtained in other studies and conclude with some implications for the grb  supernova connection and the explosion structure of grb030329 .",
    "all the observations reported herein were carried out with the andicam instrument mounted on the 1.3-m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the andicam is a dual - channel camera constructed by the ohio state university instrument group .",
    "the camera contains a dichroic that enables two imagers to be simultaneously illuminated : a rockwell 1024@xmath111024 hgcdte `` hawaii '' array , and a fairchild 447 2048@xmath112048 optical ccd .",
    "this instrument was formerly mounted on the yale 1-m telescope at ctio , operated by the yalo consortium @xcite .",
    "andicam has recently been transferred to the 1.3-m telescope at ctio , formerly used for the 2mass survey , where it has been operating since february 2003 by the smarts consortium .",
    "the image scale is smaller at the 1.3-m than it was at the 1-m , and the field of view is now 2.4@xmath112.4  for the ir array , and 6.3@xmath116.3  for the ccd .",
    "the optical images are routinely double binned to provide a pixel scale of 0.37/pixel , while the ir channel significantly oversamples the seeing ( typically 0.8 ) with 0.14  pixels .",
    "the field seen by the ir array can be repositioned slightly by adjusting three tilt axes of an internal mirror .",
    "this allows us to `` dither '' the ir position while an optical integration is underway .",
    "these dithered ir images can be used to generate a sky image without actually moving the telescope .",
    "such sky images are slightly inferior to those made by moving the telescope , since the field is viewed through a different part of the filter , leading to decreased accuracy in flat fielding .",
    "this problem is most significant in the @xmath12-band , which , at the 1.3-m , also suffers from high background levels .",
    "table [ tab : log ] gives a log of the observations with andicam .",
    "the data have been grouped into 13 individual epochs .",
    "as can be seen the total duration of the epochs was always less than 40 minutes , even over epochs where @xmath13 images were acquired .",
    "individual optical images were reduced using iraf / ccdred .",
    "the bias was removed using a mean of several bias frames and the images then flat - fielded using the best composite twilight flats for the appropriate filter .",
    "twilight flats were not obtained on every night of the transient observations but the differential gain variations over several days should not affect the photometric uncertainty at significantly more than the 1% level .",
    "images where the ot light was contaminated with cosmic rays were excluded from the final sample .",
    "individual infrared images were reduced in the following way .",
    "flat fields were created in @xmath14- and @xmath15-bands by subtracting pairs of twilight flats with different sky brightnesses .",
    "after dark subtraction each science frame was divided by the ( normalized ) flat field .",
    "next , a sky frame was created by taking the median of all normalized images for a given epoch , and subtracted after rescaling to match the counts in the original images . in the @xmath15- and",
    "@xmath12-bands strong `` ripples '' are present in the reduced images .",
    "these features likely result from the andicam dithering mode : as mentioned , at each mirror position the light passes through a different part of the filter , creating residual flat fielding errors . in the @xmath15-band",
    "the features could be successfully removed by creating residual flat fields , created from all images ( at all epochs ) taken at the same mirror position . in the @xmath12-band the residual pattern dominated the flux of the transient even after this correction ; therefore , the @xmath12-band observations are not considered further in this paper .",
    "finally , for both the optical and ir images , cosmic - rays were removed using a laplacian edge - detection algorithm @xcite .",
    "usually only one or two images per epoch were obtained per optical filter , while each epoch generated between 721 dithered images per ir filter . in a given ir image ,",
    "often only a few objects were detected at better than 3 @xmath4 , requiring a complicated image alignment procedure in order to stack the images . in a custom pyraf code , we first removed any large scale gradient from a copy of all the images using iraf / mkskyfit , masked hot and cold pixels , and then smoothed these images with a gaussian of width 3 pixels .",
    "the pixel  to  pixel rms  was then determined using an iterative sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "this rms  was then used as an input to dither / precor to mask out all regions of the sky where less than 18 out of the neighboring 5@xmath115 pixels were above three times the rms .",
    "the effect was to create masked images where only objects appear , and the remainder of the pixels are set to zero .",
    "an initial estimate of the true offset was computed using the positional and mirror keywords in the fits headers . for epochs where the seven - point dither pattern was repeated at least once",
    ", we found that a given set of three mirror tilts ( recorded in the fits headers ) consistently mapped source positions to better than one pixel rms . from a training set ,",
    "we fit a linear least - squares transfer ( 3@xmath112 ) matrix to map the three tilts to a nominal @xmath16 source position taking into account the reported telescope pointing , plate orientation , and pixel scale ; we assumed no differential sky rotation from image to image .",
    "the difference between the nominal @xmath16 position in the fiducial image and the nominal @xmath16 position in a given image yielded an estimate of the nominal offset .    to find the precise offsets between a fiducial image and the other images in a given epoch ,",
    "we cross - correlated the masked images using dither / crossdrizzle .",
    "the highest peak in the cross correlation within a 50 pixel width box about the nominal offset position was then found and centroided using shiftfind ; this process yielded a list of sub - pixel offsets with uncertainties less than 0.1 pixels .",
    "individual epochs were then stacked with dither / drizzle using these offsets without re - sampling the data to a finer grid ( i.e. , drizzle.scale = 1 and drizzle.pixfrac = 1 ) .",
    "the offsets between the stacked images of all ir epochs were then computed using the same cross - correlation technique .",
    "the final epoch stacks were made using these epoch  to  epoch offsets as input to the secondary geometry parameters for drizzle ( drizzle.dr2gpar ) , repeating the entire process described above .",
    "the result was a set of stacked , registered images for all ir epochs .",
    "using iraf / fitparam , we calibrated our first epoch ( @xmath17 day ) of optical images to secondary field standards reported in @xcite .",
    "an average extinction vs.  airmass curve from nearby paranal was assumed and the differential color terms found to be consistent with zero .",
    "this implies that our cumulative filter@xmath18telescope response curves reasonably approximate those of the henden system , and thus closely resemble the johnson _",
    "bv _ and kron - cousins _ i _ filters ( i.e. , landolt system ) .",
    "the photometry for all subsequent epochs were computed differentially from the zeropoints established on the first epoch . as a check , primary optical landolt standard stars",
    "were observed on several different photometric nights and found to yield consistent photometry to better than 5% accuracy .",
    "the infrared standard star sj9144 @xcite was observed on the third ( photometric ) epoch ( april 3 ut ) . using curve  of  growth aperture photometry",
    ", we determined a zeropoint for the ir science observations at that epoch and assume a systematic zeropoint uncertainty of 0.05mag .",
    "aperture photometry corrected to the `` infinite aperture '' magnitudes were computed for the transient and all detectable secondary standards in the field for all epochs . as with the optical observations ,",
    "photometry was computed differentially from this fiducial epoch .",
    "the resulting photometry is given in table [ tab : log ] .",
    "note that while our @xmath14-band photometry agrees with the results from matheson et al .",
    "to within the statistical uncertainties , as brought to our attention by k.  krisciunas , our @xmath15-band measurements appear to be about 0.2mag fainter at similar epochs to the results in matheson et al . unfortunately , there are no intercomparison stars at common epochs between the two datasets .",
    "therefore we were unable to determine the origin of the difference in the @xmath15-band .",
    "transient fluxes were first computed from the observed magnitudes assuming the transformations given in @xcite ( optical ) and @xcite ( ir ) .",
    "this revealed a small and consistent curvature in the broadband spectrum in the first several epochs , with an incident spectrum ranging from @xmath19 at the blue end to @xmath20 in the red end .",
    "since the effective wavelength and zeropoint of filters depend upon the incident spectrum we recomputed these quantities by fitting a 2nd - order polynomial to the first epoch .",
    "this fiducial spectrum was then input to iraf / calcphot , part of the stsdas / synphot package to compute the effective wavelengths ( @xmath21 ) and vega - referenced zeropoints of the filters .",
    "the difference between fiducial filter wavelengths and the effective filter wavelengths was small , a few tens of angstroms . though the input spectrum was seen to evolve somewhat over the course of our observations ( see below ) , given the small changes in @xmath21 from the fiducial values , in the subsequent analysis we fix @xmath21 for all filters at all epochs .",
    "the resulting transient fluxes are given in the last column of table [ tab : log ] .",
    "with dense high - precision sampling , the complexity of the early light curve of grb 030329 was revealed .",
    "the temporal features of the early afterglow ( @xmath22 day ) have been described in detail elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "later time `` bumps and wiggles '' ( or rebrightenings ) are also detected in the andicam light curves , shown in figure [ fig : ltcurve ] .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows the transient broadband spectra over the 13 epochs of observations , uncorrected for the effects of dust reddening . as evident , while the overall brightness fluctuated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ltcurve ] ) , there was no apparent change in the spectrum over the first several epochs . to understand the statistical significance of this apparent achromaticity , we take an empirical approach by examining the changes in the 10 color indices , constructed from the 5 observing filters ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : color ] ) .",
    "we compute the color change from the first epoch for all subsequent epochs and estimate the significance of change from the statistical errors on the measurements ( i.e. , only the differential errors are considered ) . between epochs 1 through 4 , 28 out of 30 color changes are consistent within @xmath232 @xmath4 from zero change ; the significance of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 colors changes appears high on epoch 3 ( by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) . from epoch 5",
    "onward , the distribution of color change significances fans out ( as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : decompose ] , there are also secular trends in the evolution of some colors ) .",
    "specifically , the _ kolmogorov - smirnov _ ( ks ) probability that the distribution of color change significances from epochs 14 is drawn from a gaussian of sigma unity centered about zero is @xmath28 but then plummets to below 0.05 by day 10 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the transient spectrum did not begin to evolve significantly until after the fourth epoch of observations .",
    "the lack of a significant color change in the early epochs allows us to decouple the analysis of the afterglow ( dominating the first four epochs ) and the supernova ( contaminating the remainder of the epochs ) . in what follows , using the first four epochs only ,",
    "we determine the intrinsic afterglow spectrum and the line  of  sight extinction concurrently . with these results",
    ", we then decompose the afterglow component and the supernova component . in accordance with early spectroscopic studies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , we find that any contribution to the total optical / ir light from an underlying supernova was @xmath29% in all filters during the first four epochs ( see  [ sec : decompose ] ) .",
    "the achromaticity of the transient spectrum is consistent with the expectation of afterglow emission in the standard synchrotron shock model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the model ,",
    "the intrinsic optical  ir afterglow spectrum is dominated by a featureless power - law spectrum characterized as @xmath6 .",
    "there is , however , an apparent downward curvature to the observed broadband afterglow spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) , which can modeled in the first four epochs as @xmath30jy , from @xmath31 to 18000   ( @xmath32 ) .    given the expectation of an underlying power - law , the curvature is likely due to extinction by dust along the line  of  sight to the burst .",
    "we constrain the intrinsic extinction by normalizing the first four epochs to a unity flux density in @xmath33-band and fit the function , @xmath34 \\times       t[r_v{\\rm ( host ) } , a_v{\\rm ( host ) } , \\lambda/(1 + z)]\\,\\mu{\\rm jy},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath0 are the extinction curves and equivalent @xmath36-band extinction through the galaxy ( `` gal '' ) and the line  of  sight through the host galaxy / progenitor system ( `` host '' ) , respectively .",
    "the redshift of the host is @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "a parametrized transmission function @xmath38 $ ] is adopted from @xcite .",
    "the galactic extinction toward the transient , estimated from galactic foreground ir emission , is @xmath39mag @xcite . following from a recent analysis by @xcite , the statistical error on this estimate is @xmath40mag , or about 10% . in the extinction",
    "fit we fix @xmath41 and thus fix @xmath42mag .    by minimizing @xmath43 ,",
    "we first fit simultaneously for the values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath5 , and found the preferred value of @xmath45 is small ( @xmath47 ) ; we consider this unlikely to be the true value of @xmath35 given the indication ( from spectroscopy and imaging ) that the host is a starburst dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : for such galaxies we would expect an extinction curve @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we examined the results for two values of @xmath49 and 5.1 ( lmc - like ) . for @xmath50 ( 5.1 ) ,",
    "the best fit values are @xmath51mag ( @xmath52mag ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55dof = @xmath56 ( 1.34 ) .",
    "note that the errors given are only derived from the diagonal elements of the cross - correlation matrix .",
    "as figure [ fig : chi ] demonstrates , there is a strong covariance between @xmath46 and @xmath5 in the sense that an intrinsically more blue afterglow requires a higher value of extinction .",
    "though the fits given above are formally acceptable , in both cases , the intrinsic afterglow spectrum would be unusually blue if the origin is a relativistic synchrotron shock .",
    "in previously studied afterglows , the observed temporal decline index @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) could be used to constrain the intrinsic spectral index through the @xmath57@xmath5 closure relations prescribed from synchrotron shock physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in grb030329",
    ", however , the complex temporal behavior does not yield an obvious estimation for the value of @xmath5 .",

    "the cooling frequency @xmath68 corresponds to an energy at which electrons have radiated a significant fraction of their initial energy in the lifetime of the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that the apparent achromaticity of the afterglow over the first 4 epochs , implies that no synchrotron break frequency ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) moved through the optical / ir bandpass from 2.7 to 5.6 days after the burst .",
    "the cooling break frequency , then , likely remained above @xmath69hz during this time . imposing @xmath67 and @xmath35(host ) @xmath70 , we find that @xmath0(host)@xmath71mag .",

    "@xcite and @xcite have noted that the x - ray to optical ratio of the afterglow remained approximately constant from 5 hours to 60 days after the burst , with a spectral index ( if indeed connected by a single power - law ) of @xmath81 .",
    "this single power - law is clearly inconsistent with our assertion that the optical - ir spectral slope is greater than @xmath82 .",
    "this suggests that a ( cooling ) break is required between the optical and x - ray bands above which @xmath83 ( see , for example , fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this statement is at odds with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "if indeed , the x - ray to optical flux ratio remained fixed during our first four epochs @xcite , this implies that @xmath68 remained constant over that period . in turn , this lends support to the hypothesis @xcite that a jet break  from the fast - moving ejecta responsible for optical / ir and x - ray emission  occurred before this time .",
    "this statement is at odds with the conclusion of @xcite .      with an empirical examination of the color evolution in the transient",
    ", we showed that the spectrum began to change after day @xmath846 .",
    "we can now confirm this with a physical model for the transient , assuming a single power - law afterglow spectrum and dust extinction .",

    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : beta ] .",
    "as seen , the first 5 epochs are consistent with a single power - law @xmath2 , synchrotron emission from the grb afterglow .",

    "the combination of the high airmass ( @xmath114 ) and this chosen slit angle could easily account for the anomalous redness of the @xcite spectra .",
    "the measurement of the line  of  sight dust extinction in early grb afterglows is critical to determine the parameters of the shock physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to provide a means to deredden the flux of any coincident supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( in conjunction with an @xmath115 measurement from x - ray spectroscopy ) to constrain the extent of dust destruction near the explosion site @xcite .",
    "our constraint on the line  of  sight extinction toward grb030329 , @xmath0(host ) @xmath116mag is obtained under the assumption that the electron energy index @xmath117 .",
    "@xcite , using independent broadband photometry from @xmath88@xmath15-band on day 5.6 , find a consistent value of @xmath0(host ) = @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "as demonstrated in figure [ fig : chi ] , the coupling between the fit values of @xmath0(host ) and @xmath5 is non - negligible ; therefore , we caution that any subsequent use of these measured quantities should take this covariance into account .",
    "specifically , the lowest values of the @xmath43 surface are well - reproduced under the simple constraint that @xmath120(host)@xmath121 ( for @xmath35(host ) = 3.1 ) . thus if @xmath0(host)@xmath122mag , then @xmath123 .",
    "we compare the line - of - sight extinction toward grb030329 with the average extinction toward hii regions in the host galaxy . assuming case - b recombination and the @xcite interstellar extinction curve , the h@xmath57/h@xmath5 ratio can be converted to @xmath124 using @xmath125 using balmer line luminosities measured by @xcite we find @xmath126 . taking the galactic extinction of @xmath127 into account",
    "we find @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "this is comparable to the extinction inferred by @xcite .",
    "we note that the line luminosities have not been corrected for balmer absorption , as the host luminosity is not yet known ; however , since the equivalent widths of the balmer lines are large when the supernova and afterglow still dominated , this correction will be negligible for h@xmath57 and h@xmath5 .",
    "the low extinction in the line  of  sight toward grb030329 is therefore typical for star forming regions in this galaxy , and should therefore not be taken as evidence for the destruction of dust by the grb itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : chi ] , a value of @xmath130 is formally excluded from the locus of acceptable fits in both cases of @xmath35(host ) .",
    "this then excludes any possibility that the synchrotron cooling break moved through the optical / ir bandpass from 26 days after the grb . in the  [ sec : decompose ] we showed that the passage of cooling break could not explain the subsequent color changes from day 615 , and was therefore also unlikely to have moved through the optical / ir bandpass during that time .",
    "the suggested late - time afterglow features seen in figure [ fig : c1 ] are also an important clue for understanding the structure of grb explosions .",
    "@xcite suggest that the break in the radio light curve around day 10 should have been accompanied by a second break in the optical light curve .",
    "our decomposed afterglow light curve does indeed show some evidence for such a break around day 810 .",
    "the precise timing of the break and the slope of the post - break afterglow light curve depends sensitively on the value of @xmath131 .",
    "based on only a few later - time data points , we also suggest tentative evidence for a fifth re - brightening event around day 1520",
    ". if true , the mechanism for the later - time injection of energy into the radiating front must continue at least until this time .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : color ] , a concurrent supernova about 50% brighter than sn1998bw helps to reproduce the reddening in the @xmath24 color and the bluing in the @xmath132 and @xmath133 colors .",
    "the supernova plus afterglow model is certainly not a perfect ( nor unique ) fit to the data , likely due to the inherent uncertainties in modeling the supernova a priori .",
    "for instance , the modeled sn over - predicts the late - time flux at epoch 13 by @xmath134mag ( this effect was also noted by @xcite ) .",
    "while the spectroscopy of the sn shows it to be conclusively of type ic @xcite , there is a large observed diversity in color and light curves from this class of supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn 2003dh could simply have risen and decayed faster than 1998bw ( see also @xcite ) . instead",
    ", the supernova could have occurred a few days before the grb ( the `` supranova '' scenario ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , as @xcite emphasize , had a grb occurred within a few days ( or even a few months ) after an sn , the optical depth to thompson scattering from the sn shell would be much larger than unity , thus extinguishing the grb .",
    "a highly asymmetric sn explosion could produce lower optical depths for certain viewing geometries , but the lack of strong polarization in the sn spectrum suggests a modest level of asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sn and grb explosions were contemporaneous to within the free - fall collapse time of the progenitor star ( see @xcite ) .    since we did not observe during the peak of the sn ( see figure [ fig : ltcurve ] )",
    ", we do not have a direct measurement of the peak sn brightness .",
    "however , assuming a 1998bw - like evolution of the supernova component , scaled to be 1.5 times brighter ( 0.44mag ) , the peak absolute magnitude of 2003dh is @xmath135mag ; we estimate an uncertainty in this value due to @xmath95 of 0.3mag .",
    "there is an additional @xmath8410% systematic uncertainty in this quantity owing to the unknown peculiar velocity of the host of sn1998bw .",
    "we end by highlighting one of the unique features of andicam , namely the ability to simultaneously image afterglows in both the optical and infrared bands . aside from allowing for efficient characterization of the broadband spectrum to measure line  of  sight extinction , any short timescale ( @xmath84minutes ) color changes in the afterglow could be detected unambiguously .",
    "if such observations were to be conducted in the first few hours after a grb , strong constraints on the passage of the synchrotron peak frequency could be obtained , leading to precision measurements of the peak lorentz factor of the shell .",
    "in addition , the constraints on short term color variations would lead to constraints on the patchiness of clouds near the progenitor @xcite . indeed , with such instruments in the _ swift _ era we look forward to a level of insight even beyond that gleaned from observations of the remarkable transient of grb030329 .                                                                                                                              this paper reports data taken through yale university s share of the smarts consortium .",
