    "sine - gordon ( sg ) models and their coulomb gas representations appear as a low energy effective theory for many types of physical systems .",
    "the so - called `` bulk '' sg model describes the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition in two - dimensional superfluids @xcite and the superfluid to insulator transition of cooper pairs in a chain of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` boundary '' sg model @xcite can be used to describe the chakravarty - schmid transition in a single josephson junction with dissipation @xcite and a quantum impurity problem @xcite in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "powerful theoretical techniques have been developed for studying such sg models including bethe ansatz solutions @xcite , renormalization group analysis ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and functional renormalization group @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work suggested that there is another class of sg models which is important for several kinds of physical systems .",
    "such models can be described by the action @xmath0 where the interaction term @xmath1 is present in the spatial region @xmath2 ( or space - time region for quantum problems ) , which is only a part of the domain @xmath3 over which the noninteracting part @xmath4 is defined .",
    "this should be contrasted to the bulk sg models , in which the interaction term is present in the entire region @xmath3 , and to the boundary sg models , in which the interaction term is present on a line .",
    "we note that models with inhomogeneous @xmath5 can be considered using methods developed in the paper as well , but for concreteness we will consider only constant @xmath6 model ( [ s_gordon_finite ] ) interpolates between the bulk and boundary sg models , and we will refer to it as the interior sine - gordon ( isg ) model . here",
    "are a few examples of physical systems that can be described by such models .",
    "the first example is the problem of  interwire coherence",
    " @xcite in which wires are brought together over a finite length @xmath7 and separated on both ends .",
    "the @xmath8-term describes the correlated umklapp electron scattering in the two wires ( @xmath9 scattering in one wire accompanied by @xmath10 scattering in the other wire ) .",
    "the quantum space - time action of this system has the form of eq .",
    "( [ s_gordon_finite ] ) with @xmath11_x \\times [ 0,\\beta]_\\tau$ ] and @xmath12_x \\times [ 0,\\beta]_\\tau$ ] .",
    "another example comes from a system of quantum particles in one dimension ( e.g. , electrons or cooper pairs in a wire , or ultracold atoms in a weak optical trap ) with a periodic potential present in a finite region of the system .",
    "the @xmath8-term comes from the umklapp scattering on the external potential and is limited to the finite region in the interior of the system .",
    "the third example is the problem of distribution functions of interference fringe amplitudes ( dfifa ) for a pair of independent low - dimensional condensates @xcite .",
    "individual moments of the distribution function can be represented as a microcanonical partition function of coulomb gases @xcite , with positions of coulomb charges restricted to the part of the system from which interference patterns have been extracted .",
    "the latter is typically smaller than the total system size .",
    "for example , in the case of large 2d condensates we have @xmath11_x \\times [ -\\infty,\\infty]_\\tau$ ] , and when the interference pattern is extracted from the area @xmath13 , we have @xmath14_x \\times [ -l/2,l/2]_\\tau$ ] . the relation between the dfifa and the partition function of the isg model",
    "will be outlined below and has also been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a nonperturbative approach to calculating partition functions of a wide class of sg models and coulomb gases , which relies on the mapping of their partition functions to certain problems of statistics of random surfaces .",
    "we point out that our method does not rely on the existence of the exact solutions of sg models , but uses the structure of the multi - point correlation functions in the absence of interactions .",
    "we also note that a suitable extension of our method can be used to compute correlation functions of sg models in equilibrium and non - equilibrium situations",
    ". the particular strength of our approach is that it can be applied to study isg models , which _ can not be analyzed by other theoretical methods_. as a concrete application of our method we calculate dfifa for both 1d and 2d condensates .",
    "we point out that earlier theoretical work on interference experiments focused on 1d systems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) @xcite .",
    "while these boundary conditions are extremely artificial from the point of view of realistic experiments , they allow one to relate the dfifa to the quantum impurity problem @xcite and use certain exact results about the latter @xcite .",
    "methods used in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be generalized either to the realistic case of open boundary conditions ( obc ) ( i.e. , interference patterns extracted from the interior of a large system ) or 2d systems , but these cases can be analyzed using the method discussed in this paper .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the main goal of this paper is to introduce an approach to the analysis of sg models and the problem of dfifa is just one example that illustrates the power of the new method .",
    "the partition function corresponding to the action ( [ s_gordon_finite ] ) is given by @xmath15 . by expanding @xmath16 in powers of @xmath17",
    "we arrive at the grand canonical partition function of the coulomb gas @xcite    @xmath18    here , @xmath19 is a microcanonical partition function of a classical two - component neutral coloumb gas of @xmath20 particles , and @xmath21 is an interaction potential , which is proportional to green s function of the laplace operator on @xmath22 the most familiar case is when @xmath23_x \\times [ -\\infty,\\infty]_\\tau$ ] and @xmath24 .    to evaluate @xmath16 nonperturbatively in @xmath25 we introduce an auxiliary function @xmath26 , which should be understood as a certain distribution function , and is defined in such a way that its @xmath27 moment equals @xmath28 @xmath29 one can use the hankel transformation @xcite to compute @xmath16 from @xmath26 as @xmath30 this equation equation can be verified using the taylor expansion of the modified bessel function @xmath31 and eq .",
