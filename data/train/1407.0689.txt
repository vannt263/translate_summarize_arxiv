    "quantum state transfer from one location to another is a significant problem for quantum information processing systems .",
    "a quantum computer , which consists of different processing units , requires the quantum states to be transferred between its parts .",
    "therefore , quantum state transfer will be an important part of quantum computer design .",
    "there are various ways of achieving this task depending on the technology at hand @xcite . in this article , we consider two related fields of research , quantum state transfer and quantum walks on one - dimensional lattices .",
    "quantum communication through a spin chain was first considered by bose @xcite and since then it has been studied in depth @xcite .",
    "this procedure consists of interacting spins on a chain , whose dynamics is governed by heisenberg , xx or xy hamiltonians .",
    "perfect state transfer ( pst ) through a spin chain , in which adjacent spins are coupled by equal strength , can be achieved only over short distances @xcite .",
    "quantum walks ( qws ) have been introduced as a quantum analogue of classical random walks .",
    "the continuous - time qw has been suggested by farhi and gutmann @xcite as a quantum algorithm to reach the @xmath0th level of a decision tree faster than the classical random walk .",
    "the discrete - time qw has been introduced by aharonov @xcite where the walker has a larger average path length than its classical counterpart .",
    "these properties of qws have allowed development of new quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "many experimental systems for qws have been implemented .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the time - evolution of qubit state transfer through a spin chain can be interpreted as a continuous - time qw and pst is possible over a spin chain of any length with pre - engineered couplings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this interpretation can be extended to discrete - time qw with a position - dependent coin operator @xcite .",
    "pst in quantum walks on various graphs has been studied more specifically for the continuous - time model @xcite .",
    "high fidelity transfer of specific quantum states on variants of cycles has been reported for the discrete - time qw @xcite without considering the internal coin state .    in this article",
    ", we show the perfect transfer of an unknown qubit state from one site ( @xmath1 ) to another ( @xmath2 ) on one - dimensional lattices in discrete - time qw architecture .",
    "we treat the coin as our qubit whose state we aim to transfer .",
    "the coin is an internal degree of freedom of the walker , e.g. polarization , 2-energy levels , angular momenta or spin , which moves on discrete lattice sites . at the end of the walk ,",
    "we apply one more coin operator ( _ recovery operator _ ) to achieve pst .",
    "the recovery operator is independent of the initial coin state and it can be determined before the walk once a coin operator is chosen .",
    "we study the periodicity of each case where pst occurs and show that for all pst cases the quantum walk is also periodic .",
    "moreover , we show that redefinition of the shift operator which amounts a change in the directions in which the walker can move , may lead to pst with appropriate choices of the coin operator .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dtqw ] , we present a brief review of discrete - time qw and introduce spatial and local approaches to the definition of directions for the walker .",
    "we define the boundary conditions ( n - lines and n - cycles ) of the walk . in section [ sec : wtrans ] , we discuss the transfer of the walker between sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 without considering the coin state . in section [ sec : recpst ] , we introduce the recovery operator and give a precise definition of pst for discrete - time qws . in sections",
    "[ sec : nline ] and [ sec : ncycle ] , we obtain the cases where pst occurs for n - lines and n - cycles . in conclusion section ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "one - dimensional discrete - time qw involves two discrete hilbert spaces .",
    "one of them is the position space @xmath3 spanned by the basis states @xmath4 , and the other one is the coin space @xmath5 spanned by basis states @xmath6 .",
    "these spaces correspond to the position and the internal states of the _ walker_. the total quantum state of the walker is determined by both its coin and position degrees of freedom . in other words , the whole space , @xmath7 , is spanned by the tensor product of base states which are denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "time evolution of the walk is governed by a unitary operator which is applied in discrete time intervals ( so - called discrete - time ) to form the steps of the walk .",
    "_ one step _ is defined by two subsequent unitary operators , _ coin operator _ which only affects the coin space and _ shift operator _ which affect both the coin and the position spaces .",
    "thus , one step is given by the unitary operator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are shift , coin and identity operators , respectively .",
    "the most general unitary coin operator can be written as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 gives the bias of the coin , i.e. , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are probabilities for moving left and right , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the parameters defining the most general unitary operator up to a @xmath18 phase .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 are chosen arbitrarily at the beginning of the walk and they remain constant during the walk . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we obtain the well - known hadamard coin operator ( unbiased case ) .",
    "the shift operator is given as    @xmath22    where the sum is taken over all discrete positions of the space .",
    "the shift operator forces the walker to move in a direction determined by its coin state .",
    "the position hilbert space does not necessarily be infinite and it can be restricted to a finite number of sites @xmath23 by choosing appropriate conditions for boundaries . in this case , a different definition for the shift operator is required . in figure",
    "[ fig : latt ] , two boundary conditions for the walk are presented and these are the ones that we will use throughout the article . in figure",
    "[ fig : latt](a ) , the lattice with @xmath23 sites and reflecting boundaries ( _ n - line _ ) is represented .",
    "self loops at the boundaries indicate that wave function is reflected after the shift operator is applied , similar to the approach used by romanelli for the broken links model @xcite .",
    "the shift operator is of the form    @xmath24    where the left ( right)-going part at the first ( last ) site is diverted to the right ( left)-going part at the same site to keep the flux conserved .",
    "thus , the shift operator remains unitary . in figure",
    "[ fig : latt](b ) , the lattice with even @xmath23 sites and periodic boundaries ( _ n - cycle _ ) is represented . here",
    ", we simply connect the first and the last sites with one more edge .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in table [ tb:2line ] , the cases where the walker is found with probability @xmath25 on the 2-line are given .",

    ", we apply appropriate recovery operator , @xmath34 , on ( [ eq : wf2line ] ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain the initial coin state and hence pst .",
    "overall process can be written as    @xmath35    thus , any coin state can be transferred on 2-line perfectly with appropriate @xmath36 values given in table [ tb:2line ] .",
    "we note that recovery operator is constant for a given coin operator and it provides pst for all initial coin states . in each pst case",
    ", the qw is periodic .",
    "for example , after 4 steps of the walk with @xmath20 , if the walker proceeds @xmath31 more steps , the initial quantum state is recovered .",
    "there is also a case with @xmath37 , where 2-line is periodic but it does not lead to pst .",
    "pst requires the total state to localize more than one sites in turn and this process naturally gives rise to periodicity .",
    "after applying the recovery operator , we initialize the walker with the initial coin state at a different site . for example , when @xmath38 , if the walker is acted on by sequence of operations , such as @xmath39 , it will be initialized on sites @xmath25 and @xmath40 alternatingly .",
    "the sequence of initializations which keeps the initial coin state unchanged , suggest us to define a new classification for discrete - time qws which we call _ n - periodicity_. we can define one step of the walk for the example above as @xmath41 .",
    "then , after each step , coin state will be conserved and the only change will occur in the position space .",
    "in other words , @xmath42 is same as that of @xmath43 .",
    "since the walker is localized on two sites in an alternating manner , the qw under consideration becomes 2-periodic .",
    "in general , the number @xmath0 gives the total number of sites where initial coin state is localized during the time evolution .",
    "if qw is periodic , we will call it 1-periodic , i.e. , well - known periodicity concept becomes a member of the general n - periodicity class .",
    "thus , n - line or n - cycle allow maximum n - periodicity .",
    "this definition is useful because it generalizes the periodicity definition so that it includes the pst too .    for @xmath44 ,",
    "reflecting boundaries ensure that there will always be a non - zero probability for finding the walker at @xmath1 , independent of @xmath45 , if there is no destructive interference .",
    "however , the dimension of the position space for 2-line allows the wave function to vanish at @xmath1 and gives rise to the cases given in table [ tb:2line ] .",
    "when we restrict the coin operators to @xmath46 , independent of the initial coin state , the walker is transferred from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath2 to @xmath1 at intervals of @xmath23 steps for all n - lines . in general , the walker is at the position @xmath2 or @xmath1 if @xmath47 or @xmath48 steps are taken , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath49 specifies the number of `` round trips '' of the walker within the lattice . to find the coin state of the walker at @xmath45 ,",
    "we have derived the total quantum states    @xmath50\\otimes{\\mbox{$|n\\rangle$ } } , \\cr { \\mbox{$|\\psi_{2nl}\\rangle$ } } & = e^{il\\theta}[\\alpha{\\mbox{$|\\ua\\rangle$}}+\\beta { \\mbox{$|\\da\\rangle$}}]\\otimes{\\mbox{$|1\\rangle$ } } , } \\label{eq : nline1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the parameters of the coin operator .",
    "here , @xmath53 is a function which adds the phase @xmath54 for odd @xmath23 and it can be defined as @xmath55/2 $ ] .",
    "it is shown in ( [ eq : nline1 ] ) that the total state is periodically localized at opposite sites which agrees with the numerical results .",
    "furthermore , the walk is periodic with a period of @xmath56 steps up to an overall phase .",
    "after @xmath23 steps , we apply recovery operator @xmath57 for pst .",
    "recovery operator is a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 which means that for all coin operators with @xmath46 , there is always a corresponding recovery operator .",
    "hence , step operator @xmath58 makes n - line 2-periodic for @xmath46 .",
    "for 2-cycle , full evolution can simply be written in matrix form as    @xmath59    in ( [ eq:2cycleevol ] ) , we see that , shift operator swaps the position of the walker independent of its coin state . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the total state becomes ( [ eq : coineffect ] ) with @xmath61 .",
    "since the coin operator is unitary , @xmath62 leads to pst after first step .",
    "if we define one - step as @xmath63 , qw becomes 2-periodic and it keeps the initial coin state unchanged . in other words , the initial coin state bounces back and forth between two sites .",
    "in contrast to 2-line , 2-cycle allows pst for all coin operators with the aid of appropriate recovery operators .",
    "we note that , if we choose @xmath21 , without any recovery operator , the walk is naturally periodic with a period of @xmath40 steps for @xmath64 $ ] which generalizes the @xmath20 condition in @xcite .",
    "a special case for pst on circles is the 4-cycle . in this case , we achieve pst by using well - known hadamard coin operator ( in @xmath31 steps ) or the biased coin operator @xmath65 ( in @xmath28 steps ) without any recovery operators . these results are given in table [ tb:4cycle ] and figure [ fig:4cycle ] .",
    "we see that for each pst case the walk is also periodic . in @xcite",
    ", it has been already shown that 4-cycle has a period of @xmath32 steps for @xmath20 .",
    "we extend this result by showing that it also has a period of @xmath30 steps for @xmath65 and period of @xmath28 steps for @xmath37 .",

    "black ( hollow ) dots indicate @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) . ]      now , we consider the n - cycles with even @xmath23 and @xmath69 . since the coin operator is diagonal , @xmath70 and @xmath71 terms do not mix , and generate propagations in opposite directions .",
    "after @xmath72 steps , we find the walker at @xmath2 with probability @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the coin operator adds the phase @xmath73 to the coefficient of @xmath71 in each step .",
    "thus , after @xmath72 steps , the total state becomes    @xmath74    where @xmath75 . without loss of generality",
    ", one can choose @xmath76 and use the recovery operator @xmath77+\\pi)$ ] to achieve pst .",
    "the step operator @xmath78 makes the walk 2-periodic .",
    "if @xmath23 is odd , wave function does not localize at any site except the initial one .",
    "the total state after @xmath23 steps is    @xmath79    appropriate choice for the recovery operator can be given as @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "the step operator @xmath58 makes the walk 1-periodic .",
    "we have shown that the coin operator which is restricted to @xmath46 allows pst on n - cycles .",
    "although , it has not been indicated in the discussion about n - cycles above , spatial approach has been used intrinsically , i.e. , clockwise rotations correspond to @xmath70 .",
    "if the walk is driven by the coin operator @xmath82 ( the flip coin operator ) , we define the directions with the local approach for pst ( see figure [ fig : dirappr ] ) .",
    "when @xmath23 is odd , n - cycle is ill - defined since we have to label at least two edges with the same basis state .",
    "therefore , we consider n - cycles with even @xmath23 only . if we label all edges as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirappr](b ) , after @xmath72 steps , the total state becomes    @xmath83    both case have the overall phase @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the floor function .",
    "the first case shows that pst is achieved after @xmath72 steps .",
    "also , it is clear that we can use @xmath86 to recover the second case and make the walk periodic .",
    "however , n - lines do not have the same property , i.e. , pst is not possible if we use flip coin operator with local approach .",
    "we can demonstrate this fact by evaluating the first two steps as follows :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 involves the flip coin operator .",
    "we see that after each step , the first term in the summation is stuck at site @xmath25 because of the periodicity condition . for an n - line , after @xmath23 steps",
    ", the second term will be stuck at site @xmath23 as well .",
    "thus , neither pst nor periodicity is possible .",
    "we have proposed a pst scheme by introducing recovery operators in discrete - time qw architecture on n - lines and n - cycles .",
    "we have shown that by using identity or flip coin operator , an unknown qubit state can be transferred to an arbitrary distance perfectly with the aid of appropriate recovery operator .",
    "the 2-cycle is the only lattice which allows pst for all coin operators up to n=10 .",
    "also , the hadamard coin and biased coin @xmath65 allow pst on 2-line .",
    "we have shown that the 4-cycle is a special case where pst occurs if the walk is driven by the hadamard coin operator or the biased coin operator @xmath65 , without any recovery operators .",
    "moreover , we have introduced new periodic discrete - time qws on n - lines and also extended periodicity cases which has already been known for 2-cycle and 4-cycle @xcite .",
    "we have shown the strong relation between the periodicity and pst .",
    "since recovery operators are just additional coin operators and pst occurs after small number of steps ( which is comparable with the lattice size ) , it seems that the experimental realization of our scheme is quite feasible with today s technology .",
    "we would like to thank b. pekerten , g. karpat and b. akmak for helpful discussions .",
