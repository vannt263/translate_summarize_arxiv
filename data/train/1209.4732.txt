    "an interesting quantum repeater scheme @xcite based on spin - qd - cavity units was proposed by wang , song , and long in 2012 . in this quantum repeater scheme ,",
    "the electron - spin qubits are static and act as the qubits for storing information .",
    "the photon qubits play a role of a medium for information transfer . when this quantum repeater scheme is extended to three - party quantum communication or a quantum network , ghz state analysis on electron systems",
    "is required . moreover ,",
    "a ghz state analyzer is essential for long - distance quantum communication and quantum network , especially in a multiparty quantum repeater .    in this paper , based on an interface between the polarization of a probe photon and the spin of an electron in a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity , we present a scheme for multi - electron ghz - state analyzer .",
    "all the electron - spin ghz states can be completely discriminated by using single - photon detectors and linear optical elements .",
    "our scheme has some advantages .",
    "first , it can be used to distinguish all the ghz states , not a part of the states .",
    "second , the initial entangled electron - spin ghz states are not changed after being identified and they can be used for a successive task .",
    "third , this scheme has a good application in quantum repeater in which the electron qubits are static and are used to store the information , and the photon qubits play a role of information transfer .",
    "moreover , it is essential for quantum communication and quantum network based on electron - spin qubits .",
    "we consider a singly electron charged self - assembled gaas / inas as interface quantum dot insider an optical resonant double - side microcavity with both mirrors partially reflective ( see fig.[figure1](a ) ) @xcite .",
    "singly electron charged qd , that is , an excess electron is injected into the qd , optical excitation creates an exciton @xmath0 that consists of two electrons bound to one hole .",
    "@xmath0 dominates the optical property of the device and the four relevant electronic levels are shown in fig.[figure1](b ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider that the dipole is resonant with the cavity mode and is probed with a resonant light . due to pauli s exclusion principle , the spin selection rules for this device is described as follows : ( i ) if the excess electron in the spin state @xmath1 , the right - circular polarized photon @xmath2 with @xmath3 ( the superscript uparrow indicates its propagation direction along the normal direction of the cavity , that is , @xmath4 axis ) or the left - circular polarized photon @xmath5 with @xmath3 is couple to the dipole , the photon is reflected by the cavity , both the polarization and the propagation direction of the photon will be flipped .",
    "however , @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is uncouple to the dipole , such photon transmits through the cavity and acquires a @xmath9 mod @xmath10 phase shift relative to a reflected one ; ( ii ) if the excess electron in the spin state @xmath11 , in the same way , @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are are reflected by the cavity , @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( @xmath3 ) are transmitted through the cavity .",
    "therefore , the rule of the input states changed under the interaction between the photons with @xmath12 and the cavity is described as follows : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the hole - spin states @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "before starting to discuss our ghz - state analyzer , let us first extend the study of creating the two - qubit bell states in ref.@xcite to the three - spin ghz states via qd - spin - cavity units discussed above .",
    "the principle of our scheme for ghz - state analysis is shown in fig.[figure2](a ) and fig.[figure2](b ) .",
    "consider three uncorrelated excess spins are in arbitrary states @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and the probe photon 1 and the probe photon 2 are in the polarization state @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the two photons are sent through the input port and the polarizing beam splitter in the circular basis ( c - pbs ) one after another .",
    "the first c - pbs is rotated by @xmath22 after the first photon @xmath20 ( label @xmath23 ) passes through it , so that the second photon @xmath21 ( label @xmath24 ) deserts the first cavity and injects directly into the cavities 2 and 3 in sequence , and emits from the output port @xmath25 .",
    "the first photon @xmath20 ( label @xmath23 ) passes through the cavities 1 and 2 in sequence , and emits from the port @xmath26 .",
    "based on the rules in eq.([eq.1 ] ) , the evolution of the system composed of two photons and three electron spins can be written as @xmath27 when the two - photon system is in the states @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the three - spin system is in the states @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath36 by setting the coefficient @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath39 , or any one of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath40 and the others to @xmath39 , one can obtain the eight maximally entangled three - spin ghz states @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are four photon detectors.,width=8 ]    now , we explain how to implement a complete deterministic three - spin ghz - state analyzer .",
    "the setup of our scheme is depicted in fig.[figure2 ] .",
    "it consists of three parts : ( i ) the photon 1 in the polarization state @xmath44 ( label @xmath23 ) is injected into the cavity 1 and the cavity 2 in succession and it is detected at the port @xmath26 ; ( ii ) the photon 2 in the polarization state @xmath21 ( label @xmath24 ) is injected into the cavity 2 and cavity 3 in sequence and a @xmath22 rotation on the first c - pbs is performed before the second photon @xmath21 passes through it ( so that the photon @xmath21 deserts the the first cavity and injects directly into the cavity 2 and the cavity 3 in sequence ) , and it is detected at the port @xmath25 ; ( iii ) a hadamard transformation ( e.g. , using a @xmath45 microwave pulse ) @xmath46 , @xmath47 on each spin is applied and then the probe photon 3 in the polarization state @xmath48 ( label @xmath49 ) is injected into the cavity 1 , the cavity 2 and the cavity 3 in sequence with a @xmath22 rotation on the first c - pbs again before the photon 3 passes through it .    in the first step",
    ", one can distinguish @xmath50 and @xmath51 from @xmath52 and @xmath53 by simply discriminating the instance which detector is clicked by the photon . after the photon passes through cavity 1 and cavity 2 in succession , it will emit from the port @xmath26 and is in the state @xmath54 hence , we can distinguish @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( corresponds to the instance that the photon is detected by detector @xmath55 ) from @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( corresponds to the instance that the photon is detected by detector @xmath56 ) .    as the same as that in the first step , after the photon 2 passes through the cavity 2 and the cavity 3 in succession , the evolution of the system can be written as @xmath57 that is , one can distinguish @xmath50 ( corresponds to the photon is detected by detector @xmath58 ) from @xmath51 ( corresponds to the detector @xmath59 ) and distinguish @xmath52 ( corresponds to the detector @xmath59 ) from @xmath53 ( corresponds to the detector @xmath58 ) .    with two steps of the quantum nondemolition detectors ( qnd ) shown in fig.[figure2 ] ,",
    "the eight ghz states are divided into four groups , that is , @xmath60 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the next task is only to distinguish the different relative phases in each group and it can be accomplished by applying hadamard transformation on each spin as the eight ghz states will be transformed into @xmath61 obviously , one can distinguish @xmath62 ( corresponds to the instance that the number of the state @xmath63 is odd , that is , corresponds to the detector @xmath59 ) from @xmath64 ( corresponds to an even number of the state @xmath63 , that is , corresponds to the detector @xmath58 ) .    from the analysis above",
    ", one can see that the role of the photon is only the medium for distinguishing the eight ghz electron - spin states and the spins are not destroyed . with the first step , one can distinguish @xmath50 , @xmath51 from @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the second qnd can distinguish @xmath50 from @xmath51 , @xmath52 from @xmath53 , and then all of the ghz states are divided into four groups @xmath65 . with the third step ,",
