    "the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) as a standard candle plays an important role in the cosmological probes .",
    "it is the relations proposed in @xcite that make the measurement of decelerator factor of the universe possible .",
    "based on this relationship , a set of improved techniques are developed , such as the multicolor light - curve shape method ( mlcs ) @xcite , the stretch method @xcite , the spectral adaptive light curve template method ( salt ) and so on . using these methods , the luminosity distance of a supernova",
    "can be measured to a precision @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to these methods which use the light curve shape and color information to standardize the supernova luminosity , some authors use spectral features as the luminosity indicators , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , .",
    "although these methods are very interesting , till now they are not so much competitive as the above mentioned methods .",
    "the sn ia luminosity is affected by many factors .",
    "one of the most important is the host galaxy extinction . as for this",
    ", there exits several methods to estimate it .",
    "the first one is the lira - phillips relation @xcite , which show that the b - v color curve of sn ia with small host galaxy extinction evolves in a similar way within [ 30 - 90 ] days after the maximum light .",
    "therefore , comparing the observed b - v color curve with this color evolution , one can constrain the host galaxy extinction for an individual sn .",
    "the second one is the multicolor light curves shape ( mlcs ) method @xcite , which compare the observed light curves with the template light curves .",
    "the third one is to measure the equivalent width of the interstellar na i d doublet which is correlate to the line of sight dust .",
    "recently , searched the optimal correlation between the b maximum m and the flux ratios at any two wavelengths .",
    "it is claimed that the scatter can be decreased to 0.12 .",
    "however , in that paper , the phases of spectra are required within @xmath2 days around the day of b maximum @xmath3 , and the host galaxy dust extinction are corrected in an indirect method . here",
    "we search the possible relationships between the b maximum m and the flux ratios at different phases , for example , @xmath4 days , with all the supernova spectra are deredden to correct for both galaxy and host galaxy extinction directly .",
    "furthermore , we search the optimal linear relationships by introducing two flux ratios @xmath5 as the luminosity indicators .",
    "it is expected that a part of the intrinsic scatter in the one luminosity indicator case can be compensated by introducing another luminosity indicator , therefore the final scatter can be deceased as much as possible .",
    "after corrected for the host galaxy dust contamination directly , small luminosity scatters of sn ia can be obtained from the flux ratio method , especially in the case of two flux ratios being used as the luminosity indicators . with this",
    ", it is possible to fit the host galaxy extinction and distance modulus at the same time .",
    "such an attempt to constrain the host galaxy extinction and distance modulus is different from the methods employed before .",
    "it can provide another independent estimation on host galaxy extinction and distance modulus .",
    "besides this , several fitting results for the same supernova can be compared with each other since the luminosity - flux ratio ( l - f ) relation has been generalized to other supernova phases besides the maximum day .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop the flux ratio method and make it to be a reliable tool to estimate the distance of type ia supernova and its host galaxy extinction .",
    "we will go through all the procedures to produce a hubble diagram from the supernova spectra by using the flux ratio method .",
    "considering that the number of the train spectra is finite and it is the first time to apply the method , we pay more attentions on the method itself than the detailed results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sn : relation ] concentrates on the luminosity - flux ratio relation , in which the sn ia luminosities are fitted with one luminosity indicator or two luminosity indicators respectively and the optimal luminosity scatters are obtained by searching all the wavelength pairs at each day within [ -6,14 ] . in section [ sn : fitting ] , a method is proposed to constrain the host galaxy extinction and distance of the supernova .",
    "then it is applied to the low redshift samples . in section [ sn :",
    "highz ] , the flux ratio method is applied to the high redshift supernova spectra , and the difference between high redshift supernova samples and the low ones are emphasized . at the end of this section , the hubble diagram and the @xmath6 contour map",
    "are given .",
    "finally we give the discussion and summary in the last section .",
    "the supernova spectra used in this section come from two sources , one is @xcite and the other is the online supernova spectrum archive .",
    "all of them are public available .",
    "the supernovas used in this section are required to satisfy the following conditions : 1 ) there are photometric observations within the time interval [ -6,6 ] day ( relative to the date of b maximum here and after ) and spectrographic observation in the time interval [ -6,14 ] day ; 2 ) @xmath7 ; 3 ) the difference between the b magnitude synthesized from the supernova spectrum and the observed b magnitude must be smaller than 0.05 mag .",
    "totally , we obtained 38 supernovas which are listed in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "in the same table , the following information is also listed : the redshift @xmath8 ( in the cmb rest frame ) , the phase windows each supernova contributed to , the date of b maximum @xmath9 , the apparent b maximum magnitude m , milky way dust extinction @xmath10 , and the host galaxy extinction parameters @xmath11 .",
    "the milky way dust extinction parameter @xmath10 is adopted from the @xcite , while the host galaxy extinction parameter and the time @xmath9 comes mainly from the results of @xcite , and for those supernovas which do not appear in that paper these values are from the results fitted by individual authors .",
    "table [ tbl1x ] is the information of the left supernovas which are not included in the train data set since they do not satisfy the above condition 1 ) or 2 ) but can be used in later section .",
    "the absolute magnitude m is calculated by @xmath12 where m is the apparent b band maximum magnitude , @xmath13 is the @xmath14 correction term in the date @xmath3 which is calculated by the software snana @xcite , @xmath15 is the distance modulus , and @xmath16 @xmath17 is the milky way ( host galaxy ) extinction in @xmath18 band ( strictly , equation [ eq1 ] should be @xmath19 , for low redshift supernova , x is b filter band . in later section ,",
    "we use the simple form .",
    "when it is applied to high redshift samples , it means the strict form ) .",
    "for all supernovas , the distance modulus is adopted from the results of @xcite if it is possible , otherwise it is directly calculated from @xmath8 . in all cases",
    "@xmath20 is fixed at @xmath21 , different choice of @xmath20 does not affect the later analysis but just changes the zero point of the luminosity - flux ratio relation by a constant .",
    "so after here , when @xmath20 is needed , it takes a value of @xmath21 .",
    "all the train spectra are deredshifted to the supernova rest frame , and deredden by using the galaxy and host galaxy extinction presented in table [ tbl1 ] through the ccm extinction law @xcite .",
    "like , the spectrum flux are binned in @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the flux after deredshifted and deredden ) .",

    "since the constraint on @xmath137 is weak , to fit the low redshift supernova spectra listed in table [ tbl1x ] , @xmath0 takes values provided there .",

    "it should be noted that since in every fitting , lots of l - f relations are used , the uncertain due to it is very small , the main uncertain of distance comes from the uncertain of @xmath191 and the difference of the results obtained by the l - f relations at different phase .",

    "this values is the average uncertain of distances for those supernovas which have two or more better results .",

    "another advantage of the method is that not one particular l - f relation but many of them play the decisive role in the distance estimation .",
    "of course , there are a lot of possible factors which affect the flux ratio method .",
    "the most important points are : 1 ) the supernova spectra train data set do not contain some one type of supernova spectrum , then the l - f relations may not fit this type of supernova rightly ; 2 ) the total distortion of the supernova spectrum in the spectrograph , this can be monitored by checking the difference between the observed magnitude and that synthesized from spectra ; 3 ) the host galaxy contamination , lots of supernova spectra have a large fraction of host galaxy component . to exploit these spectra",
    ", it should subtract the host galaxy components from them cleanly .",
    "any case mentioned above will leads to wrong or bad results , may be the snls supernova 03d1gt is such a case .",
    "the other possible factors to affect the method includes : 4 ) the redshift uncertain , both due to the peculiar velocity and the measurement , since in the procedure of deredshift , the error of redshift will leads some uncertain of the spectra in the rest frame ; 5 ) extinction of milky way and host galaxy , the host galaxy extinction for the train spectra will affect the l - f relations and then affect the distance estimation of other supernova , the uncertain in milky dust extinction also will leads to systematic error in the distance estimation ; 6 ) the noise of the spectrum in the measurement ; 7 ) the uncertain of the phase of the train spectra .",
    "all these factors will affect the l - f relation , which make it easy to understand the following things .",
    "first , the host galaxy extinction @xmath162 is only an effective parameter which contains not only the effect of host galaxy extinction but also other factors which may change the spectrum .",
    "when the host galaxy extinction is large , it will dominate among all the possible factors as found in section [ sn : fitting ] .",
    "second , there is no or only weak constraint on @xmath137 .",
    "it is stated in the previous section that this method depends on @xmath137 loosely even in the ideal case .",
    "this dependence will be easily broken by the factors listed above , thus only in a more precise analysis , the flux ratio method can provide an effective constraints on @xmath137 .",
    "finally , let us summary the contents of this paper .",
    "first , we generalized the flux ratio method presented in to supernova spectrum phase which is not around the date of b magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "this is useful when one wants to use this method to study the universe expansion , since generally speaking there are a lot of supernovas which do not have spectrum around the phase @xmath9 but have spectrum at other phase .",
    "second , we search the optimal linear relationships between b maximum magnitude and flux ratios using two flux ratios as the luminosity indicators and obtained a scatter which is small than 0.1 .",
    "the absolute value of the scatter is already small , but more important is that it will improve the scatter compared with that obtained by using only one flux ratio as the luminosity indicator .",
    "this improvement possibly comes from two sides , one is that in some case the intrinsic scatter in one flux ratio case can be offset by introducing another flux ratio , the other is that the scatter due to the spectrum which is not at the same phase maybe be decreased in this method . in",
    ", the linear relation using one flux ratio as the luminosity indicator is studied at the phase @xmath43 on a better spectra samples obtained by the nearby supernova factory collaboration @xcite , whose scatter can be smaller than @xmath203 .",
    "the result is already very good , but we believe that after using two flux ratios as luminosity indicators , the scatter can be decreased further to a very low level .",
    "third , we try to correct the host galaxy extinction directly in this paper .",
    "try to use flux rations which corrected for the host galaxy extinction and intrinsic dispersion without distinguishing the two effects . here",
    ", we have a general host galaxy dust correction , but introduce errors from the uncertainties associated with @xmath204 .",
    "since the flux ratio is the ratio of flux at two wavelengths , it is less sensitive to the change of the host galaxy extinction as the flux itself , but the host galaxy dust is still an obstacle to standardize the supernova peak luminosity in the flux ratio method . without a better host galaxy extinction correction for the supernova samples , one can not get the precise luminosity - flux relation relations . the best method to solve this problem is to redo the analysis in a supernova samples",
    "whose dust extinction is small .",
    "fourth , after searching the luminosity - flux ratio relations , we attempt to use it to fit the distances and host galaxy extinctions of low redshift supernovas .",
    "the results are consistent with that obtained by other independent methods .",
    "however , there exists some degeneracy between distance and the host galaxy extinction , which needs a further study .",
    "last , the same method is applied to the high z supernova samples . before fitting , we research the l - f relations using a smoother average condition in a small wavelength range .",
    "two kind of distances are estimated , from which we obtained the hubble diagram and analyzed the contents of the universe , which support an acceleration universe .",
    "so the flux ratio method can indeed provide another independent way to constrain the distance of sn ia and its host galaxy extinction .",
    "we would like to thank dr wei - min sun and shi qi for improving the manuscript .",
    "this research has made use of the cfa supernova archive which is funded in part by the national science foundation through grant ast 0606772 and the snana software which is developed to analyze the sdss supernova data .",
