    "_ this principle implies spacetime uncertainty relations which in a weaker form can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the planck length @xmath7 .",

    "we denote by @xmath31 the enveloping c*-algebra of the resulting algebra ; it is isomorphic to @xmath32 , the c*-algebra of the continuous functions taking values in the algebra @xmath33 of the compact operators on the separable , infinite dimensional hilbert space , and vanishing at infinity .",

    "the singular properties of fields , products of fields are not _ a priori _ well - defined . on the ordinary minkowski spacetime ,",
    "well - defined products of fields are given by the so - called wick products .",
    "they may be defined by bringing the positive and negative frequency parts of the fields in the product into `` normal order '' , which in momentum space corresponds to putting all destruction operators to the right .",
    "another definition , which , contrary to normal - ordering may also be applied on curved spacetimes , is given in terms of the formal evaluation on the diagonal of a suitably subtracted product ; one has , for instance , at second order @xmath69 .",
    "the two constructions , while equivalent on the ordinary minkowski spacetime , lead to inequivalent generalizations on the quantum spacetime .    in  @xcite , for instance",
    ", an interaction lagrangean was given in terms of the _ usual _ normal ordering of positive and negative frequency parts of @xmath70 , @xmath71 another possibility will be investigated in  @xcite .",
    "there , we consider products of fields at different points as they arise in the context of the yang - feldman equation , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "we then define the so - called quasiplanar wick products by allowing only terms which are local in a certain sense to be subtracted , and show that they are well - defined on the diagonal , i.e. in the limit of coinciding points where @xmath74 .    in this paper",
    "we consider yet another approach .",
    "the evaluation on the diagonal is replaced by a suitable generalization compatible with the uncertainty relations , leading to a regularized nonlocal effective interaction .",
    "the idea is that a product of fields at different points , @xmath75 , may be defined by interpreting @xmath76 as _ mutually independent quantum coordinates _ , that is , by defining @xmath77 and @xmath78 now",
    ", the different spacetime components of each variable @xmath79 , @xmath80 , no longer commute with one another , hence the limit @xmath81 loses its natural meaning .",
    "we can , however , identify the central elements , i.e. take @xmath82=iq^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] for all  @xmath83 .",
    "this amounts to taking the tensor products in  ( [ ind_coord ] ) not over the complex numbers , but over the centre @xmath84 of ( the multiplier algebra of ) @xmath85 .",
    "the limit @xmath81 will then be replaced by a _ quantum diagonal map _ which on each function of @xmath79 evaluates a state minimizing the square euclidean length , while leaving the mean coordinates invariant ( cf .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) .    as a consequence of taking the tensor product in  ( [ ind_coord ] ) over  @xmath86",
    ", the mean coordinates @xmath87 commute with the relative coordinates @xmath79 ( in the strong sense ) , e.g. for @xmath88 , @xmath89= [ q^\\mu , q^\\nu]\\otimes i- i\\otimes[q^\\mu , q^\\nu]= 0.\\ ] ] this fact turns out to be crucial for the construction of the quantum diagonal map and provides an additional motivation for taking the tensor product over @xmath86 ,    actually , the tensor product @xmath90 of @xmath86-moduli can be defined as the completion relative to the maximal c*-seminorm of the quotient of the algebraic tensor product over @xmath91 modulo the two sided ideal generated by the multiples in @xmath92 of @xmath93 , where @xmath94 varies in @xmath86 .",
    "it may be equivalently described as the fibrewise tensor product of bundles of c*-algebras ( continuous fields of c*-algebras , in the terminology of @xcite ) over @xmath15 .",
    "another motivation to use a @xmath86-module tensor product is to view the components @xmath17 of the coordinates commutator as universal data which are the same for the different variables corresponding to independent events .",
    "the @xmath17s are thus treated as a point independent geometric background , which , however , is translation invariant and lorentz covariant .",
    "since the c*-algebra @xmath31 describes the regular representations of ( 1 ) , i.e. integrable to a representation of the weyl relations @xmath95 the uniqueness theorem of von neumann  @xcite , applied to each fibre at @xmath96 , ensures that commutativity implies tensor factorization over @xmath86 .",
    "this fact will allow us to obtain the desired map as a conditional expectation .",
    "furthermore , we will use the tensor product of @xmath97 copies of the basic algebra as an auxiliary algebra , where the mean coordinates are ( affiliated to the algebra ) in the first factor , and where the algebra to which the difference variables @xmath79 are affiliated is identified with a subalgebra of the auxiliary algebra , associated to the factors from slot @xmath98 to @xmath97 .",
    "the desired quantum diagonal map @xmath99 is then obtained by evaluating @xmath100 on such tensor products , where @xmath47 is the localization map  ( [ loc_map ] ) with localization centre @xmath46 , and where @xmath52 is the restriction map .",
    "it turns out that the application of @xmath101 to functions whose symbol do not depend on @xmath11 explicitly , yields expressions which in turn are independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the quantum diagonal map replaces the ordinary evaluation at coinciding points .",
    "contrary to the ordinary case , it yields a well - defined expression when applied to a product of fields , @xmath102 since a nonlocal regularizing kernel @xmath103 appears . we conclude that contrary to the ordinary case , no infinite counterterms have to be subtracted and @xmath104 may be used directly to define the interaction in the quantum theory . regarding the combinatorics ,",
    "it is , however , convenient to additionally apply ordinary normal ordering , and to define a _ quantum wick power _ as @xmath105 the quantum wick power @xmath106 as well as @xmath104 may be understood as functions of @xmath107 , not explicitly depending on @xmath11 , taking values in the field operators . in other words ,",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath104 formally are elements of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the field algebra .",
    "once products of fields are given a precise meaning , one may apply an appropriate perturbative setup . since sharp localization in time is compatible with the spacetime uncertainty relations ( at the cost of complete delocalization in space ) , _ one _ possibility is , for instance , to follow the standard approach to perturbation theory in the interaction representation , involving integrations at sharp fixed times  @xcite .",
    "if the lagrangean is symmetric , the resulting @xmath0-matrix is formally unitary by construction ( at least before renormalization ) .    in  @xcite ,",
    "such an approach was proposed , based on the interaction lagrangean  ( [ old_wick ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting perturbation theory is not free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "this fact was first observed in @xcite where , however , instead of the interaction picture used in @xcite , the theory was defined in terms of modified feynman rules which may be formally derived from a path integral formulation . as",
    "first observed in @xcite the resulting theory violates unitarity , a defect which may be traced back to the problem of time ordering on a ( space / time)-noncommutative theory , as discussed in @xcite : the time ordering naturally defined in the interaction picture formulation ( cf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 6.15 ) ) and subsequent comments , as well as section [ diagramm ] of the present paper ) does not violate unitarity . as a consequence ,",
    "the formulation of the theory in terms of modified feynman rules is not equivalent to the one discussed here .",
    "another inequivalent approach , which , however , yields a unitary perturbation theory was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the yang - feldman equation and will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    instead",
    ", we will again apply the standard approach to perturbation theory in the interaction representation , this time employing the quantum wick products .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian on the quantum spacetime is then given by @xmath110 as a constant operator  valued function of @xmath40 ( i.e. @xmath111 is formally in @xmath112 ) .",
    "while in  @xcite one still had to handle the dependence of the hamiltonian on @xmath14 , in the approach adopted here , @xmath111 is a _ constant _ function of @xmath113 . as a consequence",
    ", our procedure leads to a unique prescription for the interaction hamiltonian on quantum spacetime .",
    "the resulting effective non local hamiltonian is @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the effective nonlocal interaction lagrangean @xmath116    it will be shown in section [ finite ] that the corresponding perturbation theory is free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the ultraviolet regularization arises as a point ",
    "split regularization by convolution with gaussian kernels , and we will show that , by insertion of an adiabatic switch , the perturbation series is order by order finite , and each term is a well defined , closed operator with a common core",
    ". the only remaining source of divergences is then given by possible infinite volume effects arising in the adiabatic limit , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the ultraviolet finiteness of the theory presented in this paper is in accordance with the expectation that noncommutativity of spacetime may regularize the theory .",
    "other examples for ultraviolet finite theories on noncommutative spaces were discussed in @xcite , for instance compact spacetimes , corresponding to finite dimensional algebras .",
    "it is noteworthy that the transition matrix elements will vanish as gaussian functions of the energies and momentum transfers expressed in planck units .",
    "while in the high energy limit the transition amplitudes vanish rapidly as a result of the quantum delocalization of the interaction , in the low energy limit one would expect that the corrections to the ordinary theory on minkowski space vanish .",
    "this is clearly possible only after a finite renormalisation ; the structure of the needed counterterms and the dependence upon the planck length of the renormalisation constants will be studied elsewhere .",
    "note that in the limit where the planck length can be neglected , the renormalized theory on quantum spacetime should coincide with the ordinary renormalized theory on minkowski space . at the physical values of the planck length ,",
    "the effect of the quantum nature of spacetime should manifest itself as quadratic or higher order corrections , since gravitation is not explicitly taken into account , but manifests itself only through the commutator of the coordinates .",
    "a weak point of the approach to quantum field theory on quantum spacetime presented here is that , while , as was first shown in @xcite , the prescription leading to ( [ old_wick ] ) does not alter the _ free _",
    "hamiltonian , the prescription discussed here would indeed change it , replacing it by a deformed operator which would no longer be the zero component of a lorentz vector .",
    "we therefore treat , in this paper , the interaction on a different footing than the unperturbed hamiltonian which we identify with that of the usual free theory . as a consequence",
    ", lorentz invariance is violated in an essential way , since optimally localized states are defined relative to a particular lorentz frame .",
    "however , spacetime translation and space rotation invariance are preserved .",
    "moreover , the evaluation of optimally localized states on the difference variables @xmath79 automatically restricts the joint eigenvalues @xmath117 of @xmath17 to @xmath40 , the basis of @xmath15 , where the electric and magnetic parts of @xmath14 are equal or opposite .",
    "this gives an a posteriori motivation for a similar choice , made in @xcite , which was motivated by simplicity and by the need of preserving space rotation invariance .",

    "indeed , we will show in appendix [ lambdasecondoproof ] that @xmath273 is a schwartz function , by carrying out explicitly the above mentioned computations.@xmath183    note that the kernels @xmath274 appearing in the above proof are transition amplitudes of scattering processes with @xmath258 incoming and @xmath275 outgoing particles .",

    "we will make explicit that in the framework of the regularized interaction proposed in this paper , feynman propagators are no more available at all .    in this discussion",
    "we ignore all problems which may arise in the adiabatic limit , and use the formal ( i.e. defined with constant coupling constant @xmath207 ) time dependent interaction hamiltonian @xmath203 throughout , @xmath276 where the integral kernel @xmath277 is of the form @xmath278 and the gaussian kernel @xmath279 does not depend on  @xmath280 .",
    "introducing the time ordered kernels @xmath281 formal computations yield the formal dyson expansion ( see @xcite ) @xmath282 where we use the notations ( [ smart1][smart8 ] ) .    by integrating over the time variables @xmath283 , we obtain @xmath284 here @xmath285 is the ordering of the wick monomials with respect to the average time , i.e.  the time of the mean position of each @xmath286 : more precisely , with @xmath287 the time component of the four vector @xmath288 , we have @xmath289 where @xmath290 can be thought of as a `` fat vertex '' , i.e. a multi - vertex actually consisting of @xmath124 minkowski vectors .",
    "the time ordering thus defined , as well as the one discussed in  @xcite , arises from ordering the variables @xmath206 in products @xmath205 .",
    "however , in both approaches causality is violated at the planck length scale ( cf .",
    "also  @xcite ) .",
    "a typical manifestation of the violation of causality is the following : suppose that @xmath291 i.e. @xmath292 , then it is not forbidden that @xmath293 for some @xmath294 . in other words , a single field @xmath295 belonging to the first wick monomial can be subsequent in time to some field @xmath296 .",
    "note however , that the above picture is consistent with the request that the large scale limit should reproduce the ordinary ( non regularized ) theory with @xmath297 interaction ; in particular , as @xmath298 , the multi - vertices shrink to their mean positions , and the above average time - ordering reduces to the usual one .",
    "we conclude our discussion by showing that it is not possible to absorb the time ordering in feynman propagators , @xmath299\\omega)$ ] , as one usually does in the framework of ordinary local theories .",
    "in fact , in the approach followed here , we can not construct feynman propagators _ at all _ , while in the original hamiltonian approach based on  ( [ old_wick ] ) as well as in the approach based on the yang - feldman equation it is still possible to rewrite the time ordering in terms of feynman propagators _ together with _",
    "advanced and retarded propagators  @xcite .    to see what happens in the approach adopted here ,",
    "consider as an example the second order contribution to the dyson series with two internal contractions in quantum @xmath300-interaction , as depicted in figure  [ qfish ] .    here ,",
    "the two multi - vertices are sets of four distinguishable points , @xmath301 and @xmath302 , and at most one line originates from each of these points .",
    "a kernel @xmath279 belongs to each multi - vertex .",
    "the internal contractions lead to positive and negative frequency parts of the commutator function , @xmath303 , where @xmath304 . ,",
    "while the time ordering is done with respect to the time components of the mean coordinates of each vertex , leading to the heaviside functions @xmath305 .",
    "we may thus conclude that the distributions arising in the fish graph will not yield feynman propagators at all .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the usual interpretation of feynman graphs as pictorial representations of scattering processes ( `` first a is annihilated , then b is created '' ) should break down on quantum spacetime , as it needs sharply localized events , which are no longer available .",
    "in this appendix , we explicitly compute the kernel @xmath273 , for future reference .",
    "recall that , for any @xmath306 , we write @xmath307 , and @xmath308 .",
    "let @xmath309 be any schwartz function , and @xmath209 . by equation ( [ k ] ) , @xmath310 where @xmath311 is given by @xmath312 the orthogonal matrix @xmath245 is given by ( [ u ] ) .",
    "we now set @xmath313 then , if @xmath314 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath315 onto @xmath316 , we set @xmath317 as a projection onto @xmath318 , @xmath319 ; in the same spirit , @xmath320 .",

    "we may now take a @xmath246 real orthogonal matrix @xmath333 , such that @xmath334 then , @xmath335 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath336 onto @xmath337 , and @xmath338 , as usually .",
