    "molecular wave - functions are generally obtained from a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao - mo ) @xcite employed and studied for many years with the atomic orbitals represented by analytical basis functions .",
    "these studies are performed in two groups of basis function : gaussian - type functions and exponential - type functions .",
    "gaussian - type functions possess a great advantage in the simplicity of evaluation of molecular integrals and are generally preferred in large scale calculations .",
    "many computer programs based on gaussian - type functions have been developed to be used in the fields of applied science .",
    "however , gaussian - type functions are unable to represent the correct behavior of the wave - function at the nuclei and at large distances from it . on the other hand ,",
    "exponential - type functions are better suited then gaussian - type functions to represent the electronic wave - function in both cases since they satisfy kato s conditions @xcite .",
    "+ two aspects of the required nonrelativistic electronic structure calculations by empliying laco - mo method are therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "firstly , the choice of basis function and secondly integral evaluation to obtain the matrix elements in the chosen basis function must be examined .    in relativistic electronic structure theory",
    "the situation is much more complicated .",
    "although the methods have been algebraically described for many - electron systems @xcite still it is contain significant problems .",
    "+ first of all , the criteria for choosing basis functions should be reconsidered .",
    "the numerical convergence of results to nonrelativistic limit by the use of gaussian - type orbitals is slow or sometimes even does not lead to the right results as they do not satisfy kato s conditions . also , they are limited by quantum electrodynamics corrections @xcite .",
    "these ensure maintaining the suitability of exponential - type orbitals in theoretical investigations even they has been limited due to difficulties in efficient calculations of multicenter integrals . on the other hand ,",
    "finite - size nuclear model only requires the use of gaussian - type orbitals @xcite which should be emphasized .",

    ". an approximate solution of dirac equation gives finite - discrete energy spectrum known as positive- and negative - energy spectrum which are represent electronic , positronic energy states .",
    "the accurate calculation of whole spectrum is quite sensitive to mathematical completeness .",
    "it is require the choice of basis functions depending on kinetic balance condition @xcite ; @xmath11 unfortunately , expectation from obtained positive - energy eigenvalues by the solution of dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit to converge to the eigenvalues obtained by the solution of schrdinger equation may not comes true when finite - basis approximation is used .",
    "the kinetic balance condition guarantees the implementation of the variation principle only if the basis - set used in dirac equation matches with the basis - set used in schrdinger equation in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the variational instability , so called variational collapse @xcite or finite basis - set disease @xcite , may arise throughout algebraic solution of the one - electron dirac equation to find the lowest eigenvalues of positive - energy states due to the dirac - hamiltonian is unbounded from below .",
    "the collapse of the obtained positive - energy eigenvalues below the lowest positive - energy ground state have been serious block in relativistic electronic structure calculations and it have been studied quite intensively by many authors since it is comprehended .",
    "numerous approaches were proposed in these studies .",
    "they can be divided into two main groups ; those that based to obtain dirac - like equation where direct variational ( rayleigh@xmath12ritz ) procedure can be applicable and those that based on definition new variational procedure provides rigorous upper and lower bounds to positive- and negative - energy spectrum , respectively .",
    "the studies in first group were possible by a few ways ; applying the variation method to the dirac equation based on the modified dirac operator @xcite , transformation of the dirac - hamiltonian to a block diagonal form through a foldy@xmath12wouthuysen transformation method @xcite , applicaiton of partitioning technique to the dirac equation @xcite , elimination of the small - components in order to get effective hamiltonian only for large - components @xcite and using appropriate finite basis - set @xcite where the positive - energy eigenvalues are obtained bounded from below .",
    "the studies in second group were posssible by using particular variational procedures , lehmann - maehley and minimax methods , @xcite to solution of one - electron dirac equation .",
    "notice that detailed investigations of these procedures were made in @xcite .",
    "+ the use of central coulomb potential in algebraic solution of one - electron dirac equation brings another difficulty which is show up when relativistic angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath13 are positive . here , the obtained positive - energy eigenvalue may lie in forbidden energy gap where , between lowest true positive - energy ground state and the negative - energy spectrum threshold @xmath14 .",
