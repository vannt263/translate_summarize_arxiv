    "since the proposal by li and haldane  @xcite , the concept of entanglement spectrum has attracted much attention , particularly for studying topologically ordered systems .",
    "the entanglement spectrum is the eigenvalue spectrum of the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath14 , the levels of which are in one - to - one correspondence with the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath15 for a subsystem @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath15 is written in terms of @xmath14 as @xmath17 . to date , a number of studies on entanglement spectra have been carried out for a variety of systems .",
    "examples include quantum hall systems  @xcite , topological insulators  @xcite , and quantum spin models in one  @xcite and two  @xcite dimensions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author and his collaborators have studied a class of tensor - network states on ladders . the quantum lattice - gas model in which these states are the exact ground states was first introduced in refs .",
    "the model is referred to as the quantum hard - square model since the basis states of the hilbert space are in one - to - one correspondence with allowed configurations of the classical hard - square model , i.e. , any pair of adjacent sites can not be occupied by more than two particles .",
    "the ground state can be expressed as a superposition of classical configurations , each of which has a weight depending on the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath18 in the classical model is the activity , the boltzmann weight per particle . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors found that the entanglement spectrum of the ground state is critical for both square and triangular ladders when @xmath18 is chosen so that the corresponding classical model is critical .",
    "it was also revealed numerically that entanglement hamiltonians for the square and triangular ladders are well described by @xmath19 and @xmath20 conformal field theories , respectively .",
    "in addition to critical properties , the authors found that the entanglement hamiltonian as well as the reduced density matrix for a triangular ladder are integrable for arbitrary @xmath18 despite the fact that the physical hamiltonian is non - integrable , i.e. , we can not obtain the eigenstates analytically except the ground state . here",
    ", integrability means that reduced density matrices for different values of @xmath18 are mutually commuting , which implies the existence of an infinite number of conserved charges that commute with the entanglement hamiltonian in infinite systems .",
    "this remarkable fact was proved by exploiting the close connection between the reduced density matrix for the triangular ladder and the transfer matrix of the classical hard - hexagon model , which is integrable and was solved by baxter  @xcite .",
    "for a detailed proof , see appendix b in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce and study a two - parameter family of matrix product operators ( mpos ) that exhibit similar integrable structures for special cases .",
    "mpos are operator analogues of matrix product states  @xcite , which have recently attracted much attention from both quantum information and condensed matter points of view .",
    "in fact , our construction of the mpos is motivated by the recent study of entanglement spectra of valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) states in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "note that the vbs states are the exact ground states of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model  @xcite , and can also be described as tensor network states .",
    "we will show that the mpo constructed , say @xmath1 , is proportional to the square root of the reduced density matrix of the vbs state on a hexagonal ladder  @xcite for the particular values of the parameters : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , the mpos with this particular set of parameters do not exhibit any integrability property .",
    "however , we find a surprising property of the mpos for other special cases .",
    "if @xmath21 are on the unit circle centered at the origin , i.e. , @xmath22 , the operators @xmath1 commute with the transfer matrix of the isotropic spin-@xmath3 heisenberg chain , which is usually called as the xxx chain .    the xxx chain is a prototypical example of quantum integrable models and its integrability is well explained by the existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices .",
    "they can be constructed in the framework of the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba )  @xcite . from a modern point of view",
    ", these transfer matrices can also be thought of as mpos .",
    "the relation between the aba and matrix product states was discussed in detail in refs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the bond dimension of the @xmath1 is @xmath0 , while that of the transfer matrix of the xxx chain is @xmath23 .",
    "recently , mpos with finite ( @xmath0 ) or infinite bond dimension ( @xmath24 ) that exhibit some integrable structure have proved to be useful in describing non - equilibrium steady states of anisotropic heisenberg chains driven by local noise at their boundaries  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we prove that @xmath1 with @xmath7 being on the unit circle centered at the origin is proportional to the product of two transfer matrices of the xxx chain with different spectral parameters .",
    "then , combining this fact with the yang - baxter equation , we show that in this case @xmath1 commute with the transfer matrix of the xxx chain , which readily implies that @xmath1 commute with the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath25 and all other conserved charges derived from the logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix .",
    "in addition , we also show that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are mutually commuting if @xmath26 for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for small system sizes ( @xmath27 ) , these properties hold even for arbitrary @xmath7 , which can be verified by explicitly writing out @xmath1 as polynomials in @xmath25 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the total spin operator .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first give a general definition of mpos of bond dimension @xmath30 , acting on the space of states of a spin-@xmath3 chain .",
    "then , in section 2.1 , we briefly review the construction of the transfer matrix of the xxx chain through the aba . in section 2.2 ,",
    "we introduce @xmath1 , the mpos of @xmath0 with the two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we show that @xmath1 is related to the vbs state on a hexagonal ladder if @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we also show that @xmath1 can be thought of as a two - parameter deformation of the gram matrix associated with this vbs state . in section 3",
    ", we discuss integrability properties of @xmath1 for special cases where @xmath7 lie on the unit circle centered at the origin .",
    "we show that these integrability properties can be proved as a consequence of the yang - baxter equation .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section . in appendix",
    "a , the explicit expressions for @xmath1 up to @xmath33 are presented .",
    "we start with a general definition of matrix product operators acting on @xmath34 , i.e. , the space of states of a spin-@xmath3 chain with @xmath4 sites . in the following",
    ", we will use the standard notation to denote the identity and pauli matrices : @xmath35 a translation invariant mpo acting on @xmath36 is written in the form @xmath37\\ , \\sig^{\\al_1 } \\otimes \\sig^{\\al_2 } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\sig^{\\al_n } , \\label{eq : mpo1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are matrices of bond dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) can be thought of as boltzmann weights for the vertex model on a comb ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : weight1 ] ) .",
    "any translation invariant operator acting on @xmath36 can , in principle , be written in the form of equation ( [ eq : mpo1 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we first show that the transfer matrix of the xxx chain can be written in the form of equation ( [ eq : mpo1 ] ) .",
    "then we introduce a two - parameter family of mpos , which are not identical to the transfer matrix .",
    "the mpos introduced are related to a deformation of the reduced density matrix of the vbs state on a hexagonal ladder .",
    "the degrees of freedom live on the edges of the lattice . ]      from the algebraic bethe ansatz  @xcite , one can see that the transfer matrix of the xxx chain with periodic boundary conditions can be cast into the form equation ( [ eq : mpo1 ] ) : @xmath42\\ , \\sig^{\\al_1 } \\otimes \\sig^{\\al_2 } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\sig^{\\al_n } , \\label{eq : trmat}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are matrices of bond dimension @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath46 is an arbitrary parameter , called a spectral parameter .",
    "the operator @xmath47 is called the @xmath48-operator in the literature of quantum integrable systems .",
    "the central object in the aba is the quantum @xmath49-matrix , which is a solution of the yang - baxter equation . for the xxx chain , it is given by @xmath50 by direct calculation",
    ", one can verify the following identity ( @xmath51 relation ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rll ] ) that @xmath54 is a one - parameter family of commuting matrices , i.e. , @xmath55=0 , \\label{eq : tt}\\ ] ] ( for a proof , see refs .",
    "the commutativity of transfer matrices implies that the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath54 are mutually commuting .",
    "an example is the first derivative with respect to @xmath46 : @xmath56 here @xmath25 is the hamiltonian for the xxx chain : @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath45 ) and the periodic boundary conditions are imposed , i.e. , @xmath59 . the other conserved charges ( higher hamiltonians ) can also be obtained via @xmath60 the conserved charges so obtained are local operators , i.e. , the range of interactions does not increase with the size of the chain .",
    "however , their  explicit \" expressions are quite complicated  @xcite .",
    "note that for infinite chains , there is a shortcut .",
    "one can obtain @xmath61 recursively by taking the commutator with the boost operator  @xcite .",

    "now let us consider the correspondence between the vertex configurations and the factors appearing in the expansion of equation ( [ eq : mvbs ] ) .",
    "the factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 may be expressed graphically by bonds with the color @xmath86 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "one sees from the integration rules in equation ( [ eq : rules ] ) that the only diagrams which survive are those in which any vertex in the lattice ( @xmath87 in fig .

    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath100 i.e. , the matrix product operators introduced in equation ( [ eq : cons ] ) are exactly identical to the integral form equation ( [ eq : integralm ] ) .",
