    "let @xmath1 be a _ stationary ( locally finite ) poisson process _ on the space @xmath7 of _ convex bodies _ in @xmath2 , that is , on the space of compact , convex subsets of @xmath2",
    "boolean model _ associated with @xmath1 is the stationary random closed set @xmath0 defined by @xmath8 where the poisson process @xmath1 is identified with its support .",
    "this is a fundamental model of stochastic geometry and continuum percolation with many applications in materials science and physics @xcite .",
    "the intersection of @xmath0 with a compact and convex set @xmath9 is a finite union of compact , convex sets , that is , an element of the _ convex ring _",
    "@xmath10 . it is a common strategy in stochastic geometry to extract and explore local information about @xmath0 via functionals of the intersections @xmath6 .",
    "perhaps the most prominent examples of such functionals on @xmath10 are the intrinsic volumes @xmath11 , which contain important geometric information about the sets to which they are applied .",
    "for instance , for a set @xmath12 from the convex ring , @xmath13 is the volume , @xmath14 is half the surface area , and @xmath15 is the _",
    "euler characteristic _ of @xmath16 ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "the intrinsic volumes have several desirable properties .",
    "in particular , they are _ additive _ , in the sense that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in addition , they are translation invariant , and continuous if restricted to the space of convex bodies .    for a stationary and isotropic boolean model , miles @xcite and davy @xcite obtained explicit formulas expressing the mean values @xmath20 in terms of the intensity measure of @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion and more recent developments related to this fundamental result .    in the following , we are especially interested in second order properties and central limit theorems of the random vector @xmath21 , for a compact and convex _ observation window _",
    "@xmath3 , but in fact we study more general additive functionals of @xmath6 , namely so called _ geometric functionals_. a functional on the convex ring will be called geometric if it is additive , translation invariant , locally bounded and measurable ( see section [ sec:3 ] for details ) .    while previous contributions focus on second order properties and central limit theorems for volume and surface area , to the best of our knowledge we present here the first systematic mathematical investigation of second order properties and central limit theorems of all intrinsic volumes and more general geometric functionals of a stationary boolean model @xmath0 .",
    "the volume functional was first studied in @xcite , while in @xcite berry - esseen bounds and large deviation inequalities were established .",
    "the surface area was investigated in @xcite , and the results were extended in @xcite to more general functionals and point processes .",
    "integrals over boolean models are considered in @xcite , where the volume is included as a special case and also the surface area in the latter one .",
    "volume and surface area of a more general boolean model based on a poisson process of cylinders have been investigated in @xcite . from a geometric point of view ,",
    "volume and surface area are rather special functionals of @xmath0 .",
    "they arise as the restriction of deterministic measures to @xmath0 or the boundary of @xmath0 and do not involve the curvature of the ( possibly intersecting ) grains .",
    "a different though mathematically non - rigorous treatment of second moments of curvature measures of an isotropic boolean model with an interesting application to morphological thermodynamics was presented in @xcite .",
    "our first main aim in this paper is to use the fock space representation of poisson functionals @xcite to explore the covariance structure of geometric functionals of @xmath6 .",
    "combined with some new integral geometric inequalities , which are derived by methods and results from convex and integral geometry , this approach appears to be perfectly tailored to our purposes . under the minimal assumption that the second moments of the intrinsic volumes of the typical grain are finite , we show that for two geometric functionals @xmath22 , @xmath23 tends to some @xmath24 as the observation window is increased in a proper way . for the case that the third moments of the intrinsic volumes of the typical grain are finite we establish a rate of this convergence in terms of the inradius of the observation window and show that it is optimal . via the fock space representation",
    "the asymptotic covariances can be expressed as series of second moments . in the important case of intrinsic volumes of an isotropic boolean model",
    "they can be represented in terms of curvature based moment measures of the typical grain . in particular , the covariance structure of the two - dimensional isotropic boolean model becomes surprisingly explicit . for a vector of geometric functionals of the boolean model",
    ", it is shown that the asymptotic covariance matrix is positive definite under some additional conditions , which are for example satisfied for the intrinsic volumes .",
    "the second order analysis is illustrated by explicit formulas for intrinsic volumes of a boolean model with deterministic spherical grains , for which our formulas reduce to three - dimensional integration of explicitly known integrands .",
    "our second main aim is to prove univariate and multivariate central limit theorems for geometric functionals of @xmath6 . under the same second moment assumptions as for the existence of the asymptotic covariances , we prove that convergence in distribution takes place . in the univariate case we do not need to assume that the functional on the convex ring is translation invariant .",
    "we also obtain rates of convergence under slightly stronger moment assumptions . for the multivariate central limit theorem",
    "we provide an argument that the rate is optimal .",
    "following common belief , we guess that our convergence rate @xmath25 for the univariate case is optimal as well . in the proofs we use the malliavin - stein method for poisson functionals that was recently developed in @xcite . in a sense",
    "this method builds on the fock space representation and the closely related wiener - it chaos expansion of poisson functionals .",
    "the main obstacle to the application of these results is the fact that , as a rule , geometric functionals of @xmath0 admit an infinite chaos expansion .",
    "we can resolve this by bounding the kernels of the chaos expansion in a monotone way .",
    "it is conceivable that the central limit theorem can also be derived with the techniques in @xcite , namely by approximation with @xmath26-dependent random fields using a truncation argument .",
    "but such an approach would neither yield much information on the asymptotic covariance structure nor rates of convergence .",
    "stabilization is another common approach to central limit theorems in stochastic geometry ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the intrinsic volumes ( other than volume or surface area ) stabilize for boolean models with unbounded grains .",
    "moreover , in our setting we would need to control boundary effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we briefly summarize some notation and basic facts about the boolean model . in the third section",
    "we establish the existence of the asymptotic covariances of a vector of geometric functionals of @xmath6 and determine the rate of convergence ; see theorem [ thm : variance ] .",
    "section [ secpos ] is devoted to the positive definiteness of the asymptotic covariance matrix ; see theorem [ posdef ] . in section [ sintegra ]",
    "we focus on intrinsic volumes and introduce a family of curvature based moment measures of the typical grain to study infinite series of second moments arising in the fock space representation .",
    "the main result of this section ( theorem [ tdeltaij ] ) is of some independent interest and is applied in section [ seciso ] to derive formulas for the asymptotic covariances of the intrinsic volumes of an isotropic boolean model in terms of the moment measures mentioned above ; see theorem [ tsigmaij ] .",
    "section [ secspherical ] presents some numerical results for a boolean model with deterministic spherical grains . in section [ secclt ]",

    "appendix a contains the proof of a crucial geometric result which is applied in section [ sintegra ] ( see lemma [ ldecomp ] ) , while appendix b provides a description of the curvature based moment measures from section [ sintegra ] in terms of mixed measures of translative integral geometry .",
