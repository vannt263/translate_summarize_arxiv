    "the diophantine problem of finding integral or rational solutions to a set of polynomial equations has been investigated since ancient times . to this day",
    "there is no general method for finding such solutions and the techniques used to answer many fundamental questions are deep and complex .",
    "one of the leading principles in arithmetic geometry is that the geometric structure of an algebraic variety determines the arithmetic structure of the set of points over the rational numbers .    a clear picture of how the arithmetic mirrors the geometry for varieties is given by curves defined over a number field @xmath0 .",
    "the genus of the curve , a geometric invariant , distinguishes three qualitatively different behaviors for its rational points . for a curve of genus 0 ,",
    "either the set of @xmath0-rational point is empty or the curve is isomorphic to the projective line , whose @xmath0-rational points are infinitely many and well - understood .",
    "on the other hand , for genus at least 2 we have the :    a curve of genus at least 2 defined over a number field @xmath0 has only finitely many @xmath0-rational points .",
    "this is a very deep result , first conjectured by mordell in @xcite and now known as faltings theorem after the groundbreaking proof in @xcite . in between these two extremes , there are the curves of genus 1 . they can be endowed with the structure of an abelian group and the set of @xmath0-rational points , when not empty , is a finitely generated group .",
    "this is a famous theorem of mordell , later generalized by weil to the case of abelian varieties .",
    "vojta in @xcite gave a new proof of the mordell conjecture and then faltings , in @xcite and @xcite , proved an analogous statement for rational points on subvarieties of abelian varieties , which generalizes to points in a finitely generated subgroup @xmath1 .",
    "basing on these results , hindry @xcite proved the case of @xmath1 of finite rank , known as the mordell - lang conjecture .",
    "this was later made quantitative by rmond @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a subgroup of finite rank of an abelian variety @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a proper subvariety .",
    "then the set @xmath4 is contained in a finite union of translates of proper abelian subvarieties by elements of @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , even for curves the different proofs of this theorem are not effective , in the sense that they prove the finiteness of the desired set , but do not hint at how this set could be determined .",
    "one of the challenges of the last century has been the search for effective methods , but there is still no known general method for finding all the rational points on a curve .",
    "the few available methods work under special assumptions and explicit examples are mainly given for curves of genus @xmath5 or @xmath6 as discussed below .",
    "the method of chabauty - coleman @xcite and @xcite provides a bound on the number of rational points on curves defined over @xmath7 with jacobian of @xmath7-rank strictly smaller than the genus . in some examples the estimate gives the exact number of rational points , so that , possibly in combination with _ ad hoc _ descent arguments , one can find the right number of points and list them .",
    "see for example flynn @xcite for one of the first explicit applications of the chabauty - coleman method , siksek @xcite for investigations on how to possibly extend the method to number fields , mccallum and poonen @xcite and stoll @xcite for general surveys and also their references for additional variations and applications of this method . for curves of genus 2",
    ", one can find the rational points using an implementation by stoll @xcite of the chabauty - coleman method in the magma computational algebra system ; this works when the mordell - weil group of the jacobian is generated by one known point .",
    "the manin - demjanenko method ( @xcite,@xcite ) is effective and applies to curves @xmath8 defined over a number field @xmath0 that admit @xmath9 morphisms @xmath10 from @xmath11 to an abelian variety @xmath2 all defined over @xmath0 and linearly independent modulo constants ( in the sense that if @xmath12 is constant for some integers @xmath13 , then @xmath14 for all @xmath15 ) .",
    "if @xmath16 , then @xmath17 is finite and may be found effectively .",
    "however the method is far from being explicit in the sense that it does not give the dependence of the height of the rational points , neither on the curve nor on the morphisms ; this makes it difficult for applications .",
    "see serre @xcite for a description of the method and a few applications . in the papers of kulesz @xcite , girard and kulesz @xcite and kulesz , matera and schost @xcite",
    "this method has been used to find all rational points on some families of curves of genus 2 ( respectively 3 ) with morphisms to special elliptic curves of rank 1 ( respectively @xmath18 ) .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the curves have jacobian with factors isogenous to @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a square - free integer and such that the mordell - weil group has rank one .",
    "we also mention that viada gave in @xcite an effective method which is comparable with the setting of manin - demjanenko s result , although different in strategy .",
    "she obtains an effective height bound for the @xmath0-rational points on a transverse curve @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an elliptic curve with @xmath0-rank at most @xmath23 .",
    "also in this case the bounds are not at all explicit and there are no examples .",
    "a major shortcoming of these methods is that in general the bounds for the height must be worked out case by case and this is feasible in practice only when the equations of the curve are of a very special shape .    in this article",
    "we provide a sharp explicit upper bound for the height of the points in the intersection of a curve of genus at least @xmath5 in @xmath24 with the union of all algebraic subgroups of dimension one , where @xmath22 is an elliptic curve without cm ( complex multiplication ) , proving in this setting the explicit mordell - lang conjecture for points of rank one . with some further technical estimates ,",
    "the method works also for the cm case .",
    "our method can be easily applied to find the rational points on curves of a fairly general shape and growing genus .",
    "moreover we present a variety of explicit examples , given by curves of genus at least @xmath5 embedded in @xmath25 , with @xmath22 without cm and @xmath26 of rank one .",
    "these are precisely the curves whose jacobian has a factor isogenous to such an @xmath25 .",
    "so the method can be easily applied to curves embedded in @xmath27 , where @xmath2 is an abelian variety .",
    "this is also the first nontrivial setting , as the case of @xmath26 of rank zero can be easily treated ( see theorem [ prop.transv.a ] and remark [ rem.rank0 ] ) .",
    "many explicit examples mentioned above can be covered by our method , but it also gives many new examples never approached before , as the genus of our curves grows and ranges up to 40000 in our explicit examples .    compared to the other effective methods , ours is easier to apply because it provides a simple formula for the bound for the height of the rational points .",
    "in addition our method works over a number field @xmath0 and not only over @xmath7 .",
    "finally , in our settings the method of chabauty - coleman can not be directly applied , as the rank of the @xmath0-rational points of the ambient variety is not smaller than its dimension .",
    "our assumption is instead compatible with the manin - demjanenko setting .",
    "the importance of the result is that the dependence of our bound for the height is completely explicit both on the curve @xmath8 and the elliptic curve @xmath22 and it can be directly computed from the coefficients of the equations defining the curve .",
    "more precisely , it depends explicitly on the coefficients of a weierstrass equation for @xmath22 and on the degree and normalised height of @xmath8 .    to give some evidence of the power of our method",
    "we carry out in this paper the following applications :    * the proof of the explicit mordell conjecture for several families of curves , * the list of all rational points for more than @xmath28 explicit curves .",
    "to state our main theorem , we first fix the setting ( see section [ notaz ] for more details ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be an elliptic curve given in the form @xmath29 via the given equation , we embed @xmath24 into @xmath30 and via the segre embedding in @xmath31 .",
    "the degree of a curve @xmath21 is the degree of its image in @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the normalised height of @xmath8 , which is defined in terms of the chow form of the ideal of @xmath8 , as done in @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath33 be the nron - tate height on @xmath24 .",
    "we finally give the definition of rank for a point of @xmath24 as the @xmath34-rank of the ring generated by its coordinates or more in general :    [ rank ] the rank of a point in an abelian variety @xmath2 is the minimal dimension of a torsion variety containing the point .",
    "we can now state our main result :    [ caso_e^n ]    let @xmath22 be an elliptic curve without cm .",
    "let @xmath8 be an irreducible curve of genus at least @xmath5 embedded in @xmath24 .",
    "then every point @xmath35 of rank at most one on @xmath8 has nron - tate height bounded as @xmath36    moreover if @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined in table [ table1 ] and depend explicitely on the coefficients of @xmath22 .",
    "several sharper special versions of this theorem , vital for the applications , and other more intrinsic and general formulations are discussed in section [ nuova ] .",
    "theorem [ caso_e^n ] is a simple consequence , with less sharp but more compact constants , of theorem [ maint ] proven in section [ dimthmmain ] and theorem [ is ] proven in section [ nuova ] .",
    "we remark that if @xmath26 has rank one then the set of @xmath0-rational points of @xmath8 is contained in the set of points of rank one and so it has height bounded as above .",
    "we underline that our method to bound the height of the rational points does not require the knowledge of a generator for @xmath26 to work and that the bound we obatin is also independent on @xmath0 .",
    "these aspects are rather important , specifically for applications .",
    "our search for effective and even explicit methods for the height of the @xmath0-rational points on curves started some years ago in the context of the torsion anomalous conjecture ( in short tac ) , introduced by bombieri , masser and zannier @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this very general conjecture on the finiteness of the maximal torsion anomalous varieties implies the mordell - lang conjecture and effective results in the context of the tac carry over to effective cases of the mordell - lang conjecture ( see @xcite for a survey and @xcite also for related problems and references ) .",
    "effective methods in this context are rare and ours is probably the first explicit one in the setting of abelian varieties .",
    "our main theorem generalises and drastically improves a previous result obtained in @xcite where we considered only weak - transverse curves ( see definition [ deftrans ] ) , a stronger assumption which does not cover all curves of genus @xmath42 and we could only bound the height of the subset of points of rank one which are also torsion anomalous . in spite of the more restrictive setting , the bounds obtained in @xcite are much worse than the present ones and they are beyond any hope of implementing them in any concrete case .",
    "for instance , in this article , theorem [ is ] , for weak - transverse curves in @xmath24 with @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 while in @xcite under the same hypothesis we got @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "note that not only the constants here are linear instead of exponential in @xmath47 , but also the exponents of @xmath48 are now independent of @xmath47 and better already for @xmath49 .    by introducing new key elements in the proof ,",
    "we achieve in this article what we could not do in @xcite ; this change in approach leads to striking refinements of the bounds and makes them implementable .",
    "this is a sketch of the proof of the main theorem given in sections [ deduz ] and [ dimthmmain ] . at first instance",
    "we avoid to restrict ourselves to the concept of torsion anomalous points as done in @xcite and study in a more abstract way all points of rank one . to tackle the case of a general @xmath47 , we use an optimal geometric induction on @xmath47 which keeps the invariants as small as possible .",
    "the base of the induction is given by @xmath37 .",
    "in this case we do a typical proof of diophantine approximation : if @xmath35 is a point in @xmath25 of rank one , we construct a subgroup @xmath50 of dimension 1 such that the height and the degree of the translate @xmath51 are well controlled . to this aim",
    "some classical applications of the geometry of numbers must be replaced by a new argument to get sharper estimates , which keep the bounds from growing beyond the computational limits of a computer search .",
    "we then conclude the proof using the arithmetic bzout theorem , the zhang inequality and an optimal choice of the parameters .",
    "another significant feature of our main theorem is that it can easily be applied to find the rational points on curves of quite general shape .",
    "we present here some of its nice applications , remarking that , for instance , any curve of genus at least @xmath5 in @xmath25 with @xmath52 of rank one is suitable for further examples of our method .",
    "let @xmath22 be an elliptic curve defined over @xmath53 .",
    "we write @xmath54 for the equations of @xmath25 in @xmath55",
    "using affine coordinates @xmath56 and we embed @xmath25 in @xmath57 via the segre embedding .    in section [ sez : criterio ]",
    "we give a method to construct several families of curves in @xmath25 of growing genus and we show how to compute bounds for their degree and normalized height . in theorem [ caso_poly ] we prove a sharper version of the following result .",
    "[ polyintro ] assume that @xmath22 is without cm , defined over a number field @xmath0 and that @xmath26 has rank one .",
    "let @xmath8 be the projective closure of the curve given in @xmath25 by the additional equation @xmath58 with @xmath59 $ ] a non - constant polynomial of degree @xmath60 .",
    "then for @xmath61 we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the height of the coefficients of @xmath64 , and the constants @xmath65 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we then consider two specific families which have particularly small invariants .",
    "clearly these are just examples and many similar others can be given .",
    "[ defcn][defdn ] let @xmath66 be the family of the projective closures of the curves in @xmath25 defined for @xmath67 via the additional equation @xmath68 let @xmath69 be the family of the projective closures of the curves in @xmath25 defined for @xmath67 via the additional equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the @xmath60-th cyclotomic polynomial .",
    "in order to directly apply our main theorem we cut these curves on @xmath25 , with @xmath22 varying in the set of elliptic curves over @xmath7 without cm and @xmath7-rank one .",
    "several examples of such @xmath22 have been tabulated below and others can be easily found , for instance in cremona s tables @xcite .",
    "we consider the following elliptic curves : @xmath72    these are five elliptic curves without cm and of rank one over @xmath7 .",
    "the curves @xmath73 are , respectively , the curves 248c.1,10014b.1 , 360009g.1 and 360006h.2 of @xcite .",
    "the curve @xmath74 was considered by silverman in @xcite , example 3 and it does not appear in the cremona tables because its conductor is too big .",
    "choosing an elliptic curve of rank one with generator of large height with respect to the coefficients of its weierstrass equation may speed - up the computations , but it is not necessary ( see section [ secex2 ] for more details )    a remarkable application of our theorem is the following result , proven in section [ secex2 ] . if @xmath22 is an elliptic curve , we denote by @xmath75 its neutral element .",

    "the computations have been executed with the computer algebra system pari / gp @xcite using an algorithm by k. belabas discussed in section [ secex2 ] based on a sieving method .",

    "the 40000 curves @xmath94 in @xmath96 took about @xmath97 days , while the computations on the 4500 curves @xmath98 took about three weeks .",
    "a single curve in this range takes between a few seconds and a few minutes , for example @xmath99 in @xmath100 takes about 6.8 seconds .",
    "for a few curves in which the bounds are particularly small , we first used a naive algorithm , which took about 6 weeks for each curve @xmath101 .",
    "then we used a floating point algorithm suggested by j. silverman : for each @xmath102 this algorithm took about one week for the 10 curves @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "the striking improvement in the running time is due to the idea of performing the computations after reducing modulo many primes ; arithmetic operations in finite fields are much faster than exact arithmetic .",
    "more details on how to construct suitable new examples are given in section [ sez : criterio ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : sections [ notaz ] and [ altezze ] contain the notations , definitions and some useful standard results . in section [ deduz ]",
    "we state theorem [ maint ] which is a sharper version of our main result for curves in @xmath25 .",
    "this is crucial for the applications and we use it to prove theorem [ caso_e^n ] . section [ dimthmmain ] is dedicated to the proof of theorem [ maint ] .",
    "sections [ sez : criterio][secex2 ] are devoted to describe the families of examples and applications of our main method , proving in particular theorem [ polyintro ] and theorem [ curveesp ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the notations that we will use in the rest of the article . we define different heights and , among the main technical tools in the theory of height , we recall the arithmetic bzout theorem and the zhang inequality .",
    "we also recall some standard facts on subgroups of @xmath24 and give some basic estimates for the degree of the kernel of morphisms on @xmath24 .",

    "then we define the following program , that we indent here for readability    .... 0    e = ellinit([a , b ] ) ; 1    d = abs(e.disc ) ; 2    sievea ( ) =   3    { 4      p = nextprime(ba ) ; 5      l = [ 1 .. ba ] ; 6      cnt = 1 ; 7      while(1 ,   8        if(d%p==0,next ) ; 9        if(denominator(g[1])%p==0,next ) ; 10       oldnl = # l ; 11       ag = [ 0 ] ; 12       ep = ellinit(e , p ) ; 13       lp = list ( [ ] ) ; 14       for ( a = 1 , ba , 15         ag = elladd(ep , ag , g ) ; 16         if ( # ag = = 1 , listput(lp , a ) ; next ) ; 17         x = ag[1 ] ; 18         xp = mod(x , p ) ;   19         if(polrootsmod('x^3 + a*'x + b - pol(xp)^2 , p ) , listput(lp , a ) ) ; 20       ) ; 21       listsort(lp ) ; 22       l = setintersect(l , vec(lp ) ) ; 23       if ( # l = = oldnl , cnt++ , cnt = 0 ) ; 24       if ( # l = = 0 || cnt > ntest , break ) ; 25       p = nextprime(p+1 ) ; 26     ) ; 27     printf(\"l=%s\\n\",l ) ; 28   } ....    the core of the algorithm is the ` while ` loop in line 7 .",
    "this loop iterates over the prime ` p ` , which is initialised in line 3 to a value bigger than ` ba ` . at each iteration",
    "the algorithm takes the list ` l ` , which initially contains all positive values of @xmath20 up to the bound ` ba ` , and checks for which of these values there exists a point @xmath691g,[b]g)$ ] on the curve @xmath94 reduced modulo ` p ` .",
    "this check is done in the ` for ` loop at line 13 . the @xmath20 that correspond to points modulo ` p ` are stored in the list ` lp ` and the values of @xmath20 that do not correspond to a point are removed from the list ` l ` at line 21 .",
    "the algorithm then changes the prime number ` p ` to the next one , and the loop starts again .",
    "the check at lines 8 and 9 ensures that the primes of bad reduction for the curve ` e ` and those that divide the denominator of the generator are discarded .",
    "the algorithm keeps sieving through the list ` l ` until either the list becomes empty , which proves that there are no rational points , or ` ntest ` iterations pass without any value of @xmath20 being discarded . when this happens the program outputs these values of @xmath20 , which are candidate solutions and need to be investigated further .    in our explicit examples we found that setting ` ntest ` to 25 was enough , and",
    "no candidate solution was ever found other than those arising from rational points on @xmath694 .",
    "the variable ` ba ` , and hence the length of the list ` l ` in line 5 , is directly proportional to the square root of the height of the coefficients of the weierstrass model of @xmath22 and inversely proportional to the square root of the height of the generator of @xmath52 , which explains the speed improvement when the generator has a big height compared to the coefficients .",
    "we remark that with a simple modification this algorithm can be made deterministic by stopping the iteration in a suitably - chosen way depending on the degree and the coefficients of the curve .",
    "however this increases , in general , the running time compared to a good heuristic choice of the parameter ` ntest ` .",
    "when adapting the algorithm to other examples , if for a certain choice of ` ntest ` the above algorithm returns a list of possible values , one can either increase ` ntest ` or directly check the values with the floating point algorithm .",
    "+ we finally notice that for our method it is not necessary to know _ a priori _ a generator @xmath457 of @xmath52 .",
    "indeed we can argue as follows .",
    "theorem [ caso_poly ] gives the bound @xmath695 for any rational point on @xmath8 .",
    "thus we only need to search for a generator @xmath457 of @xmath52 such that @xmath696 , otherwise @xmath697 is trivially empty . to this purpose , one can use a suitable search algorithm for generators of height at most @xmath698 on elliptic curves of rank one , as described in @xcite .",
    "for instance with silverman s canonical height search algorithm finding a generator of @xmath52 takes about @xmath699 , where @xmath700 is the conductor of @xmath22 .",
    "this is also one of the few algorithms that can deal with curves of high conductor .",
