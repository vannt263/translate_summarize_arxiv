    "entanglement is an effect that has been under a great deal of scrutiny since @xmath2 , when einstein , podolsky and rosen and ( independently ) schrdinger introduced it as a purely quantum phenomenon without any counterpart in classical physics . although counterintuitive by its nature , entanglement is a real physical effect that has been experimentally demonstrated through violation of bell s inequalities , experiments on teleportation , dense coding and entanglement swapping .",
    "most recently , entanglement has been shown to affect macroscopic properties of solids , such as its magnetization and heat capacity @xcite .",
    "this effect is observed only at low temperature , nevertheless , it is still impressive that a virtually macroscopic system can feel effects of purely quantum correlations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore a general method of quantifying and bounding total correlations in any such physical system .",
    "a great deal of effort has gone into theoretically understanding and quantifying entanglement @xcite .",
    "there is a large number of different measures proposed , however , we have recently argued that based on the very natural local processes and classical communication we should not expect to find a unique measure of entanglement even for mixed bi - partite states @xcite . therefore , different measures capture different aspects of entanglement , but no measure can capture all aspects .",
    "this apparent ambiguity will not present a problem for us here as will be seen shortly .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study multipartite thermal entanglement in general solid state systems .",
    "many investigations have recently been conducted in this direction @xcite , and entanglement is found to be present under some circumstance and has been linked to the existence of critical phenomena .",
    "however , all of the work so far uses some form or other of bipartite measures of entanglement .",
    "this is because we have an almost complete understanding of bipartite entanglement and can even compute its amount exactly . in this paper ,",
    "on the other hand , we will be addressing genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "the measure that we will use is the relative entropy of entanglement which is the only current measure that can be consistently used for any number of particles and dimensions .",
    "the key result of this paper will be a derivation of an upper bound on the amount of total correlation in a thermal state of any macroscopic system .",
    "this will , of course , be a bound on the amount of entanglement as well , since entanglement is a special case ( i.e. the quantum part ) of correlations .",
    "we will apply the derived bound to two simple interacting systems of qubits and analyse the limitations of our method .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the bound not being exact , we are still able to see regions of criticality . at the end",
    ", we will discuss the correspondence between @xmath0 dimensional quantum interaction systems and @xmath1 dimensional classical systems and examine its implications on the existence of macroscopic thermal entanglement .",
    "in the remaining part we introduce the measures of information that will be used throughout .",
    "we first introduce the quantum ( von neumann ) mutual information , which refers to the correlation between two quantum subsystems .",
    "the quantum mutual information between the two subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the joint state @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the von neumann entropy . for us",
    "very useful will be the fact that this quantity can be interpreted as a distance between the two quantum states @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we define the quantum relative entropy , in a direct analogy with the classical ( shannon ) relative entropy @xcite .",
    "the quantum relative entropy between the two states @xmath8 and @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 this measure has a very important application in statistical discrimination of the two states , but this role will not be of concern to us here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what is important is that the quantum mutual information can be understood as a distance of the state @xmath11 to the uncorrelated state @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 the larger this value , the more correlated the state @xmath11 .",
    "the main advantage of looking at the mutual information as a distance measure , is that it can be generalized in this way to many particles .",
    "another advantage is that it can be applied to quantify multipartite entanglement @xcite as will be seen later .",
    "this applicability to many parties is precisely what we need to be able to quantify correlations in a large ( macroscopic ) piece of solid ( in the thermodynamical limit , when the number of constituents tends to infinity ) .",
    "a completely uncorrelated state of @xmath16 systems would be of the form @xmath17 , and the difference between a given state @xmath9 and this state would represent the amount of correlation present .",
    "so , the muliparty mutual information is given by @xcite @xmath18 note that only the individual entropies and the total entropy are involved in this calculation .",
    "there is no need to look at the two , three or more subsystems and their entropies .",
    "note also that this presents an upper bound to total entanglement in the state @xmath9 .",
    "intuitively speaking this is because entanglement is only a part of total correlations , and so it has to be smaller than the total correlations .",
    "mathematically , we will show this in the text below .",
    "we would like to discuss the role that these measures of information play in various models of interacting systems in statistical physics . before we do that",
    ", we first review how entropies can be used to generalize and formalize the notion of the mean field approximation .",
    "the term  mean field approximation \" can have various meanings in statistical mechanics and it actually refers to a whole set of different approximations all with different levels of accuracy ( due to weiss , bethe , etc @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea is to ignore the fact that the constituents of the solid under investigation are interacting and treat the interaction as an  average effect \" .",
    "the difference between approximations lies in the way we perform the averaging . in this section",
    "we explain one method of doing so that will be used later in the paper .",
    "the aforementioned bound presented here will , however , be valid for any mean field approximation .",
    "we will discuss the limits and failures of this method in section vi , but see @xcite for a general discussion of the limits of any mean - filed approximation .",
    "we would like to stress that we will not at all make any new contribution here to the mean field approximation ; our aim is to use the existing theory to quantify multipartite correlations .",
    "the key quantity in statistical mechanics that allows us to derive thermodynamical properties of the system under study is free energy .",
    "once this quantity is known we can , by differentiation with respect to suitable parameters , derive all other thermodynamical variables , such as pressure , energy , magnetization and so forth .",
    "the free energy is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 is the temperature and @xmath22 is the partition function . in order to calculate the partition function we need to know the energy levels of the system , @xmath23 , and then perform the following sum - over - states : @xmath24 if the state we are considering is a quantum mechanical density matrix in a thermal state , then the partition function is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hamiltonian and @xmath27 .",
    "only quantum models will concern us here and so this is the expression of the partition function that will be used .",
    "the partition function is easy to calculate if the energy levels are known , but for most interesting cases this can not be done exactly . hence various approximations must be used . before going into the general theory of how this calculation of @xmath22 is performed ,",
    "we first present a very simple example , to illustrate the main point .",
    "interacting systems are frequently very difficult to treat in statistical mechanics simply because there are no known analytic methods for evaluating the partition function in general .",
    "therefore , we most likely have to resort to some kind of approximations .",
    "one of the well known ways of doing this is to write the hamiltonian of the interacting system as a sum of non - interacting hamiltonians for individual spins .",
    "the effect of interaction is incorporated in as the average field produced by all the other spins . here",
    "is how this method works for a simple one dimensional ising model .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is given by : @xmath28 this model has been widely used to investigate various properties of real solids @xcite . it can be solved exactly , but for educational purposes we will illustrate how to solve it using the mean field approximation .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean value of the neighboring spins and there are @xmath31 of them ( but we have also divided by @xmath31 not to double count ! ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is of course much easier to treat than the original one and its eigenvalues can immediately be found to be @xmath32 .",
    "therefore it is easy to obtain the mean field partition function and hence all the other thermodynamical properties , which is why the mean field approximation is so extensively used .",
    "but , how do we find the value of @xmath30 which is necessary for being able to use this approximation ?",
    "the value of @xmath30 is given by @xmath33 , but we have assumed that @xmath26 is difficult to handle .",
    "so , instead , we use the following formula @xmath34 since @xmath35 is very easy to handle .",
    "the dipole @xmath30 here really points in the @xmath36 direction only , but this is because we are considering a simple system .",
    "in the subsequent sections we will have to compute averages of other pauli operators as well . this will result in a transcendental equation and for this problem in particular we have that @xmath37 which can not be solved analytically .",
    "when the external field is absent ( @xmath38 ) we have that the equality can be maintained only for some range of values of @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , this range is @xmath40 , which leads to a critical temperature of @xmath41 .",
    "of course , one dimensional models do not have phase transitions , and so the mean field incorrectly predicts the existence of the critical temperature , but nevertheless , in general this approximation turns out to be useful ( especially in higher dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "we will use it to give us an upper bound on the amount of correlations and entanglement present in interacting systems .    for convenience",
    "we will use the following dimensionless quantities in the paper @xmath42 and @xmath43 . note that this will imply , for example , that the limit of @xmath44 becoming large can be reached in two different ways : @xmath45 fixed and temperature tending to zero , or , @xmath21 fixed and @xmath45 increasing to infinity .",
    "although these are different physically , they will invariably lead to the same result simply because only the ratio of the field strength and temperature will appear in the formulae and never the two quantities independently .",
    "we first discuss an important application of relative entropy to mean field theory .",
    "we describe for the sake of completeness a general method for approximating the free energy which is due to bogoliubov",
    ". we will be interested not so much in his method for computing the free energy as in the way that this can provide us with an upper bound on total correlations in the system and hence its entanglement .",
    "needless to say , this was not bogoliubov s original motivation .",
    "we start from the fact that the relative entropy is always a positive quantity , @xmath46 where ( in this paper ) we specialise to thermal states of the form @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the entropy of either of these matrices is easy to compute .",
    "for example , @xmath49 note that the last term in the above equation is just @xmath50 times the average value of energy @xmath51 .",
    "the subscript @xmath26 in our notation means that the average is done with respect to the state @xmath9 which is a thermal state generated by the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "it is now straightforward to see how to compute the relative entropy between the real and mean field thermal states . after a short calculation",
    "we have : @xmath52 where , as discussed before , @xmath53 . from the positivity of the relative entropy",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath54 this is one of the bogoliubov inequalities . for completeness",
    ", we also derive its  mirror image \" .",
    "namely , we can always use the relative entropy the other way round @xmath55 , which then implies that @xmath56 we can combine the two inequalities into a single expression to obtain @xmath57 we can also express this inequality via the free energy , @xmath58 , in which case we obtain the so called bogoliubov inequalities : @xmath59 the purpose of this is the following .",
    "suppose that we would like to approximate the partition function ( or alternatively the free energy ) because the true one can not easily be computed .",
    "this implies that  free \" parameters in the mean field hamiltonian should be varied so that the expression @xmath60 is minimised .",
    "since this expression has as its lower bound the true value of the free energy ( this is the statement of the bogoliubov inequality ) , that means that by finding the minimum we are performing the best possible approximation ( within this method , of course ) . we can alternatively maximize the left hand side .",
    "this method is very general and has been used many times since exactly solvable models are very rare in statistical mechanics .",
    "we will not directly be using this bound here , but will instead show how to use it to bound the amount of correlations in any thermal state .",
    "we will now apply the formalism presented above to put a bound on the multipartite mutual information and entanglement using the free energy and internal energy .",
    "this will allow us to establish a relationship between the observable , macroscopic thermodynamical quantities and the amount of correlations in a given solid .    as we have already stated ,",
    "once we have the partition function all other thermodynamical quantities can be derived @xcite .",
    "for example , the magnetic susceptibility is given by @xmath61 this quantity tells us the change in magnetization of the material as the external field @xmath45 is increased .",
    "microscopically , we have that the susceptibility is , in fact , a sum over all microscopic spin correlation functions @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the spin correlation function between the sites @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is a very important relation as it connects a macroscopic quantity @xmath66 to its microscopic roots in the form of the two - site correlation functions @xmath63",
    ". we will show how entanglement , which fundamentally exists at the level of the microscopic correlations function , can  propagate \" in its effects to the macroscopic level of @xmath66",
    ". we will not be using the quantity @xmath63 in any fundamental way in the paper so that we will not need to give its precise definition .",
    "suffice it to say that any other thermodynamical quantity can in a similar way be derived from the free energy ( partition function ) and the interested reader is advised to consult further any textbook on statistical mechanics such as @xcite . here",
    "we will only be concerned will multiparty correlations whose link to thermodynamics is much clearer than that of two - site entanglement .",
    "we now define a particular measure of entanglement that has been extensively used in the literature @xcite and is also appropriate for our considerations .",
    "if @xmath67 is the set of all disentangled ( separable ) states ( of the form @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are some probabilities ) , the measure of entanglement for a state @xmath8 is then defined to be the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the quantum relative entropy defined in eq .",
    "( [ relent ] ) .",
    "this measure tells us that the amount of entanglement present in the state @xmath8 is equal to its distance from the disentangled set of states .",
    "note that this definition is , in spirit , a direct generalization of the mutual information .",
    "whereas mutual information measures the distance of the state to the closest uncorrelated state , the relative entropy of entanglement measures its distance to the closest classically ( but not quantumly ) correlated state .",
    "it is therefore immediately clear that @xmath72 ( by definition ) .",
    "we will now use the equation that we introduced in the previous section @xmath52 to show to what extent susceptibility is dependent on entanglement .",
    "our consideration is completely general and can be applied in any situation in statistical mechanics .",
    "suppose that the mean field theory gives us the closest separable state @xmath73 .",
    "this is not a very good assumption in general as the state in mean field theory will be completely uncorrelated and a separable state can still have some classical correlations .",
    "this , in fact , is the advantage of the mean field approach : by neglecting correlations we can then write down a hamiltonian whose spectrum is much easier to find ( it boils down to diagonalising a two by two matrix for the one dimensional ising and heisenberg models ) .",
    "however , if for the sake of argument , the mean field gives us the closest separable state , then from the above equality we can conclude that @xmath74 this is a very convenient expression since it reduces the total amount of entanglement in the state @xmath9 to calculations of the energy and free energy of the state and its mean field approximation .",
    "moreover , by differentiating twice with respect to @xmath45 we can conclude that @xmath75 therefore the difference in the susceptibilities between our approximation and the true value is directly proportional to ( the second derivative of ) the amount of entanglement in the state @xmath9 .",
    "it is thus clear that in general this entanglement will have macroscopic effect on quantities such as the susceptibility ( as well as other quantities ) .",
    "this offers a more general and formal theoretical justification for the observations in @xcite .",
    "although this equality is very suggestive from the conceptual perspective , it is most likely useless from the practical point of view of computing the amount of entanglement .",
    "this is because it is very difficult to compute the form of the closest separable state to a given entangled state .",
    "what is possible , thought , and can be very useful as well , is to calculate the mean field approximation .",
    "so in general our approximation to @xmath9 is not likely to be the closest separable state , but some completely uncorrelated state instead .",
    "then we have the following inequality : @xmath76 this is an upper bound on the amount of entanglement whatever @xmath73 we choose . in fact , the right hand side will more appropriately be describing the total multi - partite mutual information",
    ". we would like to illustrate the usefulness of this formalism using the one dimensional ising model in a transverse field . before that",
    ", we analyze a much simpler model of two qubits interacting through a heisenberg coupling .",
    "thermal entanglement properties of two qubits coupled through a heisenberg interaction are very easily understood .",
    "the hamiltonian for the 1d heisenberg chain in a constant external magnetic field @xmath45 , is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 in which @xmath79 are the pauli matrices for the @xmath64th spin .",
    "the regimes @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic cases respectively .",
    "the state of the above system at thermal equilibrium ( temperature @xmath21 ) is @xmath82 where , as before , @xmath22 is the partition function and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the factor half in @xmath83 is there for consistency reasons with the later notation .",
    "we first examine the @xmath31 qubit antiferromagnetic chain . since this is only a two qubit mixed state we can compute entanglement of formation exactly .",
    "we can also compute the mutual information exactly and so , there is no need to use any approximate methods .",
    "however , we will use the bound previously derived just to illustrate the method and compare it to the exact values . before that",
    ", we review the exact results following the paper by arnesen et al @xcite .    for @xmath38 , the singlet is the ground state and the triplets are the degenerate excited states . in this case , the maximum entanglement is at @xmath84 and it decreases with @xmath21 due to mixing of the triplets with the singlet . for a higher value of @xmath45 ,",
    "however , the triplet states split , and @xmath85 becomes the ground state . in that case",
    "there is no entanglement at @xmath84 , but increasing @xmath21 increases entanglement by bringing in some singlet component into the mixture . on the other hand , as @xmath45 is increased at @xmath84 , the entanglement vanishes suddenly as @xmath45 crosses a critical value of @xmath86 when @xmath85 becomes the ground state .",
    "this special point @xmath87 , at which entanglement undergoes a sudden change with variation of @xmath45 , is the point of a _ quantum phase transition _",
    "( phase transitions taking place at zero temperature due to variation of interaction terms in the hamiltonian of a system ) . note that this is , strictly speaking , not a real phase transition which can only appear in the infinite @xmath88 limit .",
    "this is because for any finite @xmath88 entanglement function ( as well as all the other thermodynamic functions ) are analytic . at any finite @xmath21",
    ", however , entanglement decays off analytically after @xmath45 crosses @xmath89 . in the ferromagnetic case",
    ", the state of the system at @xmath38 and @xmath84 is an equal mixture of the three triplet states .",
    "this state is disentangled . increasing @xmath45 increases the proportion of @xmath85 in the state which can not make it entangled . increasing @xmath21 increases the proportion of singlet in the state which can only decrease entanglement by mixing with the triplet",
    "thus we never find any entanglement in the @xmath90qubit ferromagnet .",
    "these features of the @xmath90qubit heisenberg model are also present in the @xmath88 qubit model @xcite .",
    "let us now apply the bound previously derive and see how well it agrees with the exact results .",
    "this is , of course , just an exercise in computing and testing the bound rather than having any practical purpose .",
    "it is convenient to do it simply because we have all the results we need and the model is really very easy to understand . on the other hand , it captures some important features of more complicated models and , therefore , it will prepare us for the next section . for us of great importance is that the eigenvalues of the thermal state are easily found to be @xmath91 , the first three corresponding to the triplet states and the last to the singlet state . the partition function",
    "is then computed to be : @xmath92 in order to compute the bound , the second step is to establish the mean field hamiltonian .",
    "one possibility is the hamiltonian of the form @xmath93 for each of the two spins .",
    "the total hamiltonian is just the sum of the above for each of the spins , and the values @xmath94 are the mean field average values of the spin in the @xmath95 and @xmath36 direction .",
    "the eigenvalues of the mean field hamiltonian are @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding partition function is then also easily computed to be @xmath97 the ultimate square in the expression comes from the fact that there are two spins and each has the same identical individual partition function .",
    "the final quantities we have to calculate are the averages of the two hamiltonians .",
    "we obtain for the average of @xmath26 , @xmath98 on the other hand , we can also calculate the average mean - filed energy to be @xmath99 we now need an estimate for the average spin values @xmath94 .",
    "this is done by computing the averages of the corresponding pauli operators for the mean - filed state . strictly speaking ,",
    "the averages should be computed with respect to the original state @xmath9 , but this is in practice difficult to handle and it is the reason for using the mean field approximation in the first place .",
    "thus we have to settle for computing the following averages @xmath100 and @xmath101 therefore only the average in the @xmath36 direction is non - zero . here",
    "we are somewhat unusually lucky and there is no @xmath102 variable on the right hand side .",
    "therefore , given @xmath103 and @xmath44 , the corresponding @xmath102 is very easy to calculate .",
    "this is in general not the case as we have seen in eq .",
    "( [ mean field ] ) .",
    "we have plotted the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath20 and @xmath44 in fig .",

    "note that there is a transition beyond the line @xmath105 , for which the value of magnetisation becomes zero .",
    "this will be reflected in the behaviour of the bound on mutual information as will be seen in the next figure .",
    "putting all these results together , the upper bound on correlations ( entanglement ) in eq .",
    "( [ upperbound ] ) is now given by @xmath106 we have plotted this bound in fig .",
    "2 . we can see that it has reasonable behaviour , in the sense that , for example , it increases with @xmath103 as we expect correlations to increase with increasing interaction .",
    "note that there is an increase in the value of the bound when @xmath107 .",
    "this is interesting when compared with the behaviour of entanglement .",
    "like we said before , entanglement also undergoes a transformation from a non - zero value to a zero value at this point as argued before @xcite .",
    "we can also see some unreasonable behaviour from our approximation : the bound can be larger than @xmath31 , but the mutual information between two qubits can never exceed this amount .",
    "for some values of @xmath103 and @xmath44 , therefore , the bound becomes trivial ( it is not wrong strictly speaking , but it just becomes useless ) .",
    "note that for @xmath108 the bound also becomes zero , and hence there are no correlations between the spins .",

    "we can compare the bound to the true value of mutual information ( which should be lower unless the mean - filed approximation leads exactly to the closest product state ! ) .",

    "we can see that our bound is always greater than this value ( as it should be ! ) .",
    "fig 4 shows the difference between the bound on correlations and the actual mutual information .",
    "note that for @xmath108 and in the vicinity of this region the bound still gives exact results .",
    "= 7.0 cm +    this figure shows the difference between the bound and the exact value of @xmath112 as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath44 .",
    "we are now in a position to apply our ideas to a much more complex model , whose features are still being investigated @xcite .",
    "this model has been extensively used in many situations and has been analyzed in various regimes @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of the hamiltonian which makes it different from the ordinary classical hamiltonian is that the interaction part of the hailtonian and the external field point in different mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "this makes the model more complex than if the two parts of the hamltonian were in the same direction ( as in the original ising model ) .",
    "one of the main consequences is that while there is never any entanglement present in the original hamiltonian model , the one in the transverse field can exhibit entanglement @xcite .    the one dimensional ising model in a transverse field",
    "is completely specified by the following hamiltonian : @xmath113 we first briefly summarize how to diagonalize this hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the main tools are the jordan - wigner transformation , followed by a fourier transform and finally followed by the bogoliubov transform .",
    "what this achieves is the following : the initial spins , which are localized fermions , are subsequently converted into highly non - local fermions and then the delocalized fermionic hamiltonian is easily diagonalised to find its spectrum . to simplify mathematics even further at this point",
    "we will divide the hamiltonian through by @xmath83 and use as the only variable @xmath114 , so that @xmath115 we will go back to the original hamiltonian , recovering @xmath45 and @xmath39 at the end when we present results of our calculations . the spin operators in this expression satisfy anticommutation rules at any given site ( just like fermions ) but follow commutation rules at separate sites ( again just like fermions ) .",
    "the non - local jordan - wigner transformation maps these operators into fully anticommuting spinless fermions defined by @xmath116 such that @xmath117 in terms of operators @xmath118 the above hamiltonian becomes @xmath119    we now introduce the fourier transformed ( fermionic ) operators d_k = _",
    "l=-+1 ^ -1 a_l e^-ikl , @xmath120 .",
    "due to the fact that this transformation is unitary , the anticommutation relations remain true for the new @xmath0-operators .",
    "the hamiltonian now takes an almost diagonal form , @xmath121 where an extra term , suppressed by @xmath122 , should be present .",
    "this terms clearly tends to zero as @xmath123 and we can therefore safely omit it as all our results will refer to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a final unitary transformation is now necessary to cast the hamiltonian into a manifestly diagonal form .",
    "this so - called bogoliubov transformation can be expressed as @xmath124 where @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "again , due to unitarity of the bogoliubov transformation the @xmath127-operators follow the usual anticommutation relations .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian takes the following diagonal form @xmath128 where @xmath129 the thermodynamical limit is obtained by defining @xmath130 and taking the @xmath123 limit @xmath131 with @xmath132 we have in the last step reintroduced the @xmath103 and the @xmath44 parameter in order to recover the field and interaction dependence which will be important in our subsequent analysis .",
    "the exact partition function can from here immediately be calculated ( this was originally done by katsura @xcite ) . in the large @xmath88 limit ( which is what we are always interested in",
    "when it comes to computing thermodynamical quantities ) we have @xmath133    we now need to construct a mean field hamiltonian .",
    "let us try to approximate this hamiltonian with the following one : @xmath134 this hamiltonian is completely local and its eigenstates can not be entangled ( not even classically correlated ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is meant to approximate the effect of all other spins on the spin @xmath135 .",
    "we will at the moment leave the value of @xmath30 undetermined .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath136 are easily computed to be : @xmath137 the mean field partition function is , therefore , given by @xmath138 where , as before , @xmath139 and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath88-th power again reflects the fact that there are @xmath88 spins each of which has the same identical partition function .",
    "the free energy is in the mean field theory now proportional to @xmath140 in order to complete the upper bound on thermal entanglement for the whole chain we need to estimate the average of the difference between the mean filed hamiltonian and the true ising hamiltonian .",
    "the average of @xmath26 is known from the partition function and it is @xcite @xmath141 the final quantity left to calculate is the average of the mean field hamiltonian which requires us to compute the averages of @xmath142 and @xmath143 . the average of the former is known and it is @xmath144 the biggest problem presents now the calculation of the average of the @xmath143 operator . this value is not known analytically unless @xmath145 .",
    "so , instead of calculating this value exactly , we will assume that @xmath146 .",
    "putting all the results so far together we obtain the following bound on the amount on entanglement @xmath147    we now turn our attention to calculating the value of @xmath30 which is necessary in order to be able to used the above bound .",
    "again , we can not calculate the real value of @xmath30 in the state @xmath9 , but need to simplify and assume that @xmath148 .",
    "this means that we only need to calculate the average of @xmath143 in the mean field and this is a simple task . for this",
    "we need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the mean field hamiltonian .",
    "the former have already been used , and the latter are ( in general ) given by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     ( @xmath118 and @xmath127 are real ) , where it can be calculated that @xmath150 ( it turns out that we will only ever need the value of the product of @xmath118 and @xmath127 and not their individual values ) .",
    "the average value of the pauli @xmath151 operator is now : @xmath152 and this therefore presents the equation from which we should determine the value of @xmath30 .",
    "the algorithm for computing the upper bound on the total amount of entanglement is now the following :    * given the values of @xmath103 and @xmath44 , first compute the corresponding value of @xmath153 ; * then compute the value of the upper bound for the same three values of @xmath154 and @xmath30 .    we can , of course , always handle this problem numerically and some numerical results will indeed be presented .",
    "we will first discuss estimating the critical temperature beyond which we do not have the solution for the average magnetisation in the mean field approximation .",
    "even thought this is impossible to do analytically ( we have a transcendental equation ) , we can always look at some special cases .",
    "for example , when the external field vanishes , @xmath155 , we have that @xmath156 the solutions of this equation exist only if @xmath157 which implies that @xmath158 , @xmath20 being the boltzmann constant . in this case , we can numerically estimate that @xmath159 .",
    "note that if , on the other hand , @xmath108 , then it follows immediately that @xmath160 .",
    "it is also not so difficult to obtain other critical regions .",
    "for example , for @xmath161 , values of @xmath162 all yield the value of @xmath30 outside the acceptable region ( which is between @xmath104 and @xmath163 ) . in general , therefore , it is first important to investigate the domain of validity of the approximation before we can use the bound on correlations .    before we analyse the general values of the interaction , external field and temperature ,",
    "let us first investigate a few special cases which can be addressed immediately and analytically .",
    "first of all , as @xmath103 tends to zero ( while @xmath44 is kept finite ) , the value of the upper bound tends to zero .",
    "therefore , there is no entanglement present here .",
    "this is expected as the small @xmath103 limit implies that the external field dominates the interaction part and then the eigenstates become product states of all spins pointing in the @xmath36 direction which is a completely disentangled state ( this is why the average magnetization in the @xmath151 direction , @xmath30 , tends to zero as it is equally likely to point in the positive and negative directions ) .",
    "the opposite limit is when @xmath103 becomes large ( while @xmath44 is still kept finite ) .",
    "then , as the interaction dominates the external field , the state of the system approaches the product of spins all aligned and pointing in the @xmath151 direction ( the ground state is when all the spins assume the same eigenvalue of @xmath151 , the first excited states are the ones where one spin has the opposite @xmath151 value to the rest , and so on ) .",
    "therefore , we should expect no entanglement in this case , although it may seem surprising that a strong interaction ultimately does not produce entangled states . from the bound",
    "we obtain @xmath164 the mean field theory also implies that @xmath165 , and so entanglement indeed disappears as the bound tends to zero .",
    "the third special case we analyze is when @xmath166 .",
    "there are two different physical ways we can reach this limit .",
    "one is the keep the temperature constant and increase the external field and the interaction strength at the same rate .",
    "the other is to keep @xmath45 and @xmath39 fixed and decrease the temperature to zero . from the mean field approximation we can obtain the value of @xmath167 .",
    "this then gives us the bound on entanglement of @xmath168 the regime @xmath84 has been extensively studied @xcite and , as we discussed before , there is a quantum critical point of @xmath45 at which some thermodynamic potentials ( such as the free energy ) become non - analytic . at @xmath84 ,",
    "the critical region is when @xmath169 @xcite ( in other words this is the @xmath170 region , but both in the large limit .",
    "this behaviour is confirmed by our calculation as will be seen when we present plots of the bound .",
    "note , however , that the upper bound on information per spin grows linearly with @xmath103 .",
    "since the mutual information per spin can not be larger than the entropy of the spin , which is maximally equal to @xmath171 , this means that the bound becomes useless once @xmath103 is greater than @xmath172 .",
    "this number has only approximately been calculated and in the limit of large @xmath103 , nevertheless , there will still be a cut - off of this kind beyond which our approximation is no longer useful ( although it is still , of course , valid , but only trivially ) .    in the case of the heisenberg model with two qubits we compared the bound to the exact value of the mutual information .",
    "can we do the same here ?",
    "the answer is that in general this is not possible .",
    "some special cases can be addressed ( such as the zero temperature , ground state entanglement and entropies as in @xcite ) , but for any generic values of @xmath173 it seems to be very difficult to obtain the single spin density matrix . in particular , while we are able to compute the average value of @xmath142 , there is no way of computing the @xmath151 and the @xmath174 components necessary to fully infer the state .",
    "this therefore prevents us from calculating the total mutual information which would be equal to @xmath175 .",
    "this is why the method presented here may be useful in estimating correlations .",
    "note that the total entropy @xmath176 , on the other hand , can be computed , as we know the spectrum exactly .",
    "now we will plot the value of the upper bound for the ising model in a transverse field for a range of values of @xmath103 and @xmath44 .",
    "this is exactly what we did in the case of two heisenberg interacting spins .",
    "we will first reproduce the plot of the mean field value of @xmath30 ( which will be a transcendental equation in this case , and hence not analytically solvable ) and then use this value to plot the upper bound on correlations .",
    "the numerical results here will also shows us in which region the approximation can be trusted and where it definitely fails us .",
    "the figure 5 shows the dependence of the mean field magnetization on the external field and the coupling .",
    "one region of failure of the mean field approximation for this model can immediately be seen from the plot .",
    "note that for @xmath161 we have that there are some values of @xmath30 which are higher than one ( in general , we have that @xmath177 ) .",
    "this is the sufficient condition for failure , but not necessary .",
    "there are other regions where the approximation fails - it is only an approximation after all , but they will not concern us at present .",
    "= 7.0 cm +    this figure shows the dependence of our mean field magnetization @xmath30 on the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath44 .    with this in mind , we can now go ahead and plot the upper bound using the results for the magnetization from figure 5 .",
    "the figure 6 contains the plot of the upper bound .",
    "the first thing that strikes us is the existence of two different regions , separated by the boundary where @xmath178 .",
    "this , very interestingly , coincides with the existence of the critical region , @xmath179 , known as the quantum criticality as introduced by sachdev @xcite .",
    "we have already remarked that the quantum criticality is only manifested at zero temperature , and by varying the strength of the external field . in our case , this coincides with the domain when @xmath180 . in our bound , the separation between regions exists , on the other hand , for any values of @xmath103 and @xmath44 .",
    "there is no discontinuity here between the finite temperature region and the @xmath84 region .",
    "it is not clear to the author if this finding has any more general significance for the behaviour of the solid .",
    "note also that there is a non - smooth behavior for the small values of @xmath44 , just where the value of @xmath30 from the mean field theory also fails to be in the region between @xmath181 .",
    "intuitively we expect the approximation to fail here as we are in the region where the external field is dominated by the interaction , and the mean - filed approximation neglects the interaction completely .",
    "= 7.0 cm +    this figure shows the dependence of our correlation bound on the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that the region for which @xmath179 shows an increase in the bound .",
    "this coincides with the notion of the quantum phase transition .",
    "having obtained the above results , how much should we trust our method ?",
    "in other words , what is the domain of validity of the mean field approximation ?",
    "first of all , we can see when the method obviously fails .",
    "this is , as we mentioned above a number of times , when the value of the magnitude ( absolute value ) of @xmath30 becomes greater than @xmath163 .",
    "also , we have failure when the bound on correlations per spin exceeds the maximum value of @xmath163 . we have already commented on when this happens in our model .",
    "there is , however , a more general way of assessing the validity of the approximation .",
    "we will only present a sketch of this argument here , and a much more general analysis can be found in any more advanced statistical mechanics book ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the usual way of deriving the limitations of the mean field approximation is to look at the regime when fluctuations due to interactions become large .",
    "this is when we expect the mean field to fail since the mean field neglect those interactions . how can this regime be determined more precisely ?",
    "we know that the susceptibility is given by the following expressions @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the average magnetization .",
    "we can recast the second equality to obtain : @xmath184 for fluctuations to be small we need to have that @xmath185 more detailed calculations of @xmath186 @xcite suggest that the dimensionality of the system would have to be greater than @xmath187 in order for this to be correct .",
    "this is intuitively pleasing , as higher dimensions imply that each spin has more neighbours and therefore we expect to obtain a better mean field average . in other words , this means that the overall state displays a low degree of correlations . indeed , for the mean field and the exact susceptibility to be approximately equal @xmath188 we have to have that @xmath189 and so we can see that the smaller the mutual information @xmath112 , the better the mean field approximation .",
    "the conclusion of the back of an envelope type of analysis is that we should not expect the one dimensional mean field approximation to be very accurate here .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented in this section indicate to us that there is a general agreement with other results obtained for this model .",
    "generalizations of our method to higher dimensions would certainly be most welcome .",
    "we would now like to discuss another question of very general importance .",
    "so far , we have been careful to point out that our bound has been limiting the amount of total correlations - and thus entanglement , but we have not tried to discriminate between the quantum and the classical contribution to correlations . recently , however , we have seen claims that the effects of entanglement on the macroscopic properties and genuinely different from the effects of classical correlations @xcite .",
    "but , how can we be sure that we have entanglement in a solid and that its effects can not be reproduced by the ordinary , classical correlations ?",
    "we have so far been discussing the effect of correlations as quantified by the mutual information on the macroscopic quantities for some simple ( one dimensional ) spin models .",
    "of course , in a real solid , there is usually a huge number of degrees of freedom to consider and we are here approximating them only with spin half systems .",
    "so , how confident are we that we have really identified effects of entanglement as opposed to some kind of interaction between these huge multitude of neglected degrees of freedom .",
    "can we somehow reproduce the effect of entanglement by allowing more degrees of freedom ?",
    "the answer is  yes \" , and so we have to be very careful under those circumstances if we are to identify something as a clear effect of entanglement .",
    "we will first illustrate this with a very simple example , and will then discuss a more general model , which is extensively used in statistical mechanics , field theory and condensed matter physics .",
    "suppose that we have two correlated qubits .",
    "the maximum value of entanglement is @xmath190 , however the mutual information can be as large as @xmath191 .",
    "our understanding of this difference is that the mutual information represents the total correlations and is therefore the sum of quantum and classical correlations ( whatever they are defined to be - see @xcite for one possible entropic definition ) .",
    "this would suggest that in a maximally entangled state of two qubits we have @xmath171 of classical correlations",
    "( for two qubits we can not have more than this worth of classical correlations ) and @xmath171 worth of entanglement .",
    "so , having two qubits and knowing that @xmath192 immediately implied a maximal unit of entanglement .",
    "however , suppose that these two qubits were really two @xmath187-level systems",
    ". then classical correlations could on their own be as high as @xmath191 . in which case",
    ", the mutual information of @xmath191 would not necessarily imply the existence of any entanglement .",
    "therefore , the actual dimensionality of our constituents is very important .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 dimensional quantum statistical models are isomorphic to @xmath1 dimensional problems in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "let us illustrate this with a very simple example of a quantum mechanical two - level system - a qubit .",
    "the question we would like to ask is : if there is entanglement in the @xmath0 dimensional quantum system how is that reflected in the @xmath1 dimensional classical system ?",
    "let us review how this correspondence works .",
    "suppose we have a quantum system with the hamiltonian @xmath26 - this is a single system and so the dimension @xmath193 .",
    "we will now show how to correspond this to a @xmath194 dimensional classical system .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath195 where @xmath196 is some orthonormal basis .",
    "invoking the completeness relations @xmath197 , this can be written as @xmath198 this is still a quantum mechanical expression and now we will translate it into a  classical hamiltonian \" .",
    "suppose that we require that @xmath199 where @xmath200 are numbers taking values @xmath201 and represent the two values of the spin ( note that it is now more convenient for notational purposes to label the eigenstates as @xmath202 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath203 and @xmath204 can be inferred from this equality . using the right hand side of the equality ( the classical hamiltonian )",
    "we can write the original partition function as @xmath205 where @xmath206 , where , to make the notation closer to the classical ising model , we have used @xmath207 instead of @xmath64 . note that this is now the same as a classical one dimensional ising - like model with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "in fact , this method of equating the quantum evolution in @xmath0 dimension to a classical statistical problem in @xmath1 dimension has been extensively exploited ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a calculational advantage here since it is easier to treat exponentials of numbers ( on the right hand side ) than exponentials of operators ( which are on the left hand side ) , but we are not interested in this motivation here .",
    "suppose that we have a qubit whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath208 where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are just some real numbers .",
    "the solution to the equation ( [ corresp ] ) are given by @xmath211    we are now in the position to address the question at the beginning of this section : if @xmath212 is an entangled state , how is that entanglement reflected in the classical analogue ?",
    "the above treatment is suitable for a single spin system .",
    "when we have two spins , then we need more variables in the classical model .",
    "one way of dealing with this is the following : take a classical chain to represent each of the qubits . to simulate the interaction hamiltonian between the qubits creating entanglement ( correlations in general ) , we need two chains to be interacting .",
    "this is a straightforward application of the above formalism .",
    "therefore , in order to claim that some thermodynamical property is a consequence of two qubit entanglement , we need to make sure that we indeed have two qubits ( and not a classical chain of bits simulating that qubit ) . what happens if we have @xmath88 qubits interacting ?",
    "then we need a two dimensional classical square lattice of interacting spins to simulate this .",
    "a good instance of this is the @xmath31 dimensional classical ising model .",
    "this , in fact , is the reason behind the fact that the one dimensional partition function of a transverse ising model resembles the partition function of onsager for the @xmath31 dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not trivial to show that entanglement is responsible for some macroscopic effects , as by enlarging our system , classical correlations can also sometimes be used to derive the same conclusion .    at the end",
    ", we would like to point out that the above method of making the quantum - classical correspondence is by no means the only one .",
    "another way of representing two interacting qubits is to to make the coefficient @xmath45 spin value dependent .",
    "so we can say that @xmath213 where @xmath214 are the spin - value dependent coefficients .",
    "either way , we see that entanglement in one dimension can always be ( at least in principle ) interpreted as just classical correlations in a higher dimension .",
    "the significance that this quantum - classical correspondence may have for our purposes , if any , is ultimately completely unclear .",
    "what is clear , however , is that we have to be very careful to interpret something as an effect of entanglement unless we are sure that the extra dimensions do not contribute the extra ( purely classical ) correlations .",
    "one way of being sure that entanglement is present is to perform some form of bell inequalities tests , between two spatially separated parts of the solid , thereby ruling out any local classical correlations , but it is not entirely clear how to do this and we leave this issue for future research .",
    "in this paper we have been concerned with deriving an upper bound on the amount of correlations in a solid . our method can be linked to one way of deriving the bogoliubov bound .",
    "we have applied it to two scenarios : two qubits interacting in the heisenberg way , which was just used to illustrate our method , and a chain of qubits interaction in the ising way but being placed in an external transverse field .",
    "we have also discussed several limitations of this method .",
    "although the upper bound presented here can tell us a great deal about total correlations - and therefore do also bound entanglement , in order to gain a better understanding it would be advantageous to find similar lower bounds .",
    "for example , the sum of all bipartite entanglement per qubit is one such bound and it is relatively easy to compute .",
    "in fact , for the ising model in a transverse field ( and at zero temperature ) we have the results we need to compute this @xcite .",
    "it would be important , therefore , to try to derive a tight lower bound on entanglement ( and correlations in general ) , and this we believe to be a very fruitful direction for future research .",
    "another issue is that in general we would have to considered the spin of particles involved @xcite .",
    "this will add the particle statistics consideration into our picture and this , as is well known , can affect the amount of entanglement , as well as being able to convert entanglement for the internal degrees of freedom to the spatial ( external ) degrees of freedom @xcite . although some methods have been developed for quantifying entanglement under those circumstances , this relationship between  internal \" and  external \" entanglement is still not properly understood and the problem would be well beyond the scope of the current investigations .",
