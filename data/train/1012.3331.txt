    "in the protracted debate on the shaping mechanisms of pne ( balick & frank 2002 ) appropriate solutions are sought to explain both the dominant nebula morphology ( e.g. spherical , elliptical , bipolar ; balick 1987 ) and the accompanying collimated outflows or ` jets ' .",
    "single star evolution readily explains spherical pne and potentially elliptical pne if there is interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ; villaver et al .",
    "2003 ; wareing et al .",
    "highly axisymmetric or bipolar nebulae ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) have been modelled with some success including the generalised interacting stellar wind model ( gisw ; kwok , purton & fitzgerald 1978 ; kwok 2000 ) and a combination of stellar rotation and magnetic fields ( e.g. garca - segura 1997 ) .",
    "there are however fundamental limitations in both of these models .",
    "the gisw model depends upon an _ assumed _ density contrast to produce bipolar pne ( e.g. a dusty torus ) and the latter can not operate without an additional supply of angular momentum ( e.g. a binary companion ; soker 2006 ; nordhaus , blackman & frank 2007 ) .",
    "while there are multiple advantages to a binary explanation over existing theories , we are only beginning to understand the prevalence and impact of binarity in pne ( de marco 2009 ; miszalski et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b , 2010 ) .",
    "decisive observational evidence is required to advance the shaping debate which is imbalanced towards theoretical models .",
    "pne with dusty disks seem to support the gisw model though there appears to be a strong dependence on a binary companion for their formation ( chesneau 2010 ) .",
    "similarly , magnetic fields are difficult to observe directly in pne ( jordan et al . 2005 ; sabin et al . 2007 ) , yet they appear to be more influential as part of a binary - driven dynamos ( nordhaus & blackman 2006 ; nordhaus et al .",
    "evidence for close binary central stars of pne ( cspn ) that passed through a common - envelope ( ce ) phase is now firmly established and gaining considerable momentum with at least 40 now known ( miszalski et al . 2009a , 2010 ; de marco et al .",
    "these make up at least @xmath5% of all cspn ( miszalski et al .",
    "2009a ; bond 2000 ) .    with a larger sample of 30 post - ce nebulae miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009b ) found at least 30% , perhaps 6070% , of post - ce binaries had bipolar nebulae suggesting the ce phase preferentially shapes bipolar nebulae .",
    "this is a substantial improvement over the study of bond & livio ( 1990 ) whose sample of around a dozen close binaries showed no clear morphological trends .",
    "high resolution kinematics of nebulae around post - ce cspn have shown a tendency for matched orbital and nebulae inclinations that strengthen the connection between the binary and its nebula ( e.g. mitchell et al .",
    "1997 ; jones et al . 2010 ) .",
    "further progress in this aspect will require a statistically significant sample of post - ce nebulae to be identified and studied in detail to reveal trends bestowed upon the nebula during the ce phase ( miszalski et al .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009b ) made the first steps in this direction by finding a propensity for low - ionisation structures ( gonalves et al .",
    "2001 ) amongst post - ce nebulae either in the orbital plane as a ring ( e.g. sab 41 , miszalski et al .",
    "2009b ; the necklace , corradi et al .",
    "2010 ) and in the polar direction as jets ( e.g. a  63 , mitchell et al . 2007 ) .",
    "jets occur in a wide variety of astrophysical objects including pne in which they are the least understood ( livio 1997 ) .",
    "the connection between jets and binarity has long been suspected ( soker & livio 1994 ) but never proven given the paucity of known pne with jets _ and _ binary cspn .",
    "jets in pne typically have low outflow velocities ( @xmath6100 km / s ) , but higher velocities of 200300 km / s are not uncommon , e.g. m 1 - 16 ( schwarz 1992 ; corradi & schwarz 1993 ) , ngc 6337 ( corradi et al .",
    "2000 ) and ngc 2392 ( gieseking , becker & solf 1985 ) , and can even reach 630 km / s in the case of mycn 18 ( oconnor et al . 2000 ) .",
    "there is no strong evidence for highly collimated outflows ( e.g. herbig - haro - like outflows ) in genuine pne and frew & parker ( 2010 ) suggest the few objects with the most collimated outflows are instead related to b[e ] stars .",
    "the most striking example is hen 2 - 90 ( sahai & nyman 2000 ) which was later reclassified as a b[e ] star ( kraus et al .",
    "2005 ; frew & parker 2010 ) .    instead , jets in pne manifest as point - symmetric ` corkscrew'-like outflows ( lpez et al .",
    "1993 ; vzquez et al .",
    "2008 ) or as pairs of opposing knots often called fast low - ionisation emitting regions ( fliers ; see e.g. balick et al . 1987 , 1993 ; dopita 1997 ) with notable examples being hb 4 ( lpez et al .",
    "1997 ; harrington & borkowski 2000 ; miszalski et al .",
    "2009b ) , ngc 6337 ( corradi et al .",
    "2000 ; garca - daz et al . 2009 ) , a  63 ( mitchell et al .",
    "2007 ) , ic 4634 ( guerrero et al . 2008 ) , ic 4673 ( kovacevic et al .",
    "2010 ) , sab 41 ( miszalski et al .",
    "2009b ) and the necklace ( corradi et al .",
    "further examples are listed by gonalves et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and harrington & borkowski ( 2000 ) .",
    "point - symmetric jets have received the most attention in the literature with models consisting of an episodic precessing jet powered by an accretion disk in a wide binary with @xmath7@xmath6a few years ( e.g. raga , cant & biro 1993 ; cliffe et al .",
    "1995 ; haro - corzo et al .",
    "2009 ; raga et al .",
    "precession helps smear out or widen the jet and may also explain the often ` bent ' position of jets with respect to the presumed major axis ( e.g. hb 4 and sab 41 ) .",
    "some jets appear in two pairs ( e.g. ngc 6337 ) and these may have arose from multiple ejections ( e.g. nordhaus & blackman 2006 ) .",
    "a similar scenario involves a _ short - lived _ ` wobbling ' accretion disk ( livio & pringle 1996 , 1997 ; icke 2003 ) and models with magnetic fields have also successfully been applied to the problem ( garca - segura 1997 ) .",
    "dynamical lifetimes of jets suggest they are ejected well before the main nebula ( mitchell et al . 2007 ; corradi et al .",
    "2010 ) , i.e. before the ce is ejected if a close binary is present , and this is consistent with the short - lived nature of the modelled accretion disks .    the most constructive way to establish the link between jets and binaries is to look for binary cspn in a large sample of pne with jets .",
    "this is one of the major aims behind our ongoing program to look for close binary cspn via the photometric monitoring technique ( miszalski et al .",
    "we are also targeting bipolar pne and through non - detections we will also be able to discern whether larger orbital periods produce point - symmetric jets rather than fliers .",
    "the program has been very successful so far with at least five close binary cspn found using the 1.2-m flemish mercator telescope .",
    "these include the necklace and its supernova 1987a - like ring ( corradi et al .",
    "2010 ) , the type ia supernova candidate double - degenerate nucleus of hen 2 - 428 ( santander - garca et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the subject of this paper , ethos  1 .",

    "beyond the confines of galactic plane h@xmath8 surveys ( parker et al . 2005 ; drew et al .",
    "2005 ) there are very few pne currently known as less than 9% of @xmath62800 galactic pne are located at latitudes @xmath9 .",
    "most of these were found from visual inspection of photographic broadband sky survey plates ( e.g. kohoutek 1963 ; abell 1966 ; longmore 1977 ; weinberger 1977 ; longmore & tritton 1980 ; hartl & tritton 1985 ) . with the digitisation of the same material it is now possible to extend this work to lower surface brightnesses and to systematically search larger areas more efficiently ( jacoby et al .",
    "the mash - ii project ( miszalski et al . 2008 ) demonstrated that visual searches for pne are largely insensitive to compact or star - like pne .",
    "several compact pne were found from catalogue queries of the supercosmos h@xmath8 survey ( parker et al . 2005 ) including the mash - ii pn mpa  1327 - 6031 that lies just near the outer lobe of the bipolar mash pn phr  1327 - 6032 ( parker et al .",
    "2006 ) . the number of distant ( compact ) halo pne is therefore essentially unknown .",
    "further discoveries are essential to determine whether halo pne can only be formed via close binary evolution ( bond 2000 ) as there is currently only a small amount of supporting evidence ( e.g. pea & ruiz 1998 ; tovmassian et al .",

    "an irradiated close binary central star was discovered with an orbital period of 0.535 days and an amplitude of 0.816 mag .",
    "the extreme amplitude is second only to sab 41 ( miszalski et al .",
    "2009a ) and is consistent with the presence of a very hot central star that produces the highly ionised nebula ( @xmath18 k ) .",
    "the necklace ( corradi et al . 2010 ) and k 1 - 2 ( exter et al . 2003 ) also share similarly large amplitudes and high - ionisation nebulae , although the absence of low - ionisation filaments in ethos  1 may suggest a slightly different evolutionary history .",
    "vlt fors spectroscopy of the cspn confirms the presence of a close binary with a large velocity separation between primary and secondary components and the nebula .",
    "the presence of n iii , c iii and c iv emission lines continues the trend seen in other irradiated close binary cspn .",
    "these weak emission lines are typical of many cspn classified as",
    "_ wels _ in the literature and we expect many of these will turn out to be close binaries .",
    "further observations are required to constrain the orbital inclination , masses and radii of the binary cspn .    a spectacular pair of jets travelling at @xmath1 km / s accompanies the inner nebula of ethos  1 adding further evidence towards the long suspected relationship between binary cspn and jets .",
    "their tips present emission line ratios that are consistent with shocked models of fliers in pne .",
    "the fact that the jets are detached suggests a limited period of jet activity consistent with a transient accretion disk before the ce is ejected .",
    "the kinematic age of the jets ( @xmath3 yrs / kpc ) was found to be older than the inner nebula ( @xmath4 yrs / kpc ) supporting this hypothesis .",
    "ethos  1 therefore continues to follow this trend previously identified in a  63 ( mitchell et al .",
    "2007 ) and the necklace ( corradi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "both ethos  1 and the necklace have younger kinematic ages than a  63 consistent with the apparent ongoing cooling in the younger jets via [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "a close binary engine powering jets is out of place in the literature with most models of jets incorporating orbital periods of several years ( cliffe et al .",
    "1995 ; haro - corzo et al . 2009 ; raga et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these models may be adequate if the accretion disk is established before the companion begins its in - spiral phase as our kinematic ages suggest .",
    "nevertheless , new models with shorter orbital periods may be necessary to model the jets in objects like ethos  1 which are relatively more collimated than extant model jets .",
    "vlt fors imaging and mes high - resolution spectroscopy of the inner nebula of ethos  1 was conducted .",
    "the @xmath2-shaped inner nebula was reconstructed using a shape kinematic model consisting of bipolar outflows and a spherical nebula .",
    "the faint bipolar extensions particularly visible in the [ o  iii ] fors image could be an earlier ejection occurring at about the same time as the jets or alternatively may represent a bubble produced by the jets clearing out a cavity around the pn .",
    "similar bipolar outflows are seen in a 65 ( walsh & walton 1996 ) , ppa 1759@xmath262834 ( miszalski et al . 2009b ) and fg 1 ( boffin & miszalski in prep . ) suggesting they may have a binary - related origin .",
    "it may also be possible that ethos  1 represents a slightly more evolved state of hb 12 ( vaytet et al .",
    "2009 ) where the spherical nebula is ejected on top of a pre - existing hb 12 system .",

    "<S> we report on the discovery of ethos  1 ( pn g068.1@xmath011.0 ) , the first spectroscopically confirmed planetary nebula ( pn ) from a survey of the supercosmos science archive for high - latitude pne . </S>",
    "<S> ethos  1 stands out as one of the few pne to have both polar outflows ( jets ) travelling at @xmath1 km / s and a close binary central star . </S>",
    "<S> the lightcurve observed with the mercator telescope reveals an orbital period of 0.535 days and an extremely large amplitude ( 0.816 mag ) due to irradiation of the companion by a very hot pre - white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> ethos  1 further strengthens the long suspected link between binary central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) and jets . </S>",
    "<S> int ids and vlt fors spectroscopy of the cspn reveals weak n iii , c iii and c iv emission lines seen in other close binary cspn and suggests many cspn with these weak emission lines are misclassified close binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we present vlt fors imaging and manchester echelle spectrometer long slit observations from which a kinematic model of the nebula is built . an unusual combination of bipolar outflows and a spherical nebula conspire to produce an @xmath2-shaped appearance . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic age of the jets ( @xmath3 yrs / kpc ) are found to be older than the inner nebula ( @xmath4 yrs / kpc ) consistent with previous studies of similar pne . </S>",
    "<S> emission line ratios of the jets are found to be consistent with reverse - shock models for fast low - ionisation emitting regions ( fliers ) in pne . </S>",
    "<S> further large - scale surveys for close binary cspn will be required to securely establish whether fliers are launched by close binaries .    </S>",
