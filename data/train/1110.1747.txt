    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has proven to be a robust theoretical model that very accurately describes the properties of elementary particles observed in nature and the forces of interaction between them . in this model , the electromagnetic and weak forces",
    "are unified into a single electroweak theory .",
    "the measured masses of the particles that mediate the electroweak force , however , are vastly different  the photon has zero mass while the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons have masses almost 100 times heavier than the mass of a proton .",
    "to explain this difference , the theory predicts the existence of a higgs field which interacts with the elecroweak field via electroweak symmetry breaking to produce masses for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons while leaving the photon massless .",
    "interaction with the higgs field would also explain how other fundamental particles acquire mass .",
    "an additional spin-0 particle , the higgs boson , is also predicted to arise from the higgs field .",
    "this particle is the only sm particle that has not been observed in nature and evidence of this boson would be a direct test of the theory .",
    "the higgs mechanism is predicted to give mass to other particles , yet the mass of the higgs boson itself is a free parameter of the theory that must be determined experimentally .",
    "direct searches at the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) at cern and indirect electroweak measurements result in a preferred sm higgs boson mass @xmath3 between 114.4 and 185  gev / c@xmath4  at 95% confidence level ( c.l ) . in this region ,",
    "the range 156  @xmath5  177  gev / c@xmath4  has additionally been excluded at 95% c.l . by direct searches at the fermilab tevatron @xmath6  collider  @xcite and the range above @xmath7  146 ( 145 )",

    "the higgs boson would be produced most often through gluon fusion ( @xmath9 ) , followed by associated production with either a @xmath1 or @xmath2 vector boson ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and vector boson fusion ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "figure  [ production ] shows diagrams of these processes and table  [ tab : sigma ] gives the predicted sm cross sections for higgs boson masses between 100 and 150  gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "the sm higgs boson search strategy at the tevatron is driven by the most dominant decay modes . at lower mass ( @xmath13  135  gev / c@xmath4 ) , @xmath14  @xmath15  provides the greatest sensitivity to higgs boson observation despite the exclusion of the gluon fusion process for this channel due to large multijet backgrounds . for @xmath7  135  gev / c@xmath4",
    ", @xmath16 provides the greatest sensitivity .",
    "further sensitivity to a sm higgs observation at the tevatron is obtained by the inclusion of more challenging channels such as @xmath17 .",
    "the sm branching fraction for a higgs boson decaying to a photon pair b(@xmath18 )  is very small , reaching a maximal value of about 0.2% at @xmath3  =  120  gev / c@xmath4  ( see table  [ tab : sigma ] ) .",
    "the greatest sensitivity for this channel , however , is obtained for 110  @xmath5  140  gev / c@xmath4 , in the preferred region from electroweak constraints and in a region where combined tevatron higgs boson searches are least sensitive  @xcite .",
    "the diphoton final state is also appealing due to its cleaner signature compared to @xmath19 jets .",
    "the better reconstruction efficiency for photons provides a larger relative acceptance of @xmath18  events and the photon s better energy resolution leads to a narrow mass peak for the higgs boson , which is a powerful discriminant against smoothly falling diphoton backgrounds .",
    "these experimental signatures help make the diphoton final state one of the most promising search modes for higgs boson masses below 140  gev / c@xmath4  at atlas and cms experiments at the lhc , which have recently presented first results in this channel  @xcite .",
    "in addition to sm @xmath18  production , one can devise many possible beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios where b(@xmath18 )  is enhanced . )  can be found in reference  @xcite . ]",
    "any resonance observed could also then be evidence for a bsm higgs . in the sm , the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism requires a single doublet of a complex scalar field .",
    "however , it is likely that nature does not follow this minimal version and that a multi - higgs sector may be required . here",
    ", we also consider a model which requires a doublet higgs field for which the symmetry breaking mechanism responsible for giving higgs masses to gauge bosons is separate from that which generates the fermion masses . in the benchmark model",
    "considered , a `` fermiophobic '' higgs boson ( @xmath20 ) is predicted that assumes sm couplings to bosons and vanishing couplings to all fermions .",
    "the gluon fusion process is then suppressed and only vh and vbf processes remain , which results in a reduction in the production cross section by a factor of four .",
    "this reduction is compensated , however , by the branching fraction for this model , which can be larger than that predicted by the sm scenario by more than two orders of magnitude for low higgs boson masses ( see table  [ tab : sigma ] ) .",
    "the higher branching fraction causes a larger number of predicted fermiophobic higgs boson events compared to the sm higgs boson .",
    "direct searches at lep set a lower limit on the fermiophobic higgs boson mass of 109.7  gev / c@xmath4  with 95% c.l .    here , we present a search for both a sm and fermiophobic higgs boson in the diphoton final state from @xmath6  collisions at @xmath21  1.96  tev from the fermilab tevatron collider",

    "the dominant backgrounds to prompt photons originating from the event vertex are electrons faking photons and jets faking photons .",
    "the latter is more frequent and typically occurs when a jet fragments into a @xmath22 or @xmath23 meson which then decays to multiple photons .",
    "these delayed photons are collinear and are often mis - reconstructed as a single photon . in order to identify high - energy prompt photons and reduce these backgrounds ,",
    "both the d0 and cdf analyses start by searching for photon candidates with the following signature : ( i ) the majority of the energy should be deposited in the em calorimeter rather than the hadronic calorimeter , ( ii ) the em cluster should be isolated in the calorimeter , ( iii ) there should be no high - momentum tracks originating from the primary event vertex that are associated with the em cluster , and ( iv ) the em shower profile is consistent with that of a prompt photon .",

    "the difference in azimuthal angle of the two photons @xmath34 is also required to be greater than 0.5 , which keeps 99% of the higgs boson signal but reduces prompt qcd photons originating from fragmentation , a process not well modeled in the simulation .    for a higgs boson signal decaying to two photons , data with the above selection",
    "is composed of both an irreducible and a reducible background .",
    "the irreducible background is from two sm qcd photons from the hard interaction where the shape for different kinematic variables is modeled from sherpa mc and the normalization of this background is obtained from a fit made to the final discriminant distribution when setting limits on higgs boson production .",
    "the reducible background is composed of fake events where at least one photon candidate is misidentified as a prompt photon .",
    "both the shape and normalization of kinematic distributions for drell - yan @xmath35 events are obtained from pythia mc prediction . the shape for @xmath36jet and jet+jet background distributions",

    "a 4-component vector is constructed @xmath39 where the value of one element is 1 and other elements are 0 based on whether one or both photon candidates pass a stronger requirement of @xmath40 . the weight @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) then represents events where both photon candidates pass ( fail ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) represents events where only the leading ( subleading ) photon candidate in the event and subleading refers to the second highest . ] photon candidate passes .",
    "the efficiency of this cut for the photon and jet samples ( @xmath27 and @xmath31 ) are parametrized as a function of @xmath23 and used to construct a 4@xmath384 efficiency matrix @xmath45 .",
    "a system of linear equations @xmath46 is then solved on an event - by - event basis in order to obtain a weight for events with two true photons @xmath47 , a weight for events with two jets faking a photon @xmath48 , and a weight for events where only the leading ( subleading ) candidate is a true photon @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "then , for example , the number of dijet events is taken as the sum of the dijet weights obtained for each data event : @xmath51 similarly , the @xmath52jet background is determined from the sum of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 components .",
    "the resulting background composition is then determined for each higgs boson mass hypothesis ( @xmath53  gev ) where the approximate percentage of @xmath54 events is 53% , of @xmath55 events is 44% , and of drell - yan events is 3% .",

    "the most recent searches for a higgs boson in the diphoton final state exploit the narrow @xmath3 resolution to discriminate between the signal and background . with a good understanding of the background modeling for different kinematic distributions , however ,",
    "further sensitivity is gained at d0 by using these variables with a multivariate technique .",
    "in addition to the diphoton mass @xmath33 , four other variables with kinematic differences between the signal and background are also considered for this analysis : the transverse momentum of the diphoton system @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the transverse momentum of the leading and subleading photon , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "these five well - modeled kinematic variables are used to construct a single discriminant from a boosted decision tree ( bdt ) algorithm , trained to distinguish a higgs boson signal from the backgrounds .",
    "this process is repeated for each higgs mass hypothesis for 100  @xmath5  150  gev / c@xmath4  in 2.5  gev / c@xmath4  steps , and is trained separately for a sm and fermiophobic higgs boson signal . as an example , the @xmath33 and @xmath56 distributions ( @xmath60  115  gev / c@xmath4 ) for the data , background , and expected sm and fermiophobic higgs boson signal are shown in fig .",

    "photon efficiencies for both central and plug photons are validated using z  @xmath64 decays in both data and mc .",
    "@xmath18 signal acceptance is further increased by reconstructing events in which a single central photon converts into an electron - positron pair , which is found to occur approximately 15% of the time for @xmath63 .",

    "the tracks from both electrons are required to point to a fiducial electromagnetic energy cluster .",
    "photons of a higher @xmath32 range are selected by requiring the secondary electron to have @xmath25  1.0  gev / c and the reconstructed conversion photon to have @xmath25  15  gev / c . in order to reject jet backgrounds , only a small fraction of hadronic @xmath69 associated with the primary electron s cluster",
    "is allowed .",
    "additionally , requirements are made on the conversion candidate s calorimeter isolation which is obtained from the primary electron s isolation energy  @xcite with the secondary electron s @xmath32 subtracted if its track points to a different calorimeter phi tower .",
    "the shape describing the ratio of transverse energy to transverse momentum ( @xmath70 ) is peaked at one for isolated photon conversions , but has a long tail for photon conversions from @xmath22 or @xmath23 @xmath71 decays due to the extra energy from the unconverted photon .",

    "the conversion @xmath69 is obtained from the primary electron s @xmath69 with the secondary electron s @xmath32 added if it is in a different calorimeter tower while the photon s reconstructed transverse momentum is obtained by adding the vector sum of the two track s momenta at the radius of the conversion .",
    "a final requirement removes events with a small radius of conversion , primarily to reduce prompt electron - positron pairs from dalitz decays of neutral pions @xmath72 .",
    "the direction of the conversion photon s momentum is obtained by taking the vector sum of the individual track momenta ; however , better @xmath18  mass resolution is obtained by setting the total momentum to be the conversion s energy obtained from em calorimeters , which additionally constrains the photon s mass to zero .",
    "reconstruction of photon conversions in the cdf analysis provides an improvement of about 13% in sensitivity to a higgs boson signal .",
    "data events in the cdf analysis are divided into four independent subsamples according the position and type of the photon candidate . in cc events ( the most sensitive category ) , there are two photons in the central region of the detector . in cp events ,",
