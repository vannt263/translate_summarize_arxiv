    "the development of meta materials has led to renewed interest in the original work by veselago on negative refraction  @xcite and the field of meta materials is in rapid growth . for more details",

    "is governed by  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative dielectric permittivity , @xmath1 is the relative magnetic permeability , @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath8 is the angular frequency with @xmath9 being the free - space wave vector . for nature s",

    "however , for artificial composite dielectric structures in the meta material limit , where the free - space wavelength @xmath12 is much longer than the characteristic length scale ( periodicity ) @xmath13 of the underlying ( quasi ) periodic structure , one may for the slowly varying homogenized fields ( envelopes ) have an effective permeability @xmath14 which is constant in space and which at certain frequencies deviates remarkably from the microscopic permeability , i.e. @xmath15 and in particular it may become negative . the same apparent paradox is also possible for the dielectric response . as an example fig .",

    "photonic crystal structures , the band structure and the photonic band - gap formation can be understood in terms of mie resonances  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the band structure reveals a strong hybridization at the frequency corresponding to the first mie resonance of the rods as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "it is this resonance behaviour which make the rods behave as artificial magnetic atoms with the possibility for a negative-@xmath1 response .    in this work",
    "we extract the effective permeability by applying the recently derived mesoscopic homogenization theory for p - polarized fields by felbacq and bouchitt  @xcite .",
    "we in detail study the effective permeability @xmath14 and the effect of the topology of the rods as well as the influence of spatial disorder / randomness and dispersion in the rod topology , compare panels ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for rods with a more arbitrary cross section",

    "fig1](b ) .",
    "it is easily verified that a circular cross section of radius @xmath24 gives @xmath25 .",
    "more generally , the topological radius @xmath0 captures the qualitative resonance behaviour of the effective permeability as we shall see in the following .",
    "our results for more arbitrary topologies rely on approximative results for the spectral problem of the helmholtz equation as employed recently by one of us in the context of diffusion dynamics , fluid flow , and ion transport in microfluidic problems  @xcite .",
    "we consider the problem of p - polarized fields corresponding to a magnetic field aligned parallel to the rods , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . in the limit where @xmath26",
    "the problem posed by maxwell s equations can be treated by a multi - scale expansion approach leading to an effective magnetic permeability given by  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the area of @xmath19 , @xmath29 is the air - filling fraction , and @xmath30 is governed by    [ eq : mueff ] @xmath31    above , we have used the dirac _ bra - ket _ notation and inner products are defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are functions on @xmath19 .",

    "@xcite we solve the problem in a complete basis defined by the helmholtz eigenvalue equation    @xmath39    with the basis functions being orthonormal , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , the ansatz @xmath41 fulfills the boundary condition and the expansion coefficients are readily determined by standard _ bra - ket _ manipulations . in this way we arrive at the following general expression for the effective permeability  @xcite @xmath42 the strength of this result is obviously the connection of @xmath14 to the spectrum and eigenstates of the helmholtz equation which have been studied in great detail in various contexts of physics , including membrane dynamics , the acoustics of drums , the single - particle eigenstates of 2d quantum dots , not to forget quantized conductance of quantum wires .",
    "finally , the results of course in turn provides the direct link between @xmath14 and the mie resonances .",
    "in the following we utilize approximate results for the spectral problem and its dependence on geometry .",
    "we start by introducing the effective area @xmath43 so that eq .  (",
    "[ eq : muexpansion ] ) is rewritten as @xmath44 where we in the second line have truncated the rapidly converging sum making the approximation valid in the vicinity of the main resonance .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we have listed the first eigenvalue @xmath45 and the corresponding effective area @xmath46 for a number of different geometries . for the numerical results we have employed a finite - element method with an adaptive mesh algorithm ( comsol multiphysics ) ensuring fast convergence of both eigenvalues and eigenstates . inspecting the column for the eigenvalue @xmath47 in table  [ tab1 ] we note that the numbers do not in general change much from geometry to geometry , despite the variation in topology .",
    "the small spread originates in the normalization by the topological radius @xmath0 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rtop ] ) . for the effective area",
    "@xmath46 we likewise observe a modest variation .",
    "it is worthwhile emphasizing the results for a circular cross section which become good approximations for also other relatively compact topologies . in the following we thus use the approximation that @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the first zero of the bessel function , i.e. @xmath51 . with these approximations",
    "we finally arrive at @xmath52 where all the dependence on geometry is captured by the topological radius @xmath0 .",
    "we may now estimate the resonance wavelength .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 , then for weakly absorbing materials , @xmath53 , we have the resonance around @xmath54 with a line width of the order @xmath55 as expected the line width reflects the damping due to @xmath56 in the high - index material .",
    "furthermore , we may also estimate the magnitude of the effective magnetic response .",
    "just below the resonance the real part is bounded by @xmath57 while for the imaginary part @xmath58 the above results illustrate how @xmath6 , @xmath29 , and @xmath0 influence the magnetic response .",
    "obviously , a negative permeability requires that @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "some absorption is of course needed to have a finite line width instead of a delta - function - like response which would suffer tremendously from the inevitable effects of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "we shall return to this in sec .",

    "the validity of the assumptions underlying eq .",
    "( [ eq : mumultiscale ] ) has been tested in refs .",
    "@xcite by comparing simulated transmission spectra of the real photonic crystal to spectra based on the corresponding homogenized meta material . in this work",

    "( [ eq : mueffapprox ] ) .",
    "we do this by comparing the outcome of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mueffapprox ] ) to numerical solutions of the original problem posed by eq .",

    "we use a finite - element method with an adaptive mesh algorithm ( comsol multiphysics ) for this purpose . for the dielectric function",
    "we use @xmath60 as in ref .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the corresponding photonic band structure .",
    "clearly , there is a strong hybridization at the frequency corresponding to the isolated mie resonance of the rod , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda_resonance ] ) .",
    "it is this avoided crossing which causes strong resonance in the effective permeability that is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the approximate result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mueffapprox ] ) works excellently near the main resonance for rods with circular cross section as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] while the approximation of course does nt capture high - order modes due to the truncation of the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muexpansion_truncation ] ) . in the following",
    "we go a step further and test the result for highly non - circular geometries .",
    "[ fig4 ] illustrates results for one such example .",
    "as seen there is a good qualitative agreement and since the geometry is highly non - circular , see inset , the quantitative agreement is perhaps better than expected .",
    "note how the change in topological radius @xmath0 scales the resonance wavelength @xmath61 and the line width @xmath62 compared to the circular case , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda_resonance ] ) while the conservation of the air - filling fraction @xmath29 leads to the same magnitude of the response in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : remu ] ) and ( [ eq : immu ] ) which depend only on @xmath29 , but not on @xmath0 .",
    "the present results suggest that shape plays only a minor role and mainly affects the particular value of the resonance frequency ( which is proportional to the topological radius @xmath0 ) while the air - filling fraction @xmath29 and the dielectric function @xmath3 tend to govern the magnitude of the effective magnetic response .",
    "this suggests that homogenized materials will not be strongly influenced by spatial disorder / randomness conserving the average air - filling fraction while shape dispersion ( dispersion in the topological radius , possibly also influencing the average air - filling fraction ) will give rise to a smearing of the resonance phenomena .",
    "suppose that for a particular topological radius @xmath63 the resonance wavelength is @xmath64 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda_resonance ] ) , and that the width of the resonance is @xmath65 . assuming a gaussian distribution of @xmath0 , @xmath66,\\ ] ] and neglecting the dependence of the intrinsic line width @xmath65 on @xmath0 we get an inhomogeneous suppression of the resonance magnitude by a factor @xmath67 , @xmath68 and an inhomogeneous broadening of the resonance by a factor @xmath69 , @xmath70 thus , inhomogeneous broadening will be negligible if @xmath71 corresponding to @xmath72 fig .  [ fig5 ] illustrates these results in the case of rods of circular cross section as in fig .",
    "the results are obtained from a numerical evaluation of @xmath73 with @xmath14 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mueffapprox ] ) . as also suggest by eq .",
    "( [ eq : criterion ] ) a size dispersion with a relative variation comparable to @xmath74 preserves the negative-@xmath1 phenomena while larger variations will result in a positive @xmath14 .",
    "we have studied the magnetic response of rod - type dielectric meta materials within the recently developed homogenization theory @xcite and we have in particular investigated the effects of topology and inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "we predict that topology itself mainly affects the mie resonance frequency while the resonance shape mainly depends on the air - filling fraction and the ratio @xmath75 with @xmath3 being the relative dielectric function of the rods .",
    "furthermore , we argue that randomness / disorder conserving the air - filling fraction will have a limited influence on the negative-@xmath1 phenomena while dispersion in the topological radius @xmath0 of the rods may lead to significant inhomogeneous broadening and suppression of the phenomena .",
