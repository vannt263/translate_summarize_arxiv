    "regge theory provides a useful tool for phenomenological description of high energy hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "the quantitative predictions of regge calculus are essentially dependent on the assumed coupling of participating hadrons to pomeron . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we described elastic @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) scattering including the recent lhc data in terms of simple regge exchange approach in the framework of additive quark model ( aqm )  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend our description to the processes of single and double diffractive dissociation .    in aqm baryon",
    "is treated as a system of three spatially separated compact objects ",
    "constituent quarks .",
    "each constituent quark is colored , has internal quark - gluon structure and finite radius that is much less than the radius of proton , @xmath2 .",
    "this picture is in good agreement both with @xmath3 symmetry of strong interaction and the quark - gluon structure of proton  @xcite .",
    "the constituent quarks play the roles of incident particles in terms of which @xmath0 scattering is described in aqm .    to make the main ingredients and notations of our approach more clear we start from the elastic scattering in the section  2 .",
    "the formalism used to describe single and double diffractive dissociation is presented in the section  3 while the obtained numerical results are compared with the experimental data in the section  4 .",
    "elastic amplitudes for the large energy @xmath4 and small momentum transfer @xmath5 are dominated by the pomeron exchange .",
    "we neglect the small difference in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering coming from the exchange of negative signature reggeons , odderon ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath6-reggeon etc , since their contribution is suppressed by @xmath7 .    the single @xmath5-channel exchange results into amplitude of constituent quarks scattering @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pomeron trajectory specified by the intercept , @xmath10 , and slope , @xmath11 , values .",
    "the pomeron signature factor , @xmath12 determines the complex structure of the amplitude .",
    "the factor @xmath13 has the meaning of the pomeron coupling to the beam and target particles , the functions @xmath14 being the vertices of constituent quark - pomeron interaction ( filled circles in fig .  [ 1p2p ] ) .    due to factorization of longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom the longitudinal momenta",
    "are integrated over separately in high energy limit .",
    "after this the transverse part of the quark distribution is actually relevant only .",
    "it is described by the wavefunction @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the quark transverse momenta , normalized as @xmath17 and a shorthand notation is used @xmath18    the elastic @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 , here we do not distinguish between them ) scattering amplitude is basically expressed in terms of the wavefunction as @xmath19 in this formula @xmath20 , is the initial proton wavefunction @xmath21 is the wavefunction of the scattered proton , and the interaction vertex @xmath22 stands for the multipomeron exchange , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the momenta transferred to the target quark @xmath25 or beam quark @xmath26 by the pomerons attached to them , @xmath27 is the total momentum transferred in the scattering , @xmath28 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is presented in aqm as a sum over the terms with a given number of pomerons , @xmath29 where the amplitudes @xmath30 collect all diagrams comprising various connections of the beam and target quark lines with @xmath31 pomerons .",
    "similar to glauber theory @xcite one has to rule out the multiple interactions between the same quark pair .",
    "aqm permits the pomeron to connect any two quark lines only once .",
