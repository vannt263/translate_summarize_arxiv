    "this is because one needs to take care that the functions involved remain on the correct riemann sheet , and because one has to control potentially large numerical cancellations .",
    "no similar general solution was available so far at two  loop level in the general massive case , although a lot of effort was devoted to solving two  loop massive integrals at finite external momenta .",
    "there are two issues involved , given a general diagram with particles with spins : first , the numerator of the amplitude usually has non - trivial tensorial structures .",
    "it is convenient for us to decompose the amplitude into various tensorial constructs made of external momenta and metric tensors , multiplied by scalar functions , which in turn must be related back to the original feynman integral by certain projections .",

    "was done in this direction lately , and it has become clear that in general the integrals involved at two  loop level are not expressible analytically in terms of well  known and easy to evaluate functions like polylogarithms , as is the case with one  loop diagrams .",

    "strictly speaking , our formulae can be used directly for calculating one given diagram only if that diagram is free of mass singularities . however , in actual calculations this can be often circumvented by isolating the singularity analytically at the level of the integrand , by considering infrared finite sums of diagrams , or by introducing a mass regulator , as was possible for instance in ref .",

    "@xcite , whose authors used separate methods for individual diagrams to perform the same calculation , and which is so far the state  of  the  art of physical calculations by using these methods .    within the framework which we propose",
    ", we shall show that in any renormalizable theory all two  loop diagrams can be expressed in terms of a few scalar functions . to our best knowledge",
    ", these functions can not be expressed analytically in terms of known functions , in a way which would facilitate their numerical evaluation .",
    "there should be in principle a connection with generalized hypergeometric functions , but it s not clear that this would lead to an efficient evaluation of these functions . instead of looking for an analytical result",

    "this work makes use of some special properties ( dimensional shifts ) , due to schwinger representation of propagators and was able to express any two - loop _ propagator _ diagrams by a minimal set of four master integrals .",
    "it is further asserteded that this result does not depend on the renormalizability of the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "our assertion is that _ any two - loop n - point diagram _ can be expressed by four basic functions , as long as the theory is renormalizable .",
    "we have not specifically looked into propagator diagrams to see if there are extra symmetries or recurrence relations such that this result still holds for nonrenormalizable theories .",
    "furthermore , we were not primarily interested in identifying a minimal set of basic functions , but rather in obtaining a framework which leads to expressions convenient to evaluate numerically .",
    "thus , our remark that there is no finite set of basis integrals for non - renormalizable theories should be taken only as a most direct inference from our work so far .",
    "in this section we show that the calculation of two  loop feynman diagrams with any tensor structure at the numerator can be reduced to the evaluation of a class of scalar invariants .    any two  loop diagram without numerators",
