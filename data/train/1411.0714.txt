    "a tmd factorization [ , ] generalizes the usual concept of parton density by allowing pdfs to depend on intrinsic transverse momenta in addition to the usual longitudinal momentum fraction variable .",
    "these transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions ( also called unintegrated parton distributions ) are widely used in the analysis of semi - inclusive processes like drell - yan process or single - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) or dijet production in hadron - hadron collisions ( for a review , see ref .
