    "an atom initially trapped in the stationary standing wave dipole trap ( laser beam frequency difference @xmath35 ) can be moved along the optical axis by changing @xmath36 which causes the potential wells to move at the velocity @xmath37 . to control the frequency difference",

    "they can be decelerated and brought to a stop at a predetermined position along the standing wave @xcite .",
    "without additional cooling , the lifetime of atoms in a dipole trap is ultimately limited by heating . a fundamental source of heating in dipole traps is spontaneous scattering of trap laser photons . due to",
    "the large detuning of the trapping laser the photon scattering rate at the maximum trapping laser intensity is @xmath39 is only 14  s@xmath34 .",

    "the above scattering rate yields a recoil heating rate of about @xmath43k / s which is negligible in our experiment .",

    "the smaller focus leads to a much higher radial oscillation frequency ( @xmath55 ) . from the very strong dependency ( [ eq : point ] ) of the heating rate on the oscillation frequency @xmath44",
    "we infer that the pointing instabilities in radial direction are negligible in our current , less strongly focused dipole trap .",

    "[ fig : lifetime ] . however , in our experiments there is an additional technical noise due to fluctuations of the relative phase @xmath56 between both aom drivers .",
    "this phase noise is directly translated by the aoms into position fluctuations @xmath57 of the dipole potential along the standing - wave axis @xmath58 . the rms phase noise amplitude @xmath59  rad has directly been measured by heterodyning both output signals of the aom drivers .",
    "when this noise is evenly distributed over 1  mhz bandwidth and @xmath60  khz , equation  ( [ eq : point ] ) yields a heating rate of 4  mk / s . at higher oscillation",
    "amplitudes the harmonic trap approximation presumed in equation  ( [ eq : point ] ) breaks down and the oscillation frequency goes to zero which slows down the heating process .",
