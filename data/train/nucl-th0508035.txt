    "advances in the understanding of the single - particle ( sp ) properties of nucleons in nuclei and nuclear matter  @xcite demonstrate the dominant influence of short - range and tensor correlations in generating the distribution of the spectral strength .",
    "one aspect of this influence is expressed in the global depletion of fermi sea due to these correlations . a recent experiment from nikhef puts this depletion of the proton fermi sea in @xmath3pb at a little less than 20%  @xcite in accordance with earlier nuclear matter calculations  @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the presence of short - range and tensor correlations is the appearance of high - momentum components in the ground state to compensate for the depleted strength of the mean field .",
    "recent jlab experiments  @xcite indicate that the amount and location of this strength is consistent with earlier predictions for finite nuclei  @xcite and calculations for infinite matter  @xcite . of particular relevance",
    "is the observed energy distribution of the sp strength of the high - momentum nucleons that is located at energies far removed from the fermi energy .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of nuclear matter  @xcite and also holds above the fermi energy .",
    "such sp strength distributions lead to substantial modifications of the calculated properties of low - energy phenomena , like pairing , as compared to those generated by a traditional mean - field treatment .",
    "pairing properties of nuclear and neutron matter have been studied for quite some time .",
    "a recent review can be found in ref .",
    "the study of pairing correlations in infinite quantum systems is an interesting question in general relating nuclear and neutron matter to the classical systems studied in condensed matter physics as well as to the studies of pairing correlations in fermionic atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "the study of pairing correlations in nuclear and neutron matter is of particular interest for the understanding of properties of neutron stars .",
    "the formation of a bcs gap has a significant effect on the neutrino emissivity , which is crucial for the cooling of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the existence of superfluid layers will affect the rotation of neutron stars .    of particular interest",
    "is the observation that several calculations for the bare nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupled channel lead to a sizable gap of around 10 mev at normal nuclear matter density  @xcite .",
    "those calculations typically solve the bcs gap equation using a mean - field sp propagator with sp energies as determined _ e.g. _ in a brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) calculation .",
    "the empirical data of finite nuclei do not exhibit any indications for such strong proton - neutron pairing correlations , which would correspond to a gap as large as 10 mev .",
    "therefore one may conclude that such evaluations of a pairing gap in infinite matter yield quite different results from those observed for finite nuclei .",
    "this appears plausible since pairing effects are very sensitive to the sp spectrum close to the fermi energy , which is continuous in infinite matter while it is discrete in finite nuclei .",
    "this observation may also cast some doubt on the reliability of the approach to determine the pairing gap for infinite matter as outlined above .",
    "therefore attempts have been made to go beyond this mean - field approach .",
    "one issue discussed in the literature has been the role of vertex corrections , _",
    "i.e. _ the medium dependence of the nn interaction to be used in solving the gap equation  @xcite . using effective interactions like the gogny force  @xcite shen",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite observe indeed a significant effect , which is larger for nuclear matter than for neutron matter .",
    "the effects of the so - called induced interaction could indeed affect the low - energy spectroscopy of nuclear matter in a significant way .",
    "before conclusions can be drawn , calculations employing realistic interactions should be performed , which , unfortunately , are very difficult  @xcite . in addition , it is possible that polarization effects are different in nuclear matter and finite nuclei on account of the difference of the sp spectra discussed above .    in the present work we would like to focus the attention to the study of pairing correlations with a proper treatment of the nucleon propagator that accounts for the effects of short - range and tensor correlations .",
    "the crucial effects of short - range and tensor correlations on the distribution of the sp strength have recently been treated at a very sophisticated level .",
    "various groups have developed techniques to evaluate the sp strength from realistic nn interactions , like the argonne v18  @xcite or the cdbonn  @xcite interaction , within the self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) approach  @xcite .",
    "such calculations reproduce the energy- and momentum - distribution of the sp strength corresponding to high - momentum nucleons as observed in experiments  @xcite and account for the depletion of the mean - field strength obtained in  @xcite .    in these calculations",
    "the scattering equations for two nucleons in the medium are solved employing dressed sp propagators that contain the complete information about the energy- and momentum - distribution of the sp strength .",
    "the resulting scattering matrix @xmath4 is then used to calculate the nucleon self - energy .",
    "the solution of the dyson equation , employing this complex and energy dependent self - energy , yields the sp propagator that enters the @xmath4 matrix equation to close the self - consistency cycle . in determining the two - nucleon green s function or the corresponding scattering matrix @xmath4",
    ", one has to face the problem of the so - called pairing instabilities that reflect the existence of nn bound state solutions in the scattering equation .",
    "the presence of such solutions provides a major numerical obstacle for a self - consistent evaluation of one- and two - body propagator within the normal green s function approach at densities where such instabilities can occur . for this reason",
    ", recent scgf calculations have been performed for temperatures above the critical temperature for a possible phase transition to pairing condensation  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii of this work we will review some basic features of the scgf method for the normal green s function at temperatures above the critical one for the pairing instability .",
    "the effects of the anomalous green s functions will be considered in sec >  iii .",
    "this leads to the generalized gap equation that corresponds to the homogeneous scattering equation for dressed nucleons .",
    "the analogous problem occurs for two nucleons in the vacuum , where the solution of the homogeneous scattering equation yields the description of the bound two - nucleon state , the deuteron . in the nuclear medium , however , one has to consider a scattering equation with dressed sp propagators .",
    "if one considers the hf or bhf approximation for the normal sp propagator , in which the spectral function is replaced by a @xmath5-function , this gap equation reduces to the usual bcs approximation .",
    "results of scgf calculations above the critical temperature will be discussed in sec .",
    "we will pay special attention to the spectral functions associated with sp strength around the fermi energy and discuss , to which extend these exhibit typical precursor phenomena for a phase transition to a pairing condensate  @xcite . in sect .  iv we will also investigate how the distribution of the sp strength modifies the solution of the gap equation and the subsequent predictions for a phase transition to a superfluid state of nuclear matter .",
    "such investigations have been performed before by bozek  @xcite using simplified models for the nn interaction .",
    "these studies suggest an important sensitivity to these correlations , accompanied by a substantial suppression of the strength of pairing .",

    "the inclusion of dressing effects in the study of pairing has also been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the hole - line expansion of the nucleon self - energy . while also in this work a substantial reduction of the strength of pairing is observed , the implementation of the scheme to solve the gap equation relies on approximations that do not conserve particle number , since they involve the introduction of quasiparticle strength factors to represent the effect of dressing .",
    "final conclusions are drawn in sec .",

    "the one - particle green s function obeys the following quasi - periodicity condition @xmath12 for a system invariant under translation in space and time , the propagator depends only on the differences @xmath13 and @xmath14 , allowing a fourier transformation into momentum and energy variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the pole in the bose function @xmath35 at @xmath36 is compensated by a corresponding zero in the @xmath4 matrix  @xcite such that the integrand remains finite as long as the @xmath4 matrix does not acquire a pole at this energy .",
    "such a pole may occur below a critical temperature @xmath37 , a phenomenon that is often referred to as a pairing instability .",
    "we will come back to this problem below .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath4 is to be determined as a solution of the integral equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 stands for the two - particle green s function of two non - interacting but dressed nucleons .",
    "the green s function method yields a hierarchy of relations for the @xmath40-particle green s functions .",
    "the dyson equation for the one - particle green s function involves the two - body potential as well as the two - particle green s function @xmath41 . in general , the equation of motion for the @xmath40-particle propagator will be coupled to the @xmath42-particle propagator , if the hamiltonian contains a two - body interaction . in the self - consistent @xmath4-matrix approach , as outlined above , one ignores the effects of @xmath40-particle green s functions with @xmath40 larger equal to three , but solves the coupled equations for the one- and two - body green s functions in a self - consistent way .",
    "in order to allow for an efficient solution of the two - body scattering equation , one expresses the two - particle green s function in ( [ two_pp ] ) as a function of the total momentum @xmath43 and the relative momentum @xmath44 . using the usual angle - average approximation for the angle between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for the accuracy of this approximation ) , the two - particle green s function can be written as a function of the length of these two - vectors , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , only .",
    "this approximation leads to a decoupling of partial waves with different total angular momentum @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the integral equation ( [ eq : tscat0 ] ) reduces to an integral equation in only one dimension of the form @xmath50 the summation of the partial waves , @xmath51 yields the @xmath4 matrix in the form that is needed in eq .",

    "while the self - consistent inclusion of ladder diagrams has reached quite a sophistication , it remains to fully account for the possibility of a pairing solution in such calculations for realistic nn interactions . in this paper",
    "we present a first step towards such a complete scheme by including the full self - consistent dressing due to normal self - energy terms generated by ladder diagrams , in the calculation of the anomalous self - energy and the solution of the corresponding generalized gap equation .",

    "the purpose of this figure is to visualize some differences between various models of the nn interaction and between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter .",
    "therefore we consider a larger interval for the energy variable @xmath16 .",
    "the imaginary parts of the self - energy derived from the cdbonn interaction and the argonne v18 ( arv18 ) interaction  @xcite are very similar at energies around @xmath78 . at those energies",
    "the arv18 yields a slightly weaker imaginary part than cdbonn .",

    "the minimum for the cdbonn interaction is only about -35 mev and occurs at energies @xmath16 around 0.5 gev .",

    "figure  [ fig : compself ] also displays results for the real and imaginary part of the self - energy for neutrons with the same momentum ( @xmath15 = 225 mev ) in pure neutron matter .",
    "the density of neutron matter considered in this figure is one half of the empirical saturation density of nuclear matter , which implies that these systems have the same fermi momentum .",

    "is obtained around 1.7 gev . at these high energies",
    "the absolute value for the imaginary part of the self - energy is about a factor three larger for arv18 than for cdbonn .",
    "this means that the distribution of sp strength to high energies due to central short - range correlations is much stronger for the local arv18 interaction than for the non - local meson - exchange model cdbonn .",

    "the differences in the amount of nn correlations is also reflected in the occupation probability @xmath54 defined in ( [ occupation ] ) . for symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density",

    "( [ def : zk1 ] ) we define @xmath109 which means that we determine @xmath110 _ e.g. _ from the ratio of the results displayed by the solid and the dashed - dotted line in fig .",

    "results for such a strength factor are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : zfact ] .",
    "typical values for @xmath111 are around 0.8 to 0.9 and show only a weak dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "this demonstrates that the effects of correlations may be expressed in terms of a renormalization factor @xmath112 to be used in the usual bcs equation .",
    "such renormalization effects have been discussed by boek  @xcite and baldo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . note , however , that the renormalization factor @xmath111 is defined by eq .  ( [ def : zk2 ] ) and the complete distribution of sp strength is required to calculate it .",
    "it will be interesting to examine , to which extend this factor can be approximated by simpler estimates for the strength located in the quasi - particle peak .    for that purpose we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : zfact ] also results from simple estimates of this strength distribution .",
    "if one assumes that the imaginary part of the self - energy is a constant , not depending on the energy variable @xmath16 , one can estimate this renormalization factor by @xmath113 note , however , that the real - part of the self - energy @xmath114 calculated in scgf yields negative slopes as a function of energy for various momenta and energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compself ] ) .",
    "therefore the values for @xmath115 yield values larger than 1 over a wide range of momenta , which is very different from the corresponding values for @xmath111 .",
    "one may try to improve the estimate for the strength factor by accounting for an energy dependence of the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath116 .",
    "this leads to  @xcite @xmath117 this improvement also does not lead to results that are consistent with @xmath111 ( see fig .",

    "this means that we expect results for the generalized gap - equation ( [ eq : gappw ] ) which are similar to those obtained in refs .",

    ", the value of the gap parameter at @xmath70 is even larger ( @xmath100 = 10.6 mev ) and the gap calculated within the usual bcs approach disappears only at a temperature of 5.9 mev .",
    "this increase of the pairing gap with decreasing density can be related to the momentum - dependence of the pairing gap @xmath119 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap3s2 ] : the gap function increases with decreasing momentum .",
    "therefore , as the fermi momentum decreases with density , the value @xmath100 tends to decrease with density . at even lower densities , however , this effect is more than compensated by the feature , that the phase - space of two - hole configurations decreases with density , so that ultimately the gap parameter will approach the binding energy of the deuteron in the limit of @xmath120 .",

    "the momentum considered for this figure , @xmath15 = 193 mev / c , is slightly below the fermi momentum @xmath82 = 208 mev / c .",

    "the pairing correlations modify the spectral distribution into the direction which is obtained in the simple bcs approximation for @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : specbcs ] ) . also note , that these modifications of the spectral function @xmath67 as compared to @xmath20 is limited to a small interval of energies around @xmath78 and to momenta close to the fermi momentum .",
    "finally , we consider the case of neutron - neutron pairing in pure neutron matter .",
    "we will focus the attention to densities , where the pairing correlations in the @xmath98 partial wave are dominating .",
    "results for the gap parameter @xmath121 as a function of temperature are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapneutr ] . using the bcs approximation with sp energies derived from the quasi - particle energies of scgf calculations we obtain a gap at @xmath70 , which , for the range of densities considered , increases with decreasing density .",
    "this is in agreement with results of similar calculations , which are summarized _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .     in neutron matter as a function of temperature @xmath4 .",
    "results are presented for the usual bcs approximation ( dashed lines ) and the solution of the generalized gap equation ( ) in the @xmath98 partial wave using the cdbonn interaction .",
    "[ fig : gapneutr],width=264 ]    the effects of short - range correlations are weaker in neutron matter than in nuclear matter .",
    "this has been discussed already above in connection with the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : compself ] .",
    "this can also be seen in a comparison of the dressed two - particle propagator and the effective strength factor @xmath110 defined in eq .",
    "( [ def : zk2 ] ) . while a calculation of @xmath110 for symmetric nuclear matter at @xmath73 = 0.16 @xmath74 yields values for @xmath110 , which are typically around 0.8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zfact ] ) , corresponding values for @xmath110 in neutron matter at @xmath73 = 0.08 @xmath74 are around 0.9 .",
    "nevertheless , also these weaker effects of short - range correlations in neutron matter are sufficient to suppress the formation of a pairing gap in neutron matter at @xmath73 = 0.08 @xmath74 .",
    "such a suppression of pairing correlations is also observed at smaller densities . in this case , however , the inclusion of the correlation effects just leads to a reduction of the gap parameter at a given temperature and a reduction of the critical temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gapneutr ] ) . extrapolating our results to neutron matter with higher densities",
    ", we expect that the short - range correlations will suppress the formation of pairing in the @xmath122 partial waves at those densities  @xcite .",
    "an attempt has been made to treat the effects of short - range and pairing correlations in a consistent way within the @xmath4-matrix approach of the self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) method .",
    "the pairing effects are determined from a generalized gap equation that employs sp propagators fully dressed by short - range and tensor correlations .",
    "this equation is directly linked to the homogeneous solution of the @xmath4-matrix equation of nn scattering in the medium , which is one of the basic equations of the scgf approach at temperatures above the critical temperature for a phase transition to pairing condensation .",
    "while short - range and tensor correlations yield a redistribution of sp strength over a wide range of energies , the effects of pairing correlations on the spectral function are limited in nuclear matter to a relatively small interval in energy and momentum around the fermi surface .",
    "the formation of a pairing gap is very sensitive to the quasi - particle energies and strength distribution at the fermi surface and can be suppressed by moderate temperatures .",
    "the formation of short - range correlations are sensitive to a larger range of energies and momenta .",
    "so we observe , that the non - local cdbonn interaction is softer with respect to the formation of short - range correlations but yields larger pairing gaps compared to the local arv18 model for the nn interaction .    from this sensitivity to different areas in momentum and energy",
    "one may conclude that the features of short - range correlations should be rather similar in studies of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "the investigation of pairing phenomena , however , is rather sensitive _ e.g. _ to the energy spectrum around the fermi energy .",
    "therefore the shell effects of finite nuclei may lead to quite different results for pairing properties than corresponding studies in infinite matter .",
    "the redistribution of sp strength due to the short - range correlations has a significant effect on the formation of a pairing gap .",
    "while the usual bcs approach predicts a gap for proton - neutron pairing in nuclear matter at saturation density as large as 8 mev , the inclusion of short - range correlations suppresses this gap completely .",
    "correlation effects are weaker at smaller densities , but still lead to a significant quenching of the proton - neutron pairing gap and to a reduction of the critical temperature for the phase transition . compared to symmetric",
    "nuclear matter correlation effects are weaker in neutron matter .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusion of correlations suppresses the formation of a gap for neutron - neutron pairing at @xmath73 = 0.08 @xmath74 completely and yields a significant quenching at lower densities .",
    "the effects of dressed sp propagator in the generalized gap equation could be described in terms of an effective strength factor @xmath123 , which has been considered in the literature before  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to derive the value of this strength factor from bulk properties of the self - energy .",
    "although the effects of pairing correlations on the sp green s function is weak and limited to a small range in energy and momentum , these modifications are very important to extend scgf calculations to densities and temperatures that suffer from the so - called pairing instability .",
