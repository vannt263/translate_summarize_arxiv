    "characterizing the properties of galaxy population at high redshift is one of the most important goals of modern cosmological study , as star - forming galaxies are the primary candidate for the sources of ionizing photons that reionized the universe . in recent observational ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they both suggest that the faint - end slope of uv luminosity function ( uv lf ) is quite steep , and that the ionizing photon budget is dominated by the low - mass , star - forming galaxies below the current detection limit .",
    "in particular , some cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have found extremely steep faint - end slopes of @xmath13 , which could be the result of too efficient star formation ( sf ) in their subgrid sf model at high-@xmath14 .",
    "previous sf models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relied on the statistical representation of locally observed @xcite relationship , which is dependent on the total gas column density .",
    "recent observations @xcite suggest however that sf correlates strongly with molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "as the @xmath0 gas is less abundant at higher redshifts due to lower metallicities , the previous sf models that rely only on total gas density may be overproducing stars @xcite , potentially affecting the number density of low - mass galaxies at high-@xmath14 .    in this work ,",

    "since the estimation of @xmath0 mass fraction is dependent upon metallicity , the details regarding our feedback and enrichment models are relevant .",
    "when sf takes place , metals are also produced with an instantaneous yield of @xmath42 , and thereafter tracked by the code based on a closed box model for each gas particle ( i.e. , no diffusion ) .",

    "our implementation of the @xmath0-sf model of @xcite must be similar to the previous work by @xcite on the most basic level .",
    "the primary difference between the two work is in the class of code in which it was implemented , enzo ( amr ) versus gadget ( sph ) .",
    "we will further discuss the basic differences and potential effects in sections  [ sec : lf ] and [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we combine the results of our three runs to create a composite lf , which covers a much wider dynamic range than is possible with a single cosmological run . in figure",
    "[ fig : lfsch ] , we present our composite lf for @xmath52 ( red triangles , blue circles , green squares ) for the @xmath0 run , in comparison to the @xcite fits for our fiducial runs ( dashed red , blue , green lines ; * ? ? ?",

    "we also show the observed lf fit range ( gray shade ; * ? ? ?",
    "a small , constant extinction @xmath53 is required to fall within the observational range for both runs @xcite , although the @xmath0 runs at @xmath54 & 8 require less extinction by @xmath55 than the fiducial runs , suggesting a trend of decreasing @xmath53 with increasing redshift .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is chosen to be consistent with the value used to match the observed rest - frame uv lf in our previous work @xcite , and it is centered between the following two recent observations : @xcite argued for little to no extinction at the faint end of the lf at @xmath10 , whereas @xcite found a best - fit value of @xmath57 , which corresponds to @xmath58 assuming @xmath59 @xcite at the bright end of the uv lf at @xmath10 .",
    "this moderate amount of extinction is also consistent with the estimates by @xcite and @xcite who included nebular emission lines in their spectral energy distribution fits",
    ". therefore the values of @xmath56 chosen for this work are reasonably consistent with current observations .    at @xmath60 ,",
    "both fiducial and @xmath0 runs show excellent agreement with each other and observations .",
    "however at @xmath61 , the @xmath0 run start to show a turn - over of the lf , which is not present in the fiducial lfs .",
    "this flattening significantly reduces the number density of low luminosity objects in the @xmath0 run , and it occurs beyond current observational limit of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . as this population of low - luminosity galaxies is thought to be the critical contributor to the total ionizing flux at these redshifts @xcite , it is important to quantify this reduction and its implications .    to quantify the turnover point and flattening , we adopt a modified schechter function ( hereafter schechter+ ) : @xmath62^{-1 } , \\label{schplus}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the normalization , characteristic luminosity , and faint - end slope of the standard schechter function .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath66 indicates the point at which the lf undergoes its second turn , and @xmath5 is related to the power - law slope at the lowest luminosities .",
    "note that @xmath67 when @xmath68 , and that both @xmath65 and @xmath5 take negative values .",
    "a similar functional form to equation  ( [ schplus ] ) was used by @xcite to characterize the upturn in dwarf galaxy population at low redshift .    using the magnitude version of equation  ( [ schplus ] ) ,",
    "we perform a least - square fit to the @xmath0 runs by fixing the three standard schechter parameters ( @xmath69 ) to those obtained for the fiducial runs by @xcite , and vary the remaining two parameters ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the best - fit results can be seen as solid red , blue and green lines in figure  [ fig : lfsch ] and are quantified in table  [ tbl : sch ] .    in the rightmost @xmath8 panel , we have overplotted the fits to @xmath10 & 7 results to demonstrate the evolution .",
    "one can clearly see that the number of galaxies increases from @xmath8 to @xmath10 as the dark matter structure develops and more sf takes place .",
    "one might note the somewhat large uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are fixing the standard schechter parameters ( @xmath71 ) to our fiducial results and only fitting the new schechter+ parameters ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this was done in order to make a valid comparison between the current results and our previous results @xcite .",
    "if we make a full five parameter fit , we noticed that the value of @xmath73 becomes unphysically brighter and @xmath65 becomes quite steeper , due to the chosen schechter+ functional form . as a result ,",
    "the size of the error bar of @xmath5 becomes smaller , however there would be no meaningful physical comparison to be made between the three parameter schechter values which was obtained in our previous work .",
    "therefore we chose to fix the standard schechter parameters as in our previous work , despite of large error bar on @xmath5 .",
    "ccccc + @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77&@xmath78 + @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82&@xmath83 + @xmath84 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87&@xmath88 [ tbl : sch ]    in the leftmost @xmath10 panel , we have over plotted the enzo amr simulation from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* black open squares , corrected for dust extinction by the same amount as our simulation ) , which also used the same @xcite @xmath0-sf model . at the brighter side of @xmath89 ,",
    "we see good agreement between the two simulations .",
    "however , on the fainter side of @xmath61 , the enzo result drops sharply relative to our sph results .",
    "while the origin of this difference is not entirely clear , one possible explanation is that the amr simulation is missing the early structure formation of low - mass dark matter halos relative to our sph simulations @xcite .",
    "the simulation of @xcite used a comoving box size of 12.5 mpc , which is not very different from our n400l10 run .",
    "however , their root grid is only 256@xmath90 , which effectively corresponds to 128@xmath90 particles of sph/@xmath91-body simulation @xcite .",
    "although their highest spatial resolution after recursive refinement might be higher than our simulation , their amr simulation would miss a large number of low - mass halos at early times due to lack of force resolution at early times , hence significantly lower number of dwarf galaxies compared to our sph simulations which used @xmath92 dark matter particles .",
    "this is a well - known issue of amr cosmological simulation , and has been extensively discussed by @xcite .",
    "if @xcite wanted to resolve the low - mass halos down to the same halo mass as our n400l10 run , they had to start their simulation with @xmath93 root grid and correspondingly low dark matter particle mass . in their figure  1 , @xcite show that their halo mass function starts to deviate from @xcite at @xmath94 , whereas our halo mass function in n400l10 run agrees very well with @xcite down to @xmath95 , as we showed in figure  17 of @xcite .",
    "this corroborates our suspicion that the main difference in the two results is coming from the difference in the number of low - mass halos in the two simulations .",
    "we also discuss the other possibility of difference in metal diffusion in section  [ sec : disc ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : params ] , we summarize the redshift evolution of best - fit schechter+ parameters . we see that @xmath6 becomes dimmer and the power - law slope @xmath96 of @xmath97 becomes shallower with decreasing redshift .",
    "these results support the current paradigm of hierarchical structure formation : as the smaller objects form first and later merge to form larger systems , the number of dim object decreases , and the lf becomes flatter at the faintest end . since the predicted @xmath6 occurs at @xmath98 at @xmath54 & 8 , this feature should be observable by future missions such as _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) .     & 8 , shown with 1@xmath99 error bars .",
    "the sfrf @xmath5 value is offset by @xmath100 for readability .",
    "the horizontal dash - dotted line in the top panel represents the approximate _ jwst _ observable limit ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "]      a recent work by @xcite presented the observed sfrf from dust - corrected uv lf by converting @xmath102 into sfr using the @xcite conversion .",
    "the sfrd is then easily obtained by integrating the schechter - like fit to the sfrf down to a certain lower limit , culminating in the commonly used lilly - madau diagram @xcite .",
    "comparing the sfrf of our simulated galaxies to the observed results is an excellent test of our sf model , since sfr is one of the most basic outputs of our simulations .",
    "it is also a more intrinsic comparison for us as it does not require any assumptions on our part regarding the amount of extinction in our simulated galaxies as this correction is included in the observational estimates .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrf ] shows the sfrf of simulated galaxies at @xmath52 ( red triangles , blue circles and green squares , respectively ) .",
    "we find good agreement with the observed results ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cyan diamonds ) , especially at @xmath54 .",
    "deviation at low - sfr end of @xmath10 is expected , given a similar deviation in the lf at the low - end shown in @xcite .",
    "this deviation could either indicate that our simulation is still overproducing stars at @xmath10 , or it could also be due to uncertainties in the faint - end observations ( i.e. , missed faint galaxies ) and/or assumptions regarding extinction .",
    "the sfrf has a similar functional form as the lf , therefore we utilize the same schechter+ function to fit it : @xmath103 , and @xmath104^{-1 } , \\label{eq : sch_sfrf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , sfr@xmath105 and @xmath65 are the usual schechter parameters as in equation  ( [ schplus ] ) ; sfr@xmath106 is the location of the second turnover , and @xmath5 is related to the low - sfr end power - law slope which is proportional to ( @xmath107 ) at @xmath108 .",
    "the best - fit results to all five parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : sfrf ] with solid lines . similarly to the rest - frame uv lf , the right - most panel shows the increase in normalization and brightening of sfr@xmath106 clearly from @xmath8 to @xmath10 .",

    "the mass of @xmath114 also represents the minimum galaxy resolution of the n400l10 run ( @xmath117100 star particles ) .",
    "the solid observational data points were obtained assuming the salpeter imf , therefore we also show the same data points corrected for the chabrier imf with open symbols by applying a simple factor ( see section 3.2.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "our conclusions are not affected by the change in the imf .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrd ] demonstrates that , when integrated down to a minimum sfr ( @xmath118 ) , the @xmath0 run agrees very well with the fiducial run and observational estimates .",
    "this is expected , since the @xmath0-sf model did not affect the number density of objects within the observed range of @xmath60 ( figure  [ fig : lfsch ] ) .",
    "we note that the observed points were calculated by integrating the uv lf to a limiting @xmath119 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath120 when converted via @xcite relation .",
    "the green crossed line , representing the integration limit of @xmath121 , shows that the total sfrd in our simulations is significantly higher than what is currently observed .",
    "this is consistent with our previous findings @xcite .",
    "the reduction of sfrd at @xmath1 is also consistent with findings by @xcite , and @xcite , who show that @xmath0-sf model reduces high-@xmath14 sfrd due to metallicity effect @xcite .",
    "however the degree of reduction may still be different among different simulations and models .    to determine whether or not our simulated galaxy population is sufficient to maintain reionization",
    ", we utilize the theoretical prescription presented in @xcite , which quantifies the minimum sfrd required to keep the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ionized ( shaded gray contour ) : @xmath122.\\ ] ] this depends on redshift and the ratio of igm clumping factor ( @xmath123 ) and escape fraction ( @xmath124 ) of ionizing photons from galaxies .",
    "given that the exact values of both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are still debated and uncertain , we show a wide range of @xmath111 ( grey shade in figure  [ fig : sfrd ] ) which are consistent with works by @xcite .",
    "we also include an updated estimation of the critical sfrd by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blue dot - dashed line ) which includes considerations for the ly - continuum production rates and the temperature scaling of the recombination rate coefficient .",
    "their calculation uses a fiducial value of @xmath125 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrd ] reinforces our previous arguments @xcite that the abundant , low - luminosity galaxies , which are currently beyond the detection threshold of _ hst _ , dominate the total sfrd at @xmath1 .",
    "when this population is considered , there is sufficient amount of ionizing photons available to maintain ionization by @xmath126 for a reasonable value of @xmath127 .",
    "using gadget-3 cosmological sph simulations equipped with a @xmath0-sf model , we examined uv lf , sfrf and the contribution of low - luminosity galaxies to the total sfrd at @xmath1 .",
    "our major conclusions are as follows .    * we find that , at @xmath128 , the @xmath0-based sf model does not change the faint - end slope from our fiducial runs with @xmath129 at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however at the fainter end of @xmath61 , we find a significant reduction in number density of faint galaxies due to the metallicity effect of @xmath0-sf model @xcite . * to characterize the new lf s turnover magnitude ( @xmath6 ) and subsequent slope ( @xmath5 ) , we utilize the schechter+ function ( equation  [ schplus ] ) , and",
    "find that @xmath6 evolves with redshift from @xmath130 ( @xmath10 ) to @xmath131 ( @xmath8 ) , while the second power - law slope ( @xmath132 ) becomes steeper over the same redshift range with @xmath11 ( figure  [ fig : params ] ) . *",
    "we present the sfrf of simulated galaxies ( figure  [ fig : sfrf ] ) , and find good agreement with observations .",
    "we also find similar evolution in the schechter+ parameters of sfrf : as @xmath133 becomes slightly lower with increasing redshift , and the second power - law ( @xmath132 ) becomes steeper over the same redshift with @xmath134 ( figure  [ fig : params ] ) .",
    "* although the @xmath0-sf model reduces the number density of low - luminosity galaxies , there is still sufficient sfrd ( i.e. , ionizing photons ) to maintain reionization at @xmath135 ( figure  [ fig : sfrd ] ) for a wide parameter range of clumping factor ( @xmath123 ) and escape fraction ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "when examining the results of numerical simulations , the resolution effect is always a concern .",
    "the n400l10 run used in the present work is reaching the densities similar to that of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , but it is not resolving the formation and internal structure of gmcs adequately .",
    "the model of @xcite is meant to capture the general behavior of gmcs on average , and @xcite have shown that the @xmath0-sf model has a number of advantages over the previous sf models .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed by @xcite , the @xmath0-sf model has some inherent resolution dependency .",
    "although we believe that the observed turnover in the uv lf and sfrf are physical in nature , the exact values of @xmath4 and @xmath133 may vary with resolution .",
    "another concern is the impact of uvb on the faint - end slope of lf .",
    "earlier work using semi - analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the uvb suppresses the formation of low - mass galaxies via photoionization of gas in shallow potential wells .",
    "in particular , @xcite have shown that the gas fraction drops rapidly from cosmic fraction ( @xmath136 ) at @xmath137@xmath117@xmath138 to almost zero at @xmath137@xmath117@xmath95 .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the turnover seen in our lf and sfrf could be the result of photoevaporation of gas from low - mass halos and not a feature of the implemented @xmath0-sf model . in order to verify that the turnover at @xmath6 and @xmath139 in the @xmath0 runs are not affected by the uvb",
    ", we ran two test simulations with and without uvb . as a result",
    ", we found that the turn - over still exists even in the no - uvb run , and only the normalization of uv lf decreased slightly due to photoionization .",
    "the overall shape of the lf and sfrf remained unchanged , i.e. , the values of @xmath6 and @xmath139 did not change significantly . therefore , while the uvb reduces the number of low - mass galaxies in our simulations , we confirmed that the turn - over at @xmath6 and sfr@xmath106 is due to the @xmath0-sf model .",
    "in section  [ sec : lf ] we discussed the differences between the results of enzo amr simulation and our gadget sph simulations .",
    "another fundamental difference between the two codes is in metal mixing , which could have an effect on these results . in our sph code metals",
    "are locked to the individual sph particles , thus limiting mixing and diffusion of metals .",
    "in contrast grid - based codes follow the fluid element in cells , which may allow for more natural mixing and diffusion within and between the cells .",
    "conversely in low resolution regions , this could lead to over - smoothing of metals . at the moment",
    ", it is unclear how much impact the metal mixing and diffusion would have on the results presented in this paper , unless we perform more rigorous comparison tests between the two codes .",
    "we intend to investigate the issue of metal mixing and diffusion in the future using both sph and amr codes .",
