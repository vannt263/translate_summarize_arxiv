    "di - electrons serve as direct probes of dense nuclear matter stages during the course of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the superposition of various sources , however , requires a deconvolution of the spectra by means of models . of essential interest",
    "are the contributions of the light vector mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the spectral functions of both mesons are expected to be modified in a strongly interacting environment in accordance with chiral dynamics , qcd sum rules etc .  @xcite .",
    "after the first pioneering experiments with the dls spectrometer @xcite now improved measurements with hades @xcite start to explore systematically the baryon - dense region accessible in fixed - target heavy - ion experiments at beam energies in the few agev region .",
    "we apply here our brobuu transport model to the di - electron data measured by hades in the reaction c(2 agev ) + c. some features of the code are described in section 2 , while section 3 is devoted to the presentation of simulation results and the comparison to data .",
    "the brobuu computer code for heavy - ion collisions developed by a budapest - rossendorf cooperation solves the boltzmann - hling - uhlenbeck equation in the quasi - particle @xmath2 for the one - body distribution function @xmath3 of a certain hadron species .",
    "this equation is applied to the motion of different hadron species , each with rest mass @xmath4 , in a momentum and density dependent mean field @xmath5 . the scalar mean field @xmath5",
    "is chosen in such away that the hamiltonian @xmath6 equals @xmath7 with a usually in a non - relativistic manner calculated potential @xmath8 @xmath9 where the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 define special types of potentials , while @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the baryon number density , saturation density and nucleon distribution function .",
    "the brobuu code propagates in the baryon sector the nucleons and 24 @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances and additionally @xmath20 and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "details will be reported elsewhere .",
    "different particles species ( each described by a corresponding distribution @xmath21 ) are coupled by the collision integral @xmath22 which also contains the hling - uhlenbeck terms responsible for pauli blocking in the collision as well as particle creation and annihilation processes .",
    "the set of coupled boltzmann - hling - uhlenbeck equations is solved by using the parallel - ensemble test - particle method , where each distribution function is represented by @xmath23 .",
    "this method transforms the partial differential ",
    "integro equations into a set of ordinary differential equations ( looking like equations of motion ) for a large number of test particles simulating the ensemble averaging process for the respective function @xmath21 .",
    "recently theoretical progress has been made in describing the in - medium properties of particles starting from the kadanoff - baym equations @xcite for the green functions of the particles . in the medium particles",
    "have a finite life time which is described by the width @xmath24 in the spectral function @xmath25 of the particles .",
    "the spectral function being the imaginary part of the retarded propagator in the kadanoff - baym equations , @xmath26 , is essentially defined by the self - energies @xmath27 of the particle in the medium . for bosons",
    "it reads @xmath28 where im@xmath29 and re@xmath30 depend on @xmath31 and the local medium properties .",
    "the spectral function can significantly change during the heavy - ion collision process and can be simulated by an ensemble of test particles with different masses .",
    "the change of the spectral function is now given by time variation of the test particle mass @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "for bosons this additional equation reads @xmath33 where the values of the selfenergy @xmath30 are taken at the positions of the test particles @xmath34 , and @xmath35 stands for the comoving time derivation .",
    "the real part of the selfenergy is related to the mean field @xmath5 .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) is actually a corollary of three equations describing the propagation of energy , three - momentum and position of a test particle .",
    "this equation ensures that resonances are propagated towards their vacuum spectral functions at freeze - out @xcite .",
    "this technique , allowing for a consistent propagation of broad resonances , is applied in the brobuu code for calculating the di - electron emission of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons .    besides the propagation of broad resonances the spectral function also controls the production of mesons .",
    "vector mesons ( @xmath36 ) are essentially created by the decays of baryon resonances ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the mass distribution reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the triangular function .",
    "the resonances @xmath37 is created in nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath40 and meson - nucleon collisions , @xmath41 . @xmath37",
    "may more generically decay as @xmath42 into other channels ( @xmath43=@xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) .",
    "resonance parameters for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are fitted to available data for meson production in nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon reactions @xcite .    in our calculations",
    "we employ a simple form of the selfenergy : @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ areal ] ) describes schematically a mass shift proportional to the density @xmath15 of the surrounding matter related to the normal matter density @xmath16 .",
    "the effect of the collision broadening is given in eq .",
    "( [ aimag ] ) which depends on density , relative velocity @xmath51 and the cross section @xmath52 of the vector meson in matter .",
    "this cross section is calculated via the breit - wigner formula @xmath53 for forming resonances with masses @xmath54 , angular momenta @xmath55 , partial widths @xmath56 , total widths @xmath57 with energy @xmath58 and relative momentum @xmath59 in the entrance channel . in vacuum the baryon density @xmath15 vanishes and the resulting spectral function@xmath60 is solely determined by the energy dependent width @xmath61 .",
    "the di - electron production from vector meson decays @xmath62 is calculated by integrating the local decay probabilities along their paths in the collision .",
    "the subleading so - called direct channel @xmath63 is treated with the cross section @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 mev , @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 mev .",
    "analog considerations apply to the channel @xmath69 .",
    "we also include into our simulations a bremsstrahlung contribution which is guided by a one - boson exchange model adjusted to @xmath70 virtual bremsstrahlung and transferred to @xmath71 virtual bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "actually we use @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is again the @xmath76 invariant mass , @xmath77 denotes the two - particle phase space volume , @xmath58 stands for the c.m.s.energy in a nucleon - nucleon collision , @xmath78 is the reduced energy squared after the dilepton emission , and @xmath79 is the corresponding total cross section .",
    "we employ the above described code for the reaction c(2 agev ) + c , where first data from hades @xcite are at our disposal . in the present explorative study we are going to contrast simulations with and without medium modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons to elucidate to which degree medium effects can become visible in the light collision system under consideration . in doing",
    "so we use fairly schematic medium effects condensed in a  mass shift  of @xmath80 mev for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "such a shift is suggested by recent cb - taps data @xcite .",
    "the use of qcd sum rules @xcite then can be used to translate this shift into a significantly larger shift for the @xmath0 meson ( dictated essentially by the landau damping term ) ; we use here @xmath81 mev .    to illustrate the time evolution of the test particles we have shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig_evol ] the masses of four test particles randomly selected out of the ensemble representing the spectral function of an @xmath1 meson as a function of the collision time .",
    "( these curves were obtained by artificially switching off the decay of the @xmath1 mesons .",
    "otherwise they would decay in a very short time in the high density region .",
    "thus , particles with masses strongly deviating from their peak mass have little chance to radiate di - electrons off . ) the upper part shows the respective local densities of the matter surrounding these particles . the tendency to acquire their vacuum mass starting from very different initial masses",
    "is clearly seen . for the test particle depicted by the dash - dotted curve which moves with a velocity of 0.6 c we have also shown the spectral function of the @xmath1 meson at the collision times of 6 fm / c and 10 fm / c together with the vacuum function in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec ] .",
    "the obtained di - electron spectra are represented in figs .",
    "[ fig_hades_vac ] and [ fig_hades_med ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig_hades_vac ] the vacuum parameters are employed while fig .",
    "[ fig_hades_med ] shows the results obtained by including the above described medium modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . for comparison with the data the hades filter has been applied accounting for the geometrical acceptance , momentum cuts and pair kinematics",
    "the filter causes a reduction of the strength and a smearing of the invariant masses of the di - electrons .",
    "the result of this filtering is always shown on the right hand panel of the figures .    in these figures",
    "we show different contribution to the di - electron rate .",
    "important di - electron sources are @xmath82 and @xmath83 dalitz decays which are proportional to the multiplicities of their parents .",
    "the taps collaboration has measured @xcite the @xmath82 and @xmath83 production cross sections of 707@xmath8472 mb and 25@xmath844 mb for the same system and same bean energy .",
    "these values have to be compared to our calculations yielding 700 mb and 20 mb .",
    "while the value for pion production is in good agreement , there is a slight underestimation of the @xmath83 production .",
    "( note that the presently employed cross sections rely on a global fit of many elementary reactions which is not optimized for the @xmath83 channel . )",
    "the dalitz decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons and nucleon resonances do not contribute essentially .",
    "the employed elementary cross sections for @xmath85 and @xmath86 agree with the ones in @xcite which are adjusted to near - threshold data for @xmath85 .",
    "one recognizes comparing fig .",
    "[ fig_hades_vac ] and [ fig_hades_med ] that the medium modification due to collision broadening diminishes the yield of @xmath0 di - electrons .",
    "still an indication of a shoulder is expected from the calculations .",
    "our calculations do not show a considerable effect of a @xmath0 mass shift , however this finding depends sensitively on our elementary @xmath0 production rates employed in the calculations .",
    "since the fine structure is not yet resolved in the data a conclusive decision can not be made at present .",
    "in summary we have compared results of a transport code to recent measurements of the di - electron invariant mass spectrum for the reaction c(2 agev ) + c. the code incorporates the production and propagation of broad resonances , in particular @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "including even fairly schematically parameterized in - medium modifications of these vector mesons the emerging differences to results which employ vacuum parameters show up in a better agreement with the data .",
