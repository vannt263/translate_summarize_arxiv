    "the compact sizes of the central engines of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have long driven study of their distant surroundings for clues to their geometry and interaction with the surrounding galaxy .",
    "observations of gas seen many kpc from the agn itself have proven fruitful in offering views of the core from different angles , and implicitly at different times .",
    "narrowband images revealed extended emission - line regions ( eelrs ) around some luminous agn , particularly radio - loud qsos as well as radio galaxies , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "similar structures in lower - luminosity seyfert galaxies often appear as single or double triangles in projection ( @xcite , @xcite ) , generally interpreted as ionization cones . when small - scale radio jets are present , they lie within the ionization cones",
    ". however , in many cases , the gas must be ionized by radiation from the nucleus rather than direct interaction with a jet or outflow , as seen from narrow linewidths and ( particularly diagnostic ) modest electron temperatures , both of which would be much larger in the presence of shocks fast enough to match the observed ionization levels .",
    "this is particularly true for very large eelrs , where interaction with the radio jet or an origin in outflows alone become less and less likely .",
    "in fact , the best - defined ionization cones are seen in radio - quiet objects @xcite .",
    "this is one line of evidence linking large - scale structures to the small - scale obscuring regions (  tori \" ) implied by other arguments for a unification scheme @xcite , in which seyferts of types 1 and 2 are part of a single parent population , appearing different based on how our line of sight passes this torus .",
    "the emission - line structures can be large and well - resolved , offering a way to measure the opening angle over which ionizing radiation escapes .",
    "some previous studies have also noted that these emission - line clouds provide a view to the immediate past of the agn , via light - travel time to the cloud and then toward us @xcite .    using extended emission - line clouds as probes of agn history came of age with the discovery of hanny s voorwerp , a high - ionization region extending 45 kpc in projection from the low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxy ic 2497 at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "linewidths and electron temperature indicate that the gas is photoionized rather than shock - excited , while a combination of ionization - parameter and recombination arguments bound the required nuclear ionizing luminosity to be @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 . however , x - ray spectroscopy shows the nucleus of ic 2497 to be only modestly absorbed , with ionizing luminosity only @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the nucleus of ic 2497 was in fact a qso ( the nearest known luminous qso ) until roughly @xmath10 years before our current view , and has faded dramatically in the interim ; radio and hst observations offer hints that some of its energy output may have switched to kinetic forms over this timespan ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , keel et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the unlikeliness of the nearest qso showing highly unusual behaviour suggests that such variations may be common among agn , prompting us to re - examine the incidence and properties of extended ionized clouds around nearby agn .",
    "such an examination should not be confined to catalogued agn , since the most interesting objects - those which have faded dramatically - may no longer appear as spectroscopically classified agn .",
    "hanny s voorwerp was first noted by dutch teacher hanny van arkel in the course of the galaxy zoo project @xcite , on the basis of its unusual structure and colour . in view of the interest of similar ionized clouds for study of both the history and obscuration of agn ,",
    "participants in the galaxy zoo project have carried out a wide search for such clouds using data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "they examined both known agn hosts and galaxies not known to have agn , using the distinctive colour of highly - ionized regions across the sdss @xmath11 filters as a first selection criterion .",
    "we present the results of further analysis of the sdss images , narrow - band imaging , and spectroscopy , yielding a list of 19 galaxies with agn - photoionized clouds detected to beyond 10 kpc from the nuclei ( many of which are newly identified ) .",
    "we consider constraints on changes in ionizing luminosity for these , and identify several as the most likely candidates for the kind of long - term fading seen in ic 2497 and hanny s voorwerp .",
    "the galaxy zoo search for giant agn - ionized clouds combined both targeted and serendipitous approaches , to combine a complete examination of known agn hosts with the possibility of finding ionized clouds around agn which are yet unknown or in fact optically unseen . in the targeted search",
    ", we formed a sample of potential agn at @xmath12 .",
    "this combined all galaxies whose sdss pipeline emission - line ratios put them in either the agn or composite regions of the baldwin - phillips - terlevich ( bpt ) diagram ( @xcite , as revised by @xcite and @xcite ) using [ o iii]/h@xmath13 and [ n ii]/h@xmath14 , and all additional objects listed in the veron - cetty & veron catalog @xcite at @xmath12 falling within the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) area .",
    "this addition accounted for agn with no sdss nuclear spectrum , either because they are relatively bright or , more often , because fibre collisions or sampling rules prevented their selection for spectra , and type 1 agn where the pipeline spectroscopic classification is less reliable than for narrow - line objects .",
    "the merged agn sample , designed to err on the side of inclusion in borderline cases , included 18,116 objects . with a web interface designed by rp , 199 participants examined all of these within a 6-week period in 2009 , marking each as certain , possible , or lacking an extended emission region .",
    "these emission regions have distinctive signatures in both morphology and colour from the sdss data .",
    "they do not follow the usual spiral or annular distributions of star formation in disc galaxies .",
    "such regions show unusual colours in the sdss composite images , which map @xmath11 bands to blue , green , and red ( lupton et al .",
    "hence strong [ o iii ] at low redshift is rendered as a pure blue , as in the discovery of hanny s voorwerp .",
    "a combination of strong [ o iii ] and significant h@xmath14+[n ii ] appears purple ; beyond about @xmath15 , [ o iii ] falls in the gap between @xmath16 and @xmath17 filters , so our search technique loses utility until [ o iii ] is well within the @xmath17 band , when the galaxies have much smaller angular sizes .",
    "this subproject was known as the  voorwerpje hunt \" , using the dutch diminutive form of voorwerp .",
    "each galaxy was examined by at least ten participants ; 199 zoo volunteers participated in this program , seven of whom examined the entire sample .",
    "the final average number of votes was 11.2 per object .",
    "after this screening process , a straightforward ranking was by relative numbers of  yes \" ( weight=1 ) ,  maybe \" ( weight=0.5 ) , and  no \" ( weighted zero ) votes .    the most interesting results of such a search would be galaxies with prominent agn - ionized clouds in which we do nt see the agn , either because of strong obscuration or dramatic variability during the light - travel time from the nucleus to the clouds .",
    "these would not be found by targeting known agn , and neither would clouds around agn which do not have catalogued spectral information .",
    "accordingly , we also posted a request on the galaxy zoo discussion forum , with examples of confirmed agn clouds and various kinds of similar - appearing image artifacts .",
    "participants were invited to post possible cases from among the galaxies they saw in the ordinary course of the galaxy zoo classification programs @xcite , and some active users reposted examples from other discussion threads .",
    "the resulting followups provided an additional sample for investigation ; wck also checked all the threads with image discussion for more such objects , early examples of which instigated this search on the first place . to reduce the number of false positives caused by extended star - forming regions or starburst winds , objects were removed from consideration if an sdss spectrum shows emission lines characteristic of a starburst .",
    "remaining candidates were examined first on the sdss composite images for appropriate colour and geometry , and the most promising ones were carried forward for further analysis .    both targeted and serendipitous lists overlap for many objects with bright emission - line structures , and recover such well - studied cases from the literature as mkn 266 , ngc 5252 and mkn 78 ; we observed these so as to have a consistent set of spectra for comparison .",
    "the entire list of candidates is given in table [ tbl - candidates ] . in the search column ,",
    "s or t denotes whether the object was found in the serendipitous survey , the targeted survey of known agn , or both .",
    "the type of nuclear optical spectrum is listed as sy 1/1.5/1.9/2 , liner , sb for starburst , or nonagn for an ordinary stellar population .",
    "the final column indicates which galaxy zoo participant ( by user name ) first posted objects in the serendipitous survey .",
    "for both subsamples , further winnowing had the same steps .",
    "most importantly , we reanalyzed the sdss images , to verify that the features do not have continuum counterparts , and eliminate artifacts caused by imperfect registration of the images when forming the colour composites .",
    "this effect is of particular concern for seyfert 1 nuclei , where the psf of the bright nucleus can produce a decentered colour signature if one of the constituent images is slightly misregistered ; sy 1 galaxy image are more vulnerable to this artifact than normal galactic nuclei .",
    "since many candidates ( including some with spectroscopic confirmation ) have  purple haze \" on the sdss images , which could either be genuinely extended and somewhat amorphous [ o iii ] and h@xmath14 or an artifact , this was a helpful step .",
    "we adopted a tomographic approach , taking one of the sdss bands free of strong emission lines ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 , depending on redshift ) as an estimate of the structure of starlight in the galaxy .",
    "this was scaled to match the largest part of the @xmath16 structure , iteratively when necessary .",

    "these results let us rank the candidate lists from both targeted and serendipitous searches in order of significance of the emission - line structures based on the sdss images themselves .",

    "the slit width was set at 2 `` for all these observations , and the spectrographs were rotated to sample the most extended known structures of each galaxy .",
    "scheduling allowed us to reduce the kitt peak data before the first lick observing run , so that the 3 m spectra could be concentrated on the most interesting galaxies .",
    "total exposures ranged from 30 minutes , for initial reconnaissance to see whether an object might host agn clouds , to 2 hours for weaker lines in confirmed targets . either night - sky line or interspersed lamp observations",
    "were used to track flexure , as needed .",
    "reduction used the _ longslit _ package in iraf @xcite , and included rebinning to a linear wavelength scale , sky subtraction , and flux calibration .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars were observed to set the flux scale ; in a few cases where passing clouds were an issue , the spectra were scaled so that the nucleus within a @xmath28 '' region matched the flux of the sdss spectra .    our identification of these extended regions as being photoionized by agn rests on three results - location in the strong - line bpt diagram , strength of the high - ionization species he ii and [ ne v ] , and electron temperature consistent with photoionization but not with shock ionization .",
    "we classify emission regions based on the  bpt \" line - ratio diagrams pioneered for galactic nuclei by @xcite and refined by @xcite , with caution based on the possibility that some of the external gas could have much lower metal abundances than found in galactic nuclei ( as seen in hanny s voorwerp ; @xcite ) .",
    "abundance effects in gas photoionized by agn , as manifested in the bpt diagrams , have been considered in calculations by @xcite .",
    "the largest effect is higher equilibrium temperature at lower o abundance , since it is an important coolant , which drives stronger forbidden lines and higher ionization levels until very low levels ( 0.1 solar ) are reached . in any case , the abundance changes are not large enough to move these clouds across the empirical agn / starburst ionization boundary .",
    "furthermore , in the galaxies where we have data covering the red emission lines , the clouds locations in the ( essentially abundance - independent ) auxiliary bpt diagram of [ o iii]/h@xmath13 versus [ o i]/h@xmath14 also indicated photoionization by an agn continuum . the various bpt diagrams are compared for points along the slit in each of the clouds we classify as agn - ionized in fig .",
    "[ fig - bptkey ] .",
    "this classification is examined more closely in the context of its radial behavior in the next section .",
    "independent of these line ratios , strong he ii @xmath29 or [ ne v ] @xmath30 indicate photoionization by a harder continuum than provided by young stars , and resolved emission from these species is immediately diagnostic of agn photoionization in this context .",
    "for some objects , we do not have red data ; in these , we classify the cloud as agn - ionized based on the presence of the high - ionization lines or continuity of line ratios with the nucleus .",
    "line ratios in the extreme blue may be affected in subtle ways by atmospheric dispersion @xcite ; the scheduling of our observations forced us to observe most targets at hour angles which did not allow us to put the slit simultaneously along the structures of interest and close to the parallactic angle .",
    "the extended regions we observe are generally wider than the slit ; to first order line intensities are not affected by atmospheric refraction , since we calibrate with standard stars at low airmass .",
    "some of the lick blue spectra have atmospheric dispersion contributing as much as 3 \" of offset along the slit from red to blue ends of the spectrum , important only for the nuclei and corrected in extracting their spectra .",
    "the bpt diagrams are designed to separate common sources of photoionization in galaxies ; temperature and kinematic data are also important to understand whether shocks pay a significant role . in a few cases , the [ o iii ]",
    "@xmath31 line was measured in the extended clouds with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio for a measurement of the electron temperature via its ratio to the strong @xmath32 lines .",
    "using the iraf task _ temden _ , which implements the algorithm of @xcite , and considering @xmath33 @xmath34 , we find @xmath35 values of @xmath36 in the sdss 2201 + 11 , @xmath37 for mkn 266 , and @xmath38 for the teacup system .",
    "these confirm that the gas is photoionized rather than shocked ; for comparison , temperatures in the [ o iii ] zone of supernova remnants ( including some with lower ionization levels than in these clouds ) range from 20,000 - 69,000 k ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in addition ,",
    "very high shock velocities @xmath39 km s@xmath8 are needed to produce significant [ ne v ] emission @xcite .",
    "this is far in excess of the local velocity ranges we observe ( section 6 ) ; even though we would not necessarily observe material on both sides of a shock in the same ion , it is difficult to envision a situation with large - scale shocks of this velocity without observable velocity widths or structures exceeding 100 k s@xmath8 .    while not the main thrust of our survey , it is worth noting that we find a few instances of either double agn in interacting systems , or agn in the fainter member of a close pair ( mkn 177 , was 49 , possibly sdss j111100.60 - 005334.9 and sdss j142522.28 + 141126.5 ) .",
    "these may be worth deeper spectroscopy in the context of mapping agn obscuration ; if a high - ionization component can be isolated in the gas of the other galaxy , its distribution could show where ionizing radiation escapes any circumnuclear absorbing structure .",

    "it may be relevant that both mkn 78 and mkn 463 have ionized regions with relatively small projected extent , easily lost against the galaxy starlight ( which in mkn 463 is morphologically complex ) .",
    "the [ s ii ] @xmath44 lines are particularly important , tracing electron densities and thereby providing one estimate of the intensity of the impinging ionizing radiation .",
    "since the densities in these extended clouds are low , and the ratio is generally near its low - density limit , where the mapping from line ratio to density is highly nonlinear , we have examined the errors in measuring the line ratio closely .",
    "we generated multiple realizations of pixel - to - pixel noise , and each was scaled to four representative fractions of the stronger line peak .",
    "this was added to line pairs , modeled to match the line widths and pixel separation of the red lick data .",
    "gaussian fitting of the lines with added noise gave a relation between the peak signal - to - noise and error of the fitted ratio which we adopted ; we use @xmath45 error bounds to derive bounds on the density .",
    "density values were calculated using the iraf task _ temden_.",
    "seeing the effects of radiation from an agn on gas tens of kpc from the nucleus allows us the possibility of tracing dramatic changes in core luminosity .",
    "one straightforward way to approach this question is a simple energy balance .",
    "the spectra give us upper and lower bounds on the required ionizing luminosity . to probe the most extreme conditions , we analyze galaxies in which we detect ionized gas at projected distances @xmath46 kpc .",
    "for all distances and luminosities , we use the wmap  consensus \" cosmological parameters , with h@xmath47 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the lower bound comes from the highest recombination - line surface brightness we observe ; the central source must provide at least enough ionizing photons to sustain this over periods longer than the recombination timescale ( which may be as long as @xmath48 years at these low densities ) .",
    "this is a lower limit , since the actual emission - line surface brightness of some regions may be smeared out by seeing , and we do not know that a given feature is optically thick at the lyman limit .",
    "this limit depends only very weakly on the slope of the ionizing continuum , since helium will generally absorb most of the radiation shortward of its ionization edge leaving only the 13.6 - 54.4 ev range to consider for hydrogen ionization .",
    "we base our bounds on the highest implied luminosity among structures at various projected radii in a given system , with no correction for projection effects .",
    "this makes our limits conservative , since a given cloud will always lie farther from the nucleus than our projected measurement .",
    "in essence , this argument is based on the surface brightness in a recombination line ; we use h@xmath13 since we have these data for the whole sample . in a simple approximation ,",
    "we take the surface brightness in the brightest portion of a cloud , assuming this to be constant across the slit .",
    "we take the region sampled in this way to be circular in cross - section as seen from the nucleus , so its solid angle is derived from the region subtended by the slit .",

    "higher - resolution imaging in the emission lines could this increase these values .",
    "upper limits to the incident ionizing flux come from a complementary analysis using the ionization parameter ( @xmath51 , the ratio of ionizing photons to particles ) , since these emission - line features all have [ s ii ] line ratios near the low - density limit .",

    "we quote the extreme range of density values between these two cases ( allowing in the teacup an upper bound on the electron density as high as 240 @xmath34 , and in some cases limits @xmath54@xmath34 ) , since the temperature - sensitive [ o iii ] @xmath55 line ratio is not well - enough measured in most of these objects to use individual @xmath35 values .",

    "arguments for long - timescale variations in the central sources here depend on our having estimates for their total luminosity as seen directly , which could in principle fail either if their ionizing radiation were collimated by something other than obscuration , or the spectral shapes in the deep ultraviolet differ from our expectations based on the uv and x - ray behavior of familiar agn .",
    "collimation by relativistic beaming would not account for the combinations of opening angle and flux ratio required ( as found for hanny s voorwerp ; keel et al . in preparation ) .",
    "a spectral solution to the behavior would require an extreme - ultraviolet bump \" dominating the ionizing flux from 13.6 - 54 ev by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "however , known agn do not provide evident examples of either solution ; the most straightforward interpretation of the data suggests that some of these clouds are ionized by agn which have faded over the differential light - travel time between our views of the clouds and nuclei .",
    "to further characterize the agn in these galaxies , we collected radio fluxes at 1.4 ghz from the national radio astronomy observatory very large array sky survey ( nvss ) source catalog @xcite .",
    "all but two objects ( sdss 1510 + 07 and 1005 + 28 ) were detected above the 2.5 mjy survey limit ; the source luminosity l(1.4 ghz ) ranges from @xmath73 w hz@xmath8 to @xmath74 , the latter for the double source associated with ngc 5972 and comprising 94% of the galaxy s total flux .",
    "eight of the galaxies qualify as radio - loud if one uses a simple , representative division at @xmath75 w hz@xmath8 , and only one lies above 10@xmath76 .",
    "this one - ngc 5972 - represents an interesting departure from the usual alignment of emission - line and radio structure ( section 7 ) .",
    "the examples of hanny s voorwerp @xcite and ngc 5252 @xcite suggest that a common source of extraplanar gas at large radii is tidal debris .",
    "the host morphologies of the galaxies where we find extended ionized clouds support this notion .",
    "table [ tbl - morphology ] lists morphological information on these galaxies , including warps , close companions , asymmetries , or ongoing mergers .",

    "several of these galaxies show discs seen nearly edge - on . from these",
    ", it is clear that the ionizing radiation can emerge well away from the disc poles . the projected angles from stellar disc to the axis of the ionized clouds , when it is well defined , range from 3054@xmath4 .",
    "this fits with the statistics reported by @xcite , in which obscured ( type 2 ) objects show a wider range of angle than type 1 objects between the host - galaxy axes and the agn axes as traced by radio jets .",
    "we see both one- and two - sided emission regions .",
    "the two - sided regions are generally highly symmetric in angular location , although not necessarily in radial extent or surface brightness , fitting with biconical illumination patterns .",
    "as listed in table [ tbl - morphology ] , 9 of 19 of our confirmed objects have emission detected on both sides of the nucleus . particularly in very disturbed systems",
    ", a strong asymmetry may reflect the location of cold gas rather than the pattern of escaping ionizing radiation , so that we can not necessarily conclude that the one - sided clouds are in galaxies that do not have two - sided radiation patterns    the angular width of regions of escaping radiation may constrain the geometry of obscuring regions , if the ionization is bounded by the availability of radiation rather than gas .",
    "we list , in table [ tbl - morphology ] , a cone angle , which is the projected angular width of each half of a notional bicone encompassing all the high - ionization regions seen in our images , outside of a usual nuclear emission region ( fig .",
    "[ fig - angles ] ) .",
    "projection effects make the observed angle an upper limit to the three - dimensional opening angle of a cone .",
    "the sample of large emission clouds exhibits a wide range , from 23112@xmath4 .",
    "the narrower ones are challenging to understand from obscuration by a circumnuclear torus , suggesting absorbers that are geometrically quite thick compared to the opening angle for escape of ionizing radiation , to an extent which might better be described as an obscuring shell with small polar holes .",
    "however , some of these objects have dual clouds in very symmetric locations , which would be most naturally explained by such a scheme .    .",
    "the disc angle , defined only for highly inclined and reasonably symmetric host disks , is measured from the projected major axis of the disc to the midpoint of the cloud ( bi)cones . the cone angle , as shown , measures the width of the paired triangles about the nucleus that encompass the extranuclear emission detected in available images .",
    "the base image is the sdss @xmath17 observation of sdss 2201 + 11 , with the [ o iii ] clouds shown schematically . ]",
    "several of the two - sided clouds show near - symmetry in radial extent on opposite sides of the galaxy .",
    "this could reflect episodic activity on the light - travel time scale , although front - back geometric effects would generally break an exact symmetry .",
    "extended ionized regions around agn may commonly be separated into kinematically quiescent components , such as would be seen for disk gas ionized from the nucleus , and outflow , with additional superimposed radial motion which might be manifested in a well - sampled velocity field as misalignment of the velocity field with the galaxy morphology if the superimposed velocity components are not spectrally resoved @xcite .",
    "in addition , for disturbed systems , tidal features may show motions decoupled from the disk itself .",

    "similarly , the emission clouds in ngc 5972 fall along an extrapolation of the inner - disk rotation curve ( as traced by [ o iii ] ) . despite its very disturbed morphology ,",
    "ugc 11185 shows near - symmetry in kinematics , with a very strong velocity gradient crossing the nucleus .",
    "other systems in our sample show less ordered velocity slices .",

    "multiple components are seen in the inner few arcseconds , even in [ ne v ] @xcite .",
    "the northern filament in mkn 266 presents interesting kinematic behavior , with a large and consistent velocity offset between [ o iii ] and h@xmath14 , h@xmath13 .",
    "this difference is seen in spectra from both spectrographs .",
    "a likely explanation is superposition of structures with quite different ionization states as well as velocity , so that the weighting of lines in our spectra , even though they are not separately resolved , gives different velocity centroids .",
    "the offset is close to 50 km s@xmath8 along the entire filament .",
    "localized instances of similar mismatches between [ o iii ] and h@xmath13 velocities on one side of sdss 2201 + 11 and possibly in ncg 5972 .",
    "outflows are typically inferred from blue wings on [ o iii ] , but far from the nuclei where disk extinction is unlikely to be a major effect ; outflows could produce relative redshifts or blueshifts .",
    "one corollary of this distinction is that there exists a gas component of much higher excitation than implied by the ionization parameter we derived from ratios of total line flux at these locations , suggesting higher ionizing luminosities in these galaxies .",
    "[ fig - velocity2 ]    the relatively quiescent kinematics of most of these features may indicate a contrast in origin of the extended gas when compared with the radio - loud qsos ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in their sample , modest star - formation rates led them to suggest that much of the ionized gas was expelled from the system by the launch of powerful radio jets .",
    "the galaxies in our eelr sample are mostly radio - quiet ( or at least radio - weak ) , as noted above .",
    "also unlike their qso sample , we see significant metallicity differences between the nuclei and eelrs , most strongly shown in the [ n ii]/h@xmath14 ratio , again consistent with the eelr gas having an external tidal origin .",
    "from our results or previously reported data , several of these galaxies have interesting individual features .",
    "the inner parts of the eelr in mkn 78 have long been known ( @xcite , who detected much of the [ o iii ] extent we observe ) , and observed with hst in both imaging and spectroscopic modes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed fit to the hst radial velocities explains the double line profiles near the core without requiring a second agn @xcite ; optical and near - ir line spectra suggest that the gas is photoionized from the nucleus with at most a very localized role for excitation by interaction with small - scale radio jets ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our data also show the complex spatial and velocity structure in the inner few arcseconds .",

    "our implied limits from photoionization balance via surface brightness in h@xmath13 are significantly greater than the values suggested from pressure balance with the galaxy s hot ism @xcite , while we concur with the x - ray results that the ionization parameter remains roughly constant with radius among the ionized features . in turn , the interpretation of this behavior depends on fine structure ( much still unresolved ) in the emission - line filaments , as seen in hanny s voorwerp @xcite .",
    "two objects in this sample appear to violate the usual pattern of ionization cones encompassing radio - source axes .",
    "ngc 5972 is the most radio - luminous of our galaxies , and shows a typical double - lobed structure @xcite .",

    "similarly , mkn 1498 is associated with a giant low - frequency double radio source @xcite , with projected separation 1.1 mpc . in this case",
    "as well , the orientations of the emission - line structures and the large radio source differ strongly , by about @xmath80 .",

    "ugc 11185 shows a second , weaker set of emission - line components near the nucleus , peaking about 1.8 `` to the east along our slit , roughly 600 km s@xmath8 to the red of the main peaks , and including about 1/4 of the nuclear [ o iii ] flux within a @xmath28 '' aperture .    in both mkn 463 and mkn 739 , _",
    "imaging has furnished evidence for double agn ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in both cases ,",

    "more detailed [ o iii ] images could resolve this",
    ". however the flux sources are apportioned between components , one agn in each system must have an ionizing / fir ratio at least as high as our tabulated limit .",

    "volunteers in the galaxy zoo project have carried out a search for agn - ionized gas clouds on large scales ( 10 - 40 kpc ) .",
    "this paper has documented the search , and spectroscopic observations of candidates yielding 19 such features .",
    "these clouds were classified as agn - photoionized based on their locations in the baldwin - phillips - terlevich ( bpt ) line - ratio diagrams , strength of [ ne v ] and he ii emission , and ( when measurements are sufficient ) modest electron temperatures @xmath81 k , consistent with photoionization but not with shock heating .",
    "most of the host galaxies show signs of interaction , suggesting that the extended ionized gas in many cases rises from tidal tails .",
    "we consider upper and lower bounds to the luminosity of the agn as it reached the clouds - lower limits from recombination and upper limits from density and ionization parameter .",
    "we compare these with the obscured luminosity estimated from far - infrared measurements ; an excess in ionizing luminosity ( or deficit in the far - ir ) could signal long - term variability of the agn .",
    "the ratio of ionizing to obscured luminosity spans a wide range , from 0.02 to @xmath5 . over a third of them ( 7/19 )",
    "exceed unity , making this kind of energy deficit a common issue .",
    "small values fit with an origin in obscured agn , requiring only a small fraction of the extreme ultraviolet to escape .",
    "in contrast , large values may require a long - term fading of the agn .",
    "an extreme case of this is represented by hanny s voorwerp near ic 2497 @xcite . in this object",
    ", the required ionizing flux indicates that the agn has faded by a factor @xmath82 within the last @xmath83 years , sampling a timescale on which we otherwise have no information .",
    "more detailed observations of this new sample , including pending x - ray measurements , could give statistics adequate to show how common such variations are .",
    "an important use of this sample is in addressing the history of agn luminosity - on what timescales do episodes of high luminosity persist and fade ?",
    "broad arguments suggest that agn episodes extend over spans comparable to the duration of a galaxy merger ( several 10@xmath84 years ) , if statistics associating excess agn with strong interactions and mergers are representative .",
    "we note that establishing a link between galaxy interactions and agn episodes has proven remarkably elusive , with the results depending on details of comparison sample selection and what kind of agn is studied ; as recent examples , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reached different conclusions - a null result , enhancement limited to certain kinds of agn , or a weak overall enhancement of agn - from similar analysis of nearby galaxy samples . therefore ,",
    "even within such long timespans , we have little information on how episodic the accretion and associated luminous output might be .",
    "the relevant equation for time delay between radiation reaching us directly from the nucleus and that reprocessed in a cloud follow usage for light echos in ordinary reflection , except that here we are constrained by the location of gas so we deal with a constant observed radius @xmath85 and unknown angle @xmath86 between the illumination direction and the plane of the sky ; and the long recombination times at low density impose a convolution with a nontrivial time span for response . with the geometry defined in fig .",
    "[ fig - echo ] , keeping @xmath85 fixed by the observations means that the geometrical time delay @xmath87 for observing reprocessed nuclear radiation depends on the the viewing angle @xmath86 ( from observer to nucleus to the cloud , with a cloud along the line of sight at zero and increasing away from the observer ) as given by @xmath88 derived in the approximation of infinite distance from the observer .",
    "two - sided symmetric sets of clouds have progressively much longer differential delays when seen with their axis near the line of sight , so that a faded source in this regime should eventually be seen ionizing only the farside cloud .",
    "our ability to reconstruct the actual distribution of @xmath86 is hampered by an inner cutoff in @xmath85 ( 10 kpc , so that the cloud detection is not hampered by galaxy starlight ) and lack of knowledge of the distribution of cloud extent from the nuclei . to be conservative",
    ", our calculations of ionizing luminosity ( above ) assume @xmath89 , the minimum possible distance for the nucleus and thus minimal ionizing luminosity ,     between radiation seen directly from the nucleus and reprocessed through a cloud at distance @xmath90 from the nucleus , as a function of angle @xmath86 from the line of sight , for fixed value of projected radius @xmath85 .",
    "the inset diagram shows the geometric quantities .",
    "units of @xmath87 are @xmath91 ]    we might expect our sample to be complete at least for the lowest redshifts and highest surface brightnesses , but there are a few objects with selection priority as high as some of our cloud hosts for which we do not yet have confirming optical spectra . of our 19 confirmations , 14 were found in both the targeted and serendipitous searches .",
    "two were found only in the targeted search , and 3 in the serendipitous search .",
    "of these 3 , one ( sdss j095559.88 + 395446.9 ) had no previous optical spectrum and could not have been included in the targeted sample .",
    "a first hint as to characteristic timescales comes for the relative numbers of galaxies with and without deficits in ionizing luminosity , since the ones with deficits in the energy budget would be seen during the appropriate delay time after fading of the nucleus .",
    "there is no obvious reason for this ratio to be biased in our sample , since the serendipitous survey was independent of the presence of an agn , and even in the targeted search there are many agn which are too weak to ionize the extended gas ; in essence , given a luminous agn , our selection is for objects with outlying gas available to be ionized . in a toy model where all objects delay times @xmath87 are equal , the timescale for the agn to be at high luminosity before fading would be of order @xmath92 . from table",
    "[ tbl - energy ] , our estimate is @xmath93 when we divide the bright and faded groups at an ionizing / fir ratio of 1.5 . the projected extent of the clouds @xmath94 from our [ o iii ] data is listed in table [ tbl - morphology ] ; for the 19 galaxies in our sample , the mean value is 19 kpc with a median of 17 . for a typical projected extent 20 kpc ,",
    "this becomes a range 25,000175,000 years , taking the sample to populate values of @xmath95 at this small sample size .",
    "for the luminosity range of seyfert galaxies we have probed , the fading may be an order of magnitude in ionizing luminosity , but this sample includes no cases in which we see agn - ionized clouds around a galaxy with no optical trace of an agn .",
    "ic 2497 @xcite must be extreme in this respect , having faded from a qso to a borderline liner./sy 2 nucleus .",
    "as noted by @xcite , these timescales are rapid compared to expectations from scaling up the behavior of accretion disks around stellar - mass black holes , perhaps indicating that disk self - gravity enhances the growth of accretion instabilities .",
    "there are several directions in which we can expand this study . in a ",

    "<S> some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are surrounded by extended emission - line regions ( eelrs ) , which trace both the illumination pattern of escaping radiation and its history over the light - travel time from the agn to the gas . from a new set of such eelrs , we present evidence that the agn in many seyfert galaxies undergo luminous episodes 0.22@xmath0 years in duration . motivated by the discovery of the spectacular nebula known as hanny s voorwerp , ionized by a powerful agn which has apparently faded dramatically within @xmath1 years </S>",
    "<S> , galaxy zoo volunteers have carried out both targeted and serendipitous searches for similar emission - line clouds around low - redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we present the resulting list of candidates and describe spectroscopy identifying 19 galaxies with agn - ionized regions at projected radii @xmath2 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this search recovered known eelrs ( such as mkn 78 , mkn 266 , and ngc 5252 ) and identified additional previously unknown cases , one with detected emission to @xmath3 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> one new sy 2 was identified . </S>",
    "<S> at least 14/19 are in interacting or merging systems , suggesting that tidal tails are a prime source of distant gas out of the galaxy plane to be ionized by an agn . </S>",
    "<S> we see a mix of one- and two - sided structures , with observed cone angles from 23112@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the energy balance in the ionized clouds , with lower and upper bounds on ionizing luminosity from recombination and ionization - parameter arguments , and estimate the luminosity of the core from the far - infrared data . </S>",
    "<S> the implied ratio of ionizing radiation seen by the clouds to that emitted by the nucleus , on the assumption of a nonvariable nuclear source , ranges from 0.02 to @xmath5 ; 7/19 exceed unity . small values fit well with a heavily obscured agn in which only a small fraction of the ionizing output escapes to be traced by surrounding gas </S>",
    "<S> however , large values may require that the agn has faded over tens of thousands of years , giving us several examples of systems in which such dramatic long - period variation has occurred ; this is the only current technique for addressing these timescales in agn history . </S>",
    "<S> the relative numbers of faded and non - faded objects we infer , and the projected extents of the ionized regions , give our estimate ( 0.22@xmath0 years ) for the length of individual bright phases .    </S>",
