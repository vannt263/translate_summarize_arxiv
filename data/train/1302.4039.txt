    "weak measurement introduced by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite in 1988 is universal in the sense that any generalized measurements can be realized as a sequence of weak measurements which result in small changes to the quantum state for all outcomes @xcite .",
    "weak measurement is very useful , much progress has been made in this interesting field , including the contribution of the probe dynamics to the weak measurement @xcite , such as weak measurement with arbitrary probe @xcite , entangled probes @xcite , a qubit probe @xcite , weak measurement with a spin observable @xcite , and so on .",
    "in addition , weak measurement realized by some experiments is also very useful for high - precision measurements .",
    "for example , hosten and kwiat @xcite use the weak measurement to observe the spin hall effect in light ; dixon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite apply the weak measurement to detect very small transverse beam deflections ; gillett _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite study the weak measurement to examine the feedback control of quantum systems in the presence of noise .",
    "the quantum correlations of quantum states include entanglement and other kinds of nonclassical correlations .",
    "it is well accepted that the quantum correlations are more general than entanglement @xcite .",
    "a canonical measure of quantum correlations is the quantum discord @xcite which describes the quantumness of correlations .",
    "it quantifies how much a system can be disrupted when we observe it to obtain the classical information .",
    "remarkable developments have been achieved toward the importance and applications of quantum discord . in particular , there are some precise expressions for quantum discord for two - qubit states , such as for the @xmath0 states @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the quantum correlations about those states is also investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , researches on the dynamics of quantum discord in various noisy environments have revealed many attractive features @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated that discord is more robust than entanglement for both markovian and non - markovian dissipative processes .",
    "besides quantum discord , a lot of other measures of quantum correlations have been given , such as the quantum deficit @xcite , measurement - induced disturbance @xcite , symmetric discord @xcite , relative entropy of discord and dissonance @xcite , geometric discord @xcite , and continuous - variable discord @xcite .",
    "a nice review paper about quantum correlations can be found in @xcite . among them , the work deficit @xcite is one operational approach to quantify quantum correlations . from the physical point of view",
    ", quantum deficit originates in describing a process which tries to extract work by nonlocal operation from a correlated system coupled to a heat bath in the case of pure states .",
    "it can be related to more general forms of quantum correlations .",
    "similarly , quantum discord can also be justified by a physical interpretation @xcite by that the erasure of quantum correlations must lead to entropy production in the system and the environment @xcite .",
    "similar to quantum discord , oppenheim _",
    "_ propose a definition of work deficit and verify that quantum deficit is equal to the difference of the mutual information and classical deficit @xcite .",
    "some simple forms of deficit are found in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the classical information deficit @xcite is lower - bounded by the ( regularized ) relative entropy of entanglement for werner and isotropic states @xcite .",
    "recently , the definition of the one - way deficit is given by the relative entropy over all local von neumann measurements on one subsystem which reveals the fundamental role of quantum correlations as a resource for the distribution of entanglement @xcite .",
    "other definitions of the one - way deficit by von neumann measurements on one subsystem are also proposed @xcite .    quantum discord and the one - way deficit both are quantum correlations based on von neumann measurement . since the fundamental role of weak measurements , it is interesting to know how those quantum correlations will be for weak measurement ?",
    "recently , it is shown that weak measurement performed on one of the subsystems can lead to `` super - quantum discord '' that is always larger than the normal quantum discord captured by the strong ( projective ) measurements @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether weak measurements can always capture more quantumness of correlations . in this article",
    ", we propose a definition of the weak one - way deficit by weak measurement .",
    "interestingly , by tuning continuously from strong measurement to weak measurement , the discrepancy between the super - quantum discord and weak one - way deficit becomes larger . in comparison with super - quantum discord which is larger than the standard discord",
    ", the weak one - way deficit decreases for weak measurement , while they are completely the same for projective measurement . in this sense , weak measurement does not always capture more quantumness of correlations .",
    "it depends on the specified measure of quantum correlations .",
    "we calculate the weak one - way deficit for werner states and compare super - quantum correlation with quantum correlation in sect .",
    "we give super - quantum discord for bell - diagonal states and depict the level surface of constant super - quantum discord and quantun discord in sect .",

    "since werner state is rotationally invariant , therefore , one gets the same result for the entropy of the state after measurement for any measurement basis .",

    "in fact , the @xmath31-dimensional bipartite werner state satisfies @xmath32 for all unitary operators @xmath33 acting on @xmath34-dimensional hilbert space , and such unitary transformations do not change the entropy of the state .",
