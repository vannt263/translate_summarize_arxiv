    "the main aim of the author in this paper is to present a new tool which can make easier the study of the real dynamics of families of iterative methods which depends on a certain parameter or even the study of an iterative method applied to a uniparametric family of polynomials .",
    "this tool can be modified in order to extend , amongst other ones , to methods which needs two approximations as for example , secant - type methods , modified newton s method , etc .",
    "the dynamics of iterative methods used for solving nonlinear equations in complex plane has been studied recently by many authors @xcite .",
    "there exists a belief that real dynamics is included in the complex dynamics but this is not true at all .",
    "for example in the real dynamics one can proof the monotone convergence which does not exist in the complex plane , there exists also asymptotes in the real dynamics but in the complex one that concept has no sense or the point @xmath0 in the complex plane can be studied as another point but in the real line it is not possible . as a consequence",
    "real dynamics is not contained in the complex dynamics and both must be studied separately .",
    "taking into account that distinction , many authors @xcite have begun to study it since few years ago .",
    "if one focus the attention on families of iterative methods studied in the complex plane , parameter spaces have given rise to methods whose dynamics are not well - known .",
    "these parameter spaces consist on studying the orbits of the free critical points associating each point of the plane with a complex value of the parameter .",
    "several authors @xcite have studied really interesting dynamical and parameter planes in which they have found some anomalies such as convergence to @xmath1-cycles , convergence to @xmath2 , or even chaotical behavior . in the real line , there exists tools such as feigenbaum diagrams or lyapunov exponents that allow us to study what happens with a concrete point , but it is really hard to study each point in a separate way .",
    "this is the main motivation of the author to present the new tool called _ the convergence plane_.    _ the convergence plane _ is obtained by associating each point of the plane with a value of the starting point and a value of the parameter .",
    "that is , _ the convergence plane _ is based on taking the vertical axis as the value of the parameter and the horizontal axis as the starting point , so every point in the plane represents an initial estimation and a member of the family .",
    "if one draws a straight horizontal line in a concrete value of the parameter , the dynamical behavior , for that value , for every starting point is on that line . on the other hand ,",
    "if the straight line is vertical , the dynamical behavior for that starting point and every value of the parameter is on that line , this is the information that gives feigenbaum diagrams or lyapunov exponents , so both tools are included .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] the algorithm of _ the convergence plane _ is shown and in section [ s3 ] an example of _ the convergence plane _ associated to the damped newton s method applied to the polynomial @xmath3 is provided in order to validate the tool .",
    "finally , the conclusion are shown in the concluding section [ s4 ] .",
    "as it is said in the introduction each point of the plane corresponds to a starting point and a value of the parameter , in other words the pair @xmath4 represents that the study is developed using @xmath5 as the starting point and @xmath6 as the value of the parameter .",
    "the algorithm of this new tool is the following one :    * the fixed points of the method must be computed . * then , a color is assigned to each fixed point .",
    "* moreover , the region in which one wants to study the family , @xmath7 , the maximum number of iterations , @xmath8 , and the tolerance , @xmath9 , are prefixed . * then , a grid of @xmath10 points in @xmath7 of the initial points and values of the parameter must be chosen . * if after @xmath8 iterations of the family with @xmath6 as the value of the parameter , the point @xmath5 does not converge to any of the fixed points that point must be black . * if one is interested on representing the convergence to any cycle or other behavior such as convergence to extraneous fixed points , divergence etc .",
    ", there exists the possibility of assigning a color to that behaviors too .",
    "once _ the convergence plane _ has been computed it is easy to distinguish the pairs @xmath11 for which the element of the family is convergent to any of the roots using @xmath5 as a starting point .",
    "so this tool provides a global vision about what points converges and shows what are the best choices of the parameters to ensure the greatest basin of attraction .",
    "moreover , it can be used also as a tool that show how the basins of attraction of a family changes with the value of the parameter or even to study the convergence of methods which depend on 2 points such as , for example , secant - type methods .      in this moment",
    ", the author is going to explain how figure [ fig1 ] and figure [ fig2 ] of this paper were generated . to do this , it is shown the mathematica programs that has been used which are a modification of the ones that appears in @xcite . in concrete ,",
    "in the example the region will be @xmath12\\times [ 2,2.26]$ ] ( the season of taking that values is in @xcite and will appear in section 3 ) .",
    "moreover , a number of iterations @xmath13 , a tolerance of @xmath14 and a grid of @xmath15 have been taken .",
    "first of all , the function , the roots and the procedure that identifies the root to which converge the iterations have been defined as    .... f[x_]:=x^3-x ;    rootf[1]=-1 ; rootf[2]=0 ; rootf[3]=1 ;    rootposition = compile[{{z,_real } } ,      which [      abs[z - rootf[1 ] ] <   10.0^(-6 ) , 1 ,          abs[z - rootf[2 ] ] <",
