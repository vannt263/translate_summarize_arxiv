    "in recent years the exotic majorana bound state ( mbs ) is the focus of investigations in condensed matter physics .",
    "different platforms for obtaining an mbs and variety of setups for experimental observation were suggested @xcite .",
    "in particular a zero bias peak ( zbp ) in the conductance was predicted @xcite .",
    "the leading candidate is semiconductor quantum wire in proximity with an s - wave superconductor - a system that generates a topological superconductor ( ts ) with two mbs s at its ends .",
    "a signature of an mbs in tunneling data has been detected in normal metal - ts junctions @xcite , though the evidence is not conclusive @xcite .",
    "an alternative setup has been suggested @xcite for detecting an aharonov -bohm ( ab ) interference between an mbs and a quantum dot , predicting structure in the tunneling data .",
    "furthermore , zero frequency shot noise has been studied @xcite .",
    "a significant inspiration for our present work are esr - stm ( electron spin resonance - scanning tunneling microscopy ) data @xcite where the power spectrum of the stm current shows a signal at the larmor frequency .",
    "this spin resonance phenomena under stationary conditions is significant both as a method for single spin detection as well as a theoretical challenge .",
    "recently we showed @xcite that in a nanoscopic interferometer the spin - orbit interactions allow for an interference of two tunneling paths resulting in a resonance effect .    in the present work we consider a nanoscopic interferometer of one mbs and a quantum dot , the latter having a zeeman splitting ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the system consists of a metal lead , a zeeman split quantum dot and an mbs at the edge of a topological superconductor , all forming an interference loop .",
    "we evaluate the current noise power as a function of frequency which has a number of strong resonances that depend on the larmor frequency and on the tunneling strength between the mbs and the quantum dot .",
    "in particular we find a resonance at a renormalized larmor frequency .",
    "we note that spin orbit coupling is not essential for having these resonances since the mbs itself provides spin mixing .",
    "we also evaluate the current - voltage relation and find a zbp in the conductance , independent of magnetic field , as well as side peaks that shift with magnetic field .",
    "we find that the zbp has the unitary limit @xmath0 for all parameters , while the side peaks also reach this unitary limit for weak tunneling .",
    "we note that a zbp can also occur with a magnetic impurity producing a shiba state @xcite or in a class d disordered superconductors @xcite or with other types of disorder @xcite . in a magnetic field",
    "the zbp of a shiba state shows , in principle , a zeeman splitting while the disordered case @xcite is insensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "we propose that detection of the following unusual phenomena provides a strong support , possibly conclusive , for the presence of an mbs : ( i ) larmor related resonances in the current noise , ( ii ) unitary limit for the zbp , and ( iii ) conduction peaks at voltages related to the resonances , that approach the unitary limit for weak tunneling .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system consists of the normal metal lead part @xmath1 , the quantum dot @xmath2 and the tunnel couplings @xmath3 parts .",

    "@xmath5 is the density of states in the normal lead and the resonance widths turn out to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 , consistent with golden rule estimates .",
    "the normal lead has a voltage bias @xmath8 ; we assume that @xmath8 is large compared to all the above energy scales in the system , including the larmor frequency ( though @xmath8 is below the superconducting gap ) .",
    "we also assume that the mbs is well separated from other mbss , e.g. at the other end of a ts wire , and therefore neglect the coupling between them .",

    "the noise power consists of two contributions @xmath56 , eqs .",
    "b1 in the appendix b. @xmath57 includes a single majorana gf which has no structure ( no spin ) and can not show a spin resonance on its own .",
    "we note also that in a setup with only direct tunneling between the normal lead and majorana state , i.e. @xmath58 , the @xmath59 dependence of the noise is weak . to see this let us take the voltage large ( but below the superconducting gap ) and temperature @xmath60 , then the @xmath61 term is exponentially small .",

    "this term depends on two majorana gf ( see eq . b2 in appendix b ) and describes processes like those shown by the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "2 . this diagram belongs to a set whose hallmark are resonances related to a renormalized larmor frequency . in the following we usually assume no spin orbit interaction i.e. @xmath63 and equal tunnelings @xmath64 .",

    "<S> we calculate the current noise power spectrum in a nanoscopic interferometer consisting of a majorana bound state ( mbs ) and a localized spin . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for large voltage ( though less than the superconducting gap ) several strong resonance peaks appear at frequencies that depend on the zeeman splitting of the localized spin and on its tunneling to the localized spin . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the differential conductance and find the unitary limit peak @xmath0 at zero voltage as well as peaks at voltages corresponding to the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that detection of the resonances and related peaks in the differential conductance provide a strong support for the presence of an mbs . </S>"
