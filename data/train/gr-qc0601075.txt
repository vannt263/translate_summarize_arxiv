    "experimental tests of the equivalence principle ( ep ) are of seminal relevance as probes of general relativity .",
    "the equivalence principle is tested by observing its consequence , namely the universality of free fall , whereby in a gravitational field all bodies fall with the same acceleration regardless of their mass and composition .",
    "they therefore require two test masses of different composition , falling in the field of another ` source ' mass , and a read - out system to detect their motions relative to one another .",
    "an ep violation would result in a differential displacement of the masses in the direction of the source mass , which can not be explained on the basis of known , classical phenomena ( _ e.g. _ tidal effects ) .",
    "the landmark experiment by etvs and collaborators  @xcite has established that a torsion balance is most well suited for ground tests of the ep , thanks to its inherently differential nature . with the test masses suspended on a torsion balance they improved previous pendulum experiments by almost @xmath3 orders of magnitude , showing no violation for @xmath0 larger than a few @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "several decades later , by exploiting the @xmath5-hr modulation of the signal in the gravitational field of the sun , torsion balance tests have improved to @xmath6  @xcite and then to @xmath7  @xcite . more recently ,",
    "systematic and very careful tests carried out by adelberger and co - workers using _ rotating _ torsion balances have provided even more firm evidence that no violation occurs to the level of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the relevant theoretical question for equivalence principle tests is : at which accuracy level a violation , if any , is to be expected ? in an earlier work by damour and polyakov , based on string theory and the existence of the dilaton  @xcite , @xmath0 values at which a violation might be observed have been determined to be in the range @xmath8 .",
    "fischbach and coworkers  @xcite have derived a non - perturbative rigorous result , according to which a violation must occur at the level of @xmath9 , due to the coupling between gravity and processes of @xmath10 exchange which should differently affect masses with different nuclei . more recent work  @xcite suggests , in a new theoretical framework for the dilaton , that a violation might occur already at the level of @xmath11 , depending on the composition of the masses .    while an @xmath2 , and perhaps smaller , should be accessible with rotating torsion balance experiments on the ground , a sensitivity as high as @xmath9 could be achieved only by an experiment flying in low earth orbit , where the driving acceleration is up to three orders of magnitude larger .",
    "specific instruments have been designed to carry out such an experiment in space : step , microscope and `` galileo galilei '' ( gg )  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they share two features : that the test masses are concentric cylinders , and that rotation of the spacecraft provides signal modulation at frequencies higher than the orbital one .",
    "gg is peculiar in that it spins around the symmetry axis and is sensitive to relative displacements in the plane perpendicular to it : cylindrical symmetry of the whole system and rotation around the symmetry axis allow passive attitude stabilization of the spacecraft with no need of a motor after initial spin up to the nominal frequency ( typically @xmath12 hz ) .",
    "the planar ( instead of linear ) sensitivity of the instrument is also a crucial feature for allowing us to rotate at supercritical speeds , _",
    "i.e. _ faster than the natural frequencies of the system .",
    "faster rotation means modulation of the signal at higher frequency and therefore a reduced @xmath13 noise ( for @xmath13 noise see _",
    "e.g. _ the website maintained by w. li  @xcite ) .",
    "gg differs from the other proposed space experiments also in that the test masses are suspended mechanically .",
    "we find that in absence of weight , as it is the case in space , mechanical suspensions too can provide extremely weak coupling , with the additional advantage to electrically ground the test masses .",
    "the gg design naturally allows us to build and test a full scale @xmath14-g version of the apparatus : by suspending the instrument on a rotating platform through its spin / symmetry axis , the sensitive plane lies in the horizontal plane of the laboratory where a component of an ep violation signal might be detected , similarly to a torsion balance experiment .",
    "`` galileo galilei on the ground '' ( ggg )  @xcite is primarily a prototype for testing the main novel features of the experiment proposed for flight .",
    "it is also an ep experiment in its own right aiming to compete with torsion balance tests  @xcite . in this effort ,",
    "motor noise , low frequency terrain tilts  @xcite and tidal perturbations  @xcite are the main issues to be addressed .",
    "a full knowledge of the dynamical response of the ggg rotor is needed , especially in view of its condition of supercritical rotation , and of its common mode rejection behavior .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the dynamical properties of the rotor , together with the construction of a full simulation facility , would allow us to predict and interpret the collected experimental data ; they also provide a virtual environment for planning the experiment and optimizing its performance .    with these motivations in mind ,",
    "we demonstrate that a simple but very effective mathematical model can be set up to quantitatively describe the dynamical properties of the ggg rotor . in this paper ( part i )",
    ", we determine the normal modes in all regimes , from subcritical to supercritical rotation , and address the issue of self - centering in supercritical rotation . in the following paper ( part ii )",
    ", we provide the dependence of the common mode rejection ratio on various system parameters which govern the design of the instrument .",
    "the differential equations in the model are solved by means of a user - friendly simulation program and the numerical solutions are tested against the data available from the experiment .",
    "the physical content of the model is also discussed by means of approximate analytical solutions , which provide useful physical insight .",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : gggscheme ] ) transmits the digital signal from the rotor to the non - rotating frame from where it is taken out of the vacuum chamber through electrical feed - throughs .",
    "\\(3 ) an annular disk , in two semicircular parts , is mounted around the upper half of the suspension tube and contains the two capacitance - bridge circuits and their preamplifiers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gggscheme ] ) . the necessary electronics to demodulate the signal and convert it from analogue to digital form , as well as the drivers for the optical emitter",
    "are also located here .      for detecting an ep violation signal",
    "the instrument relies on its sensitivity to relative displacement of the two test masses , which in the final design will be made of different materials .",
    "an acceleration in the horizontal plane of the laboratory acting differently between the test cylinders gives rise to a relative displacement of the two in the direction of the acceleration .",
    "this displacement unbalances the capacitance bridges and gives rise to an electric voltage proportional to it .",
    "a modulation of the displacement , as seen by the capacitance plates , is achieved by setting the whole system in rotation around the vertical axis of symmetry passing through the shaft , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gggscheme ] . note that the signal modulation obtained in this way",
    "does not affect the centers of mass of the test cylinders , hence it does not affect their relative displacement , which is the physical quantity measured in the experiment . as a result , this type of modulation reduces the noise but not the signal .",
    "in point of fact , this signal modulation could be achieved by keeping the test cylinders stationary and rotating only the capacitance plates ( located in between the two , indicated as @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gggscheme ] ) which form the differential motion detector system described above .",
    "however , by rotating the test cylinders together with the capacitors , any irregularity in their mass distribution averages out ; moreover , the supercritical regime can be exploited to reduce rotation noise for all parts of the apparatus ( see sec .",
    "[ whirl ] and appendix  [ secressc ] ) . as for the experiment in space , rotation of the whole spacecraft has two more very important advantages . in the first place ,",
    "it eliminates the need for motor and ball bearings altogether , which are a considerable source of noise in the ground experiment .",
    "secondly , by rotating around the axis of maximum moment of inertia , the spacecraft is _ passively _ stabilized , thus reducing its weight , cost and complexity , as well as disturbances on the ep experiment .",
    "an ep violation signal in the gravitational field of either the earth or the sun would have a component in the horizontal plane of the laboratory which could be detected by the instrument .",
    "since the test bodies are rotors suspended on the earth , and the earth rotates around its axis , this diurnal rotation gives rise to large gyroscopic effects on the test bodies resulting in a non zero differential acceleration which would mask an ep violation signal in the field of the earth itself .",
    "measurements of such gyroscopic effects have been reported in  @xcite ( sec .",
    "the instrument @xmath1 in this ground based version@xmath1 is therefore used for two purposes : _",
    "i ) _ to establish its sensitivity as a prototype of the flight instrument , namely for an expected signal at the orbital frequency of the satellite ( @xmath42 hz , _",
    "i.e. _ about @xmath14 and half hour period , at an earth orbiting altitude of @xmath43 km ) ; _ ii ) _ to look for an ep violation in the gravitational field of the sun , in which case the signature of the signal ( see  @xcite , sec .",
    "2 ) would have a dominant fourier component of @xmath5-hr period due to the diurnal rotation of the earth .",
    "the differential character of the whole instrument , namely its capability to reject accelerations which are common to both test masses , is in principle ensured by the geometry and mounting of the test masses .",
    "it is further augmented by the differential nature of the dmd system .    _",
    "( i ) _ the sensitivity of the instrument to differential accelerations of the test masses depends on the softness of the laminar suspensions and on the uniform distribution of mass around the spin axis .",
    "soft suspensions and a good balancing of the rotor provide long natural periods for differential oscillations of the test masses relative to each other , giving rise to larger relative displacements between the two , and in turn to stronger output voltage signals .",
    "tuning of the natural differential period @xmath44 of the test cylinders is made possible by changing a moment - arm in the beam balance .",
    "this is accomplished by moving a small solid ring mounted at the lower end of the balance ( coupling ) arm . moving this ring vertically along the arm , in the @xmath17 direction",
    ", displaces the center - of - mass of the balance arm from its suspension point by a quantity @xmath45 . if @xmath46 the center - of - mass of the balance arm is coincident with its suspension point .",
    "@xmath45 can be adjusted to be either slightly positive or negative , resulting in a longer or shorter @xmath44 . however",
    ", there s a maximum positive value that @xmath45 can assume before the system becomes unstable ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqtdiff ] ) below ) .",
    "asymmetric distribution of mass of the rotor in the horizontal plane , resulting in a non - zero inclination of the coupling arm in the rotating reference frame , may also be corrected by two small masses mounted inside the coupling arm itself , one of which is movable in the x direction and the other in the y.    the tilt of the spin axis with respect to the non rotating laboratory frame is controlled by three micrometer screws which support the plate on which the rotor shaft is mounted .",
    "in addition the tilt can be finely adjusted using piezoelectric actuators ( p ) attached to the tips of the micrometer screws ( see fig .  [ fig : gggscheme ] ) .    _",
    "( ii ) _ as to the dmd system , a non - zero off - centering of the capacitor plates @xmath21 located in between the test cylinders @xmath1measured by the ratio @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the nominal gap between the inner ( outer ) mass and any one of the capacitance plates@xmath1 would make a common mode displacement @xmath50 of the test masses to produce a differential output signal in addition to that produced by a real differential displacement @xmath51 . the larger this off - centering , the larger the fraction of common mode displacement which is turned into a ` fake ' differential signal , i.e. which contributes to the total unbalance @xmath52 of the capacitance bridge  @xcite ( gg phase a report , sec .",
    "2.1.3 ) from the original capacitance value @xmath53 : @xmath54      signal modulation in testing the equivalence principle has been first proposed in  @xcite in order to improve the etvs experiments . by referring to the sun rather than the earth as the source mass of the gravitational field ,",
    "the diurnal rotation of the earth itself on which the test masses are suspended provides a @xmath5-hr modulation with no need to rotate the experimental apparatus , an operation which gives rise to relevant disturbances in such small force experiments . however , higher modulation frequencies are desirable in order to reduce @xmath13 noise , and in fact excellent results have been obtained by  @xcite with torsion balances placed on a turntable rotating faster than the earth . in ggg we try to spin the test masses much faster , at frequencies ( typically a few hz ) higher than the natural frequencies @xmath55 of the system , a condition known as _ supercritical rotation_.    the ggg apparatus has @xmath27 natural frequencies .",
    "the differential frequency @xmath56 , of the oscillations of the test bodies relative to one another , and two common mode frequencies , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , of both test masses together . in the ggg setting reported here their values are : @xmath59 hz , @xmath60 hz , @xmath61 hz .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that in supercritical rotation the masses are able to self - center and greatly reduce the original offsets of their centers of mass with respect to their own rotation axes .",
    "any initial offset , which inevitably results from construction and mounting errors , is in fact reduced by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "such self - centering is a very essential requirement when using fast rotating macroscopic test bodies for the purpose of detecting the effects of extremely small forces between them .",
    "it is also well known that in supercritical rotation , dissipation in the system gives rise to destabilizing _",
    "whirl _ motions at frequencies @xmath63 equal ( or close ) to the natural frequencies of the system , whose amplitude increases with time at a rate @xmath64 scaling as the whirl frequency @xmath63 and the inverse of the quality factor @xmath65 at the spin frequency @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "whirls can be stabilized by passive and active methods .",
    "passive stabilization is typically used in engineering applications of supercritical rotors , but it produces too large disturbances for our purposes .",
    "we have used a passive damper in the past only to stabilize the rotor during resonance crossing ( see  @xcite , sec .",

    "this is easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqeccola ] ) after substituting @xmath297 with @xmath298 and imposing @xmath294 .",
    "we plan to exploit this property in order to obtain better self - centering , though it needs further investigation in the actual ggg rotor .",
    "we can consider a plot similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : selfcentering2 ] in the ggg case with two concentric cylinders and a coupling arm , where there are @xmath27 natural frequencies ( one differential and two common mode ) .",
    "it happens that the common mode behavior is similar to that of the one - cylinder case ( shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfcentering2 ] ) ; namely , for each common mode frequency there is a resonance peak and a minimum peak . instead ,",
    "the differential frequency behavior is similar to that of a point mass ( shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfcentering2 ] ) .",
    "this latter fact is because in the differential mode the coupling arm oscillates and the cylinders centers of mass move in the horizontal plane with opposite phase , while @xmath299 ; under these conditions , their moment of inertia is irrelevant in determining the dynamics , which therefore is very much alike the case of a point mass . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath281 of the ggg rotor for intermediate values of the spin frequency is characterized by : one peak at low frequency , in correspondence to the differential mode , and two peaks and two minima in correspondence to the common modes . instead , in the limit of very low and very high spin frequencies",
    ", it has a behavior similar to that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfcentering2 ] , depending on the values and directions assumed for the initial offsets of the three bodies .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the best possible centering of the test cylinders in the ggg rotor , one can either spin at a frequency close to the minima of the common modes , or above both of them , in such a condition that the two cylinders are better centered on their own rotation axes than both of them are , together , in common mode .",
    "self - centering on the rotation axes is very important in order to reduce rotation noise , because we are dealing with rapidly spinning macroscopic bodies and aiming at measuring extremely small effects .",
    "the issue therefore needs careful investigation , and to this end realistic numerical simulations of the apparatus are an essential tool .    finally , concerning the use of supercritical rotors for ep testing , it is worth mentioning a frequently asked question : would a relative displacement of the test bodies caused by an external force @xmath16such as that resulting from an ep violation@xmath16 be reduced by self - centering in supercritical rotation as it happens for the original offset @xmath198 ?",
    "the answer is  no \" , because the offset vector is fixed in the rotating frame of the system , while an external force gives rise to a displacement of the equilibrium position of the bodies in the non - rotating reference frame . in the presence of such a force",
    ", whirl motion will take place around the displaced position of equilibrium .",
    "a numerical simulation , showing this important feature is reported and discussed in  @xcite , pla paper , p. 176 .",

    "<S> recent theoretical work suggests that violation of the equivalence principle might be revealed in a measurement of the fractional differential acceleration @xmath0 between two test bodies @xmath1of different composition , falling in the gravitational field of a source mass@xmath1 if the measurement is made to the level of @xmath2 or better . </S>",
    "<S> this being within the reach of ground based experiments , gives them a new impetus . </S>",
    "<S> however , while slowly rotating torsion balances in ground laboratories are close to reaching this level , only an experiment performed in low orbit around the earth is likely to provide a much better accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> we report on the progress made with the `` galileo galilei on the ground '' ( ggg ) experiment , which aims to compete with torsion balances using an instrument design also capable of being converted into a much higher sensitivity space test .    in the present and following paper ( part i and part ii ) , we demonstrate that the dynamical response of the ggg differential accelerometer set into supercritical rotation @xmath1 in particular its normal modes ( part i ) and rejection of common mode effects ( part ii)@xmath1 can be predicted by means of a simple but effective model that embodies all the relevant physics . </S>",
    "<S> analytical solutions are obtained under special limits , which provide the theoretical understanding . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation environment is set up , obtaining quantitative agreement with the available experimental data on the frequencies of the normal modes , and on the whirling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this is a needed and reliable tool for controlling and separating perturbative effects from the expected signal , as well as for planning the optimization of the apparatus . </S>"
