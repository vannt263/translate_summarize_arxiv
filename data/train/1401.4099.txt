    "the form factor describing the @xmath12 vertex ( also called the pion transition form factor , @xmath13tff ) has played an important role in establishing qcd as the dynamical theory of strong interactions @xcite and the role of the anomaly for the gauge theory @xcite . in the chiral limit , the prediction for this vertex @xcite has been beautifully confirmed by the measured rate of @xmath14 decays @xcite .",
    "the isospin related weak vertex @xmath15 has also been proven to obey the chiral limit prediction @xcite from measurements of the vector form factor in radiative weak decays of pions @xcite . on the other hand , the qcd predictions for very large photon virtualities",
    "@xcite seem to be at odds with recent measurements at @xmath16 factories experiments @xcite .",
    "these predictions for the @xmath13tff in the infrared and ultraviolet limits have traditionally provided a guide to built the vertex in the intermediate energy region , where the effects of hadronic degrees of freedom play a prominent role .",

    ", the evaluation of the hadronic light - by - light ( hlbl ) scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( @xmath17 ) is dominated by the pion exchange diagrams which require the @xmath18 vertex with all the particles off their mass - shells ( see @xcite and references therein   are introduced in more detail in section [ lbl ] . ] ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that the hadronic contributions to the muon @xmath7 provide the main source of current theoretical uncertainties in the standard theory prediction for this observable  , which exhibits a pertinacious discrepancy at the three sigma level between the standard theory prediction and the bnl measurement @xcite .",
    "this disagreement attracts more attention given the lack of new physics signals at the lhc and , together with the forthcoming experiments at fermilab and j - parc @xcite aiming to improve the current uncertainty of @xmath17 by a factor four , pushes the theoretical community to try to reduce the corresponding theoretical error of @xmath17 ( which matches the present experimental accuracy ) . along these lines , decreasing the error of the hadronic vacuum polarization and hlbl scattering contributions to @xmath17 turns out to be the main target .    in this paper",
    "we use the present experimental information on the related @xmath19 form factor at large photon virtualities to constrain the behavior of the transition form factor in the resonance region .",
    "the @xmath3 interaction has been probed in @xmath20 production in electron - positron collisions at energies ranging from threshold up to the @xmath21 center of mass energies @xcite .",
    "the isospin related vertex , @xmath22 , has been measured from threshold up to the tau lepton mass in the @xmath23 decays @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to constraint the short - distance behavior of this form factor @xcite relied on theoretical constraints based on the asymptotic behavior predicted by qcd on the basis of the bjl theorem @xcite . here",

    "the remaining free parameters involved in the form factor are fixed from a fit to experimental data for photon virtualities up the @xmath5 gev region .    after getting rid of the form factor in the full energy regime covered by current experimental data ,",

    "conversely , its measurement , which seems to be at the reach of present and forthcoming @xmath31 colliders , would provide a valuable information on the @xmath13tff and an unambiguous test of the @xmath24 prediction . as a natural use of our @xmath32 form factor",

    "their comparison with the data validates our approach and we are thus able to evaluate the corresponding contributions to the hlbl scattering muon anomaly . in this way , we obtain the contribution of the three lightest pseudoscalars to the hlbl scattering @xmath7 .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ theory ] we explain our theoretical setting , namely @xmath24 , and introduce the relevant pieces of the lagrangian that will be employed throughout .",
    "next , in section [ omegapigammaff ] we present the @xmath24 results for the @xmath34 form factor and discuss the qcd short - distance constraints that apply to the involved couplings in section [ sd rct ] . in section [ data_omega ]",
    "we confront this form factor to the available data below @xmath5 gev obtained from @xmath31 collisions and @xmath35 decays , ( section [ data_omega_lowe ] ) and find that three multiplets of resonances are required to obtain good accuracy fits to data , in agreement with ref .",
    "our best fit results yield small violations of the high - energy constraints .",
    "the observation that our best fit form factor does not show a sizable disagreement with data in the charmonium region motivates us to study the possible extension of our description to higher energies in section [ data_omega_highe ] .",
    "we find that , although this is possible up to the @xmath36 region , the @xmath24 description can not be extended up to larger energies even including an infinite tower of resonances per quantum number , as predicted by large-@xmath37 arguments @xcite .",

    "we turn to the @xmath13tff , whose derivation within @xmath24 is recalled in section [ piggff ] , where formulae are given both for the virtual and real pion cases .",
    "this is done by considering , in addition to the pseudo - goldstone bosons , the lightest multiplet of pseudoscalar and vector resonances , a choice which is motivated by the study of consistent short - distance constraints in the odd - intrinsic parity resonance chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "noteworthy , all involved couplings are predicted in the case with a real pion , while only one of them is not in the virtual pion case and needs to be fixed phenomenologically .",
    "data on the @xmath13tff is analyzed in section [ analysis pig*g ] ; a good agreement with data is found with tiny violations of the asymptotic qcd constraints . in section",
    "[ probe of pig*g * ] we propose the study of a new observable involving the @xmath13tff , namely the @xmath41 cross - section and di - muon invariant mass distribution , and discuss the experimental signatures and the feasibility of these measurements at present and near future facilities .",
    "this reaction can provide complementary information for the @xmath13tff of timelike photons from its threshold up to bottomonium energy scales .",
    "as an application of these analyses we evaluate in section [ lbl ] the dominant pion exchange contribution to the hlbl piece of @xmath17 and discuss our result confronting it to other predictions in the literature .",
    "we also comment on the assumption of considering the pion pole contribution instead of the whole pion exchange contribution , which underestimates the result way beyond the quoted errors .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath42 exchange contributions to @xmath43 can also be computed using our results for the @xmath13tff , which is done in section [ etaetap ] . in this way",
    "we come up with an evaluation of the leading pseudoscalar exchange contributions to @xmath43 . finally , we summarize our findings and present and outlook on @xmath43 in section [ conclusions ] . an appendix giving relevant formulae for the evaluation of @xmath44 in sections",
    "[ lbl ] and [ etaetap ] completes our present work .",
    "the @xmath3 form factor and the @xmath13tff can not be derived analytically from first principles since they span diverse energy regions , some of them belonging to the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "this quantum field theory of the strong interactions predicts the behaviours of these form factors at the two extremes of the energy region . on the one hand , the approximate chiral symmetry of light - flavoured qcd yields definite corroborated predictions on the very low energy end . on the other side ,",
    "perturbative qcd allows to derive the asymptotic behaviour of the form factors under study .",
    "the resonance chiral lagrangians are thought as a useful tool to interpolate between these two known behaviours .",
    "the effective field theory dual to qcd at low energies is chiral perturbation theory @xcite ( @xmath45 ) , which is based on an expansion in powers of the momenta and/or masses of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons ( which have status of pseudo - goldstone bosons of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown ) over the chiral symmetry breaking scale , of order @xmath46 gev . around this typical hadronic scale ,",
    "the chiral expansion will no longer be convergent .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 ceases to be applicable much earlier , at @xmath47 [ with @xmath48 the mass of the @xmath49 meson ] , where new degrees of freedom corresponding to the lightest light - flavoured resonances become active .",
    "when these resonances are introduced as dynamical fields in the action of the theory the inverse of the number of colours of the @xmath50 gauge group , @xmath51 @xcite , becomes a useful expansion parameter @xcite for a perturbative approach to the meson resonance dynamics . at leading order ( lo ) in this expansion",
    "the spectrum of the theory includes infinite ( excited ) copies of every meson with definite quantum numbers and these states are free and stable .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections explain the ( rather wide ) widths of ( many ) mesons and their decays by tree - level contact interactions described by an effective lagrangian .",
    "a realization of these ideas is provided by the resonance chiral theory @xcite , @xmath24 , which is built requiring chiral symmetry for the pseudo - goldstone bosons ( spontaneously broken by the quark condensate and explicitly by the small light quark masses ) , unitary symmetry for the resonance multiplets and the discrete symmetries of the qcd lagrangian , without any dynamical assumption on the role of any type of resonances in the theory . in this respect ,",
    "the well - known notion of vector meson dominance @xcite emerges as a dynamical result @xcite and not as a priori assumption .",
    "the coefficients of the resonance chiral lagrangians are not restricted by this procedure and all of them are free parameters until compatibility with qcd short - distance information is required .",
    "the matching of the @xmath24 green functions and associated form factors to the @xmath50 expressions for these quantities yields restrictions among the resonance couplings that ensure a right asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath24 expressions and increase the predictability of the theory . within the antisymmetric tensor formalism",
    ", it has been shown that a consistent set of short - distance @xmath50 constraints on the @xmath24 even- and odd - intrinsic parity couplings can be found including only the lightest multiplet of resonances with given quantum numbers @xcite   green function @xcite . ] . in this way",
    ", the minimal hadronic ansatz @xcite corresponding to including as many resonance multiplets as needed to achieve consistent high - energy constraints on the resonance couplings reduces to the single resonance approximation .",
    "the discussion of the asymptotic qcd constraints on the @xmath24 couplings relevant for this work can be found in section [ sd rct ] .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that there is no limitation in @xmath24 with respect to the number of meson multiplets to be included in the theory . as a guiding principle",
    ", the fact that the low - energy dynamics is mostly determined by the lightest states suggests that it is a sound approximation to include only those degrees of freedom that can be excited in the considered process , which is the basis of the effective field theory approach .",
    "the addition of more resonance multiplets will increase the number of participating couplings , reduce the predictability of the theory and modify the short - distance constraints obtained in the single resonance approximation .",
    "however , when data are precise enough to probe the physics of the excited resonances , these should be added as active fields to the action , as suggested by the @xmath52 limit .",

    "<S> the description of the @xmath0 form factors ( @xmath1 stands for vector particles and @xmath2 for a pseudoscalar meson ) for different particles virtualities remains a challenge for the theory of strong interactions . while their chiral limit is well understood , recent measurements of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 form factors at high photon virtualities seem to depart from the simplest scaling behavior suggested by qcd . here </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to describe them in their whole measured energy regimes within the resonance chiral theory , a framework which naturally incorporates the chiral limit constraints and extends to higher energies by including the resonances as active fields .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we obtained an accurate description of the data up to @xmath5 gev on the former form factor by including three multiplets of vector resonances . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with measurements of the latter was possible even in the single resonance approximation , although we propose to measure the @xmath6 cross - section and di - muon invariant mass distribution to better characterize this form factor . </S>",
    "<S> we have then evaluated the pion exchange contribution to the muon @xmath7 obtaining @xmath8 with an accurate determination of the errors . </S>",
    "<S> we have also recalled that approximating the whole pion exchange by the pion pole contribution underestimates the corresponding result for the anomaly ( by @xmath9 ) . based on these results , </S>",
    "<S> we have predicted the @xmath10 transition form factors obtaining good agreement with data and obtained their respective contributions to the muon anomaly . in this way , the contribution of the three lightest pseudoscalars to it yields @xmath11 , in agreement with previous evaluations but with smaller error .    </S>"
