    "in a 1967 study on social networks  @xcite , stanley milgram found that on average a randomly chosen person in the midwest usa could be connected to a target person in massachusetts through a string of first - name acquaintances in only six steps .",
    "while this notion of `` six degrees of separation '' rapidly acquired folkloric status in popular culture  @xcite , the structure of the underlying networks remained largely unexplored until recently . the `` smallness '' was attributed to the logarithmic scaling with graph size of distances between nodes on random graphs  @xcite .",
    "actual social networks are far from random , however . today , social and other networks",
    "are frequently described as consisting of mutually - interconnected local groups together with some far - flung ties .",
    "interest in the properties of such partially - ordered networks was sparked by the work of watts and strogatz  @xcite , who in 1998 introduced and studied numerically a  small - world \" network model in which a controlled degree of disorder is introduced into initially ordered graphs by randomly rewiring some fraction of their links .",

    "watts and strogatz s observation that even a small degree of randomness changes the scaling of the minimum graph distance between randomly - chosen nodes , @xmath0 , with the total number of nodes , @xmath1 , from the linear behavior of ordered graphs to the logarithmic scaling associated with random graphs , provoked a flurry of interest .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath0 , has been obtained by renormalization - group  @xcite and mean - field analysis  @xcite . in particular , moukarzel  @xcite showed that for systems of size @xmath2 on a @xmath3-dimensional underlying lattice there is a crossover length @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the density of shortcuts , such that on a scale @xmath6 , @xmath7 scales as @xmath8 , whereas on larger scales @xmath9 .",
    "today , the term  small - world \" has come to describe any system displaying a combination of strong local clustering with a small graph diameter .",
    "mathias and gopal  @xcite have shown that optimization of a regular graph for high connectivity and low total bond length gives rise to small - world behavior .",
    "interestingly , the optimized graphs are distinguished by the generation of a relatively small number of highly - connected  hub \" vertices , rather than a random distribution of long - range links as in the watts  strogatz model .",
    "hub - dominated networks are also generated by a model for a dynamically expanding graph proposed by albert and barabsi  @xcite to explain the scale - free ( i.e. power - law ) distribution in vertex connectivity common to many real - world networks , such as the world - wide web and the science citation database . for scale free networks , it has been shown  @xcite , that the network is even smaller than small world networks , i.e. , has a sub - logarithmic average distance between nodes .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite discerned two other classes of behavior in small - world networks in addition to scale - free graphs , characterized by truncated power - law and rapidly - decaying connectivities respectively , and proposed how such behavior can arise due to constraints placed on the albert - barabsi model .",
    "in addition to work on the properties of small - world networks themselves , recent attention has focused on the behavior of physical systems defined on small - world graphs , including ising models  @xcite , neural networks  @xcite , and random walks  @xcite .",
    "there has also been work on models of disease epidemics using site and bond percolation defined on small - world graphs ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the wide ranging interest and implications of small world networks have also led to a need for precise understanding and , where possible , exact solutions of the fundamental properties of these networks . in this paper",
    "we focus on identifying unusual properties that arise in the case of small world networks on an underlying one dimensional lattice .",
    "we provide exact solutions for a generalized model and study the behavior in the limit of few long range links  a limit we find is very sensitive to the manner in which it is obtained",
    ". we also point to practical implications for securing connectivity in one dimensional transportation and communication chains , showing how failure of some local links is overcome by the existence of long range links .",
    "percolation is quite sensitive to the geometry of the underlying lattice .",
    "one dimensional lattices are generally inappropriate for representing the graph underlying social networks , however , they may be appropriate in specific contexts .",
    "consider , for instance , a chain of islands , cities , or nodes in an ad hoc or wired network situated in a nearly linear formation , say along a road .",
    "such a configuration is extremely sensitive to breakdown , if even a small number of the links connecting the nodes is removed .",
    "this follows from the well known result that one dimensional systems only percolate in the limit of zero failure rate . to fortify the structure of such a network",
    ", random long range links may be added that can backup missing short range bonds . for road transportation",
    "long range bonds may be added by airlines or boat lines , for wired communications long range bonds might be provided by microwave or satellite communication links . the important question : `` how many long range links are needed to replace an ( expected ) number of short range failed links ? '' is addressed in this manuscript .    for a simple ring structure",
    "it will be shown that for any constant ratio of long range bonds added to replace removed short range bonds , some nodes remain isolated from the rest . however ,",
    "if only a quarter of the number of the failed short range bonds exist as long range shortcuts the chain is not broken  a giant connected component exists comprising a constant fraction of the nodes .",
    "as an example , this shows how to achieve reliable communication in a game of `` telephone . ''",
    "in the game , one person tells a second person something , the second tells a third , and so on down a chain . for a long chain , and even a reasonably short chain , errors garble the communication .",
    "our results show that if there are also long range links of communication along the chain , comprising a quarter of the short range links , the random errors that are formed do not cause errors in the answer .",
    "we note the difference in behavior of short range and long range fortifying links .",
    "short range fortification in a @xmath10-ring architecture , in which each node is connected to its @xmath11 nearest neighbors leads to an exponentially decreasing probability of disconnection in @xmath10 .",
    "still , in the limit of long enough chains , a fixed @xmath10 implies that a chain always breaks .",
    "moreover , this method of reinforcement is expensive in the number of links needed .",
    "the probability of a node being disconnected from all nodes in one direction is @xmath12 .",
    "a lower bound on the probability of disconnecting the ring at @xmath13 locations can thus be approximated by @xmath14 . for any constant @xmath5 and any @xmath13 , as large as desired",
    ", keeping this probability vanishingly small requires at least @xmath15 .",
    "thus , resiliency to random failure requires at least @xmath16 bonds ( corresponding to the known collapse of the one dimensional percolation ) , whereas , as will be seen , the number of long range links needed is linear in @xmath1 ( and actually lower than @xmath1 ) .",
    "it should be noted however , that for random long range bonds @xmath16 bonds are still needed to ensure that all nodes are connected  @xcite .    the best practical solution may be to combine short range and long range reinforcement .",
    "we find that for @xmath17 , and small removal rates of the short range bonds , the network will remain connected ( up to a statistically insignificant fraction of the nodes ) for any constant ratio of added long - range bonds .",
    "thus , the addition of relatively few random long - range bonds can ensure percolation and global connectivity .",
    "recent studies of percolation on small world networks  @xcite have antecedents in the study of bond - percolation  @xcite whose methodology is the basis of our analysis . small - world - type graphs , with their mixture of ordered local and random long - range bonds , present the statistical physicist with an interesting percolation model .",
    "it turns out that the construction of the original watts ",
    "strogatz ( ws ) model  in which shortcuts are created by reconnecting only one end of an original local bond  renders it analytically hard to treat , due to the correlations it introduces between the distribution of local and long - range bonds .",
    "for this reason , most analytical work is done using a variant of the model in which long - range bonds are added between randomly chosen pairs of sites .",
    "this change does not affect the small - world behavior of the resulting graphs , but makes them far easier to treat analytically ; we will refer to both the original and the variant as ws models .",
    "figure  [ example]c gives an example of a variant ws graph .",
    "newman and watts  @xcite have performed both analytical and numerical analysis of site percolation on such a model with a local bond coordination number @xmath10 and a density @xmath18 of shortcuts added per local bond ; no local bonds were removed .",
    "their results , suggesting site - percolation on ws graphs is similar to that on random graphs , were confirmed by more rigorous work on the same system by moore and newman  @xcite .",
    "in addition to demonstrating that site percolation on small - world networks is in the same universality class as random graphs ( i.e. mean - field ) , moore and newman presented a formal solution to the bond percolation problem with independent probabilities of local and long - range bonds .",
    "they were able to solve this for @xmath19 and @xmath20 to show that the percolation transition in such systems also displays mean - field behavior .",
    "newman and moore s results on bond percolation in small - world systems had in fact been anticipated some 17 years earlier by kaufman and kardar  @xcite , who solved the bond percolation problem on what would now be regarded as a @xmath19 ws model with general nearest - neighbor and long - range bond probabilities @xmath21 respectively . in section  [ review ] of this paper",
    "we present a review of kardar and kaufman s method and their results describing the percolation transition . in section",
    "[ main ] we then use the formalism developed in ref",
    ".  @xcite to consider the critical percolation behavior of a standard ws graph by imposing the relation @xmath22 , corresponding to one long - range bond being added to the system for every local bond removed .",

    "we then solve the problem for a generalized graph in which we allow the number of long - range bonds added for every short - range bond removed to vary continuously .",

    "there will thus be a percolation transition at the point @xmath163 , again governed by mean - field exponents .",
    "this result provides enough information to draw some conclusions about the behavior of generalized ws graphs in higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , in the one - dimensional case it was the intersection of small - world trajectories with the critical point at @xmath95 that gave rise to all the interesting behavior as @xmath107 . in higher dimensions",
    ", however , small - world trajectories as defined in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) do not encounter any critical points as @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we would not expect any critical behavior other than a mean - field transition should they pass through the transition line ( in the @xmath164 space ) at some point other than the origin .",
    "we have examined the percolation properties of a class of ws graphs generalized by allowing the proportion of long - range and short - range bonds to vary with a parameter @xmath13 according to @xmath165 .",
    "such graphs then lie along  small - world \" trajectories parameterized by @xmath13 and @xmath5 in the space of graphs with general @xmath21 .",
    "previous solutions of bond percolation on graphs with general @xmath21 have been shown to give results in the same class as random graphs  @xcite , with the transition between the percolating and non - percolating phase controlled by mean - field exponents @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath105 .",
    "an interesting aspect of the the original watts  strogatz model , and its generalization presented here is the interplay between the deleted short - range links and the added shortcuts . in this paper",
    "we have discussed several aspects of this interplay , including the discontinuous jump between the two _ percolating _ phases at @xmath168 and the critical behavior near the percolation phase transition point .",
    "we have presented an analytical solution of generalized ws graphs , valid for @xmath169 , and a numerical solution for the standard ( @xmath83 ) ws graph , which together show that the critical behavior of such networks in the @xmath107 limit falls into one of three regimes of behavior depending upon the value of @xmath13 . moreover , in none of these regimes is the transition described by standard mean - field .",
    "trajectories for which @xmath127 display a transition between two percolating phases in which the percolation probability , @xmath66 , jumps discontinuously from a finite value to unity at the transition point while the mean finite - cluster size , @xmath45 , diverges .",
    "the critical exponents associated with the transition are @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "trajectories with @xmath170 and @xmath84 both display a percolation transition with a @xmath66 jumping discontinuously from 0 to 1 and critical exponents @xmath171  @xcite and @xmath104 ; however they are differentiated by the behavior of @xmath45 , which diverges with exponent @xmath105 for @xmath170 and @xmath152 for @xmath84 .",
    "we have further proposed that all three regimes of behavior can be unified within a single scaling form for the cluster - size generating function , @xmath93 , that is valid in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath95 . according to this proposal",
    ", the failure of the critical exponents for @xmath172 to satisfy the identity @xmath173 can be related to asymptotic zeroes of the scaling function .",
    "we have also considered the percolative behavior of generalized ws graphs on higher - dimensional lattices .",
    "while no exact solution exists , general considerations of the form of the phase diagram for systems with general @xmath174 indicate that there should not be any critical behavior along small  world trajectories .    to conclude",
    ", we note that , as far as we are aware , studies of the dependence of the graph diameter , @xmath0 , on the long - range bond probability @xmath5 in ws graphs have so far focused exclusively on the @xmath83 case .",
    "however , our analysis of bond percolation in generalized ws graphs has shown that varying @xmath13 can have important consequences in case of a 1-dimensional underlying lattice .",
    "in particular , according to the form of our scaling function , in the @xmath94 limit it is the quantity @xmath175 that is the physically important parameter in percolation .",
    "an interesting question therefore arises as to whether the graph diameter @xmath176 has a corresponding dependence on @xmath13 , and in particular whether the value @xmath84 has a physical significance beyond the percolation behavior presented here .",
    "it should be noted that the original ws model has been extended mainly to @xmath10-rings , rings where each node is connected to its @xmath10 nearest neighbors on each side ( for a total of @xmath11 nearest neighbors bonds per site ) . while this model is also one dimensional , and does not percolate without long - range bonds ( unless @xmath177 ) , the singular behavior as @xmath178 could well be different from the case @xmath19 . for a @xmath10-ring , a lower bound on the asymptotic probability that a node does not belong to a long `` super - node '' extending to its left behaves as @xmath179 . using eq .",
    "( [ y_p ] ) with @xmath180 replacing @xmath87 , and with the approximation @xmath181 , one obtains that for @xmath17 , @xmath182 for @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , the behavior near the fully connected ring state is analytic in contrast to the singly connected ring no jump discontinuity exists .",
    "m.  k. is supported by nsf grant dmr-04 - 26677 .",
    "in this appendix we develop a different approach to studying the percolation transition in small world networks .",
    "we use the generating function formalism , stressing the topological , rather than thermodynamic structure of the network .",
    "the percolation process can be perceived as consisting of two stages . in the first stage",
    "short range links are removed from the network with probability @xmath184 .",
    "the remaining network consists of isolated islands of varying sizes .",
    "we will term a group of nodes connected by a chain of short - range links a `` super - node . ''",
    "this construction can be viewed as a renormalization of the network , where each super - node is a node in the new network , having weight proportional to its original size . in the second stage",
    "long - range links are added to the network , and we study the connectivity between super - nodes through these long - range links . the probability , @xmath185 , of a node to belong to a super - node of size",
    "@xmath3 is the number of possible consecutive sets of size @xmath3 including this node ( which is just @xmath3 ) times the probability of the @xmath186 links between these @xmath3 nodes to be intact , and the two links leading to nodes neighboring this super - node to be removed .",
    "therefore , @xmath187 and the generating function for the super - node size is @xmath188    consider now the distribution of the number of long range links emanating from a super - node of size @xmath3 , since there are @xmath189 edges having @xmath190 ends ( links ) randomly distributed on the ring , we expect a poisson distribution of the links with mean @xmath191 per node , or @xmath192 per super - node",
    ". therefore the probability of having @xmath10 links from a super - node is @xmath193 and the joint generating function for super - node size and degree is @xmath194    to calculate the distribution of component sizes obtained by following a link , one should notice that the probability of reaching each node by following a long range link is the same .",
    "therefore , the probability of reaching a super - node is proportional to its size and similar to the probability that a node belongs to a super - node of size @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the distribution of cluster sizes reached by following a link ( which is similar to the distribution of cluster sizes in general due to the poisson distribution ) is given by the self consistent equation @xmath195 from this self - consistency condition all cluster and percolation properties can be obtained . in particular , when finding the solution of the equation @xmath196 if @xmath197 there exists no giant component , while for @xmath198 a giant component exists .",
    "the size of the giant component is determined to be @xmath199 . as discussed before ,",
    "the behavior as @xmath183 , with @xmath22 is special : as this limit is approached , @xmath200 , with a discontinuous jump to @xmath201 for @xmath177 and @xmath202  !",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ self_con ] ) in powers of @xmath203 for @xmath204 and @xmath205 gives the phase transition behavior for the model .",
    "one obtains , @xmath206 leading to the critical percolation threshold at @xmath207 near the threshold it can be seen that the quadratic term in @xmath203 will always exist unless @xmath183 or @xmath208 . for a generalized @xmath13",
    "the behavior depends on the expansion of the linear terms in @xmath203 as a function of the deviation from the critical point .",
    "furthermore , for the original ws model with @xmath209 it is easily seen that the whole @xmath210 range is within the percolating regime .        for more information .",
