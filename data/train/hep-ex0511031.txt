    "the @xmath5(1020 ) radiative decays to f@xmath10(980 ) and a@xmath10(980 ) play an important role in the investigation of the controversial structure of the lighter scalar mesons  @xcite . at kloe",
    ", we detect the f@xmath10 through its decay to @xmath11 via the decay chain @xmath12 .",
    "kloe has already published studies on @xmath5 decays to f@xmath13 and a@xmath13 looking for the final states @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite , respectively . on the contrary ,",
    "the decay chain @xmath16 is kinematically suppressed , and has not been observed yet . in this paper",
    "we present a study of the f@xmath10 decay to @xmath0 , based on an integrated luminosity of 350 pb@xmath17 collected at the collider da@xmath18ne during the years 2001 and 2002 , at a centre of mass energy @xmath4 around the @xmath5 mass @xmath19 within @xmath20 mev ( `` on - peak '' data ) .",
    "the only previous search for this decay has been published by the cmd-2 collaboration  @xcite , mainly based on an energy scan around the @xmath5 mass peak .",
    "we look for f@xmath21 decays in events @xmath22 . only a small fraction of the @xmath23 events originates from the radiative decay @xmath24f@xmath13 with f@xmath21 .",
    "the main contribution is given by @xmath22 events with a photon from initial state ( isr ) or final state ( fsr ) radiation .",
    "the amplitude of each contribution is characterised by a different spectrum of the @xmath0 invariant mass @xmath25 , and of the photon polar angle @xmath26 measured with respect to the beam axis . in particular",
    ", the isr is the dominant contribution for small photon polar angles , allowing to extract the @xmath27 cross - section below the @xmath5 mass with the so called radiative return method @xcite ; at large values of @xmath26 the isr contribution is strongly reduced , so that the other processes can be observed in this region only .",
    "a smaller contribution comes from the decay @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( we call it @xmath30 term in the following ) .",
    "it contributes in the low mass region , @xmath31 , with total branching ratio br(@xmath28)@xmath32 br(@xmath33)@xmath34 . finally ,",
    "the possibility to observe the decay chain @xmath24f@xmath10(600)@xmath35 is considered .",
    "the @xmath0 pair has different quantum numbers whether it is produced through fsr and f@xmath10 decay or isr : j@xmath36=0@xmath37 in the former case , and j@xmath36=1@xmath38 in the latter .",
    "a sizeable interference term between fsr and f@xmath10 decay is expected in the @xmath25 spectrum . on the other hand any interference term between two amplitudes of opposite charge conjugation",
    "gives rise to @xmath39-odd terms that change sign by the interchange of the two pions .",
    "therefore , the interference between isr and fsr or f@xmath10 decay , results in a null contribution in the @xmath25 spectrum for symmetric cuts on @xmath26 and @xmath40 , and in a sizable forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath41 , defined as : + @xmath42 where the angle @xmath43 is defined with respect to the direction of the incoming electron beam .",
    "da@xmath18ne is an @xmath44-collider with a peak luminosity of about 10@xmath45@xmath46s@xmath17 at a centre of mass energy @xmath47 gev .",
    "the beams collide with a crossing angle of @xmath48 - 0.025 rad .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large - volume cylindrical drift chamber  @xcite ( 3.3  m length and 2  m radius ) , operated with a 90% helium-10% isobutane gas mixture , surrounded by a sampling calorimeter  @xcite made of lead and scintillating fibres providing a solid angle coverage of 98% .",
    "the tracking chamber and the calorimeter are surrounded by a superconducting coil that produces a solenoidal field @xmath49=0.52",
    "t. the drift chamber has a momentum resolution of @xmath50 0.4% .",
    "photon energies and arrival times are measured by the calorimeter with resolutions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ps .",
    "the trigger  @xcite is based on the detection of at least two energy deposits in the calorimeter above a threshold that ranges between 50 and 150  mev .",
    "the trigger includes a cosmic ray veto based on large energy deposits in the outermost calorimeter layers .",
    "we select @xmath23 events by requiring a reconstructed vertex close to the interaction region with two tracks of opposite charge , emitted with polar angles above @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we suppress the isr component by requiring the polar angle of the total missing momentum to be larger than @xmath53 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "both tracks are extrapolated to the calorimeter .",
    "a likelihood variable , based on the time of flight and on the shower profile ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is used to select pions .",
    "a cut on this variable reduces the background due to @xmath55 events to a negligible level . +",
    "in order to remove @xmath56 and @xmath57 events , we define the track mass variable @xmath58 as the solution of the equation : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the momenta of the two tracks , and where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the @xmath5 energy and momentum , respectively .",
    "these are evaluated run by run using samples of bhabha scattering events .",
    "( [ trackmass ] ) is verified by events with two particles of mass @xmath58 and a third particle with null mass .",
    "@xmath58 is required to be equal to the pion mass within @xmath6410 mev . to reduce the residual @xmath56 contamination and to remove badly reconstructed @xmath27 events with soft",
    "photon emitted , we require a calorimeter cluster matching the missing energy and momentum . the cluster is required to be non associated to tracks , to have an energy @xmath65 , and to have a time compatible with a photon coming from the interaction vertex , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the cluster time , @xmath68 is the flight distance , and @xmath69 is the time resolution for photons of energy @xmath70 .",
    "the requirement @xmath65 translates in an effective cut @xmath71 .",
    "finally , the angle @xmath72 between the missing momentum and the photon direction derived from the cluster position , has to be below 0.03+@xmath73  rad .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath72 cut on @xmath70 reflects that of the cluster position resolution on the photon energy .",
    "+ we select 6.7@xmath74 events .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath11 invariant mass @xmath25 for these events and the forward - backward asymmetry dependence on @xmath25 are shown in fig .",
    "we observe a small bump in the @xmath25 spectrum in the region where the f@xmath10(980 ) is expected to be .",
    "a signal is observed also as a dip in the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath75 , for the same values of @xmath25 .",
    "+    total efficiency and residual background distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ effic ] , as evaluated by monte carlo with corrections based on data control samples @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the isr and fsr contributions is based on the eva generator @xcite .",
    "the efficiency decrease at low masses is due to the increased occurrence of low - p@xmath76 pions with @xmath77 that escape the selection ; the decrease for higher masses , starting from @xmath78 800  mev , is partly due to the cosmic ray veto and partly to the photon detection efficiency .",
    "in fact , high momentum pions , which deposit large energy in the outermost calorimeter layers , veto the event with high probability . moreover , low energy photons ( @xmath79 ) are detected with an efficiency lower than 80% .",
    "the efficiency for the cosmic veto is evaluated using samples of pre - scaled events with no veto applied .",
    "the photon detection efficiency is measured as a function of @xmath70 from @xmath56 and @xmath55 control samples  @xcite .",
    "+ after the selection , @xmath80 decays give the only significant contribution to the background .",
    "we fit the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum , @xmath81 , with the function : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath84 is the selection efficiency , and @xmath85 is the residual background .",
    "the first three terms in parenthesis are here called the `` non - scalar '' terms .",
    "the analytic expressions for the first and second terms , isr and fsr , are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , while the @xmath30 term is taken from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the pion form factor  @xcite , entering the isr term , depends on the masses and widths of the @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 mesons , and on the two non dimensional parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which correspond to the sizes of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 contributions , respectively .",
    "we leave the quantities @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 as free parameters of the fit while the masses and the widths of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 mesons are fixed to the pdg values  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 term is multiplied by a scale factor , a@xmath93 , which is expected to be equal to unity .",
    "if a@xmath93=1 the number of @xmath30 events corresponds to approximately 1% of the total , broadly distributed in the low mass region .",
    "the possible interference between the @xmath30 and the scalar terms is neglected .",
    "the last two terms in parenthesis , scal and scal@xmath94fsr , depend on the amplitude for the decay @xmath24f@xmath95 , the latter being the interference term between f@xmath10 and fsr",
    ". the scal@xmath94fsr term can be either added ( constructive interference ) or subtracted ( destructive interference ) . + we perform three fits corresponding to three different approaches in the description of the scalar amplitude . + the first fit is the kaon - loop fit ( kl )  @xcite : the @xmath5 couples to the scalar through a loop of charged kaons .",
    "the formalism allows the inclusion of more than one scalar meson . for each scalar meson",
    "there are three free parameters of the fit : the mass and the couplings to @xmath96 and to @xmath0 . for the f@xmath10 scalar",
    "meson only , the amplitude reduces to : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the square of the centre of mass energy , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the two couplings , @xmath101 is the kaon - loop function  @xcite , @xmath102 is the phase of the background to the @xmath11 elastic scattering , and @xmath103 is the f@xmath10 inverse propagator with the finite width corrections  @xcite . + in the second fit , called no - structure fit ( ns )  @xcite , a direct coupling @xmath104 of the @xmath5 to the f@xmath10 is assumed , with a subsequent coupling @xmath100 of the f@xmath10 to the @xmath0 pair .",
    "the f@xmath10 amplitude is a breit - wigner with a mass dependent width  @xcite added to a polynomial complex function , the continuum , to allow an appropriate dumping of the resulting line shape .",
    "the amplitude depends on eight parameters : the mass @xmath105 ; the three couplings @xmath106 , @xmath100 , and @xmath107 ; four parameters describing the continuum : two coefficients @xmath108 and @xmath109 and two phases @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the amplitude is : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the @xmath48 momentum in the f@xmath10 rest frame and @xmath114 is the f@xmath10 inverse propagator : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "these couplings have the same meaning as those defined within the kl frame and are related to the non dimensional couplings @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( see for instance  @xcite ) through the relations @xmath120 and @xmath121 strictly valid only when @xmath122 . in order to obtain the correct phase behaviour consistently with chiral perturbation theory predictions  @xcite",
    ", @xmath110 is expressed as a function of the other parameters , reducing the free parameters to seven .",
    "+ finally in the scattering amplitudes ( sa ) fit @xcite the amplitude is the sum of the scattering amplitudes @xmath123 and @xmath124 , whose shapes are fixed by independent experimental information@xcite : @xmath125e^{i\\lambda } , \\label{sa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] free parameters are the six coefficients of the two polynomials , @xmath126 and the phase @xmath127 .",
    "once the amplitude is determined by the fit , it is analytically continued in the complex @xmath25 plane and the coupling @xmath128 is determined by the pole residue .",
    "the coupling @xmath128 , having the dimension of an energy , is connected to the partial width @xmath129f@xmath10(980 ) ) through the relation @xcite : @xmath130",
    "we fit the data in the region @xmath131 , using bins 1.2  mev wide @xcite .",
    "+ first we discuss the fits kl and ns . in both cases ,",
    "a destructive interference is preferred by the fit for the @xmath132 term , while the constructive interference is strongly disfavoured .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fitresults ] , the @xmath133 of the fits and the values of the parameters are given in tab.1 .",
    "the non - scalar part is well described by the parametrisation used , while we are clearly not sensitive to the @xmath30 term .",
    "the f@xmath10 signal appears as an excess of events in the region between 900 and 1000  mev . in the kl fit ,",
    "the attempt to include a second scalar meson ( the f@xmath134 or @xmath135 ) , with either e791  @xcite or bes  @xcite masses ( respectively 478 and 541 mev ) , and with free couplings , gives no improvement to the fit .",
    "moreover , since the couplings preferred by the fit are compatible with zero , within the statistical errors , the f@xmath134 is unnecessary to describe these data .",
    "+ after the subtraction of the non - scalar part obtained in the kl and ns fits , an asymmetric peak around 980  mev with a fwhm of 30@xmath136 35  mev and a height @xmath7825% of the total is obtained , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fitresults](c ) and ( f ) .",
    "such a peak does not directly represent the f@xmath10 shape but it results from the sum of a broad term @xmath137 and a negative interference term @xmath138 that cancels the low mass tail .",
    "the ns fit requires a significantly larger value of @xmath90 than the kl fit does .",
    "this results in a non - scalar part @xmath139% larger in the f@xmath10 peak region , and hence a correspondingly smaller signal size .",
    "+    [ ht ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tsafit ]    in order to assign the uncertainty to the parameters extracted from the fits , we have done a study of several systematic effects @xcite .",
    "we have repeated the fits by varying the following quantities : the luminosity value around its total estimated error ( @xmath140  @xcite ) ; the shape of the photon efficiency and the linearity of the photon response curves ; the size of the @xmath56 background ; the bin size , and the start and end points of the fit .",
    "while repeating the fits , the parameters of the non - scalar part are held fixed to their baseline values .",
    "finally in order to take into account the systematic effect due to the limited knowledge of the non - scalar part of the spectrum , the ns fit has been repeated using the non - scalar parameters obtained from the kl fit and vice - versa . in tab.2",
    "we give the maximal variation intervals for the parameters , resulting from the studies discussed above .",
    "+ the two fits have slightly overlapping intervals for the f@xmath10 mass , and are both in agreement with the pdg interval 980@xmath64 10  mev .",
    "we observe a large discrepancy between the kl and ns couplings @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the kl fit gives couplings in reasonable agreement with the kloe results obtained with the final state @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the two fits are in agreement on the ratio @xmath143 , pointing to an f@xmath10 more coupled to kaons than to pions .",
    "finally if we define an effective branching ratio as the integral over the full spectrum of the f@xmath10 term normalised to the total @xmath5 width , we obtain br(@xmath24f@xmath10(980)@xmath144)@xmath32 br(f@xmath10(980)@xmath145)= 2.1@xmath146 and 2.4@xmath146 for kl and ns fits respectively .",
    "+   + the sa fit is shown in fig.[safit ] and in tab.3 .",
    "the @xmath133 is poorer especially in the f@xmath10 peak region .",
    "notice that a much better @xmath133 can be hardly expected since @xmath147 and @xmath148 are derived from data sets that are less accurate than the data presented here . in any case by properly normalising the amplitude we obtain a value @xmath149 , in agreement with the value obtained in ref.@xcite by fitting the kloe data on @xmath14 together with other data .",
    "however we stress that such a value corresponds to an effective branching ratio of @xmath150 , one order of magnitude lower than the one obtained from the other two fits .",
    "this can be understood since in this case the fit prefers a constructive interference term , hence the scalar term has a smaller size . + using the results of the kl fit , we predict the dependence of the cross - section @xmath151 on @xmath4 .",
    "the predicted behaviour is compared to the data in fig .",
    "[ off - peak ] , in the @xmath4 range between 1016 and 1023  mev . besides the `` on - peak '' data sliced in 0.1  mev wide bins , we show two `` off - peak '' points taken at @xmath4 = 1017 and 1022  mev , respectively . we observe a good agreement for the on - peak data , and a marginal agreement for the two off - peak points . + finally , following the suggestion contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compared the behaviour of the forward - backward asymmetry as a function of @xmath25 , shown in fig .",
    "[ dati](b ) , with a simulation including the f@xmath10 contribution besides the isr and fsr @xcite , and the effect of the @xmath56 background that dilutes the asymmetry in the low mass region .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "the kl parametrisation of the f@xmath10 amplitude has been used .",
    "the inclusion of the f@xmath13 term is essential to have an acceptable agreement between data and simulation in the region of the f@xmath10 peak and also in the low mass region .",
    "this means that the low mass tail of the f@xmath13 amplitude that is cancelled in the @xmath25 spectrum by the destructive interference with fsr , is on the contrary well evident in the @xmath41 spectrum due to the interference with isr .",
    "summarising , we found a clear evidence for the process @xmath24f@xmath10(980)@xmath152 in the @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum and in the behaviour of the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "an acceptable description of the data is obtained with fits kl and ns .",
    "both fits predict the f@xmath10 to be strongly coupled to kaons , the ratio @xmath153 between @xmath154 and @xmath155 being well above 2 as in the kloe measurement of f@xmath156 @xcite .",
    "the coupling to the @xmath5 , @xmath157 is found using the ns approach and is in the range 1.2 @xmath136 2 gev@xmath17 .",
    "a marginal agreement is obtained by applying the fit sa .",
