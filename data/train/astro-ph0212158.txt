    "there are metals in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) even in low density regions such as lyman @xmath8 forest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since metal and dust are relating each other , it is sure that dust grains also exist in the igm .",
    "however , the amount of the intergalactic ( ig ) dust is still quite uncertain although it seems to be not so abundant .",
    "we try to put a new constraint on the amount of the ig dust by using the igm thermal history suggested by the recent observations of lyman @xmath8 forest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after the early attempts to estimate the ig extinction @xcite , @xcite have obtained an upper limit on the amount of the ig dust in terms of the density parameter as @xmath9 , by comparing the observed spectral energy distribution of distant ( but @xmath10 ) giant elliptical galaxies with an average spectrum of similar nearby galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the redshift evolution of the qsos spectral slope provide us with another approach to the ig dust @xcite .",
    "although cheng et al .  ( 1991 ) found no evidence for an appreciable ig reddening up to @xmath113 , this may not be so strict constraint because it is difficult to measure the uv slope of qsos enough precisely owing to the broad and complex iron band superposing on the continua .",
    "recently , we obtain further constraint on the ig dust from observations of high - z supernovae ( sne ) @xcite",
    ". an upper limit of the colour excess by the ig reddening is @xmath12 mag .    by the way",
    ", @xcite suggests that the ig dust can be `` gray '' by a selection rule in the transfer of grains from the host galaxies to the igm .",
    "this occurs when small ( @xmath13 ) grains are destroyed selectively by the thermal sputtering in the hot gas halo of the host galaxies before they reach the igm .",
    "then , the extinction property becomes `` gray '' since the relatively large dust survives .",
    "importantly , such `` gray '' ig dust can avoid the detection by the ig reddening survey like above .    even if the ig dust is really `` gray '' , its evidence should be imprinted in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and infrared background because the dust emits thermal radiation in the wave - band from the far - infrared to submillimetre ( submm ) @xcite . according to the current status , _ cobe _ data",
    "provides us with a rough upper limit on the ig dust @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the submm background radiation may give a more strict constraint on the ig dust .",
    "the emission from the ig dust expected from the modern cosmic star formation history with the grain transfer mechanism of @xcite contributes to a substantial fraction ( @xmath14 75% ) of the measured background radiation in the submm @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to develop the approach of @xcite to match a strong constraint by scuba whose result of the number count accounts @xmath15 90% of the submm background light ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in any current status ,",
    "the amount of the ig dust is still highly uncertain .",
    "hence , it is worth trying to find a new constraint on the amount of the ig dust . in this letter",
    ", it is demonstrated that we can obtain such a new constraint of the ig dust by comparing the observational igm temperature with a theoretical one if we take into account the dust photoelectric heating in the theoretical model .",
    "this is possible because the dust heating is an efficient mechanism in the igm @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the effect of the dust photoelectric heating depends on not only the amount but also the size of dust .",
    "therefore , we can put a limit on the amount of the ig dust as a function of the typical size of the ig grains .",
    "to assess photoelectric effect , we must specify the charge on grain , @xmath16 ( in the electron charge unit ) , which is given by @xcite : @xmath17 where we have assumed a charge equilibrium because a typical charging time - scale is very short ( @xmath18^{-1}$ ] yr under the uv background radiation dominated by qso light given in  3 ) . in the equation , @xmath19 is the collisional charging rate by @xmath20-th charged particle , and @xmath21 is the photoelectric charging rate .",
    "we assume spherical grains for simplicity .",
    "the collisional charging rate is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the charge in the electron charge unit , @xmath24 is the sticking coefficient , @xmath25 is the number density , @xmath26 is the grain radius , @xmath27 is the velocity , @xmath28 is the minimum velocity required to collide with a grain , @xmath29 is the dimensionless collisional cross section depending on both charges and @xmath27 , and @xmath30 is the velocity distribution function .",
    "we simply assume @xmath24 is always unity . in the above equation",
    ", we neglected the effect of the secondary emission .",
    "we can neglect the effect of the `` image potential '' @xcite on the collisional cross section because the obtained charges are enough large . if we assume the maxwellian velocity distribution for the particle , the integral in the r.h.s .  of equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 or @xmath34 for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath37 is the gas temperature , @xmath38 is the charged particle s mass , and @xmath39 .    the photoelectric charging rate is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the absorption coefficient of grains , @xmath42 is the photoelectric yield , @xmath43 is the intensity ( averaged for solid angle ) of the incident radiation at a frequency @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the plank constant , and @xmath46 is the maximum frequency of the incident radiation .",
    "the minimum frequency , @xmath47 , is the threshold photon frequency required for an electron to escape from a grain .",
    "that is , @xmath48 is equal to the ionization potential , @xmath49 , of a grain : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the work function . here",
    "we neglect quantum effects on @xmath49 because it is very small for grains with @xmath52   ( @xcite , hereafter wd01 ) .    according to wd01",
    ", we adopt @xmath53 ev for graphites and @xmath54 ev for silicates . for @xmath41",
    ", we adopt the values of `` graphite '' and `` smoothed uv astronomical silicate '' calculated by @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is estimated , based on the way constructed by wd01 , which includes approximately the effect of the energy distribution of photoelectrons and the geometrical enhancement for small grains , and reproduces recent results of the laboratory experiments even for very small grains .",
    "the both equilibrium charges obtained for graphites and silicates are similar when their radii are equal .",
    "this is consistent with the result of nath et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in the following discussion",
    ", we consider mainly silicate case .",
    "the photoelectric heating rate by a grain with radius @xmath26 is expressed by @xmath55 and the cooling rate of the electron capture ( recombination ) by the grain is @xmath56 , where we have assumed the maxwellian distribution for the gaseous electrons .",
    "we also have defined @xmath57 , the mean kinetic energy of photoelectrons that are emitted from a grain with radius @xmath26 and charge @xmath16 when a photon with energy @xmath58 is absorbed .",
    "this is determined from the energy distribution function of the photoelectrons , @xmath59 , which is assumed to be a parabolic function introduced by wd01 , is equal to @xmath60 in wd01 . ] and is consistent with a typical energy distribution of photoelectrons in the laboratory experiments .",
    "hence , we estimate @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the maximum energy of the photoelectrons and @xmath63 is the minimum energy of the photoelectrons appearing on the grain surface ( however falling back into the grain ) . for the parabolic function adopted here , a typical kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is about half of @xmath64 .",
    "to estimate the total photoelectric heating rate , we specify a characteristic grain size in the igm instead of the size distribution of the ig grains .",
    "this is because the size distribution in the igm is quite unknown .",
    "here we consider three cases for the typical grain size ; 0.001 , 0.01 , and 0.1 .",
    "the smallest case of 0.001  is based on the size of the primary grains produced in the ejecta of sne ii @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to obtain an information about the size of the ig dust as well as to put limits on the amount . from the analysis of the case of very small ig dust",
    ", we can assess the selection rule of the ig dust suggested by @xcite .",
    "the grain number density is given as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the mass of a grain with the radius @xmath26 , @xmath67 @xmath68 is the grain material density , and @xmath69 is the volume grain mass density , which is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mean atomic weight , @xmath72 is the proton mass , @xmath73 is the baryon number density , and @xmath0 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio . we introduce a relative dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath74 , defined as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the galactic dust - to - gas ratio @xcite , for convenience below .",
    "therefore , the total photoelectric heating rate and electron capture cooling rate per unit volume are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the total heating rate is approximately proportional to @xmath79 under the situation considered in the next section .",
    "this is because the heating rate per a grain roughly has a dependence of @xmath80 , i.e. , the grain cross section plus an additional @xmath26 dependence caused by @xmath81 , whereas the grain number density is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed dust mass , the photoelectric effect becomes more important as the grain size is smaller .",
    "the cooling rate by the electron capture is always about an order of magnitude smaller than the photoelectric heating rate .",
    "suppose an ideal fluid element with the mean density of the igm .",
    "the time evolution of its temperature is governed by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the hubble constant , @xmath73 is the cosmic mean number density of baryon , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the total heating and cooling rates per unit volume , respectively , @xmath87 is the number ratio of the total gaseous particles to the baryon particles , i.e. , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number density of the @xmath20-th gaseous species and we consider h  i , h  ii , he  i , he  ii , he  iii , and electron .",
    "then , we solve equation ( [ eqt ] ) coupled with the non - equilibrium rate equations for these gaseous particles . for the rate coefficients , we use those compiled by @xcite .",
    "the adopted initial conditions are @xmath90 , h  i / h(total)=0.99 , he  i / he(total)=0.99 , he  ii / he(total)=0.0099 at redshift @xmath91 , where @xmath92 k is the temperature of the cmb radiation at @xmath93 .",
    "the result is insensitive to the choice of the initial condition if calculation is started at an epoch before h  i reionization .",
    "we also adopt @xmath94 km s@xmath95 mpc@xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and he mass abundance @xmath99 .",
    "to add to the photoelectric heating and the electron capture cooling by grains , we consider the following heating / cooling mechanisms : for cooling , we use the recombination cooling , collisional ionization / excitation cooling , bremsstrahlung cooling , and compton cooling compiled by @xcite . for heating rates , to take account of the radiative transfer effect @xcite , we multiply usual photoionization heating rates by a correction factor of @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the fractional abundance of h  i , he  i , and he  ii relative to total number of h and he .",
    "this factor mimics the situation that atoms are ionized by higher energy photons when the optical depth is large ( i.e. , @xmath101 is nearly unity ) relative to the optically thin limit .",
    "the coefficient @xmath102 is a parameter determined by solving the cosmological radiative transfer .",
    "the metal line cooling is negligible because we consider only the case that metallicity is less than 1/100 solar value and temperature is less than a few @xmath103 k ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we need to give the uv background radiation and the cosmic reionization history to obtain the temperature evolution .",
    "we adopt , for uv background , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the mean intensity at the lyman limit of h  i in unit of @xmath106 erg s@xmath95 @xmath107 sr@xmath95 hz@xmath95 and its evolution is given by equation ( 3 ) in @xcite .",
    "we assume the spectral index to be @xmath108 as a qso dominated background radiation .",
    "for the reionization history , we assume , for simplicity , a sudden reionization of h  i ( and he  i ) at @xmath109 ( @xcite ) h  i reionization , our constraint of the ig dust dose not change because it is determined mainly from the igm temperature after the he  ii reionization . ] ; there is no uv photon before this redshift . to mimic the he  ii reionization at @xmath110 @xcite",
    ", we set the maximum photon energy of the uv background to be 54.4 ev ( he  ii lyman limit ) for @xmath111 and to be 1.24 kev for @xmath112 ( i.e. , a sudden he  ii reionization ) .",
    "other choice of @xmath8 will be discussed later .",
    "we compare our theoretical thermal history at the mean density of the igm with the observational one obtained by @xcite .",
    "they observe the ly@xmath8 forest clouds with the column density of @xmath113 @xmath107 ( i.e. , slightly over density regions ) , and then they convert the temperature at this density range estimated from the minimum @xmath114 ( doppler ) parameters into that at the mean density of the igm by using the observed equation of state of the igm .",
    "thus , we can compare both thermal histories directly .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the igm thermal history obtained for no dust cases and dusty cases of @xmath115 ( silicate grains ) . for no dust cases ( three dotted curves ) ,",
    "the calculated thermal histories are consistent with the data points of @xcite if @xmath1167.0 . for dusty cases ( solid [ @xmath117 0.1 ] ,",
    "dash - dotted [ @xmath117 0.01 ] , and dashed curves [ @xmath117 0.001 ] ) , we observe , especially after the he  ii reionization , temperature enhancement by the dust photoelectric heating . in table 1 , we summarize the temperature enhancement factors at some redshifts for some sets of dust size and dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "all calculations do not include the evolution of the dust - to - gas ratio , for simplicity .     and",
    "he  ii at @xmath118 .",
    "data points with errorbars are taken from schaye et al .",
    "three dotted curves are no dust cases ; bottom : optically thin case , middle : @xmath119 case , top : @xmath120 case , where @xmath102 is the correction factor of the radiative transfer effect . the dashed , dash - dotted , and solid curves are cases of grain radius @xmath121 , 0.01 , and 0.1 , respectively . for these dusty cases ,",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio is set to be 1/100 galactic value , @xmath119 is assumed , and the grain type is silicate .",
    "the middle dotted curve in @xmath111 is almost superposed on the solid curve.,title=\"fig:\",height=207 ]     , dust - to - gas mass ratio of 1/100 galactic value , and radiative transfer correction @xmath119 .",
    "solid curve is the photoelectric heating rate by grains .",
    "dash , dotted , and dash - dotted curves are the photoionization heating rates by h  i , he  i , and he  ii , respectively .",
    "two spikes at @xmath109 and 3.4 are produced by h  i and he  i reionization , and he  ii reionization , respectively .",
    "two thin solid curves are the photoelectric heating rate of the cases of @xmath121 ( top ) and @xmath122  ( bottom ) .",
    "grain type is silicate.,title=\"fig:\",height=207 ]    we also present the time evolution of heating rates per a unit volume for the case of @xmath123  and @xmath115 in figure 2 .",
    "the solid , dashed , dotted , and dash - dotted curves are the dust photoelectric , h  i , he  i , and he  ii photoionization heating rates , respectively .",
    "these heating rates show sudden change at the he ii reionization epoch ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this is because the maximum photon energy increases from 54.4 ev to 1.24 kev suddenly at that time .",
    "we note here that the heating rate by grains is saturated even when the maximum photon energy increases more than about 300 ev in the case of the spectral index of the incident radiation of @xmath108 .",
    "thus , our results are robust for the choice of the maximum energy after the he ii reionization as long as we adopt the energy larger than 300 ev . in addition",
    ", we show the cases of @xmath122 and 0.001  ( and @xmath115 ) by thin curves in figure 2 .",
    "even if we adopt other sets of @xmath26 and @xmath74 , the other curves of the photoionizations do not change so significantly .",
    "let us discuss each case in more detail .",
    "for the cases of @xmath1230.1 , before the he  ii reionization , the photoelectric heating by grains is minor heating mechanism relative to the h  i photoionization heating .",
    "thus , the effect of the photoelectric heating on the igm temperature is very small , i.e. , temperature enhancement is less than a few % .",
    "after the he  ii reionization , the photoelectric heating dominates other heating mechanisms ( but by a factor of less than 3 ) when @xmath115 .",
    "however , the temperature enhancement factor is still less than 1.5 ( solid and dash - dotted curve in figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , the thermal histories of these cases are consistent with that obtained by @xcite when @xmath119 is adopted .    for the case of very small ( @xmath124 ) grains ,",
    "the photoelectric heating is always dominant when @xmath125 .",
    "especially , this heating exceeds the he  ii photoionization heating by a factor of 10 after the he  ii reionization .",
    "then the temperature enhancement factor becomes about 2 at @xmath126 ( dashed curve in figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , the thermal history in this case may be inconsistent with the data from @xcite .",
    "this means that if the typical grain size in the igm is @xmath124 , the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the igm should be much less than 1/100 galactic value .",
    ".temperature enhancement by ig dust . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 2 , we summarize the obtained upper limits of the amount of the ig dust at @xmath127 .",
    "let us compare these limits with the ig dust amount estimated from a possible cosmic star formation history ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "once we assume a cosmic star formation history , the cosmic metal amount can be estimated .",
    "roughly , we find @xmath128 a few @xmath129 at @xmath130 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if we postulate @xmath15 0.5 as the metal depletion to dust grains , which number is suitable for the milky way , we obtain @xmath131 as the total cosmic dust amount at the redshift .",
    "we show in table 2 the upper limits in terms of the density parameter converted from the dust - to - gas ratios by @xmath132 . for the larger grain models , we obtain an upper limit , @xmath133 which is comparable to @xmath134 .",
    "this means that our upper limit may not deny the possibility that most of the dust grains produced in galaxies before @xmath135 escape to the igm as an extreme case .",
    "for very small ( 0.001 ) grain case , we obtain @xmath136 .",
    "thus , a small fraction ( @xmath137 10% ) of such very small grains can escape from the host galaxies to the igm because of @xmath138 .",
    "the latter conclusion is consistent with the suggestion by @xcite , who proposes that the igm is very difficult to be polluted by the very small grains .",
    "the obtained values of the heating rate by the dust photoelectric effect are consistent with those in nath et al .",
    "it indicates that our result is robust against uncertainties of the adopted efficiency factor @xmath41 , photoelectric yield @xmath42 , and energy distribution function of the photoelectrons , etc . , because these are somewhat different between our model and nath et al .",
    "if we consider only graphite grains , the photoelectric heating rate is found to be about 70% of that of only silicate grains , i.e. , silicate grains can be more efficient heating source .",
    "the temperature in the graphite case is lower than that in the silicate case , while the decrement is @xmath137 10% .",
    "these results are also consistent with nath et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we shall comment some uncertainties of our analysis .",
    "first , the effect of the spectral index of @xmath8 is examined . as shown in zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for example , a softer spectrum than @xmath108 is still compatible with observations . if @xmath139 , the heating rates by dust at @xmath140 decrease by a factor of 0.25 ( @xmath117 0.1 @xmath71m)0.5 ( @xmath117 0.001 @xmath71 m ) relatively to our case of @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath141 is used , the heating rates at @xmath140 decrease by a factor of 0.1 ( 0.1 @xmath71m)0.25 ( 0.001 @xmath71 m ) . in these calculations , @xmath115 and @xmath119 are assumed . as the dust heating becomes less efficient ,",
    "a more abundant ig dust is allowed .",
    "then the upper limits for the ig dust amount increase by a factor of 2 ( 0.001 @xmath71m)4 ( 0.1 @xmath71 m ) for @xmath139 and by a factor of 4 ( 0.001 @xmath71m)10 ( 0.1 @xmath71 m ) for @xmath141 relative to the @xmath108 case , because the dust heating rate is proportional to the dust - to - gas ratio linearly .",
    "to summarize , a softer spectral index constrains more loosely the amount of the ig dust by a factor .    it might be possible to take very large @xmath8 .",
    "for example , we consider a background radiation field dominated by only galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath142 ) . in this case , the dust heating rates at @xmath140 become 1/100 ( 0.1 @xmath71m)1/10 ( 0.001 @xmath71 m ) of those in @xmath108 .",
    "however , the thermal histories with @xmath142 never reproduce a steep rise of the observed temperatures at the he  ii reionization . in addition",
    ", the transfer correction should be smaller as the spectrum is softer @xcite .",
    "therefore , the background spectrum is unlikely to be as soft as @xmath142 after the he  ii reionization .",
    "we should assume a harder index .",
    "a caveat against our results is in the correction factor of the transfer effect .",
    "indeed , the effects of the photoelectric heating and the transfer correction can be offset .",
    "thus , we should check this point by solving the cosmological radiative transfer in the future work .",
    "the current work may give a hint for the origin of the large @xmath114 region of the observed igm clouds .",
    "there is a possibility that the large @xmath114 regions are localized .",
    "if the very small grains are located at the restricted areas , a systematic heating owing to the dust photoelectrons may explain the large-@xmath114 at the localized region .",
    "the principal role of the photoelectric heating in the igm temperature also indicates that the theoretical equation of state in the igm should be reconstructed by including the photoelectric heating effect .",

    "<S> this letter investigates the amount of dust in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . the dust photoelectric heating can be the most efficient heating mechanism in the igm where the density is very small and there are a lot of hard ultraviolet photons . comparing the observational thermal history of igm with a theoretical one taking into account the dust photoelectric heating </S>",
    "<S> , we can put an upper limit on the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath0 , in the igm . since the rate of the dust photoelectric heating depends on the size of dust , we find the following results : if the grain size is @xmath1  , @xmath0 at @xmath2 is @xmath3 galactic value corresponding to @xmath4 . on the other hand , if the grain size is as small as @xmath5  , @xmath0 is @xmath6 galactic value corresponding to @xmath7 .    </S>",
