    "the problem of the electromagnetic gauge invariance in the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and similar exclusive processes has intensively been discussed during last few years , see for example @xcite .",
    "this development explored the similarity with the earlier studied inclusive spin - dependent processes @xcite , and the transverse component of momentum transfer in dvcs corresponds to the transverse spin in dis . here",
    "we combine the different approaches to apply them in the relevant case of the drell - yan ( dy ) process where one of hadrons is the transversally polarized nucleon .",
    "the source of the imaginary part , when one calculates the single spin asymmetry associated with the dy process , is the quark propagator in the diagrams with quark - gluon ( twist three ) correlators .",
    "this leads @xcite to the gluonic pole contribution to ssa .",
    "the reason is that these boundary conditions provide the purely real quark - gluon function @xmath1 which parameterizes @xmath2 matrix element . by this fact the diagrams with two - particle correlators",
    "do not contribute to the imaginary part of the hadron tensor related to the ssa @xcite . in our paper",
    ", we perform a thorough analysis of the transverse polarized dy hadron tensor in the light of the qed gauge invariance , the causality and gluonic pole contributions .",
    "we show that , in contrast to the naive assumption , our new - found additional contribution is directly related to the certain complex prescription in the gluonic pole @xmath3 of the quark - gluon function @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and see e.g.@xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "finally , the account for this extra contributions corrects the ssa formula for the transverse polarized drell - yan process by the factor of @xmath4 .",
    "note that our analysis is also important in view of the recent investigation of dy process within both the collinear and the transverse - momentum factorization schemes with hadrons replaced by on - shell parton states @xcite .",
    "we study the contribution to the hadron tensor which is related to the single spin ( left - right ) asymmetry measured in the drell - yan process with the transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "the dy process with the transversely polarized target manifests @xcite the gluonic pole contributions .",
    "since we perform our calculations within a _ collinear _ factorization , it is convenient ( see , e.g . , @xcite ) to fix the dominant light - cone directions for the dy process shown at fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] @xmath5 . focusing on the dirac vector projection , containing the gluonic pole ,",

    "after factorization , this matrix element will be parametrized via the function @xmath1 .",
    "the second term in the numerator of the quark propagator separates out the combination @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , this term will give @xmath15 which , as we will see now , will be exponentiated in the wilson line @xmath16 $ ] ( see details of this in @xcite ) . to eliminate the unphysical gluons from our consideration and use the factorization scheme @xcite",

    "consider now the term with @xmath22 in ( [ hadten1 - 2 ] ) which gives us finally the matrix element of the twist @xmath0 operator with the transverse gluon field .",
    "the parametrization of the relevant matrix elements is @xmath23 using the representation ( [ ag ] ) , this function can be expressed as @xmath24 where the real regular function @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) parametrizes the vector matrix element of the operator involving the tensor @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath28 owing to the time - reversal invariance , the function @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be chosen as @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath1 is an antisymmetric function of its arguments @xcite , while the anti - symmetrization of the additional term with @xmath29 gives zero .",
    "if the only source of the imaginary part of the hadron tensor is the quark propagator , one may realize this property by assumption : @xmath32 corresponding to asymmetric boundary condition for gluons @xcite : @xmath33 . here",
    "we suggest another way of reasoning .",
    "the causal prescription for the quark propagator , generating its imaginary part , simultaneously leads to the imaginary part of the gluonic pole .",
    "we emphasize that this does not mean the appearance of imaginary part of matrix element but rather the prescription of its convolution with hard part ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that the fixed complex prescription @xmath21 in the gluonic pole of @xmath1 ( see , ( [ sol - way-1 ] ) ) is one of our main results and is very crucial for an extra contribution to hadron tensor we are now ready to explore .",
    "indeed , the gauge condition must be the same for all the diagrams , and it leads to the appearance of imaginary phase of the diagram ( see , fig . [ fig - dy](b ) ) which naively does not have it .",
    "let us confirm this by explicit calculation .",

    "we can see that the gauge invariance takes place only if the prescriptions in the gluonic pole and in the quark propagator of the hard part are coinciding . as we have shown , only the sum of two contributions represented by the diagrams on fig .",
    "[ fig - dy](a ) and ( b ) can ensure the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",

    "system , the ssa @xcite related to the gauge invariant hadron tensor ( [ hadten - gi ] ) reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dilepton mass .",
    "we want to emphasize that this differs by the factor of @xmath4 in comparison with the case where only one diagram , presented on fig .",
    "[ fig - dy](a ) , has been included in the ( gauge non - invariant ) hadron tensor .",
    "therefore , from the practical point of view , the neglecting of the diagram on fig . [ fig - dy](b ) or , in other words , the use of the qed gauge non - invariant hadron tensor yields the error of the factor of two .",
    "the essence of this paper consists in the exploration of the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the transverse polarized dy hadron tensor .",
    "we showed that it is mandatory to include a contribution of the extra diagram which naively does not have an imaginary part .",
    "the account for this extra contribution leads to the amplification of ssa by the factor of @xmath4 .",
    "this additional contribution emanates from the complex gluonic pole prescription in the representation of the twist @xmath0 correlator @xmath1 which , in its turn , is directly related to the complex pole prescription in the quark propagator forming the hard part of the corresponding hadron tensor .",
    "we stress that in the previous considerations ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the @xmath51-function was always assumed to be purely real one , while the needed imaginary part was ensured by means of the specially introduced `` propagator '' in the hard part of the hadron tensor .",
    "we have argued that , in addition to the electromagnetic gauge invariance , the inclusion of new - found contributions corrects by the factor of @xmath4 the expression for ssa in the transverse polarized drell - yan process .",
    "finally , we proved that the complex prescription in the quark propagator forming the hard part of the hadron tensor , the starting point in the contour gauge , the representation of @xmath1 like ( [ sol - way-1 ] ) and the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the hadron tensor must be considered together as the deeply related items .",
