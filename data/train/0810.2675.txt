    "already early in run 2 of the tevatron , using less than 100pb@xmath0 of data , total inclusive w and z cross - section measurements were essentially systematically limited @xcite . from the theoretical side , w and",
    "z cross - sections are well - known , fully differentially to nnlo . from an experimental point of view , the tevatron w and z boson datasets provide a pure sample of high-@xmath1 electrons and muons .",
    "now with more than thirty times the statistics of those early measurements , the w and z datasets provide a powerful tool for lepton reconstruction , identification and trigger measurements .",
    "but at a fundamental level , total inclusive w and z cross - section measurements are benchmarks for all high-@xmath1 physics analyses .",
    "a tower of physics measurements is built on the selection of w and z events .",
    "w and z plus photon measurements and heavy diboson ww , wz and zz measurements probe triple gauge couplings ; and the precision of top - quark cross - sections continues to improve .",
    "each of these measurements needs to demonstrate consistent determinations of inclusive w and z cross - sections as a test of the implementation of selections , efficiencies , good run lists and luminosity computations .",
    "observations of the rarer processes can be seen as stations on the way to a heavy higgs boson , decaying to a pair of w bosons @xcite .",
    "however dedicated measurements on single w and z events also continue .",
    "their focus now is on the more challenging tau decay modes , and on using the large datasets to make differential cross - section measurements in order to look for discrepancies with higher - order calculations and to test the edges of phase space , and to make high - precision measurements of standard model parameters such as masses and widths .",
    "tau leptons are more complex objects to reconstruct than electrons or muons , and measurement techniques continue to improve . at d0 ,",
    "@xmath3 identification starts from calorimeter clusters , reconstructed in a cone of @xmath4 , that have their energy concentrated in an inner cone of @xmath5 .",
    "the tracks within the inner cone are required to be consistent with a tau , such that @xmath6gev .",
    "the electromagnetic clusters are considered in terms of sub - clusters , reconstructed from a seed in the most finely segmented ` shower - maximum ' layer of the calorimeter .",
    "tau candidates are assigned to one of three categories , according to the number of tracks and subclusters .",
    "the categories correspond broadly to one - prong , one - prong plus neutral , and three - prong tau decays .    to improve the selection , neural nets are trained for each category on variables that characterise the isolation , shower shape , and correlations between the tracks and clusters .",
    "this results in excellent background suppression .",
    "furthermore , recent improvements in the @xmath3 energy corrections have significantly reduced uncertainties .    d0 selects z@xmath7 from an inclusive muon trigger .",
    "both the muon and tau have @xmath8gev , and in addition there is a minimum requirement on the scalar sum-@xmath1 of the tau tracks .",
    "the leptons have opposite charge .    a data - driven estimate of the qcd background , which is mostly @xmath9 ,",
    "is obtained from same - charge events , and corrected for the expected rate of same - charge events from a qcd - enhanced dataset .",
    "electroweak backgrounds are obtained from simulation , and the w plus jets background is corrected for the component already accounted for in the same - charge events .",
    "the background uncertainties are much reduced compared to previous d0 measurements .",
    "the resulting selection is shown in figure[fig : ztautauplot ] .",
    "1511 events are observed , of which around 20% are background .",
    "a cross - section is extracted : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in z boson production , the rapidity @xmath11 is closely related to the momentum fractions @xmath12 of the interacting partons : at leading order the relation is @xmath13 . measuring",
    "the z boson rapidity is therefore a direct probe of the pdfs of the interacting partons .",
    "furthermore , at cdf , z bosons can be reconstructed over the entire kinematic range in the electron channel , using the forward calorimeters .",
    "this gives access to events at very low @xmath12 , where pdfs are relatively uncertain .",
    "events are selected in three topologies , according to whether the electrons are reconstructed in the central or forward parts of the detector .",
    "backgrounds are estimated in a data - driven way , by forming signal and background templates of the electron isolation distribution , and extrapolating the non - isolated tail into the low isolation signal region .",
    "the acceptance as a function of rapidity is taken from simulation , and the rapidity dependences of the electron identification efficiencies are determined .    the measured rapidity distribution is shown in figure[fig : dsdy ] . whereas previous versions of this measurement have been entirely statistically dominated , the current large dataset results in systematic uncertainties comparable with the statistical uncertainties in some regions of rapidity . comparison is made with an nnlo calculation and nnlo pdfs , and with an nlo calculation and several nlo pdfs .",
    "although at present the measurement does not clearly favour one set over another , with even more statistics there could be some scope for constraining pdfs .",

    "( right ) the z rapidity distribution.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    [ fig : ztautauplot ]",
    "measuring the @xmath1 of the z tests qcd predictions for initial state gluon radiation .",
    "whereas the high end of the @xmath1 spectrum ( above @xmath1430gev/@xmath15 ) is dominated by single hard emissions and perturbative qcd is reliable , the low end of the spectrum is dominated by multiple soft gluon radiation , which must be calculated by resummation or modelled by a non - perturbative parton shower monte carlo .",
    "the resbos event generator implements nlo qcd and the css resummation formalism , using the bnly form - factor and parameters determined by global fits to dis and fixed - target data .",
    "this is a particularly interesting time to be probing this model , as recent global fits have suggested the presence of an extra contribution to the form - factor at small @xmath12 .",
    "this would imply a broadening of the z @xmath1 at high rapidities ( @xmath16 ) at the tevatron , and a significant effect on centrally - produced w and z bosons at the lhc .",
    "d0 has looked for evidence of this effect @xcite .    in 1fb@xmath0 , around 64000 z events are reconstructed in the electron channel , of which around 5000 have @xmath16 .",
    "backgrounds are estimated from templates fitted to the mass distribution @xmath17 .",
    "a regularized unfolding technique is used to recontruct the underlying @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the low end of the z @xmath1 distribution for all rapidities is compared to the resbos prediction , and found to be in good agreement .",
    "the z @xmath1 for events that have @xmath16 is compared to resbos predictions both with and without the extra small-@xmath12 form - factor , as shown in figure[fig : zpt ] . without the small-@xmath12 form - factor",
    "the fit is found to be @xmath18/dof=11.1/11 , whereas with the extra term the fit is @xmath18/dof=31.9/11 .",
    "this measurement therefore disfavours the small-@xmath12 broadening .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the complete z @xmath1 spectrum is examined , a nnlo calculation reproduces the shape well , but requires rescaling by 25% to match the normalisation .",
    "the width of the w boson is predicted very precisely in the standard model , and so its accurate measurement is a powerful check of the consistency of the standard model .",
    "cdf has measured @xmath19 using 350pb@xmath0 of data @xcite .    experimentally , transverse quantities are accessible at the tevatron ; for example the transverse mass @xmath20 .",
    "events can have @xmath21 either as a result of the intrinsic w width , or as a result of detector smearing .",
    "the gaussian effects of detector smearing are found to fall faster than the intrinsic breit - wigner lineshape , so the procedure for measuring the width is to use the region @xmath22gev/@xmath23 for normalisation , and to fit templates to the high @xmath24 region .",
    "events to construct the templates are taken from a leading - order monte carlo , matched with resbos for qcd initial state radiation and with a calculation from berends and kleiss for qed final state radiation .",
    "a fast simulation models electron conversion and showering , muon energy loss , and includes a parametric model of the energy in the detectors not associated with the high-@xmath1 electron or muon ( the ` recoil energy ' ) , which originates from qcd , the underlying event and bremstrahlung .",
    "the final uncertainty on @xmath19 from the recoil modeling is @xmath25mev and @xmath26mev in the electron and muon channels respectively .",
    "the modeling of the tracking scale and resolution and the calorimeter energy scale and resolution are checked on z@xmath27 and z@xmath28ee events respectively ; and also on the j/@xmath29 .",
    "uncertainties from the tracking scale and resolution are @xmath30mev ( e;@xmath31 ) and from the calorimeter scale and resolution @xmath32mev ( e;@xmath31 ) .",
    "backgrounds are dominated by qcd multijet events in the electron channel and by z@xmath27 and decays in flight in the muon channel ( @xmath33mev ( e;@xmath31 ) ) .",
    "distribution for high - rapidity events .",
    "( right ) the transverse mass fit in the muon channel.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   distribution for high - rapidity events .",
    "( right ) the transverse mass fit in the muon channel.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    [ fig : zpt ]    the fit in the muon channel is shown in figure[fig : wwidth ] .",
    "the fits are excellent and the w width is found to be : @xmath34 which is the world s most precise single direct measurement .",
    "it is consistent with the standard model prediction ( @xmath35mev ) @xcite and with cdf s earlier indirect measurement ( @xmath36mev ) @xcite .",
    "the invisible width of the z is measured very precisely indirectly from lep : @xmath37mev .",
    "however the lep direct measurement , using single photon events , is much less precise : @xmath38mev .",
    "an analagous measurement from cdf in 1fb@xmath0 @xcite , using events with a single jet and large missing @xmath39 , is completely uncorrelated .",
    "single - jet events are selected from a missing @xmath39 trigger .",
    "independently , @xmath40 is measured from high-@xmath1 lepton triggers .",
    "the ratio of invisible and visible widths can be written as the ratio of cross - sections : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a correction to take into account the different acceptance of the ` + 1jet ' selection in z@xmath43 events compared to z@xmath44 events .",
    "the visible lepton cross - section is measured to be @xmath45pb .",
    "this leads to an extracted value @xmath46 , where the electroweak backgrounds , qcd backgrounds and visible lepton cross - section make approximately equal contributions to the uncertainty .",
    "this can also be interpreted as a measurement of the number of neutrino species , @xmath47 .    with more data this measurement could become competitive with those from the lep experiments .",
    "w and z cross - section measurements underpin the tevatron high-@xmath1 physics programme .",
    "dedicated measurements continue , harnessing the high statistics datasets : improving tau identification ; testing higher - order calculations and pdfs and probing qcd ; and making precision measurements of standard model parameters .",
