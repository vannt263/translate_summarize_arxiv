    "we consider eigenvalue problems @xmath8 here @xmath5 is a polynomial in the independent variable @xmath9 , which depends on a parameter @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are two rays in the complex plane .",
    "the set of all pairs @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is an eigenvalue of ( [ problem ] ) is called the _ spectral locus_.    such eigenvalue problems were considered for the first time in full generality by sibuya @xcite and bakken @xcite .",
    "sibuya proved that under certain conditions on @xmath14 and the leading coefficient of @xmath5 , there exists an infinite sequence of eigenvalues tending to infinity . if @xmath15 where @xmath16 then the spectral locus , which is the set of all @xmath17 such that @xmath13 is an eigenvalue of [ problem ] , is described by an equation @xmath18 here @xmath19 is an entire function of @xmath20 variables , called the _ spectral determinant .",
    "_ so the spectral locus of ( [ problem ] ) , ( [ p ] ) is an analytic hypersurface in @xmath21 .",
    "it is smooth @xcite and connected for @xmath22 @xcite .    in the first part of this paper we study what happens to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions when the leading coefficient of @xmath5 tends to zero .",
    "bender and wu @xcite studied the quartic oscillator as a perturbation of the harmonic oscillator : @xmath23 here and in what follows @xmath24 means that the boundary conditions are imposed on the positive and negative rays of the real line .",
    "it has been known for long time that the eigenvalues of ( [ bw ] ) converge as @xmath25 to the eigenvalues of the same problem with @xmath26 , but they are not analytic functions of @xmath27 at @xmath26 ( perturbation series diverge ) . to investigate this phenomenon , bender and wu considered complex values of @xmath27 and studied the analytic continuation of the eigenvalues as functions of @xmath27 in the complex plane .",
    "their main findings can be stated as follows : the spectral locus of the problem ( [ bw ] ) consists of exactly two connected components ; for @xmath28 , the only singularities of eigenvalues as functions of @xmath27 are algebraic branch points .",
    "these statements were rigorously proved in @xcite .",
    "discoveries of bender and wu generated large literature in physics and mathematics . for a comprehensive exposition of the early rigorous results we refer to @xcite .    to perform analytic continuation of eigenvalues of ( [ bw ] ) and similar problems for complex parameters ,",
    "one has to rotate the normalization rays where the boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "one of the early papers in the physics literature that emphasized this point was @xcite .",
    "thus physicists were led to problem ( [ problem ] ) , previously studied only for its intrinsic mathematical interest .",
    "an interesting phenomenon was discovered by bessis and zinn - justin .",
    "for the boundary value problem @xmath29 they found by numerical computation that the spectrum is real .",
    "this is called the bessis and zinn - justin conjecture ( see , for example , historical remark in @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture was later proved by dorey , dunning and tateo @xcite with a remarkable argument which they call the ode - im correspondence , see their survey @xcite .",
    "shin @xcite extended this result to potentials @xmath30 with @xmath31 .    these results and conjectures generated extensive research on the so - called @xmath4-symmetric boundary value problems .",
    "@xmath4-symmetry means a symmetry of the potential and of the boundary conditions with respect to the reflection in the imaginary line @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath4 stands for `` parity and time reversal '' .",
    "it turns out that the spectral determinant of a @xmath4-symmetric problem is a real entire function of @xmath13 , so the set of eigenvalues is invariant under complex conjugation .",
    "in contrast to hermitian problems where the eigenvalues are always real , the eigenvalues of a @xmath4-symmetric problem can be real for some values of parameters , but for other values of parameters some eigenvalues may be complex .",
    "so we can see the `` level crossing '' ( collision of real eigenvalues ) in real analytic families of @xmath4-symmetric operators , the phenomenon which is impossible in the families of hermitian differential operators with polynomial coefficients .    in this paper",
    ", we first consider the general problem ( [ problem ] ) and the limit behavior of its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions when @xmath33 with @xmath34 , as @xmath35 , while the coefficients of @xmath36 are restricted to a compact set and @xmath37 does not approach zero . then we apply our general results to certain families of @xmath4-symmetric potentials of degrees @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and prove some conjectures made by several authors on the basis of numerical evidence .    in particular , our results for the @xmath4-symmetric cubic ( [ tr ] ) imply that no eigenvalue can be analytically continued along the negative @xmath38-axis , and the obstacle to this continuation is a branch point where eigenvalues collide .",
    "another result is the correspondence between the natural ordering of real eigenvalues of ( [ tr ] ) for @xmath31 and the number of zeros of eigenfunctions that do not lie on the @xmath4-symmetry axis , conjectured by trinh in @xcite .",
    "this correspondence is similar to that given by the sturm ",
    "liouville theory for hermitian boundary value problems .",
    "a different approach to counting zeros of eigenfunctions is proposed in @xcite , where the authors prove that for @xmath38 large enough , the @xmath39-th eigenfunction has @xmath39 zeros in a certain explicitly described region in the complex plane .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2 we prove a general theorem on the continuity of discrete spectrum at @xmath3 for potentials of the form ( [ aab ] ) , with boundary conditions on two given rays .",
    "previously such problems were studied using the perturbation theory of linear operators in @xcite .",
    "our method is different , it is based on analytic theory of differential equations .",
    "verification of conditions of our general result in section 2 is non - trivial , and we dedicate the entire section 3 to this .",
    "the question is reduced to the study of stokes complexes of binomial potentials @xmath40 , which is a problem of independent interest , so we include more detail than it is necessary for our applications .",
    "the stokes complex is the union of curves , starting at the zeros of @xmath41 , on which @xmath42 , so they are vertical trajectories of a quadratic differential .",
    "stokes complexes occur in many questions about asymptotic behavior of solutions of equations ( [ problem ] ) .",
    "our study permits us to make conclusions on the behavior , as @xmath35 , of the stokes complexes of potentials @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a family of polynomials of degree @xmath46 with bounded coefficients .",
    "we mention here @xcite where a topological classification of stokes complexes for polynomials of degree @xmath6 is given .",
    "in the rest of the paper we apply these results to problems with @xmath4-symmetry . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider the @xmath4-symmetric cubic family ( [ tr ] ) with real @xmath38 and @xmath13 .",
    "we prove that the intersection of the spectral locus with the real @xmath47-plane consists of disjoint non - singular analytic curves @xmath48 , the fact previously known from numerical computation @xcite . moreover , we prove that the eigenfunctions corresponding to @xmath49 have exactly @xmath50 zeros outside the imaginary line .",
    "( they have infinitely many zeros on the imaginary line ) .",
    "furthermore , using the result of shin on reality of eigenvalues , we study the shape and relative location of these curves @xmath51 in the @xmath47-plane and show that @xmath52 on both ends of @xmath51 , and that for @xmath31 , @xmath51 consists of graphs of two functions , that lie below the graphs of functions constituting @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath4analog of the familiar fact for hermitian boundary value problems that `` @xmath39-th eigenfunction has @xmath39 real zeros '' ; in our case we count zeros belonging to a certain well - defined set in the complex plane .",
    "this result proves rigorously what can be seen in numerical computations of zeros of eigenfunctions by bender , boettcher and savage  @xcite .",
    "the result of section 4 also gives a contribution to a problem raised by hellerstein and rossi @xcite : describe the differential equations @xmath54 with polynomial coefficient @xmath5 which have a solution whose all zeros are real . for polynomials of degree @xmath6 , all such equations are parametrized by our curve @xmath55 , and equations having solutions with exactly @xmath50 non - real zeros are parametrized by @xmath51 .",
    "the arguments in section 4 use our parametrization of the spectral loci from @xcite combined with the singular perturbation results of sections 2 and 3 .",
    "these perturbation results allow us to degenerate the cubic potential to a quadratic one ( harmonic oscillator ) and to make topological conclusions based on the ordinary sturm - liouville theory .",
    "next we apply similar methods to two families of @xmath4-symmetric quartics @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an integer .",
    "the first family was considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we prove that the spectral locus in the real @xmath59-space @xmath60 consists of infinitely many smooth analytic surfaces @xmath61 , each homeomorphic to a punctured disc , and that an eigenfunction corresponding to a point @xmath62 has exactly @xmath50 zeros which do not lie on the imaginary axis .",
    "we study the shape and position of these surfaces by degenerating the quartic potential to the previously studied @xmath4-symmetric cubic oscillator .",
    "the second quartic family ( [ bs1]-[bs2 ] ) was introduced by bender and boettcher @xcite .",
    "it is quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) in the sense that for every integer @xmath58 in the potential , there are @xmath63 `` elementary '' eigenfunctions , each having @xmath46 zeros .",
    "the part @xmath64 of the spectral locus corresponding to these elementary eigenfunctions is a smooth connected curve in @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "in the end of section  4 we study the intersection of this curve with the real @xmath47-plane .",
    "similarly to the case of the @xmath4-symmetric cubic , this intersection consists of smooth analytic curves @xmath66 , @xmath67 and for @xmath68 the eigenfunction has exactly @xmath50 zeros that do not lie on the imaginary axis . for @xmath69 the part of @xmath66 over some ray @xmath70 consists of disjoint graphs of two functions , and we have the following ordering : @xmath71 and @xmath70 imply that @xmath72 . moreover , the qes spectrum for @xmath70 consists of the @xmath63 smallest real eigenvalues .",
    "the results of section 4 permit us to answer the question of hellerstein and rossi stated above for polynomial potentials of degree 4 : all equations ( [ hr ] ) that possess a solution with @xmath50 non - real zeros are parametrized by our curves @xmath66 if the total number of zeros is @xmath46 , and by our surfaces @xmath73 if the total number of zeros is infinite .    notation and conventions .",
    "what we call stokes lines is called by some authors `` anti - stokes lines '' and vice versa .",
    "we follow terminology of evgrafov and fedoryuk @xcite .",
    "we prefer to replace @xmath9 by @xmath74 in @xmath4-symmetric problems .",
    "then potentials become real , and the difference between @xmath4-symmetric and self - adjoint problems is that in @xmath4-symmetric problems the complex conjugation _ interchanges _ the two boundary conditions , while in self - adjoint problems both boundary conditions remain fixed by the symmetry .",
    "the main advantage for us in this change of the variable is linguistic : we frequently refer to `` non - real '' zeros .",
    "the expression `` non - real '' excludes @xmath75 , while the expression `` non - imaginary '' does not .",
    "we thank kwang - cheul shin for his useful remarks and for sending us the text of his lecture @xcite and per alexandersson for the plots of stokes complexes he made for this paper .",
    "we begin with recalling some facts about boundary value problem ( [ problem ] ) with potential ( [ p ] ) .",
    "the _ separation rays _ are defined by @xmath76 these rays divide the plane into @xmath77 open sectors @xmath78 which we call _ stokes sectors_. we enumerate them by residues modulo @xmath77 counterclockwise .",
    "a solution @xmath79 of the differential equation ( [ problem ] ) is called _ subdominant _ in @xmath78 if @xmath80 as @xmath81 , for all @xmath82 . for every @xmath83 , the space of solutions of the equation in ( [ problem ] ) which are subdominant in @xmath78 is one - dimensional .",
    "if @xmath78 and @xmath84 are _ adjacent _ , that is @xmath85 then the corresponding subdominant solutions are linearly independent .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath84 be two non - adjacent stokes sectors .",
    "we consider the boundary conditions @xmath86 such boundary value problem has an infinite set of eigenvalues tending to infinity .",
    "all eigenspaces are one - dimensional .",
    "these facts were proved by sibuya @xcite whose main tool were special solutions normalized on one ray , which we call _ sibuya solutions_. precise definition is given below . our first goal is to prove continuous dependence of sibuya solutions on parameters .",
    "we consider a family of polynomial potentials with parameters @xmath87 : @xmath88 let @xmath89 be a compact set which has a fundamental system of open simply connected neighborhoods , and such that @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "this compact @xmath92 will be fixed in all our arguments , so our notation does not reflect dependence of the quantities introduced below on @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be a ray in @xmath94 .",
    "suppose that for some @xmath95 and for all @xmath96\\times k$ ] the following conditions hold :    * a ) * there exists @xmath97 such that @xmath98 for all zeros @xmath9 of @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",

    "this also has an implication that there is `` no monodromy '' in our families @xmath471 : when @xmath144 traverses a loop around @xmath474 , we return with the same function @xmath341 we started with .",
