    "in this contribution we discuss the relation between two important structures in quantum field theory : symmetries on the one hand , and defects of various codimensions on the other . while it is hardly necessary to emphasize the importance of symmetries , defects in quantum field theories or , in a different formulation , quantum field theories on stratified spaces , and their relation to symmetries are a more recent topic of interest .",
    "our exposition is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss a few general aspects of topological codimension-1 defects , both in two - dimensional and in three - dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "a special emphasis is put on the relation between _ invertible _ topological defects and symmetries .",
    "afterwards we consider defects for a particular class of three - dimensional topological field theories : dijkgraaf - witten theories .",
    "an advantage of these models is that they admit a mathematically precise formulation as gauge theories , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "apart from providing insights in a language that is close to standard field theoretical formulations , this allows one to uncover interesting relations between categories of ( relative ) bundles and recent results in representation theory .",
    "it has been recently realized in several different contexts that boundary conditions and defects of various codimensions constitute important parts of the structure of a quantum field theory .",
    "( alternatively , one might say that it is instructive to consider the quantum field theory not only on smooth manifolds , but also on stratified spaces . )",
    "codimension-1 defects , also called interfaces , separate regions that can support different quantum field theories .",
    "such defects arise naturally in applications , ranging from condensed matter systems , where they appear as interfaces between different phases of matter , to domain walls in cosmology .",
    "the aspect we wish to emphasize in this note is the fact that such defects provide a lot of structural insight into quantum field theories , including in particular their symmetry structures .",
    "similarly as in the case of boundary conditions , there are various different types of defects one can consider .",
    "in particular , one can impose various conservation conditions of physical quantities on defects .",
    "an interesting subclass of codimension-1 defects are _",
    "topological _ defects .",
    "they are characterized by the property that the values of correlators for configurations with defects do not change when the location of a defect is only slightly changed , that is , changed by a homotopy without crossing any field insertions or other defects .",
    "examples of such defects have been known for a long time ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "consider , for instance , the two - dimensional ising model , defined by a @xmath0-valued variable on the vertices of a two - dimensional cw - complex .",
    "select a line that crosses bonds transversally , and change the coupling on each bond that is crossed by the line from ferromagnetic to anti - ferromagnetic . in the continuum limit",
    "this provides a topological defect line in the critical ising model .",
    "a particularly important subclass of topological defects are the _",
    "invertible _ topological defects . owing to their topological nature",
    ", two topological defects can be brought to coincidence , leading to a fusion product of defects .",
    "the precise mathematical formulation of the relevant monoidal structure depends on the dimension in which the quantum field theory is defined . for the moment , let us consider two - dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "all statements made in the sequel have the status of theorems @xcite in the case of two - dimensional rational conformal field theories ; the general picture should be much more widely applicable , though .",
    "for a two - dimensional rational conformal field theory , the topological line defects form a monoidal category , with morphisms provided by field insertions which can change the type of defect . in particular",
    ", there is an `` invisible defect '' , which is a monoidal unit @xmath1 in the category of defects .",
    "an _ invertible _ defect @xmath2 is characterized by the fact that there exists another defect @xmath3 with the property that the fusion of @xmath2 and @xmath3 gives the invisible defect , @xmath4 ( thus in particular for every theory the invisible defect is invertible . )",
    "this behaviour leads to the relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ( quantum ) dimension of the defect , which for an invertible defect can take the values @xmath7 ( in unitary theories this is the only possibility ) or @xmath8 .",
    "this relation is to be understood as an identity of correlators when applied locally in any configuration of fields and defect lines . with this relation ,",
    "it is immediate to deduce a connection with symmetries : one has equalities of the form @xmath9 between correlators of different bulk fields .",
    "let us discuss this issue explicitly for the case of the two - dimensional critical ising model .",
    "there are then three primary fields , commonly referred to as the identity field @xmath10 , the spin field @xmath11 and the energy field @xmath12 .",
    "their conformal weights are @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "indecomposable topological line defects of the critical ising model turn out to be in bijection with these fields : in particular , @xmath10 corresponds to the invisible defect and @xmath12 to an invertible defect .",
    "( it is in fact the latter defect that amounts to changing the couplings from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic . )",
    "the action of this specific invertible defect on bulk fields is as follows : it leaves the bulk fields corresponding to @xmath10 and to @xmath12 invariant and changes the sign of @xmath11 . inside rcft correlators for the critical ising model",
    "we thus have the equalities @xmath16    as can be seen from these pictures , there is a natural action of invertible topological line defects on field insertions : wrapping such a defect around a bulk field insertion yields another bulk field .",
    "a further advantage of having a realization of symmetries in terms of invertible topological defects is seen by studying what happens when the defect is moved to a boundary with boundary condition @xmath17 : this process yields another boundary condition @xmath18 , according to @xmath19    in a similar manner , by wrapping around various structures in an obvious way , the group of invertible topological defects acts as a symmetry group on _ all _ data of the field theory , including field insertions of bulk , boundary and disorder fields , boundary conditions and types of defects . in the framework of the tft construction of correlators of two - dimensional rational conformal field theories @xcite",
    ", isomorphism classes of invertible topological defects can be explicitly classified @xcite . in the example of",
    "the critical ising model one finds a symmetry group @xmath0 , consisting of the invisible defect and the @xmath12-defect described above , while e.g.  for the critical three - state potts model one obtains a non - abelian symmetry group @xmath20 .    for the present purposes , it is important to realize that topological codimension-1 defects can also exist in more general classes of quantum field theories .",
    "moreover , in the general case geometric considerations suggest a natural action of such defects on field theoretic structures , like boundary conditions and defects of various codimensions , as well . in short :",
    "defects can wrap around field theoretic structures .      before turning to higher - dimensional field theories ,",
    "we point out that topological line defects are indeed of much wider use : they can also implement kramers - wannier dualities and t - dualities .",
    "if a general topological defect wraps around a bulk field , the following situation is created : @xmath21    in this way a bulk field @xmath22 is turned by the defect @xmath2 into a disorder field . to obtain an order - disorder duality ,",
    "one also needs the opposite process , turning disorder fields into ordinary local bulk fields .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that to this end the dual defect @xmath3 must be used , and that in this case one turns the disorder field back into a bulk field if and only if the fused defect @xmath23 is a direct sum of invertible defects .",
    "this condition can be examined in concrete models .",
    "it is in particular satisfied for the defect corresponding to the spin field @xmath11 in the critical ising model , thanks to the well known fusion rule @xmath24 ; this defect indeed produces the action of the kramers - wannier duality in the critical model .",
    "again we have a natural action on correlators : @xmath25    which shows how correlators involving only bulk fields are related to correlators involving disorder fields .",
    "specifically , through the action of the @xmath11-defect the correlator of four spin fields on a sphere can be seen to be equal to the correlator of four disorder fields , according to @xmath26 and the correlator of two spin fields on a torus can be expressed as @xmath27    t - duality of compactified free bosons can be understood as a special type of order - disorder duality , see section 5.4 of @xcite .",
    "indeed , the chiral data of two t - dual full conformal field theories can be described by the same theory , namely the one describing a @xmath28-orbifold of the free boson theory .",
    "the line defect implementing the duality is then constructed from twist fields of this orbifold theory .      before turning to defects in the specific class of three - dimensional dijkgraaf - witten theories ,",
    "we briefly explain two applications of defects .",
    "the first is in the context of _ relative field theories_. by definition , a @xmath29-dimensional relative field theory is a field theory on the boundary of a @xmath30-dimensional field theory or , more generally , on a codimension-1 defect .",
    "there are interesting cases in which the latter is a topological field theory ; we mention two particular situations : + ( 1 ) the case that the @xmath30-dimensional topological field theory is even an invertible theory .",
    "this provides a geometric setup for describing anomalous theories ; see @xcite .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the case @xmath31 , with the three - dimensional topological field theory being of reshetikhin - turaev type and built from a modular tensor category that is the representation category of a vertex algebra . in this case",
    "the relative theory on a topological surface defect is a local rational conformal field theory whose underlying chiral theory is the one built from the vertex algebra .",
    "this provides a geometric interpretation @xcite of the tft construction @xcite of rcft correlators .",
    "another application of surface defects in three - dimensional topological field theories are quantum codes .",
    "it is well known that the space of qubits of the toric code on a surface @xmath32 can be described by a topological field theory of turaev - viro type .",
    "indeed , the vector space assigned by the topological field theory to the surface @xmath32 contains the information on a vector space together with an action of mapping class groups which is used to construct quantum gates .",
    "two problems are apparent : first , the surfaces @xmath32 of concrete samples typically have a low genus , and thus , according to the verlinde formula , the tft state space space @xmath33 has low dimension",
    ". moreover , the representation of the mapping class group might be too small to allow for universal gates . to circumvent these problems",
    "the idea has been put forward @xcite to consider samples with a bilayer ( or multi - layer ) system and twist defects that create branch cuts .",
    "they effectively lead to systems defined on surfaces of higher genus and thus to higher - dimensional quantum codes with richer representations of mapping class groups .",
    "such systems have been analyzed mathematically @xcite by exploiting results on permutation equivariant categories .",
    "we now turn our attention to a particularly accessible subclass of three - dimensional topological field theories , dijkgraaf - witten theories .",
    "these are topological field theories of turaev - viro type , and they can be constructed explicitly in a gauge - theoretic setting with finite gauge group . we treat them as 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theories .      as a first input datum we select a finite group @xmath34 . the space of field configurations on a closed oriented compact smooth three - manifold @xmath17",
    "is then taken to be the groupoid @xmath35 of @xmath34-bundles on @xmath17 . by considering formally a path integral with vanishing action",
    ", we obtain a partition function that evaluates to @xmath36 here we use the fact that the groupoid @xmath35 is essentially finite , so that there is a well - defined counting measure , its groupoid cardinality .",
    "the groupoid cardinality of an ( essentially ) finite groupoid @xmath37 is @xmath38 where the summation is over the set @xmath39 of isomorphism classes of objects of @xmath37 , each of which is counted with the inverse of the cardinality of its automorphism group .",
    "trivially , the number @xmath40 defines an invariant of the three - manifold @xmath17 .",
    "it is non - trivial , though , that this invariant is local in the following sense .",
    "let us cut the closed three - manifold into two pieces , consisting of three - manifolds with boundaries that are closed oriented surfaces .",
    "suppose that the topological field theory can associate meaningful quantities to such manifolds as well , which would allow us to reduce the problem of computing a three - manifold invariant to computing invariants of simpler manifolds .",
    "to see what the topological field theory @xmath41 should associate to a closed oriented two - manifold @xmath32 , we take a three - manifold @xmath17 with boundary @xmath32 .",
    "for any @xmath34-bundle @xmath42 on @xmath32 , consider the groupoid @xmath43 of @xmath34-bundles on @xmath17 that restrict to the @xmath34-bundle @xmath42 on the boundary @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath43 is an essentially finite groupoid : its groupoid cardinality provides a function @xmath45    p & \\!\\ ! \\longmapsto \\!\\ ! & |\\bun_g(m , p)|    \\end{array}\\ ] ] that depends only on the isomorphism class of the bundle @xmath42 . to the surface",
    "@xmath32 itself , we should associate the recipient for all these functions : the vector space @xmath46 $ ] of complex - valued functions on the set @xmath47 of isomorphism classes of @xmath34-bundles on @xmath32 .",
    "we thus recover the well known feature that a three - dimensional topological field theory assigns vector spaces to surfaces . in the case of dijkgraaf - witten theories ,",
    "these vector spaces are obtained by linearization of ( isomorphism classes of objects of ) categories of bundles .",
    "closed two - manifolds can , in turn , be decomposed , e.g.  in a pair - of - pants decomposition , by cutting them along circles .",
    "hence let @xmath48 be a closed oriented one - manifold and ask what an extended topological field theory should associate to @xmath48 . following the same type of analysis as above , we choose a surface @xmath32 with boundary @xmath48 . fixing a @xmath34-bundle @xmath42 on the boundary @xmath48 , we assign to it a vector space , @xmath49 \\,.\\ ] ] the so obtained map @xmath50 is a vector bundle on the space of field configurations on @xmath48 .",
    "thus the extended dijkgraaf - witten theory based on @xmath34 should associate to @xmath48 the @xmath51-linear category of vector bundles over the space of field configurations . denoting , for an essentially finite groupoid @xmath37 , the functor category from @xmath37 to a category @xmath52 by @xmath53 $ ] , this is the functor category @xmath54 \\,.\\ ] ] we thus learn that a 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theory assigns to a one - manifold a @xmath51-linear category .",
    "the category @xmath55 can be computed explicitly : the category @xmath56 is equivalent to the action groupoid @xmath57 for the adjoint action of @xmath34 on itself . indeed , after fixing a point @xmath58 , a @xmath34-bundle is described by its holonomy @xmath59 , on which gauge transformations act by the adjoint action .",
    "thus @xmath60 $ ] , and this functor category is equivalent to the category of @xmath34-graded vector spaces @xmath61 with a @xmath34-action such that @xmath62 . put differently , we deal with @xmath34-equivariant vector bundles on the group @xmath34 .",
    "this category is actually nothing but the _ drinfeld center _ of the fusion category @xmath34-@xmath63 of @xmath34-graded vector spaces . for later reference , we recall the definition of the drinfeld center @xmath64 of a monoidal category @xmath65 : an object of @xmath64 is a pair @xmath66 consisting of an object @xmath67 of @xmath65 and a functorial family of isomorphisms @xmath68 , called a half - braiding , subject to some further coherence properties ; a morphism from @xmath66 to @xmath69 is a morphism @xmath70 in @xmath65 such that @xmath71 .",
    "the half - braidings endow the drinfeld center @xmath64 with the structure of a _ braided _ monoidal category .",
    "dropping the half - braiding gives a forgetful functor @xmath72    ( u , c_{u- } ) & \\!\\ ! \\mapsto \\!\\ !",
    "& u    \\end{array}\\ ] ] which has a natural monoidal structure .",
    "if a category @xmath73 is already braided , then the braiding provides a braided monoidal functor @xmath74 .",
    "the opposite braiding endows the underlying category with another structure of a braided category , denoted by @xmath75 , and similarly gives a braided monoidal functor @xmath76 .",
    "these two functors combine into a braided monoidal functor @xmath77 from the deligne product of @xmath73 and @xmath75 to the center .",
    "a braided category is called _ non - degenerate _",
    "iff this functor @xmath78 is a braided equivalence .",
    "a non - degenerate ribbon category is called a _",
    "modular _ category .",
    "the preceding considerations for dijkgraaf - witten theories lead us naturally to the general definition of 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theories as a symmetric monoidal 2-functor @xmath79 this definition naturally generalizes atiyah s classical definition of ( non - extended ) topological field theory . in the rest of this subsection",
    "we elaborate on this 2-functor . in the definition",
    ", @xmath80-@xmath81 is the symmetric monoidal bicategory of finitely semisimple @xmath51-linear abelian categories , with the deligne product as a monoidal structure .",
    "the bicategory @xmath82 is an extended cobordism category whose objects are closed oriented one - manifolds @xmath48 , whose 1-morphisms @xmath83 are two - manifolds @xmath32 with boundary together with a decomposition @xmath84 , and whose 2-morphisms are three - manifolds with corners , up to diffeomorphism , again with an appropriate decomposition of the boundary .    according to the definition , the 2-functor @xmath85 assigns to the oriented circle @xmath86 a finitely semisimple @xmath51-linear category @xmath87 .",
    "the trinion ( pair of pants ) , regarded as a cobordism @xmath88 gives a functor @xmath89 .",
    "finally , suitable three - manifolds with corners provide natural isomorphisms that endow this functor with an associativity constraint and the category @xmath90 with the structure of a braiding .",
    "the constraints on these natural transformations , expressed by pentagon and hexagon diagrams , can be deduced from homotopies between three - manifolds with corners . in this way",
    "the category @xmath91 is expected to be endowed with the structure of a modular tensor category ( see @xcite for some recent progress ) .",
    "the reshetikhin - turaev construction can be seen as a converse , constructing a 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theory from a modular tensor category .",
    "incorporating defects and boundaries into a topological field theory amounts to consider an enlarged bicategory @xmath92 of cobordisms . as a warm - up",
    ", we recall the situation for two - dimensional topological field theories with boundaries , also known as open / closed topological field theory @xcite beyond disjoint unions of oriented circles , the category @xmath93 has intervals @xmath94 , with boundary conditions @xmath95 attached to the end points , as additional objects .",
    "morphisms are now surfaces with boundaries consisting of segments which are are either `` cut - and - paste boundaries '' implementing locality or true physical boundaries .",
    "a two - dimensional open / closed topological field theory is a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath96 .",
    "it assigns a vector space @xmath97 to an interval with boundary condition @xmath98 at either end point . for any boundary condition @xmath98",
    ", a disk with three marked intervals on the boundary provides a cobordism @xmath99 ; applying the functor @xmath85 thus yields a linear map @xmath100 .",
    "further analysis @xcite shows that this map furnishes a ( not necessarily commutative ) associative product on @xmath101 , and that @xmath101 is even endowed with the structure of a symmetric frobenius algebra .",
    "a similar argument shows that for any other boundary condition @xmath102 , the cobordism @xmath103 endows the vector space @xmath104 with a linear map @xmath105 and thereby acquires the structure of an @xmath101-module .    in this way one",
    "arrives at the following structure : boundary conditions form a @xmath51-linear category that is equivalent to the category @xmath106 of @xmath101-modules for any given boundary condition @xmath98 . to the interval @xmath107 the topological field theory assigns @xmath108 the vector space of morphisms of @xmath101-modules .",
    "in particular , for any boundary condition @xmath102 , we find @xmath109 , which is an algebra that is morita equivalent to the algebra @xmath101 . if @xmath101 is semisimple , then the commutative frobenius algebra @xmath110 that is assigned to the circle turns out to be the center of the algebra @xmath101 : @xmath111    for three - dimensional topological field theories , we will find a higher - categorical analogue of these structures . in a complete treatment",
    "one should start by giving a precise definition for the extended category @xmath92 of cobordisms ; several definitions have been proposed for this enlarged category , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3 ) . here",
    "we refrain from presenting a formal definition , and instead concentrate on some of the physical requirements that such a category should satisfy .",
    "again we start from oriented three - manifolds , but this time we also allow them to have oriented boundaries that are actual physical boundaries to which boundary conditions need to be assigned , rather than the cut - boundaries that were already present in section [ dwsect ] , which are instead a device for incorporating some aspects of locality into the theory .",
    "we also admit codimension-1 submanifolds , called surface defects .",
    "such a defect separates two three - dimensional regions each of which supports a topological field theory , and the theories associated to the two regions may be different .",
    "labels must be assigned to such defects , too . in this way",
    ", we get in particular invariants of three - manifold with embedded surfaces . in the present setting of 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theories ,",
    "it is natural to go one step further and allow for codimension-2 defects as well",
    ". in particular , there will be generalized wilson lines separating two surface defects from each other , and likewise boundary wilson lines that are confined to a boundary component .    in a next step one",
    "imposes locality by cutting such a three - manifold to produce three - manifolds with cut - boundaries .",
    "it is natural to impose the condition that the cut - surface intersects all structure in the three - manifold , e.g.  surface defects and boundaries , transversally .",
    "boundary manifolds now carry a decoration consisting of lines labeled by surface defects and boundaries labeled by boundary conditions . imposing further locality , as in section [ dwsect ] ,",
    "requires to cut such decorated surfaces transversally .",
    "this yields new types of labeled one - manifolds , which are to be taken as the objects in the bicategory @xmath92 .",
    "let us describe these objects in detail : there are oriented intervals and circles , with finitely many marked points in the interior that divide them into subintervals .",
    "each subinterval is to be marked with a topological field theory .",
    "points adjacent to two subintervals are to be marked by a surface defect , boundary points by a boundary condition .",
    "the possible boundary conditions and types of surface defects have to be determined by a field - theoretic analysis . for the case of dijkgraaf - witten theories we present this analysis in the next subsection .",
    "we now turn to a general analysis of boundary conditions and defects in three - dimensional topological field theories of reshetikhin - turaev type .",
    "the labels for the bulk wilson lines in such a theory are supplied by some modular tensor category @xmath73 .",
    "the boundary conditions of the theory form a bicategory : its objects are boundary conditions , its 1-morphisms are labels for boundary wilson lines , and its 2-morphisms label point - like insertions on boundary wilson lines .",
    "our goal is to describe this bicategory in terms related to the modular tensor category @xmath73 .",
    "we want the boundary wilson lines for a given boundary condition to be topological as well . as a consequence",
    "there is a fusion of boundary wilson lines and we have invariance under two - dimensional isotopies .",
    "this leads to the requirement that for any boundary condition @xmath98 the boundary wilson lines and their insertions form a @xmath51-linear , finitely semisimple , rigid monoidal category @xmath112 . the category @xmath112 is thus a fusion category ; since boundary wilson lines are confined to the two - dimensional boundary , @xmath112 is , however , not endowed with the structure of a braiding .    to derive constraints on the category @xmath112 , we postulate that there should exist a process of moving a bulk wilson line to the boundary , and that this should be as smooth as possible .",
    "( in other words , we exclude possible boundary conditions for which such a smooth process does not exist . )",
    "this provides a functor @xmath113 .",
    "next we impose the condition that the following two processes are equivalent : fusing two bulk wilson lines and then moving them into the boundary , and moving the two bulk wilson lines individually to the boundary and afterwards fusing them in the boundary ; schematically , @xmath114 in formulas , what we postulate is the existence of coherent isomorphisms @xmath115 for all @xmath116 .",
    "this means that the functor @xmath117 has the structure of a _ monoidal _ functor .",
    "similarly , the following two processes should be equivalent : @xmath118 here a bulk wilson line labeled by an object @xmath67 of @xmath73 is moved to either side of a boundary wilson line labeled by an object @xmath119 of @xmath112 .",
    "accordingly we postulate the existence of coherent isomorphisms @xmath120 this constitutes an additional structure on a monoidal functor from a braided category to a fusion category , called the structure of a _ central _ functor .",
    "it can be alternatively described as the choice of a lift @xmath121 of @xmath117 to the center of @xmath112 , i.e.  as the existence of a braided monoidal functor @xmath122 such that the diagram @xmath123\\\\    \\calc \\ar^{f_a}[r ] \\ar@{-->}^{\\widetilde f_a}[ur ] & \\calw_a    } \\ ] ] commutes , with the vertical arrow the forgetful functor described in section [ dwsect ] .",
    "it is now an evident naturality requirement to ask that @xmath122 is an _ equivalence _ of braided categories : the only reason for the existence of a consistent prescription for moving a specific boundary wilson line past any arbitrary boundary wilson line should be that this boundary wilson line actually comes from a wilson line in the bulk via the process described by the functor @xmath117 .",
    "we thus learn in particular that in order to admit boundary conditions of the type just introduced , a modular tensor category @xmath73 must be a drinfeld center .",
    "this constitutes a new phenomenon in three dimensions , for which there is no counterpart in two dimensions : while any commutative algebra ( arising , as explained in section [ sec : defbound ] , as the value of a two - dimensional topological field theory on a circle ) is the center of some algebra ( namely , of itself ) , it is _ not _ true that any braided monoidal fusion category ( arising as the value of a three - dimensional topological field theory on a circle ) is the drinfeld center of a fusion category .    in this context , the following notions are relevant @xcite : two modular tensor categories @xmath124 and @xmath125 are said to be _",
    "witt equivalent _ iff there exist fusion categories @xmath126 and @xmath127 and a braided equivalence @xmath128 the deligne product induces on the set of equivalence classes a natural group structure ; this group is called the witt group of modular tensor categories .",
    "it contains , as a subgroup , the witt group of finite abelian groups @xmath129 that are endowed with a quadratic form @xmath130 .",
    "( such a form determines a modular tensor category , a fact that is relevant for abelian chern - simons theories . )",
    "the obstruction to the existence of boundary conditions for a three - dimensional topological field theory based on a modular tensor category @xmath73 can thus be restated as the condition that the class of @xmath73 in the witt group must vanish , @xmath131 \\,{=}\\ , 0 $ ] .",
    "suppose now we have already found one boundary condition @xmath98 , i.e.  one witt - trivialization @xmath132 .",
    "if @xmath102 is any other boundary condition , denote by @xmath133 the category of boundary wilson lines separating a piece of boundary in boundary condition @xmath98 from a piece in boundary condition @xmath102 .",
    "fusion of wilson lines inside the piece in boundary condition @xmath98 with a wilson line separating @xmath98 and",
    "@xmath102 then yields a functor @xmath134 hereby the category @xmath133 acquires the structure of a module category over the monoidal category @xmath112 .",
    "this amounts to a categorification of the situation in two - dimensional topological field theory analyzed in section [ sec : defbound ] .",
    "the bicategory of module categories over @xmath112 is therefore a natural candidate for the bicategory of boundary conditions .    in much the same way as a left module @xmath17 over a ring @xmath135",
    "is a right module over the ring @xmath136 , the @xmath112-module category @xmath133 is also a right module category over the monoidal category @xmath137 of module endofunctors of @xmath133 .",
    "but at the same time it is also a right module category over the fusion category @xmath138 of wilson lines inside the boundary with boundary condition @xmath102 .",
    "naturality thus suggests an equivalence @xmath139 .",
    "this can only hold true if the fusion category @xmath140 is a witt trivialization of @xmath73 as well .",
    "now indeed it is known @xcite that for any module category there is a canonical braided equivalence @xmath141 so that we do have a canonical witt trivialization for @xmath137 as well .    more generally , given two boundary conditions described by @xmath112-module category @xmath142 and @xmath143 , the category of boundary wilson lines is given by the functor category @xmath144 of module functors .",
    "this can be regarded as a categorification of equation ( [ cschweigert : interval ] ) . at this point",
    "a word of warning is in order : via pullback along the forgetful functor @xmath145 any @xmath112-module category has a natural structure of a @xmath73-module category ; however , not every @xmath73-module category describes a boundary condition for the reshetikhin - turaev theory based on @xmath73 . as an illustration consider kitaev s toric code , which is the dijkgraaf - witten theory based on @xmath146 . in that case",
    "there are @xmath147 inequivalent indecomposable @xmath73-module categories over the drinfeld center @xmath148 of the category @xmath149 of @xmath28-graded complex vector spaces , but only 2 indecomposable module categories over the fusion category @xmath149 .",
    "these two @xmath149-module categories correspond to the two known @xcite elementary boundary conditions for the toric code .",
    "the results obtained above are easily extended to surface defects that separate three - dimensional topological field theories of reshetikhin - turaev type based on two modular tensor categories @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "again , one starts with a fusion category @xmath150 of defect wilson lines that are confined to the defect surface .",
    "we now get two monoidal functors @xmath151 which combine into a single functor @xmath152 again this functor @xmath153 has the structure of a central functor , yielding a functor @xmath154 that is again argued to be , by naturality , a braided equivalence .",
    "this leads to the following obstruction : surface defects of the type studied here only exist if the classes of the two modular tensor categories in the witt group are equal , @xmath155 \\,{=}\\ , [ \\calc_2]$ ] .",
    "our discussion is , deliberately , not at the highest possible conceptual level . in analogy with the fact that morita equivalent algebras can be naturally discussed in a bicategorical setting with bimodules as 1-morphisms , in the present situation",
    "there is an underlying 3-categorical structure .",
    "also , we did not discuss fusion of topological surface defects .",
    "indeed , surface defects form a monoidal bicategory .",
    "the monoidal unit is called the _ transparent surface defect _ , which separates a modular tensor category @xmath73 from itself .",
    "the underlying witt trivialization is based on @xmath73 , seen as a fusion category , and the braided equivalence @xmath156 which follows by equation ( [ cschweigert : cantriv ] ) from the fact that @xmath73 is modular .",
    "ordinary wilson lines are then recovered as defect wilson lines separating the transparent defect from itself .",
    "we now describe an explicit gauge - theoretic construction @xcite of boundary conditions and surface defects for dijkgraaf - witten theories .",
    "a key idea is to keep the two - step procedure outlined in section [ dwsect ] : first we assign to manifolds of various dimension groupoids of ( generalized ) bundles , and then we linearize those categories .      in our construction ,",
    "relative bundles are the appropriate tool for describing boundaries . in the case of a surface defect @xmath169",
    "the situation is somewhat more subtle .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 divides the three - manifold @xmath17 into two disjoint connected components @xmath170 .",
    "we consider the situation that dijkgraaf - witten theories for two , possibly different , finite groups @xmath171 are associated to the components @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "denote by @xmath174 the closure of @xmath170 in @xmath17 , and by @xmath175 the corresponding embeddings .",
    "we then consider , for a given group homomorphism @xmath176 as field configurations the groupoid whose objects consist of two @xmath171-bundles @xmath177 , an @xmath160-bundle @xmath178 and an isomorphism @xmath179 of @xmath180-bundles on @xmath32 .",
    "we have to add yet one further datum to dijkgraaf - witten theories .",
    "namely , typically , the linearization of groupoids is twisted by a 2-cocycle on the relevant groupoid of generalized bundles .",
    "this requires the choice of additional data on the finite groups involved .",
    "we first discuss the situation without boundaries and without surface defects , for a dijkgraaf - witten theory based on a finite group @xmath34 .",
    "then the additional datum is a three - cocycle @xmath181 on the group .",
    "a more geometrically inclined reader is invited to think about this cocycle as a three - cocycle on the stack @xmath182 of @xmath34-bundles , and thus as a ( chern - simons ) 2-gerbe on @xmath182 .",
    "such a three - cocycle leads to a holonomy on closed three - manifolds and thus furnishes a topological lagrangian , yielding a three - dimensional topological field theory @xmath183 . to determine the category @xmath184",
    ", we need a 2-cocycle @xmath185 on the groupoid @xmath186 , the action groupoid for the adjoint action of @xmath34 on itself .",
    "the transgressed 2-cocycle @xmath185 can be obtained @xcite from the group cocycle @xmath187 by evaluating @xmath187 on a suitable triangulated three - manifold .",
    "this indeed produces the well - known 2-cocycle @xcite for dijkgraaf - witten theories .",
    "we now illustrate the generalization of this prescription to boundaries and defects in an example .",
    "let @xmath188 be an interval with a marked point in its interior , corresponding to a surface defect .",
    "to each of the two subintervals @xmath189 we a assign a finite group @xmath190 and three - cocycles @xmath191 , of which we think of as topological bulk lagrangians . to the end point adjacent to the first interval ,",
    "we assign a group homomorphism @xmath192 and a boundary lagrangian as follows .",
    "we think about the three - cocycle @xmath193 on @xmath194 as a chern - simons 2-gerbe on @xmath195 . the group homomorphism @xmath196 induces a morphism @xmath197 of 2-gerbes .",
    "a similar situation , one categorical dimension lower , is familiar from the study of d - branes , see e.g.  @xcite : for d - branes , one has a gerbe on the bulk manifold and a morphism of gerbes on the boundary , from the trivial gerbe to the restriction of the bulk gerbe .",
    "this is an instance of the general principle that in gauge theories , holonomies of manifolds with boundary , and thus topological actions on such manifolds , can only be defined if a trivialization on the boundary is chosen .",
    "in the situation at hand , what is to be trivialized is the restriction of the chern - simons 2-gerbe to @xmath198 .",
    "thus in terms of group cochains , we are looking for a 2-cochain @xmath199 that represents a morphism from the trivial 2-gerbe on @xmath200 to the 2-gerbe described by the restriction of the three - cocycle @xmath193 on @xmath194 to @xmath198 .",
    "accordingly we impose the condition @xmath201 .",
    "we think about @xmath202 as a topological boundary lagrangian .",
    "the situation at the other end point is , in complete analogy , described by a group homomorphism @xmath203 and a 2-cochain @xmath204 such that @xmath205 .    in a similar vein ,",
    "the situation for the surface defect is a higher - categorical analogue of bibranes @xcite , which describe the target space physics of topological defects in two - dimensional conformal field theory : we now have a group homomorphism @xmath206 and a 2-cochain @xmath207 satisfying @xmath208 , with the group homomorphisms @xmath209 obtained from @xmath210 and the canonical projections .",
    "indecomposable boundary conditions and defects correspond to group homomorphisms @xmath211 , respectively @xmath210 , that are injective , i.e.  are subgroup embeddings .    in @xcite ,",
    "an explicit prescription was given for transgressing these cochains to a 2-cocycle on the relevant category of ( generalized ) relative bundles .",
    "this prescription is a generalization of the one given in @xcite for dijkgraaf - witten theories without boundaries or defects .",
    "it makes the categories associated to one - manifolds with defects and boundaries quite explicitly computable .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are also general results for boundary conditions and defects in three - dimensional topological field theories of reshetikhin - turaev type .",
    "suppose the theory is based on a modular tensor category @xmath52 .",
    "the model independent analysis of section [ sec : tftb ] reveals that topological boundary conditions only exist if the category @xmath52 is braided equivalent to the drinfeld center of a fusion category @xmath212 . for dijkgraaf - witten theories based on a finite group @xmath34 and a three - cocycle @xmath181 , this condition is satisfied automatically : the category @xmath213 is the drinfeld center of the category @xmath214 of @xmath34-graded vector spaces with associator twisted by the three - cocycle @xmath187 .",
    "recall from the general analysis in section [ sec : tftb ] that boundary conditions are in bijection with module categories over the fusion category @xmath212 .",
    "for the fusion category @xmath214 relevant for dijkgraaf - witten theories , indecomposable module categories are , in turn , known @xcite to be in bijection with subgroups @xmath215 and 2-cochains @xmath216 such that @xmath217 .",
    "this matches exactly the gauge - theoretic description of types of boundary conditions . according to the general results @xcite ,",
    "the topological field theory should assign to an interval with dijkgraaf - witten theory based on @xmath218 and boundaries with boundary conditions @xmath219 and @xmath220 the category @xmath221 of module functors from the indecomposable module category @xmath222 over the fusion category @xmath223 to the indecomposable module category @xmath224 .",
    "a non - trivial calculation @xcite shows that this category coincides , as a finitely semisimple abelian category , with the category obtained by linearizing categories of generalized relative bundles .",
    "a similar calculation can be performed for the circle with surface defects as point - like insertions .",

    "such a coherent trace can indeed be constructed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.3 ) and gives rise to results that are in accordance with gauge theoretic calculations in dijkgraaf - witten theories ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.5 ) .",
    "we now turn to the relation between symmetries of three - dimensional topological field theories of turaev - viro type and invertible surface defects .",
    "for such a theory , the modular tensor category @xmath52 of bulk wilson lines is the drinfeld center of a fusion category @xmath212 , i.e.  @xmath225 .    according the paradigm discussed in section 1",
    ", symmetries should correspond to invertible topological surface defects , and their action should be described by wrapping those defects . by the analysis presented in the preceding subsection ,",
    "invertible surface defects are described by invertible bimodule categories over the fusion category @xmath212 .",
    "these form a monoidal bicategory ; restricting to only invertible 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms in this bicategory , one obtains a categorical 2-group , the brauer - picard 2-group @xcite .",
    "its isomorphism classes form a finite group @xmath226 ; in the sequel work with this group , rather than the underlying 2-group .    applying an extended topological field theory to a two - manifold with boundary yields a functor .",
    "take this two - manifold to be a cylinder with a surface defect of type @xmath2 wrapping the non - contractible cycle :",
    "@xmath227    this yields an endofunctor @xmath228 .",
    "a detailed analysis @xcite shows that if the defect @xmath2 is invertible , then the functor @xmath229 has the structure of a braided monoidal autoequivalence . in the case of dijkgraaf - witten theories ,",
    "the modular tensor category of bulk wilson lines is @xmath230 , and an invertible ( and thus indecomposable ) defect is given by a subgroup @xmath231 and a 2-cochain @xmath216 .",
    "the functor @xmath232 can then be explicitly obtained by linearizing the span of action groupoids @xmath233\\ar_{\\hat \\pi_1}[dl]&\\\\     g/\\!/g & & g/\\!/g    } \\ ] ] for adjoint actions which describe the relevant categories of ( relative ) bundles . here",

    "it is also shown in @xcite that the group homomorphism is actually an _",
    "_ iso__morphism .",
    "according to the considerations above , this representation theoretic result can be reinterpreted as the statement that symmetries of topological field theories of turaev - viro type can already be detected from their action on the category of bulk wilson lines .",
    "we now restrict our attention to the class of dijkgraaf - witten theories with vanishing three - cocycle and based on a finite abelian group @xmath129 . in this case",
