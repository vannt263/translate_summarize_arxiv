    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) have become practical technology due to the production of low cost , low - power , and small size sensors .",
    "different applications such as habitat and climate monitoring , detection of human / vehicular intrusion , and etc . are increasingly employing wsns @xcite .",
    "such applications require sensor nodes to be deployed over a remote area to collect data from the surrounding environment and communicate it to far base stations or access points ( bss / aps ) . as a result , the challenges faced in the wsn applications are quite different from that of considered in the applications of the traditional wireless ad - hoc networks @xcite .",
    "these differences can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "typical wsn is densely deployed and may consist of thousands of sensor nodes . * the network geometry changes all the time due to failure of sensor nodes or deployment of new sensor nodes . *",
    "sensor nodes are battery - powered and the battery often can not be replaced .",
    "thus , the sensor node life time is limited by the battery lifetime .",
    "* sensor nodes have simple hardware with limited computational capabilities and small memory in order to keep the production cost of the sensor node reasonable .",
    "* sensor nodes can fail easily .",
    "thus , it is desired that the wsn performance does not depend on individual sensor nodes . *",
    "data and traffic models in wsns depend on the application , and usually the data is redundant , while the traffic has low - rate burst nature . * sensor nodes in wsns",
    "are usually deployed at the ground level and have no mobility .",
    "thus , the channel path loss for individual node is high and the channel variations are slow .    practical communication schemes for wsns should overcome the problem of limited transmission range of individual sensor nodes , while being distributed and scalable .",
    "moreover , for designing such communication schemes , power consumption and implementation complexity issues have to be taken into account as the most significant design constraints for wsns .",
    "to address the aforementioned issues , the inherent high density deployment of sensor nodes has been used to introduce collaborative beamforming ( cb ) for the uplink communication to a bs / ap @xcite , @xcite .",
    "cb extends the transmission range of individual sensor nodes by using a cluster of sensor nodes in a power - efficient way .",
    "particularly , sensor nodes from a cluster of nodes act collaboratively as distributed antenna array to form a beam toward the direction(s ) of the intended bs(s)/ap(s ) .",
    "given that each sensor node is equipped with a single omnidirectional antenna and operates in half - duplex mode , cb is performed in two stages . in the first stage",
    ", the data from source node(s ) in a cluster is shared with all other collaborative nodes , while in the second stage , this data is transmitted by all sensor nodes simultaneously and coherently . in the latter stage ,",
    "sensor nodes adjust the initial phase of their carriers so that the individual signals from different sensor nodes arrive in phase and constructively add at the intended bs / ap . in this way",
    ", cb is able to increase the area coverage of wsns and , therefore , can be also viewed as an alternative scheme to the multi - hop relay communications . however , as compared to the multi - hop relay communications , cb brings the following advantages .    * for cb",
    ", there is no dependency of communication quality on individual nodes .",
    "thus , the communication link is more reliable . *",
    "cb distributes the power consumptions over large number of sensor nodes and balances the lifetimes of individual nodes @xcite . *",
    "cb enables to create a direct single - hop uplink to the intended bs(s)/ap(s ) .",
    "thus , it reduces the communication delay and data overhead . *",
    "cb achieves higher connectivity than that of omnidirectional transmission with the same transmit power @xcite .    in order to implement cb ,",
    "the following issues related to the the distributed nature of the wsns have been addressed .",
    "distributed schemes for estimating the initial phases of the local node oscillators in wsns have been introduced in @xcite@xcite .",
    "these schemes allow to achieve phase synchronization among all collaborative nodes in a cluster of wsn . moreover , to minimize the time required for multiple sources to share the data among all sensor nodes in a cluster , a medium access control - physical ( mac - phy ) cb scheme which is based on the medium random access has been proposed in @xcite .    although , the above mentioned implementation issues for cb have been positively addressed , one more concern is that the random sensor node locations result in a random beampattern which depends on the actual locations .",
    "the effect of the spatial sensor node distribution on the directivity of the cb beampattern has been studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the case of uniform sensor node distribution and in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite for the case of gaussian sensor node distribution .",
    "although it has been shown for both aforementioned node distributions that the cb sample beampattern has a deterministic mainlobe which is independent on the random sensor node locations , the sidelobes of the cb sample beampattern are totaly random and can be described only in statistical terms @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , the aforementioned multiple access scheme of @xcite , which minimizes the time required for sharing the multiple source data , results in higher sidelobes even for the average cb beampattern .",
    "all these can lead to high interference levels at the directions of unintended bss / aps .",
    "therefore , the sidelobe control problem arises in the context of wsns . indeed , achieving a _ sample _ cb beampattern with lower sidelobe interference at unintended",
    "bss / aps has the potential to increase the wsn throughput @xcite .    due to the inherent distributed nature of wsns",
    ", the sidelobe control should be achieved with minimum data overhead and knowledge of the channel information .",
    "unfortunately , traditional sidelobe control techniques @xcite can not be applied in the context of wsns due to their unacceptably high complexity and the requirement of centralized processing . indeed , to apply the centralized beamforming weight design in the wsns , a node or bs / ap has to collect the location and channel information from all sensor nodes .",
    "it can significantly increase the overhead in the network and nullify the above mentioned advantages of cb .",
    "note that for the same reasons the recently developed network beamforming techniques @xcite are restricted to the applications in the relay networks only and it is impractical to apply them for wsns .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a technique for sidelobe control in cb for wsns which is based on sensor node selection .",
    "such technique makes use of the randomness of node locations and is distributed and scalable as well as it has low data overhead .",
    "moreover , as compared to the optimal beamforming weights assignment , our sidelobe control technique which is based on the phase synchronization and simple node selection is more robust to the channel / phase errors .",
    "in addition , it helps to balance the life times of all sensor nodes since the corresponding beamforming weights have the same magnitude for all nodes .",
    "for the sidelobe control technique , a node selection algorithm with low - rate feedback is developed to search over different node combinations .",
    "the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of the average number of trials required to select the collaborative nodes and the distribution of the resulting interference .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "system and signal models are introduced in section  ii .",
    "a new sidelobe control technique for cb in wsns is developed in section  iii where the node selection algorithm is also summarized .",
    "the performance characteristics of the proposed node selection algorithm such as the average number of trials required to select the collaborative nodes and the resulting interference are studied in section  iv .",
    "section  v reports our simulation results and is followed by conclusions in section  vi .",
    "proofs of some results in the paper are summarized in appendixes .",
    "we consider a wsn with nodes randomly placed over a plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : journal2_fig1 ] . multiple bss / aps , denoted as @xmath0 , are located outside and far apart from the coverage area of each individual node at directions @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "uplink transmission is a burst traffic for which the nodes are idle most of the time and have sudden transmissions .",
    "thus , we adopt a time - slotted scheme where nodes are allowed to transmit at the beginning of each time slot .",
    "the downlink transmissions are mostly the control data broadcasted over a separate error - free control channels .",
    "the bss / aps can use high power transmission and , therefore , the downlink is less challenging and can be organized as direct transmission .",
    "we assume that due to the limited power of individual nodes , direct transmission to the bss / aps is not feasible and sensor nodes have to employ cb for the uplink transmission .",
    "the distance between nodes in one cluster of wsn is small so that the power consumed for communication among nodes in the cluster can be neglected .",
    "each sensor node is equipped with a single antenna used for both transmission and reception . to identify different nodes and bss / aps , each node or bs / ap to has a unique identification ( i d ) sequence that is included in each transmission .    at each time slot ,",
    "a set @xmath2 of source nodes is active .",
    "moreover , only @xmath3 source  destination pairs are allowed to communicate . here",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the cardinality of a set , and the @xmath6th source  destination pair is denoted as @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "for source node @xmath7 , the coverage area is , ideally , a circle with a radius which depends on the power allocated for the node - to - node communication .",
    "let @xmath9 be a set of nodes in the coverage area of the node @xmath7 .",
    "let us , therefore , select the source node @xmath7 as a local origin of the coordinate system used to mark the spatial locations of the nodes in the coverage area of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath9 . the @xmath10th collaborative node , denoted as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , has a polar coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the euclidean distance between the collaborative node @xmath11 and a point @xmath14 in the same plane is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 in the far - field region .",
    "the array factor for the set of sensor nodes @xmath9 in a plane can be defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transmission power assigned to each node , @xmath19 is the initial phase of the @xmath10th sensor carrier frequency , @xmath20 is the phase delay due to propagation at the point @xmath14 , and @xmath21 is the wavelength",
    ". then the far - field beampattern corresponding to the set of sensor nodes @xmath9 can be found as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the magnitude of a complex number .",
    "it is assumed that the symbol duration is very short as compared to the channel coherent time .",
    "therefore , the channel variations can be considered to be quasi - static during one symbol transmission . since",
    "sensor nodes are located at the ground level , the large - scale fading is the dominant factor for the channels between collaborative nodes in @xmath9 and bss / aps .",
    "then the channel coefficient for @xmath10th collaborative node which serves @xmath6th source  destination pair can be modeled as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the attenuation / path loss factor in the channel coefficient due to propagation distance and @xmath26 is a lognormal distributed random variable which represents the flactuation / shadowing effect in the channel coefficient , i.e. , @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 denote respectively the mean and variance , of the corresponding gaussian distribution .",
    "then the mean and variance of the lognormally distributed @xmath26 can be found as @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for the statistical expectation .",
    "the attenuation / path loss depends on the distance between @xmath11 and @xmath8 and the path loss exponent . assuming that all nodes in @xmath9 are close to each other , the pass losses from the nodes in @xmath9 to the bs / ap are equal to each other , i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "moreover , since all bss / aps are located far apart from the cluster of collaborative nodes , the network can be viewed as homogeneous and the attenuation effects of different paths can be assumed approximately equal to each other , i.e. , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "note that even if the attenuation effects for different bss / aps are different , they can be compensated by adjusting the gains of the corresponding receivers or the power / number of the corresponding collaborative nodes participating in cb .",
    "consider a two  step transmission which consists of the information sharing and the actual cb steps .",
    "information sharing aims at broadcasting the data from one source node to all other nodes in its coverage area .",
    "specifically , in this step , the source node @xmath7 broadcasts the data symbol @xmath35 to all nodes in its coverage area @xmath9 , where the data symbol @xmath36 belongs to a codebook of zero mean , unit power , and independent symbols , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .    in the case of multiple source nodes sharing their own data with other nodes in their corresponding collaborative sets of nodes , a collision can occur . to avoid the collision , orthogonal channels in frequency , time , or code",
    "can be used .",
    "however , such collision avoidance causes resource loss and can lead to the network throughput reduction , especially if the number of source nodes sharing the data is large .",
    "therefore , collision resolution schemes can be used alternatively ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the information sharing takes only one time slot in a random access fashion .",
    "finally , we assume that the power used for broadcasting the data by the source node is high enough so that each collaborative node @xmath11 can successfully decode the received symbol from the source node @xmath7 .    during the cb step , each collaborative node @xmath41 ,",
    "is first synchronized with the initial phase @xmath42 using the knowledge of the node locations ( see the closed - loop scenario in @xcite ) . alternatively the synchronization can be performed without any knowledge of the node locations ( see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "for example , the synchronization algorithm of @xcite uses a simple 1-bit feedback iterations , while the methods of @xcite and @xcite are based on the time - slotted round - trip carrier synchronization approach .    after synchronization ,",
    "all collaborative nodes transmit the signal coherently @xmath43 then the received signal at angle @xmath44 can be given as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the direction @xmath44 .",
    "note that the white noise is the same at all angles and , therefore , it disturbs the cb beampattern equally in all directions .",
    "the received noise power @xmath47 at bss / aps can be measured in the absence of data transmission and , therefore , is assumed to be known at each bs / ap .",
    "the received signal at the intended bs / ap @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the real and the imaginary parts of a complex number , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are random variables .",
    "it can be further shown ( see appendix a ) that @xmath56 has mean @xmath57 and variance @xmath58 .",
    "the first term in is the signal received at the the bs / ap @xmath48 from the desired set of collaborative nodes @xmath59 , while the second term represents the interference caused by other sets of nodes @xmath9 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62",
    ". assumed that each node in the network utilizes the same amount of power for each cb transmission , i.e. , @xmath63 , the received signal at the bs / ap @xmath48 can be rewritten as    @xmath64",
    "in dense wsns , each source node is surrounded by many candidate collaborative nodes in its coverage area .",
    "although it has been shown earlier that the sidelobe levels of the average beampattern decrease inverse proportionally and uniformly over all directions with the increase of the number of collaborative nodes @xcite , @xcite , the sidelobe levels at particular directions of interest ( unintended bss / aps ) in the sample beampattern are totaly random and can be unacceptably high if the number of collaborative nodes is not very large . at the same time",
    ", the randomness of the node locations provides additional degrees of freedom for controlling the beampattern sidelobes .",
    "indeed , the sidelobes corresponding to different sets of collaborative nodes are different @xcite , @xcite .    the problem of high sidelobe levels at specific directions for the average beampattern has been briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is suggested there to use only the sensor nodes placed in multiple concentric rings instead of using all nodes in the disk of the coverage area .",
    "however , a narrower ring with larger radiuses results in the average beampattern with smaller mainlobe width and leads to larger sidelobe peak levels at other uncontrolled directions than the conventional cb .",
    "moreover , only the average beampattern behavior is considered in @xcite , while it is the sample beampattern behavior that is of real importance for the sidelobe control in wsns .    exploiting the randomness of the node locations in wsns",
    ", we introduce and study in this section a node selection algorithm for sidelobe control of the cb sample beampattern as a method for interference reduction . a sidelobe control approach based on node selection",
    "is suitable for wsn applications because it allows to avoid complex central beamforming weight design and corresponding additional communications .",
    "it is required to select a subset of collaborative nodes from the candidate nodes in the coverage area of the source node .",
    "let @xmath65 be a set of collaborative nodes to be selected from @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath66 , to beamform data symbols to @xmath8 .",
    "note that in accordance with @xcite and @xcite , the mainlobe of the beampattern is stable and does not change for different subsets of @xmath9 as long as the the size of the coverage area does not change and the wsn is sufficiently dense , i.e. , each cluster of the wsn consists of a sufficiently large number of sensor nodes .",
    "also note that the set @xmath65 can be updated any time when the channel conditions or network configuration change .",
    "alternatively , it can be updated periodically to balance power consumptions among nodes .",
    "the meaningful objective for node selection is to achieve a beampattern with low level sidelobes toward the unintended bs / ap directions .    toward this end",
    ", we develop a low - complexity distributed node selection algorithm , which guarantees that the sidelobe levels toward unintended direction(s ) are below a certain prescribed value(s ) as long as the wsn is sufficiently dense .",
    "an algorithm utilizes only the knowledge of the received interference power to noise ratio ( inr ) , denoted as @xmath67 , at the unintended destinations and requires only low - rate ( essentiality , one - bit ) feedback from the unintended bss / aps at each trial . although our node selection strategy does not guarantee the optimum result of centralized beamforming strategies ( which require global csi and , therefore , a very significant data overhead in the network ) , it has the following practically important advantages for applying in the wsns context .    *",
    "it is very simple computationally and can be run in cheap sensor nodes without adding any computations .",
    "*  it has a distributed nature and , therefore , uses minimum control feedback from the unintended bss / aps .    in the following ,",
    "we first describe the communication protocol and then give the details of the node selection algorithm .",
    "data transmission is organized in the following steps .",
    "* at the beginning of each time - slot , the source node @xmath7 listens to the control channels from bss / aps and checks for an available bs / ap .",
    "* the source node @xmath7 broadcasts its i d and the i d of the available bs / ap @xmath8 to the nodes in its coverage area @xmath9 .",
    "note that all transmissions from the source node @xmath7 to the intended destination @xmath8 will be achieved through the cb using the nodes in the set of collaborative nodes @xmath66 . *",
    "the source node @xmath7 attempts to transmit its i d to the target bs / ap . if a collision occurs , i.e. , if the target bs / ap receives transmissions form more than one collaborative sets of sensor nodes , the bs / ap approves only one set of nodes for data transmission .",
    "* at the beginning of each following time - slot , the bs / ap broadcasts through the control channels the selected source i d in addition to one bit of information which indicates that the bs / ap is busy . in this case",
    ", other source nodes are not allowed to transmit data to the same bs / ap .",
    "* finally , only the predetermined subset of collaborative nodes @xmath65 assigned to the pair @xmath7@xmath8 continues to receive data , while other nodes go back to idle mode , that is , the actual data transmission takes a place for the pair @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "a set of collaborative nodes @xmath68 is assigned to each source  distention pair @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "to select such a collaborative set , the nodes can be tested one by one or a group of nodes by a group of nodes .",
    "the latter is , however , preferable since it can significantly reduce the data overhead in the system .",
    "indeed , while testing one node or a group of nodes , we need to check if the corresponding cb beampattern sidelobe level reduces in the unintended direction(s ) and then send the ` approve / reject ' bit per one node in the fist case , or per a group of nodes in the second case . therefore",
    ", if every group of nodes consists of a larger number of sensor nodes , less ` approve / reject ' bits has to be sent in the system in total .",
    "consider the source node @xmath69 , let the number of nodes in its coverage area is @xmath70 , the number of collaborative nodes needed to be selected is @xmath71 , and the size of one group of nodes to be tested in each trial is @xmath72 .",
    "using the selection principle highlighted above , the selection process can be organized in the following two steps .    *",
    "* selection .",
    "* source node @xmath69 initiates the node selection by broadcasting the _ select message _ to the nodes in its coverage area , namely the set @xmath73 , and randomly selects a subset @xmath74 of @xmath75 candidate nodes from @xmath59 .",
    "+ the nodes can be assigned to the set @xmath74 by using any of the following two methods .",
    "the first one is a centralized method in which the source node @xmath69 is totally responsible for the node assignment . according to this method ,",
    "every source node maintains a table of ids of all candidate nodes in its coverage area and randomly assigns nodes to the set @xmath76 .",
    "the source node @xmath69 then broadcasts the ids of the nodes assigned to the set @xmath74 to inform them that they are selected for the test .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that it is suitable only for small wsns where each source node can keep records of all other nodes in its coverage area . as a result",
    ", this method typically requires large data exchange between the source and the candidate nodes .",
    "+ alternatively , in the second method , node assignment task is distributed among the source and collaborative nodes .",
    "in particular , if collaborative nodes receive the _ select message _ , each node starts a random delay using an internal timer .",
    "after the random delay , the candidate node responds by the _ offer message _ which contains the i d of this node .",
    "then the source node responds by the _ approval message _ which requires only 1 bit of feedback .",
    "if a collision occurs and two collaborative nodes transmit the _ offer message _ at the same time , the source node responds by the _ approval message _ with a different bit value and the timers in both nodes start over a new random delay .",
    "the process repeats and the source node @xmath69 keeps sending the _ select message _ until @xmath75 candidate nodes are assigned and the set @xmath74 is constructed .",
    "* the set @xmath74 transmits the _ test message _ that contains the intended bs / ap i d to the intended destination @xmath48 using cb .",
    "while the intended destination @xmath48 receives a predetermined _ signal _ power level , the _ interference _ power levels at the unintended destination(s ) @xmath8 , @xmath77 are random because of the random sidelobes of the cb beampattern . at this stage ,",
    "all unintended bss / aps with different ids measure the received inr @xmath67 . if @xmath67 is higher than a predetermined threshold value @xmath78 , the _ reject message _ is sent back to the candidate set @xmath79 . in this case",

    ", we can avoid an overlap between sets of nodes serving different bss / aps .",

    "in this section , we analyze the proposed node selection algorithm in terms of ( i )  the average number of trials required for selecting a set of collaborative nodes which guarantee low interference level for unintended bss / aps and ( ii )  the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) of the inr @xmath67 .",
    "the first characteristic allows to estimate the average run time of the algorithm , while the second characteristic is needed to estimate the achievable interference levels versus the corresponding interference threshold values .",
    "note that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , denoted as @xmath93 , received through the link @xmath69@xmath48 at the intended bs / ap should be above a certain level which guarantees the correct detection with high probability .",
    "this snr at the intended bs / ap must be guaranteed regardless of the number of collaborative nodes participating in the cb .",

    "if the snr at the intended bs / ap is required to be @xmath94  db , then in the selection process , the power per one sensor node in @xmath90 has to be set as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the maximum available power at the node .",
    "also note that the power consumed for running the node selection algorithm is , in fact , proportional to the average number of trials in the algorithm .",
    "therefore , it is preferable to construct a set of collaborative nodes with less number of trials .    in order to derive the average number of trials for the node selection algorithm ,",
