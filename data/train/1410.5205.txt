    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are accreting compact objects with luminosities exceeding the eddington limit @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the mass of the accreting object , @xmath4 is the mass of the proton , @xmath5 is the speed of light , @xmath6 is the gravitational constant and @xmath7 is the thomson cross - section for scattering of photons from electrons ) for a @xmath8 object ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "they possibly form a heterogeneous family with sub - classes @xcite . some of these objects reach luminosities @xmath9  erg  s@xmath2 appropriate for @xmath10 under the assumption of accretion at the eddington limit .",
    "such objects are puzzling as they can not form by stellar evolution and are dubbed intermediate mass black holes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they are proposed to be stellar mass black holes accreting at rates slightly exceeding the eddington limit @xcite and appear to be super - eddington due to anisotropic emission .",
    "the recent identification @xcite of nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   in the nearby galaxy m82 with a neutron star accreting in a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) challenged the view that all ulx harbour black holes .",
    "the luminosity of the object is @xmath12  erg  s@xmath2 during pulsations and reaches @xmath13  erg  s@xmath2 at the peak flux under the assumption of isotropic emission . as a neutron star can not have a mass exceeding @xmath14 @xcite this super - eddington luminosity is attributed by @xcite to fan beam geometry @xcite viewed at a favourable angle .",
    "an alternative explanation obviating the assumption of favourable viewing angle though not necessarily rejecting that the emission is anisotropic , is that the magnetic field is so strong that the scattering cross - section reduces @xcite as is the case for magnetars @xcite .",
    "this explanation is not preferred by @xcite as they infer the magnetic dipole field of the neutron star to be @xmath15  g from the observed spin - up rate assuming accretion at the eddington rate .",
    "this value for the magnetic field inferred by @xcite is not consistent with the assumption of the system being near torque equilibrium because the torque for a system near equilibrium is vanishingly small and leads to an underestimate of the magnetic field if its full value is employed . a magnetic field as low as @xmath15  g is also not consistent with the presence of fan beam geometry .",
    "an increase in the critical luminosity by beaming is easier to achieve with a field of the order of @xmath16  g @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we show that the pulsar in nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   has a dipole magnetic field of at least @xmath17  g  in the range of low - magnetic field magnetars @xcite  and possibly of @xmath18  g in excess of the quantum critical limit , @xmath19  g , and argue that it could have even stronger magnetic fields in the higher multipoles @xcite .",
    "such strong fields increase the critical luminosity either by releasing the energy via magnetohydrodynamic waves @xcite or by the reduction of the scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "this relates at least some of the ulxs with isolated magnetars and supports the recent view that magnetars descent from hmxbs @xcite . in the following section we estimate the magnetic field of the accreting neutron star in nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   and in  3 we discuss its astrophysical implications",
    "the x - ray luminosity due to accretion of matter onto a compact object is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "this implies @xmath22  g  s@xmath23 where @xmath24  erg  s@xmath2 , @xmath25  cm and @xmath26 .",
    "normally , this much luminosity would not be able to accrete onto the star because of the radiation pressure . yet",
    ", we assume the critical luminosity is increased beyond the eddington limit by the suppressed scattering cross - section of the electrons in strong magnetic field @xcite or by the transportation of energy via magnetohydrodynamic waves @xcite .     versus @xmath27 diagram @xcite for x - ray pulsars in",
    "be / hmxbs of small magellanic clouds @xcite ( sxps ) together with nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   where we used @xmath28 , @xmath29  s  s@xmath2 and @xmath30  erg  s@xmath2 @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the torque on the neutron star is @xmath31  g  @xmath32  s@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the moment of inertia in units of 10@xmath35  g  @xmath32 as inferred from the observed spin - up rate of @xmath36  s  s@xmath2 @xcite . as @xmath37  years the system should be near torque equilibrium so that the inner radius of the disc is close to the corotation radius @xmath38 .",
    "more specifically it will be @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the critical fastness parameter at which torque vanishes and is of order unity .",
    "the fastness parameter is defined as @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the measured period of the neutron star , @xmath28  s , implies that the co - rotation radius is at @xmath42 .",
    "the inner radius of the disc is thus at @xmath43 the inner radius of the disc is determined by the balance of magnetic and material stresses @xcite and scales with the alfvn radius @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a dimensionless number of order unity . equating the last two equations we find the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star as @xmath46 which , by @xmath47 , implies @xmath48 this value is an order of magnitude larger than that found by @xcite who use the measured torque to estimate the magnetic field . for @xmath49 ,",
    "favoured by @xcite , the field is found to be even larger , @xmath50  g , in excess of the quantum critical limit @xmath51 .",
    "the torque , however , is smaller than its nominal value @xmath52 @xcite as the system is near torque equilibrium .",
    "the nominal value should not be used for estimating the magnetic moment in this case as it would give a lowest estimate for the magnetic field .",
    "the torque acted by the disc , in general , is given as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dimensionless torque @xcite .",
    "any torque model near torque equilibrium would be of the form @xmath55 .",
    "this then would lead to the equation @xmath56 where we used @xmath57 .",
    "we solve this equation which is of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 numerically for the fastness parameter of the system and find @xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath28 , @xmath29  s  s@xmath2 and @xmath30  erg  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this indeed shows that the system is near torque equilibrium , but leads to a magnetic field @xmath62 times smaller than that inferred in .",
    "the above relations lead to @xmath63 @xcite for @xmath64 and this relation may be used as a diagnostic for understanding the accretion stage of nustar j09551@xmath116940.8 .",
    "accordingly , figure  [ fig1 ] shows nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   among x - ray pulsars in be / hmxbs of the small magellanic clouds ( sxps ) @xcite in a @xmath65 versus @xmath27 digram .",
    "the sxps in the data set of @xcite are the ones accreting from a disc rather than a wind .",
    "the ordinary position of nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   in the diagram also suggests that the object is indeed near torque equilibrium just like most of the sxps though nustar j09551@xmath116940.8is likely to accrete via roche - lobe overflow while sxp would be accreting from be discs .",
    "we have found that the dipole magnetic field of the pulsar nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   is at least @xmath66  g , an order of magnitude larger than that inferred by @xcite and possibly even stronger , @xmath0  g , in excess of the quantum critical magnetic field @xmath51 , if the inner radius of the disc is half of the alfvn radius .",
    "such a super - strong field is sufficient to lead to a reduction of the scattering cross - section and increase the critical luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the object has even stronger magnetic fields in the higher multipoles leading to even more effective increase of the critical luminosity enabling luminosities as large as @xmath67 .",
    "such strong fields are reminiscent of the magnetars @xcite in our own galaxy which are envisaged as isolated objects @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a scenario in which magnetars descent from hmxbs .",
    "the magnetic fields suggested for magnetars by these authors , however , is an order of magnitude lower than that estimated for nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   in the present paper .",
    "this implies that , if the scenario is correct , the magnetic field of nustar j09551@xmath116940.8   should decay during the process of transition to the isolated magnetar stage . the decay of the magnetic field of a neutron star by accretion is a process also invoked in the context of millisecond pulsars descending from low mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "there had been claims for the presence of accreting neutron stars with such strong magnetic fields in other hmxbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. ) though none had been caught in such a ultra - luminous state as nustar j09551@xmath116940.8 .",
    "also the neutron stars in these systems are accreting from the wind of the companion and have very long spin periods , @xmath68  s. more interestingly , magnetar - like behaviour from the peculiar binary ls  i  @xmath1161@xmath69303 is reported @xcite .",
    "the presence of such strong magnetic fields in some of these systems , however , has recently been questioned by @xcite who employed the quasi - spherical accretion model of @xcite .",
    "nustar j09551@xmath116940.8 , however , is very different from these systems with its much shorter period and much higher luminosity .",
    "for such strong magnetic fields the electron - cyclotron line would be beyond 500 kev which is undetectable by x - ray detectors .",
    "the proton - cyclotron lines have energies @xmath70  kev and could be detected by _ xmm - newton_. we would , however , like to note that no significant proton - cyclotron line had been detected in the persistent x - ray emission of isolated magnetars .",
    "hence the null result of such a search would not immediately rule out that the magnetic field of this object is of magnetar strength .",
    "the question naturally arises whether most if not all ulxs could be super - strongly magnetized accreting neutron stars . soon",
    "after this paper was submitted @xcite presented the null result of their search of pulsations through available archival _ xmm - newton _ observations of several ulx . at highest accretion rates the pulsar",
    "could be enshrouded and the pulsations could be smeared out by the optically thick surrounding medium .",
    "this may address the elusiveness of pulsations from other ulxs and may indicate to a larger population of neutron stars among ulxs .",
    "accordingly , ulxs at their lowest luminosity stage are better targets for detecting pulsations .",
