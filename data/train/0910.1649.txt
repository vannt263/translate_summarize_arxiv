    "in particular , we identify intervals of vanishing and non - vanishing for each homology group @xmath1 , and give asymptotic formulas for the expected rank of homology when it is non - vanishing .",
    "there are several motivations for studying this .",
    "the area of topological data analysis has been very active lately @xcite , and there is a need for a probabilistic null hypothesis to compare with topological statistics of point cloud data @xcite .",
    "one approach to this problem was taken by niyogi , smale , and weinberger @xcite , who studied the model where @xmath4 points are sampled uniformly and independently from a compact manifold @xmath5 embedded in @xmath0 , and estimates were given for how large @xmath4 must be in order to `` learn '' the topology of @xmath5 with high probability .",
    "their approach was to take balls of radius @xmath6 centered at the @xmath4 points and approximate the manifold by the ech complex ; provided that @xmath6 is chosen carefully , once there are enough balls to cover the manifold , one has a finite simplicial complex with the homotopy type of the manifold so in particular one can compute homology groups and so on .",
    "the main technical innovation in @xcite is a geometric method for bounding above the number of random balls needed to cover the manifold , given some information about the curvature of the manifold s embedding .",
    "the assumption here is that one already knows how large @xmath6 must be , or that one at least has enough information about the geometry of the embedding of @xmath5 in order to determine @xmath6 .",
    "( in a second article , they are able to recapture the topology of the manifold , even in the more difficult setting when gaussian noise is added to every sampled point @xcite .",
    "still , one needs some information about the embedding of the manifold . )    in this article we study both random vietoris - rips and ech complexes for fairly general distributions on euclidean space @xmath0 , and most importantly , allowing the radius of balls @xmath6 to vary from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "we identify thresholds for non - vanishing and vanishing of homology groups @xmath1 and also derive asymptotic formulas and bounds on expectations of the betti numbers @xmath9 in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is well understood in computational topology that persistent homology is more robust than homology alone ( see for example the stability results of cohen - steiner , edelsbrunner , and harer @xcite ) , and one might not know anything about the underlying space , so in practice one computes persistent homology over a wide regime of radius @xcite .",
    "there is also a close connection to geometric probability , and in particular the theory of geometric random graphs .",
    "some of our results are higher - dimensional analogues of thresholds for connectivity and component counts in random geometric graphs due to penrose @xcite , and we must also use penrose s results several times .",
    "however , an important contrast is that the properties studied here are decidedly non - monotone . in particular",
    ", for each @xmath10 there is an interval of radius @xmath6 for which the homology group @xmath11 , and with the expected rank of homology @xmath12 $ ] roughly unimodal in the radius @xmath6 , but we also show that for large enough or small enough radius , @xmath13 .    this paper can also be viewed in the context of several recent articles on the topology of random simplicial complexes @xcite .",

    "some of the results in this article may have been discovered concurrently and independently by other researchers ; it seems that yuliy barishnikov and shmuel weinberger have also thought about similar things @xcite . however , we believe that this article fills a gap in the literature and hope that it is useful as a reference .",

    "our results are for uniform distributions on smoothly bounded convex bodies in dimension @xmath20 .    in the supercritical regime , @xmath65 .",
    "we put an upper bound on @xmath12 $ ] to show that it grows sub - linearly , so the linear growth of the betti numbers in the critical regime is maximal . here",
    "our results are for the vietoris - rips complex , and the method is a morse - theoretic argument .",
    "the combination of geometric probability and discrete morse theory used for these bounds is the main technical contribution of the article .",
    "the connected regime , @xmath66 , is where @xmath23 is known to become connected @xcite . in this case",
    "we show that the ech complex is contractible and the vietoris - rips complex is approximately contractible , in the sense that it is @xmath10-connected for any fixed @xmath10 .",

    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : sub ] we consider the subcritical regime of radius , in section [ sect : crit ] the critical regime , in section [ sect : sup ] the supercritical regime , and in section [ sect : con ] the connected regime . in sections [ sect :",
    "sup ] and [ sect : con ] we assume that the underlying distribution is uniform on a smoothly bounded convex body mostly as a matter of convenience , but similar methods should apply in a more general setting . in section [",

    "( the case @xmath71 , the number of path components , is examined in careful detail by penrose @xcite , ch . 13 . ) as a corollary , we also obtain information about the threshold where homology passes from vanishing to non - vanishing homology .",
