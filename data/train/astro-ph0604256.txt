    "accurate astrometry and photometry of saturated and coronagraphic point spread functions ( psfs ) are fundamental to both ground- and space - based high contrast imaging of brown dwarfs and exoplanets . achieving precise astrometry",
    "is important to minimize the time required to confirm via proper motion analysis that two objects are gravitationally bound , i.e. that a newly found companion is not a background object , and to better constrain its orbit .",
    "precise photometry is essential to better understand the companion physical characteristics . for ground - based adaptive optics imaging , both standard",
    "observing techniques and more specialized observing methods , like simultaneous spectral differential imaging @xcite , angular differential imaging @xcite and coronagraphy @xcite , generally require the acquisition of a long sequence of images .",
    "the object airmass , the telescope orientation and the observing conditions ( seeing and sky transmission ) change during the sequence , producing point spread function ( psf ) flux and strehl ratio variations over time .",
    "the psf is also slowly moving and evolving due to flexure and differential atmospheric refraction if a near - infrared camera is used while operating the adaptive optics wavefront sensor in the visible .",
    "space - based imaging is also affected by similar problems from vibrations , thermal fluctuations and pointing jitters .",
    "if not corrected , these effects bias the relative photometry and astrometry of detected sources and the estimated sensitivity limits . to obtain the optimal signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and precise astrometry and photometry after combination of all acquired images , each individual image needs to be accurately registered and flux normalized .",
    "standard techniques to properly register a psf and to estimate the relative astrometry and photometry generally require the psf core .",
    "if the psf core is saturated to improve observing efficiency or if a non - transmissive focal plane occulter is used , the psf core is not visible and other techniques need to be applied . if available , an off - axis sharp ghost image can be used to register the psf and estimate its core position , but the possibility of a non - common motion between the ghost and the psf makes the registering uncertain .    the usual technique for estimating sensitivity limits ( or a source relative intensity ) when the psf core is saturated or occulted is to compare the noise in the combined image ( or a source peak intensity ) to the peak intensity of an unsaturated / unocculted psf acquired before and/or after the saturated / occulted image sequence .",
    "such estimates can be biased by the short exposure time and the generally small number of unsaturated / unocculted images .",
    "furthermore , the observing conditions of the unsaturated / unocculted images can be significantly different from those of the saturated / occulted image sequence .    to obtain the highest s / n ratio in the combined image , one would want , ideally , to normalize the images",
    "such that any point source , after image registration , has the same number of counts per full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in each image .",
    "the images would then be weighted by the inverse square of their noise and combined .",
    "a simple solution to these astrometric and photometric problems exists .",
    "a periodic phase or amplitude mask can be introduced at a pupil plane to produce fainter off - axis copies of the primary psf . the position and relative intensity of these satellite psfs are mainly fixed by the mask amplitude and spatial periodicity .",
    "these satellite psfs track precisely the psf core position as well as its intensity variations .",
    "they can thus be used for accurate astrometry and photometry .",

[ prec0 ] .",

    "[ perrin ] show symmetries or antisymmetries that can , in the presence of aberrations or mask shifts , slightly affect the psf center and intensity derived from the satellite psfs .",
    "the task of finding the dominant terms in different regimes is complicated by the fact that @xmath10 is complex ; the imaginary and real parts of terms in eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] and [ eq9 ] are not necessarily respectively antisymmetric and symmetric as in the unaberrated case .    for simplicity let us first consider the case without aberrations . in this case",

    "if @xmath13 is antisymmetric , the second term is zero and the first term is maximal ( astrometric error only ) , while if @xmath13 is symmetric , the first term is zero and the second term is maximal ( photometric error only ) .",
    "the symmetry of the mask is determined by its position in the pupil and may vary due to flexure or removal / reinsertion .",

    "the photometric precision is proportional to the ratio of the neglected term to the third term of eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] , or @xmath60 .",
    "the photometric precision is less sensitive to a mask offset when the satellite psfs are brighter .",
    "as mentioned previously , since @xmath10 is complex , the case with aberrations is much more complicated .",
    "astrometric and photometric errors can arise from both imaginary and real parts .",
    "furthermore , the residual symmetric and antisymmetric speckle noise from the psf will also influence the level of accuracy .",
    "intuitively , it is expected that brighter satellite psfs will result in a better astrometric and photometric precision .",
    "in previous sections , it was shown that periodic amplitude or phase masks can be used for astrometry and photometry calibration of saturated and coronagraphic psfs . in realistic conditions , the satellite psfs are overlaid over a background of speckle noise that can affect the determination of the satellite psfs centers and intensities .",
    "it is thus important to adjust the intensity of the satellites psfs to ensure that the desired accuracy is realized .",
    "since we have assumed that the speckle noise is limiting the astrometric and photometric precision , the sky background , detector read and photon noises are neglected .",
    "numerical simulations are now used to analyze the registering and photometric precision of the technique .",
    "each satellite psf is cross - correlated with a gaussian to determine its precise location .",
    "the average x and y positions of two symmetric satellite psfs are then used to derive the psf center .",
    "this derived position is then compared to the calculated psf center using the same cross - correlation algorithm on the psf core .",
    "relative intensities are simply obtained by taking the ratio of the satellite s peak intensity over that of the primary psf .",
    "the coronagraph was simulated by simply convolving the pupil by a gaussian having a fwhm equal to one quarter of the pupil diameter .",
    "the brightness of the satellite psfs was adjusted to 0.1% of the psf peak intensity , which correspond to 100 times the background speckle noise of an aberrated ( 150 nm rms ) non - coronagraphic psf .",
    "both the phase and amplitude sine phase masks are antisymmetric on the pupil while the grating is symmetric ( it is impossible to get a purely antisymmetric mask using a transmission amplitude grating ) .",
    "the first simulation is performed without aberration ( see table  [ tab0 ] ) . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ prec0 ] , only the phase mask shows astrometric errors when the mask is displaced while all mask types show small photometric errors .",
    "the use of a coronagraph attenuates interference terms and yields a better astrometric and/or photometric precision in all cases .",
    "twenty simulations using independent 150  nm rms phase aberrations were then realized for phase sine , amplitude sine and amplitude grating masks for both cases with and without the coronagraph .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the achievable registering and photometric precision .",
    "typically , an astrometric error of 0.3 pixels rms ( @xmath611/15 @xmath27 ) is found for both the non - coronagraph and the coronagraph cases .",
    "typical relative intensities are precise to less than 5% , enough for accurate flux normalization .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] presents the registering and photometric accuracies for the non - coronagraph and coronagraph cases using the sine wave amplitude mask for different satellite psf intensities relative to the local speckle noise .",
    "satellite psfs @xmath6110 times brighter than the speckle noise limit the psf registering accuracy to 1.2 pixels rms ( 1/3 @xmath27 ) and the photometric calibration to 15 - 20% , while satellite psfs being @xmath61100 times brigther than the background speckle noise limit the psf registering to 0.3 pixel rms ( @xmath611/15 @xmath27 ) and the photometric calibration to 5% .",
    "we note that both the astrometric and photometric precision increase as the square root of the ratio of the satellite psf intensity to the speckle noise background , i.e. @xmath60 if both the psf and mask are dominated by the second order halo term at the satellite psf separation . since this is the dependance that was found in sect .  [ prec0 ] for the unaberrated case , it is tempting to conclude that the second term of eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] introduces both astrometric and photometric errors , as was expected from the fact the @xmath10 is complex .    a satellite psf relative intensity of @xmath62 times the background speckle noise seems to be a good choice to avoid over - luminous satellite psfs while offering good registering and photometric accuracy ( 0.3 pixel rms ( @xmath611/15 @xmath27 ) and 5% ) .",
    "such an astrometric precision ( 0.003 arcsec for diffraction limited h - band images acquired with a 10-m telescope ) is sufficient to confirm proper motion of nearby systems ( typically 0.01 to 0.1 arcsec / year ) in one year",
    ". simulations also mean that companions need to be at least 100 times brighter than the background speckle noise to obtain 1/15  @xmath27 center determination accuracy and allow their proper motion follow - up in one year for typical nearby systems - fainter companions will require a bigger time interval or longer integration time , assuming that the object s / n is increasing with integration time . ] due to detector dynamic range limits , to minimize satellite psf intensities , it might be more convenient to use a large number of fainter satellite psfs to average the speckle noise bias , albeit at the cost of a greater fov contamination , or choose a mask frequency to move the satellite psfs to wide separations , where the speckle noise is generally smaller .",
    "a transmissive amplitude grating has been tested on the universit de montral high contrast imaging testbed .",

    "if we put a transmission amplitude grating just in front of altair s deformable mirror , where the wavefront diameter is 84  mm , a wire spacing and thickness of 2  mm and 18  @xmath70 m would respectively be required to produce satellite psfs 10 magnitudes fainter at 1.7 arcsec intervals .",

    "a potential solution is to increase the wire spacing to place the satellite psfs at 5  @xmath27 . using the same 18  @xmath29 m thick wires and wavefront diameter as the above example",
    ", it would produce satellite psfs that are 15 magnitudes fainter than the primary . for more advanced coronagraphic projects aiming for earth - like exoplanet detections at 24 magnitudes contrast ,",
    "a simple approach is to put the wires directly on the primary mirror .",
    "a series of ten 18 microns thick wires across an 8-m diameter telescope will produce satellite psfs 23.2 magnitudes fainter than the primary at 10 @xmath27 ( 99.998% transmission ) .",
    "another solution is to generate satellite psfs using a small periodic phase aberration . in a conventional adaptive optics system with a separate wavefront sensor",
    "this could be achieved by adding a sinusoidal offset to the control point that the wavefront sensor attempts to achieve .",
    "most ao systems operate with their wavefront control loop seeking not a flat wavefront in the sensor but a wavefront offset by the conjugate of any non - common - path aberrations between the wavefront sensor and science channel .",
    "adding an additional sinusoidal component to this offset would result in a time - averaged psf containing the satellite psfs .",
    "as long as the sinusoid is lower in amplitude than the typical residual wavefront , 200 - 300 nm for current ao systems @xcite and 50 - 100  nm for extreme ao @xcite , and the wavefront sensor is operating in a linear regime this should have little effect on other components of the image . for systems without a separate wavefront sensor - e.g. the terrestrial planet finder coronagraph , which intends to use science - camera images on a reference target to control the deformable mirror via iterative phase diversity , the satellite images could be built into the target wavefront or focal - plane image that the phase diversity image sequence converges to .",
    "the satellite psfs can then be used to estimate the psf changes between the reference and science targets .",
    "simulations presented in this paper are monochromatic . for bandpasses of finite size , off - axis satellite psfs will be elongated and thus fainter relative to the core .",
    "the satellite psf elongation is simply proportional to the filter bandpass @xmath71 times the satellite psf angular separation .",
    "additionally , for ground - based imaging , if no atmospheric dispersion corrector is used , the elongation of the satellite psfs will not necessarily points towards the psf center due to differential atmospheric refraction between the blue and red side of the bandpass @xcite . for h - band observations within @xmath72 ha , the amplitude of this effect can be several tens of mas , i.e. of the order of one @xmath27 , as observed by precise registration of two near - infrared narrow - band psfs made with the trident camera at cfht @xcite .",
    "however , satellite psf chromaticity and differential atmospheric refraction do not influence the astrometry precision since the midpoint of the line connecting the centers of opposite satellite psfs still coincides with the psf center . for large bandpasses and/or satellite psfs at large angular separations ,",
    "the satellite psf photometry can be partially correlated with a strehl ratio variation since the required aperture necessary to estimate the satellite psf intensity will need to be larger than a @xmath27 diameter ; it would thus be better to choose a satellite psf at small separation to minimize this effect .",
    "distortions coming from optics after the added mask can change the relative position of the satellite psfs .",
    "the satellite psf position will thus need to be calibrated using an internal source or on - sky observations . to obtain precise relative astrometry of detected companions , distortion corrections for the entire optical system is also required . for ground - based imaging ,",
    "two effects are potentially not correctable with the satellite psf technique .",
    "if a wide bandpass is used , spectral differences between the companion and the primary coupled with differential atmospheric refraction can introduce small astrometric errors as a function of airmass .",
    "this effect is negligible for ifus or narrowband imaging and can , for cases when it is important , be accounted for by analysis the companion spectrum .",
    "anisoplanatism variations can also degrade the companion strehl ratio without affecting that of the primary , thus possibly introducing companion photometric errors .",
    "since high contrast imaging projects usually have small fov ( several arcsec wide ) compared to standard ao anisoplanatism angle ( @xmath6130  arcsec radius ) , such effect is relatively small .",
    "the satellite psfs will occupy a small portion of the fov .",
    "once the psf is registered and flux normalized , they could be removed to avoid masking faint sources .",
    "since the angular separation and size of the satellite psfs is chromatic and fixed with respect to the instrument , a simple solution to remove them while conserving the flux of nearby sources would be to use the simultaneous spectral differential imaging ssdi @xcite and/or the angular differential imaging techniques adi @xcite . if such techniques still leave important localized residuals , the satellite psfs can simply be masked .",
    "it was shown both analytically and numerically that periodic amplitude and phase masks conjugated to the pupil plane with and without a coronagraph can be used to produce satellite psfs that track the psf core position and its intensity .",
    "the astrometric and photometric precision is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the satellite psf intensity to the background speckle noise .",
    "satellite psfs 100 times brighter than the speckle noise achieve a registering and photometric accuracy of @xmath73 pixel rms ( @xmath611/15 @xmath27 ) and 5% respectively .",
    "such a precision is sufficient to properly combine images and to confirm proper motion of nearby systems within one year with ao on a 10-m telescope .",
    "as illustrated by the laboratory experiment , this technique can be easily implemented by using a transmissive amplitude grating .",
    "the experiment has validated that an amplitude mask conjugated to the pupil plane produces such satellite psfs and that they track the psf core position and intensity while demonstrating the simplicity of the method .",
    "this technique could play an important role in current ao systems and next generation extreme adaptive optics coronagraph systems like the gemini planet imager @xcite or the vlt planet finder @xcite as well as in future high contrast coronagraphic space observatories .",
