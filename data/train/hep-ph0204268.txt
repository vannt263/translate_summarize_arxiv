    "as well known , the dis data in a broad kinematic region can be precisely described by a set of universal partonic distributions obeyed equations of the dglap - evolution @xcite at large virtualities @xmath5 .",
    "some difficulties appear when one tries to consider the heavy quark contribution into the function @xmath6 in the dgalp - technique .",
    "the problem is caused by an accurate account of the kinematic region @xmath7 , where , on one hand , we deal with high virtualities providing the applicability of pqcd , and , on the other hand , the mass effects should be appropriately treated and the heavy quarks can not be considered as massless . some attempts to take into account the heavy quarks contribution near the threshold and to match this contribution with the general dglap equations at large @xmath8 are presented in @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider @xmath9-quark production by making use of the notations in @xcite , where the attempt to match two different approaches for large @xmath5 and @xmath10 was done .",
    "the @xmath9-quark contribution into the structure function in the deep inelastic scattering can be obtained by convoluting the partonic distribution with the coefficient functions : @xmath11+\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + c_{c}(q^{2},\\mu ^{2})\\otimes f_{c}(\\mu ^{2})[x]+\\nonumber \\label{f2c } \\\\   &   & + c_{q}(q^{2},\\mu ^{2})\\otimes f_{q}(\\mu ^{2})[x],\\label{f2c } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denote the partonic densities in the proton , the symbol @xmath13 corresponds to the convolution over the variable @xmath14 : @xmath15=\\int _ { x}^{1}\\frac{dz}{z}a(z)b\\left ( \\frac{x}{z}\\right ) .\\ ] ]    at small @xmath16 the charm contents is @xmath17 , and the structure function @xmath18 is completely described by the photon - gluon fusion @xmath19 , that gives @xmath20 .",
    "the second term in ( [ f2c ] ) corresponds to the process of virtual photon scattering on the @xmath21-quark from the sea of the initial hadron . at large @xmath22 the process @xmath23",
    "becomes dominant .",
    "the process @xmath24 is usually not taken into account because its contribution is suppressed by the additional power of @xmath25 , however below we show that this process can play an essential role in the region of moderate @xmath26 and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the problem of matching the different approaches in the kinematic regions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , another important problem is connected to the comparison of theoretical predictions with the experimental data .",
    "so , @xmath29 is reconstructed in the zeus and h1 experiments @xcite over the @xmath30-meson production data obtained in two decay modes : @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33-meson production cross section is measured in the restricted kinematic region : at zeus one puts @xmath34  gev@xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37  gev , @xmath38 , while the h1 collaboration uses the similar kinematic region : @xmath39  gev , @xmath36 , @xmath40  gev , @xmath41 . the cross section in the whole kinematic region",
    "is reconstructed under some model assumptions of charm production .",
    "one can conclude that the really measured quantities are the spectra of the charmed mesons in the restricted kinematic region , but the @xmath9-quark ones .",
    "that is why one has to define a procedure of the charmed quark hadronization in order to compare the calculated function @xmath42 with the experiment .",
    "a procedure commonly used is based on the factorization theorem applied for the momentum spectrum of @xmath33-meson : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fragmentation function of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the form of @xmath47 is given by some kind of phenomenological anztze @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ frag ] ) should be a good approximation at large @xmath26 and @xmath48 , where the factorization theorem is valid .",
    "this theorem can not be applied to the whole kinematic region since this could generate essential errors in the relation between the @xmath33-meson and @xmath9-quark spectra .",
    "the drawback of ( [ frag ] ) is clearly seen in the h1 and zeus data : there is a visible excess of events in the region of pseudorapidity distribution towards the fragmentation of proton - beam .",
    "one can see the same features in the distribution over the variable @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are four - momenta of the proton , @xmath53-meson and virtual photon , correspondingly .",
    "the discrepancy between next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd prediction under the hadronization mechanism of ( [ frag ] ) and the experimental data is more essential at large @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "usually one tries to improve the data description by using some additional model assumptions incorporated in monte - carlo codes of event generator @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the model where the attempt to take into account the hadronization from the very beginning is done .",
    "let us consider the all pqcd @xmath56-diagrams , describing the perturbative production of the @xmath57-pair with the quantum numbers of the appropriate charm mesons .    a complete set of diagrams",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "1 . in this chapter",
    "our consideration is restricted by the case of @xmath33-meson production in the photon - gluon interaction @xmath58 ( see equation ( [ f2c ] ) ) .",
    "one needs the additional parameter @xmath59 to take into account the contribution by the simultaneous production of @xmath21 - and @xmath52-quarks .",
    "this parameter describes the fusion of @xmath9-quark and its light co - mover @xmath60 into @xmath61-system , and that is proportional to the @xmath33-meson wave function squared .",
    "this parameter can be extracted from the experimentally known value of the fragmentation probability @xmath62 of @xmath63 at large transverse momenta , @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61-system can be in two color states : octet or singlet . in our previous analysis of the data on the charm photoproduction and electroproduction @xcite we considered the production of color octet and color singlet states independently .",
    "so , we used two fusion parameters : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , correspondingly .",
    "the ratio of these values is close to unit . at small @xmath26 the color - singlet contribution into the cross section as well as",
    "the color - octet one behave as @xmath67 , and they are approximately equal to each other . at large @xmath26 both contributions",
    "behave like ( @xmath68 ) , and the singlet term is dominant .",
    "the color - singlet dominance takes place due to the color - coefficient ratio .",
    "the both contributions at large @xmath26 come to the fragmentation regime . in this regime",
    "the octet and singlet have a similar behavior , and the production process can be characterized by the only parameter : @xmath69 .",
    "a more detail description of the model is represented in the appendix .",
    "one of essential features of this model consists of obeying the factorization theorem at large transverse momenta .",
    "in other words , at large @xmath26 the formula of ( [ frag ] ) describes the process with a good approximation , and the process looks like a fragmentation . at small momenta",
    "the fragmentation form of the charm production is strongly broken by additional terms @xmath70 in contrast to the fragmentation term , which behaves like @xmath68 as follows from ( [ frag ] ) .",
    "one can see from fig . 2 how the factorization theorem works at large @xmath26 for both the singlet contribution and the octet one .",
    "the contributions of complete diagram - set ( fig .",
    "1 ) in comparison with the contribution of the fragmentation diagram one ( as in ( [ frag ] ) ) are presented in the figure for both the singlet and octet .",
    "the calculations have been done at rather large value of @xmath71gev@xmath35 in order to reach the factorization regime ( [ frag ] ) .",
    "one can see from the figure that there is the region of @xmath26 , where the fragmentation mechanism is not valid , and the contribution of perturbative recombination is dominant .",
    "the presence of the recombination contribution is due to the gauge invariance of qcd .",
    "the @xmath72-dependence of this contribution has the additional factor @xmath73 , that is why the recombination vanishes at large @xmath26 , and the @xmath53-meson production is described by the factorization formula of ( [ frag ] ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , the model under consideration has been used to describe the charm photoproduction data of zeus collaboration @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation probability @xmath75 was extracted from the experimental data on the @xmath33-meson production in @xmath76-annihilation @xcite .",
    "the value of factorization scale for the operators @xmath77 has been fixed at the @xmath33-meson mass : @xmath78 .",
    "the light quark mass equals @xmath79  gev , and the @xmath9 -quark mass equals @xmath80  gev .",
    "the factorization probability @xmath81 , while @xmath82  gev@xmath83 .",
    "the ratio between the octet and singlet operators has been chosen equal to @xmath84 .",
    "it is worth to mention that taking into account the color - octet contribution essentially improves the description of the experimental data , especially , in the description of the pseudorapidity distribution . in this distribution",
    "the octet enforces the production into the forward semisphere ( toward the direction of the initial proton ) and improves the data description in comparison with the nlo prediction @xcite .",
    "the calculations of cross section for the @xmath33-meson electroproduction have been made by practically the same manner as for the photoproduction .",
    "all we need is to replace the density - matrix of real photon by the density - matrix of virtual photon .",
    "so , after averaging over the photon and electron polarizations the @xmath33-meson elecroproduction amplitude squared has the following from : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath33-meson electroproduction amplitude squared , @xmath87 is the @xmath33-meson photoproduction amplitude ( @xmath88 is the lorentz index of the photon polarization ) , @xmath89and @xmath90 are the initial and final positron momenta , and @xmath91 .",
    "the calculation results are presented in figs . 3 and 4 in comparison with the experimental data of the h1 and zeus collaborations , correspondingly .",
    "the calculations have been done with the same cuts as in the appropriate experiments .",
    "the singlet contribution is plotted by the dashed curve , the octet contribution is plotted by the dotted curve ; the solid curve corresponds to the sum of these contributions .",
    "we have used two values of the scale for the running coupling constant of qcd in our calculations : @xmath92 ( upper curve ) and @xmath93 ( lower curve ) and the scale value @xmath94 for the cteq4 parameterization of the structure function . as one can see from the figures the model prediction is in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "such the good description is achieved due to taking into account the octet contribution .",
    "this contribution improves the distributions over the pseudorapidity @xmath95 ( as in the photoproduction ) ; over the variable @xmath96 measured in the h1 experiment , and over the variable @xmath97 measured in the zeus experiment ( @xmath98 is the @xmath53-meson 3-momentum in the c.m.s . of initial virtual photon and proton ) .",
    "it is worth to mention another feature of the octet contribution .",
    "it is essential at small @xmath26 and becomes negligible at large ones , where it is suppressed by the color - factor 1/8 .",
    "thus , in the framework of the model under consideration we have achieved a good description for the zeus charm - photoproduction data @xcite as well as for the charm - electroproduction data of h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite .",
    "this circumstance allows us to suppose that the extrapolation of the experimental data into the total kinematic region with the help of our model is rather reliable .",
    "it means , that we can calculate the total cross section production and , therefore , extract @xmath99 .",
    "the charm contribution @xmath99 into the structure function @xmath101 is defined by the doubly differential cross - section of the charm - production as follows : @xmath102 f_{2}^{c}-y^{2}f_{l}^{c}(q^{2},x)\\right\\}\\ ] ] generally one neglects the contribution of the longitudinal component @xmath103 because of its suppression .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , @xmath104 is reconstructed on the base of the experimental data for the @xmath105-meson production in the experimentally available kinematic region .",
    "the observed production cross section is extrapolated into the total kinematic region in the framework of some model .",
    "thus , it is clear that the @xmath106 value depends on a model . in the framework of our model",
    "we have an opportunity to calculate the cross section in the total kinematic region , determine @xmath0 , and compare it with the results of zeus and h1 collaborations .",
    "the experimental dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath14 for different @xmath22 values is shown in fig . 5 by dots ( the h1 collaboration ) .",
    "these data were extracted by the extrapolation of the experimentally observed cross section into the total kinematic region on the base of nlo calculations and monte - carlo programs taking into account the hadronization .",
    "the curves in this figure correspond to our model predictions .",
    "@xmath99 has been calculated according to formula ( [ f2csig ] ) .",
    "the falls on the distribution tails appear because of the phase - space borders for the given value of the @xmath107 -interaction energy and chosen values for the quark masses .",
    "the zeus experimental data on @xmath0 are shown in fig . 6 in comparison with the predictions of our model .",
    "one can see that the operator expansion of ( [ f2c ] ) contains not only the term interpreted as photon - gluon production of charm , but also that of describing the photon - quark production of charm .",
    "generally one neglects this term due to the additional factor of @xmath108 .    the diagrams , which correspond to the photon - quark term in our approach , are shown in fig .",
    "7 . for such kind of diagrams",
    "the only difference between the color - octet production cross section and the color - singlet one is due to the overall color factor of 1/8 .",
    "that is why we can restrict ourselves by considering the singlet production , only .",
    "the recent analysis demonstrates that at large transverse momenta @xmath26 the photon - quark production contribution is suppressed by an additional factor @xmath73 . at small @xmath26 the suppression",
    "is absent , and the differential cross section of the @xmath109 pair production at the angle @xmath110 ( toward the direction of initial quark @xmath52 ) has a large numerical coefficient in comparison with the @xmath9-quark production in the @xmath111-interaction @xcite : @xmath112    thus , the smallness of @xmath25 in the photon - quark production cross section is compensated by large numerical coefficient .",
    "to the same moment , the production at the angle @xmath113 is suppressed by the additional power of energy .",
    "another circumstance is essential , too : this contribution slightly depends on the light quark mass and does not vanish at @xmath114 .",
    "in paper @xcite the @xmath57-pair production cross section in the interaction of the photon and valence quark from the initial proton has been calculated to evaluate the @xmath115 and @xmath116 asymmetries .",
    "the predicted value of asymmetry in the kinematic regions researched by the zeus and h1 collaborations is about 2 - 3% , that is in the same order of magnitude as experimental errors . at low energies of @xmath117-interactions ,",
    "the role of the photon - quark production becomes essential and this contribution yields the asymmetry prediction which is in a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "if the production asymmetry is due to the perturbative recombination indeed , then the asymmetry decreases with the @xmath26 increase , because the perturbative recombination has the additional @xmath73 factor in comparison with the leading contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the asymmetry is due to the interaction between the @xmath21-quark and the valence quark from the initial hadron , then the interaction between the @xmath9-quark and the light quark from the initial hadron sea exists .",
    "such the contribution has been calculated in the framework of our model , and it surprisingly looks like the octet contribution in the distribution shape as well as in the absolute value .",
    "it is worth to mention that the quark - photon contribution does not contain an additional normalization factor , which the octet one contains . in fig .",
    "7 both the octet and quark - photon contributions into the @xmath33-meson production are presented for the kinematic region investigated by the h1 collaboration .",
    "one can see that the distributions over @xmath118 and @xmath26 are practically the same for the whole investigated range .",
    "one can see the only small difference in the normalization .",
    "the @xmath5-distributions at @xmath119 gev@xmath35 have practically the qualitatively similar behavior , too .",
    "the differences between the distributions over @xmath120 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are more essential for the production mechanisms compared .",
    "however , these distributions have qualitatively analogous behavior .",
    "the singlet @xmath121-pair yield in @xmath122- and @xmath123-interactions is presented in fig . 8 for the kinematic conditions of h1 experiment .",
    "it is clear from this figure that at not very large @xmath5 the sum of the @xmath124- and @xmath123-contributions into the singlet describes the data so good as the sum of @xmath122-contributions into the singlet and octet .",
    "therefore , the singlet @xmath57-pair production mechanism is enough to describe the charm photoproduction and electroproduction data in the hera experiments .",
    "the photon - gluon contribution as well as the quark - photon one play essential role for the singlet @xmath57-pair production at the hera interaction energy .",
    "the serious arguments to take into account the sea quark contribution into the charm production was presented in paper @xcite , where the charm production asymmetry has been successfully described in the framework of perturbative recombination in the e687 and e691 experiments .",
    "the model under consideration is based , at first , on the heavy - quark production in the perturbative theory , and second , it uses the nonperturbative model of quarks fusion into the hadron .",
    "this model allows us to describe the existing data on charm photoproduction and electroproduction in the total kinematic region .",
    "let us itemize the main features of the model predictions :    1 .   in the region of large transverse momenta of the @xmath125-pair",
    "our model predictions coincide with the predictions of the factorization model in form ( [ frag ] ) , or in other words , the momentum spectrum of @xmath57-pair is calculated by convolving the heavy quark spectrum with the fragmentation function . 2 .   in the region of small transverse momenta and small @xmath5",
    "the main contribution into the inclusive spectrum is due to the recombination diagrams , that depends on @xmath26 as @xmath126 , in contrast to the fragmentation ones , which depend on @xmath26 as @xmath127 .",
    "the contributions of @xmath128- and @xmath129-interactions into the charm production are comparable .",
    "it is not necessary to include the term @xmath130 of @xmath99 ( the second term in expansion([f2c ] ) ) into the data description at the hera energies .",
    "according to the paper @xcite the term @xmath130 becomes essential at large @xmath5 .",
    "therefore our main conclusion is formulated as follows : the spectator character of the @xmath33-meson production , which is independent of the flavor of the initial hadron remnant , becomes dominant at @xmath131 gev . at small transverse momenta",
    "the essential part of the cross section is due to the interaction with the initial hadron remnant .",
    "the interaction with the valence quark of the remnant explains the experimentally observed flavor asymmetry in the charm yield .",
    "we thank v. kiselev for useful discussions . this work was in part supported by the russian foundation for basic research , grants 01 - 02 - 99315 , 01 - 02 - 16585 and 00 - 15 - 96645 , the russian ministry on the education , grant e00 - 3.3 - 62 .",
    "in the framework of the tree level approach to the subprocess @xmath132 24 feynman diagrams contribute ( see fig . 1 ; he bold line corresponds to the @xmath9-quark , the thin line corresponds to the @xmath133-quark ) . in this paper",
    "the amplitude calculation has been done by straightforward multiplying of @xmath134-matrices , spinors and polarization vectors .",
    "let us introduce the following notations : @xmath135 the three - gluon vertex has the form @xmath136 the bi - quark currents are defined as follows : @xmath137 also we need to define the auxiliary spinors @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the polarization vectors of the gluon and photon , correspondingly .",
    "the matrix element squared is summed over the following ortonormalized states of gluon : @xmath141 it is worth to mention that @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is gluon momentum .    in the case of deep inelastic production",
    "the photon is off mass shell , and one need to replace the matrix @xmath145 in ( [ sub ] ) by the matrix @xmath146 .",
    "thus the matrix element will have a free lorentz index for convolving with the photon density in accordance with formula ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the contributions of the feynman diagrams into the total amplitude can be written as follows ( @xmath154 and @xmath155 are electric charges of the @xmath156- and @xmath157-quarks correspondingly ; the color coefficients are put into the braces ) :      the spinor states with the fixed spin projection on the axis @xmath159 have been chosen in the capacity of two independent spinor states . in our calculations ,",
    "the dirac representation for the @xmath134-matrices has been used .",
    "the spinor states can be written down as follows : @xmath160 the @xmath134-matrices in the dirac representation are given by @xmath161            [ [ b .- the - soft - process - of - boldsymbol - c -- and - boldsymbolbarq - quark - fusion - into - the - boldsymbol - cbarq - quarkonium ] ]   b. the soft process of @xmath170- and @xmath171-quark fusion into the @xmath172-quarkonium ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    to describe the fusion of @xmath9- and @xmath60-quarks into the @xmath61-quarkonium we suppose that there are terms in the partonic distribution of @xmath33-meson , which correspond to the valence quarks .",
    "we also suppose that the @xmath9- and @xmath60-quarks produced in the hard process transform into the valence quarks of the meson .",
    "the valence quark distributions in the system of infinite momentum have the following form :      for @xmath178 and @xmath179 the following equation is valid @xmath180 in our calculation we neglect the dispersion of the momentum fractions carried out by the quarks , or in other words , we consider ( [ valc],[vald],[valcd ] ) as absolutely precise equations .",
    "also we suppose that the light quark mass is about @xmath181 .    in the doubly heavy quarkonium",
    "the quark pair is in the singlet state , because the octet one is suppressed by the third power of the relative velocity of quarks @xcite . in the case of @xmath61-quarkonium",
    "this suppression does not exist , and one has to take into account the both color states .",
    "the operators @xmath65 and @xmath182 describing the hadronization of singlet and octet quark pairs into the meson are nonperturbative , because they include the interaction on the scale about @xmath183 . in the framework of nonrelativistic potential model",
