    "the decays of the @xmath6 lepton into hadrons are a very interesting subject in particle physics that has been a very active area of research during the last 25 years @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 is privileged because its mass allows it to decay hadronically while being a lepton , which means a clean place to scrutinize hadronization effects at low - energies , where qcd becomes nonperturbative .",
    "one can exploit this advantage to a great extent through its inclusive decays @xcite .",
    "however we will focus in what follows in one of its exclusive decays .",
    "+ the decay amplitude for the one meson radiative decays of the @xmath6 includes an internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) component , that is given by qed , and thus can be calculated unambiguously to any desired order in perturbation theory . in addition , one has the structure dependent ( sd ) part , dominated by the effects of the strong interaction and the interference ( int ) between both .",
    "lorentz symmetry determines that there are two independent structures , the so - called vector ( v ) and axial - vector ( a ) form factors that encode our lack of knowledge of the precise mechanism responsible for hadronization .",
    "+ we consider the @xmath7 process .",
    ", which is related to it via chiral symmetry , is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which this proceeding is based . ]",
    "the kinematics of this decay is equivalent to that of the radiative pion decay @xcite .",
    "we will use @xmath8 . in complete analogy to that case @xcite , the matrix element for the decay of @xmath9 can be written as the sum of four contributions : @xmath10     = \\mathcal{m}_{ib_\\tau } + \\mathcal{m}_{ib_\\pi } + \\mathcal{m}_{v } + \\mathcal{m}_{a}\\,,\\,\\ ] ] with ) , in which we have detected  @xcite several typoes . ]",
    "@xmath11 l^\\mu , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the electric charge of the positron and @xmath13 is the polarization vector of the photon . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the so called @xmath16 form factors . finally @xmath17 and @xmath18 are lepton currents defined by @xmath19 the notation introduced for the amplitudes describes the four kinds of contributions : @xmath20 is the bremsstrahlung off the tau , ( figure [ diagrams general decomposition amplitude in radiative decays tau with one meson](a ) ) ; @xmath21 is the sum of the bremsstrahlung off the @xmath22 ( figure [ diagrams general decomposition amplitude in radiative decays tau with one meson](b ) ) , and the seagull diagram ( figure [ diagrams general decomposition amplitude in radiative decays tau with one meson](c ) ) ; @xmath23 is the @xmath16 vector contribution ( figure [ diagrams general decomposition amplitude in radiative decays tau with one meson](d ) ) and @xmath24 the @xmath16 axial - vector contribution ( figure [ diagrams general decomposition amplitude in radiative decays tau with one meson](e ) ) .",
    "our ignorance of the exact mechanism of hadronization is parametrized in terms of the two form factors @xmath15 and @xmath25(t ) .",
    "in fact , these form factors are the same functions of the momentum transfer @xmath26 as those in the radiative pion decay , the only difference being that @xmath26 now varies from @xmath27 up to @xmath28 rather than just up to @xmath29",
    ".        the dimensionless variables @xmath30 allow to measure the photon and pion energies in units of @xmath31 in the tau rest frame .",
    "their kinematical boundaries are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 so that the photon spectrum will extend up to @xmath34 .",
    "in the decay @xmath35 the photon energy would be fixed to @xmath36 so one could expect some contamination of the decay @xmath9 to @xmath35 , with the @xmath22 misidentified as a @xmath37 . the invariant mass of the @xmath22-@xmath38 system will vary in the range @xmath39 when the other independent kinematical variable is taken as @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "tau lepton decays probe qcd in its non - perturbative regime where standard expansions in powers of the coupling constant are no longer applicable .",
    "however , the chiral symmetry of the massless theory allows to build an effective field theory dual to qcd in the light - meson sector , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "this will not be enough , since @xmath26 can reach @xmath28 , which is far beyond the region of applicability of @xmath42 . still , the low - energy region of semileptonic tau decays is well described by the @xmath42 results  @xcite .",
    "then , one should envisage a way of enlarging the range of applicability of @xmath42 while respecting its low - energy behaviour .",
    "the limit of a large number of colors ( @xmath43 ) in qcd @xcite is a useful tool in the development of resonance chiral theory ( @xmath44 ) @xcite , a lagrangian formulation including the resonances as dynamical degrees of freedom that preserves assymptotic qcd properties @xcite , @xcite .",
    "remarkably , @xmath44 was capable of predicting the low - energy constants ( lecs ) of @xmath42 in terms of resonance masses and couplings .",
    "the phenomenological application of the theory ( in the @xmath45 limit ) to study two-@xcite and three - meson decays of the @xmath6 @xcite has been successful and several green - functions @xcite , @xcite and associated form factors have been studied within it over the years .",
    "+ the leading action of the @xmath44 lagrangian includes the @xmath46 @xmath42 in the even - intrinsic parity sector and the leading @xmath47 @xmath42 ( given by the wess - zumino - witten term @xcite ) in the odd - intrinsic parity sector .",
    "higher - order pieces in the chiral expansion are assumed to be generated by the integration of the resonances ( this was checked to occur at @xmath47 for the @xmath48 couplings of @xmath44 @xcite ) . +",
    "next , one adds all pieces including resonances ( r ) and chiral tensors with low enough chiral order ( @xmath49 ) to not violate high - energy conditions or to force fine - tuned cancellations among the relevant couplings to fulfil the short distance constraints . in the odd - intrinsic - parity sector , that contributes to the vector form factor , this amounts to include all terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for the even - intrinsic - parity operators that are contributing to the axial - vector form factors , these are the terms of @xmath52 . since previous analysis showed the relevance of the @xmath53 with negative intrinsic parity we will consider them here , as well . all mentioned pieces of the lagrangian",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the expressions for the @xmath16 form factors in @xmath54 decays . in figs .",
    "[ fig.pi.a ] and [ fig.pi.v ] the feynman diagrams contributing to these form factors are displayed .",
    "the thick dots represent strong vertices .    ]    ]     + we provide the resonances with an adequate energy - dependent width obtained consistently within @xmath1 @xcite and consider only one resonance multiplet per set of quantum numbers ( the contribution of spin - zero resonances is suppressed by conservation laws and the fact that there is only one meson in the final state ) .",
    "since this process has not been measured yet , one should try the simplest possible description ( in order to be predictive ) that can eventually be completed if the data require so .",
    "+ next we require a brodsky - lepage @xcite behaviour to the vector form factor and demand that the axial - vector form factor satisfies a once subtracted dispersion relation .",
    "this results in constraints among the lagrangian couplings .",
    "noteworthily , the relations found in the @xmath55 decays are all consistent with those obtained in the @xmath6 decays into two and three mesons .",
    "there is only one relation that differs with respect to the study of the vector - vector - pseudoscalar green s function @xcite for a coupling whose impact is very mild and the discrepancy is less than @xmath56 .",
    "first we have assessed the importance of the model independent contributions , meaning the @xmath57 described by qed and the wess - zumino - witten contribution to the vector form factor , that is determined from qcd .",
    "we have thus switched off the remaining contributions to the vector form factor and the whole axial - vector form factor in this first step .",
    "we find that for a cut on the photon energy of @xmath2 mev , it amounts to @xmath58 of the non - radiative decay , namely a branching fraction of @xmath3 .",
    "next , we include also the model dependent contributions , obtained as described in sect .",
    "[ theory ] .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ all ] we show the differential decay width of the process @xmath59 including all contributions as a function of @xmath60 , i.e. the photon energy in the tau rest frame and in fig .",
    "[ sd ] we display the @xmath16 contributions , that are enhanced near the endpoint region , where the process @xmath0 can contaminate the decay @xmath5 .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that for a realistic cut on the photon energy ( around @xmath2 mev ) this mode gives a branching ratio of roughly @xmath3 that should have already been detected at the heavy - flavour factories .",
    "notwithstanding , this decay mode has not been measured yet .",
    "this does not mean that the detection of soft photons at b - factories is not as good as estimated , but that the splitting of the radiative and non - radiative pion decay of the tau was not considered a priority . + according to the last report by the belle  @xcite collaboration , the main source of background in @xmath5 searches is the process @xmath0 , where the pion is miss - identified as a muon .",
    "this decay represents up to @xmath61 of all background and the pion fake probability to be detected as a muon is @xmath62 .",
    "however , the most important contribution to this background would come from radiation off the @xmath63 pair and not off the @xmath22 or @xmath6 . the background related to the decay @xmath0 is estimated using photos @xcite that only incorporates the model independent contributions from qed to @xmath0 , i.e. the ib parts in eq.([mtot ] ) . for low photon energies ,",
    "this decay is dominated by the ib parts and is detected as @xmath64 , since the photon can not be resolved .",
    "however , we have seen in fig . [ all ] , that for large photon energies the dominant contribution is given by the @xmath16 terms .",
    "indeed , it is precisely near the endpoint of the photon decay spectrum where it is easier that the miss - id happens , since in the two body - decay @xmath5 , @xmath65 , and the correction is @xmath66 , while in @xmath0 the photon energy spectrum extends essentially to the same value and the correction here is given by @xmath67 , see eq .",
    "( [ r_pi2 ] ) .",
    "+ we compare our prediction for the photon spectrum in @xmath0 with what is obtained with photos @xcite and mc - tester @xcite runned with fixed first order only ( similar results are obtained with exponentiation on ) , as it is displayed in fig .",
    "[ comparison1 ] . + in order to assess the impact of the @xmath16 effects in that background estimation , one needs to compare photos and our prediction for the case where the @xmath22 and @xmath38 energies reconstruct the @xmath6 mass up to 9 mev of difference .",
    "we do this in fig .",
    "[ comparison2 ] , where this missing mass is distributed evenly between the @xmath22 and the @xmath38 and only the relevant region near the endpoint is displayed in order to better appreciate the differences .",
    "the photos simulation was obtained with 100mevents generated for @xmath68 where @xmath69 corresponds to the radiative decay .",
    "we see that in the last six bins there is only one event .",
    "we can estimate -rather conservatively- the difference between our prediction and photos by taking the integral over these last six bins , where we will estimate the photos contribution by our prediction including only @xmath57 .",
    "this gives a ratio of @xmath70 , as the underestimation of background due to the @xmath16 effects we have studied .",
    "+    nevertheless , we stress that the total decay width is mildly affected by the @xmath16 parts so that the global description provided by photos is good . for example , for the total decay width",
    "one has @xmath71 our estimations ( factor of 5 more background due to the considered decay that obtained with photos ) would imply that this source of background could affect the present upper bounds in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite:@xmath72 at @xmath73 @xmath74 , making them even stronger .",
    "the new version @xcite of hadronic currents in tauola @xcite and the inclusion on photos of our current in the line of ref .",
    "@xcite will be the ideal tools to estimate reliably this background .",
    "we have analyzed the decay @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out essential to measure the photon energy spectrum near the endpoint in order to assess the real background affecting the lepton flavour violating decay @xmath5 , and the upper bound for its branching ratio .",
    "moreover , it would be an interesting tool for lepton universality tests through the ratio @xmath75/@xmath76 .",
    "to our view this decay channel should no longer be regarded as attached to the @xmath64 measurement for energetic enough photons which would allow experimental resolution .",
    "therefore , it would become a golden mode to be searched for by the ( super)b and tau - charm factories in the near future .",
