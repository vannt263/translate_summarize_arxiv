    "rich clusters of galaxies , such as the abell clusters , are filled with @xmath5  of hot ( @xmath6 ) x - ray emitting gas ( see , e.g. , fabian , nulsen , and canizares 1991 ) .",
    "the density of this gas is largest in the central region ( 0.1 - 0.001 @xmath7 ) and decreases with radius , where it becomes undetectable to x - ray instruments when n@xmath8 @xmath7 ( typically at radii of 1 - 3 mpc ; h@xmath9 mpc@xmath10 throughout ) . although studies of cluster gas have focused on the hot medium , three important processes can produce cool gas ( @xmath11@xmath12 k ) in rich clusters of galaxies : stripping of galactic gas by the hot ambient medium ; infall of cool gas into the cluster ; and the radiative cooling of the hot gas in the cluster core ( cooling flows ) .",
    "the stripping of galactic gas is expected to be the main process by which the cluster gas becomes enriched , so it is central to interpreting cluster metallicities .",
    "the rate at which gas is removed from the ensemble of galaxies is @xmath13  yr@xmath10 soker , bregman , and sarazin 1991 ) , this gas should be near solar metallicity , and the stripping should occur in the inner 1 mpc of the cluster , where the ambient medium is densest ( gaetz , salpeter , and shaviv 1987 ) .",
    "the infall of gas onto clusters occurs at the outer regions ( 3 mpc radius ) , it will involve low metallicity material , and the infall rate is expected to be @xmath14  yr@xmath10 .",
    "the growth rate of the cluster by infalling gas is a prime growth mechanism for clusters .",
    "finally , in the central 100 kpc , clusters with cooling flows are believed to deposit cooled gas of approximately 1/3 solar metallicity and at the rate of @xmath13  yr@xmath10 .",
    "each of these mechanisms is distinct both in the spatial distribution for the absorption and in the metallicity of the gas .",
    "this paper is the first in an effort to study this cooled gas through the presence of absorption lines .",
    "there have been studies at a variety of wavebands in an effort to detect cool gas .",
    "direct detection of hi in absorption and emission have met with some success , although large quantities of gas are not discovered , and co emission remains undetected ( mcnamara , bregman , and oconnell 1990 ; mcnamara and jaffe 1994 ; odea , baum , and gallimore 1994 ; odea et al . 1994 ; odea , gallimore , and baum 1995 ; odea , payne , and kocevski 1998 ) .",
    "indirect evidence for cool gas has been obtained by far infrared studies that are sensitive to thermal reemission from dust , where weak emission is seen in a minority of galaxy clusters ( maoz 1995 ; cox , bregman , and schombert 1995 ; stickel et al .",
    "large amounts of cooled gas ( @xmath15 ) are inferred from the excess soft x - ray absorption toward the central regions ( within @xmath16 mpc ) of cooling flow clusters ( white et al .",
    "1991 ; allen et al .  1993 ; fabian et al.1994 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "1995 ) , although this result has been questioned ( arabadjis and bregman 1999 ) .",
    "cooled material is detectable through uv and optical absorption line studies against background point sources . in a recent study ,",
    "koekemoer et al .  (",
    "1998 ) searched for absorption against a quasar associated with the central galaxy of abell 1030 .",
    "no lines were detected and they obtain 1-@xmath1  upper limits on the column density for a number of species , including hi ( @xmath17 @xmath4 ) , mgii ( @xmath18 @xmath4 ) , and feii ( @xmath19 @xmath4 ) . in another study , toward ngc 1275 in perseus ( johnstone and fabian 1995 ) , there is a dip in the middle of the  emission line at the velocity of the 21 cm hi absorption feature , which may be interpreted as  absorption with an equivalent width in the 1 - 5 range .",
    "however , johnstone and fabian ( 1995 ) interpret the  emission line as being double but without absorption , which illustrates the difficulty of analyzing emission and absorption features at the same redshift .",
    "the problem with using an agn in the center of a cluster is that if absorption is detected , it is difficult to distinguish absorption in the agn from cluster absorption .",
    "alternatively , a failure to detect absorption might be due to the strong photoionizing influence of the agn on the cool gas .",
    "both problems are avoided by detecting cool icm gas through absorption against background agns which are unrelated to the cluster .",
    "this technique has the desirable feature that the cluster and background source are well separated in velocity space , allowing clean identification of spectral features from each .",
    "in addition , the path length covers the entire cluster , thereby maximizing the likelihood of detection .",
    "we have obtained near - uv spectra of five background qsos behind different clusters , supplemented by an additional qso spectrum from the hst archive . with these six independent lines of sight at various distances from the cluster cores ,",
    "we have searched for low ionization metal resonance lines .",
    "the background agns were identified by us as part of a program to find continuum point sources positioned behind galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( knezek and bregman 1998 ) .",
    "our procedure was to use archived rosat x - ray images of nearly sixty northern hemisphere clusters and identify point sources , many of which are background agns .",
    "we obtained optical spectrophotometry of the sources with the mdm 2.4 m telescope , and when agns were confirmed through their emission line spectra , we determined their redshifts , fluxes and spectral shapes .",
    "the confirmed agns were screened by brightness , redshift , reddening , and projected distance from the cluster center , and the best targets were chosen for observation with hst .",
    "in particular , to allow for unambiguous detection of the mgii @xmath20 doublet , we limited the redshift to @xmath21 . at redshifts greater than this , the ly@xmath22  forest",
    "is shifted past the mgii doublet , which could cause false detections ( this is a problem for the sixth target , taken from the archive , as it has @xmath23 ) .",
    "the final sample is unbiased and representative of clusters as a whole , as our selection of agns samples a range of projected radii and x - ray properties .",
    "two of the agns lie within the inner one - fifth of the cluster radius , while the other four lie between 0.30.72 @xmath24 . with regards to the x - ray properties ,",
    "one of the clusters , abell 1795 , exhibits a very large cooling rate while abell 754 has a more modest flow .",
    "two of the clusters , abell 21 and coma , show no evidence of cooling flows .",
    "the remaining two , abell 151 and abell 1267 , do not have public x - ray data , although they are nearby and should be bright . finally , our sample is unbiased by the selection of agns , since these background sources are completely uncorrelated to the clusters themselves .",
    "the data for this project were obtained with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) .",
    "each spectrum was taken through the 0.86  circular aperture using the g270h grating and red digicon detector . in this configuration ,",
    "the spectrum covers the 22223277   range , and the expected fos instrumental line width ( fwhm ) is 2.04  , which produces a spectral resolution of 219  at 2800  .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 , which lists the date and exposure time for each observation , as well as characteristics of each qso and cluster .",
    "five of the observations were obtained for this program .",
    "the sixth , qso 1258@xmath25285 behind the coma cluster , was obtained from the hst data archives to increase our sample .",
    "additional ghrs spectra in the far - uv were also retrieved , but were found to be of poor quality for this project .",
    "each data set was recalibrated with the calfos routine in the iraf / stsdas package , using the best reference files available .",
    "this produced a substantial improvement ( about a factor of 1.5 ) in the signal - to - noise over the initial pipeline processing .",
    "the calibrated spectra along with the propagated photon counting errors are shown in figure 1 ; important qso emission lines are marked .",
    "the identification of absorption lines and measurement of their strengths were performed using the hst absorption line key project software ( schneider et al .",
    "first , a qso `` continuum '' was fit to each spectrum with a series of spline curves .",
    "this fit included the qso emission lines to allow detection of absorption lines superimposed on these features ; each spectrum and associated error array was normalized to unity .",
    "the line - searching software takes as input parameters the maximum gaussian width ( fwhm ) , detection limit ( defined in terms of the significance level of the measured equivalent width ) , and the psf characteristics .",
    "the software performs both psf and gaussian fitting to the input spectrum , applying multiple gaussians in the case of blended features .",
    "( a detailed description of the line - searching algorithm is provided by schneider et al .",
    "we constrained the fwhm of an absorption line to lie between the instrumental limit and that corresponding to a velocity dispersion of 1000 , which is greater than the velocity dispersion of these clusters .",
    "a detection threshold of 3-@xmath1 was used .",
    "several lines were detected in each spectrum , and these are listed in table 2 along with their measured equivalent widths and our identifications .",
    "the strong galactic lines of feii ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) , mgii ( @xmath31 ) , and mgi ( @xmath32 ) appear in every spectrum , with line strengths ranging from 0.2   for the mgi line to about 1.0   for the stronger line of the mgii doublet ( figure 1 ; all wavelengths are in vacuum . )",
    "analysis of the galactic features sheds some light on the quality of the wavelength calibration .",
    "the wavelength zeropoint of fos was not constant between observations , but varied as a result of non - repeatability of the filter / grating wheel position , in addition to other effects .",
    "since contemporaneous wavelength calibration data were not taken with any of the object spectra , the wavelength zeropoint could be be displaced by as much as 250 ( keyes , hst handbook ) .",
    "indeed , the line centers of the galactic lines are shifted from rest by as much as @xmath33   ( @xmath34 ) in our spectra .",
    "since it is impossible to separate true galactic motion from errors in the wavelength zeropoint , we have adopted the convention of the hst key project team and have shifted each spectrum so that the milky way lines are at rest , using the strong feii and mgii lines as reference . all figures and data reported in this paper reflect this adjustment .",
    "in addition to the galactic lines , several other features have been identified in the spectra , and are described below .",
    "no sets of lines within @xmath35  of the cluster redshift were identified for any of the clusters .",
    "the spectra in figure 1 show the regions in which we would expect to see the mgii or feii absorption produced by cool cluster gas .    to detect fainter absorption features , we searched each spectrum using a detection threshold of 1.5-@xmath1 .",
    "detected lines falling within the expected regions were compared in velocity and line strength to see if they were plausible components of the same species .",
    "no satisfactory matches were made .",
    "we see absorption by several systems which are unrelated to the intervening abell clusters or to the galaxy .",
    "_ qso 0107@xmath36156 _ : we observe a @xmath37 absorption line at 2244.8  , superimposed on the qso ly@xmath22  emission line .",
    "this could be due to an hi cloud in the agn itself , in which case the cloud would be outflowing at @xmath361630  relative to the qso .",
    "this spectrum contains two additional absorption lines that are more difficult to identify : @xmath38    at 2397.5   and @xmath39    at 2402.0  . in the rest frame of the cluster",
    ", these lines would fall at 2277.7 and 2282.0  , respectively ; in the rest frame of the qso , they would be 1739.8 and 1743.1  .",
    "there are no known resonance lines at these wavelengths .",
    "if this absorption were due to intervening material , e.g. from feii @xmath27 or @xmath40 , we would expect to see absorption elsewhere in the spectrum from species in a similar ionization state .",
    "( in the example , feii @xmath30 would fall in the range 26152630   and have @xmath41  ; the 1-@xmath1 equivalent width limit , found below , is 0.06   in this region of the spectrum . )",
    "the most likely identification for this pair of lines is the c iv doublet at 1548   and 1550   due to an intervening redshift system at z = 0.549 .",
    "the separation between the pair of absorption lines is 4.5  , while the redshifted separation of the c iv doublet is 4.00  , a 3.6 @xmath1 difference .",
    "also , the ratio of the two lines , @xmath42 , is consistent with the ratio from the c iv doublet in the optically thin limit .",
    "unfortunately , we can not confirm this suggestion by observing other high - ionization lines , since the strong lines lie below the wavelength limit of our observation .",
    "the only other line pair with the same fraction separation as the observed absorption ines are the oi @xmath43 and the siii @xmath44 lines , which would have a redshift of 0.841 .",
    "however , we rule out this identification due to the absence of other strong low - ionization absorption lines at the same redshift .    _",
    "qso 1127@xmath25269 _ : we discovered strong feii and mgii absorption at @xmath45 from a system between this qso and the foreground cluster .",
    "these features are noted by tick marks in figure 1 .",
    "imaging at v and i bands by us with the mdm 1.3 m telescope yielded no evidence of faint structure superimposed on or near the qso .    _ qso 1258@xmath25285 _ : this spectrum appears to contain several ly forest lines blueward of the qso ly@xmath22  and ly@xmath46  emission lines .",
    "it is difficult to identify absorption from the intervening cluster gas against this forest . in particular",
    ", the region where we would expect to find mgii absorption lies directly on the ly@xmath22  emission from the qso , making it impossible to separate true absorption from structure in the emission line .",
    "there appears to be absorption in some of the regions where we expect to find some of the feii absorption lines within the cluster .",
    "however , one of the strongest fe lines , feii @xmath30  is undetected , so we conclude that fe ii absorption at the cluster redshift is unlikely .",
    "absorption at the location of several other fe ii lines are probably ly forest lines .    since the qso ly@xmath46  line",
    "is shifted into our wavelength region , we can attempt to match corresponding ly@xmath46  and ly@xmath22  forest lines .",
    "for example , the doublet seen at 2280   is repeated 2700  , making this a likely ly@xmath46/ly@xmath22  pair .",
    "other such pairs are observed at 2320 /2750 and 2415 /2860  , the latter of these being strong absorption near or within the qso .",
    "the features seen between 24502620   could be ly@xmath22  forest lines , however their ly@xmath46 counterparts would lie below our short - wavelength cutoff . for redshift determination of these and other ambiguous features in table 2 , we assume they are ly@xmath22  lines",
    ".      we can place an upper limit on the equivalent width of any expected absorption lines simply by using the noise calculations performed by the line - searching software .",
    "the upper limits correspond to a maximum velocity dispersion of @xmath47 and are such that these lines , if present , would fall on the linear portion of the curve of growth .",
    "the column density for a weak ( optically thin ) line can be determined in the usual fashion using the relation ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1978 )    @xmath48    after correcting the equivalent width limits for redshift , we found upper limits to the column density of each species with lines falling in our spectral range .",
    "we employed a weighted average over all lines of a given species to further constrain the column density , weighting by the expected line strength and then adding individual line contributions in quadrature .",
    "the resulting 1-sigma upper limits to the column densities for each cluster are listed in table 3 , along with the wavelength and @xmath49-value of the strongest expected transition of each species .",
    "we have placed strict constraints on the amount of low - ionization absorbing material present in rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "if we assume a large covering fraction , then the column densities of the species in table 2 are @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 , and there is little low - ionization cool gas in the icm .",
    "our results are consistent with those of koekemoer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who found similar limits to @xmath50 for a variety of species along a single line of sight in abell 1030 .",
    "the results permit us to place constraints on the covering fraction of cool absorbing gas . with six independent lines of sight producing non - detections for",
    "the strongest expected line ( mgii @xmath51 ) , the covering fraction of low - ionization gas with @xmath52 @xmath4 must be less than 40% , at the 95% confidence level .",
    "although low ionization gas does not appear to have a large covering factor in galaxy clusters , little is known about higher ionization state gas , as is often identified through civ and siiv absorption .",
    "there are expectations that searches with the higher ionization will be more successful , based upon a few observations through other clusters . in an observation toward 3c  273 , which lies behind the outer part of the virgo cluster , ly@xmath22 absorption was detected at the redshift of the virgo cluster ( bahcall et al .",
    "it has a hi column density of at least 4@xmath5310@xmath54 @xmath4 and has detectable high ionization metal absorption lines ( hurwitz et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . in the future",
    ", we hope to study whether clusters are sites of high ionization absorption lines , and whether they produce ly@xmath22 absorption , thus completing the study of the absorbing properties of galaxy clusters .",
