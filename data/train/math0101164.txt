    "this inequality and other connected to it results were originally obtained in @xcite .",
    "a closely related problem is to estimate the norm of a single factor via the norm of the whole polynomial .",
    "clearly , we have to normalize the problem by assuming that @xmath33 is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath34 , with a monic factor @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 in the case of the unit disk , boyd @xcite proved an asymptotically sharp inequality @xmath37 with @xmath38 this inequality improved upon a series of results by mignotte @xcite , granville @xcite and glesser @xcite .",

    "a survey of the results involving other norms ( e.g. , bombieri norms ) can be found in @xcite .",

    "one can deduce inequalities of the type ( [ 3.0 ] ) , for various @xmath97 norms , from theorem [ thm1 ] , by using relations between @xmath97 and @xmath98 norms of polynomials on @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ) can be estimated from ( [ 2.1 ] ) as follows : @xmath100 which may be better than ( [ 3.0 ] ) in some cases .",
    "the following lemma is a generalization of lemma 2 in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for its proof .",
    "[ le5.1 ] let @xmath52 be a compact set ( not a single point ) and let @xmath101 then @xmath102 is a subharmonic function in @xmath2 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a positive unit borel measure in @xmath2 with unbounded support , i.e. , @xmath105    [ le5.2 ] ( bernstein - walsh ) let @xmath52 be a compact set , @xmath106 , with the unbounded component of @xmath107 denoted by @xmath108 .",
    "then , for any polynomial @xmath33 of degree @xmath34 , we have @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the green function of @xmath108 , with pole at @xmath111 , satisfying @xmath112    this is a well known result about the upper bound ( [ 5.7 ] ) for the growth of @xmath33 off the set @xmath1 ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the representation ( [ 5.8 ] ) for @xmath110 is also classical ( cf .",
    "theorem iii.37 in @xcite ) .    consider the @xmath34-th fekete points @xmath113 for a compact set @xmath52 ( cf .",
