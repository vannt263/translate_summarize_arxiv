    "in the local universe , the best laboratories for studying violent merging events ( considered key - mechanisms in driving galaxy evolution ) are the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "several studies indicate that ulirgs transform gas - rich disks into moderate mass ellipticals through merger - induced dissipative collapse @xcite .",
    "photometric analysis of ultraluminous merger remnants by @xcite and @xcite indicates that most of the sources are are well - fit by an elliptical - like r@xmath5 light profile .",
    "specrtoscopic analysis by @xcite and @xcite indicates that their stellar kinematics resemble those of dispersion - supported systems .",
    "while the end products of galactic mergers can be considered understood , several details of the merging process ( often related to the physics of the gas ) are still very uncertain , even in the local universe . a plethora of numerical models @xcite and observations @xcite indicates that major starburst episodes occur after the first galactic encounter and can be present after nuclear coalescence , before complete relaxation sets in . according to @xcite",
    ", the main accretion event happens after the coalescence .",
    "however , the relative contributions of starburst and agn to the infrared ( ir ) emission during each phase of a gas - rich merger are still unclear .",
    "whether ulirgs may go through a qso phase after the nuclear coalescence also needs to be confirmed .",
    "one way to investigate the physical details of mergers is to determine the evolution of the ulirg kinematic properties as a function of time .",
    "hence , we obtained high - resolution , h- and k- band isaac spectroscopic data for 54 ulirgs ( spanning a wide range of merger phase ) during our european southern observatory very large telescope ( vlt ) large program ( i d 171.b-0442 ) .",
    "of these sources ( at @xmath6 ) , 23 are binary ( not fully merged ) ulirgs and 30 are ( relaxed ) remnants .",
    "we extract the stellar dispersion @xmath7 and rotational @xmath8 velocity from the co rovibrational bandheads that appear in our spectra using the fourier correlation quotient technique @xcite ; this method provides the line - of - sight ( los ) broadening function with which a stellar template has to be convolved to produce the observed spectrum .",
    "we derive the kinematics of each individual component of the binary systems , to investigate the conditions under which ultraluminous infrared activity is triggered . from the stellar dispersion and rotational velocity ,",
    "we compute the masses of the merging galaxies .",
    "we find that that ultraluminous luminosities are are mainly generated by almost equal - mass mergers ; the average mass ratio of the binary ulirgs is 1.5:1 and 68% of these sources are 1:1 encounters @xcite .",
    "statistically , our result is in agreement with luminosity ratios inferred from imaging studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in individual cases",
    "though , luminosity does not always accurately trace mass due to stellar population and extinction effects .    to investigate whether dynamical heating ( mainly of the smaller companion ) can skew our results , we re - ran the simulations of @xcite with an @xmath9-body - plus - sph code after replacing 10% of the stellar mass with isothermal ( 10@xmath10 k ) gas . following the stellar dispersion as a function of time",
    ", we found that 3:1 mergers may appear to be 2:1 at nuclear separations as small as those we observe ( 7.2 kpc on average ) .",
    "since only a minority of our sources belong to these merger categories , our conclusions are stable against dynamical heating .",
    "mergers of mass ratio @xmath114:1 appear not to drive enough gas to the center of the merger to generate ultraluminous ir emission .      by studying the kinematics of ulirgs at merger phases that follow nuclear coalescence ( remnants ) and comparing them to the kinematics of the binary ulirgs , we find that the mean stellar dispersion increases during the coalescence phase by 15  ( namely from 142 to 157 ) .",
    "although this increase is significant ( within the 0.05 significance level of our monte carlo simulations ) , it constitutes only a lower limit on the dynamical heating that the merging galaxies undergo .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the ultraluminous phases are short compared to the total merger timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio between rotational and dispersion velocity of the ulirg remnants , which equals 0.31 and increases to 0.62 when inclination effects are taken into account , indicates that the remmants are dispersion - supported systems , resembling ellipticals ( es ) . to investigate",
    "what type of ellipticals ultraluminous mergers will form , @xcite suggested that ulirgs need to be placed on the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpp ] we present the effective radius- host dispersion ( @xmath12 ) projection of the plane , constructed from our data for 54 ulirgs ( triangles ) .",
    "giant ( boxy - isophotal profile ) es are shown in boxes , moderate - mass ( disky - isophotal profile ) es in filled circles , and further cluster es in open circles ( see caption for original references ) .",
    "some luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath13 ) are presented in diamonds .",
    "the fact that ulirgs clearly populate the moderate - mass ( @xmath110@xmath14 m@xmath15 ) es part of the fp suggests that these two populations are linked , while giant es probably have a different formation history .    from the dispersion velocity of the stars in the bulge of our ulirg remnants",
    ", we compute their bh mass @xmath16 using the @xmath17 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to test whether the  relation can be applied at the late ultraluminous phases of a merger , we ran our simulations ( presented in sect .",
    "[ pre ] ) and followed the host dispersion and the gas inflowing to the center of the simulation as a function of time .",
    "we found that by the time the nuclei coalesce , these quantities already scale linearly as long as the amount of gas that accretes onto the black hole from its surroundings ( center of the simulation ) is roughly constant with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the application of the  relation to the remnants yields black hole masses of the order @xmath18 .    the eddington efficiency @xmath19 ( the ratio between the eddington and the dynamical ) of the ulirg remnants is calculated by assigning 50% of the ir luminosity to the agn .",
    "this statistical assumption follows @xcite , who found that some ulirgs are largely starburst- while others are agn- powered , and may cause a few individual sources to accrete at super - eddington rates . if we assign @xmath19=1 to these sources , the mean eddington efficiency is 0.5 .",
    "such high @xmath19 values may be an observational confirmation of the theoretical predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest that after nuclear coalescence , the gas infall to the center of the system is so high that the agn may accrete at near - eddington rates .",
    "an evolutionary scenario for the late phases of gas - rich mergers , originally based on that of @xcite , is as follows : after coalescence , the ir emission arising from the nuclear starburst and agn - surrounding dust is strong enough to reach qso - like luminosities .",
    "however , as the dust and gas start clearing out from the nuclear region due to agn winds and supernova feedback , the system goes through a short ( up to  10@xmath3 yrs ) optically bright phase , before further accretion and star formation are finally prevented @xcite .    to test this scenario we obtained spectroscopic ( vlt isaac - pi tacconi , spitzer irs - pi veilleux ) and imaging ( hst nicmos - pi veilleux ) data for a ( small ) sample of palomar - green qsos @xcite as part of our quest ( qso / ulirg evolutionary study ) project .",
    "the vlt sample consists of 12 sources , most of which are ir - bright ( ratio of integrated ir to big blue bump luminosity @xmath20 ; surace et al . , 2001 ) . if the above evolutionary scenario is realistic , the ir - bright sources are transitional objects between ulirgs and ( optically - selected ) qsos .",
    "the hst nicmos imaging analysis of 7 ir - bright qsos by @xcite indicates that their hosts have similar h - band host magnitudes to those of ulirgs . in a similar vein",
    ", @xcite found that the ( optical ) spectra of most of their ir - bright qsos ( selected from the iras color - color diagrams ) are well fitted by an old population and a recent ( @xmath21 yrs ) strong starburst component .    from our high - resolution , large - collecting area data ( obtained under excellent seeing conditions @xmath22 )",
    ", we succeeded in extracting host dispersions of local qsos from nir co bandheads .",
    "the average dispersion of the ir - bright qsos is ( so far ) similar to that of ulirg remnants ( @xmath1 160 ) .",
    "thus , their black hole and host masses are also of comparable size ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 and 10@xmath23 - 10@xmath14  respectively ) .",
    "since ir - bright qsos have similar luminosities ( @xmath24 ) to ulirgs , their accretion rates are also high ( @xmath25 eddington ) .",
    "for the few optically selected sources observed so far , the scatter in the dynamical properties is higher .",
    "in one of the 12 qsos targeted by our large program , pg1426 + 015 , two nuclei separated by @xmath14kpc appear in the acquisition image ( also seen in hst nicmos data ; schade et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "our nir spectroscopy indicates that the nuclei are at the same redshift .",
    "the optical spectrum of the bright component has very broad emission lines @xcite , verifying that the emission originating from this component can be attributed to an agn .",
    "calculation of the ir luminosity of the system ( from iras fluxes ) indicates that it is a lirg .",
    "the spectra of the qso and the secondary nucleus are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pg1426 ] .",
    "the second nucleus does not show any indications of strong agn continuum and resembles those of the binary ulirgs ; therefore we believe that it is starburst dominated .",
    "this system constitutes a good example of how mergers can simultaneously trigger strong accretion and starburst events .",
    "these findings contradict the aforementioned scenario in that the qso phase is reached already before nuclear coalescence .",
    "the ir - bright qsos seem to differ from local qsos that host even more massive black holes , such as the @xmath26 radio - loud ( rl ) sources or their radio - quiet optical counterparts ( rqc ) of @xcite .",
    "the rl / rqc qsos have black hole masses of order 10@xmath3 and 10@xmath27  that accrete on average at rates @xmath1 0.05 eddington , and that are located in @xmath28 times more massive and ( k - band ) luminous hosts .",
    "the positions of ir - bright and rl / rqc qsos on the fundamental plane can be clearly distinguished ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fpp ] ) ; like giant es vis - a - vis ulirgs , the rl / rqc qsos probably have a different formation history from the ir - bright population .",
    "our preliminary results seem to indicate evolutionary links between ulirgs and ir - bright qsos ; however , the fact that some ir qsos have prominent spiral hosts ( surace et al .",
    ", 2001 ; veilleux et al . , 2006 ) implies that they may have a minor - merger origin ( different from that of ulirgs in terms of the mass ratio of the merging galaxies ) .",
    "furthermore , ir - bright qsos are only a small and not necessarily representative part of the pg poopulation .",
    "we need to enrich our sample with optically selected qsos in order to derive conclusions about the optically bright phase of this scenario .",
    "from the high - resolution nir spectrocopic data we have obtained for local ulirgs and qsos , we have found that    * for ir luminosity @xmath0  to be triggered during a gas - rich merger , encounters of comparable mass galaxies are ( typically ) required . * evolution ( increase ) of the host dispersion is observed as the merger advances from pre- to post- coalescence . * the merger remnants resemble moderate - mass ( @xmath110@xmath23 - 10@xmath14 ) ellipticals .",
    "the black holes they host are of the order 10@xmath29 - 10@xmath30  and , on average , accrete at high eddington rates ( @xmath310.5 ) . *",
    "the ir bright qso dispersions and black hole masses , being of the order 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 , resemble those of ulirg remnants and indicate a possible link between the two populations .",
    "our ir - bright sources differ from qsos that host supermassive black holes and accrete at low rates . *",
    "imaging and spectroscopy of pg 1426 + 015 show that it is a binary system of nuclear separation @xmath14 kpc .",
    "already at this early merger phase , one of the components is a powerful qso ( with strong dust continuum ) ."
