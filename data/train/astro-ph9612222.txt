    "the temperature in these intermediate layers of the protoneutron star is higher than near the center because of the heating caused by the forming supernova shock .",
    "moreover , as the deleptonization of the protoneutron star progresses , electron degeneracy energy which is released in the process @xmath206 , is not completely radiated away from the surface of the star by the emission of all kinds of neutrinos .",
    "instead , due to downscattering and multiple absorption and reemission of diffusing neutrinos , a part of this energy stays in the star and leads to heating of the gas .",

    "[ f2 ] ) and the temperature peak advances inward to the center of the star , following the motion of the layer where most of the lepton ( electron ) loss occurs . at the time when the temperature maximum has reached the center of the star ( after @xmath207 ) , the chemical potential @xmath208 of electron neutrinos has dropped to its final equilibrium value @xmath209 that corresponds to deleptonized , neutronized conditions .",
