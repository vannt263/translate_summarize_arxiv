    "precision experiments in the last two decades have elevated the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics from a promising description to a provisional law of nature , tested as a quantum field theory at the level of one percent or better . despite its triumphs the sm is not an entirely satisfactory theory , however , because it has various theoretical shortcomings . in particular , the gauge hierarchy problem , _",
    "i.e. _ , the instability of the electroweak scale @xmath7 under radiative corrections , has spurred the imagination of many theorists and led to the development of a plethora of models of physics beyond the sm that envision new phenomena at or not far above the tev scale .",
    "a particularly appealing proposal for stabilizing the electroweak scale , featuring one compact extra dimension with a non - factorizable anti - de  sitter ( ads@xmath8 ) metric , is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite , which by virtue of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite can be thought of as dual to a strongly coupled four - dimensional ( 4d ) cft . with two three - branes acting as the boundaries of the warped extra dimension",
    ", the ads@xmath8 background generates an exponential hierarchy of energy scales , so that the natural scale at one orbifold fixed point ( the ultra - violet ( uv ) brane ) is much larger than at the other ( the infra - red ( ir ) brane ) , @xmath9 . in the rs framework",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is thus solved by gravitational red - shifting .",
    "there are numerous possibilities for building models of electroweak symmetry breaking in ads@xmath8 .",
    "the basic building blocks for the construction of a viable theory include , among others , the choice of the bulk gauge group , the zero - mode fermion localization , and the dynamical mechanism for localizing the higgs field on ( or near ) the ir brane . while in the original rs proposal all sm fields",
    "were constrained to reside on the ir boundary and the gauge group was taken to be @xmath10 , it was soon realized that allowing gauge @xcite and matter fields @xcite to spread in the ads@xmath8 bulk not only avoids dangerous higher - dimensional operators suppressed only by powers of @xmath11 , but also admits a natural explanation of the flavor structure of the sm @xcite via geometrical sequestering @xcite .",
    "this way of generating fermion hierarchies also implies a certain amount of suppression of dangerous flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) @xcite , a scheme referred to as the rs - gim mechanism @xcite .",
    "harmful contributions to the @xmath1 parameter can be cured in an elegant way by extending the bulk hypercharge group to @xmath12 and breaking it to @xmath13 on the uv brane @xcite .",
    "an appropriate embedding of the down - type sm quarks into the custodial rs model further furnishes the possibility to reduce the tree - level corrections to the @xmath14 vertex @xcite and its flavor - changing counterparts @xcite . as a result ,",
    "all existing electroweak precision and cp - conserving fcnc constraints are typically satisfied for the mass of the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) gauge boson below a few tev . however , in spite of the rs - gim mechanism , cp - violating effects in the neutral kaon system @xcite and corrections to the neutron electric dipole moment @xcite tend to be too large in models with flavor anarchy , pushing the new - physics scale to at least 10 tev and thus beyond the reach of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . relaxing the latter bounds seems to require an additional flavor alignment in warped models and has triggered a lot of model - building activity .",
    "the purpose of this article is to perform a thorough analysis of the structure of the rs variant with extended gauge symmetry @xmath15 in the bulk , where @xmath3 interchanges the two @xmath16 groups and is responsible for the protection of the @xmath14 vertex . while in the existing literature on the custodial rs model the couplings of the bulk fields to the higgs sector",
    "are treated as a perturbation , we instead construct the exact solutions to the bulk equations of motion ( eoms ) subject to appropriate boundary conditions ( bcs ) . in that way",
    "we obtain exact results for the profiles and masses of the various sm particles and their kk excitations .",
    "this approach is not only more elegant but also offers several advantages over the perturbative approach .",
    "in particular , it facilitates the analytic calculation of all terms of order @xmath17 , including those arising from the breaking of the @xmath3 symmetry by the bcs and possibly the bulk masses .",
    "the physical interpretation of the obtained results in terms of ( ir)reducible sources of symmetry breaking is thus evident in our approach , while it remains somewhat hidden if the couplings of the bulk fields to the higgs sector are treated as a perturbation from the very beginning .",
    "the exact approach also permits to include the mixing of fermions between different generations in a completely general way , making the dependence on the exact realization of the matter sector explicit . in turn , it is straightforward to address questions about the model - dependence of the resulting gauge- and higgs - boson interactions with the sm fermions . in summary ,",
    "our work puts the theory of custodial warped extra dimensions on a more sound basis , both at the field theoretical and phenomenological level . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will apply the derived results to tree - level flavor - violating @xmath18 and @xmath19 processes in the quark sector .",
    "this article is organized as follows . after recalling important definitions and notations ,",
    "we discuss in section  [ sec : gauge ] the kk decomposition of the bulk gauge fields in the presence of the brane - localized higgs sector , working in a covariant @xmath20 gauge .",
    "we also show how to compute sums over kk towers of gauge bosons in closed form .",
    "the analogous discussion for bulk fermions is presented in section  [ sec : fermions ] .",
    "special attention is devoted to the correct implementation of yukawa couplings containing @xmath21-odd fermion profiles . in sections  [ sec :",
    "custodialprotection ] and [ sec : higgscouplings ] we present the main results of our work .",
    "we first analyze the structure of gauge - boson interactions with sm fermions and then study the couplings of the higgs boson to matter . in the first case ,",
    "we give analytic formulas that expose , on one hand , the prerequisites for achieving a custodial protection of the left - handed @xmath2-boson couplings and , on the other , which are the terms that necessarily escape protection .",
    "in addition , we show explicitly that no protection mechanism is present in the charged - current sector . in the second case ,",
    "the exact dependence on the realization of the fermion sector of the higgs - fermion couplings is worked out . in our article",
    "we concentrate on the leading contributions to the observables of interest , ignoring possible effects of brane - localized kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "although the uv dynamics is not specified , it is natural to assume that these terms are loop suppressed , so that they can be neglected to first order .",
    "the most important phenomenological implications of our findings are discussed in section  [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "we begin by studying the constraints imposed by the precision measurements of the bottom - quark pseudo observables , including all tree - level corrections that avoid protection .",
    "we further discuss the phenomenology of rare top decays in the extended rs model and compare it to the one of the minimal formulation .",
    "finally , we explore the possible changes of the higgs production cross section and branching fractions at the lhc , including all leading - order quantum corrections stemming from the extended electroweak gauge - boson and fermion sectors . in a series of appendices",
    "we collect details on the derivation of the ir bcs and higgs - boson fcncs in the presence of both @xmath21-even and -odd yukawa couplings , our input values for the sm parameters , and the explicit expressions for the form factors needed to calculate the production cross section and the branching ratios of the higgs boson in the rs model .",
    "we work with the non - factorizable rs geometry @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote the coordinates on the 4d hyper - surfaces of constant @xmath24 with metric @xmath25 .",
    "the fifth dimension is an @xmath26 orbifold of size @xmath27 labeled by @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the extra dimension has orbifold fixed points at @xmath29 ( the uv brane ) and @xmath30 ( the ir brane ) .",
    "since the ratio of the warp factor and the curvature , @xmath31 , corresponds to an inverse energy scale in the 4d theory , the gauge hierarchy problem can be tamed by an appropriate choice of the product @xmath32 . in order to address the hierarchy between the electroweak scale , @xmath33 , and the fundamental planck scale , @xmath34 , one has to choose @xmath35 below",
    "we will sometimes refer to @xmath36 as the `` volume '' of the extra dimension .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 also sets the mass scale for the low - lying kk excitations of the sm fields to be of order of the `` kk scale '' @xmath38 for instance , the masses of the first kk photon and gluon are approximately @xmath39",
    ".    it will often be convenient to introduce a coordinate @xmath40 , which equals @xmath41 on the uv brane and 1 on the ir brane @xcite .",
    "integrals over the orbifold are then obtained using the following replacements @xmath42    we now have enough definitions and notations in place to start our discussion .",
    "in this section we construct the kk decomposition in the gauge sector and derive exact solutions for the bulk fields , including the effects of an ir brane - localized higgs sector . in all previous works on the rs model with custodial protection , the couplings of the higgs sector to bulk fields were treated as a perturbation , expanding the theory in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to the necessity of diagonalizing infinite - dimensional matrices which have to be truncated , including only one ( or a few ) kk excitations .",
    "while such an approach should in general lead to sensible results @xcite , it is worthwhile to study the set - up within the basis of mass eigenstates , thereby obtaining exact results @xcite .",
    "indeed , we will see that the summation over the entire kk tower receives additional contributions , which are lost through truncation @xcite . as the sum",
    "can be evaluated in closed form , it is convenient to work with the complete sum and afterwards expand the obtained expressions in powers of @xmath43 . proceeding in this way one can clearly distinguish between leading and subleading terms .",
    "alternatively one could use five - dimensional ( 5d ) propagators @xcite , which would be equivalent to our method .",
    "an exhaustive treatment of the perturbative approach featuring truncation after the first mode can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider the rs model with custodial protection as proposed in @xcite , with the bulk gauge symmetry @xmath44 . on the ir brane , the symmetry - breaking pattern @xmath45 provides a custodial symmetry , which protects the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "the additional @xmath3 symmetry prevents the left - handed @xmath46 coupling from receiving excessively large corrections @xcite . on the uv brane",
    ", the symmetry breaking @xmath47 generates the sm gauge group . the symmetry breaking down to @xmath48",
    "is related to the interplay of uv and ir bcs and will become clear later on .",

    "the higgs lagrangian @xmath52 is localized on the ir brane .",
    "a simple prescription of how to deal with @xmath53 has already been presented in @xcite and we postpone a refined treatment to section [ sec : fermkk ] .",
    "the gauge - fixing lagrangian , @xmath54 , will be given in the next section .",
    "we choose the four - vector components of the gauge fields to be even under the @xmath21 parity , while the scalar fifth components are odd , in order to arrive at a low - energy spectrum that is consistent with observation .",

    "the rotations are analogous to the usual definitions of the @xmath2 boson and photon fields in the sm , which are themselves postponed to ( [ eq : za ] ) .",

    "it follows that in the decoupling limit , @xmath357 , one has @xmath358 from the numbers of the fit coefficients given in table  [ tab : kappas ] , we see that this relation is satisfied to an accuracy of around @xmath359 .",
    "the kk - fermion effects in the down- and @xmath334-type quark sectors that contribute to @xmath360 , and @xmath361 are thus universal , in the sense that they can be simply obtained from each other by an appropriate replacement of the vector couplings of the external fields .",
    "making now the plausible assumption that in the decoupling limit the sums @xmath336 and @xmath362 differ only by the presence of the vector couplings @xmath363 and @xmath364 , we obtain the following estimate for the contribution to ( [ kkleptonsinkappaaz ] ) from leptonic relative to down - type quark kk modes : @xmath365 as a result , the sum ( [ kkleptonsinkappaaz ] ) can be approximated as @xmath366 where the last term on the right - hand side encodes the effects due to kk leptons , and in order to obtain the numerical values we have inserted the relevant electroweak quantum numbers and used @xmath367 . for @xmath368 , the real part of the relation ( [ eq : sumlkk ] ) evaluates to @xmath369 ( @xmath370 ) if effects due to kk leptons are excluded ( included ) .",
    "while these numbers imply that an omission of kk lepton effects can change the numerical value of the kk fermion contribution notably , it is not difficult to see that the impact on ( [ kappagammaz ] ) itself is limited , since the coefficient @xmath371 is dominated by the @xmath153-boson triangle contribution .",
    "we thus conclude that the absence of kk - lepton contributions in our prediction for @xmath242 ( which is anyhow difficult to study at the lhc ) will not change any of the conclusions drawn below .",
    "the coefficient @xmath372 in ( [ kappagammaz ] ) incorporates the effects in @xmath242 due to charged kk - boson excitations in the loop .",

    "notice that the prefactor in the second line of the above formula corresponds to the choice @xmath376 .",
    "since the first term in the sum of ( [ eq : nugammaz ] ) is already suppressed by a factor of @xmath43 , the computation of @xmath372 to this order only requires the knowledge of the overlap integral ( [ eq : iwwz ] ) to zeroth order in the ratio of the weak over the kk scale .",
    "we obtain @xmath377 it is again an excellent approximation to evaluate the loop function @xmath378 in the infinite mass limit @xmath379 , in which the form factor approaches @xmath380 .",
    "we perform the sum in ( [ eq : nugammaz ] ) numerically , including sufficiently many kk levels until the series converges . in this way",
    ", we find @xmath381 @xmath382 for @xmath383 ( @xmath384 ) .",
    "values for @xmath372 corresponding to different kk scales can be obtained by means of the fit formula @xmath385 with the coefficient @xmath386 given in table  [ tab : kappas ] .    in the two panels of figure  [ fig : kappas ] we display the relative corrections @xmath387 , @xmath388 , and @xmath389 for @xmath217 ( left ) and @xmath390 ( right ) .",
    "the depicted curves represent the rs results obtained from ( [ eq : hbosoncoupl ] ) and ( [ eq : nugammaw ] ) as well as the relevant fit formulas with the values of the coefficients collected in table [ tab : kappas ] . while the behavior of @xmath387 has already been explained in section  [ sec : higgsproduction ] , we see that @xmath391 is close to 1 and independent of the value of the higgs - boson mass .",
    "this implies that the partial decay width @xmath392 in the custodial rs model is essentially unchanged with respect to the sm .",
    "the relative correction @xmath388 is , on the other hand , a non - trivial function of @xmath393 . below the @xmath280 threshold ,",
    "the @xmath153-boson amplitude dominates the sm @xmath289 decay rate and the contributions due to kk quarks and @xmath153 bosons both interfere constructively with the sm gauge - boson triangle graph . for @xmath394 , the new - physics contributions amount to around @xmath395 ( @xmath396 ) of the total sm amplitude for @xmath368 ( @xmath397 ) , resulting in values @xmath398 ( @xmath399 ) . for @xmath400 ,",
    "the higgs - mass dependence of the sm amplitude becomes less pronounced and the rs prediction stays almost constant .",
    "the strong rise of @xmath388 , visible at higher values of the higgs mass , results from the fact that for @xmath401 the top - quark loop nearly cancels the @xmath153-boson contribution in the sm . in consequence , for @xmath402 the partial width @xmath403 is almost entirely due to loops involving heavy kk modes , with the contribution from kk quarks being the dominant correction .",
    "the various higgs - boson branching ratios obtained using the above results are shown in figure  [ fig : hxx ] .",
    "the dashed lines illustrate the sm expectations calculated with the help of hdecay @xcite , , the original input file of hdecay version 3.51 is used . ] while the solid lines represent the rs predictions based on the results for @xmath404 quoted above and the curves for @xmath405 displayed in figure  [ fig : kappas ] .",
    "it is evident that in the custodial rs model the branching ratios @xmath406 , @xmath407 , and @xmath408 receive only insignificant corrections , not exceeding the level of @xmath409 .",
    "for @xmath410 the experimentally cleanest signature for the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc is its `` golden '' decay to four leptons , @xmath411 .",
    "since the @xmath408 branching fraction is essential sm - like , the reduction in the @xmath228 production cross section will make an observation of the higgs boson in the golden channel more difficult .",
    "moderate effects occur in the non - discovery channels @xmath299 and @xmath412 . in the relevant ranges for the higgs mass , the modifications in the branching ratios amount to around @xmath413 ( @xmath414 ) and @xmath415 ( @xmath255 ) for @xmath217 ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "the most pronounced effects are found for @xmath416 and @xmath289 .",
    "for higgs masses below the @xmath280 threshold , the branching fraction of the former mode is reduced by a factor of almost 4 ( 8) , while the branching ratio of the latter transition is enhanced by a factor of around 4 ( 2 ) .",
    "the corresponding maximal values of @xmath417 are @xmath418 ( @xmath419 ) for @xmath217 ( @xmath254 ) and arise at @xmath420 . calculating the rescaling factor @xmath421 for @xmath422 and the quoted maximal branching fractions , we obtain the values @xmath423 ( @xmath424 ) .",
    "these numbers suggest that the statistical significance for a lhc discovery of the higgs boson in @xmath289 can be enhanced in the custodial rs model for low kk scales . a detailed study of how the deviations found in the rs framework affect the searches for the higgs boson at the lhc will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we add that if the kk scale is lowered to @xmath425 , the branching ratio of @xmath426 can reach values above @xmath240 for higgs masses above @xmath427 .",
    ", the corresponding decay rate is simply obtained from ( [ brthc ] ) by multiplying the branching fraction for @xmath428 with @xmath429 and replacing @xmath430 through @xmath431 .",
    "of course , an analogous formula applies in the case of @xmath432 .",
    "] for such a low kk scale , also the decay channel @xmath433 can open up below the @xmath280 threshold , but typically stays below the level of @xmath434 . note that our results for the higgs - boson branching fractions depend primarily on the value of the kk scale , and are rather insensitive to the other free parameters present in the model .",
    "for example , the final results do not strongly depend on the precise localization pattern of the fermionic bulk fields",
    ". we also verified that the omission of kk - lepton effects does not have a pronounced effect .",
    "rs predictions for the various branching fractions of the higgs boson have been presented previously in @xcite .",
    "yet a direct comparison with our results is difficult , as the latter work only includes rs corrections affecting the tree - level couplings of the higgs boson to fermions .",
    "we have performed a thorough analysis of the structure of tree - level effects in the rs model with enlarged bulk gauge symmetry @xmath0 and an ir brane - localized higgs sector .",
    "in contrast to the existing literature , where the yukawa couplings have always been treated as a perturbation , we have performed the kk decomposition of the gauge fields in a covariant @xmath20 gauge within the basis of mass eigenstates , by constructing the exact solutions to the bulk equations of motion augmented with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the kk decomposition in the matter sector has been performed employing the same formalism and including the mixing of fermionic fields between different representations and generations in a completely general way . by expanding the exact results , we have derived simple analytic expressions for the profiles and masses of the various sm particles as well as for the sums over kk towers of gauge bosons , which include all terms up to second order in the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath435 over the kk mass scale @xmath316 .",
    "we have demonstrated that our exact approach is not only more elegant , but also offers some distinct advantages over treating the couplings of the bulk fields to the higgs sector perturbatively . by expanding the low - energy spectrum as well as the gauge couplings in powers of @xmath43",
    ", we have obtained analytic formulas which allow not only for a numerical treatment , but for a transparent and explicit understanding of the model - specific protection mechanisms of the peskin - takeuchi parameter @xmath1 and the left - handed @xmath2-boson vertices involving down - type quarks . in the case of the gauge - boson corrections to the @xmath436 couplings ,",
    "we have pointed out all terms that escape the custodial protection and identified them with the irreducible sources of @xmath3-symmetry breaking , originating from the different boundary conditions of untwisted and twisted gauge - boson profiles on the uv brane . unlike in the perturbative approach , which in general requires diagonalizing high - dimensional matrices numerically",
    ", the interpretation of our results in physical terms is thus very clear . by making the dependence on the implementation of the matter sector explicit",
    ", we were also able to address the important question about the model - dependence of the resulting gauge - boson interactions with sm fermions .",
    "we have shown in this context , that the @xmath3 symmetry is explicitly broken by the bulk mass parameters of the @xmath21-odd @xmath62 singlet fields if their values differ from the ones of their @xmath21-even counterparts . turning our attention to the charged - current interactions",
    ", we have then demonstrated that a custodial protection in not at work in this case .",
    "we have finally revisited the issue of the flavor - misalignment between fermion zero - mode masses and yukawa couplings , extending existing analyses of the structure of the flavor - changing higgs - boson couplings to the case of the rs scenario with custodial protection .",
    "subsequently we have considered some simple applications of our general results .",
    "a thorough discussion of the constraints imposed by the precision measurements of the bottom - quark pseudo observables opened our phenomenological survey .",
    "we found that , contrary to the minimal case , the prediction for the correction to the @xmath205 vertex in the rs model with extended @xmath3 symmetry is essentially independent of the left - handed bulk mass parameter of the third - generation quarks .",
    "this feature relaxes the bounds that originate from the precision measurements of the left - handed @xmath2-boson coupling significantly , giving a strong motivation to protect the latter vertex through a suitable embedding of the bottom quarks .",
    "we have furthermore pointed out that , irrespectively of the bulk gauge group and barring an unnatural large value of the bulk mass parameter of the right - handed top quark , the requirement to obtain the correct top- and bottom - quark masses excludes large corrections to the @xmath437 coupling .",
    "a direct explanation of the anomaly in the forward - backward asymmetry for bottom quarks seems therefore generically challenging in warped extra - dimension models in which the left - handed bottom and top quark are part of the same multiplet .",
    "allowing for a heavy higgs boson with a mass in the ballpark of 0.5 tev ( which is the naturally expected mass range for @xmath393 in models with a brane - localized higgs sector ) leads however to a good agreement between @xmath438 data and theory . yet",
    ", a heavy higgs boson would need tuning in models with custodial symmetry , since the shifts induced by @xmath439 in the parameters @xmath165 and @xmath1 can not be compensated by rs tree - level effects , and thus would require the presence of sizable oblique loop corrections in order not to spoil the global electroweak fit .",
    "detailed numerical analyses of the new - physics effects in rare top - quark decays as well as of the changes in the production cross section and branching fractions of the higgs boson completed our phenomenological investigations . in the former case",
    ", we found that due to the protection of the @xmath14 vertex , the experimental prospects for observing @xmath440 and @xmath441 are more favorable in the extended than in the minimal rs scenario . in particular , for kk gauge - boson masses below @xmath442",
    "the branching fractions of both @xmath443 and @xmath428 can be within the reach of the lhc . in the latter case",
    ", our study revealed that due to the composite nature of the higgs boson , the top quark , and the kk modes , observable effects in higgs physics can naturally occur in the scenario under consideration . in order to arrive at this conclusion",
    ", we have performed the first complete one - loop calculation of all higgs - boson production and decay channels relevant at hadron colliders , incorparating all effects stemming from the extended electroweak gauge boson and fermion sectors . concerning the main higgs - boson production modes at the tevatron and the lhc , proceeding through @xmath228 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221",
    ", we found that they are all suppressed in the custodial rs model relative to the sm . since the shifts in the production cross sections can exceed the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainties , the reduction in higgs events predicted in the rs framework might be observable at the lhc . on the other hand",
    ", the reduced @xmath228 production cross section should make an observation of the higgs boson with a mass above the @xmath444 threshold via the `` golden '' four - lepton channel more difficult , because the @xmath408 branching fraction remains essential sm - like in the custodial rs model .",
    "the possible enhancement of the branching ratio for @xmath289 might however lead to a higher statistical significance and a faster lhc discovery of the higgs boson , if its mass is below the @xmath280 threshold .",
    "we emphasize that our findings concerning higgs physics have to be considered robust predictions , since they depend rather weakly on the details of the spectrum ( and thus the specific rs parameter values ) once the contributions of the entire kk towers have been included .",

    "<S> we reexamine the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model with enlarged gauge symmetry @xmath0 in the presence of a brane - localized higgs sector . in contrast to the existing literature , we perform the kaluza - klein ( kk ) decomposition within the mass basis , which avoids the truncation of the kk towers . expanding the low - energy spectrum as well as the gauge couplings in powers of the higgs vacuum expectation value , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain analytic formulas which allow for a deep understanding of the model - specific protection mechanisms of the @xmath1 parameter and the left - handed @xmath2-boson couplings . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the latter case we explain which contributions escape protection and identify them with the irreducible sources of @xmath3 symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore show explicitly that no protection mechanism is present in the charged - current sector confirming existing model - independent findings . </S>",
    "<S> the main focus of the phenomenological part of our work is a detailed discussion of higgs - boson couplings and their impact on physics at the cern large hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , a complete one - loop calculation of all relevant higgs - boson production and decay channels is presented , incorporating the effects stemming from the extended electroweak gauge - boson and fermion sectors .    </S>",
