    "electron transport in hybrid superconductive - normal systems at low temperatures is governed by the andreev reflection . both finite - voltage conductance @xmath2 between superconductive and normal electrodes , and josephson critical current @xmath3 between two superconductive banks , separated by normal region ,",
    "are determined by the cooper pair propagation in the normal metal .",
    "the theory of the andreev conductance ( without coulomb effects ) was developed in , e.  g. , @xcite , whereas the josephson coupling was calculated ( with the account of short - range electron interaction ) in  @xcite .",
    "when normal conducting region is made of a dirty metal film , or two - dimensional electron gas with low density of electrons , coulomb interaction in the normal region may lead to strong quantum fluctuations which suppress both the andreev conductance and the josephson proximity effect .",
    "several different kinds of quantum effects are known to be relevant in low - dimensional conductors at low temperatures .",
    "quantum corrections to the conductivity of two - dimensional dirty conductors grow logarithmically as temperature @xmath4 decreases and become large at @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the dimensionless conductance , @xmath7 is the conductance per square , and @xmath8 is the elastic scattering time ) .",
    "there are two main types of these effects : weak localization corrections  @xcite , and interaction - induced corrections  @xcite .",
    "other important quantum effects include interaction - induced suppression of the tunneling conductance (  zero - bias anomaly \"  @xcite ) , and disorder - induced suppression  @xcite of superconductive transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "these effects are of the relative order of @xmath10 , i.  e.  much stronger than the weak localization and interaction effects .",
    "earlier studies of all those effects  @xcite employed perturbative diagram technique based on the expansion over semiclassical parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this method has an obvious drawback : the number and complexity of diagrams grows fast with the order of perturbation theory , which makes its use very difficult in the lowest - temperature region where effects are strong .",
    "some combination of the perturbative diagram technique and functional methods was used in earlier paper  @xcite , where the first attempt to calculate the effect of long - range coulomb interaction upon @xmath9 was made .",
    "more advanced functional methods were then developed in the weak localization theory  @xcite , which made it possible to average the fermionic functional integral over disorder , and reduce it to an  effective \" form which contains slowly varying diffusive modes only .",
    "those approaches have used either the replica trick  @xcite or the method of supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "whereas the supersymmetry method was found to be very powerful and convenient for the study of single - electron effects , it can not be used in the cases where quantum corrections due to electron - electron interactions are important .",
    "the replica method was generalized for the interacting systems by finkelstein ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the review ) ; in particular , he has shown that in dirty films the superconductive @xmath9 vanishes at @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 is the bare ( bcs ) transition temperature ) .",
    "the drawback of the replica method is that it contains an unphysical procedure of analytic continuation over the number of replicas @xmath14 , and , also , it is difficult to use it for the study of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "long time ago keldysh  @xcite proposed an approach which allows to treat kinetic phenomena in metals with the use , both , of the green function technique , and of the kinetic equation for the distribution function .",
    "this approach was found to be especially fruitful in the theory of superconductivity , where dynamic equations for the green functions were derived in the dirty limit  @xcite ( cf .  also review articles @xcite ) . in the static limit ,",
    "these equations coincide with the usadel equations  @xcite .",
    "keldysh approach often was found to be the most simple and transparent , even for the treatment of linear - response problems , since it does not involve tedious analytic continuation procedures .",
    "it is also the only known method for the treatment of nonlinear and/or non - equilibrium problems . in some cases nonlinearities with respect to both external and _ fluctuating _ fields",
    "are important , so one needs either to sum up very large number of diagrams , or to develop some effective action formalism within the keldysh approach .",
    "such an approach was recently developed , for normal metals , by kamenev and andreev  @xcite . in many respects",
    "we will follow this seminal paper in our analysis .",
    "a similar approach was also recently developed in  @xcite , where finkelstein s renormalization group equations for dirty metals were rederived for the case of short - range electron - electron interaction .",
    "for the earlier approaches to develop functional integral methods in the keldysh representation see  @xcite .    in the present paper we will develop the keldysh functional approach for dirty superconductors , and will use it for the study of the coulomb - interaction effects in the low - temperature andreev conductance @xmath2 between superconductor and normal metal and in the josephson proximity coupling @xmath15 via dirty 2d metal .",
    "it will be shown that both of the above - mentioned effects , interaction - induced suppression of the tunneling dos , and renormalization of the cooper - channel interaction , contribute considerably into the suppression of @xmath2 and @xmath15 in the low - energy limit .",
    "these two effects differ in the following sense : specific form of the dos suppression depends crucially on the long - range behaviour of the coulomb potential ( and thus can be varied externally by changing electromagnetic environment ) , whereas renormalization of the cooper - channel interaction depends on the short - distance coulomb amplitude only .",
    "if long - range coulomb forces are suppressed ( i.  e.  by placing a nearby screening electrode ) , the dos suppression effect may become weak . in this case",
    "the main effect comes from the presence of short - range repulsion in the cooper channel ; as a result , both the andreev conductance @xmath16 and the josephson proximity coupling @xmath17 exhibit anomalous power - law suppression in the infra - red limit , with exponents of the order of @xmath18 . in the case of no static coulomb screening ,",
    "the dos suppression effect is the strongest one in the asymptotic infra - red limit , it leads to the  log - normal \" suppression of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath19 .",
    "the influence of long - range coulomb interaction on the andreev conductance was treated previously  @xcite in a kind of phenomenological circuit theory . in the asymptotic limit @xmath20 our results are in agreement with those of  @xcite and provide a microscopic derivation for the effective impedance function used there phenomenologically ; in the intermediate region @xmath21 an additional contribution due to the cooper - channel repulsion ( not treated in  @xcite )",
    "is shown to be equally important .",

    "section  [ s : andreev ] is devoted to the calculation of the andreev conductance as a function of frequency and/or temperature in the presence of the coulomb effects ; we consider two different geometries of n - s contact both in the presence and absence of the dos suppression effect . in section  [",

    "our superconductive coupling constant @xmath31 coincides with the finkelstein s definition  @xcite of @xmath32 . generally speaking",
    ", one should also introduce singlet and triplet coupling constants , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in finkelstein s notations , in the diffusion channel . in 2-dimensional systems , the correction to them has the relative order of the weak localization effect , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the relevant energy scale .",
    "therefore , for the study of the coulomb effects in the cooper channel and in the tunneling density of states , they may be considered constant and can be incorporated into the fermi - liquid renormalization of the parameters of the lagrangian ( [ l - e ] ) . throughout the paper @xmath37 .",
    "we are going to construct an effective theory of soft modes in the problem .",
    "for this purpose one has to be able to take all possible channels into account that is accomplished@xcite by introducing a bispinor [ bispinor ] = 12 (    c _ + _ + ^ * _ + -^ * _    ) .",
    "@xmath38 is a vector in the 4-dimensional space @xmath36 which can be considered as the direct product @xmath39 of the spin ( @xmath40 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath41 ) spaces .",
    "the correlations between different time - reversal components of @xmath38 are responsible for the quantum correction to the conductivity in the orthogonal case@xcite when the hamiltonian possesses time - reversal symmetry . on the other hand , in studying superconducting phenomena , it is convenient to rearrange components of the bispinor in a different manner , separating explicitly the gorkov - nambu@xcite ( @xmath42 ) and spin spaces",
    ". finally , one can think of @xmath38 as acting in the direct product of the nambu ( @xmath43 ) and time - reversal spaces .",
    "these three representations are equivalent , @xmath44 ; we will not specify a certain one and will change between them depending on the problem at hand . for later reference",
    ", we define the pauli matrices in the spin , time - reversal , and nambu spaces as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 respectively ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the action of these matrices on the bispinor ( [ bispinor ] ) is equivalent to multiplication by @xmath49 matrices ; a few examples of them are listed below : s_x (    cccc 0&1&0&0 + 1&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&-1 + 0&0&-1&0    ) , _ x (    cccc 0&0&1&0 + 0&0&0&-1 + 1&0&0&0 + 0&-1&0&0    ) , t_y (    cccc 0&0&0&i + 0&0&-i&0 + 0&i&0&0 + -i&0&0&0    ) . below we will use the vector @xmath38 together with its conjugate vector @xmath50 .",

    "the system is supposed to be in the thermal equilibrium , with the interaction and disorder potential being turned off .",
    "the latter are switched on adiabatically during the time - evolution .",
    "the electromagnetic potentials @xmath60 and @xmath61 entering the action ( [ action ] ) consist of fluctuating and external ( source ) parts : @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the partition function describing the evolution along the contour can be written in terms of the functional integral over fermionic fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 and fluctuating electromagnetic field potentials @xmath66 , @xmath67 as [ z - def ] = d\\{^ * , } d\\{_fl,_fl } d\\ { } e^is , where the action is given by s = _ c l dt . [ action ] external fields ( introduced through the _ source terms _ in the action ) should not be integrated out in the functional integral ( [ z - def ] ) .",
    "if all external fields are _ classical _ , i.  e. identical for the forward and backward propagation , then the evolution along the keldysh contour brings the system back to the initial state . in this case",
    "the partition function is automatically normalized to unity , @xmath68 . to get a nontrivial result for physical quantities one has to consider the generating functional for the source fields having _ quantum _ components which are different on the upper and lower parts of the contour .",
