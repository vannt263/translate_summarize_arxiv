    "entanglement is one of the most familiar phenomena resulting from the presence of non classical correlations between quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "a large number of studies have demonstrated that entanglement can be created in variety of systems ranging from simple systems such as single photons or atoms to more complex systems such as spin chains or biological samples .",
    "the presence of an entanglement between systems has been tested experimentally in various optical experiments .",
    "for example , slowly moving atoms can be entangled while passing through a cavity  @xcite , and the entanglement between the atoms can be detected by probing the atomic state of the atoms after leaving the cavity  @xcite .",
    "another common setup is the entanglement of photons obtained from a down - conversion process  @xcite . in this case , the entanglement between the photons can be verified , e.g. , by detecting correlations between their polarizations  @xcite .    apart from the issue of creating entanglement , also a detailed analysis of the dynamics of an entangled system is of importance .",
    "one motivation for this is the possibility for transferring entanglement between distant quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "such transfers have become especially interesting since a number of experiments have succeeded in the creation of quantum gates necessary for the implementation of quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "however , if one examines the dynamics of an entangled system coupled to a network of quantum systems , it becomes apparent that the unavoidable coupling of the systems to the external environment can lead to the irreversible loss of the transferred entanglement . in this connection",
    ", one would expect that the coupling of the systems to local environments , with a markovian assumption of the process , could lead to an exponential decay of the entanglement from its initial value . however , there are some entangled states , particularly those involving at least two excitations , that may decay in an essentially non - exponential manner resulting in the disappearance of the entanglement in a finite time .",
    "this effect , known as sudden death of entanglement ( sde ) , has been studied in a numerous number of papers  @xcite , and has recently been observed in experiments involving photons  @xcite and atoms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , theoretical treatment of the coupling of sub - systems to a common ( non - local ) environment has predicted that the already destroyed entanglement could suddenly revive  @xcite or initially separable systems could become entangled after a finite time , the phenomenon known as sudden birth of entanglement  ( sbe ) .    from experimental point of view",
    ", in particular the study of the generation of entanglement in systems confined within optical or microwave cavities  @xcite is of importance .",
    "cavities provide a well - defined mode spectrum and a relatively loss - free environment such that the atom - field interactions can have anomalously large coupling strengths , leading to reversible , non - markovian type dynamics of the system . as a consequence",
    ", the already dead entanglement can revive even if in the equivalent free - space situation no revival is predicted  @xcite .",
    "however , calculations based on deriving the master equation for the reduced density operator of two atoms , both placed inside a cavity , frequently assume a large distance between the atoms such that there is no direct interaction between them .",
    "at the same moment the treatments assume that each atom influences the other instantaneously . for this",
    ", there is no time delay or equivalently no phase difference between the oscillating atomic dipole moments resulting in an effective coupling between the atoms independent of their distance .",
    "it turns out that these non - retarded models to physical systems are suitable if the atoms interact with a single cavity mode .",
    "a more interesting parameter regime arises if the atom couples to a large number of cavity modes . in this case ,",
    "retardation effects become important  @xcite .",
    "these effects are associated with a finite time required for light to travel , e.g. , from the atom to the boundary of the cavity and back to the atom after being reflected from the cavity mirror .",
    "this leads to the interference between instantaneously emitted photon and the retarded waves that are reflected from the cavity walls .    in an early study milonni and knight",
    "@xcite discussed the effect of the retardation on the collective behavior of two atoms .",
    "they demonstrated that that retardation effects in the interaction between two atoms in free space become important for distances larger than the half - wavelength of the field .",
    "recent studies of the interaction of atoms with multi - mode cavities have predicted strong non - markovian and retardation effects in the population dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the multi - mode cavity field can be treated as a small environment to the atoms  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a spatial modulation of the field amplitude which significantly alters the nature of the interaction between the atoms and the field .    while most of the studies on sde and sbe assumed the markovian approximation such that a backaction of the environment on the atoms is effectively excluded , recently",
    ", however , also the non - markovian case has received considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "in particular those explicitly taking into account the distance between the particles are of relevance  @xcite . in these works",
    "it was shown that for certain initial states , the distance between the qubits can qualitatively change the entanglement dynamics .",
    "for example , depending on the distance , sde and sbe can occur or not . however , these works made use of a continuum of environmental modes by integrating over all wave vectors @xmath0 .",
    "this raises the question about the entanglement dynamics of atoms in multi - mode cavities with a set of discrete field modes , which are known to exhibit strong non - markovian and retardation effects in the population dynamics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of retardation on the generation and dynamics of entanglement between two two - level atoms located inside a ring cavity .",
    "the model studied requires that we develop a multi - mode theory of the interaction of the atoms with the cavity field .",
    "the goal then is to trace the time evolution of the concurrence in the case of single or double excitations present in the system .",
    "we show that the quantum nature of the cavity field crucially affects the generation of entanglement in the system .",
    "in the course of the calculation we observe that the retardation effects do play a significant role in the creation of entanglement between the atoms .",
    "certain transient effects such as abrupt kinks in the time evolution of the populations and the concurrence occur .",
    "the kinks reflect the effects of multiple photon exchange between the atoms and appear at intervals corresponding to the multiplets of time required for the photon to travel between the atoms or to take the round trip in the cavity .",
    "the effect of the retardation on the phenomena of sudden death , revival and sudden birth of entanglement is also discussed . in particular , we identify parameters and initial conditions , in which the atoms remain separable without retardation throughout the entire evolution time , but exhibit sudden birth and death of entanglement with retardation , and vice versa",
    ". both , the short - time and the long time dynamics are analyzed , and we also study time - averaged concurrences .",
    "we also study the distance dependence on two scales : first , in integer multiples of the wavelength , corresponding to different positions in a periodic potential , and second on a sub - wavelength scale .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ theo ] by introducing the model and derive the equations of motion for the probability amplitudes in two cases of single and double excitations present in the system .",

    "we also present there the qualitative discussion of the short and long time behaviors of the concurrence . finally , in sec .  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "we consider two identical atoms , located inside a ring cavity at fixed positions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with distance @xmath3 .",

    "two identical two - level atoms are at fixed positions , distant @xmath7 from each other , located inside a one - dimensional ring cavity of the round trip path @xmath8 .",

    "the cavity is considered as a multi - mode cavity with frequency difference between adjacent modes ( free spectral range ) such that multiple modes are supported within the atomic resonance line width .",
    "the consideration of several rather than a single mode in the interaction of the atoms with the cavity field will be found crucial for the occurrence of retardation in the radiative coupling between the atoms .",
    "the hamiltonian of the atoms interacting with the common electromagnetic field of the ring cavity can be written as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the free hamiltonian of the atoms , @xmath13 is the free hamiltonian of the cavity field , and @xmath14 is the interaction between the atoms and the cavity field , written in the electric dipole approximation .    in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ,",
    "the atoms are represented by the transition dipole moment operators @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the dipole raising and lowering operators of the atom @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the dipole matrix element of the atomic transition .",

    "our objective is to find effects of the retardation in the interaction of the atoms with the multi - mode cavity field on the evolution of the system .",
    "we are in particular interested in the effect of the retardation on the creation of entanglement between the atoms .",
    "two cases will be studied , with the system initially ( 1 ) in a single excitation state , and ( 2 ) in a double excitation state . before going into detailed calculations ,",
    "we first briefly explain how retardation effects are incorporated in our calculations .",
    "the atom - cavity system exhibits retardation effects if its dynamics is affected by the finite propagation time of the light . in our model ,",
    "two effects need to be distinguished  @xcite .",
    "first , an atom embedded in a larger cavity initially evolves as in free space , but after a finite time of order @xmath35 ( and integer multiples thereof ) reacts to the presence of the cavity with a sudden kink in the time evolution .",
    "speaking pictorially , this time is required for a photon emitted by the atom to cycle through the cavity and be reabsorbed by the same atom .",
    "this gives rise to retardation effects which occur already for a single atom in the cavity .",
    "the second effect is due to the interaction of two atoms in the cavity . here",
    ", the retardation occurs because of the finite time required for a photon to travel between the two atoms .     denotes the position of atom 1 which is placed at the first anti node . ( a ) single mode of the cavity field with three different positions for atom 2 .",
    "( b ) two additional modes shown in blue and green are taken into account . ]    in the following , we provide an intuitive picture how the distance information required for the two different retardation effects enters our model . this discussion will be made more precise in sec .",
    "[ case - single ] , where we identify the origin of the two types of retardation in the equations of motion governing the atom - cavity system .",
    "a typical representation of the interaction of an atom with a cavity field is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ modes ] . evaluating the electric field operator ( [ eq6 ] ) in the heisenberg picture to include the time evolution , we find @xmath36 the time and space dependence enters via the phases @xmath37 of the different modes . in the last step and throughout this section , we assume a one - dimensional problem , and thus @xmath38 for simplicity .",
    "let us first discuss a simplified model , the interaction of the atom with a single mode only , say the central cavity mode @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ modes](a ) .",
    "suppose now that atom @xmath40 represented by a red blob is located at position @xmath41 , whereas atom @xmath42 , represented by a blue blob can be located at three different positions @xmath43 and  @xmath44 .",
    "it is easily verified that if @xmath7 is displaced by @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , where @xmath30 is an integer , then the phase of the single mode remains unchanged , @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that the electric field operator has the same value at positions differing by an integer multiple of the cavity wavelength .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath48 remains the same if the distance between the two atoms is changed by an integer multiple of the wavelength . in this sense ,",
    "the system dynamics is independent of the distance , and thus the system itself can not exhibit effects of retardation if only a single mode is considered .",
    "it should be noted that the interaction hamiltonian still depends on the relative distance between the atoms . for atomic separations @xmath49 and @xmath50 that are equal to multiple integer of the wavelength , @xmath51 , since at these separations the rabi frequencies have the same value . in other words ,",
    "the atoms are coupled equally to the field mode .",
    "but for separations between the atoms that do not satisfy the periodicity condition , such as @xmath52 , the atoms experience different amplitudes and phases of the field . as a consequence , the interaction @xmath48 is modified due to to a change of the rabi frequency",
    "however , this variation of the interaction hamiltonian with the inter atomic distance in the single mode field has nothing to do with retardation .",
    "let us now assume that apart from the central mode , there are additional cavity modes taking part in the interaction with the atoms , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ modes](b ) .",
    "suppose that at point  @xmath53 , all modes have the same phase ( @xmath54 for all @xmath30 ) , which we for simplicity assume to be zero .",
    "then , the position @xmath7 entering the field operator can be interpreted as the distance @xmath55 between the two atoms . due to their different wave numbers",
    "@xmath56 , at point  @xmath57 , the modes typically have different phases , i.e. , @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the modes are shifted or  retarded \" with respect to each other .",
    "this means that the atom at position @xmath57 experiences the field emitted by atom 1 into the different cavity modes with different relative phases , such that the response of atom 2 in the limit of large mode number averages out .",
    "however , at specific times , all modes can evolve in phase again . from the definition of @xmath60 ,",
    "it is clear that this happens at times @xmath61 , i.e. , exactly the times corresponding to the flight time of light between the two atoms . at this instance in time , the cavity modes act in phase onto atom 2 , such that a sudden response is observed .",
    "this is the origin for the retardation effects of the second type .",
    "in contrast , the retardation effects of the first type are embedded in the quantization of the cavity modes frequency spectrum .",
    "the frequency spacings are such that the phases at times separated by integer multiples of @xmath35 are different by an integer multiple of @xmath62 , as @xmath63 .",
    "while at most times the different modes are out of phase because of the different free evolution frequencies , at times equal to integer multiples of @xmath35 all modes are in phase again , and a sudden response of the atom appears . from this interpretation , it is apparent that this first type of retardation already occurs for a single atom .",
    "a straightforward combination of both arguments also explains the retardation of the second type at times @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , in the subsequent evolution of the atoms also combinations of the different retardation time intervals can occur , as we will see in the numerical analysis .",
    "thus , retardation effects are expected to play an important role in the interaction of atoms as soon as multiple modes with different wave numbers interact with the atoms .",
    "this can also be related to the fourier relation of position and momentum space .",
    "the small frequency distribution of a single mode gives rise to a large distribution or uncertainty in the position .",
    "in contrast , a broad frequency distribution or many modes allow to precisely determine the position .",
    "we are interested in determining the effect of retardation on the time evolution of the system initially prepared in separable states of single and double excitations . in particular",
    ", we shall discuss the subsequent time - dependent behavior of the excitation probabilities and the concurrence .",
    "the time evolution of the system is governed by the schrdinger equation , which in the interaction picture is given  by @xmath65 we will consider two particular classes of initial conditions . in the first , we assume that at @xmath66 the system was in a single - excitation state . in the second class , we assume that initially two excitations were present in the system . in both cases , the ( single or double ) excitation is initially either present in the atoms or in the cavity , or in a superposition of atoms and cavity .      if we take for the initial state of the system a single - excitation state , then the time - dependent state vector of two atoms coupled to a multi - mode field can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the state of the cavity modes with a single excitation present in the mode @xmath22 and zero occupation numbers for all the remaining modes .",
    "the time evolution of the state vector is determined by the schrdinger equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) which transforms it into three coupled equations of motion for the probability amplitudes    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the detuning of the cavity mode frequency @xmath71 from the atomic transition frequency @xmath10 coinciding with the central cavity mode frequency , and we have simplified the notation @xmath72 .    the formal integration of eq .",
    "( [ eqofmotion3 ] ) gives @xmath73 and when this relation is substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eqofmotion1 ] ) , we find @xmath74    at this point , the two types of retardation effects are fully visible also from the analytical expressions",
    ". the first type leading to retardation effects at times equal to integer multiples of the cavity round trip time @xmath35 can be understood in terms of the detunings @xmath75 . since the detunings @xmath76 differ by integer multiples of @xmath77 , the phases @xmath78 will be multiples of @xmath62 for all modes @xmath22 simultaneously at times @xmath79 equal to integer multiples of @xmath35 .",
    "then , the system response will exhibit sharp peaks due to the constructive interference of all modes . at other times",
    ", the different phase factors of the various modes do not add up constructively .",
    "this discrete response is independent of the coupling between the atoms , and could be observed even if only a single atom is present inside the cavity .    the second type of retardation is due to the interaction between the atoms , i.e. , the second part of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath80 together with the detuning phase lead to phase contributions @xmath81 = i \\omega_\\mu [ ( x_j - x_j')/c - t]$ ] for the different modes . again",
    ", constructive interference is obtained , but in this case at a time corresponding to the flight time @xmath61 between the two atoms .",
    "a similar argument also explains constructive interference at time @xmath64 .",
    "subsequent iterations of the two types of retardation lead to kinks in the system evolution also at times arising from combinations of the two effects .",
    "obviously , constructive interference can only lead to sharp change in the system response if many different frequency components contribute , i.e. , if the system couples to many cavity modes . in the extreme case of free space , @xmath82 , and the first type of retardation can not occur at a finite time .",
    "but the retardation in the coupling between the two atoms is still present in the free - space limit , and must be considered , e.g. , in calculating the dipole - dipole coupling between atoms in free space .",
    "if initially the system was in a double excitation state , then the state vector can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the state of the cavity modes with double excitation of the mode @xmath85 and zero occupation numbers for all the remaining modes .",
    "the schrdinger equation transforms the state vector ( [ extstatevec ] ) into the following set of coupled equations of motion for the probability amplitudes @xmath86 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\dot{b}_{\\alpha\\alpha}(t ) = & -2i\\delta_{\\alpha}b_{\\alpha\\alpha}(t)-\\sqrt{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2}g^{*}_{\\alpha j}b_{\\alpha j}(t ) .\\label{eqofmotion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the case of double excitation is described by a complicated set of equations of motion .",
    "it involves probability amplitudes of the states with the excitation redistributed over two cavity modes , @xmath87 , as well as states with the excitation occupying the same mode @xmath88 .",
    "we are mainly interested in studying the retardation effects on the entanglement dynamics between the two atoms that are coupled to the multi mode vacuum field inside the cavity .",
    "the dynamics of the atoms are determined by the reduced density matrix @xmath89 that is obtained by tracing the density matrix of the total system over the field degrees of freedom .",
    "we then exploit concurrence introduced by wootters  @xcite , which is a widely accepted measure of entanglement between two qubits , and is defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the eigenvalues ( in descending order ) of the hermitian matrix @xmath92 in which @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 is a pauli matrix .",
    "the concurrence ranges between 0 and 1 .",
    "if the two atoms are maximally entangled , the concurrence evaluates to unity whereas , if they are completely disentangled , @xmath96 .",
    "the usual way is to express the concurrence in the basis of the product states of the two - atom system , i.e. , @xmath97 . in this basis , the concurrence takes the form  @xcite @xmath98 there are two terms contributing to the concurrence , one resulting from the presence of the one - photon coherence @xmath99 and the other from the two - photon coherence @xmath100 .",
    "it is interesting that these two contributions complement each other . in the single excitation case , @xmath101 , and then the expression for",
    "the concurrence ( denoted in this case by * c * ) reduces to @xmath102 it shows that in the single excitation case it is sufficient for @xmath99 to be different from zero to create entanglement between the atoms . in this sense ,",
    "entanglement is equivalent to atomic coherence in this case .",
    "the situation is quite different when two excitations are present in the system .",
    "but surprisingly , tracing the density matrix of the system over the field degrees of freedom results in an expression for the concurrence that does not involve the two - photon coherence @xmath103 . to see this more explicitly , we calculate the density matrix @xmath104 associated with the two - excitation state eq .",
    "( [ extstatevec ] ) , and find @xmath105 where @xmath106 stands for the sum of all off - diagonal terms in the field modes which vanish in tracing over the cavity modes .",
    "then , by taking trace of the density matrix @xmath104 over the cavity modes , we arrive at the following reduced density matrix of the two atoms @xmath107 it is clear that tracing out the field modes results in the density matrix with @xmath108 . in this case , the concurrence denoted by @xmath109 takes the form @xmath110 which in terms of the probability amplitudes can be written as @xmath111 where @xmath112 similar to the single excitation case , the concurrence depends on the coherence @xmath113 .",
    "however , in the presence of two excitations in the system , the condition for a nonzero concurrence of @xmath114 is a necessary one , it is not in general sufficient one , since there is a subtle condition of the coherence to be larger than a threshold value of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the presence of the two excitations in the system introduces a threshold for the coherence above which the entanglement between the atoms could occur .",
    "needless to say , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq27 ] ) , @xmath116 , must be different from zero and exceed the second term numerically for the concurrence to be positive .",
    "we should point out here that the involvement of only the one - photon coherence in the concurrence of the double excitation case is a direct consequence of the quantum nature of the field .",
    "the definite total excitation number entangles the excitation number of the atoms uniquely to the excitation number of the cavity .",
    "if the cavity is projected into particular excitation number channels with classical probabilities not allowing for quantum superpositions in tracing over the cavity modes , due to this entanglement , also the atoms are projected into the corresponding excitation number subspaces .",
    "this rules out coherence or even entanglement between atomic states of different excitation number .",
    "this situation was treated by yonac _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who showed that in the case of a two mode cavity , @xmath117 , no coherence and equivalently no entanglement can be found in a system determined by the double excitation state ( [ extstatevec ] ) .",
    "the coherence could be present if one includes an auxiliary state @xmath118 , the ground state with no excitation , to the state ( [ extstatevec ] ) .",
    "then , the total excitation number would not be fixed , and there would be no definite entanglement between the atom and cavity excitation numbers . alternatively , if the photon number states in eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) were replaced by a classical field amplitude , for example , by a coherent state @xmath119 , one could then arrive at the concurrence involving the two - photon coherence @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the condition for entanglement based on @xmath120 would become relevant .",
    "it is easy to see , replacing in eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) the photon number states @xmath121 by the coherent state @xmath119 , we obtain a state vector @xmath122 using @xmath123 from eq .",
    "( [ extstatevec - coherent ] ) , one can calculate the density matrix @xmath124 .",
    "now @xmath125 it is seen that the resulting density matrix element containing contributions from the two - photon coherences no more vanishes .",
    "this is consistent with our interpretation , as a coherent state has a distribution of photon numbers rather than a well - defined occupation as a fock state .",
    "having discussed the general features of the concurrence , we now turn to analyze the transient behavior of the populations and concurrence for initial conditions in which the atoms are prepared in separable single or double excitation states and for an initial condition in which the atoms are initially in a partially or a maximally entangled state .",
    "we shall allow for an arbitrary atomic spacing and length of the cavity , but we limit the discussion to situations in which the central cavity mode is on resonance with the transition frequency of the atoms , i.e. , @xmath126 .",
    "also , since the coupling of the atoms to the cavity modes decreases with increasing detuning , we take into account in the numerical calculation a finite number of cavity modes distributed about @xmath127 with a frequency range on the order of several atomic line widths .",
    "the required number of modes depends on the cavity length @xmath8 , as the distance between the adjacent cavity modes decreases with increasing  @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the number of the cavity modes to which the atoms can be coupled increases with an increasing  @xmath8 .    equations ( [ conc . ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) for the concurrence are functions of several parameters : the atomic spacing @xmath7 , the detuning of the cavity modes from the atomic transition frequency @xmath76 , the number of the cavity modes @xmath128 to which the atoms are coupled , the coupling strength of the atoms to the cavity modes @xmath129 , the cavity length @xmath8 , and the time @xmath79 . for fixed @xmath128 and @xmath8 , one can obtain time evolution of the concurrence by monitoring the populations of the atomic states and coherence between the atoms as a function of @xmath79 .",

    "( [ eq38 ] ) is associated with the one - photon coherence determined by both , unequal populations of the collective states and the coherence between them , whereas the second line is attributable to the two - photon populations of either the atomic system , determined by @xmath232 , or the cavity modes , determined by @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "thus , the mechanism for entanglement with two excitations initially present in the atomic system is similar to that of the single excitation case .",
    "entanglement between the atoms , @xmath235 , can be traced back to the single - excitation sub - space , and in particular imbalances between the symmetric and the anti - symmetric singly - excited atom states . however , in contrast to the single excitation case , this asymmetry must exceed the threshold set by the contribution from the systems with both excitations either in the atoms or in the cavity .",
    "the entanglement seen in figs .",
    "[ sde](b ) ,  [ sde7](b ) and  [ sde2](b ) indicates that the retardation effects lead to a non - zero population difference between the symmetric and antisymmetric states that at some periods of time overcomes the threshold factor in the expression for @xmath202 .",
    "what this means is that the time evolution of the atoms is not linked to the total cavity population .",
    "in particular , if one excitation is in the cavity , the other excitation can be in different atomic states with varying population imbalance between symmetric and anti - symmetric states .",
    "the above investigations have shown that the presence of the retardation effects leads to a non - sinusoidal evolution of the concurrence which results in the phenomena of sudden death and sudden birth of entanglement .",
    "one can notice from figs .",
    "[ sde](b ) ,  [ sde7](b ) and  [ sde2](b ) that there are finite periods of time at which @xmath202 is negative .",
    "these are dead zones of entanglement or equivalently at that times the atoms are separable .",
    "the following question then arises : in which states , entangled or separable , do the atoms spend most of the time ? to answer this question ,",
    "we first extend the calculations of @xmath202 to long times and then average @xmath202 over a long evolution time .",
    "we concentrate on the case illustrated in fig .",

    "( b ) the concurrence averaged over a long evolution time is shown as a function of the atomic spacing @xmath7 .",

    "( b ) the concurrence averaged over a long evolution time is shown as a function of the atomic spacing @xmath7 .",
    "the distance @xmath7 varies around half of the cavity length , over an interval of one half of the cavity wavelength.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the corresponding long - time dynamics of @xmath202 is shown in fig .",
    "[ result4](a ) .",
    "it is seen that the time evolution of @xmath202 is very spiking with the amplitude of the fast oscillations slowly modulated in time .",
    "it can also be noticed that the amplitude of @xmath202 oscillates around @xmath238 which suggests that over a long period @xmath202 might average to zero or negative values .",
    "therefore , we calculate the mean value of @xmath239 by averaging over the evolution time @xmath240 for different inter atomic distances around a distance of half the cavity length , in an interval of half a wavelength @xmath195 . as expected , we find that depending on the inter - atomic separation the mean value of @xmath202 can be positive or negative .",
    "next , we average the more important concurrence @xmath203 itself in the same way .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ result4](b ) .",
    "the first atom is located at @xmath241 , and the second atom is located close to @xmath242 such that they are separated roughly by half of the cavity length .",
    "it is seen that the precise positioning of the atoms within a wavelength at such large distances plays a vital role in the entanglement between the atoms .",
    "the effect of going away from the @xmath200 position is clearly to decrease the amount of entanglement .",
    "but as expected , the concurrence is positive for all distances even in an average sense , due to the non - negative nature of @xmath203 .",
    "we have studied the effects of retardation on the entanglement properties of two atoms located inside a multi - mode ring cavity .",
    "retardation effects become pronounced if the mode spacing of the cavity is small enough such that the atoms can simultaneously couple to many modes of the cavity field . the schrdinger equation for the wave function of the system",
    "was solved for different atomic separations and initial conditions with single and double excitations present in the system .",
    "it was shown that the retardation effects are manifest not only in the dynamics of the atomic population but also in the dynamics of entanglement between the atoms . characterizing entanglement between the atoms by the concurrence",
    ", we have found that the retardation leads to abrupt kinks in the concurrence at intervals corresponding to the flight time of a photon between the atoms or to the time corresponding to a round trip in the cavity .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated that the retardation effects crucially depend on the atom separation both , on the multi- and sub - wavelength distance scale .",
    "we have also distinguished significantly different short - time and long - time retardation effects in the evolution of the concurrence . in particular , at short times the concurrence exhibits periodic sudden changes from separable to highly entangled states . at long times , the retardation gives rise to periodic beats in the concurrence that resemble the phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "we finally identified parameter values and initial conditions at which retardation qualitatively changes the entanglement dynamics . in particular , the atoms can remain either separable or entangled throughout the whole time evolution without retardation , whereas they exhibit the phenomena of sudden birth and sudden death of entanglement when the retardation is included .",
