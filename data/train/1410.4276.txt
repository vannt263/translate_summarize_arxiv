    "multiple testing ( mt ) and control of the false discovery rate ( fdr , benjamini:1995 ) has been conducted in a variety of scientific endeavours including the microarray study in @xcite and the analysis of spatial data in @xcite .",
    "it is very challenging to develop mt procedures with a desired fdr when the test statistics are strongly dependent .",
    "recently , @xcite considered mt in the following setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath1-dimensional normal random vector ( rv ) with mean @xmath2 and a known correlation matrix @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "given an observation @xmath5 of @xmath6 , the @xmath7th null @xmath8 versus its alternative @xmath9 is tested using @xmath10 and some @xmath11 $ ] such that @xmath12 is rejected if and only if @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the standard normal rv . to tackle this mt problem , @xcite proposed the technique of principal factor approximation ( pfa ) to decompose the dependence embedded in @xmath15 and used theorem 6 in @xcite together with the pfa to obtain the strong law of large numbers ( slln ) for the normalized number of conditional rejections @xmath16 for arbitrary @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the indicator of a set @xmath20 and @xmath21 are called by @xcite the `` principal factors''(see for more details ) .",
    "the slln for @xmath22 ( and that for another related quantity ) enables @xcite to derive an almost sure ( a.s . ) approximation to the false discovery proportion ( fdp , @xcite ) and it is considered a theoretical breakthrough in fdr control of mt under dependence .    unfortunately , we found that the arguments given by the authors of @xcite do not seem to be fully sufficient to yield the slln for @xmath23 for arbitrary @xmath17 and @xmath18 , mainly due to their delicate handle of the involved functional remainders in the taylor expansions and their use of some implicit assumptions to derive certain auxiliary asymptotic assertions . in this article",
    ", we will provide a complete justification of this law with clarifications on all needed assumptions . in",
    "we will revisit the technique of pfa and provide examples on different speeds of the pfa to components of the original rv . in , we will briefly review the strategy on the proof used in @xcite and point out the extra arguments needed to justify this law . in , we present our detailed proof .",
    "our reformulation provides an integrated view on how the speed of the pfa to @xmath6 , the dependence among @xmath24 s , and the magnitudes of @xmath25 s should interact with each other in order to validate this law .",
