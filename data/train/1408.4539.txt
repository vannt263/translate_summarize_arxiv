    "recently , wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) are used for many applications , e.g. health monitoring of buildings , factory automation , and energy management systems . for example , in building energy management system ( bems ) , numerous sensors are deployed in fields such as office room to observe environmental information , e.g. temperature , brightness , human detection , and so on .",
    "the information are gathered via wireless links and employed for saving power consumption .",
    "however limited life - time of sensors has long been an issue in wsns .",
    "conventionally , sensor s energy is supplied by electrical plug , battery or environmental energy , which respectively have the following disadvantages : limitation of installation placement , requirement of battery replacement , or lack of stability . to deal with the problem",
    ", we propose to introduce wireless energy transmission to wsns , in which sensors can be released from both wires and batteries and be stably supplied with energy .",
    "wireless energy transmission schemes are categorized into three types , i.e. radio wave emission , resonant coupling and inductive coupling @xcite . in the radio wave emission method ,",
    "energy is collected at the receiver ( rx ) using rectenna ( rectifying antenna ) to receive and convert radio wave into direct current .",
    "compared with the other schemes , long range transmission can be realized by increasing transmit power or antenna gain .",
    "space solar power satellite ( ssps ) is one of the examples of this scheme . in wsns ,",
    "numerous ubiquitous sensors are distributed in indoor environments . in order to supply energy to all of them ,",
    "the radio wave emission is employed in this paper .",
    "so far , radio wave emission technology has been mainly used for radio frequency identification ( rfid ) systems .",
    "however , rfid systems have not been designed for the wide - area coverage targeted in this paper . additionally , in passive rfid systems in which sensors do not have external battery ,",
    "radio wave is emitted only when reader / writers ( r / ws ) request tag data .",
    "consequently , sensors can not transmit the data on their own initiative .",
    "furthermore , in a single transmitter ( tx ) system , the coverage of energy supply field is restricted by maximum transmit power limited by the radio regulation . to extend the coverage ,",
    "multiple transmitters can be introduced to the systems .",
    "this , however , results in the collision between multiple transmitters . to avoid the collision while complying with the regulation , a collision avoidance scheme among multiple r / ws , e.g. time division multiple access ( tdma ) ,",
    "should be employed @xcite . however , employing tdma results in decreasing the time efficiency in terms of energy charging and increasing the system complexity in proportion to the number of introduced r / ws . on the other hand , if multiple transmitters simultaneously perform energy transmission , destructive interference between multiple wave sources results in deadspots where sensors can not be activated .",
    "this scheme is called simple multi - point in this paper .    to tackle these problems , we propose a system called the wireless grid to seamlessly supply wireless energy to sensors as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wg ] @xcite@xcite .",
    "grid nodes , located at ceilings or integrated in fluorescent lamps , continuously supply wireless energy to sensors to charge their rechargeable batteries , e.g. capacitor .",
    "this energy is utilized at the sensors for performing both environmental sensing and communication with the grid nodes .",
    "the wireless grid can expand the energy coverage due to our proposal of multi - point wireless energy transmission with carrier shift diversity .",
    "owing to the introduced carrier shift diversity , which was originally proposed for data communication @xcite@xcite , artificial fading can be created to cancel out deadspots by time averaging . by this way",
    ", wireless grid can seamlessly extend the coverage and supply energy to all sensors distributed in indoor environments .",
    "several companies and researchers have attempted introducing wireless energy transmission into wireless sensor networks by employing single - point rfid systems or harvesting the ambient rf power @xcite-@xcite . in these papers , @xcite proposed to transmit the special waveform to improve the coverage . @xcite",
    "employed two orthogonal polarization and narrowband frequency modulation to improve the uniformity of the power density in a metallic over - moded waveguide cavity . however , the single - point scheme is difficult to improve the coverage due to path - loss and multi - path .",
    "in addition , harvesting the ambient power depends on the environment . on the other hand , @xcite@xcite employed multi - transmitter or multi - antenna systems to improve the received power of certain sensors with fixed location by phase control on each antenna .",
    "different from these researches , this paper realizes seamless coverage of energy supply field to activate all sensors distributed in the indoor environments by the multi - point wireless energy transmission with carrier shift diversity .",
    "furthermore , as a proof of concept , we conduct indoor experiments , partially presented in @xcite , to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme . in our experiments , we compare the received power distribution as well as the coverage in a single - point scheme , a conventional multi - point scheme , and the proposed multi - point scheme in the same environment .",
    "the experimental results show that the proposed scheme can overcome power attenuation due to the path - loss as well as the effect of standing - wave created by multipath and interference between multiple wave sources . in",
    "particular , the maximum available value of required power to maintain 100% coverage in the proposed scheme is improved by 18 db compared with that in the single - point case .",
    "for the rest of this paper , sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] gives theoretical support for the benefits of the proposed multi - point wireless energy transmission .",
    "the theory is validated by both experiments in real indoor environment and simulations assuming free space in sec .",

    "[ sec:4 ] concludes this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig:950 ] shows the spectrum mask of 950 mhz band which is available for wireless energy transmission including uhf rfid systems . according to japanese regulation @xcite ,",
    "the maximum transmit power and the maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power ( eirp ) are respectively limited to 30 dbm and 36 dbm over an energy transmission channel of 200 khz bandwidth .",
    "there are four non - lbt ( listen before talk ) channels where transmission without carrier sensing is allowed . in our proposed wireless grid ,",
    "these four channels are all continuously and simultaneously employed for wireless energy transmission while the other channels are used for data communication .",
    "the 950 mhz band in japan has been reallocated for lte mobile systems while the 920 mhz band is now available for rfid systems with wireless energy transmission .",
    "it is noted that these four non - lbt channels are shifted to the 920 mhz band in the same format .    in the carrier shift diversity ,",
    "the center frequency of the carrier of each energy transmission point is slightly shifted with a predefined amount to create artificial fading .",
    "the time - varying fading shuffles the interference pattern between multiple wave sources with suitable selection of carrier offsets . in multi - point wireless energy transmission with carrier shift diversity ,",
    "the available frequency bandwidth of 200 khz is divided into @xmath2 orthogonal subcarriers and these subcarriers are respectively allocated to @xmath2 different wireless energy transmission points .",

    "figure  [ fig : mpc ] shows one example of power distribution when employing these three schemes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpc ]  ( a ) , the coverage of sp is limited by the maximum transmit power defined by the radio regulation .",
    "furthermore , in real environments , the effect of standing - wave created by multipath becomes more remarkable in the case when the power difference between the direct and reflected waves is small .",
    "this effect will also occur due to reflections from floor and ceiling when horizontal polarized waves are concerned @xcite . due to this effect , it is difficult to provide seamless energy transmission to sensor nodes since the sensor nodes might be located at the deadspots .",
    "for example , @xcite reported that r / ws in real rfid systems can not read ic tags even located at a distance shorter than the designed coverage of the product .",
    "to solve the coverage limitation due to path - loss in sp , additional transmission points can be introduced as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mpc ]  ( b ) and  ( c ) to enhance the area of energy supply field .",
    "however , merely increasing the number of energy transmission points does not solve the limitation of the coverage as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpc ]  ( b ) .",
    "the effect of interference between multiple wave sources can be avoided by applying a tdma scheme to mp .",
    "however , the time efficiency of energy supply decreases and the complexity of the system increases in proportion to the numbers of transmitters . to deal with the problem ,",

    "although the received power obtained from the @xmath21-th transmitter @xmath34 is independently affected by standing - wave caused by multipath , the probability that all of the received powers become deadspots is significantly small in comparison to the case of sp . it is noted that the artificial fading period @xmath35 should be smaller than the minimum period of data transmission @xmath36 to supply the average received power to the sensor ic .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 should satisfy the following inequality , @xmath37 in practical systems , since the effect of interference between multiple wave sources is reduced in proportion to the distance between transmitters , about 20 subcarriers might be sufficient for indoor environment .",
    "in addition , since the available frequency bandwidth @xmath6 is 200 khz , the duty cycle of sensor nodes should be more than 100@xmath38s which is sufficient to perform the transmission of sensing data .",
