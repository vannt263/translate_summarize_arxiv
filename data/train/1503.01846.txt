    "observations of the 21 cm transition of neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) with radio telescopes provide a unique probe of the cool gas in and around galaxies .",
    "most spirals possess an disk , typically around twice the size of the stellar component seen in visible light @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm line can trace large - scale tidal features  tails and bridges  which are evidence of past or on - going interactions between galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations therefore provide crucial information about the size , mass and structure of galaxies at different epochs , and are an essential tool for understanding how galaxies have evolved over cosmic time .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies allow us to observe these features directly , by their 21 cm emission - line .",
    "recent surveys such as the local volume survey ( lvhis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the nearby galaxy survey ( things , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have used radio interferometers to map the gas with high spatial and spectral resolution , allowing us to study the distribution and kinematics of the gas in unprecedented detail . however , such observations are time consuming , and can only be conducted for a relatively small number of galaxies .    at the other extreme ,",
    "large surveys with single dish telescopes provide a much broader picture of the local galaxy population , though without the resolution required for studying individual galaxies in detail .",
    "the parkes all sky survey ( hipass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) detected over 5000 galaxies at redshifts @xmath2 resulting in the most robust calculation of the mass function ( himf ) at that time @xcite .",
    "the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) currently being conducted with the 305 m arecibo telescope will extend this to higher redshifts , and has already detected 15,000 galaxies at redshifts @xmath3 .    however , the detectability of the 21 cm emission - line drops off rapidly with redshift and to date the most distant detection of a galaxy in emission is @xmath4 @xcite . stacking experiments , using optical redshift data ,",
    "allow us to make statistical detections in existing data which are not deep enough to detect individual galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this provides useful information about the average properties of galaxies but it is impossible to learn anything about the individual galaxies that have been stacked , and making detections at higher redshifts is still extremely difficult .    the 21 cm line can instead be detected in absorption , seen as a negative feature in the spectrum of a background radio continuum source .",
    "the detectability of the absorption - line is essentially independent of distance , provided there is a sufficiently bright background source against which to search .",
    "this makes it possible to study neutral gas at much higher redshifts than is possible in emission .",
    "intervening absorption occurs when a reservoir of gas is found along the sightline to an unassociated background continuum source .",
    "detections of intervening absorption are therefore relatively rare , since they require the chance alignment of the foreground gas cloud with a sufficiently bright background source . as a result , there have been limited attempts to conduct blind searches for intervening absorption , with most searches focusing on targeted observations of bright radio sources where the sightline is known to pass close to a foreground galaxy .    the largest blind absorption - line survey to date covers an area of 517 deg@xmath5 at redshifts @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "making use of the first alfalfa data , sightlines to 8983 radio sources were searched for absorption .",
    "they re - detected one associated absorption - line , but did not detect any intervening absorption - lines .",
    "upper limits on the column density were found to be consistent with previous estimates of the himf , and they conclude that higher sensitivity surveys will likely result in numerous absorption - line detections .    next - generation radio telescopes , with their unprecedented bandwidth , field - of - view , and sensitivity will make it possible to conduct the first large - scale blind absorption - line surveys",
    ". flash ( the ` first large absorption survey in ' ) is one such survey .",
    "flash will use the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to search for absorption along 150,000 sightlines , studying the evolution of neutral hydrogen in the redshift range @xmath7 ( look - back times of @xmath84 - 8 gyr ) .",
    "however , in order to relate absorption - line data to physical galaxy properties , at redshifts where emission - line data will not be available , we need to know how the detection rate of absorption varies with linear distance from the centre of the galaxy ( i.e. impact parameter ) .",
    "two recent surveys have attempted to address this question .",
    "@xcite searched for intervening absorption in five quasar galaxy pairs ( qgps ) with impact parameters of 11.0 - 53.0 kpc , and detected one absorption - line at an impact parameter of 11.0 kpc . combining their results with those in the literature",
    " 15 additional quasar sightlines from six different surveys  they estimate that there is a 50 per cent chance of detecting an absorption - line within 20 kpc of a galaxy , for integrated optical depths @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .    a complementary study searched for absorption in fifteen qgps at impact parameters of 1.7 - 86.7 kpc , making two new detections , at 1.7 and 2.8 kpc @xcite . in agreement with the @xcite results",
    ", it also appears that detections at impact parameters greater than 20 kpc are very rare .    here , we expand on previous work by conducting a targeted search for intervening absorption in a sample of nearby , gas - rich galaxies . by selecting low - redshift galaxies we are also able to map the target galaxies in , allowing us to directly relate the gas distribution to the absorption - line detection rate .",
    "the combined emission- and absorption - line data also allows us to put some constraints on quantities such as the spin temperature and covering factor of the gas , which can not be measured from absorption - line data alone .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a flat @xmath11cdm cosmology , with @xmath12 = 0.27 , @xmath13 = 0.73 , and @xmath14 = 71 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "all uncertainties refer to the 68.3 per cent confidence interval , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use the optical definition of the velocity ( @xmath15 ) throughout .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      in figure [ figure : gupta_comparison ] we plot the integrated optical depth against the impact parameter for each of the sightlines in our sample",
    ". for comparison , we also show results from previous intervening absorption - line surveys .",
    "the results shown comprise the list compiled by @xcite ( ) , as well as other more recent results @xcite .",
    "we note that , for surveys which include both radio galaxies and quasars , only the quasar sightlines are shown ( as per @xcite )  a point that we discuss in further detail below .",
    "@xcite estimated that there is a 50 per cent chance of making an absorption - line detection at impact parameters of 20 kpc or less , for integrated optical depths greater than 0.1 km s@xmath10 ( i.e. the upper left quadrant of figure [ figure : gupta_comparison ] ) .",
    "more recent results show similar detection rates .",
    "however , although all but one of our sightlines fall in this quadrant , we have not made any detections ( we note though that very narrow components such as that detected by @xcite would not be detectable in our survey due to the much lower spectral resolution . )    one likely explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the results of ours and previous surveys lies in the type(s ) of continuum sources used to search for absorption . in our sample only one of the background continuum sources is a known quasar , while the remaining sources are unclassified and therefore most likely to be radio galaxies ( a fact that is further supported by the double structure seen in a number of cases ) .",
    "in contrast , all of the literature results in figure [ figure : gupta_comparison ] are from quasar sightlines ( which provide very bright radio sources , ideal for targeted absorption searches ) .",
    "quasars are far more likely to be compact radio sources , compared with radio galaxies ( hence why they are frequently used for targeted absorption searches ) , and we might therefore expect that the detection rate along quasar sightlines would be higher . since , in the overall radio source population , only about 10 per cent of sources are quasars , our results may be more representative of the expected detection rate for blind absorption - line surveys , such as flash , in the future .",
    "the lack of detections in our sample at impact parameters @xmath1620 kpc therefore raises the question of whether the true detection rate expected for blind , unbiased samples would be as high as 50 per cent .",
    "expanding our sample size would allow us to investigate this effect further .",
    "although different surveys show different detection rates for impact parameters @xmath1620 kpc , it seems clear that the detection rate at impact parameters greater than 20 kpc is likely to be very low .",
    "the radial profiles presented in section [ results_part1:radial_profiles ] can provide further information about this . for our galaxies ,",
    "we find that the column density typically falls below the dla limit of 2 @xmath17 10@xmath18 at a radius of around 10 - 20 kpc ( see table [ table : hi_opt_disk_sizes ] ) .",
    "since these are the kind of gas - rich systems that flash , and other blind surveys , are most likely to detect , this again suggests that most of the detections made will be along sightlines with impact parameters of 20 kpc or less .",
    "upper limit on the integrated optical depth.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]",
    "we have conducted a targeted search for intervening absorption in six nearby , gas - rich galaxies , using observations with the atca . by targeting nearby galaxies we obtained both emission- and absorption - line data , allowing us to directly relate the neutral gas distribution to the absorption - line detection rate .",
    "we have produced the first resolved maps of the target galaxies .",
    "we find that four of the sightlines searched intersect the disk at column densities above 1 - 2 @xmath17 10@xmath18 @xmath19 , however , no absorption was detected . from analysis of the emission - line maps ,",
    "we conclude that the non - detections for three of these four galaxies are simply because the background sources are too faint to detect absorption in the current integration times .    for the fourth galaxy , ngc7424 we obtain a limit of @xmath0 @xmath20 5700 k , which explains why we have not detected any absorption , despite the high column density along this sightline .",
    "we suggest that the actual spin temperature may not be significantly higher than normal if the covering factor is low due to a clumpy medium .",
    "limits obtained for the remaining galaxies in our sample typically yield estimates of @xmath8100 - 200 k , consistent with the expectation for normal spiral galaxies , and with other recent results .    many of the background sources in our sample became extended , or resolved into multiple components in the high resolution atca images , reducing our absorption - line sensitivity .",
    "plots of the ` absorption - line detectable region ' illustrate how dramatically this can affect the probability of detecting absorption , particularly in the outer parts of the disk , and also highlight the effect that background source structure might have on the detection rate of future large absorption - line surveys . given the relatively low spatial resolution of existing all - sky radio surveys , other methods for estimating the compactness of continuum sources , such as spectral index properties ,",
    "should be investigated , in preparation for future surveys .",
    "our detection rate is low compared with that of previous surveys , and we find that this may be explained by differences in the type(s ) of radio sources targeted by different surveys .",
    "samples targeting quasar sightlines , which form the majority of surveys to date , would be expected to have a higher detection rate , as quasars are normally very compact , maximising the absorption - line sensitivity . given that our sample consists mainly of radio galaxies , which as we have seen above are often more extended , it is perhaps not surprising that our detection rate is lower .",
    "since quasars represent only about 10 per cent of the overall radio source population , we suggest that our results may therefore be more representative of the expected detection rate for large , blind absorption - line surveys in the future .",
    "given our small sample size , however , further observations would be required to confirm whether this is the case .",
    "radial profiles of the target galaxies provide additional information about the extent of the disks .",
    "we find that the column density typically drops below the dla - limit ( 2 @xmath17 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ) at a radius of 10 - 20 kpc , suggesting that the majority of detections in future blind surveys will be at impact parameters of 20 kpc or less .",
    "this is consistent with absorption - line results to date , which show detections at impact parameters greater than 20 kpc to be extremely rare .",
    "future work including an expanded sample , and vlbi observations would allow us to better quantify the expected detection rate , and the effect of background source structure for the next generation of absorption - line surveys .",
