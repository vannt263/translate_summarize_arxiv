    "the concept of holography , especially the ads / cft correspondence , has now been the most powerful tool to analyze quantum aspects of gravity @xcite .",
    "since there have been no satisfactory and non - perturbative formulations of string theory , the direct calculations of quantum gravity effects often turn out to be quite difficult .",
    "however , the ads / cft equivalently transforms the problems into those in non - gravitational theories , typically large @xmath0 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "since the latter ones are non - perturbatively well defined , we can in principle understand all quantum gravity effects at least in ads spaces",
    ".    in spite of enormous related developments , the ads / cft in time - dependent backgrounds have not been well understood at present .",
    "one of purposes of this paper is to understand better somewhat puzzling aspects of entropy in time - dependent backgrounds , which is also closely related to the black hole information problem @xcite . if we suddenly excite a cft , it will eventually thermalize after a certain time . in ads",
    "/ cft , this is dual to a black hole formation in ads spaces @xcite . in a probe d - brane approximation ,",
    "a thermalization is dual to a black hole formation in the induced metric on the brane @xcite .",
    "in such a process , it is clear that the density matrix of the system is described by a time - dependent pure state in the cft side , assuming that we start with a pure state before the thermalization .",
    "therefore , the von - neumann entropy is always vanishing . on the other hand , in the ads gravity ,",
    "since the black hole will be formed and the spacetime at late time is well approximated by the ads schwarzschild black hole , the entropy seems non - vanishing .",
    "for example , it is clear that the entropy which appears in the fluid description gets non - vanishing @xcite .",
    "this might suggest an evolution of a pure state into a mixed state , which contradicts with the principle of quantum mechanics . to resolve this issue",
    ", we need to distinguish the microscopic von - neumann entropy from a coarse - grained entropy .",
    "only the latter can get non - vanishing in this thermalization process .",
    "we will argue that the entanglement entropy @xcite offers us a convenient coarse - grained entropy in holographic setups . at the same time",
    ", we will show that the von - neumann entropy of the total system is always vanishing in the black hole formation process employing the holographic calculation of the entanglement entropy @xcite .    from the cft viewpoint ,",
    "the black hole formation process is dual to a problem of non - equilibrium dynamics and therefore is quite complicated to analyze explicitly in general .",
    "fortunately , recently there have been many progresses in understanding of properties of quantum field theories after thermalizations induced by instantaneous excitations called quantum quenches @xcite .",
    "we will consider a two dimensional cft defined by a free dirac fermion on a circle and calculate the time - evolution of the entanglement entropy and correlation functions after a quantum quench , taking into account the finite size effect .",
    "indeed , the behavior of the entanglement entropy we obtained implies that its gravity dual is supposed to be successive creations and annihilations of black holes in ads spaces , though a free field theory in general corresponds to an extremely stringy region of the gravity side .",
    "this solvable example offers us a cft description of a black hole formation and decay , which are manifestly free from the black hole information problem , because the system is clearly described by a pure state .",
    "notice that in this problem , the standard thermal entropy is not useful as it is vanishing and the entanglement entropy is an alternative important quantity which can directly probe black holes .",
    "we would also like to mention that quite recently , remarkable numerical calculations of time evolutions of entanglement entropy have been done holographically in @xcite .",
    "when we essentially finished calculations for this paper , we found the paper @xcite , which has a partial but important overlap with ours about the argument which shows unitary evolutions of cfts dual to the black hole formations by using the holographic entanglement entropy . a similar issue has also been discussed independently in the appendix of the paper @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section two , we will explain a puzzle on the entropy in time - dependent backgrounds and resolve it by employing the entanglement entropy as a coarse - grained entropy . in section three",
    ", we will calculate the time evolving entanglement entropy in two dimensional cft of a free dirac fermion with finite size effect .",
    "we will interpret our results from the gravity dual viewpoint and relate them to the black hole creations and annihilations . in section four , we will study one and two point functions in our time - dependent cft and confirm that they agree with our holographic interpretation . in section five , we will summarize our conclusion . in the appendix",
    "a , we present detailed calculations of two point functions in a free dirac fermion theory on a cylinder using the boundary state formalism .",
    "consider holography in time - dependent backgrounds , especially the ones in ads / cft .",
    "we are particularly interested in a situation where a black hole horizon is created by a gravitational collapse .",
    "such a time - dependent process has been considered to be dual to thermalizations and indeed we can construct explicit examples in ads / cft setups @xcite , where non - normalizable perturbations lead to a creation of hot plasma fluid in the dual yang - mills theory .",
    "similar phenomena also occur in the probe d - brane setups regarding the thermalization as a formation of horizon in the induced metric @xcite",
    ".    an important characteristic physical quantity in time - dependent systems will be the entropy .",
    "since the black hole is created after a certain time in our gravity background , it is quite natural that the entropy which is holographically calculated , gets non - vanishing at late time .",
    "however , in the dual cft , the time evolution is described by a time - dependent external force in quantum many - body systems and thus the density matrix @xmath1 of the total system will evolve in a unitary way @xmath2 . since the entropy of the total system is defined by the von - neumann entropy s_tot(t)=-[(t)(t)]=s_tot(t_0 ) , which is clearly time - independent .",
    "therefore if we start with a pure state , then the entropy is always vanishing at any time , even if the black hole horizon appears in the dual geometry .",
    "this observation seems to lead to a contradiction between the gravity and cft at first sight .",
    "another confusing point is that there is no known unambiguous definition of entropy @xmath3 in the time - dependent gravity duals .",
    "this is partly because there are two different notions of horizons : event horizon and apparent horizon .",
    "currently , there are several evidences that the latter will be more appropriate to define entropy @xcite .",
    "however , still we need to specify the choice of time slices to calculate the apparent horizon and thus there are infinitely many different definitions",
    ". remember that in static spacetimes , the time slice is uniquely chosen and there is no ambiguity .",
    "a closely related issue in the dual cft side is that we can define a non - vanishing entropy even for a pure state if we perform a coarse - graining of the given total system .",
    "if the total system consists of a gas and a heat bath , then the entropy of gap is obtained by tracing out the heat bath and by the required coarse - graining due the fact that our observables are quite restricted compared with the microscopic degrees of freedom ; see e.g. @xcite for relevant quantum field theoretic formulations .",
    "again this leads to infinitely many different definitions of ( coarse - grained ) entropy .",
    "below we would like to resolve the above puzzle by paying attention to this coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the resolution of this puzzle is also closely related to that of the black hole information loss problem .",
    "this problem occurs since a massive object described by a pure state collapses into a black hole and finally ends up with a thermal gas generated by hawking radiations , which looks like a mixed state .",
    "if this is true , a pure system has to evolve into a mixed state after enough time and clearly contradicts with the principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "typically the coarse - graining is done by cutting out higher energy modes or higher order multi - particle interactions . however",
    ", this does not seem to allow straightforward calculations in ads / cft setup .",
    "therefore , here we would like to perform a coarse - graining by cutting out a spacial part of the total system . in this case , the obtained entropy coincides with the quantity called entanglement entropy .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath4 is defined for each subsystem @xmath5 of the total system . in quantum field theories , @xmath5 is specified by diving the total space at a fixed time @xmath6 into two parts named as @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus the number of choices of @xmath8 are obviously infinite .",
    "the total hilbert space @xmath9 now becomes a direct product @xmath10 , where the subsystem @xmath11 is the complement of @xmath8 .",
    "the reduced density matrix for @xmath8 at any time @xmath6 is given by _",
    "a(t)=_h_b_tot(t ) .",
    "finally we define the entanglement entropy as follows s_a(t)=-[_a(t)_a(t ) ] .",
    "this quantity is in general non - vanishing and a non - trivial function of time even for pure states .",
    "we can calculate @xmath4 via ads / cft by applying the holographic formula proposed in @xcite , which generalizes the holographic formula in static spacetime found in @xcite .",
    "it is simply given by s_a(t)= , where @xmath12 is the newton constant of the ads space .",
    "the surface @xmath13 is a codimension two surface in the ads space which is defined by the extremal surface whose boundary coincides with the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "we require that @xmath13 is homotopic to @xmath5 .",
    "if there are more than one such extremal surfaces , we pick up the one with the lowest area , as is required by the strong subadditivity of entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "note that here we need to directly deal with lorentzian spacetime without its euclidean counterpart because it is time - dependent .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , it was confirmed that such extremal surfaces are well - defined in important examples .",
    "recently , this formula is applied to the ads@xmath14 vaidya background and the conformal field theory results in @xcite have been remarkably reproduced in the work @xcite . moreover , this calculation has been extended to the higher dimensional cases in @xcite .    for our purpose , it is convenient to study a @xmath15 dimensional time - dependent background which is asymptotically global ads@xmath16 space , which includes a finite size effect because its boundary is @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that a black hole is produced at a certain time via a gravitational collapse and this process lasts only for a finite time .",
    "our argument below is heuristic and does not depend on the detailed form of the time - dependent solution .",
    "we calculate @xmath18 at a time @xmath6 when the black hole formation has been ended and when the spacetime is well approximated by a static ads black hole .",
    "first we assume the length size of @xmath8 ( denoted by @xmath19 below ) is smaller than the inverse temperature @xmath20 of the ads black hole temperature .",
    "in this case , the extremal surface @xmath13 is localized near the boundary and surrounds the region @xmath5 @xcite . @xmath18",
    "essentially consists of the area law divergent piece s_a~+ .... , [ area ] which are independent of the temperature .",
    "notice that the condition @xmath21 assumed here physically means that the system is heavily coarse - grained .",
    "as @xmath19 exceeds @xmath20 , @xmath18 gains a finite and extensive contribution , which is essentially the thermal entropy for the subsystem @xmath8 , in addition to the divergent part @xmath22 given by ( [ area ] ) .",
    "this thermal contribution comes from the part of the surface @xmath13 which is wrapped on a part of the apparent horizon of the ads black hole and thus is proportional to @xmath19 as in fig.[bhf ] ; see @xcite for explicit confirmations .",
    "an important fact is that though the apparent horizon requires the choice of the time slice , our extremal surface @xmath13 is uniquely determined by the boundary condition .",
    "when this reaches the point @xmath23 , the situation begins to change importantly .",
    "if we naively speculate the surface @xmath13 in a continuous way until @xmath19 exceed @xmath24 , we may think that it will wrap on a more than half of the apparent horizon as in the right - up figure of fig.[bhf ] .",
    "however , since the horizon disappears at an earlier time , we can smoothly deform this surface into the one which wraps the opposite part of the horizon .",
    "therefore the result of @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 becomes symmetric with respect to the point @xmath23 as in the right - down figure of fig.[bhf ] .",
    "in other words , we can conclude that in this time - dependent background the entanglement entropy satisfies s_a = s_b , which is indeed known to be true when the total system is a pure state and thus agrees with our holographic setup .",
    "this sudden decreasing of the entanglement entropy occurs because the subsystem @xmath11 which we are tracing out gets smaller than the half of the total system and the information lost by the coarse - graining starts recovering .    in the end",
    ", we can holographically calculate the von - neumann entropy for the total system as follows s_tot=_|b|0 ( s_a - s_b)=0 .",
    "[ entroth ] thus , in the gravity side , we confirmed that the total entropy is always vanishing in spite of the black hole formation .",
    "as is clear from the previous argument , the essential point is that the horizon is time - dependent and gets vanishing at earlier time and the minimal area principle ( among extremal surfaces ) prefers the minimum i.e. @xmath25 at any time . in summary , in the time - dependent background which describes a thermalization of a pure state , the von - neumann entropy of the total system is indeed vanishing also in the gravity side .",
    "this contrasts strikingly with the setup of an eternal ads black hole @xcite as it is dual to a mixed state in a thermal cft and has a non - vanishing thermal entropy , which precisely coincides with the value @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the non - zero entropy is obtained only after a certain coarse - graining . among various such entropies defined in the dual cft",
    ", only the entanglement entropy has its clear holographic dual in time - dependent backgrounds at present . from this viewpoint",
    ", we can define a coarse - grained effective entropy @xmath27 which looks analogous to the thermal entropy by s_eff=2(s_a - s_a^(0))|_|a|=|b| .",
    "[ effe ] we subtracted the entanglement entropy @xmath28 before the thermalization .",
    "this clearly includes the divergent part @xmath22 given by ( [ area ] ) and therefore @xmath27 is finite .",
    "the reason why we put the factor two is @xmath8 covers only a half of the total system .",
    "we would like to argue that ( [ effe ] ) is a definition of coarse - grained entropy which is uniquely calculable both in gravity and cft side of the ads / cft .",
    "notice that though the calculation of entropy from an apparent horizon requires the choice of time slice and is ambiguous , our entropy @xmath27 has no ambiguity as the extremal surface condition of @xmath13 determined where the surface wraps the apparent horizon .    finally , we would like to come back to the relation to the black hole information problem @xcite . from the above argument , it is clear that there is no information loss in the gravitational collapsing process because @xmath25 is always satisfied .",
    "however , we can not study the most important process of the decay due to hawking radiations because the absence of the holographic formula of entanglement entropy beyond the supergravity approximation .",
    "therefore , for this purpose , it is a better idea instead to study its cft dual , directly .",
    "we will analytically investigate such an example in the next section .",
    "for the holographic calculation of entanglement entropy in the ads black formation ( left ) .",
    "though for an eternal ads black hole we have @xmath29 ( upper right ) , in our case of black hole formation , we actually find that @xmath30 ( lower right ) .",
    "this is because the horizon vanishes at early time.,height=264 ]",
    "in the previous section , we studied the behavior of coarse - grained entropy by using the holographic entanglement entropy . in this section",
    ", we would like to complete the argument by presenting an explicit calculations with a finite size effect in two dimensional cft and by showing that the results agree with the holographic ones .",
    "we would like to analyze how the entanglement entropy evolves in time - dependent backgrounds which describe the thermalization phenomena . at the same time , this offers us a toy gravity dual of a black hole formation and evaporation , where there is no information loss problem and where we can solve the model exactly .",
    "we will particularly look at a specific class of time - dependent system which is called quantum quench , whose field theory descriptions have been given in @xcite .",
    "the quantum quench is a phenomenon when we suddenly change parameters of a given system such as masses and coupling constants .",
    "the evolutions of entanglement entropy under quantum quenches have been studied in @xcite for infinitely extended systems .    to make an exact calculation possible , we consider a free dirac fermion theory in two dimension . in free field theories ,",
    "the thermalization via the quantum quench is not a standard one described by the ( grand-)canonical ensemble because the different momentum modes are decoupled and do not mix @xcite .",
    "notice also that the free cft corresponds to string theory with a lot of quantum corrections via the ads / cft .",
    "nevertheless , this system is enough for our purpose qualitatively as we will see later . as far as the authors know",
    ", our result will be the first analytical calculation of time - dependent entanglement entropy with a finite size effect .",
    "the calculation of entanglement entropy at finite temperature and with finite size has been calculated in @xcite for a free dirac fermion .",
    "the setup of quantum quench that we have in mind is as follows .",
    "start with a dirac fermion theory with a mass @xmath31 in two dimension . then at the time @xmath32 ,",
    "suddenly we turn off the fermion mass . then the system after this quantum quench i.e. @xmath33 will be described by a time - dependent background in the @xmath34 2d cft defined by a massless dirac fermion",
    "whose hamiltonian is written as @xmath35 .",
    "if we denote the state just after the quench by @xmath36 , then the density matrix at a time @xmath33 is given by _",
    "tot(t)=e^-ith|_0_0| e^ith . to find @xmath36 we would like to follow the prescription in @xcite .",
    "we expect that in the infrared limit @xmath36 should flow into a boundary fixed point . therefore we can approximate @xmath36 by a boundary state @xmath37 with the uv modes filtered out |_0e^-h|b , where @xmath38 is the parameter of uv filter and is inversely proportional to the original fermion mass @xmath39 .",
    "if we denote the uv cut off or lattice spacing of this field theory by @xmath40 , we need to take @xmath41 , which is clearly satisfied in the continuum limit @xmath42 .    in this way",
    "we find that the reduced density matrix is eventually written as _",
    "tot(t)=e^-ith - h|bb| e^ith - h .",
    "[ totd ]    in the path - integral description @xcite , the spacetime where the dirac fermion lives is the cylinder geometry given by the direct product of an interval ( i.e. euclidean time ) and a circle ( i.e. space ) .",

    "due to its conservation law , this clearly becomes time - independent .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the energy density @xmath94 of the left - moving oscillator @xmath95 from ( [ totd ] ) as follows _ n=_-n_n= .",
    "[ onep ] this indeed obeys the bose - einstein distribution with the effective temperature estimated in ( [ teff ] ) .",

    "the total energy density in the @xmath84 limit can be found as usual @xmath97 .",
    "even though we confirmed that our system is thermalized , we can not find signals of black hole creation and annihilation from the time - independent one point function ( [ onep ] ) .",
    "motivated by this we would like to calculate another one point function which is not dual to any conserved quantities .",
    "especially we consider the one point function @xmath98 for the dirichlet boundary state for the initial state @xmath36 , where @xmath99 can take only integer values as we set @xmath63 . after a calculation similar to the appendix",
    "a , we finally obtain ( we set @xmath100 ) e^ikx(t,0)=. as is clear from the plot in fig.[oneplot ] , it has peaks at @xmath101 .",
    "this behavior is actually natural from our interpretation in terms of black hole creations and annihilations .",
    "as the result of the entanglement entropy suggests , a black hole is created at @xmath32 and reaches its maximal size at @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the radiations from the black hole will be the most strong at @xmath103 , remembering the periodicity @xmath104",
    ". they will reach at the ads boundary after the propagation time : @xmath105 as @xmath106 . in the presence of black holes",
    "one may think that the propagation time of a massless particle will be changed .",
    "indeed , in a semiclassical black hole , this happens and affects the structures of singularities of two point functions @xcite .",
    "however , we do not consider this modification as we are interested in a region in gravity where quantum corrections are so large that the even horizon does not seem to be defined using a metric .",
    "] @xmath107 .",
    "this explains the peaks of @xmath108 since the one point function is dual to the value of bulk scalar field near the ads boundary and its square should be proportional to the strength of radiations .",
    "notice that this non - vanishing one point function is peculiar to time - dependent black holes .",
    "this is because the one point function , which is holographically dual to a classical radiation , is vanishing in the static thermal cft .     as a function of @xmath6 at @xmath90 and @xmath109.,height=188 ]",
    "the another reason that we are interested in time dependent correlation functions is because we would like to discuss the information loss problem of black holes @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it has been argued that information loss problem is dual to the quasinormal behavior ( exponential decay ) of time dependent two point functions in a large n gauge theory at finite temperature : @xmath110.\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is a positive real constant .",
    "these behavior breaks the unitarity of the theory because this shows that any fluctuations that we add to the initial state will eventually vanish . in the same papers ,",
    "it has also been conjectured in a finite @xmath0 gauge theory , the decay of the correlation stops at the value of order @xmath112 $ ] , then correlation grows , and repeats this behavior because of the poincare recurrence of the theory .",
    "indeed , this quasinormal behavior can be seen in our model .",
    "if we set @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 in the two point functions ( [ eq : zetton ] ) for the neumann boundary condition , we find @xmath116    in fig.[gtplot ] , we show the plot of @xmath117 .",
    "it has the periodicity @xmath44 as a signal propagates from @xmath100 and it has to go back to the same point . the divergences at @xmath118z come from the usual short distance behavior of the operator product .",
    "if @xmath119 , we can find the following exponential behavior of @xmath117 @xmath120,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a certain time - independent function @xmath121 .",
    "due to the @xmath44 periodicity , after @xmath117 gets decreased exponentially , it reaches its ( non - zero ) minimum at @xmath122 and then again begins to increase .",
    "finally , it is also intriguing to study the time evolution of the two point function with separated points @xmath123 for neumann boundary condition .",
    "if we use the formula ( [ eq : zetton ] ) of appendix a , and set @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we have @xmath126    in fig.[ftplot ] , we plot @xmath127 .",
    "the graph shows that the correlation becomes strong when @xmath27 is large ( compare with fig.[figeet ] ) .",
    "this can be regarded as a further evidence of the successive productions and annihilations of quantum black holes in our system .     as a function of t at @xmath90.,height=188 ]     as a function of @xmath6 at @xmath90.,height=188 ]",
    "in the first part of this paper , we pointed out a puzzle . because a thermalization process in the cft side should be unitary , the von - neumann entropy of the final state must remain vanishing . on the other hand , in its gravity dual , we seem to have non - vanishing entropy as the final state includes a black hole .",
    "these observations look contradict with each other .",
    "however this is not the case .",
    "we showed that even in the gravity side , the von - neumann entropy of the final state is zero by using the property @xmath128 of holographic entanglement entropy for an arbitrary pure state .",
    "we proved this by making use of the fact that the apparent horizon of the black hole vanishes in the past .",
    "we then proposed a direct generalization of thermal entropy by using the entanglement entropy . from a holographic point of view",
    ", this quantity seems reasonable because @xmath129 is essentially proportional to the area of the apparent horizon of the corresponding black hole .",
    "nevertheless , if quantum corrections are taken into account , one might think that the entropy of the final state in the gravity dual can be also nonzero due to the hawking radiation .",
    "this observation is closely related to the information loss problem . in the latter part of this paper",
    ", we calculated the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a quantum quench .",
    "especially , we considered two dimensional dirac fermions on a cylinder .",
    "the result shows that the von - neumann entropy is always vanishing and the coarse - grained entropy @xmath130 is oscillating as a function of time .",
    "this offers us a clear toy holographic dual of a formation and decay of black holes , which is free from the information problem .",
    "we interpreted this fact as the successive productions and annihilations of quantum black holes .",
    "we also studied the behavior of one and two point functions and confirmed that they support this interpretation .",
    "we found that the two point functions can not be zero and is periodic in time which shows some recurrence of our free system .    *",
