    "finding ways to detect a heavy higgs boson or longitudinal weak boson scattering at the lhc is an issue of highest importance as long as the nature of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking remains to be established .",
    "over the past few years considerable work has been devoted to this topic and several techniques have been proposed to separate the signals from large backgrounds due to qcd processes and/or the production of @xmath6 bosons from the decay of top quarks . in order to identify weak boson scattering , @xmath7 the electroweak subprocess @xmath8 , tagging of at least one fast forward jet",
    "is essential  @xcite .",
    "early studies  @xcite showed that double tagging is quite costly to the signal rate because one of the two quark jets has substantially lower median @xmath9 ( order 30 gev ) than the other ( order 80 gev ) .",
    "single forward jet tagging relies only on the higher @xmath9 tag - jet and thus proves an effective technique  @xcite .",
    "a study of the @xmath10 signal must exploit additional identifying characteristics .",
    "for example , the @xmath6 bosons from top quark decays can be rejected by vetoing the additional central @xmath11 quark jets arising in @xmath12  @xcite . in case of the decay",
    "@xmath13 another important discriminator is a large transverse momentum difference between the charged leptons  @xcite .    in a weak boson scattering event",
    "no color is exchanged between the initial state quarks .",
    "color coherence between initial and final state gluon bremsstrahlung then leads to a suppression of hadron production in the central region , between the two tagging jet candidates of the signal  @xcite .",
    "it was hoped that the resulting rapidity gaps ( large regions in pseudorapidity without observed hadrons apart from the higgs decay products ) could be used to select signal events . however , at lhc energies the low signal cross sections require running at high luminosity and then overlapping events in a single bunch crossing will likely fill a rapidity gap even if it is present at the level of a single @xmath14 collision .    in the present paper , we argue that the rapidity gap idea may be rescued at lhc energies if we look for gaps in minijet production rather than gaps in soft hadron production .",
    "the gluon radiation in background events is hard enough to lead to a characteristic minijet pattern which provides an experimentally accessible measure of the color flow in the underlying hard event .",
    "qualitatively , extra parton emission is suppressed by a factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the typical scale of the hard process and @xmath17 is the minimal transverse momentum required for a parton to qualify as a minijet . the jet transverse momentum scale below which multiple minijet emission must be expected is set by @xmath18 . in the background processes for a heavy higgs boson",
    "the relevant hard scale may be as large as the higgs mass ( _ i.e. _ @xmath19 invariant mass ) .",
    "setting @xmath20  tev , @xmath21 may be expected for @xmath22 .",
    "multiple minijet emission at such a high scale should be observable even in a high luminosity environment and therefore be useful as an event selection criterion .    as a case study to quantify these arguments , we consider the decay mode @xmath13 of a heavy higgs boson ( typically @xmath23  gev ) .",
    "our first goal is to make a more reliable estimate of the typical transverse momentum scale and the rapidity range at which individual background events develop a high probability for minijet activity .",
    "second we establish that such minijets are unlikely to be observed in signal events .",
    "hence , a veto on these minijets should constitute a powerful tool to isolate a heavy higgs boson or more generally a weak boson scattering signal .",
    "finally , we give numerical results for a typical search strategy at the lhc .",
    "we demonstrate that backgrounds may be reduced well below the signal level while retaining a sizable signal ( 80 events for @xmath23 gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath24 ) if a minijet veto above @xmath25  gev is possible .",
    "at least two features of soft parton emission in a hard process must be reliably modeled in order to answer the questions raised above : i ) the color flow of the hard process and the ensuing color coherence of the soft radiation needs to be taken into account .",
    "ii ) the hard scale @xmath16 , which determines the transverse momentum region where multiple minijet emission sets in , must be determined dynamically .",
    "both requirements are satisfied by a full evaluation of tree level matrix elements , including the radiation of one additional soft parton .",
    "fortunately , monte carlo programs for all the necessary signal and background simulations exist already .",
    "since we are interested in heavy higgs boson production , a simulation using the narrow higgs width approximation is inadequate .",
    "instead we evaluate the full electroweak subprocesses @xmath26 ( and corresponding crossing related ones ) including all @xmath6-bremsstrahlung diagrams .",
    "the @xmath6 decays are generated in the narrow width approximation .",
    "for the lowest order case with no gluon emission ( n = 0 ) we use the calculation described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to determine the soft parton radiation pattern for the signal we calculate the signal cross section for n = 1 gluon as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all cases",
    "we choose the scale @xmath16 of the structure functions and of @xmath27 to be the smallest individual parton transverse momentum in the final state .",
    "for all processes we use mrsa structure functions  @xcite and we set @xmath28 .    a forward tagging jet , well separated from the @xmath6 decay leptons , will be part of the signal definition . even in the top quark background such an additional jet will almost always be produced by qcd radiation and not by the @xmath11-quark arising in @xmath12 decay .",
    "hence the lowest order @xmath1 background is given by subprocesses like @xmath29 the corresponding simulation ( called @xmath30 monte carlo in the following ) is based on the cross section formulas given in ref .",
    "when considering the minijet activity , the top background needs to be determined with one additional parton in the final state and we use a tree level @xmath31 monte carlo program ( @xmath32 monte carlo ) which includes the subprocesses @xmath33 and all crossing related ones , but which neglects pauli interference terms when identical quark flavors are appearing in the six quark process  @xcite . neglecting",
    "pauli interference is an excellent approximation since we are interested in the phase space region where the two final state massless partons have very different transverse momenta and energies . in both the @xmath30 and @xmath32 monte",
    "carlos the top quark and @xmath6 decays are simulated in the narrow width approximations .",
    "in addition , energy loss from unobserved neutrinos in semileptonic @xmath11-quark decays is simulated by appropriately decreasing the 3-momentum of the corresponding jet . in both programs",
    "the minimal @xmath34 of the final state partons , prior to top quark decay , is chosen as the scale of the structure functions .",
    "for the overall strong coupling constant factors we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ( where @xmath37 ) .",
    "the top quark mass is set to @xmath38  gev throughout .",
    "similar to the top quark background , the qcd @xmath19 background is simulated with @xmath39 to @xmath40 final state quarks or gluons and is generated by a full evaluation of all @xmath41 tree level subprocesses  @xcite .",
    "full 1-loop corrections are only known for inclusive @xmath19 production and we effectively include them by a factor @xmath42 for the @xmath39 process  @xcite .",
    "this large @xmath43-factor is partially due to the emergence of new subprocesses at the @xmath44 level and therefore is not used for the @xmath44 and @xmath40 simulations .",
    "the @xmath6 decays are again treated in the narrow width approximation , the strong coupling constant factors are taken as @xmath45 , @xmath7 each @xmath46 is evaluated at the transverse momentum of the corresponding final state parton , and the smallest @xmath34 of the @xmath6 s or jets is taken as the structure function scale .    below we will be interested in using the higher order programs ( which include emission of soft partons ) in regions of phase space where the @xmath47 jet cross section saturates the rate for the hard process with @xmath48 jets . as the @xmath9 of the softest jet",
    "is lowered to values where @xmath49 , fixed order perturbation theory breaks down and multiple soft gluon emission ( with resummation of collinear singularities into quark and gluon structure functions , etc . )",
    "needs to be considered in a full treatment .",
    "these refinements are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "instead we employ the truncated shower approximation ( tsa ) to normalize the higher order emission calculations  @xcite .",
    "the tree - level @xmath50jet differential cross section @xmath51 is replaced by @xmath52 with the parameter @xmath53 properly chosen to correctly reproduce the lower order @xmath48  jet cross section when integrated over a given phase space region of this hard process . here",
    "@xmath54 is the smallest transverse momentum of any of the final state massless partons .",
    "as @xmath55 the final factor in eq .",
    "( [ reg ] ) acts as a regulator .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath1 production the top and bottom quark transverse momenta are not included in the regularisation .",
    "before discussing the minijet activity in signal and background events we first need to define the event selection in terms of requirements on hard leptons and jets .",
    "the purpose of these hard cuts is twofold : i ) to reduce the various backgrounds while keeping a large fraction of signal events and ii ) to make sure that the surviving background processes give very hard scattering events which will have a large transverse momentum scale for additional minijet activity .",
    "we are interested in the decay of a very heavy higgs boson , or , equivalently , in weak boson scattering at large center of mass energy and in the @xmath56 partial wave . in either case",
    "the two charged @xmath6 decay leptons will emerge with high transverse momentum , in the central region of the detector , and they will be well isolated .",
    "thus we require the presence of two charged leptons ( @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 here @xmath59 denotes the lepton transverse momentum and @xmath60 is its pseudorapidity .",
    "the @xmath61 separation cut forbids a parton ( jet ) of @xmath62  gev in a cone of radius 0.7 around the lepton direction .",
    "the lepton @xmath9 cut in eq .",
    "( [ cut1a ] ) is not in itself sufficient to focus on the production of two @xmath6 s of large transverse momenta and large @xmath6-pair invariant mass .",
    "a variable which helps to substantially suppress @xmath6 bremsstrahlung backgrounds is @xmath63 , the difference of the charged lepton transverse momentum vectors  @xcite .",
    "we thus require @xmath64 the additional cut on the dilepton invariant mass removes possible backgrounds from @xmath65 leptonic decays .",
    "it is largely superceded by the the @xmath63 cut , however .",
    "cross sections for events satisfying the lepton acceptance criteria of eqs .",
    "( [ cut1a],[cut1b ] ) are listed in the first column of table  i for the case of a @xmath23  gev higgs boson and the @xmath2 and @xmath1 production backgrounds . the weak boson scattering cross section for @xmath66  gev gives the electroweak background which is still contained in the @xmath23  gev line .",
    "thus the signal cross section is defined as @xmath67 .",
    "the 2.2  fb signal for @xmath23  gev retains about 50% of the total higgs boson signal , with the reduction largely due to the stringent @xmath63 cut .",
    "the @xmath68 signal is further characterized by the presence of two forward quark jets .",
    "typically only one of them emerges at substantial transverse momentum and hence we use single forward jet tagging .",
    "the tagging jet candidate is defined as the parton with the highest transverse momentum which satisfies the general jet definition criteria @xmath69 here the jet - jet separation cut is the parton level implementation of a jet definition cone with a radius of 0.7 in the legoplot .",
    "the tagging jet candidate is further required to fulfill @xmath70 while the signal can still be simulated at lowest order , we must include emission of an extra parton , @xmath7 consider @xmath71 and @xmath30 production in order to get a reliable background estimate .",
    "for the @xmath72 cross section the tagging jet is occasionally one of the @xmath11-quark jets which results in a singular behavior of the cross section as the @xmath9 of the extra parton approaches zero .",
    "this unphysical behavior is eliminated by using the tsa ( see eq .",
    "( [ tsa ] ) ) with @xmath73  gev which matches the @xmath72 cross section to the @xmath1 cross section within the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cut1a],[cut1b ] ) . as can be seen by comparing the entries of the first two columns of table  1 , requiring the presence of a tagging jet",
    "suppresses the backgrounds by about 1 order of magnitude while reducing the signal by 45% .",
    "this signal reduction is mostly due to the @xmath74 and @xmath75 requirements , which when taken alone , account for signal losses of about 0.4  fb and 0.6  fb respectively .",
    "since the @xmath9 distribution of the tagging jet is relatively soft for longitudinal weak boson scattering , one may contemplate relaxing the @xmath74 cut if sufficient background reduction can be achieved by the minijet veto to be discussed later .",
    "another feature of the @xmath68 signal is the wide separation in pseudorapidity of the two final state quark jets from the leptons which arise in the higgs boson decay . imposing a minimal lepton tagging - jet separation",
    ", @xmath76 reduces the backgrounds by more than a factor 2 , with little loss for the signal ( see table  i ) .",
    "the hard cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cut1a][cut3 ] ) define a trigger which selects events like the one sketched in the legoplot of fig .",
    "[ figlego ] .",
    "this trigger is about 22% efficient for a @xmath23  gev higgs signal while reducing the qcd @xmath19 background to an acceptable level .",
    "top production still drowns the signal , but can be suppressed by exploiting the @xmath11-quark jet activity . in a previous study it was shown that a veto on the centrally produced @xmath11 quark jets above @xmath77  gev is extremely effective in removing the @xmath1 background  @xcite , but we have to be careful since at such low transverse momenta the production of minijets via the emission of additional gluons can not be neglected at the lhc .",
    "in order to study the minijet activity in the various processes we use the tsa and match @xmath78 to the lower order results within the hard cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cut1a][cut3 ] ) .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath79  gev for @xmath80 and @xmath81  gev for @xmath82 . for the weak boson scattering process @xmath83 , slightly different values of @xmath53",
    "are needed to match the @xmath66  gev and @xmath23  gev cross sections in the third column of table  1 .",
    "since this would lead to an incomplete subtraction of the electroweak background when determining the signal cross section @xmath84 we choose instead to match the @xmath23  gev signal rate of 1.02 fb in table  i which is achieved by setting @xmath85  gev .",
    "the @xmath53 parameter indicates the typical scale of minijet production .",
    "we therefore expect that moderate @xmath9 minijet emission is much more likely for the backgrounds than for the signal process .",
    "the characteristic features of the additional jet activity , beyond the tagging jet , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] .",
    "the pseudorapidity distributions of the jet closest to the lepton center @xmath86 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figtwo](a ) . here",
    "@xmath87 with the sign factor chosen such that the rapidity difference is counted as positive if the second jet is on the same side of the lepton center as the tagging jet ( see fig .  [ figlego ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figtwo](a ) shows that emission of additional partons takes place in very different angular regions for the signal as compared to the backgrounds . in a @xmath88 weak boson scattering event",
    "no color is being exchanged between the two scattering quarks which emerge in the forward and backward region .",
    "color coherence between initial and final state radiation then leads to suppressed emission between these two jets . due to the large @xmath10 invariant mass the decay products of the two @xmath6 s emerge in the central region , however , and thus the additional jet activity is well separated from the charged leptons . indeed the signal distribution , as given by the difference between the @xmath23  gev ( solid ) and the @xmath66  gev ( dashed ) curves in fig .",
    "[ figtwo](a ) , is strikingly different from that of the backgrounds .",
    "the emission of soft gluons occurs mainly outside the interval defined by the two quark jets  @xcite .",
    "consequently the jet closest to the lepton center is usually the second quark jet and not the soft gluon .",
    "this explains the asymmetric @xmath89 distribution in fig .",
    "[ figtwo](a ) : the large peak at negative values is due to the second quark jet .",
    "gluon emission occuring close to the tagging jet and hence at positive @xmath89 will rarely produce the jet closest to the two leptons .",
    "in contrast to the signal the two background processes largely proceed by color octet exchange between the two incident partons and color coherence results in parton emission mainly in the central region . in @xmath1 production",
    "this effect is further enhanced by the @xmath11 decay jets which can not be too widely separated from the leptons since both arise from top quark decays .",
    "a veto against this central jet activity will clearly lead to a strong background reduction .",
    "figure  [ figtwo](b ) shows the probability to find at least one veto jet candidate above a certain minimal transverse momentum and in the vicinity of the leptons , @xmath90\\;\\ ; { \\rm or } \\;\\ ; [ \\eta_j^{\\rm tag},\\eta_\\ell^{\\rm max}+1.7]\\ ; , \\ ] ] ( see shaded area of fig .  [ figlego ] ) .",
    "this probability is determined by integrating @xmath91 and normalizing the result to the corresponding lower order cross section @xmath92 within the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cut1a][cut3 ] ) .",
    "the difference in veto probability between the @xmath23  gev signal and the two background processes is striking . in @xmath1 production",
    "the veto candidate is usually one of the @xmath11 quarks ( @xmath93 probability for @xmath94  gev ) . in both @xmath1 and qcd @xmath19 production , minijet emission due to qcd radiation sets in at much larger transverse momenta than in the signal .",
    "this minijet @xmath9 scale is about one to two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath16 , the momentum transfer to the color charges which are accelerated in the hard scattering process . for the signal @xmath16 is the virtuality of the scattering weak bosons , @xmath95 while the appropriate scale for the backgrounds is at least @xmath96 or @xmath97 . as a result",
    "a given probability for minijet emission is reached at 5 to 10 times larger @xmath9 scales in the backgrounds than in the signal .    in the truncated shower approximation only one soft parton",
    "is generated , with a finite probability to be produced outside the veto region of eq .",
    "( [ cutveto ] ) .",
    "the veto probability will therefore never reach 1 , no matter how low a @xmath98 is allowed . at small values of @xmath98",
    "we thus underestimate the veto probability because the tsa does not take into account multiple parton emission . in",
    "the soft region gluon emission dominates and one may assume that this soft gluon radiation approximately exponentiates . a rough estimate of multiple emission effects is thus provided by @xmath99\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the unregularized @xmath47  parton cross section is integrated over the veto region of eq .",
    "( [ cutveto ] ) and then normalized to the lower order cross section , @xmath92 . for the qcd @xmath100 background",
    "the result of this exercise is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figtwo](b ) .",
    "it confirms the observations made before but the deviations from the tsa result also demonstrate the need for a quantitative calculation of the veto probability .",
    "the prime concern of a veto strategy is to retain a high acceptance of signal events .",
    "color coherence in the hard @xmath68 process leads to an almost complete absence of gluon radiation between the two quark jets  @xcite and hence to a rapidity gap in the distribution of hadrons which result from these soft gluons . in order to observe such a gap ,",
    "however , no other sources of soft hadrons can be allowed , either from overlapping minimum bias events in a single bunch crossing at high luminosity or from the underlying event in a single @xmath14 collision . in the minijet model",
    "the latter is parameterized in terms of multiple parton scattering and only a few percent ( given by the survival probability , @xmath101 ) of the signal events are expected to be free of multiple interactions  @xcite .",
    "given the small weak boson scattering cross sections at the lhc ( of order 100  fb ) , such a small signal acceptance makes a `` traditional '' rapidity gap selection infeasible .",
    "we have seen above that the different gluon radiation patterns which are at the heart of a rapidity gap trigger become apparent in the distributions and the rate of minijets in the 2050  gev transverse momentum range .",
    "we are thus lead to define the rapidity gap trigger in terms of minijets instead of soft hadrons .",
    "then the survival probability of the signal is determined as the complement to the probability that a minijet with @xmath102 occurs in a random bunch crossing ( overlapping events ) or in the underlying event accompanying the hard scattering process . in both cases",
    "the survival probability is given by @xmath103 here @xmath104  mb )  @xcite for minijets produced in the underlying event and @xmath105^{-1 } = 4 $ ]  mb for overlapping events in a single bunch crossing at a luminosity of @xmath106 .",
    "with single - jet cross sections of about 0.8  mb ( 2  mb ) above @xmath107  gev in the rapidity range of eq .",
    "( [ cutveto ] ) the signal acceptance loss due to minijets in the underlying event appears to be acceptable down to transverse momenta of order 1015  gev while at @xmath106 overlapping events may produce random jets above 20  gev @xmath9 with about 20% probability .",
    "this estimate agrees with the results of a more detailed analysis of overlapping events at the lhc  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall assume that a veto on minijets with @xmath94  gev is feasible with little loss to the signal rate .",
    "actually , it should be possible to significantly lower this transverse momentum cut .",
    "central tracking may allow one to separate the @xmath108-vertex position of the hard trigger leptons from the interaction point of the minijet if the latter arises from an overlapping event .",
    "assuming that the lhc interaction region will be about 10  cm long  @xcite a @xmath108-vertex resolution of the charged tracks inside the minijet of a few mm should suffice .",
    "clearly , these questions should be addressed in experimental simulations .",
    "here we just want to emphasize that an elimination of minijets from overlapping events and hence a lowering of @xmath98 would greatly enhance background rejection with very little damage to the signal rate .",
    "an estimate of the background reduction which can be achieved by vetoing additional jets above @xmath94  gev is demonstrated by the last column in table  1 .",
    "the minijet veto reduces the qcd @xmath10 background to a negligible level while leaving a @xmath1 background of about 0.5  fb .",
    "notice that the top production background would be a factor two larger had we not taken into account the extra emission of soft partons in the @xmath31 @xmath32 production process .",
    "another measure of the background reduction is provided in fig .",
    "[ figdelptll ] where we show the distribution in the lepton transverse momentum difference @xmath63 , after our minijet veto . a cut at @xmath109  gev instead of the 300  gev chosen in eq .",
    "( [ cut1b ] ) would further reduce the background .",
    "however , trying to make a more stringent minijet veto experimentally feasible may be the more promising strategy .",
    "the angular distribution and the typical momentum scale of the minijet activity provide a powerful tool to distinguish the color structure of hard scattering events . in @xmath110-channel color singlet exchange , such as weak boson scattering events , there is a suppressed central minijet activity and the minijets in higgs boson events typically carry transverse momenta well below 20  gev . in contrast , backgrounds such as qcd @xmath19 or @xmath1 production involve the @xmath110-channel exchange of color octet gluons .",
    "this leads to strong minijet activity at central rapidities with @xmath11150  gev , which should be identifiable even in the high luminosity environment of the lhc .",
    "essentially , a minijet veto corresponds to a rapidity gap search at the semihard parton level which results in a large signal acceptance ( or survival probability ) even at high luminosity .",
    "while a minijet veto appears to be a promising technique , many questions need to be answered before its full potential as a trigger for weak boson scattering events can be confirmed .",
    "the main question is detector related : how low a @xmath9 threshold for the veto can be allowed without losing significantly on signal acceptance ?",
    "since background levels would be reduced dramatically if the veto threshold could be reduced to the 1015  gev range , the search strategy for a heavy higgs boson depends crucially on what can finally be achieved experimentally . on the theoretical side",
    "it is necessary to improve the predictions for the minijet activity in a region which is at the limits of a perturbative treatment .",
    "the task is to preserve the color coherence of multiple soft and/or collinear parton emission while keeping the information on the momentum scale where multiple emission becomes important .",
    "reliable calculations of these scales are essential to achieve a quantitative estimate of the background reduction factors due to a minijet veto . clearly , a leading logarithm calculation , with an undetermined comparison scale , is insufficient .",
    "the observation of these effects in very hard dijet events at the tevatron should provide an invaluable source of information  @xcite .",
    "it should demonstrate the existence of enhanced minijet activity in hard qcd events and give an estimate of the relevant momentum scales .",
    "since we are dealing with phenomena beyond the limits of fixed order perturbation theory , a fruitful interplay between experiment and theory appears to be the most promising way to turn minijet vetoing into a quantitative tool to search for a very heavy higgs boson or to make weak boson scattering visible at future hadron colliders .",
