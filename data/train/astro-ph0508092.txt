    "environmental processes have clearly played a significant role in shaping the morphological evolution of galaxies . @xcite first noted the increased fraction of actively - star forming galaxies in cluster cores at redshifts @xmath40.4 and subsequent studies clarified direct evolution in the relationship between morphological fractions and local density @xcite .",
    "recent work has extended these measures to galaxy samples in lower density environments and at higher redshifts @xcite , delineating a picture where the fraction of early - type ( hereafter elliptical and s0 ) galaxies to some rest - frame luminosity limit grows with time , and at a rate that seems to depend sensitively on the local density .",
    "what processes govern this apparent transformation of star - forming disk and irregular galaxies into the abundant elliptical and s0 population seen in present - day clusters ?",
    "galaxy clusters provide excellent laboratories to study these environmental effects , particularly at intermediate redshifts ( where the relevant processes were perhaps most active ) and over the full range of cluster radii , from the well - mixed cluster core to the outermost regions where field galaxies are falling into the cluster for the first time .",
    "this is the third paper in a series concerned with exploring the origin and evolution of the morphology - density relation via a detailed study of hundreds of galaxies to the turn around radius in the rich cluster cl  0024 + 1654 ( @xmath5=0.40 ) .",
    "the essential ingredients for this study include a large hubble space telescope wfpc-2 image mosaic providing galaxy morphologies , and keck spectroscopy , for membership , dynamics and diagnostics of recent star formation activity . in the first paper in the series , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we analyzed the relation between morphology , local density and cluster radius and pinpointed possible environmental processes which curtail star - formation within infalling galaxies .",
    "local density was shown to be a more reliable measure of the environmental trends than cluster radius , suggesting most infalling galaxies retain their original group properties until they reach the virial radius where such substructure is quickly erased .",
    "in the second paper @xcite , a physical model for the distribution of cluster mass and mass to light ratio was determined from strong and weak gravitational lensing .    in this third paper",
    ", we turn now to the spectroscopic diagnostics .",
    "spectroscopy of cluster members at various stages of infall can provide a key to the dominant environmental processes .",
    "as introduced in paper i , different physical mechanisms will produce recognizable spectral and dynamical signatures in the affected galaxies .",
    "while several independent processes can operate simultaneously in the central 0.51 mpc , these can be separated by contrasting differences over a wider dynamic range in radius and local density .",
    "since our first paper was submitted , we have continued to observe cl  0024 + 1654 ( hereafter cl  0024 ) at the keck observatory and our goal here is twofold : first , we update and finalize the redshift catalog of cluster members . using the deimos spectrograph on _ keck ii _ , we have now obtained spectra for nearly 1000 galaxies to a projected distance of 5  mpc ; the tally of cluster members is nearly 500 galaxies , the largest such sample at intermediate redshift .",
    "secondly , in addition to measuring redshifts in abundance we have exposed on a brighter subset of known members to a limit where our morphological classifications are particularly reliable . at this limit",
    ", our high - quality deimos spectra can be used to examine precise trends observed in various diagnostics of recent star formation as well as resolved dynamics of disk and early - type members .",
    "our goal is to analyze these trends according to both the timescale and physical location over which they occur in order to develop an overall picture of the processes that affect the cluster galaxy population .",
    "much of course has been learned from detailed spectroscopy of galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". however , previous studies of this type have either focused on the cluster core , where morphologies are available or relied on spectral types or colors to trace the effects of environment out to the cluster periphery @xcite . with a larger sample of morphologies and high quality spectra over the full range of local densities in cl  0024",
    ", we aim to provide a more complete picture of the environmental processes involved and their range of application .",
    "we focus here on cluster members classified as early - type ( e+s0 ) in our morphological catalog ( paper i ) . in the local universe ,",
    "cluster early - type galaxies are an extremely homogeneous population in terms of their stellar populations and structural properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of the morphology density relation indicates that a substantial fraction was accreted or transformed at intermediate redshift .",
    "several of the proposed environmental mechanisms are thought to have transformed spirals into s0s @xcite .    by studying these galaxies at intermediate redshifts and contrasting their spectral properties with those of their counterparts in the field and local universe we expect to be sensitive to signatures of past and current environmental activity . in this sense",
    ", we will explore early - type galaxies as `` test particles '' of recent activity .",
    "building on the conclusions herein , a future paper will address the properties of spiral galaxies in cl  0024 and discuss the galaxy population as a whole , taking into account morphological evolution ( see , e.g. , the discussion of _ progenitor bias _ in van dokkum & franx 2001 ) .",
    "the signal / noise of our early - type spectra was designed to be adequate to measure reliable stellar velocity dispersions for each galaxy , enabling us to construct the fundamental plane and , in particular , its possible variation with location .",
    "this emerges as a powerful probe of variations in the @xmath3 ratios and hence the luminosity - weighted ages of the stellar populations .",
    "precise measures of various line diagnostics permit us to independently probe the star formation histories over well - understood timescales . in combination ,",
    "both methods allow us to examine the relative importance of the environment and to constrain the physical mechanisms responsible .",
    "a key issue is the relationship between trends found in cl  0024 at various radii and those found in the field at approximately the same cosmic epoch .",
    "to facilitate such a comparison we make use of the recent comprehensive study of 163 field e+s0s undertaken by @xcite in the northern goods field .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "in   2 , we summarize the new spectroscopic observations and their data reduction , and present the final catalog of spectroscopic redshifts . in   3",
    "we discuss our measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions , the fits to the surface photometry , the various spectral line indices , as well as an improved estimate of the local environmental densities . in   4",
    "we present our results focusing first on the fundamental plane and the implications of the scatter and various trends seen as a function of luminosity and location , and correlations between the balmer absorption and metal line strengths with the velocity dispersion .",
    "we also analyze both radial trends and those seen in the residuals from our global cluster and field relations . in   5 , we develop an integrated picture which combines these independent methods and discuss this in the light of the conclusions we drew in paper i. for consistency , throughout this series of papers we use the cosmology adopted in paper i ( @xmath6 km s@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "high resolution imaging of cl  0024 is crucial for the type of spectroscopic study we wish to undertake , both for the purpose of selecting a sample of e+s0 galaxies , and to allow us to analyze the surface photometry of the selected galaxies .",
    "paper i presented the results of a wide - field _ hst _ imaging survey of cl  0024 .",
    "the survey includes a sparsely - sampled mosaic of 39 wfpc2 images taken in the f814w filter ( @xmath10 band ) , providing good coverage of the cluster field out to radius @xmath11 mpc ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "paper i reported morphological classifications down to @xmath13 .",
    "classifications to a limiting magnitude of @xmath14 were found to be very reliable , in that several authors , working independently , agreed upon the morphology for most objects .",
    "this included differentiation between the sub - types e , e / s0 , and s0 .",
    "while ellipticals and s0s were grouped together for the purposes of paper i , it is useful in this paper to detect any differences between the populations of es and s0s : if spirals are actively transforming into s0s at @xmath15 , we might expect to detect differences in the stellar populations of the two groups .    although face - on s0s are notoriously hard to distinguish from ellipticals , especially at high redshift where s0 disks may be too dim to detect @xcite , we can partially avoid this difficulty by focusing on the brightest early type galaxies where all but the faintest disks should be detectable . in this paper , therefore , we will report distinctions between e , e / s0 , and s0 galaxies for a brighter subset of this sample , to @xmath14 .",
    "we additionally employ a technique not discussed in paper i , namely that based on the residual signals found after subtraction of an axisymmetric de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath163.3 and 4.1.1 ) .      designed to both identify cluster members and acquire high signal to noise spectra of galaxies in cl  0024 , we began our spectroscopic campaign in october 2001 with lris on _ keck  i_. while some observations were completed that year ( see paper i ) , poor weather forced us to return in october 2002 and again in october 2003 , this time making use of the new deimos spectrograph on _ keck  ii _ @xcite .",
    "the survey was largely completed in 2003 , though a small number of additional galaxies were observed in december 2004 . in total",
    ", we have obtained new spectra of 955 objects , including 261 confirmed cluster members to @xmath13 .",
    "spectroscopic targets were selected from the cfht @xmath17band mosaic of the cl  0024 field @xcite . in designing slit masks ,",

    "galaxies without _ hst _ images filled the remainder of each slit mask , with priority given to known members .",
    "all targeted galaxies were brighter than @xmath13 .",
    "masks were designed so as to provide good coverage across the cl  0024 field , while also maximizing the number of known - member spiral galaxies that could be observed with tilted slits ( for extracting rotation curves from extended line emission ; to be discussed in a later paper . )     a typical spectrum for a galaxy near the magnitude limit of our brighter sample .",

    "we observed a total of 12 deimos slit masks in 2002 and 2003 , covering the entire field of the hst mosaic .",
    "we employed the 900 line / mm grating , with a central wavelength of 6200@xmath20 .",
    "this setup provides spectral coverage from 4500 to 8000 @xmath20 , with a pixel scale of approximately @xmath21 0.44 @xmath20 .",
    "slitlets were milled to be @xmath22 wide , providing spectral resolution of @xmath23 km  s@xmath19 . for most masks ,",
    "the exposure time was 2.5  hrs ( 5 @xmath24 1800s ) , though four masks were only observed for 2  hrs ( 4 @xmath24 1800s ) . in december 2004 , we observed a single additional mask for 3  hrs , 10 min , ( 5 @xmath24 1200s plus 3 @xmath24 1800s ) with the 600 line / mm grating , providing resolution of @xmath25 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "the central wavelength was again 6200@xmath20 , providing similar spectral coverage . in 2002 , conditions were fairly poor , with thin clouds frequently interrupting observations .",
    "seeing was approximately @xmath26 . in 2003 ,",
    "seeing was good ( 0506 ) , though conditions were not photometric . and in 2004",
    ", conditions were generally good , with seeing varying between 0711 across three nights .",
    "we analyze data for 104 e+s0 galaxies , of which 71 have particularly high quality spectra ( generally defined in this paper to be those for which reliable stellar velocity dispersions were measured ) .",
    "twelve of these e+s0s ( 6 high quality ) come from the lris observations discussed in paper i , with the remainder from deimos . broken down by specific morphological type ,",
    "our sample includes 34 galaxies classified as e , 50 as s0 , and 20 as e / s0 . of the galaxies with high quality spectra available , 27 are e , 38 s0 , and 10 e / s0 .",
    "we designed our spectroscopic campaign to yield high quality spectra for galaxies brighter than @xmath14 , in order to match the magnitude limit of paper i for precise morphological classification . as expected , all objects where we have obtained high quality spectra are brighter than this limit .",
    "we therefore divide our e+s0 galaxies into a sample that is brighter than @xmath14 and one that includes all observed e+s0 members down to @xmath13 . for the larger sample , signal / noise is generally sufficient to measure and examine trends in spectral line strengths .",
    "an @xmath27 galaxy in cl  0024 corresponds to @xmath28 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) , such that our two samples represent galaxies brighter than @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",

    "we construct fake galaxy spectra from stellar templates smoothed to the resolution and pixel scale of deimos ( for the 900 line / mm grating ) , truncated to an identical length of @xmath70 , convolved with a gaussian of various widths to simulate different velocity dispersions , and degraded to a variety of signal to noise ratios .",

    ", whatever mechanism affects the mass to light ratios of early - types in the cluster core is not apparent in any other measurements .",
    "although the observed scatter seems at variance with the notion that massive cluster ellipticals are uniformly old and quiescent , if we use the @xcite ssp models to predict the passive evolution of these galaxies to @xmath1 , the resulting scatter will match that observed locally .",
    "furthermore , the scatter in the field fp reported by @xcite in this redshift range is larger than in the core of cl  0024 , as expected if the range in ages and star formation histories is greater in the field than in the cluster environment",
    ".    there may be two separate populations of e+s0s in the core , then : older galaxies that formed earliest and which have @xmath3 already similar to that of local e+s0s , and galaxies with a lower @xmath3 which have more recently fallen into the cluster core . while there is no obvious separation between these two groups in figure  [ fig : deltaml ]",
    ", we do notice a residual correlation between @xmath181 and @xmath41 , in the sense that the most massive , highest@xmath41 cluster galaxies also have the highest mass to light ratios , indicating the oldest stellar populations .",
    "this is not a surprising correlation , but it does confirm that the high @xmath3 galaxies are typically the oldest and largest found in the cluster .",

    "for example , if we limit our sample to the mass range @xmath187 , we observe a significant difference in @xmath3 between the cluster periphery and core : @xmath188 .",
    "using field galaxies from the @xcite sample within this same mass range ( and in the redshift range @xmath189 ) , we find an offset between the cl  0024 cluster core and the field equal to @xmath190 .",

    "the upper mass limit is chosen so that we include only galaxies that are well - represented across the entire cluster , excluding the high - mass galaxies found only in the core .",
    "it makes sense to search for morphological differences between the old and young e+s0s in the cluster core .",
    "the existence of the morphology  density relation in cl  0024 ( paper i ) leads us to consider whether the younger , low @xmath3 galaxies are preferentially s0s that have recently been created or transformed from spirals .",

    "this radial variation holds ( in the two brighter magnitude bins ) even if we exclude the cluster core , where the fraction of [ oii ] emitters may be affected by the process causing the strong [ oii ] emission at the virial radius .",
    "we see then that both the fraction of galaxies with measurable [ oii ] emission , and the average strength of that emission rises slightly with radius .",
    "this suggests an encounter with the cluster environment which serves to gradually suppress the already low levels of early - type star formation during infall .",
    "another possibility is a simple gradient in galaxy formation age : older early types near the cluster core may simply contain less residual gas available for star formation .",

    "we discuss the physical mechanisms at work and conclude that our study of early - type galaxies has revealed the action of at least two different environmental processes : starvation and/or galaxy harassment is quenching low - level star formation over a long timescale in early - types beyond the cluster core , while harassment and/or interactions with shocks in the outer parts of the icm are producing the sudden bursts of star formation observed in small e+s0s around the virial radius .          in the residuals from the fundamental plane , we have observed a gradient in the mean mass to light ratios of e+s0s , allowing us to observe the transition from the oldest , highest @xmath3 galaxies in the cluster core , to the galaxies in the cluster periphery with younger luminosity - weighted ages , nearly matching the values of @xmath114 seen in field e+s0s @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the fp residuals is unexpectedly high within the inner 1  mpc of the cluster , but the fp appears tighter outside of this radius .",
    "direct measurements of spectral line strengths ( figure  [ fig : ew ] ) and the fraction of [ oii]-emitting early - types ( figure  [ fig : oiifrac ] ) both reveal a mildly declining star formation rate within early - types , from the field toward the cluster core .",
    "this is interrupted by an interaction at the virial radius that causes enhanced [ oii ] emission in a population of small , dim early types , along with enhanced balmer absorption and depressed [ mgfe]@xmath118 absorption strength for a population of larger , typical cluster e+s0s .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gal_evol ] , we combine the previously shown radial trends in @xmath212 , @xmath221 , @xmath209(h@xmath222h@xmath50 ) , and ew([oii ] ) into a single plot . as in figure",
    "[ fig : balmer_sigma_diff ] , in the top three panels we indicate every galaxy exhibiting high balmer absorption with a red mark .",
    "likewise , all galaxies with significant [ oii ] emission in the bottom panel are plotted with open symbols in each panel . while the galaxies with unexpectedly low [ mgfe]@xmath118 correlate with the balmer - strong galaxies , as mentioned in   4 above , there is no similar correlation with @xmath212 .",
    "we see some balmer - strong galaxies at both low and high @xmath3 , which indicates that the star formation causing the enhanced balmer line strengths does not drive the variations in @xmath3 that we observe ; the bursts of star formation are perhaps too minor to affect the overall @xmath3 of the galaxy , at least to levels detectable in our data .",
    "briefly , we recap the characteristic timescales for changes in each of the quantities plotted .",
    "[ oii ] emission traces the instantaneous rate of star formation , so that the observed strong [ oii ] emitters mark the location of a  hot spot \" of current star formation at 1.7  mpc radius ( though we emphasize that these objects are not spatially clustered ) .",
    "enhanced balmer absorption will persist for about 1  gyr after a burst of star formation , and so there is a time lag of @xmath223  gyr between the termination of star formation in these galaxies and the time when we observe them .",
    "changes in @xmath3 should persist for a similar amount of time after a recent burst of star formation ( until the luminous a stars begin to disappear ) , though we expect that @xmath3 is less sensitive to low - level star formation because it depends more closely on the integrated stellar light of the galaxy , which changes by a smaller amount than the strong spectral lines .",
    "we have so far presented evidence for a seemingly abrupt encounter with the environment that triggers star formation in early - types at or near the virial radius , along with a moderate decline in star formation from the periphery to the core , and a trend in @xmath3 that suggests that the stellar populations of early types at larger radius are younger . in this section",
    "we present a simple infall model as a tool to compare the timescales and strengths of several of the observed features in the early - type population .",
    "specifically , we wish to examine the possibility that both the galaxies with strong [ oii ] emission and those with excess balmer absorption could be caused by a common physical process . and",
    "while we have shown in   5.1 that the fp residuals , @xmath224 , do not correlate with the balmer - strong galaxies , we will also use this simple infall model to constrain the level of variation in @xmath3 that could be induced by the environment .    in this idealized model ,",
    "we follow an early - type galaxy as it proceeds toward the cluster center evolving passively , until it reaches the virial radius where it undergoes a short burst of star formation ( adding 1% to the total stellar mass , 200myrs of duration ) . after the burst",
    ", the galaxy continues its infall evolving passively . for this model",
    "we use the prescription of paper i to convert from infall time to cluster projected radius : assuming that the galaxy is on its first infall toward the cluster , it begins with a small velocity at @xmath225  mpc and accelerates freely toward the cluster potential .    the observable properties of this model",
    "are then computed using stellar population synthesis models by @xcite to compare with observations .",
    "although this is clearly a simplified model  for example it neglects `` backsplash '' @xcite ,",
    "i.e. the fact that especially in the cluster center , and even out to two virial radii , some galaxies might not be on their first approach toward the cluster ( see discussion in paper i ) , and it is a closed boxed model , i.e. there is no provision for galaxies being transformed into e+s0s during the infall  we will show that this model reproduces the strengths and timescales of many of the observed features and provides useful guidance to interpret the observations .",
    "the predictions of the model are shown as a dashed line in figure  [ fig : gal_evol ] .",
    "specifically , we plot the difference in @xmath212 , @xmath221 , @xmath209(h@xmath222h@xmath50 ) , and star formation rate ( sfr ) between the infalling model galaxy and an identical model without the starburst .",
    "since we are interested only in the predicted change in line strengths due to a recent star formation event , the proper quantity to plot is this difference between the index strengths predicted by the passive model and the one with a small starburst overlayed .",
    "we emphasize that the model track for @xmath224 is meant to replicate only the change in @xmath3 caused by a small starburst , and does not account for the radial gradient in @xmath226 seen in the data .    to calibrate the star formation rates predicted by the models to the [ oii ] equivalent widths observed , we used sfrs derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and private communication ) from their deep h@xmath98 images , according to the procedure outlined in   3.4 .",
    "the choice of a 1% starburst produces a sfr and [ oii ] equivalent width equal to that observed in the largest / brightest of our low - luminosity [ oii ] emitting galaxies , which we estimate to have a stellar mass up to around @xmath227 m@xmath228 ( see   3.4 ) .",
    "the 200  myr timescale approximately matches the spread in cluster radius over which we see these [ oii ] emitters .",
    "the stellar mass associated with the starburst could vary with galaxy size and need not add up to 1% of the galaxy mass . for our [ oii ] emitters , the luminosities and equivalent widths",
    "imply that up to a 5@xmath229 burst could be involved , depending on its duration .",
    "however , 1% represents a good upper limit for the larger galaxies with enhanced balmer absorption , as we would otherwise expect to observe `` post - starburst '' k+a spectra ; the excess balmer absorption is not strong enough to place any in this category .    examining the track of the model in figure  [ fig : gal_evol ]",
    ", it is remarkable how well the expected change in balmer line strength matches the observations in both maximum strength and in the time it takes this enhanced absorption to decay away .",
    "this lends strength to our contention that the enhanced balmer absorption and the high [ oii ] emission are reflections of the same physical process .",
    "we also observe a dip in the strength of [ mgfe]@xmath118 just where we would expect it , though the magnitude of this dip does not seem great enough to account for the observed [ mgfe]@xmath118 decrement .",
    "this may simply be a deficiency in the @xcite models , as the observed values of [ mgfe]@xmath118 span a larger range than could be predicted by the models at any ssp age or metallicity .",
    "in contrast , the models easily account for the full range of observed balmer line strengths .",
    "therefore , changes in [ mgfe]@xmath118 due to a small starburst could be under predicted by the @xcite models .",
    "we note that the population of [ oii ] emitters observed can not evolve directly into the population of galaxies with strong balmer lines , though they could still be indicators of the same physical mechanism .",
    "the balmer - strong e+s0s are brighter and larger in effective radius , and any fading of the [ oii ] emitters would only increase the difference between these populations .",
    "since they are near our spectroscopic magnitude limit , we would not expect to observe faded remnants of the [ oii ] emitting galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of bright early types with strong [ oii ] emission might arise because the timescale for the balmer lines to decay ( 1  gyr ) exceeds the starburst timescale ( 200  myrs ) , so that we would not expect to observe more than one of the emission line progenitors of these balmer - strong galaxies .",
    "this is partly due to the overall smaller number of bright e+s0s observed within the transition region ( 12.4  mpc ) , in comparison to the @xmath39 observed in the cluster core .    to further examine our hypothesis that the [ oii]-emitting and balmer - strong galaxies are caused by the same environmental interaction during infall",
    ", we can examine the 2d spatial distribution of these galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : spatial_dist ] , we plot [ oii ] emitters in blue and early - types with strong balmer absorption in red , on top of the overall distribution of cluster members from the combined spectroscopic and photometric redshift catalogs .",
    "the [ oii ] emitters and balmer absorbers follow the overall distribution of cluster members closely , lying mostly along the major axis of the cluster ( stretching from the overdensity nw of the cluster core through to the se side of the core ) .",
    "though the [ oii ] galaxies perhaps extend in a larger arc at @xmath230  mpc , their small number makes it difficult to determine their azimuthal distribution .",
    "the distribution supports the idea that they have been perturbed during infall , as this is most likely occurring predominantly along the nw to se path .        turning to the top panel in figure  [ fig : gal_evol ]",
    ", it seems that the small starbursts at the virial radius can not alter the overall @xmath3 of early types by a large enough amount to account for the large scatter that we see in the cluster core .",
    "it seems that there must simply exist a mix of older , high @xmath3 galaxies and more recently arrived low @xmath3 galaxies in this region . on the other hand , the triggered star formation may help prolong the length of time that an infalling e+s0 remains at low @xmath3 after reaching the cluster core .",
    "this could possibly explain why the scatter in @xmath3 seen in this cluster is so much higher than that observed in cl  1358 + 62 at @xmath108 @xcite ; the mechanism causing this star formation in cl  0024 might not be active or significant in all clusters at this redshift .    while the simple model presented here does not attempt to account for the observed radial gradient in @xmath3",
    ", we note that the difference in @xmath231 between a galaxy at 5  mpc radius , of age 2.7  gyr , and that same galaxy 5  gyr later ( corresponding to the total free - fall time to the cluster center ) , is equal to -0.35 .",
    "this is nearly identical to the observed difference in @xmath231 between the mean value in the periphery , and the @xmath3 of the oldest galaxies in the core . while the galaxies in the periphery are almost certainly not this young , the observed gradient in @xmath3 seems consistent with a difference in formation age ( or in time since the last major burst , c.f .",
    "bower et al .",
    "1998 and treu et al .",
    "2005b ) of a few gyrs between cluster periphery and core .",
    "a gradient in formation age , then , is a viable explanation for the @xmath3 gradient we observe , though the gradual decline in star formation that we observe could also be important in generating the @xmath3 gradient .",
    "having suggested that the observed spectral features of our early - type sample are due to a small starburst , it is natural to ask if such a burst is realistic ; in other words , do e+s0s at redshift @xmath232 contain enough residual gas to undergo such episodes of star formation ? according to @xcite , the fraction of molecular gas detected in local `` normal '' early type galaxies ( i.e. showing no signs of current or recent interaction or dwarf cannibalism , but otherwise selected across all local environments ) , can approach 1% of the total stellar mass ( with typical values ranging from 0.050.5% ) . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "some field e+s0s have peculiar color gradients that may indicate recent star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "allowing for the possibility of faint , undetected interaction features in our much more distant sample , as well as the expected decrease in the remnant molecular gas in ellipticals since @xmath123 , we expect that a small burst of star formation of up to 1% is entirely plausible for early - type galaxies in cl  0024 .",
    "additional evidence comes from the observation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the combinations of spectral line strengths observed in early - type galaxies are best explained if most early - types have undergone secondary episodes of star formation at some point in their past ; the balmer - strong galaxies observed here could possibly have undergone such secondary bursts in the last 1  gyr .",
    "the early - type galaxies in cl  0024 have proven to be effective signposts for identifying two possible forms of environmental evolution in this cluster , but can we identify the physical processes responsible ? we observe a slow decline in remnant star formation from the field / periphery to the core which may indicate a physical mechanism at work which slowly quenches star formation . seemingly overlaid on top of this mild trend is a nearly - instantaneous interaction that triggers a small burst of star formation in many of these early - type galaxies at the virial radius .",
    "first , we address physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the gradual decline in star formation rate toward the cluster core , best illustrated in figure  [ fig : oiifrac ] . in analyzing the cause of the observed decline , we must also consider the morphology  density ( t@xmath233 ) relation observed in cl  0024 . in paper",
    "i , it was argued that the existence of the t@xmath233 relation across several orders of magnitude in projected local density indicates that whatever process causes the morphological segregation of galaxies by environment , it acts slowly .",
    "the slow `` starvation''(see paper i ) of galaxies during infall is consistent with the existence of the t@xmath233 relation , as is the action of galaxy harassment @xcite .",
    "starvation encompasses several physical mechanisms that all serve to slowly deprive a galaxy of cold gas available for star formation .",
    "for example , thermal evaporation of the galaxy interstellar medium ( ism ) by interaction with the hot cluster icm @xcite , or turbulent and viscous stripping of the ism @xcite are two possible causes of starvation .",
    "either of these processes could be acting in cl  0024 , and are consistent with both the observed gradient in star formation rate and the existence of the t@xmath233 relation .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that the truncation of star formation in cluster galaxies must be rapid , based on their observation that the h@xmath98 luminosity function does not vary with environment .",
    "both our paper and theirs find a similar decline in the _ fraction _ of star forming galaxies , but they do not observe a decline in the mean strength of emission",
    ". the discrepancy may be due to the different levels of star formation probed : the low levels of remnant star formation in the early - type population discussed here may be quenched slowly , while a separate physical process ( such as harassment ) could rapidly decrease the moderate star formation observed by @xcite , which occurs mostly in the spiral population .",
    "combined with a longer timescale for morphological transformation , this could lead to the `` passive spirals '' they discuss .",
    "paper i also argued that the existence of the t@xmath233 relation means that the morphological mix is set by the pre - cluster environment : the overall formation history within assembling groups is the dominant factor in determining the morphological mix seen in the cluster .",
    "this view is consistent with the trend we observe in the @xmath3 ratios of cluster early - types .",
    "we find that the differences in @xmath3 must arise partially out of variations in the mass  assembly history of early - type galaxies , though the radial trend in @xmath234 may also reflect the quenching of remnant star formation during infall .",
    "interrupting the slow decline in star formation are the small bursts of star formation we observe . rapidly acting mechanisms that could trigger such a burst include galaxy harassment or some encounter with the icm . as noted in   4 ,",
    "major mergers are ruled out because the galaxies seem to be in low density regions , and all but one of the galaxies involved show no visual evidence for such a disturbance .",
    "galaxy harassment becomes important near the virial radius as both galaxy crowding and the typical velocity of an interaction become high enough .",
    "( see paper i. ) further , it is a rapid interaction , and the galaxy that triggers one of our observed starbursts can quickly move away from the vicinity of the starburst galaxy .",
    "@xcite present simulations of the harassment of small sc / sd spiral galaxies as they fall into the cluster .",
    "such galaxies can be quickly transformed into objects that appear to have an early - type morphology .",
    "these harassment remnants are small objects ( @xmath235kpc ) , similar to our observed [ oii ] emitters , and could represent the origin of the large population of dwarf spheroidals observed in clusters today . in addition , @xcite predict that harassment would drive the gas within a spiral toward the galaxy s center , thus providing a natural mechanism for fueling the starbursts ( or agn ) we observe .",
    "if these are the remnants of harassed spirals , they may not be on their first infall into the cluster ; the timescale for passage from the cluster core back out to the virial radius may be short enough ( @xmath236  gyr ) that star formation induced by interactions with large ellipticals in the cluster center could still be visible . a possible explanation , then , for finding them preferentially at the virial radius could be that this is near the apse of their orbit within the cluster .    under the harassment scenario , we speculate that the population of balmer - strong galaxies could represent the large cluster ellipticals which cause the harassment , perhaps cannibalizing young stars from smaller harassed galaxies .",
    "alternatively , they could be undergoing harassment themselves , albeit with a much smaller gas reservoir and a correspondingly smaller episode of star formation .",
    "ram - pressure stripping or triggering of star formation has been thought to be effective only much closer to the cluster core , and should not be significant near the virial radius where the environmental interaction is taking place .",
    "however , recent work on large - scale shocks and particularly the virial shock  the shock boundary between the hot , dense icm and the colder , diffuse infalling gas from outside the cluster",
    " suggests that a galaxy passing through this shock boundary could be given enough of an impulse to trigger stripping of hi gas and the collapse of any molecular clouds @xcite . particularly relevant to cl  0024 is the work by @xcite .",
    "they showed that a merger between two clusters or sub - cluster clumps can cause powerful shocks to propagate through the icm .",
    "as the redshift distribution of galaxies in cl  0024 is double - peaked @xcite , indicating a large infalling group or sub - cluster , such strong shocks could be responsible for the triggered starbursts we observe .",
    "if this is the case , we would not expect to see such bursts in other clusters with more regular structure .",
    "our sample of 104 e+s0s contains only four galaxies from the smaller peak b of the redshift distribution in cl  0024 ( figure  [ fig : redshifts ] ) , so we are unable to more carefully explore possible differences between early type galaxies in these two peaks .",
    "but in the local universe , @xcite finds a population of star forming dwarf galaxies that lie along contours in the x - ray substructure of the coma cluster .",
    "it is possible that the [ oii ] emitters in cl  0024 lie along similar boundaries in the cluster substructure , but the nearly face - on orientation of the merger between peak a and peak b makes testing this hypothesis difficult . in this scenario",
    ", the existence of balmer - strong galaxies interior to the virial radius would imply that some sort of boundary shock between peak a and peak b has persisted for at least @xmath64  gyr , the timescale for the excess balmer absorption to decay away .",
    "our small population of strong [ oii ] emitters is a signpost to an important physical interaction , and is not a peculiarity unique to this cluster . a similar population of dim , compact , e+s0s with [ oii ] emission has also been reported by @xcite , for a galaxy cluster at @xmath237 . while the cluster they study is not virialized , the [ oii ] emitters they observe seem to reside in a region outside of the contours of the cluster x - ray emission . and",
    "work by @xcite examining the radial distribution of x - ray point sources in the macs sample of clusters has uncovered a prominent spike in the number of cluster agn detected in the area around the virial radius ( @xmath238  mpc in the clusters studied ) .",
    "these agn may be stimulated by the cluster environment via the same physical mechanism causing the [ oii]-strong early - types .",
    "therefore , even though they only represent a small fraction of the total mass and star - formation in clusters , these galaxies warrant further study of their role as indicators of environmental interaction .",
    "while the exact physical mechanisms responsible for the environmental evolution are still not known , further work on this cluster , and a similar planned study of the x - ray bright cluster ms  0451 - 03 at @xmath239 may allow us to determine which processes are dominant .",
    "analyzing the star formation rates and rotation curves of spirals in cl  0024 may help us trace the gradual decline in star formation rate hinted at here , as star formation in spirals is in general much more vigorous than in the early types studied so far .",
    "other authors have found similar declines in the star formation rate in spiral populations of clusters at intermediate redshift @xcite .",
    "rotation curves have also been used to study variations in the kinematics and mass to light ratios of spirals , in distant clusters by , e.g. , @xcite , and in cl  0024 by @xcite .",
    "likewise , the x - ray luminosity of ms  0451 is much higher than that of cl  0024 .",
    "if shocks in the icm really do cause the bursts of star formation observed in early types near the virial radius , then we should see a similar or even stronger effect in ms  0451 , but at a higher radius .",
    "if the strength of the icm shocks in cl  0024 is enhanced by the sub - cluster merger , however , we might expect to see no starbursting early types at all in ms  0451 .",
    "the importance of galaxy harassment should be nearly the same between the two clusters , so we would expect to see similarly strong starbursts in ms  0451 if the cl  0024 bursts are due to harassment .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of an extensive spectroscopic survey of the cluster cl  0024 + 1654 , undertaken with deimos on _ keck ii _ and lris on _ keck i_. we examine the detailed spectral and photometric properties of cluster early types across an area 10 mpc in diameter .",
    "the principal goal of this wide area survey is to examine variations in galaxy properties with local environment , in order to identify the physical processes that may affect the star formation properties or morphological characteristics of infalling galaxies . in this paper , we have used the early - type galaxy population as sensitive indicators of interaction with the cluster environment .",
    "our main observational results are : + 1 ) combining our new redshift survey of nearly 1000 galaxies with previous work on this cluster , we present a comprehensive redshift catalog for cl  0024 , consisting of 1394 unique objects with redshifts , of which 486 are cluster members . from our survey",

    "while the mean change in @xmath3 is in line with that expected by passive evolution of an old stellar population , the high scatter of @xmath150 in @xmath3 suggests a more complex assembly history for this cluster .",

    "galaxies seem to be younger at higher radius , with e+s0s in the cluster periphery ( @xmath244 ) nearly matching the values of @xmath3 seen in the field at this redshift @xcite .",
    "we therefore have bridged the gap between the observed properties of cluster and field early types at intermediate redshift .",
    "similar trends are seen as a function of local density .",
    "some fraction of this radial gradient could be caused by the  downsizing \" effect described by , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "the radial distribution of enhanced - balmer e+s0s is consistent with the expected infall timescale of such galaxies .",
    "galaxy mergers are not the source of this enhanced activity ; the [ oii ] emitters reside in relatively low density regions , and do not appear to reside in groups .",

    "this seems to confirm evidence for downsizing seen by @xcite , and indicates that galaxy mass is a primary indicator of star formation activity , even as environmental effects work on top of this to produce radial variations in star formation .",
    "both of these ultimately serve to decrease star formation toward the highest density regions , though the precise link to morphological transformation is still unclear because of the different timescales involved .",
    "+ we have uncovered environmental processes working on cluster early types , but we have also seen variations in galaxy properties across the cluster that indicate that both galaxy mass and environment of initial formation are important in determining the overall assembly history of early type galaxies .    by obtaining high quality spectra of cluster members across a large area around cl  0024 , and combining with a panoramic _ hst _ mosaic , we have been able to uncover physical mechanisms at work that never would have been seen if we only looked at the cluster core .",

    "<S> , we detect a significantly increased scatter in the relationship compared to that seen in local clusters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observe a clear radial trend in the mass to light ratios of individual early types , with the oldest galaxies located in the cluster core . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies are apparently younger at larger radius , with e+s0s in the periphery having @xmath3 ratios that nearly match values seen in the field at a similar redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the strong radial trend is seen even when the sample is restricted to a narrow range in galaxy mass . </S>",
    "<S> independent spectral indicators used in combination reveal an abrupt interaction with the cluster environment which occurs near the virial radius of cl  0024 , revealed by small bursts of star formation in a population of dim early - types , as well as by enhanced balmer absorption for a set of larger e+s0s closer to the cluster core . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a simple infall model used to compare the timescales and strengths of the observed interactions in this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the possibility that bursts of star formation are triggered when galaxies suffer shocks as they encounter the intra - cluster medium , or by the onset of galaxy harassment . </S>"
