    "nlo corrections require as ingredients both real - radiative corrections and virtual corrections to basic amplitudes .",
    "the structure of the real - radiative corrections  isolation of infrared singularities and their systematic cancellation against virtual - correction singularities  is well understood , and there are general methods for organizing them  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the most popular of these methods , the catani - seymour dipole subtraction method  @xcite , has now been implemented in an automatic fashion  @xcite .",
    "the infrared divergences of virtual corrections , needed to cancel the divergences from integrating real radiation over phase space , are also understood in general  @xcite .",
    "the main bottleneck to nlo computations of processes with four or more final - state objects has been the evaluation of the remaining ingredients , the infrared - finite parts of the one - loop virtual corrections .    as the number of external particles increases , the computational difficulty of loop - amplitude calculations using traditional feynman diagrams grows rapidly .",
    "technologies that have proven useful at tree level , such as the spinor - helicity formalism  @xcite , do not suffice to tame these difficulties . in the past few years",
    ", several classes of new methods have been proposed to cope with this rapid growth  @xcite , including on - shell methods  @xcite which are based on the analytic properties of unitarity and factorization that any amplitude must satisfy  @xcite .",
    "these methods are efficient , and display very mild growth in required computer time with increasing number of external particles , compared to a traditional feynman - diagrammatic approach .",

    "other researchers are constructing numerical programs  @xcite based on related methods  @xcite .    on - shell methods rely on the unitarity of the theory  @xcite and on its factorization properties , which together require that the poles and branch cuts of amplitudes correspond to the physical propagation of particles .",
    "in general , any one - loop amplitude computed in a quantum field theory contains terms with branch cuts , and also purely rational terms , that is , terms that have no branch cuts and are rational functions of the external momentum invariants ( or more precisely of spinor products ) .",

    "britto , cachazo and feng ( bcf ) observed  @xcite that with _ complex _",
    "momenta one can use quadruple cuts to solve for _ all _ box coefficients , because massless three - point amplitudes isolated by cuts do not vanish as they would for real massless momenta . moreover , the solution is purely algebraic , because the loop momentum of the four - dimensional integral is completely frozen by the four cut conditions , and a given quadruple cut isolates a unique box coefficient .",
    "this provides an extremely simple method for computing box - integral coefficients . continuing along these lines , britto , buchbinder , cachazo , feng , and mastrolia",

    "they use spinor variables and compute integral coefficients via residue extraction .    for the purposes of constructing a numerical code , we use a somewhat different approach . for triangle integrals",
    ", we can impose at most three cut conditions .",
    "this leaves a one - parameter family of solutions .",
    "these conditions no longer isolate the triangle integral uniquely , as a number of box integrals will share the same triple cut .",
    "similar considerations apply to the ordinary two - particle cuts needed to obtain bubble coefficients . as discussed by ossola , papadopoulos and pittau ( opp )  @xcite",
    ", one can construct a general parametric form for the integrand .",
    "this form can be understood as a decomposition of the loop momentum in terms of components in the hyperplane of external momenta and components perpendicular to this hyperplane  @xcite .",
    "coefficients of the various master integrals can be extracted by comparing the expressions obtained from feynman graphs with the general parametric form , using values of the loop momentum in which different combinations of propagators go on shell . for the quadruple cut",

    "opp solve the problems of box contributions to triangle coefficients , and of box and triangle contributions to bubble coefficients , iteratively by subtracting off previously - determined contributions and solving a particular system of equations numerically . in the opp approach ,",
    "the rational terms can be determined by keeping the full @xmath8-dimensional dependence in all terms  @xcite .",

    "the proof relies only on the factorization properties of the theory and on cauchy s theorem , so the method can be applied to a wide variety of theories . at loop level",
    ", the construction of an analogous recursion relation for the rational terms requires addressing a number of subtleties , including the presence of spurious singularities .",
    "these issues can and have been addressed for specific infinite series of one - loop helicity amplitudes , allowing their recursive construction  @xcite . in order to more easily automate the method of ref .",

    ", the finite precision of a computation means that instabilities can arise , occasionally leading to substantial errors in evaluating an amplitude at a given point in phase space .",
    "we introduce simple tests for the stability of the evaluation .",
    "principally , we check that the sum of bubble integral coefficients agrees with its known value , and we check for the absence of spurious singularities in this sum .",
    "a comparison with known analytic answers for a variety of gluon amplitudes shows that these two tests suffice to detect almost all instabilities .",
    "if a test fails , we consider the point to be unstable .",
    "various means of dealing with unstable points have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "we simply re - evaluate the fairly small fraction of unstable points at higher precision using the qd package  @xcite .",
    "doing so , we still have an average evaluation time of less than 120 ms for the most complicated of the six - gluon helicity amplitudes , and subtantially better times for the simpler ones .",

    "there are other possible means for dealing with gram - determinant singularities  @xcite , but we prefer this approach because of its simplicity  @xcite . in practice , it has a relatively modest impact on the overall speed of the program . in the most complicated of the six - gluon helicity amplitudes ,",
    "higher - precision evaluation causes the time to increase modestly , from 72 ms to 114 ms .",
    "we expect to see further improvements with additional refinements .",
    "it is important to validate a numerical method against known analytic results .",
    "for this purpose , we made use of mhv configurations , which contain two gluons of helicity opposite to that of the others .",
    "in particular , we considered the case where the two opposite helicities are nearest neighbors in the color order . in earlier work ,",
    "these amplitudes were computed for an arbitrary number of external gluons  @xcite , using on - shell methods .",
    "we used these results to confirm that returns the correct values through eight gluons .",
    "we also verified numerical stability for non - mhv amplitudes by comparing results for all six - gluon amplitudes against a reference computation done entirely using quadruple - precision arithmetic .",
    "we defer discussion of amplitudes with external fermions , or with massive quarks and vector bosons , to the future .",
    "( some work directly relevant to the question of adding massive particles may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) we will also present further details , including the integral expansions we use around spurious singularities , in a future publication  @xcite .",
    "the excellent numerical stability and timing performance of is due to a variety of ideas described in this paper . because the unitarity method uses gauge - invariant tree amplitudes as the basic input into the calculation , we avoid the large gauge cancellations inherent in feynman - diagram calculations .",
    "in addition we made use of very compact four - dimensional tree - level helicity amplitudes as the basic input to the calculations .",
    "all steps in our computation of the rational terms , as well as the integral coefficients , are carried out in four dimensions .",
    "our simple quadruple - cut solution ( [ masslesssolution ] ) also helps maintain numerical stability in the box contributions . our parametrization choices for triple and double cuts , and the opp subtraction of previously - computed coefficients are additional important ingredients .",
    "finally , our use of discrete fourier projections helps considerably .",
    "the resulting c++ code is efficient and numerically stable , as we have illustrated with the computation of various one - loop gluon amplitudes and their comparison to known analytic expressions .",
    "based on the results presented here , we expect to make possible the computation of a wide variety of new one - loop amplitudes for collider physics that have been inaccessible with traditional methods .",
    "we hope that , in conjunction with automated programs  @xcite for combining the real and virtual contributions at nlo , will soon enable the computation of phenomenologically important cross - sections at the lhc .",
