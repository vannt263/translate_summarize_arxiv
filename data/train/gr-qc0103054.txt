    "the generic response of a black hole to dynamical perturbations was first investigated more than thirty years ago .",
    "vishveshwara @xcite was the first to observe , in simple numerical experiments where a schwarzschild black hole was pelted by gaussian wave - pulses , the `` ringing '' associated with the exponentially damped quasinormal modes ( qnms ) .",
    "shortly thereafter , the late time power - law fall - off ( that all perturbative fields decay as @xmath2 in the schwarzschild geometry ) was discovered by price @xcite . since these first studies ,",
    "a considerable body of work has established the importance of these two phenomena for black hole physics ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we now know that the late - time tail is due to radiation backscattered by the weak gravitational potential in the far - zone@xcite .",
    "it is independent of the central object s strong - field features ( such as the presence of an event horizon ) , and will consequently be the same for ( say ) a neutron star and a black hole with the same gravitational mass .",
    "in contrast , the qnms represent radiation scattered in the strong - field regime .",
    "hence , they provide the means for making a clear distinction between a neutron star and a black hole .",
    "a neutron star has many families of fluid pulsations modes , an observation of which would provide useful constraints on the supranuclear equation of state @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a set of modes that arise because gravitational waves can be temporarily trapped by the spacetime curvature caused by the presence of the star .",
    "these modes share some qualitative features with the qnms of a black hole , which arise as waves are temporarily trapped in the vicinity of the black hole s gravitational potential peak ( located near the unstable photon orbit at @xmath3 in the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "the modes are analogous to scattering resonances in quantum physics and thus decay exponentially in time . in a detailed study ,",
    "leaver @xcite identified the qnms as complex - frequency poles of the relevant green s function ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , he showed that the power - law tail , that dominates the black holes dynamical response once the qnms have died away , originates from the presence of a branch cut in the green s function ( customarily placed along the negative imaginary frequency axis ) .",
    "most previous studies of qnms and power - law tails have focused on non - rotating black holes , and our understanding of this case has reached a mature level . the same can not be said about the rotating case , however .",
    "a few years ago , the qnms had been calculated also for kerr black holes @xcite , but there were no actual calculations demonstrating the presence of power - law tails .",
    "several recent developments have improved our understanding of dynamical rotating black holes .",
    "of particular relevance has been an effort to develop a reliable framework for perturbative time - evolutions of kerr black holes @xcite",
    ". there has also been recent efforts to analytically approximate the late - time power - law tails for kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of these studies support the standard picture : the qnm signal ( typically dominated by the slowest damped mode ) gives way at late times to a power - law fall - off .",
    "although the qnm frequencies and the late - time power - law are slightly altered by rotation , the results are qualitatively similar to the schwarzschild ones . for example , for a massless scalar field ori and barack  @xcite predict a fall - off ( for non - extreme kerr black holes ) proportional to @xmath4 where @xmath5 for even / odd @xmath6 .",
    "this should be compared to the schwarzschild result @xmath2 .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the rotation - induced coupling of the various @xmath7-multipoles in the signal .      with a new generation of gravitational - wave detectors due to reach their projected sensitivities within the next few years , the question whether we can realistically hope to do `` black - hole spectroscopy '' by detecting qnm signals following ( say ) the formation of a black hole in a supernova is of obvious interest . in principle",
    ", such a detection should enable us to infer the black - hole mass and angular momemtum and therefore provide an unambiguous identification of astrophysical black holes .    for slowly rotating black holes",
    "this presents a serious challenge . to demonstrate this in a simple way we consider the gravitational wave signal associated with a certain qnm",
    "far away from the black hole the associated flux follows from the standard formula @xmath8 using this together with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the e - folding time of the qnm , and assuming a monochromatic wave ( of frequency @xmath11 ) such that @xmath12 ( although we note that this assumption is not justified for rapidly damped qnms ) , we get @xmath13 finally , we estimate the effective amplitude achievable after matched filtering as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of detected cycles of the signal . parameterising this result we arrive at ( cf .",
    "similar estimates for pulsating stars @xcite ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radiated energy as a fraction of the black hole s mass @xmath18 . for a schwarzschild black hole",
    "the frequency of the radiation depends on the black - hole mass as @xmath19 .",
    "given these relations , and recalling the estimated sensitivity of the generation of ground based detectors that is under construction ( ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama ) , we see that it is going to be difficult to see qnm signals from slowly rotating solar - mass black holes .",
    "the mode - signals are basically too rapidly damped .",
    "but there are reasons not to despair .",
    "first of all , the situation is much more favourable for low - frequency signals from supramassive black holes in galactic nuclei and detection with lisa , the space - based interferometric gravitational - wave antenna .",
    "secondly , there have been recent indications that `` middle weight '' black holes , with masses in the range @xmath20 , exist @xcite . for such black holes the most important qnms would radiate at frequencies where the new generation of ground based detectors reach their peak sensitivity ( @xmath21  hz ) .",
    "if there are such black holes in our galaxy , and they are dynamically perturbed by some external agent , we may hope to detect the resultant qnm ringing in the future .",
    "it has been suggested that qnm signals from rapidly rotating black holes would be easier to detect than what the above estimate suggests .",
    "this belief is based on the fact that some qnms become very long lived as @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the rotation parameter of the black hole ) .",
    "qnm calculations predict the existence of an infinite set of essentially undamped modes in the extreme kerr limit @xcite , and previous investigations into the detectability of qnm signals have focused on the slow damping of these modes @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see how the decreased damping of the modes may increase the detectability considerably .",
    "but it is also easy to understand that a slowly damped mode is only easier to detect than a short - lived one if the modes are excited to a comparable amplitude .",
    "this then forces us to address ( rather difficult ) issues regarding qnm excitation @xcite .",
    "in particular , we must investigate whether it is easier to excite a slowly damped qnm than a short - lived one .",
    "intuitively , one might expect this not to be the case . in similar physical situations",
    "the build - up of energy in a long - lived resonant mode takes place on a time - scale similar to the eventual mode damping .",
    "consequently , it ought to be quite difficult to excite a qnm that has characteristic damping several times longer than the dynamical timescale of the excitation process .",
    "this argument suggests that the amplitude of each long - lived mode ought to vanish in the limit @xmath22 when the e - folding time of the mode increases dramatically .",
    "indications that this is the case were provided by ferrari and mashhoon some years ago @xcite .    to illustrate this further ,",
    "we connect ( [ heff1 ] ) to the amplitude of the qnm under consideration .",
    "we do this by assuming that the mode - signal can be represented by @xmath24 then we can use ( [ flux ] ) to infer the `` amplitude '' @xmath25 that corresponds to a certain `` total energy radiated through the mode '' @xmath26 .",
    "we get @xmath27 and the effective gravitational - wave amplitude @xmath28 here we have used an empirical approximation for the frequency and damping rate of the fundamental @xmath29 mode @xcite . when the effective amplitude is expressed in this form it is quite clear that a decrease in @xmath25 can easily compensate for the increase in @xmath10 that occurs as the black hole spins up . in other words ,",
    "in order to correctly discuss the detectability of the kerr qnms one must necessarily investigate this balance .",
    "this provides the prime motivation for the present work .      in a previous paper @xcite we discussed some issues concerning the long - lived qnms of a kerr black hole .",
    "our results essentially followed by studying a suitably defined excitation coefficient ( defined in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the perturbed field , see section  iie of the present paper ) , @xmath30 .",
    "provided that one can calculate this quantity ( which is far from trivial @xcite ) for a given qnm as the black hole spin varies one can estimate the associated change in level of excitation of the mode .",
    "this follows since we can express the effective amplitude ( [ heff ] ) associated with a single qnm ( with complex frequency @xmath31 ) as @xmath32    using results derived in the main part of this paper we find , for an extreme kerr black hole , that @xmath33 where @xmath17 is a positive real constant ( see section iid for its definition ) , and the least damped modes correspond to large values of the integer @xmath34 . from this",
    "we immediately deduce that the `` effective detectability '' is exponentially small for these modes .",
    "similar evidence is provided by recently obtained numerical data @xcite relevant for the full range of @xmath35 .",
    "before we discuss these results we recall that the qnms of a non - rotating black hole are located symmetrically with respect to the imaginary frequency axis in the complex @xmath36-plane . for non - zero @xmath35 this symmetry is broken and co- and counter - rotating modes will be affected in different ways .",
    "the counter - rotating modes remain rapidly damped , while the co - rotating modes become very slowly damped as @xmath22 .",
    "these conclusions follow from eg .",
    "figure  3 in @xcite .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we compare the `` effective gravitational - wave amplitude '' obtained from ( [ heff2 ] ) for the slowest damped co- and counter - rotating qnms of a kerr black hole perturbed by a massless scalar field . from the figure we see that , even though the co - rotating mode is much longer lived , its `` detectability '' decreases significantly as @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , our results suggest that the effective amplitude of the slowest damped qnm for a rapidly rotating black hole may be as much as three orders of magnitude smaller than the amplitude of the corresponding mode of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this is clearly very bad news as far as detecting the various qnms of a rapidly spinning black hole is concerned .",
    "however , one further complication must be accounted for .",
    "our argument shows that each individual qnm has a small amplitude in the limit of a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "but we need to account for the fact that a large number of modes approach the same limiting frequency as @xmath22 .",
    "conceivably , these modes could interfere constructively and result in a considerable signal .",
    "indeed , our previous estimates @xcite suggest that , despite the fact that the individual long - lived modes are excited to a negligible level their collective contribution to the late - time signal is significant .",
    "this then leads to a late - time behaviour of a rapidly rotating black - hole that is not at all well described in the standard terms ( as a signal mainly consisting of the leading qnm and the late - time power - law tail ) .",
    "instead , for an extreme black hole the long - lived modes completely dominate the late - time behaviour , by giving rise to an oscillating signal with an amplitude that decays as @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we present the complete derivation of this result , and discuss the extent to which it remains relevant also for astrophysical ( non - extreme ) black holes .      the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "part ii contains ( section iia & iib ) the formulation of the initial - value problem in the kerr geometry , a brief description of the analytic properties of the relevant green s function in the complex frequency plane ( section iic ) , and a discussion of the long - lived kerr qnms ( section iid ) .",
    "part ii then concludes with the calculation of the late - time field due to these modes , which leads to the main result of this paper ( section iie ) .",
    "section  iii concerns numerical time - evolutions and qnm signal reconstructions that amplify and strengthen the analytical results .",
    "in part iv we discuss a physical interpretation of the results , and introduce the concept of a `` superradiance resonance cavity '' .",
    "our conclusions are in part v. some technical details are discussed in appendices  a - c . in appendix",
    "a we present approximate solutions of the teukolsky equation for near extreme black holes first obtained by teukolsky and press @xcite . in appendix b the analytical properties of the solutions of the teukolsky equation are examined in some detail . finally , in appendix c , the realistic case of gravitational perturbations is briefly discussed . throughout the paper geometrised units @xmath37",
    "have been adopted .",
    "in the last decade several results have emphasized the surprising accuracy of black - hole perturbation theory in situations where one would intuitively expect it to fail .",
    "the most celebrated example of this is the close - limit approximation for black hole collisions devised by pullin and price @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that perturbative methods provide not only a benchmark test for fully nonlinear numerical relativity , but that it often offers a reliable alternative or complement @xcite .",
    "in fact , in many problems black - hole perturbation theory captures a significant part of the physics , although it obviously will not provide any insights into the non - linear behaviour ( unless taken to higher orders @xcite ) .",
    "perturbative studies are attractive because of their relative transparency .",
    "once we make the assumption that the perturbative field is weak in the sense that its contribution to the spacetime curvature can be neglected , the black hole evolution equations can be cast in the form of a wave equation with a complicated effective potential @xcite .",
    "this makes the initial - value problem amenable to an analytical ( or comparatively simple numerical ) treatment .",
    "furthermore , in studies where the emphasis is on the qualitative behaviour one can make further simplifications by considering a massless scalar field . since the more realistic cases of gravitational or electromagnetic fields are governed by perturbation equations very similar to the scalar wave equation",
    ", one would expect the simple toy problem ( recall that no scalar fields have not yet been observed in nature ) to provide generally relevant information .",
    "the advantage of the scalar field problem is simply that one does not have to go through the several steps involved in recreating ( say ) the perturbed metric from the employed variables .",
    "consequently , we mainly focus on the dynamics of a massless scalar field in the kerr background in this paper .",
    "but since some of our conclusions may prove relevant for future gravitational - wave detection we discuss the gravitational field problem in appendix c. the main conclusions drawn from this appendix is that all the results from the scalar field problem remain relevant also in the gravitational case .",
    "the standard formalism for studying kerr black hole perturbations is based on the newman - penrose approach . as was first shown by teukolsky almost thirty years ago",
    "@xcite , the evolution of any perturbative field can be described by a single `` master equation '' , which in the case of a scalar field takes the form @xmath38",

    "we assume that we can find a function @xmath62 such that @xmath63 where @xmath26 is an eigenvalue that ensures that @xmath64 is regular at both @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the angular eigenfunctions are then defined via a sturm - liouville problem for @xmath26 .",
    "the theory of such problems tells us that the eigenfunctions form a complete , orthogonal set on the interval @xmath67 for each combination of @xmath68 and @xmath0 . since the functions must limit to the standard spin - weighted spherical harmonics ( once the factor @xmath69 is included ) as @xmath70 it makes sense to label each eigenfunction by the integer @xmath7 ( with @xmath71 $ ] ) . in other words , we denote the solutions to ( [ angeq ] ) as @xmath72 .",
    "we further require that the eigenfunctions are normalised in such a way that @xmath73 with the bar denoting complex conjugation . by assuming that the left- and right - hand sides of ( [ unsep ] ) are both expanded in the complete set of angular functions , i.e. that @xmath74 etcetera",

    "the required green s function can be expressed in terms of two linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous version of ( [ radeq ] ) .",
    "these solutions are defined by their behaviour close to the event horizon and at spatial infinity in such a way that @xmath79 and @xmath80 here @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the angular velocity of the event horizon .",
    "finally , we have @xmath83    and the scalar field follows after inverting the integral transform : @xmath84 in this way we have arrived at a formal solution to the initial value problem for the teukolsky equation .",
    "our aim now is to analyse the kerr problem further and assess the level of excitation of the various qnms .",
    "it is generally accepted that this is a far from trivial problem , see @xcite for a detailed discussion , and we will not try to provide a complete solution here .",
    "instead , we will study a particular model scenario that allows us to make further simplifications .",
    "thus we use the so - called `` asymptotic approximation '' that was first introduced in @xcite , i.e. assume that i ) the observer is situated far away from the black hole , and ii ) the initial data has support only in the far zone ( but inside the observer ) .",
    "the first of these assumptions corresponds to @xmath85 , while the second means that @xmath86 .",
    "given these assumptions we can use the asymptotic behaviour ( [ up ] ) and ( [ in ] ) of the solutions to the teukolsky equation to construct the required green s function analytically .",
    "the asymptotic approximation is convenient , but is it realistic to introduce these two assumptions ?",
    "the assumption that the observer is located at large distances from the black hole should be relevant for most problems of astrophysical interest ( and we note that one could readily devise an analogous approximation for the case when the observer is located close to the horizon ) . furthermore , there is certainly a class of problems for which the second assumption holds .",
    "namely , when well - defined wave pulses fall onto the black hole .",
    "this is is a standard scenario considered in qualitative studies of black - hole dynamics , but it is not a scenario likely to give rise to detectable astrophysical gravitational waves . for the astrophysical scenarios that would seem the most relevant , gravitational collapse to form a black hole and the coalescence of two black holes following binary inspiral , the assumption that the `` initial data '' is located far from the horizon will not hold . but",
    "again , one could devise a similar approximation in which the data has support only close to the horizon . of course , we know from previous studies of related problems @xcite that the main qnm excitation arises from data in the region near the peak of the perturbative potential ( which is located near the unstable photon orbit ) . for such data",
    "the asymptotic approximation will not be accurate , and it is therefore likely to be of limited use in realistic scenarios .    anyway , once we introduce the asymptotic approximation , we get @xmath87 then , the solution to the radial teukolsky equation follows from @xmath88 ^ 2 } \\left\\ { { a^{\\rm out } \\over   a^{\\rm in } } e^{i\\omega r^\\prime_\\ast } + e^{-i\\omega r^\\prime_\\ast } \\right\\ } { \\cal s}_{l m}(\\omega , r^\\prime ) dr^\\prime_\\ast \\ .\\ ] ] and expression ( [ mfield ] ) for the field becomes @xmath89 d\\omega \\label{mfield2}\\ ] ] here we have defined the two integrals @xmath90 ^ 2 } e^{\\pm i\\omega r^{\\prime}_{\\ast } } { \\cal s}_{l m}(\\omega , r^\\prime ) dr^\\prime_\\ast\\ ] ] given specific initial data , the calculation of the field requires evaluation of the frequency integral in ( [ mfield2 ] ) .",
    "if we make further simplifications by assuming static initial data , i.e. @xmath91 , we arrive at @xmath92      in practice , the frequency integrals in ( [ mfield ] ) and ( [ mfield2 ] ) can not be directly evaluated analytically .",
    "it is a straightforward task to evaluate them numerically for any acceptable initial data , but this does not provide much insight into the qualitative features of the solution . as is by now well known ,",
    "a useful alternative is to analyze the problem in the complex @xmath36-plane @xcite . to do this",
    ", we bend the integration contour into the lower half of the complex frequency plane and use cauchy s theorem to calculate the integral as a sum over the contributions from the deformed contour plus a sum of the residues of the poles encircled by the contour . naturally , we need to understand the analytical properties of the green s function in order to follow this approach",
    ".    the properties of the schwarzschild black hole green s function have been exhaustively investigated , but the kerr case has not attracted nearly as much attention @xcite . we find that we must consider two different cases depending on whether we are interested in an extreme ( @xmath46 ) or a non - extreme ( @xmath44 ) black hole .",
    "the analytical properties of the green s function for the latter case are exactly as in the schwarzschild problem : an infinite set of simple poles , corresponding to the qnms , are located in the lower half plane and a branch point ( originating from the @xmath93 function ) at @xmath94 leads to a branch cut that is usually placed along the negative imaginary axis , cf .",
    "figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "the existence of this branch cut is related to the asymptotic behaviour of the effective potential in the teukolsky equation .",
    "namely the fact that the potential ( beyond the centrifugal term ) falls off as @xmath95 as @xmath96 , see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point .    for @xmath46",
    "we find an additional feature : the function @xmath97 now has a branch point at @xmath98 .",
    "this means that there will in principle be a second branch cut in the complex @xmath36-plane .",
    "this time , it is the behaviour of the potential at @xmath99 that leads to the presence of a branch cut .",
    "the effective potential near the horizon falls off as @xmath100 instead of exponentially ( as in the non - extreme case ) .",
    "the presence of this second branch cut is discussed further in appendix b.",
    "in analogy with standard scattering theory , the quasinormal modes can be interpreted as `` resonances '' of the black hole s gravitational field .",
    "this is apparent since they correspond to the poles of the green s function which , as can be seen from ( [ gasymp ] ) , means that they correspond to @xmath101 the physical interpretation of this is that the qnms correspond to waves that are purely outgoing at spatial infinity , while at the same time corresponding to purely ingoing waves crossing the event horizon . given this definition , it is straightforward to see that `` conservation laws '' force the solutions to ( [ qnmdef ] ) to be complex - valued @xcite ( in fact , for a kerr black hole , a qnm could exist on the real axis as well , but all attempts to find such modes have failed @xcite ) .",
    "it further turns out that there is an infinite set of such mode solutions for each given combination @xmath102 , corresponding to complex eigenfrequencies @xmath103 .",
    "the qnm spectra of non - rotating black holes have been exhaustively discussed in the literature and are by now well understood @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there have only been a few studies of the corresponding kerr problem .",
    "kerr black hole qnms were first calculated by detweiler @xcite .",
    "the most detailed calculations were done by leaver @xcite a few years later , and more recently onozawa @xcite extended leaver s continued fraction approach to discuss near - extreme black holes .",
    "kerr qnms and excitation coefficients have also been calculated by the present authors by integrating suitably chosen phase - functions along paths in the complex @xmath42-plane @xcite .",
    "these studies lead to the following conclusions : as the black hole spins up , each schwarzshild qnm ( belonging to an infinite family of modes for each @xmath7 ) splits into @xmath104 separate modes ( due to the breakdown of spherical symmetry which makes the various @xmath0 solutions distinct ) .",
    "how the modes are influenced by the black hole s rotation essentially depends on whether they are co- or counter - rotating with the black hole .",
    "one finds that modes that co - rotate ( @xmath105 ) with the black hole become longer lived as @xmath35 increases ( i.e. the imaginary part of the qnm frequency is significantly reduced ) . at the same time",
    "the oscillation frequency increases .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for the @xmath106 modes .",
    "in fact , as @xmath107 these modes all approach the @xmath98 point on the real frequency axis , cf . figure  3 in @xcite .",
    "this behaviour can be understood if we note that the @xmath106 modes can be interpreted as being `` associated with '' the black hole s equatorial plane ( cf . the symmetry of the spherical harmonics ) .",
    "if such a mode was co - rotating with the black hole it would experience maximal frame - dragging effects ( see @xcite for a particularly transparent treatment in the eikonal approximation ) .",
    "if we recall that the qnms can be associated with waves being trapped in the vicinity of the unstable photon orbit we see that , as the black hole approaches extreme rotation rates , the co - rotating modes will be located closer and closer to the horizon until at @xmath46 when the frequency of these `` equatorial '' modes is a multiple of the rotation frequency of the horizon ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this then makes the extremely slow damping of these qnms natural .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to understand why other qnms are less effected by rotation .",
    "other co - rotating modes , with @xmath108 , will be dragged along with the black hole but they never become extremely long - lived ( essentially because they are not symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane ) . and",
    "the `` counter - rotating '' modes are much less affected by rotation , remaining close to their schwarzschild counterparts as the black hole spins up .",
    "these qualitative results are the same for all perturbative fields ( gravitational , electromagnetic or scalar ) .",
    "we aim to investigate the extent to which the extremely long - lived qnms of a rapidly spinning black hole are excited by a generic perturbation . as outlined in the introduction ,",
    "the main motivation for this study is the question whether one should expect these modes to be present in the gravitational - wave signal from astrophysical black holes .",
    "if this were the case , such signals would be considerably easier to detect than the short bursts that would be characteristic of a schwarzschild black hole .    as demonstrated by detweiler @xcite",
    ", the long - lived qnms can be obtained analytically using an approximation to the teukolsky equation that is valid for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "the condition ( [ modecond ] ) should , however , remain valid for a larger range of spin - rates .",

    "the equations above are , however , somewhat complicated and it is useful to consider the @xmath46 case for which they simplify considerably .",

    "the second integral in ( [ bc2lm ] ) can be evaluated using arguments similar to the ones involved in the derivation of ( [ bctail ] ) .",
    "we end up with an exponentially decaying field that can be neglected compared to ( [ qtail ] ) .",
    "finally , we have to consider the contribution from the remaining qnms .",
    "but because all these modes are `` short - lived '' their contribution is important only during the early phase of qnm ringing , cf .",
    "the schwarzschild results @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of this section is that even though the contribution of each long lived qnm to the emerging field is exponentially small , the total mode contribution can not be neglected . when summed , the slowly damped qnms of an extreme kerr black hole give rise to an oscillating signal whose magnitude falls off with time as a power - law .",
    "this result is particularly interesting since the decay of this signal is considerably slower than the standard power - law tail in the kerr case @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that oscillating power - laws are known to arise in standard scattering theory whenever the green s function has multiple poles @xcite . in our case",
    ", one could argue that it is the exponentially small `` spacing '' between neighbouring poles ( see expression ( [ llmodes ] ) ) that causes the @xmath1 power - law .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the prediction ( [ longcoeff ] ) for the excitation of each individual long - lived qnm agrees with the intuitive arguments we made in the introduction .",
    "for example , we see that the leading qnm is _ not _ excited for @xmath46 ( as it corresponds to the limit @xmath192 in ( [ longcoeff ] ) ) .",
    "this is in agreement with , and generalises , the @xmath193 result ( which is valid only for the fundamental mode ) obtained in @xcite using the eikonal approximation .",
    "in the previous section we used analytic approximations to analyze the long - lived qnms of a near extreme kerr black hole .",
    "we obtained results that agree with our anticipations that these modes would not individually be excited to a significant level .",
    "but our calculation also provided surprises , the most important being that the large number of slowly damped qnms combine to give a significant signal the amplitude of which falls of as @xmath1 at late times .",
    "however , in view of the many approximations involved in the derivation of ( [ qtail ] ) considerable caution is warranted , and a confirmation of the analytic prediction is desirable .",
    "one way to obtain support for the results would be to perform time - evolutions of the teukolsky equation from given initial data .",
    "in other words , the recent effort to develop a framework for doing perturbative time - evolutions for kerr black holes @xcite provides the means for testing our analytical predictions .    we have performed a set of evolutions ( for various values of @xmath0 ) using the same scalar field code that was used to study superradiance in a dynamical context @xcite . as initial data",
    "we have chosen a generic gaussian pulse originally located far away from the black hole .",
    "the evolution of this pulse , as it travels towards the black hole and excites the qnm ringing is then studied .",
    "the numerical results we obtain support the following conclusions : i ) in the case of extreme kerr black holes ( @xmath46 ) we verify the predicted oscillating @xmath1 behaviour for all @xmath194 , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "ii ) for @xmath44 we recover the anticipated exponential fall - off at late times , cf . @xcite . still , the emerging signal differs considerably from a single qnm oscillation at intermediate times for near extreme black holes .",
    "this agrees well with the analytical results from the previous section : for near extreme black holes a large number of long - lived qnms are excited to roughly the same level , and for a considerable time window the resulting signal is a superposition of many slowly decaying exponentials ( each with a very small amplitude ) . as we depart further from @xmath46 we retain the standard result : the signal is completely dominated by the slowest damped qnm .",
    "iii ) for axisymmetric perturbations ( @xmath195 ) the numerical evolution recovers the standard power - law tail . for our particular choice of initial data ( that contains the @xmath196 multipole )",
    "the tail falls off as @xmath197 .",
    "this agrees with the predictions of , for example , ori and barack @xcite .",
    "although our numerical simulations generally support the analytic results , there is still room for some caution .",
    "it is very difficult to investigate the late - time behaviour of a perturbed kerr black hole using the teukolsky code .",
    "after all , we would like to be able to distinguish a slowly damped exponential from an oscillating power - law at very late times .",
    "given our current numerical code we can not obtained absolute proof of our analytic results .",
    "detailed convergence tests show that the code has the expected properties , but also unveil that it is difficult to reliably determine the late time oscillating tail predicted by our analytical work . while the overall amplitude envelope can be determined for many hundred dynamical timescales as the resolution",
    "is increased , the signal typically goes out of phase on a shorter timescale .",
    "this means that , even though the numerical results provide support for our theoretical predictions , one would have to build an evolution code that could be trusted at very late times , eg .",
    "based on a double - null evolution , in order to obtain definite results .",
    "in addition to investigating the late - time field through direct numerical evolutions , we can reconstruct it from our analytical results . using expressions ( [ qnmfield ] ) - ( [ fderiv ] )",
    "it is a straightforward task to calculate the long - lived qnm signal provided that we have already acquired the corresponding mode - frequencies . in this way",
    "one can expect to obtain a fairly accurate description of the full signal for sufficiently late times ( i.e. after some e - folding times of the dominant short - lived qnm : typically the slowest damped @xmath198 mode ) , spanning a time window of several hundred dynamical timescales .",
    "eventually one would expect this signal ( after all , it decays exponentially ) to give way to the standard power - law tail .",
    "however , as is clear from all our illustrations this will not happen until at very very late times .    in table  [ tab1 ] we present a small subset of our numerical data for long - lived qnms frequencies and the corresponding excitation coefficents for near extreme black holes .",
    "as anticipated , these amplitudes vanish as @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , as already pointed out , the higher overtones are excited to a level comparable to the leading mode . in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we illustrate the typical field as constructed from the long - lived qnms . for this particular calculation ,",
    "we have chosen , as initial data , a gaussian pulse with angular dependence @xmath199 .",
    "it follows then from ( [ qnmfield ] ) , that only the @xmath29 field component will be important at late times .",
    "the result in figure  [ fig5 ] should be compared to the fully numerical evolution data in figures  [ fig4]-[twomode ] .",
    "our analytical results , supported by the outcome of numerical evolutions , give rise to an intriguing picture .",
    "it would seem as if the extremely long - lived qnms will , even though they are hardly excited at all individually , dominate the signal from a very rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "the emergence of this late - time signal , to which many qnms contribute would be a new phenomenon in black - hole physics .",
    "given that both the standard qnms and the power - law tail have simple intuitive explanations it may be worthwhile trying to understand the extreme kerr case in a similar way . from the evidence provided by our numerical evolutions ,",
    "see figure  [ fig8 ] , we propose the following `` explanation '' .",
    "consider the fate of an essentially monochromatic wave that falls onto the black hole , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] for a schematic description .",
    "provided that the frequency is in the interval @xmath200 the wave will be superradiant : scattering of these waves in the black hole s ergosphere results in their amplification by extraction of the black hole s rotational energy . in effect , this means that a distant observer will see waves `` emerging from the horizon '' , cf .",
    "( [ in ] ) , even though a local observer sees the waves crossing the event horizon ( at @xmath201 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , one can establish that the effective potential has a peak outside the black hole ( which is not immediately obvious since the `` potential '' @xmath202 is frequency dependent in the kerr case ) for a range of frequencies including the superradiant interval .",
    "indeed , we can find the following approximate expression for the potential near the horizon ( valid for @xmath46 only ) @xmath203 this shows that , for @xmath110 , there will be a peak ( corresponding to a minimum of @xmath202 ) just outside the horizon .",
    "this can be verified by graphing the exact potential ( [ potent ] ) , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] .    the combination of the causal boundary condition at the horizon effectively corresponding to waves `` coming out of the black hole '' ( according to a distant observer ) and the presence of a potential peak leads to waves potentially being trapped in the region close to the horizon . in effect , there is a `` superradiance resonance cavity '' outside the black hole .",
    "again according to a distant observer , waves can only escape from this cavity by leakage through the potential barrier to infinity .",
    "since the superradiant amplification is strongest for frequencies close to @xmath204 , waves in the cavity experience a kind of parametric amplification and at very late times the dominant oscillation frequency ought to be @xmath204 .",
    "this is exactly what we have deduced from our analytic and numerical calculations . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we present a series of snapshots of the evolution of a scalar field around an extreme kerr black hole . in this series of pictures",
    "one can see how `` trapped '' oscillations develop in the vicinity of the black hole s horizon .",
    "after an initial drop in amplitude ( roughly at the timescale of the e - folding time of the rapidly damped `` schwarzschild - like '' qnms ) these oscillations decay very slowly .",
    "these snapshots indicate the presence of a standing wave in the region just outside the horizon . in the extreme black hole case leakage from the superradiance cavity",
    "leads to the observed @xmath1 decay . in the near extreme case",
    ", the existence of the cavity provides an intuitive explanation for the extremely slow damping of corotating qnms with frequencies close to @xmath204 . in a way",
    ", the superradiance cavity we have described here can be viewed as the black hole analogue of the potential `` well '' present in the gravitational field of ultracompact stars @xcite which also leads to the existence of a long - lived family of @xmath205-modes @xcite .",
    "we have presented the results of an investigation into the late - time behaviour of a perturbed kerr black hole .",
    "an analytic calculation for scalar fields in the geometry of an extreme kerr black hole provided two important results .",
    "the first concerns the level of excitation of the qnms that become very slowly damped as @xmath22 .",
    "we find that these modes are much more difficult to excite than their rapidly damped schwarzschild counterparts .",
    "this means that ( individually ) these modes may not be easy to detect with the new generation of gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "however , there may still be a detectable , slowly damped , qnm signal owing to the fact that a large number of virtually undamped qnms exist for each value of @xmath194 .",
    "we find that these modes combine in such a way that the field oscillates with an amplitude that decays as @xmath1 at late times .",
    "this decay is considerably slower than the standard power - law tail .",
    "we have used numerical time - evolutions of the teukolsky equation to verify this analytic prediction for extreme black holes .    after extending our study to near extreme black holes we find that , even though the qnm signal decays exponentially in the familiar way , there is still a considerable time interval where a large number of small - amplitude slowly - damped qnms are present in the signal .",
    "this means that the signal from a rapidly spinning black hole would not be well represented by a single qnm approximation . only at very late times",
    "do the leading mode become dominant and eventually it should give way to the power - law tail predicted in previous work @xcite .",
    "whether our results are astrophysically relevant or not is in many ways still an open question . in particular , the excitation of the long - lived qnms by more realistic initial data ( representing , for example , the close - limit approximation of merging kerr black holes ) must be studied .",
    "one should obviously also try to understand whether one would expect to find almost extreme black holes in nature ( recall that thorne @xcite has shown that accretion can not spin a black hole up beyond @xmath206 ) .",
    "it seems quite reasonable , however , to expect that the effects we have observed will play a role at intermediate times for rapidly rotating non - extreme black holes .",
    "if our predictions are correct one must investigate in detail to what extent the late - time signals from a rapidly rotating black - hole are detectable even though they contain a large number of qnms ( each with a small amplitude ) .",
    "in particular , it is crucial to determine whether one can hope to infer the black - hole parameters from a signal that contains such a superposition of qnms ( perhaps using techniques similar to those introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether there exists a critical value of the rotation parameter @xmath35 above which the new effect we have observed becomes relevant ( recall that our approximate modes are only relevant for @xmath109 ) .",
    "more detailed numerical work is needed to answer this question .",
    "finally , we note that the observed phenomenon can be intuitively explained in terms of a `` superradiance resonance cavity '' outside the black hole , in which waves of certain frequencies are effectively trapped .",
    "as the waves slowly leak out from this cavity , they give rise the `` long - lived '' qnm signal observed at infinity . in conclusion , it is interesting to note that , even though black - hole perturbations is a very well researched field , it can still provide interesting and surprising results .",
