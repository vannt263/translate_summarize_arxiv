    "the electroweak phase transition is an appealing scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , since it contains the three necessary ingredients known as sakharov s conditions , namely , baryon number violation , @xmath1 and @xmath2 violation , and a departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , to obtain a quantitatively successful electroweak baryogenesis , one has to consider some extension of the standard model ( sm ) in which there is enough @xmath2 violation as well as a sufficiently strong first - order phase transition ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the order parameter used to measure the strength of the elecroweak phase transition is the mean value of the higgs field in the broken symmetry phase at the critical temperature , @xmath3 .    in the standard mechanism for electroweak baryogenesis , which assumes a first - order phase transition , the non - equilibrium condition acts in two different ways .",
    "the first of them is through the expansion of bubbles of the stable phase , which combined with @xmath2 violation inside the walls of bubbles produce non - equilibrium particle densities , which then give rise to the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the second effect of the departure from equilibrium is connected to the baryon number violation condition : baryon number violating processes must be turned off before the system reaches thermal equilibrium in order to avoid the washout of the generated bau .    in the expansion of bubbles an asymmetry between left handed quarks and their antiparticles ( and an opposite right handed asymmetry )",
    "is built up in front of the moving walls .",
    "this asymmetry biases the anomalous , baryon number violating sphaleron processes present in the high temperature phase .",
    "thus , bubble walls must have a nonvanishing velocity to generate a net baryon asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the left - handed asymmetry injected in front of the wall needs some time to diffuse and bias the sphaleron processes before the reflected particles are re - caught by the wall .",
    "if the wall moves too fast , there wo nt be enough time for sphalerons to produce baryons . as a consequence ,",
    "the generated baryon asymmetry has a peak at some small velocity which depends on the time scales associated to particle diffusion and baryon number violation @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the mssm the peak is at @xmath4 .",
    "the chiral quark asymmetry generated in front of the bubble wall depends also on the wall thickness .",
    "if the wall width is small compared to the inverse temperature , the @xmath2-violating reflection of particles by the bubble wall can be treated quantum mechanically @xcite . otherwise ,",
    "the effect of @xmath2 violation acts as a classical force on the quarks as they pass through the wall @xcite .",
    "this is the case in the electroweak phase transition , since the wall width has been estimated to be @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry will thus also depend on @xmath6 , resulting a larger asymmetry for thinner walls .    regarding the avoiding of washout , sphaleron processes must be suppressed in the broken phase so that baryons that are created in front of the moving wall are not erased after entering the bubble .",
    "this requirement imposes a constraint on the sphaleron energy which can be expressed as the well known condition for the higgs mean value @xcite @xmath7 this condition gives a severe constraint for the theory of the electroweak interactions . indeed ,",
    "the minimal sm is unable to explain the observed bau , since in this model the phase transition is not of the first order , but only a smooth crossover @xcite .",
    "furthermore , electroweak baryogenesis constrains the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to a small region of parameter space , where the higgs mass is less than about @xmath8 and the stop mass is less than the top one @xcite .    from the above it",
    "becomes apparent that phase transition dynamics plays a relevant role in electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "being the baryon production very sensitive to the bubble wall width and velocity , and to the higgs mean value , it is important to determine as accurately as possible the values of these parameters at the actual temperature of the phase transition .",
    "indeed , all of these parameters vary significantly in the temperature interval in which the first - order phase transition can take place , that is to say , between the critical temperature @xmath9 at which the two phases have the same free energy and the temperature @xmath10 at which the barrier between the two minima of free energy disappears .",
    "the exact temperature @xmath0 of the transition depends on the evolution of the bubbles after they are nucleated , which in turn depends on the viscosity of the plasma .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze in detail the dependence on temperature of the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , and we will determine the relative position of the temperature @xmath0 in the interval @xmath13 .",
    "we will do this computation for different values of the parameters of our model , placing emphasis on those that adequate to the context of the mssm .",
    "we will also discuss several aspects of the phase transition dynamics , such as transitory states in the evolution of the higgs field , or the possibility that the transition occurs near the temperature @xmath14 , where the mechanism of baryogenesis would be different from the usual one .",
    "the plan is the following .",
    "in the next section we introduce our model for the first - order elecroweak phase transition , and calculate the shape of the nucleated bubbles as a function of temperature . in section [ growth ]",
    "we study the subsequent evolution of the bubbles in the hot plasma . in section [ temp ]",
    "we determine a temperature interval outside which the phase transition can not occur , independently of the bubble evolution .",
    "finally , in section [ develop ] we compute the temperature and duration of the transition and discuss the implications for baryogenesis . in the appendix",
    "we show some details of the numerical calculation .",
    "the electroweak phase transition takes place when the expectation value of the higgs field passes from its high temperature value @xmath15 to its nonzero value in the low temperature broken phase .",
    "we will use a simple model for the phase transition , which is nevertheless representative of the electroweak theory at high temperature .",
    "we will assume that the free energy has the well known general form @xcite @xmath16 which will be suitable for our analysis , since it contains the essential features of the first order phase transition .",
    "moreover , it can be a very good approximation to the actual effective potential .",
    "this is for instance the form of the perturbative high temperature effective potential in the sm @xcite . even in the mssm , which has two higgs doublets",
    ", the free energy takes the sm - like form ( [ pot ] ) in the limit in which the pseudoscalar particle of the higgs sector is heavy ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "all the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) depend on the particle content of the theory .",
    "parameter @xmath18 contains contributions from all the particles that acquire their masses through the higgs mechanism .",
    "these contributions are of the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the zero - temperature mass of particle @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the zero - temperature vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "parameter @xmath23 has only boson contributions , of the form @xmath24 . in the sm we have @xmath25 , @xmath26 , while in the mssm , due to the larger particle zoo , @xmath18 and @xmath23 can be more than an order of magnitude larger than in the sm .",
    "parameter @xmath27 is in general temperature dependent , but it is almost constant in the range of temperatures in which the phase transition can take place .",
    "this parameter is very sensitive to the higgs mass and for our discussion we will assume it to be given parametrically by @xmath28 .",
    "the cubic term in @xmath29 is responsible for the first - order feature of the phase transition , by causing the coexistence of two minima separated by a barrier .",
    "hence , the strength of the transition depends on the value of parameter @xmath23 . at high temperature",
    "the global minimum of the potential is at @xmath30 . at the critical temperature",
    "@xmath31 the two minima become degenerate , and below this temperature the stable minimum of @xmath32 is at @xmath33 at temperature @xmath10 the barrier between minima disappears , and @xmath30 becomes a maximum of the potential .",
    "the exact value of @xmath10 depends on the parameters of the theory , but we can assume it to be roughly @xmath34 since the dynamics of the phase transition is not very sensitive to the value of this constant .",
    "the number @xmath35 is in general small , and the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath36 .",
    "however , as we shall see , things change rapidly as the temperature falls from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "hence it proves useful to define a dimensionless variable @xmath37 which goes from @xmath38 to @xmath39 as @xmath40 runs between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    at the critical temperature , eq .",
    "( [ fimin ] ) gives @xmath41 . inserting this value into the condition for avoiding the washout of the baryon asymmetry [ eq .",
    "( [ washout ] ) ] , gives the constraint @xmath42 . in the sm",
    "this results in the bound on the higgs mass @xmath43 , well below the experimental bound @xmath44 . in the mssm , the one loop stop contribution increases the value of parameter @xmath23 , but this contribution is limited by the danger of inducing charge and color breaking minima . as a consequence , the bound on @xmath45 can be shifted only to @xmath46 , provided that the light stop mass is in the range @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that two loop corrections produce an enhancement of the strength of the phase transition , leading to an upper bound on the higgs mass of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ washout ] ) is written in terms of the critical temperature @xmath9 , this condition is somewhat inexact , since at @xmath9 the nucleation of bubbles has not yet begun . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase transition must be completed when the temperature of the universe is still above @xmath10 , because bubbles of the true phase are copiously produced as the barrier between minima gets small and disappears .",
    "hence , the transition takes place at an intermediate temperature @xmath49 with @xmath50 the temperature @xmath0 is usually estimated by the condition @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the fluctuation in free energy which is necessary for bubble formation @xcite .",
    "however , as was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more careful determination of the temperature @xmath0 is important , because the rate of anomalous baryon number violation is an exponentially sensitive function of @xmath12 . in the effective potential ( [ pot ] ) , @xmath12 varies from @xmath53 at temperature @xmath9 to @xmath54 at @xmath10 .",
    "this variation by a factor of @xmath55 gives an uncertainty of a 50% in the bound on the higgs mass coming from eq .",
    "( [ washout ] ) .",
    "elimination of this uncertainty is thus essential given the current experimental bounds on @xmath56 .",
    "so the correct condition for avoiding the washout of the baryon asymmetry would be , according to eq .",
    "( [ fimin ] ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a number between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , to be evaluated at the temperature of the phase transition , @xmath0 .      at a temperature below @xmath9",
    ", bubbles of the low temperature phase begin to nucleate .",
    "the thermal tunneling probability ( per unit volume and time ) for bubble nucleation is @xcite @xmath61 the prefactor @xmath62 is roughly of order @xmath63 ( so we will set @xmath64 ) , and @xmath65 is the three - dimensional instanton action , which coincides with the free energy of the nucleated bubble . at high temperature",
    "the bounce solution is @xmath66 symmetric , and the corresponding action takes the simple form @xmath67 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 , and the equation for the configuration of the bubble is @xmath69 with the boundary conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    for temperatures close to @xmath9 ,",
    "the width of the bubble wall at the moment of formation is much smaller than its radius , and @xmath52 can be expressed as a function of the bubble radius @xmath72 , the energy difference @xmath73 between the two minima of the potential , and the bubble wall surface energy @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the radius of the critical bubble to be nucleated can thus be obtained by finding an extremum of @xmath75 .",
    "a similar approximation can be used to estimate the radius of a thick - walled bubble ( i.e. , outside the range of validity of the thin wall approximation ) @xcite .",
    "however , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , one must be very careful when evaluating @xmath52 in this way . since the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ecfi ] ) is a _",
    "maximum _ of the action , the corresponding value of @xmath52 will be higher than the action of any approximate solution . as a consequence one can strongly overestimate the tunneling probability , leading to a sooner completion of the phase transition .    for the potential ( [ pot ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ ecfi ] ) can be solved numerically and then integrated to obtain the action @xmath52 , which can be expressed as a function of a dimensionless parameter @xmath76 , @xmath77 dine _ _ et al .  _",

    "using the same procedure we have calculated the radius @xmath72 of the nucleated bubble , the thickness @xmath6 of its wall , and the value of the higgs field inside it , @xmath84 , as functions of @xmath85 .",
    "the calculation is described in the appendix .",
    "notice that the dimensionless function @xmath58 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ fimin ] ) and ( [ lambdae ] ) has also a simple expression as a function of @xmath85 , @xmath86    figure  [ figrl ] illustrates the behavior of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "near the critical temperature ( @xmath89 ) the bubbles that nucleate are thin - walled ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this is because the energy difference between the two minima of the potential is much smaller than the energy barrier between them .",
    "in such a case the radius must be very large , so that the negative potential energy inside the volume of the bubble is able to compete with the positive surface energy . as @xmath91 increases , the wall width becomes of the same order of the radius and the thin wall approximation breaks down .",
    "for @xmath92 the size of the critical bubbles diverges .",
    "this is because the width of the bubble wall is associated to the correlation length , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 .",
    "this divergence is easily understood by looking at the shape of the bubbles .",
    "figure  [ shape ] shows the bubble profile at a temperature near @xmath9 ( @xmath95 ) , a temperature near @xmath10 ( @xmath96 ) , and at an intermediate temperature ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that the value of the higgs field inside the bubble decreases with @xmath91 .    in fig .",
    "[ figfi ] we have plotted this value together with the minimum of the potential @xmath98 for comparison . at @xmath89 the value of @xmath84 coincides with that of @xmath99 . however , as the temperature decreases from the critical one , this value moves away from the minimum of @xmath100 and goes to zero .",
    "this behavior is due the decreasing of the height of the barrier and the increasing in the energy difference between minima . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath101 inside the bubble needs not anymore to be exactly at the minimum of the potential to get enough volume energy .",
    "moreover , as the barrier between minima disappears , it becomes easier to form a large bubble with a small value of @xmath102 inside it .",
    "therefore , near the temperature @xmath10 , bubbles with @xmath103 and @xmath104 will be formed .",
    "consequently , if for any reason the transition does not occur until the temperature is close to @xmath10 , then it will tend to proceed by a homogeneous growing of the order parameter @xmath102 , instead of by the nucleation and expansion of bubbles .",
    "this is not surprising since , without a barrier , one expects the field to `` roll down '' homogeneously towards the minimum of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "there would still be some baryon number generation in such a scenario , due to the coherent variation of the @xmath2 violating field @xmath105 , which would produce an effective chemical potential for baryon number .",
    "however , this would be a kind of local baryogenesis @xcite mechanism , and hence it would lack the enhancement due to diffusion , which characterizes the usual non - local electroweak baryogenesis . furthermore , after rolling down the field will start to oscillate around the minimum of the potential until all its energy is transferred to the plasma .",
    "this oscillations can further spoil the generated baryon asymmetry , depending on their amplitude .",
    "this effect would be avoided in a phase transition at a higher scale , where the motion of @xmath106 would be strongly damped by the expansion of the universe apart from the damping due to the plasma .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see in section [ temp ] that the phase transition is unlikely to occur beyond @xmath107 , so the value of @xmath102 inside the bubbles at the moment of nucleation will not be far from @xmath98 .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ figrl ] that the wall thickness is almost constant up to that value of @xmath91 , so we can anticipate that the width @xmath108 , ( which enters the generated baryon number ) , will depend weakly on the temperature of the phase transition .",
    "after a bubble is formed , it starts to grow due to the pressure difference between the phases separated by the bubble wall , @xmath109 . after a short acceleration stage , the wall reaches a terminal velocity which depends on its interaction with the plasma . in this section",
    "we will analyze the evolution of bubbles from the moment they are nucleated until they fill the universe      if the time it takes a bubble wall to accelerate up to terminal velocity is much smaller than the time it propagates before colliding with other bubbles , then the initial acceleration stage can be ignored . in order to check that this is the case , we can estimate the time needed for the wall to reach terminal velocity from the equation of motion for @xmath102 in the plasma , eq .",
    "( [ ew3 ] ) below .",
    "if the field is strongly damped the wall will reach terminal velocity faster than without damping , so using eq .",
    "( [ ew3 ] ) without the damping term one can estimate the maximum acceleration time @xcite .",
    "in such a case the wall reaches the speed of light in a time @xmath110 . for the values of the parameters of @xmath111 that we will consider , this gives @xmath112 .    in order to compare this time with the typical times associated with the phase transition",
    ", we need the relation between the temperature of the universe and time . at the radiation - dominated era it is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the plank mass , and",
    "@xmath115 is a factor that depends on the effective degrees of freedom of the plasma .",
    "near the temperature of the electroweak phase transition , @xmath116 .",
    "the time elapsed between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for instance , is @xmath117 which is many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath118 .",
    "however , to check if the short acceleration assumption is correct we must compare @xmath118 with the time in which a typical bubble propagates until all space is filled by broken symmetry bubbles .",
    "this time is of the order of the duration of the phase transition @xmath119 , which is less than @xmath120 .",
    "we will see in section [ develop ] that @xmath121 , so @xmath122 .",
    "the assumption is thus valid .",
    "there is another transitory stage , associated with the growing of @xmath102 in the interior of the bubble . as seen in fig .",
    "[ figfi ] , bubbles nucleate with a value of the field inside them , @xmath123 , that is less than that of the minimum of the potential @xmath98 .",
    "this fact can be important for the bubble wall propagation , since the pressure difference @xmath124 that pushes the wall would then be less than @xmath125 . again , we can use eq .",
    "( [ ew3 ] ) , this time discarding all spatial derivatives , to calculate the time in which @xmath126 grows from @xmath84 to @xmath22 . neglecting the damping term we obtain @xmath127 . for @xmath128",
    "this gives @xmath129 . with a damping term",
    "it will take the field a longer time to get to @xmath22 . assuming a typical damping @xmath130 ( see below )",
    ", we obtain @xmath131 , which is again much less than @xmath119 .",
    "we can therefore safely assume that @xmath132 , and that bubble walls move with constant velocity through the plasma .",
    "the friction on the bubble wall depends on the departure from equilibrium of the particle distributions near the wall @xcite .",
    "particles which interact with the higgs field in such a way that their masses change across the bubble wall profile will feel a force as they are caught by the propagating wall .",
    "integration of these forces weighted with the particle distributions gives the total force exerted on the wall by the plasma .",
    "when equilibrium distributions appropriate for the local value of @xmath102 are considered , this force only accounts for the finite temperature part of @xmath133 , and does not depend on the wall velocity .",
    "nevertheless , a departure from equilibrium is in fact produced by the motion of the wall .",
    "particles that , for energetic reasons , can not penetrate the wall , are reflected in front of it .",
    "these particles slow down the wall by giving momentum to it , and this effect becomes more important the faster the wall moves . expanding the non - equilibrium particle distributions to first order in the wall velocity , the force gets a contribution proportional to the wall velocity @xcite .",
    "the terminal velocity is thus obtained by equating this frictional force with @xmath133 .",
    "the propagation of the bubble wall can also be affected by hydrodynamics ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "although hydrodynamic considerations are important for large velocities , if the wall velocity is small the only important effect is a global reheating due to the latent heat released by the expanding bubbles @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the velocity of the bubble wall is less than the speed of sound in the relativistic plasma @xmath134 , it propagates as a deflagration front .",
    "this means that a shock front precedes the wall , with a velocity @xmath135 .",
    "hence , the latent heat is transmitted away from the wall .",
    "if the wall velocity is small enough , the latent heat has time to distribute throughout space , causing a homogeneous reheating of the plasma as the wall propagates .",
    "there exist other effects that can influence the growth of bubbles .",
    "an example is that of strong magnetic fields that can be formed before @xcite or during @xcite the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the presence of these fields changes the free energy difference between phases , thus affecting the temperature and strength of the first order phase transition @xcite . in the case",
    "that the magnetic fields are generated during the electroweak phase transition , they can delay the completion of the latter by strongly affecting the evolution of bubbles @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the bubble wall in the hot plasma can be derived by energy conservation considerations @xcite , @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the deviation from the equilibrium distribution function for particle species @xmath21 in the heat bath .",
    "the last term can be expressed @xcite as a frictional damping term proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "due to lorentz invariance this term must be of the form @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the four - velocity of the plasma .",
    "( [ ew1 ] ) then becomes @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a dimensionless damping coefficient that depends on the viscosity of the medium , and is obtained by calculating the deviations @xmath143 near the wall .",
    "the calculation of the friction is usually treated with kinetic theory @xcite , giving for the standard model roughly @xmath144 .",
    "however , it was noticed @xcite that infrared boson excitations which are treated classically @xcite , increase the value of @xmath142 by an order of magnitude . in the mssm",
    "there is an additional enhancement of the friction due to the larger particle content of the model . in ref .",
    "@xcite the contribution of a light right - handed stop has been calculated , which added to the contributions of tops and @xmath145 bosons give a lower bound on the friction coefficient of @xmath146 .",
    "we will not take into account other effects such as the influence of magnetic fields on the bubble growth .",
    "instead , we will consider values of the friction beyond @xmath130 to allow for the possibility of additional damping , and we will assume that that kind of effects can be parametrized in this way .",
    "accordingly , we will let @xmath142 vary in the range @xmath147 .",
    "the nucleated bubbles grow rapidly to a size large enough so that we can go to 1 + 1 dimensions . boosting to a frame that moves with the wall and assuming stationary motion in the @xmath148 direction we then have @xmath149 where @xmath150 . multiplying both sides by @xmath151 and integrating over @xmath152",
    ", we obtain a formula for the wall velocity , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the free energy difference between the two phases and @xmath155 is the surface tension of the wall , @xmath156 we have assumed here that temperature is constant across the wall .",
    "this is right if the wall velocity is small enough that the latent heat it releases has time to be uniformly distributed throughout space @xcite .",
    "if we use the well known kink approximation for the wall profile ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath157 \\ , \\ ] ] then the surface energy ( [ sigma ] ) is @xmath158 , and the wall velocity is given by @xmath159    we see from eq .",
    "( [ veloc ] ) that @xmath11 increases with @xmath6 .",
    "this is because the thicker the bubble wall , the slower will be the variation of @xmath106 as the wall sweeps through a given point in the plasma , and consequently , the smaller the disturbance of the plasma near the wall .",
    "hence , thicker walls experience a smaller friction force from the medium .",
    "since @xmath6 diverges at @xmath10 , one can infer that the dependence of the velocity with the wall width gives an important variation of @xmath11 with temperature . in the literature , however , @xmath6 is usually evaluated near the critical temperature . for instance , it is often roughly approximated by the correlation length @xmath160 @xcite , or it is taken from the wall profile at the temperature at which @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath162 for the electroweak bubble .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ figrl ] that these approximations are good as long as the phase transition completes before the temperature gets close to @xmath10 , since @xmath6 is almost constant until @xmath163 .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the phase transition hardly occurs beyond that value of @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ vw ] shows the terminal velocity of the bubble wall as a function of @xmath91 . in the interval",
    "@xmath164 it varies from @xmath165 ( since @xmath166 at the critical temperature ) to @xmath167 ( since @xmath168 for @xmath92 ) .",
    "note , however , that at the beginning of the interval the wall velocity grows rapidly from @xmath169 to some value proportional to @xmath170 , then it becomes rather insensitive to @xmath91 , and finally it grows again up to @xmath167 . as we shall see , the electroweak phase transition generally occurs at some intermediate @xmath91 so , for fixed @xmath142 , the wall velocity will not be very sensitive to the temperature of the transition .",
    "once a bubble has nucleated , its wall rapidly reaches the terminal velocity @xmath171 , which depends on temperature . due to the large time - temperature relationship ( [ ttrad ] )",

    "all the quantities appearing in the integral are in fact functions of temperature , so the use of the time - temperature relation ( [ ttrad ] ) will be needed in the computation .",
    "some reheating will occur at the end of the transition due to collisions of bubble walls .",
    "however , for small wall velocities this effect should not be important . as we have already mentioned , the main consequence of the release of energy by slowly - expanding bubbles is a global reheating _ during _ the bubble expansion stage , which would manifest itself by changing the time - temperature relation . taking into account",
    "this effect would require solving the two coupled equations for @xmath183 and @xmath184 , which is outside the scope of the present paper . before going on , however",

    "@xcite , one can get an idea of how important the reheating is by comparing the latent heat @xmath185 with the energy needed to bring the plasma back up to @xmath9 from @xmath0 , @xmath186 where the factor @xmath187 depends on the number of effectively massless degrees of freedom . at the time of the electroweak phase transition @xmath188 .",
    "since @xmath189 , the energy density difference will be @xmath190 .",
    "for sm values of @xmath18 and @xmath23 , the latent heat is smaller than @xmath191 by one or two orders of magnitude , depending on the value of @xmath27 . for mssm values of the parameters , instead , @xmath192 can be of the same order of magnitude of @xmath193 .",
    "in such a case the latent heat released by the bubbles could reheat the plasma back up to temperatures near @xmath9 .",
    "so we must remark that this effect might be important for baryogenesis .",
    "due to the small velocity of the bubble walls , the gradually released latent heat will prevent the temperature of the bath to decrease , rather than reheating the plasma at the end of the transition .",
    "if the temperature stays close to @xmath9 , the pressure difference @xmath133 across the bubble walls will be small , and hence the wall velocity can decrease considerably from the current estimations @xcite .",
    "the progress of the phase transition is determined by the fraction of space @xmath194 that is still in the symmetric phase , given by eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) . in the next section",
    "we will calculate the temperature @xmath0 of the transition and its duration @xmath195 for different values of the friction .",
    "however , since the exact evolution of the bubble wall velocity is not known , it will be convenient to begin our analysis by putting reliable constraints on @xmath0 inside the interval @xmath196 .",
    "we will consider two sets of values for the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath18 of the potential : those corresponding to the sm , @xmath197 , @xmath198 ; and mssm - like values , which for definiteness we set @xmath199 , @xmath200 . in both cases",
    "we will take @xmath201 or @xmath202 , which correspond respectively to @xmath203 or @xmath204 .",
    "although the sm with these values of the parameters is not a realistic model , for the sake of comparison it is useful to consider such a kind of parameters besides those corresponding to the mssm , in order to simulate a different phase transition with the same simple form of the effective potential . regarding the mssm - like values , it is worthy to remind that our model eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) corresponds to the limit of only one light higgs boson of the mssm , and the values of the parameters correspond to the light right - handed stop scenario .",
    "the temperature @xmath205 at which nucleation of bubbles begins is defined as that at which the first bubble is formed inside a causal volume @xcite . in the radiation dominated era the horizon size scales like @xmath206 , where the age of the universe @xmath177 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ttrad ] ) .",
    "hence the size of a causal volume is @xmath207 , and the probability of nucleating a bubble inside it is @xmath208 where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ ttrad ] ) in the last step .",
    "the temperature @xmath205 is thus determined by the condition @xmath209 .",
    "this can be solved either by an analytical approximation @xcite or numerically , and gives @xmath210 although @xmath205 is often assumed to be the temperature of the transition , it only corresponds to the onset of nucleation , so it gives an upper bound for @xmath0 .",
    "once bubbles begin to nucleate , however , it still takes them some time to fill all space , since bubble walls can not move faster than light .",
    "a less conservative bound @xmath211 can thus be obtained by setting @xmath212 instead of using eq.([veloc ] ) for @xmath213 in eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) . in this limit",
    "the expansion of bubbles is so fast that we can neglect their initial radius @xmath72 .",
    "then the condition that the fraction @xmath214 falls to zero can be expressed as @xmath215 giving for the upper bound @xmath216 @xmath217 the small uncertainty is due to the variation of the parameters of the potential as we take sm - like or mssm - like values and the ratio @xmath218 in the range @xmath219",
    ".      it is easy to see from eqs .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) that the instanton action @xmath52 vanishes at @xmath10 .",
    "hence , there is no exponential suppression to the nucleation rate @xmath220 at that temperature ( this is a consequence of the disappearance of the barrier of @xmath100 at @xmath10 ) . at temperatures near",
    "the nucleation rate is thus @xmath221 , which is extremely large .",
    "indeed , @xmath222 means that in a time interval @xmath223 a bubble forms in every volume @xmath224 .",
    "this time @xmath118 is many orders of magnitude less than the time elapsed between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , eq .",
    "( [ dtc0 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the size of the nucleated bubbles is larger than the volume per bubble @xmath225 , since the radius of the electroweak bubble is always larger than a few @xmath226 .",
    "so all space must be filled with bubbles before the universe cools down to some temperature @xmath227 , when the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) is still much less than @xmath228 .",
    "we can calculate the lower bound @xmath229 by setting @xmath230 in eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) , @xmath231 this corresponds to the ( unrealistic ) limit of a nucleation - dominated first - order phase transition .",
    "the opposite limit is that of a bubble expansion dominated phase transition , in which the nucleated bubbles grow so rapidly that the original size is negligible , and the transition is completed when the nucleation rate is still small @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the upper bound @xmath232 we have just estimated .",
    "as we shall see , the electroweak phase transition is closer to an expansion dominated transition than to a nucleation dominated one .",
    "the temperature @xmath229 determined by eq .",
    "( [ eqtmin ] ) is given by @xmath233 .    in terms of the relative variable @xmath91 ,",
    "the bounds on the temperature of the transition are expressed as @xmath234 for sm values of @xmath23 and @xmath18 , and @xmath235 for mssm values of the parameters ( setting for definiteness @xmath236 in both cases ) .",
    "in the last section we have determined the temperatures @xmath232 and @xmath237 between which the phase transition takes place . depending on the value of the friction parameter @xmath142 , the temperature of the phase transition will be closer to one of these bounds .",
    "the fraction of space that is still in the symmetric phase is obtained by inserting eq .",

    "we have plotted @xmath239 in fig .",
    "[ figfrac ] for a given choice of parameters , in order to illustrate the evolution of the phase transition .",
    "note that , once the fraction of volume occupied by bubbles becomes appreciable , the phase transition completes in a tiny temperature interval .",
    "that is why we speak of the `` temperature of the transition '' rather than of a `` temperature interval '' .",
    "no relevant quantity will change appreciably in this interval .",
    "this is due to the large time - temperature relation , which governs the nucleation and expansion of bubbles .",
    "the duration of the phase transition varies very little with the friction .",

    "[ tteta ] .",
    "note that the dependence of @xmath242 with @xmath142 is almost logarithmic , so @xmath242 increases more slowly for large @xmath142 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath0 will be closer to @xmath232 rather than to @xmath237 for not extremely high values of @xmath142 . as discussed in section [ growth ]",

    "the temperature of the transition is given by @xmath245 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the variation in @xmath244 when considering different parameters of the effective potential , as explained in the previous section . since the ambiguity in @xmath246 produced by such a variation is of only a 5% , we believe that fig .",
    "[ s3teta ] not only describes qualitatively the general case , but it would also give a good approximation for the determination of the temperature of the electroweak phase transition within different models .",
    "the amount of baryon number generated at the electroweak phase transition depends on the shape of bubbles .",
    "we have seen that the relevant parameters , namely , the width and velocity of the bubble wall and the value of the higgs field in the broken symmetry phase , vary significantly between the temperatures @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and hence the importance of determining their values at the intermediate temperature @xmath0 at which the phase transition occurs .    regarding the wall velocity , we have shown in section [ growth ] that , although @xmath11 takes all the possible values @xmath247 in the interval @xmath248 , it changes rapidly at the beginning and at the end of that interval , but remains of the same order of magnitude for intermediate values of @xmath91 , roughly between @xmath249 and @xmath250 ( see fig .  [ vw ] ) .",
    "since the bounds on @xmath0 obtained in section [ temp ] fall in this region of slow variation of @xmath11 , we see that the wall velocity depends weakly on the actual temperature of the transition , although it is sensitive to the friction , as shown in fig .",
    "therefore , rough approximations of the temperature of the transition , such as the usual @xmath251 , do not introduce significant errors in the estimation of @xmath11 .",
    "the same can be said of the wall thickness , as inferred from fig .",

    ", the temperature of the transition stays close to the upper bound ( lower bound on @xmath242 ) , even for large values of @xmath142 .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ palfa ] ) to estimate by which amount the order parameter can change . setting for definiteness @xmath236 , like in fig .",

    "this means that the use of eq .",
    "( [ washout ] ) can result in an upper bound on the higgs mass that is by that percentage more severe than the correct constraint .",
    "a more precise bound for @xmath27 can be obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ lambdae ] ) recursively .",
    "for instance , after computing @xmath262 with the assumption @xmath236 and calculating the constraint @xmath263 , this new value of @xmath264 can be used to recalculate @xmath262 and obtain a higher order correction to the bound .",
    "this may be useful when considering a more concrete model for the phase transition .",
    "the error in the determination of @xmath265 diminishes considerably when using the temperature @xmath205 of the onset of nucleation instead of @xmath9 .",
    "for the values of the parameters that we have considered , @xmath12 increases by less than a 5% between @xmath266 and @xmath0 .",
    "hence , regarding the constraints that result by avoiding the washout of the baryon asymmetry , we again find that @xmath251 is a good approximation in the calculations of electroweak baryogenesis .    before concluding",
    ", we would like to discuss the behavior of another bubble parameter that is relevant for baryogenesis in the mssm , that is , the relative variation of the two higgs fields across the wall , @xmath267 .",
    "the @xmath2-violating force on the quarks depends on this variation , and thus the final baryon asymmetry results proportional to @xmath267 . in order to investigate the temperature dependence of this parameter , however , we would need to consider the full two - higgs model .",
    "the computation of the bubble profile with more than one scalar field is a difficult task ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , our results for the temperature of the transition can be used to verify the approximations employed in existing calculations of @xmath267 .",
    "moreno _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , for example , have calculated the higgs profile of the bubble in the light stop scenario .",
    "they performed the calculation at the temperature we have called @xmath205 , and also at @xmath268 and @xmath269 , and the variation they obtained of @xmath267 along the bubble wall is very similar among these temperatures .",
    "translating that temperature interval to the variable @xmath91 by @xmath270 , where @xmath271 and @xmath272 , gives @xmath273 .",
    "so the conclusion is that the parameter @xmath267 does not change significantly in an ample interval around @xmath274 , which , according to our results , includes the possible values of @xmath275 .",
    "it is well know that phase transition dynamics plays an important role in electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "although the production of the baryonic asymmetry of the universe at the electroweak phase transition is an exciting possibility , it is clear that a complete picture of the phase transition is needed to check quantitatively this possibility .",
    "this includes the detailed investigation of the evolution of bubbles , as well as the accurate calculation of the temperature of the transition . in this paper",
    "we have investigated both of this problems , which are certainly related with each other .",
    "we have determined the upper and lower temperature limits @xmath232 and @xmath237 inside the interval @xmath196 , between which the phase transition must take place regardless of the velocity of expansion of bubbles .",
    "our main conclusion in this respect is that , for the electroweak phase transition , the lower bound on @xmath0 avoids the possibility that the phase transition occurs at a temperature near @xmath10 .",
    "this is good for baryogenesis , since in such a case the transition would proceed by an almost homogeneous growing of the higgs field , what would lead to the generation of a smaller baryon abundance .",
    "when the evolution of the bubble wall is included , the temperature of the phase transition varies between the limits @xmath232 and @xmath229 as the friction parameter @xmath142 goes from @xmath38 to @xmath276 .",
    "however , it turns out that , due to the slow decreasing of temperature with time , the temperature @xmath0 stays close to @xmath232 for not extremely high values of @xmath142 . according to our numerical computations , for likely values of the viscosity of the plasma the temperature of the electroweak phase transition is given by @xmath277 .",
    "on the other hand , the values of the wall thickness @xmath278 and wall velocity @xmath279 are rather insensitive to temperature in the range @xmath280 , so they depend weakly on the actual temperature of the phase transition .",
    "regarding the higgs mean value @xmath281 , although baryogenesis is very sensitive to this parameter , and hence the uncertainty between @xmath229 and @xmath232 would still be considerable , the result that the phase transition takes place near @xmath232 eliminates this uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the temperature @xmath232 is in general close to that of the onset of nucleation .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 , which are relevant parameters for baryogenesis , do not change significantly from those obtained with the usual estimation of the temperature of the transition , i.e. , with the condition @xmath285 .",
    "we have also shown that the same applies to other quantities , which we have not computed , such as the parameter @xmath267 , which is relevant for electroweak baryogenesis in the context of the mssm .",
    "regarding further development of this analysis , a detailed investigation of the effect of reheating due to the latent heat released by the expanding bubbles would be necessary @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed in section [ temp ] , such an investigation would be especially important in the case of the mssm , where the main consequence of this effect would be to prevent the wall velocity to reach the value @xmath286 that is needed for a satisfactory result of electroweak baryogenesis .",
