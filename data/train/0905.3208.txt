    "the spin hall effect of light is the photonic version of the spin hall effect in electronic systems  @xcite , in which the spin photons play the role of the spin charges , and a refractive index gradient plays the role of the electric potential gradient  @xcite .",
    "such a spatial gradient for the refractive index could occur at an interface between two materials .",
    "the spin hall effect manifests itself as a spin - dependent shift of the beam centroid perpendicular to the refractive index gradient when photons passing through the interface . for left and right circularly polarized beams ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the transverse shift are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction .",
    "in fact , the translational inertial spin effect has been predicted by beauregard more than 40 years ago  @xcite .",
    "this effect is significantly different from longitudinal goos - hnchen shift  @xcite and transverse imbert - fedorov shift  @xcite in total internal reflection , which are described as evanescent - wave penetration .",
    "the splitting in the spin hall effect , implied by angular momentum conservation , takes place as a result of an effective spin - orbit interaction . in a glass - air interface ,",
    "the spin - dependent transverse shifts are just a few tens of nanometers .",
    "this is the reason why the tiny scale of the effect escaped detection for a long time .",
    "more recently , the spin hall effect has been detected in experiment via quantum weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "the recent advent of negative - refraction materials  @xcite , also known as left - handed materials ( lhms )  @xcite , not only opens a new way to generate the magnitude of refractive index gradient , but also provides an unprecedented reverse of the sign of refractive index at the interface of an ordinary right - handed material ( rhm ) and a lhm .",
    "it is now conceivable that lhms can be constructed whose permittivity and permeability values may be designed to vary independently and arbitrarily , taking negative or near - zero value as desired  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible for designing a certain refractive index gradient to modulate the spin hall effect .",
    "the potential interests encourage us to explore what would happen to the spin hall effect of light beam in the air - lhm interface . in the past several years",
    "many counterintuitive phenomena , such as anomalous evanescent - wave amplification  @xcite , unusual photon tunneling  @xcite , negative goos - hnchen shift  @xcite , reversed doppler effect  @xcite , and inverted cherenkov effect  @xcite in lhms have been reported .",
    "now a question naturally arise : whether is the the spin hall effect reversed as expected ?",
    "in addition , due to the different arguments on the direction of linear momentum in lhms  @xcite , the issue of how to describe photon momentum is still an open problem .",
    "hence our another motivation is to clarify whether the photon momentum is reversed in the lhm . in principle",
    ", the reflection and transmission from the air - lhm interface should fulfill the total momentum conservation law .",
    "we believe that the study of the spin hall effect may provide insights into the fundamental properties of photon momentum in the lhms .    in this work , we use an air - lhm interface as the refractive index gradient to explore what would happen to the spin hall effect of light beam .",
    "first , starting from the representation of a plane - wave angular spectrum , we establish a general beam propagation model to describe the beam reflection and transmission .",
    "next , we uncover how the beam evolves , and how the spin hall effect affects its transverse shifts .",
    "it is necessary to consider the spin hall effect in the presence of loss , since the loss is inherent to realizable lhms . for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we also study the spin hall effect in the air - rhm interface .",
    "then , we examine what roles the magnitude and the sign of the refractive index gradient play in the spin hall effect . finally , we explore whether the spin - dependent transverse shift or diffraction - dependent angular shift is reversed .",
    "the transverse shifts and the angular shifts , governed by the total momentum conservation law , provide us a new way to clarify the nature of photon momentum in the lhms .",
    "we begin to establish a general beam propagation model for describing light beam reflection and refraction from a planar air - lhm interface .",
