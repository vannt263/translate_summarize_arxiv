    "we explore the emergent band formation as we build lattices of varying structure , density and size .",
    "for all lattices studied , the bottom of the emerging band is found to shift towards lower energies , in accordance to the tight - binding model , as the lattice size or density is increased .",
    "furthermore , we find that the band onset saturates for larger structures , implying that the effect of finite size can be neglected . in the case of two - dimensional",
    "checkerboard- and stripe shaped lattices , we observe standing bloch waves .",
    "these patterns are well explained using a tight - binding model that includes coupling to the electron bath .",
    "surprisingly , the effective mass of the observed bloch waves is found to depend strongly on the lattice geometry .",
