    "five dimensional ( 5d ) warped extra dimensions provide a very attractive beyond the standard model physics scenario , since the standard model ( sm ) weak scale - planck scale hierarchy may be explained in a natural way  @xcite .",
    "the observed light quark and lepton masses , as well as the suppression of flavor violating operators is naturally satisfied provided the quark and gauge fields propagate in the bulk and the first and second generation quark wave functions are suppressed towards the so - called infrared brane ( ir brane ) , where the higgs is localized and where the natural scale of energies is of the order of the weak scale  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the propagation of gauge and fermion fields in the bulk leads to the mixing of zero - modes with kaluza klein ( kk ) modes , which induces important tree - level effects on precision electroweak observables  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this happens specially for gauge bosons and third generation quarks  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the latter tend to be localized close to the ir brane in order to generate the large top - quark mass .",
    "the introduction of a custodial @xmath5 symmetry together with a discrete left - right symmetry leads to reduced corrections to the @xmath6 parameter  @xcite,@xcite and helps protect the bottom - quark coupling to the z gauge boson against large tree - level corrections .",
    "the top - bottom doublet may then be embedded in a bidoublet of the @xmath7 group .",
    "still , important corrections to the precision electroweak observables subsist at the one loop - level , and agreement with data for kk masses at the reach of the lhc may only be obtained in a certain region of fermion mass bulk parameters of the third generation quarks  @xcite,@xcite .    the above requirements may be satisfied in a natural way by embedding the standard model gauge @xmath8 group and the global custodial @xmath5 group into an @xmath9 gauge symmetry group  @xcite",
    ". the @xmath9 symmetry is broken by boundary conditions at the ir brane down to @xmath10 and to @xmath11 at the ultraviolet brane ( uv brane ) .",
    "the five dimensional components of the gauge bosons associated with the broken gauge symmetries at the ir brane have the proper quantum numbers of the higgs doublet , leading to a natural implementation of the gauge - higgs unification mechanism  @xcite@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the coleman - weinberg potential for the higgs field was studied and its dependence on the five dimensional mass parameters was determined . it was shown that the region of parameters consistent with precision electroweak observables is in good agreement with that required to obtain the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry , with the proper values of the top - quark , bottom - quark and weak gauge boson masses .",
    "one of the most important properties of these type of models is the existence of light excited states of the top quark .",
    "these quarks are strongly coupled to the gauge bosons kk modes which are localized towards the ir brane and are light enough so that the first kk mode of the gluon , @xmath4 , tends to decay into them .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a reduced decay branching ratio of @xmath4 into top - quarks .",
    "these properties , together with an increase in the width of @xmath4 make the @xmath4 detection via decay into top quarks more challenging than in the models which have been previously analyzed in the literature  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , for positive values of the bulk mass parameter associated with the multiplet of the left - handed top - bottom doublet which is preferred by flavor constraints  @xcite , the couplings of the left- and right - handed top quarks to @xmath4 become close to each other , leading to a reduced left - right top - quark production asymmetry . a similar effect will be present in the lhc phenomenology of the weak gauge bosons kk modes  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall concentrate on the production of the first excited state of the top quark @xmath3 , at the lhc .",
    "we shall first show how to consistently determine the couplings of the quarks to gauge bosons in a functional way .",
    "these couplings will then be used to compute the decay widths and production cross section of the first top quark and gluon kk modes .",
    "we shall show that the presence of @xmath4 leads to an important enhancement of the @xmath3 production cross section for masses beyond the ones that can be tested via direct qcd production  @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is very important , since agreement with precision electroweak observables tends to be obtained for @xmath3 masses larger than 1  tev , for which detection of @xmath3 via qcd production becomes very difficult .",
    "we shall also show that for large @xmath3-masses the branching ratios for the decay of @xmath3 into a @xmath12 and a bottom - quark , a @xmath1 and a top - quark , and a top - quark and higgs boson , are in an approximate 2:1:1 relation , as required by the goldstone equivalence theorem .",
    "moreover , we will show that the technique of massive jets  @xcite,@xcite becomes very important for the reconstruction of the @xmath3 modes .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our 5-dimensional model .",
    "the mass spectrum and other relevant parameters of our model consistent with low energy data were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 3 and 4",
    "we will analyze how to obtain the properly normalized wave functions for the gauge fields and the fermions , respectively . in section 5",
    "we derive the various couplings necessary to study the collider phenomenology for this model and we numerically study the dependence of the calculated couplings on the parameters of our model , as well as the decay branching ratios . in section 6",
    "we discuss the collider phenomenology .",
    "we reserve section 7 for our conclusions .",
    "we are interested in a 5d gauge theory with gauge group @xmath2 .",
    "the geometry of our space - time will be that of rs1  @xcite , with an orbifolded extra spatial dimension in the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the metric for such a geometry is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
    "the space spanning the fifth dimension corresponds to a slice of , with branes attached at the two boundary points : @xmath16 ( uv brane ) and @xmath17 ( ir brane ) .",
    "we place our gauge fields , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in the bulk , where @xmath20 are the hermitian generators of the fundamental representation of @xmath21 and generically @xmath22=c(5)\\delta^{\\alpha,\\beta}$ ] .",
    "the explicit form of the generators  @xcite are given in appendix a. our fermions @xmath23 also live in the bulk , and they transform under a representation @xmath24 of @xmath21 .",
    "the 5d action is @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the 5d dimensionful gauge couplings .",
    "the choice @xmath29 is a convenient choice , since it allows us to identify the eigenvalues of our generators as the weak isospin , with the four dimensional coupling given by @xmath30 .",
    "any other choice for @xmath31 may be absorbed into a redefinition of the gauge fields or the gauge coupling leaving the physics unchanged .    to construct a realistic 4d low energy theory",
    ", we will break the 5d @xmath9 gauge symmetry down to the subgroup @xmath32 on the ir brane and to @xmath33 on the uv brane , where @xmath34 is the hypercharge and @xmath35 is the @xmath36 associated charge which is accommodated to obtain the correct hypercharge .",
    "we divide the generators of @xmath21 as follows : the generators of @xmath37 are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while the generators from the coset @xmath40 are denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in order to obtain the correct hypercharge and therefore the right weinberg angle @xmath43 , we need to rotate the fields @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xcite , @xmath46 @xmath47 the correct weinberg angle is then given by @xmath48 .",
    "we will enforce @xmath49 to have even parity , corresponding to the hypercharge gauge boson in the 4d low energy limit . from now on we will drop the prime on @xmath50 , and it will be understood that @xmath51 refers to @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    to implement the breaking of @xmath21 on the two branes as stated above , we impose the following boundary conditions on the gauge fields :    @xmath54    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this set of boundary conditions on the gauge fields leads to the identification of @xmath55 as the higgs field with a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) .",
    "we concentrate on the third generation fermions which are the most important for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) considerations .",
    "the sm fermions are embedded in full representations of the bulk gauge group as discussed in  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we therefore introduce in the quark sector three @xmath21 multiplets per generation as follows : @xmath56 @xmath57 where we show the decomposition under @xmath58 , and explicitly write the @xmath59 charges .",
    "the @xmath60s are bidoublets of @xmath58 , with @xmath61 acting vertically and @xmath5 acting horizontally .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 transform as @xmath64 and @xmath65 under @xmath58 , respectively , while @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath58 singlets .",
    "as was done in  @xcite we introduce mass mixing boundary terms , @xmath68 ~ , \\label{localizedmasses}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are dimensionless masses .",
    "since the higgs mixes , amongst other terms , doublets with singlets , we see that with the current parity assignments for the singlet component of the first multiplet , we would in principle not have positive parity for this coupling at the ir brane . however , as discussed in  @xcite , the switch in the singlet parity to @xmath71 is completely equivalent to taking @xmath72 .",
    "we also show the parities on the indicated 4d chirality , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 stands for odd and even parity conditions and the first and second entries in the bracket correspond to the parities in the uv and ir branes respectively .",
    "let us stress that while odd parity is equivalent to a dirichlet boundary condition , the even parity is a linear combination of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , that is determined via the fermion bulk equations of motion .",
    "the boundary conditions for the opposite chirality fermion multiplet can be read off the ones above by a flip in both chirality and boundary condition , @xmath75 for example . in the absence of mixing among multiplets satisfying different boundary conditions ,",
    "the sm fermions arise as the zero - modes of the fields obeying @xmath71 boundary conditions .",
    "the remaining boundary conditions are chosen so that @xmath76 is preserved on the ir brane and so that mass mixing terms , necessary to obtain the sm fermion masses after electroweak symmetry breaking , can be written on the ir brane .",
    "consistency of the above parity assignments with the original orbifold @xmath77 symmetry at the ir brane was discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "solving the equations of motion in the presence of the higgs vev .",

    "all points between the upper and lower blue and red lines have a cross section larger than 30  fb and 15  fb , respectively .",

    ", the @xmath3 tends to be strongly coupled to the first gluon excitation @xmath4 and sufficiently light , so that it can be produced from decays of @xmath4 .",

    ". instead , as recently emphasized in the literature , it is convenient to apply the technique of massive jets , that becomes essential for an efficient reconstruction of the @xmath3 states in our case .",
    "our analysis shows that the increase in the production cross section of @xmath3 pairs , induced by the presence of @xmath4 s in the class of models under analysis , extends the reach of the @xmath3 searches to masses not accessible via direct qcd production .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 masses , and we obtain that for a value of @xmath234 of about 4  tev and with a high lhc luminosity of about 300 @xmath290 , the first kk excitation of the top quark with a mass of 1.5  tev may be detected .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath3 in this mass range , possible due to an increase in its production cross section , may point towards the presence of a heavy gauge boson resonance contributing to the @xmath3 production rate .",

    "<S> we compute the couplings of the zero modes and first excited states of gluons , @xmath0 s , @xmath1 gauge bosons , as well as the higgs , to the zero modes and first excited states of the third generation quarks , in an rs gauge - higgs unification scenario based on a bulk @xmath2 gauge symmetry , with gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk . using the parameter space consistent with electroweak precision tests and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , we study numerically the dependence of these couplings on the parameters of our model . furthermore , after emphasizing the presence of light excited states of the top quark , which couple strongly to the kaluza klein gauge bosons , the associated collider phenomenology is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we concentrate on the possible detection of the first excited state of the top , @xmath3 , which tends to have a higher mass than the ones accessible via regular qcd production processes . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the detection of these particles is still possible due to an increase in the pair production of @xmath3 induced by the first excited state of the gluon , @xmath4 . </S>"
