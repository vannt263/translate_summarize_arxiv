    "the hamiltonian for a central unpaired electron spin coupled with a nuclear spin bath is written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "the presently available theories for the central spin problem usually resort to the perturbation approach , based on certain approximations , e.g. the quasi - static approximation or the limit of large magnetic fields and/or large spin bath polarizations . for our present purpose ,",
    "these approximations are only of limited use since , in the radical pair mechanism , one is particularly interested in the region of low fields , and the number of most relevant surrounding nuclei is @xmath99 10 , in contrast with @xmath100 in quantum dots .",

    "the agreement between them is good ( even though not perfect ) .",

    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a chemical compass model for migratory birds , based on such a mechanism @xcite has been widely studied . </S>",
    "<S> evidence suggests that the rpm is indeed linked to the avian magnetoreception @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently demonstrated in spin chemistry experiments that a photochemical reaction can act as a compass even in a magnetic field as weak as the geomagnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism in such a chemical compass is clearly of quantum mechanical nature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the detailed role of quantum interactions , in giving rise to entanglement and coherence , are little understood @xcite . on the other hand , one can observe growing interest in the role of quantum coherence for biological processes in general @xcite , and specifically in photosynthesis @xcite . a deeper understanding of the role of quantum mechanics in biology will eventually come along with the ability to control biological processes at the level of individual molecules . in physics , </S>",
    "<S> various kinds of quantum control techniques have been developed , specifically in the field of quantum information processing and quantum metrology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question thus naturally arises to what extent these or similar techniques could be applied to test and refine certain biophysical hypotheses , such as the chemical compass model for animal magnetoreception ? </S>",
    "<S> can we use quantum technologies that have primarily been developed to control man - made microscopic systems , to study the behavior of living things  e.g. birds , fruit flies , or plants  in a detectable way ?    in our work , </S>",
    "<S> aiming at the above questions , we will revisit the rpm and the chemical compass model using concepts and techniques from quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> the rpm can serve both as a magnetometer or as a compass , depending on the molecular realization . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we will refer to both cases as `` compass '' in the following . </S>",
    "<S> first , we demonstrate that quantum control ideas can be applied to experiments in spin chemistry and potentially also to study the magnetoreception of certain animals . </S>",
    "<S> we propose several quantum control protocols that can be used to either enhance or suppress the function of a chemical compass . assuming that the model provides the correct explanation for magnetoreception of certain species , we predict that they would loose or regain their orientability in appropriately designed experiments using such quantum control protocols  given that such experiments could be carried out safely . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the rpm can not only detect weak magnetic fields , but it is also sensitive to quantum control even without the presence of a static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these results offer a new means to study experimentally the rpm , also in comparison with other conceivable mechanisms such as those in man - made magnetometers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we investigate whether entanglement is a necessary ingredient in animal magneto - reception , which seems appealing in the light of the important role this concept has gained in fundamental discussions on quantum mechanics and its wider implications . as the sensitivity of the chemical compass depends on the initial state of the radical pair , it is natural to ask whether it needs to be quantum mechanically entangled  thereby excluding any conceivable classical mechanism  or whether classical correlations would be sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the answer largely depends on the radical pair lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> for specific realizations of the rpm , e.g. those in recent spin - chemistry experiments @xcite , entanglement features prominently and can even serve as a signature of the underlying spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the radical pair lifetime is extremely long , as it is believed to be the case in the molecular candidate for magneto reception in european robins @xcite , entanglement does not seem to play a significant role .    </S>",
    "<S> _ radical pair mechanism. _ we consider a photochemical reaction that starts from the light activation of a photoreceptor , followed by an electron transfer process ; two unpaired electrons in a spin - correlated electronic singlet state are then carried by a radical pair . </S>",
    "<S> the effective environment of a radical pair mainly consists of their individual surrounding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of a radical pair is of the form @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath2 denote the hyperfine coupling tensors and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the electron and nuclear spin operators respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of a radical pair is assumed to be the singlet state @xmath5 , which subsequently suffers from de - coherence through the hyperfine interactions with the environmental nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the nuclear spins at room temperature can be approximated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dimension of the @xmath8th nuclear spin . </S>",
    "<S> the charge recombination of the radical pair goes through different channels , depending on the electron - spin state ( singlet or triplet ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the yield of products formed by the reaction of singlet radical pairs can be calculated as @xcite @xmath9where @xmath10 is the radical re - encounter probability distribution , and @xmath11 is the fidelity between the electron spin state @xmath12 at time @xmath13 and the singlet state . the ultimate activation yield @xmath14 in cryptochrome is believed to affect the visual function of animals @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have followed the established theory for the dynamics of the rpm @xcite and computed the full quantum dynamics of the combined system of electron spins and nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> technically , we employ the chebyshev polynomial expansion method @xcite to numerically calculate the exact evolution operator @xmath15 , and thereby all relevant physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the well - studied photochemical reaction of pyrene ( py-@xmath16 ) and n , n - dimethylaniline ( dma-@xmath17 ) @xcite , for which the hyperfine couplings are isotropic @xcite , and the tensor @xmath2 in ( [ hamil ] ) simplifies to a number @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the role of entanglement in this radical pair reaction and propose new experiments based on quantum control . </S>",
    "<S> we then generalize our results to the cryptochrome radical pair of fadh@xmath19-o@xmath20 , which is the molecular candidate believed to be involved in avian magnetoreception @xcite . </S>",
