    "the theory of the neutrino - pair radiation from nucleons in the @xmath2- condensed nucleon matter of neutron stars was developed in voskresensky under the basic simplification that the amplitude of the pion field is small with respect to the pion mass , @xmath3 , so that the nucleon - pion interaction may be considered as a perturbation , and the matrix element of the reaction is given by the following diagrams ,    where the wavy line represents the external field of the pion condensate , and the initial and final nucleon states are the plane waves .",
    "the conclusion has been made that the corresponding neutrino energy losses depend on temperature as @xmath4 .",
    "what we demonstrate in this letter is that the above result is valid only in the more strong limit , @xmath5 , which is never fulfilled in the case of developed condensate field . in the more realistic case , @xmath6",
    ", the process is suppressed exponentially .",
    "the physical reason for this is a periodic structure of the developed pion condensate .",
    "the repeated interactions of a nucleon with the periodic pion field modify the nucleon spectrum , which is split into two bands , and the energy gap between the bands is about a few @xmath7 or larger , even if the amplitude of the pion field is small compared with the pion mass .",
    "consequently , at temperatures less than a few @xmath0 , at which the above reactions has been thought to be important , the efficiency of the process is much less than previously estimated .",
    "the analogous mechanism of suppression of the neutrino - pair radiation was considered for the electron bremsstrahlung in the crystalline crust of the neutron star @xcite , and for neutrino emission from the bubble phase of the stellar nuclear matter @xcite .    in",
    "the following we use the system of units @xmath8 .",
    "by assuming a pseudovector nucleon interaction with the pion field @xmath9 the effective nucleon hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10where the spin , @xmath11 , and isospin , @xmath12 , operators are given by the pauli matrices ; @xmath13 is the effective nucleon mass ; and @xmath14 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant .    to examine the nucleon spectrum in the presence of the @xmath2 condensate ,",
    "let us consider a simple model with the condensed classical pion field @xmath15 of the form of a standing wave @xcite @xmath16with a real amplitude @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 in this case we have@xmath19with@xmath20thus the nucleon quasi - particle moves in the three - dimensional periodic potential@xmath21which can be recast as the sum over reciprocal lattice vectors@xmath22here",
    "@xmath23 for protons and neutrons respectively .",
    "the matrix element @xmath24is given by the integral over the volume of the elementary cell@xmath25one can easily find that there are only six non - zero reciprocal lattice vectors for which the matrix element does not vanish , @xmath26 .",
    "the direct calculation yields@xmath27where the unit vector @xmath28 has the following components @xmath29thus we can write@xmath30where @xmath31    by assuming that the periodic potential @xmath32 is small with respect to the nucleon energy , near the fermi surface , the nucleons can be considered as almost free quasi - particles of the effective mass @xmath33",
    ". then the crystal potential has the most effect on the nucleon states for which the free particle energies @xmath34 and @xmath35 are almost equal for some reciprocal lattice vector @xmath36 , or , equivalentely , if the component of the quasi - particle momentum in the direction of the reciprocal lattice vector is close to @xmath37 .",
    "the latter condition means that , in the above approximation , the summation over reciprocal lattice vectors can be restricted by the values @xmath38 typically the pion condensation appears at @xmath39 , and the condition ( [ kmax ] ) means the summation over all of the six reciprocal lattice vectors as given by eq .",
    ".    at @xmath40 one has @xmath41 . in this case , up to the leading terms , the equation of motion of the nucleon has the form@xmath42 \\psi = 0,\\]]and the nucleon wave function can be written as a superposition of two plane waves@xmath43 , \\]]where the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 obey the following set of equations@xmath46@xmath47@xmath48which has a non - trivial solution if @xmath49as it follows from this dispersion equation , the energy eigenvalues , are devided into two bands , @xmath50shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the upper and the lower band are denoted as @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",

    "the spectrum of the corresponding nucleon states is of the band - like structure similar to that for electrons in a cristalline metal . as given by eq .",
    "( [ epm ] ) , the energy gap in the nucleon spectrum is @xmath60 . as will be shown in the next section , even in the case of a small amplitude of the pion field , @xmath61 , the energy gap , @xmath62 ,",
    "exponentially suppresses the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung from the nucleons , and the neutrino energy losses in this process are much less than estimated before in @xcite .",
    "when , in the nucleon wave functions , the condensed pion field is  exactly  taken into account the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung@xmath63 can be described by the following diagram ,    where the lepton pair is radiated by the nucleon undergoing a transition between its eigen - states in the pion field .",
    "if the initial and final nucleon states are in the same band , the radiation is kinematically forbidden .",
    "indeed , in this case the four - momentum @xmath64 transferred from the nucleon is space - like , the energy difference between nucleon states @xmath65 is less than @xmath66 .",
    "] , @xmath67 , while the total momentum of the lepton pair is a time - like , @xmath68 .",
    "consequently it is impossible simultaneously to conserve the energy and momentum in the reaction .",
    "however , even for small momentum transfers , there exists a finite energy difference between different bands , so the neutrino radiation is kinematically allowed for the nucleon transitions shown by the arrow in fig . 1 .",
    "we now examine the process in which the neutron quasi - particle @xmath69 makes a transition from the upper band to the lower one . the neutrino interaction with the non - relativistic neutrons",
    "is of the form@xmath70where @xmath71 is the fermi constant , and @xmath72 .",
    "the vector current of the non - relativistic neutron has only the time component , @xmath73 , while the axial - vector current is given by its space components , @xmath74 .",
    "the neutral weak current of neutrinos is of the standard form @xmath75we consider the total energy which is emitted into neutrino pairs per unit volume and time . by fermi s  golden  rule we have@xmath76the integration goes over the phase volume of neutrinos and antineutrinos of total energy @xmath77 and total momentum @xmath78 .",
    "the symbol @xmath79  indicates that summation over the three neutrino types has to be performed .",
    "the square of the matrix element of the reaction ( [ br ] ) summed over spins of initial and final particles has the following form@xmath80here we take into account that , in the degenerate case @xmath81 , one can neglect a small momentum of the neutrino par , @xmath82 , by making the following replacement @xmath83 .",
    "the distribution function of initial nucleon as well as blocking of its final states are taken into account by the pauli blocking - factor @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the fermi distribution function@xmath86we assume that neutrinos can escape freely from the matter .    by inserting @xmath87 in this equation , and making use of the lenard s integral   @xmath88where",
    "@xmath89 is the heaviside step function , we can write@xmath90then the direct calculation of the integrals gives @xmath91here the lower limit of integration corresponds to the minimal energy of the neutrino pair radiated due to the nucleon transition from the upper to the lower band .    according to eq .",
    "( [ uk ] ) , there are only six non - zero reciprocal lattice vectors for which the matrix element @xmath92 does not vanish . by performing summation over reciprocal lattice vectors and taking into account three neutrino flavours , @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 the energy gap @xmath95between the nucleon energy bands rapidly increases along with increasing of the amplitude of the condensed pion field . for a developed condensate one",
    "has @xmath96 in this low - temperature limit , typical for neutron stars , the neutrino energy losses are exponentially suppressed .",
    "indeed , in the case @xmath97 , the main contribution to the integral , in eq . ( [ q ] ) , comes from the vicinity of the lower limit where @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , in the case of developed pion condensate , we obtain the following estimate @xmath99    in the limiting case of small amplitude of the pion field @xmath100 , from eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) we have@xmath101which reproduces the result obtained in @xcite by the perturbation theory .",
    "notice that the energy losses ( [ qpert ] ) are actually 3 times larger than that given in @xcite due to summation over 3 neutrino flavours .",
    "to summarize , neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung from nucleons in the periodic field of the @xmath102 condensate is much less important than suggested by earlier estimates .",
    "the reason for this is that , at the temperatures typical for cooling neutron stars , the process is suppressed by band structure effects ."
