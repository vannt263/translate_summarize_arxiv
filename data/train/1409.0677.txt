    "rotating neutron stars may experience a host of non - axisymmetric instabilities , acting either on a dynamical or secular ( e.g. associated with some dissipation mechanism ) timescale .",
    "it is important to understand the range of possible instabilities , whether they are likely to act in a realistic astrophysical setting and possible repercussions on the evolution of the star .",
    "the most pressing issues have a direct connection with observations .",
    "in particular , because the unstable oscillation modes are non - axisymmetric they generate gravitational radiation and a number of plausible scenarios where this radiation may be detectable by advanced interferometers have been suggested .",
    "presently , the most interesting scenarios involve dynamical instabilities triggered during the late stages of core - collapse or in the immediate aftermath of binary merger and gravitational - wave driven instabilities of more mature stars ( associated with either the star s fundamental f - mode or the inertial r - mode ) .",
    "the main topic of the present work , the so - called low t / w instability , is a relative late - comer to the discussion . just like its classic cousins the dynamical bar - mode instability and the secular instabilities due to viscosity or gravitational radiation , this instability acts on the f - mode of the star .",
    "the main distinction is that the low t / w instability requires the star to be differentially rotating . the aim of this paper is to explore , in more detail than in previous work , the nature of this instability .",
    "in particular , we want to test the assertion that the instability becomes active as soon as the f - mode enters the co - rotation region ( whenever there exists a point in the star where the mode appears stationary with respect to an inertial observer ) .",
    "the study of instabilities of rotating stars has a long history .",
    "work on newtonian incompressible self - graviting rotating ellipsoids , like the maclaurin spheroids , provided the first instability criteria in terms of the parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the kinetic and gravitational energy of the star ( note that we will often omit the absolute values in referring to the low t / w instability in the text ) .",
    "early work established that the dynamical bar - mode instability sets in when a star reaches @xmath4  @xcite . for higher spins than this , a star can reach a new equilibrium configuration with lower energy , maintaining the same mass , volume and angular momentum .",
    "the instability is dynamical because it does not require any additional mechanisms , like internal viscosity or the coupling to radiation , to operate .",
    "although the models that were considered early on were simplistic the results have been found to be robust .",
    "recent relativistic numerical simulations of rotating stars with both polytropic and more realistic equation of state ( eos ) have only adjusted this instability threshold slightly to @xmath5  @xcite . however",
    ", this level of rotation can not be achieved by a compressible star in uniform rotation , since the corresponding mass shedding limit is reached for @xmath6 . to reach higher values of @xmath7",
    "the system must rotate differentially . however , it is still not clear that astrophysical systems will ever reach such large values of @xmath7 , at least not for a sustained period ( there is evidence of significant differential rotation being generated during core collapse but this phase is interrupted by the core bounce so any related instability do not have much time to grow ) .",
    "the introduction of differential rotation brings new features to the problem .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations led to the discovery that stars with a higher degree of differential rotation can suffer dynamical instabilities even at much lower values , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the existence of this instability , now referred to as the low t / w instability , has been confirmed by a number of full 3d numerical simulations as well as in linear analyses . in some cases , the instability threshold has been shown to be as low as @xmath9  @xcite . despite these interesting results",
    ", we do not yet have a detailed understanding of the nature of this instability .",
    "it has been proposed that the instability originates from an energy transfer between the bulk motion and an oscillation mode  @xcite , in a fashion that resembles the shear instability in thick accretion disks ( the so - called papaloizou - pringle instability )  @xcite .",
    "one would expect this energy exchange to occur at the co - rotation point , where the pattern speed of a mode matches the local angular velocity of the star ( see discussion later ) .",
    "in analogy with accretion disks it was suggested that the star s vortensity may indicate the resonant cavity where this instability can grow  @xcite .",
    "however , for rotating stars this criterion does not seem completely satisfactory ( at least this has not been demonstrated yet ) .",
    "the low t / w instability has been studied in newtonian and relativistic non - linear simulations , with different methods and distinct numerical codes .",
    "there is clear evidence that it may develop during stellar core - collapse   and it has been seen in numerical evolutions of rapidly rotating cold neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "recently , with the development of magneto - hydrodynamical simulations , the impact of the magnetic field on the dynamical instabilities has been explored  @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the bar - mode instability can be suppressed by a very strong magnetic field , @xmath10 g .",
    "analytical work , based on a rotating system with cylindrical geometry , has shown that the low t / w instability can be similarly suppressed by a strong toroidal magnetic field @xmath11",
    "g  @xcite . numerical simulations that consider an initial poloidal seed magnetic field , which differential rotation subsequently winds up , have shown that the instability is not affected for poloidal fields @xmath12 g .",
    "more interestingly , for @xmath13 g a quadrupolar distortion may be amplified by magnetic effects  @xcite .",
    "much more effort is required in order to explore the interplay between differential rotation , the star s magnetic field and various instabilities .    in this work we focus on the pure hydrodynamics problem ; we ignore magnetic fields , the star s elastic crust , superfluid core etcetera .",
    "we study the low t / w instability by means of time - evolutions of the linearised newtonian equations .",
    "we focus on stars with a polytropic eos and assume that the differential rotation is given by the j - constant rotation law .",
    "the latter choice is motivated by simulations of both core - collapse and neutron star mergers that suggest that real systems stay rather close to this simple rotation law .",
    "our main aim is to determine the instability growth time for varying degrees of differential rotation and connect the results with key features like the presence of a co - rotation point in the star .",
    "the analysis focuses on the @xmath0 f - mode ( the bar - mode ) , which in general exhibits the strongest instability .",
    "we trace the instability as the degree of differential rotation is increased for a given star , monitoring key indicators like the canonical energy and angular momentum densities .",
    "this part of the analysis builds on the work of @xcite , who considered the canonical angular momentum associated with the unstable mode for cylindrical stars , and showed that even though the canonical angular momentum grows due to the instability it remains zero at the co - rotation point . to speed up the numerical simulations and allow us to investigate a large parameter space we mainly use the cowling approximation , i.e. we neglect the perturbation of the gravitational potential .",
    "this affects the mode - frequencies at the 20% level , which should not have significant influence on the qualitative behaviour that is our main focus .",
    "as we are considering the problem of a differentially rotating star in newtonian gravity , we need to solve the euler equation , the continuity equation for mass conservation and the poisson equation for the gravitational potential : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant . in these equations ,",
    "the scalar fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent , respectively , the mass density , the specific enthalpy and the gravitational potential , while @xmath18 is the fluid velocity .    to close the system of equations we need to provide an equation of state . in order to keep things simple , which makes sense",
    "as we are mainly interested in qualitative features , we consider a polytropic model ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant and the adiabatic index is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the polytropic index .    for an axisymmetric equilibrium configuration , equations  ( [ eq : dvdt])-([eq : dphi ] ) can be written in integral form  @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an integration constant , and the gravitational potential is determined by the integral equation : @xmath25 in equation ( [ eq : bgmu_x ] ) , the centrifugal potential @xmath26 is defined by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the star s angular velocity and the cylindrical radius @xmath29 represents the distance of a fluid element from the rotation axis . in a barotropic fluid ,",
    "pressure and enthalpy are related by @xmath30 which for a polytropic eos leads to : @xmath31      in order to explore the unstable oscillations associated with the low t / w instability we need to solve the equations that govern linear perturbations of our differentially rotating configurations .",
    "quite generally , non - axisymmetric small - amplitude oscillations of a differentially rotating star can be studied with a set of three scalar and one vector perturbation fields , namely the mass density @xmath32 , the enthalpy @xmath33 , the gravitational potential @xmath34 and the velocity perturbation @xmath35 .",

    "if the low t / w instability is the result of an energy exchange between a co - rotating mode and the fluid bulk flow , this should be reflected in the energy and angular momentum integrands , .",
    "this behaviour was , in fact , observed for the canonical angular momentum by  @xcite , who showed that the @xmath120 integrand grows when an instability is present while remaining zero at the co - rotation point .    to study the behaviour of @xmath121 and @xmath122 it is useful to determine the cylindrical radius , @xmath123 , at which a given mode co - rotates with the star ( where @xmath124 ) .",
    "for the j - constant rotation law , we can determine from equation  ( [ eq : jlaw ] ) and the mode frequency , @xmath125 , the following expression for the co - rotation point : @xmath126    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ec ] we show the canonical energy distribution inside the star and the co - rotation radius @xmath123 calculated from equation  ( [ eq : wc ] ) , for a selection of unstable models with @xmath111 .",
    "as expected , @xmath121 grows around the co - rotation point and vanishes at @xmath123 .",
    "the same feature has been observed for the canonical angular momentum .",
    "these results confirm that the growth time extracted from our numerical simulations is associated with the @xmath0 f - mode ( as expected ) .",
    "the dependence of the instability growth time on the position of the co - rotation point is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : cor - a ] . in order to understand the behaviour better",
    ", we consider the variation of @xmath118 with the degree of differential rotation and try to relate the results with the stellar parameters .",
    "typical results are provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : taua ] , where we show the variation of the unstable mode s imaginary part , @xmath127 , with respect to the rotation parameter @xmath7 ( left - hand panel ) and cylindrical co - rotation radius ( right - hand panel ) for stars with @xmath67 ranging between 0.1 and 0.6 .",
    "note that @xmath128 corresponds to the the condition @xmath129 , while @xmath130 implies that @xmath131 .",
    "along each rotating sequence , corresponding to a specific @xmath67 , @xmath132 exhibits a maximum inside the co - rotation band and decays towards the boundaries of the region .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for higher differential rotation the instability region appears at smaller rotation rates .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : taua ] make qualitative sense given our expectations for the low t / w instability , but we would obviously like to understand the detailed features better .",
    "there are two main aspects to this .",
    "first of all , the maximum @xmath132 is not centred in the middle of the co - rotation band , where @xmath133 .",
    "secondly , @xmath132 appears to reach its largest absolute value in the @xmath134 model .",
    "if the shear instability depends on an energy exchange between the bulk motion and the co - rotating mode , one would expect the instability timescale to depend on the energy and degree of differential rotation present at the co - rotation point .",
    "considering the behaviour of the variables involved , we find that the function ; @xmath135 where the derivative of the star s angular velocity is calculated at the co - rotation radius , has a maximum at the same point as @xmath132 along the stellar sequence . actually , we find that @xmath136 increases from @xmath98 to 0.5 and then decreases .",
    "hence , the function @xmath136 accounts reasonably well for the main features observed in our results , eg",
    ". the faster instability growth of the model with @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , for each rotating model ( with a given @xmath67 ) the function @xmath136 can be used to determine the position of the shortest growth time inside the instability region .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath136 can be re - written in terms of the star s parameters and the mode s pattern speed , using equation  ( [ eq : wc ] ) , @xmath138 our numerical data suggest that @xmath132 is reasonably well approximated by the following empirical relation ; @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a constant , and @xmath67 is the usual differential rotation parameter . for the various models considered in this work the function @xmath141",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psia ] , while the corresponding ( dimensionless ) values of @xmath140 are given in table  [ tab : psia ] .",
    "the maximum and the behaviour at small co - rotation radii are well captured by @xmath141 , there is a slight horizontal offset for @xmath142 and 0.6 but they only amount to 1 - 2 % with respect to the @xmath132 peak . for larger @xmath123 ,",
    "the function @xmath141 generally assumes slightly larger values than @xmath132 , while for @xmath98 the opposite is the case . for the latter model",
    ", this behaviour could be due to the presence of other unstable modes , but we did not manage to resolve this issue with our simulations .    considering the explorative approach adopted in our investigation , it is interesting to note how well the function @xmath141 captures the main properties of the instability growth time and how it identifies the model with the strongest instability along a sequence .",
    "this provides interesting pointers towards future work .",
    "first of all , one should investigate if our empirical expression remains useful also for other models , eg .",
    "different polytropic indices and rotational laws .",
    "if the suggestion proves robust one should also try to understand the underlying physics .",
    "this might shed useful light on the nature of this class of instabilities .    before moving on ,",
    "let us point out that most of the numerical results have been presented in dimensionless units , and the shortest growth time calculated in this work is @xmath143 for a model with @xmath134 and axis ratio @xmath144 .",
    "in physical units , this value is @xmath145  ms , for a typical star with @xmath146 and eos parameters @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    ".[tab : psia ] the dimensionless values of the coefficient @xmath140 , see equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) , for stellar models with @xmath149 . [",

    "they are , respectively , @xmath150 and 0.6 ( see legend ) .",
    "the dashed line denotes the equatorial boundary of the co - rotation region .",
    "the horizontal axis displays the quantity @xmath151 while the vertical axis gives the ratio between the mode frequency and the central angular velocity of the star .",
    "this figure can be directly compared to fig .",
    "4 of @xcite , where the numerical method became unreliable as the mode approached the co - rotation region .",
    "[ fig : r - mode],height=309 ]",
    "the perturbative time - evolution code obviously allows us to consider a wider range of problems involving differentially rotating stars . as a pertinent example , let us make some comments on the inertial r - modes .",
    "these modes are rotationally restored by the coriolis force and are of particular interest since they suffer the gravitational - wave instability already at low rotation rates in uniform stars .",
    "much effort has gone into understanding the astrophysical relevance of this instability , eg .",
    "the role of various internal viscosity mechanisms , but the bulk of the work has considered stars in uniform rotation .",
    "if the r - mode instability acts very early on in a neutron star s life or is triggered in the hot remnant immediately after binary neutron star merger , then we would need to understand how differential rotation affects the mechanism .",
    "it is easy to see that the co - rotation point could be relevant for this discussion . according to an inertial observer",
    "the r - mode is prograde for any stellar rotation rate with a frequency proportional to the bulk rotation rate ( like all inertial modes ) .",
    "if such a mode enters the co - rotation region it should do so by crossing the low - frequency boundary which corresponds to the equatorial angular velocity @xmath152 ( at least for `` reasonable '' rotation laws like the j - constant law ) .",
    "however , it is not clear from the results in the literature if the r - mode actually enters the co - rotation region .",
    "so far , the r - mode frequency in differentially rotating stars has only been determined in newtonian gravity by  @xcite . for a @xmath147 polytrope and the j - constant rotation law ,",
    "their results show that the r - mode is not in co - rotation for stars with @xmath153 .",
    "however , the mode clearly approaches the co - rotation band when @xmath154 .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical code used by  @xcite was not accurate for higher degrees of differential rotation ( presumably because the co - rotation point corresponds to a singularity in the frequency domain description of the problem ) .",
    "as our numerical framework is based on time evolving the perturbation equations , our analysis is not affect by this issue and we can determine the r - mode frequency for lower values of @xmath67 .",
    "this allows us to check if the r - mode goes in co - rotation for a high degree of differential rotation . to carry out this exercise",
    ", we use the cowling approximation which is known to provides accurate results for the r - mode frequency  @xcite . considering models with a fixed axis ratio , @xmath155 , respectively , @xmath156 and 0.6 , we determine the @xmath0 r - mode frequency for @xmath157 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : r - mode ] .",
    "we find that , even though the r - mode approaches the co - rotation region as the degree of differential rotation is increased , it never really enters the co - rotation region ( more than marginally ) . in all cases",
    "we have considered , the r - mode stays very close to the equatorial boundary , i.e. @xmath158 , as the rotation rate increases .",
    "we have found no evidence that the r - mode suffers a shearing instability analogous to the low t / w instability in the f - mode .",
    "it is not clear whether this is because no such instability exists or if it is simply the case that the growth time is too large to overcome the numerical dissipation in the examples we have studied ( as one would expect for a mode located at the boundary of the co - rotation region ) .",
    "we have developed a framework for numerical time evolutions of linear perturbations of differentially rotating , newtonian , stars . within this framework",
    "we have carried out a large parameter survey for polytropic stars described by the standard j - constant rotation law , focussing on the fundamental f - mode and the low t / w instability .",
    "our results for the instability growth time confirm the assertion of @xcite that the instability sets in at the point when the f - mode first enters the co - rotation region ( when there is a point in the star where the pattern speed in the star matches the local rotation rate of the background fluid ) .",
    "we have used the integrands of the canonical energy and angular momentum to highlight the close relationship between the instability and the co - rotation point . by considering the relevant stellar parameters we have also obtained a relatively simple empirical relation which describes how the growth rate of the low t / w instability increases",
    "as the f - mode moves into the co - rotation region , reaches a maximum and then tapers off as the mode exits the unstable region again .",
    "our analysis has , in many ways , been of an exploratory nature .",
    "our main aim was to map out the relevant parameter space and provide clear evidence for the link between the co - rotation boundary and the onset of instability .",
    "as they stand the results seem convincing in this respect .",
    "this is quite an important conclusion because it would be sufficient to know that the f - mode of a given configuration lies inside the co - rotation region to know that the mode should be ( at least in principle ) unstable .",
    "further work is needed to confirm this conclusion for other rotation laws and more realistic equations of state , but we have no reason to expect that the qualitative behaviour would change much in other cases .",
    "more detailed work is also needed in order to explain the form of the empirical relation we have found for the instability growth rate .",
    "ideally , one would like to be able to derive this result from underlying principles , but this seems like an very difficult problem .",
    "one might be able to make progress using the canonical energy / angular momentum arguments from @xcite .",
    "however , this would likely require a frequency domain approach which would be hampered by the singularity associated with the co - rotation point .",
    "unfortunately , the fact that the instability analysis only holds ( strictly ) for inviscid systems means that we have been unable to use our results to make progress in this direction ( the numerical simulations involves the standard artificial viscosity to stabilize the evolutions ) .",
    "we have also not been able to extract the mode eigenfunctions with sufficient precision due to the exponential growth of the perturbation variables during the instability .",
    "it seems possible that future work could do better in this regard .",
    "we would certainly encourage efforts in this direction .",
    "finally , we used our computational framework to consider the inertial r - modes . in this case , our results extend previous work to higher degrees of differential rotation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the r - modes do not ( at least for our stellar models ) evolve into the co - rotation region .",
    "rather , they remain near the boundary of this region for rapidly and differentially rotating stars .",
    "this is an interesting result in its own right , and a clear demonstration of the usefulness of our numerical framework .",
    "the result may also be relevant for relativistic studies of the r - mode where the frame - dragging provides an effect that is qualitatively similar to differential rotation . for non - barotropic stars , in particular , the relativistic r - mode problem is known to be complicated .",
    "based on the present evidence it would be tempting to suggest that time - evolutions of the kind used in the present work may prove a powerful tool also in that setting .",
