    "the lhc experiments have started taking data to aim for the discovery of new physics .",
    "as one of the leading candidates for the new physics , various models of low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) have been constructed and their signatures have been studied .",
    "especially , discovery and mass measurements in `` representative '' models such as the minimal supergravity and the minimal gauge mediation model have been extensively studied @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "susy is motivated as a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking via the higgs mechanism is naturalized by this space - time symmetry .",
    "however , when we closely look at the `` representative '' models used for the collider studies , we encounter a naturalness problem in the higgs sector . the experimental lower bound on the higgs mass requires a heavy scalar top quark ( stop ) , which results in a delay of the cancellation of quadratic divergence .",
    "the problem is , however , not model independent even within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "for example , the problem in the minimal supergravity model is the large logarithm , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the stop mass and the planck scale , respectively ) , in the radiative corrections of the higgs mass parameter .",
    "the logarithm , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the messenger scale ) , can be small in the minimal gauge mediation model .",
    "however the small @xmath8-term is the problem in this case ; the higgs boson mass requires a very heavy stop otherwise the large @xmath8-term is required .",
    "the conditions for the naturalness have been summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( a ) light stops , ( b ) light higgsinos , ( c ) a moderately large value of @xmath9 , ( d ) a large @xmath8-term and ( e ) a small logarithm .    in the discussion of the naturalness of the electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "the most relevant parameter is the stop mass due to the large top yukawa coupling and the color factor . in the mssm ,",
    "the stop mass , @xmath4 ( the geometric mean of the two stop masses ) , should be at most about 600  gev for the fine tuning to be better than at the level of 10  %  @xcite . here , a small logarithm ( the low messenger scale ) of @xmath10  tev is assumed .",
    "even with such a light stop , the lower bound on the higgs boson mass from the lep - ii experiments  @xcite can be satisfied within the mssm when the @xmath8-parameter ( the stop - stop - higgs coupling ) is as large as of order the stop mass  @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for the study of the @xmath8-parameter dependence of the higgs boson mass in the mssm . )",
    "imposing the absence of significant fine tuning at the level of 10% , the naturalness upper bound on @xmath4 ( which gets severer from above for a large @xmath8-parameter ) and a large stop mixing through the large @xmath8-parameter required from the higgs boson mass constraint imply that the lighter stop should be lighter than about @xmath11  gev for @xmath12  tev .",
    "other sfermions and gauginos ( gluinos , winos and binos ) can be as heavy as a few tev without affecting the naturalness of the electroweak symmetry breaking . on the other hand , as the supersymmetric higgs mass @xmath13 is added up to the soft supersymmetry breaking higgs mass parameters , @xmath13 ( the higgsino mass ) should be of the electroweak scale to be natural .",
    "the superparticle spectrum is important when we discuss signatures at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "if we take the naturalness seriously in supersymmetric models , we see that there should be significant amount of the stop production at the lhc .",
    "if other sparticles except for the higgsinos are heavier than 1 tev , superparticle productions will be dominated by lighter stops and they all decay into higgsinos directly . this is the minimal model of natural susy at the lhc , that is simply a system with a stop and higgsinos ( two neutralinos and a chargino ) .",
    "the requirement of the small logarithm implies a low energy susy breaking scenario ( see  @xcite for an interesting exception ) , and thus we also include the nearly massless gravitino , to which the lightest higgsino can decay .    in the case where the higgsino is heavier than the stop",
    ", the stop directly decays into a top quark and a gravitino if open .",
    "those events look like @xmath14 productions .",
    "we will not consider such a case in this paper .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a study of such an event topology . in the case where the top quark is not open ,",
    "the stop undergoes the three body decay into @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the gravitino .",
    "such a case has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are attempts of model - building and studies of collider signatures with similar motivations .",
    "more minimal supersymmetry  @xcite has the first two generation sparticles at around 5 to 20 tev to solve supersymmetry flavor and cp problems while keeping the naturalness for the electroweak symmetry breaking . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a signature of a large @xmath8-term at the lhc has been discussed .",
    "see the partial list of recent related works in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study lhc signatures of a model with light stops , light higgsinos and a ( nearly ) massless gravitino . as we have discussed , it is well - motivated to consider a very light stop such as @xmath17  gev .",
    "with such a light colored particle , the lhc will be very powerful .",
    "we assume that other superparticles are heavy enough to be ignored or even absent as particle states by directly coupling to the susy breaking sector ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "such a spectrum is also motivated by the constraints from cp - violation and flavor physics . the susy events with the largest cross section",
    "are therefore a pair production of the lighter stop .",
    "the main decay mode of the stop is into a bottom ( @xmath15 ) quark and a chargino .",
    "the chargino subsequently decays into a neutralino and soft jets or leptons which we can ignore due to a small mass splitting between the charged and the neutral higgsinos .",
    "the neutralino then decays into a @xmath18 boson or a higgs boson and a gravitino .",
    "the final state is @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 with missing momentum .",
    "we analyze these events and consider methods to find the stop .",
    "we also discuss the measurement of the stop and the higgsino masses as well as the discovery of the higgs boson through this process .",
    "we start with the review of the naturalness in electroweak symmetry breaking in the mssm ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . generally in electroweak symmetry",
    "breaking via the higgs mechanism , there is a relation between the higgs boson mass @xmath22 and the quadratic term in the potential ( the negative mass squared ) , @xmath23 : @xmath24 in the mssm , @xmath25 can be as large as 130  gev  @xcite . for a moderately large value of @xmath26 , electroweak symmetry breaking is mainly due to the vacuum expectation value of the up - type higgs field , @xmath27 . in this case , the @xmath23 parameter has two sources : @xmath28 the first and the second terms are positive and negative , respectively .",
    "a fine tuning is required if there are contribution to @xmath29 which are much larger than @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "an obvious conclusion from above is that the @xmath13 parameter ( the higgsino mass ) can not be very large .",
    "if we measure the fine tuning by @xmath32 and require @xmath33 for example , we obtain @xmath34    another important contribution is from the stop - top loop diagrams to the @xmath35 parameter .",
    "there are two kinds of interactions in the diagrams ; one with the top yukawa interaction ( @xmath36 ) and another through the three - point stop - stop - higgs interaction ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the three - point interaction also provides an important contribution to the higgs boson mass , @xmath25 . by assuming a small logarithm ( @xmath10  tev )",
    ", we obtain upper and lower bounds on the stop mass parameter ( @xmath38 ) from the naturalness and the higgs boson mass bound , respectively . requiring @xmath33 and @xmath39  gev  @xcite , where @xmath40 with @xmath41 the stop - loop contribution , the bounds are @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "there is no allowed region for @xmath46 or @xmath47 . for @xmath48",
    ", we obtain @xmath49  gev  @xcite . ] .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath50 is about 20% which can be achieved when @xmath45 .",
    "the naturalness upper bound on the lighter stop mass is then , @xmath51 @xmath52 for @xmath33 .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no tight naturalness constraint on other superparticles .",
    "the gaugino loop can contribute to @xmath35 or @xmath4 , but the masses can be as large as a few tev .",
    "other sfermions can contribute @xmath35 or @xmath4 through the gauge interactions at two - loop level or through the yukawa interactions at one - loop level .",
    "again , masses at a few tev do not cause a naturalness problem .",
    "therefore , the minimal set - up for natural supersymmetry is light stops and light higgsinos ; we ignore all other superparticles since the superparticle productions will be anyway dominated by the pair productions of the lighter stop .",
    "the requirement of the small logarithm implies low energy susy breaking scenarios such as gauge mediation @xcite . in that case",
    ", there is a nearly massless gravitino to which the lightest mssm particle can decay promptly in collider experiments such as the lhc .",
    "this minimal set - up is not particularly motivated by a known uv model of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is usually the case that the discussion of collider signatures of susy models requires an assumption of the whole spectrum and that is why a benchmark model has been needed .",
    "however , the fact that the naturalness consideration predicts a very light colored particle allows us to postpone the discussion of the detailed structure of the model or the spectrum .",
    "conversely , one can test the naturalness principle by looking for a light stop and a light higgsino .",
    "in the study of the stop / higgsino / gravitino system , there are four parameter regions which give distinct signatures at the lhc . in fig .  [",
    "fig : kinemat ] we show the four regions ( i)(iv ) .",
    "if the higgsino is heavier than the stop and the stop is heavier than the top quark ( region ( ii ) ) , the stop will decay directly into a top quark and a gravitino .",
    "the final state in this case is @xmath53 with missing momentum .",
    "such events may not be easy to be distinguished from the @xmath53 events .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a study of this event topology .",
    "the case with @xmath54 ( region ( i ) ) has been studied in ref .",
    "there the differences in the distributions of kinematical variables between the signal and the @xmath53 events have been discussed .        in this study , we assume the lighter stop is heavier than the higgsino , and the higgsino decays into the gravitino ( regions ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) .",
    "the final states are very different from the case with regions ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the main production process is the pair production of the lighter stops , and then the stops decay into the higgsinos .",
    "the lightest higgsino ( which we assume to be neutral ) in turn decays into @xmath18 or @xmath55 ( the lightest higgs boson ) plus a gravitino .",
    "if the susy breaking scale @xmath56 is higher than about 100  tev , the higgsino lifetime is long enough to show a displaced vertex at the level of a sub millimeter .",
    "such a situation has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and found that the lhc can discover the neutralino if @xmath57 is around @xmath58@xmath59 @xmath60 by looking for displaced @xmath18 bosons ( @xmath61 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath62 ) . if the displaced @xmath18 bosons are observed , they are a strong indication of the neutralino / gravitino system .    for @xmath63",
    "smaller than about 100  tev , which may be reasonable to assume from the requirement of a low messenger scale , the displaced vertex of the higgsino decay will be difficult to observe .",
    "in such a case , the event topology resembles to the case with a stop / higgsino / bino system .",
    "we will discuss possible ways to distinguish those two scenarios later . in the following analyses ,",
    "in particular in the mass measurements , we implicitly make an assumption that the higgsino decays into a nearly massless gravitino , not a massive bino .",
    "the assumption should be tested by other processes or by looking for displaced vertices .      in the following",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation of the susy events at the lhc .",
    "we use the following parameters for the higgsino / stop sector : @xmath64 @xmath65 and we take other superparticle masses to be 1  tev so that one can ignore the production of those particles .",
