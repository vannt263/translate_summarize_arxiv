    "furthermore , large size micromegas development is ongoing for the planned high luminosity upgrade of the atlas detector at cern @xcite .",

    "we developed triple gem detectors @xcite , based on framed cern gem foils with an active area of 100mm@xmath5100 mm .",
    "the gem foils consist of 50@xmath1 m thick kapton , double - sidedly coated with 5@xmath1 m copper . at a mutual pitch of 140@xmath1 m",
    ", conical holes with an outer diameter of 70@xmath1 m and an inner diameter of 50@xmath1 m are etched into the foil .",
    "negative charges , produced in the region between cathode and upper gem foil , drift towards the gem in a 1.5kv / cm electric field . a potential difference of around 350v between two copper layers of each gem cause high electric fields on the order of 70kv / cm in the holes such that gas amplification occurs . gradually rising fields between the gem foils extract part of the produced negative charge , such that sufficiently high signals are detectable on the readout structure .",
    "several prototypes have been built , the latest consists of a cathode of aluminized mylar held at a distance of 3 mm above the stack of three gem foils , which are separated by 2 mm from each other and from the readout structure , formed by 360 strips with 100 mm length , 150@xmath1 m width and 250@xmath1 m pitch .",
    "we will refer to the region between cathode and upper gem foil as drift region , the gaps between the foils are called transfer gaps and the region between anode and lower gem foil is referred to as induction gap .",
    "in order to conduct signal studies and investigate the general behavior of both detector types , signals of a single charge sensitive preamplifier were recorded , using a 1ghz flash adc .",
    "a typical signal is shown in fig.[fig : measchaanode ] .",
    "different groups of anode readout strips were connected , forming single readout planes of different area .",
    "all other strips were grounded .",
    "the edge of the charge signals was parametrized by a fermi - like function .",
    "pulse heights , rise times and timing fluctuation , provided that the readout was triggered externally , can be deduced from this fit function .    for measurements with a @xmath6fe source ,",
    "a trigger signal was derived from the preamplifier signal by amplification and shaping with a fast timing filter amplifier and subsequent discrimination in a low threshold discriminator .",
    "the dominant @xmath6fe@xmath7-line at 5.9kev is used for studies of the pulse height dependence on several operational parameters .",
    "cosmic signals were triggered by coincident signals from two scintillators above and below the detector and the detector itself . by comparing the number of coincident scintillator",
    "triggers to the number of threefold coincidences , the efficiency was calculated .",
    "a geometric correction had to be applied to the number of scintillator triggers , since their active area was slightly larger , than the active region of the gas detectors .      in order to obtain stable and reproduceable operation parameters , and prevent oxygen from entering the detectors ,",
    "the gas pressure was controlled and set to a slight overpressure of 1013 mbar .",
    "several brooks mass flow controllers adjust the gas composition , that is mixed in a gas mixer and passed to the detector . a regulation valve in combination with a pressure meter and a pi - controller stabilizes the pressure in the system at the preset value .",
    "usually an overall flow on the order of 1ln / h was used .",
    "detector efficiencies for muons of more than 98% are achieved in both detector types . in micromegas",
    ", the efficiency is limited by the mesh supporting pillars , covering 1.1% of the active area .",
    "the fwhm energy resolution for 5.9kev x - rays is 19.2% for the triple gem detector and 24.3% for the micromegas .",

    "the anode charge signals observed in micromegas are the sum of the very fast electron signal and the slower induction signal , created by the drifting and vanishing ion cloud .",
    "they can be calculated analytically .",
    "similar results have been stated in @xcite for a parallel plate avalanche chamber .",

    "we assume the gas amplification to be instantaneous .",
    "gas amplification , according to townsend gives the electron charge @xmath10 as well as the ion charge @xmath11 as a function of the distance @xmath12 from the anode @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the first townsend coefficient .",
    "at @xmath15 the situation is as follows : all produced electron charge @xmath16 has reached the anode , the positive ion cloud , described by the charge density in planes with thickness @xmath17 parallel to anode and mesh @xmath18 , induces a negative surface charge @xmath19 on the anode and @xmath20 on the mesh .",
    "no ion charge has reached the mesh yet , i.e.  @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted , that we will calculate the actually measureable signal .",

    "the detectable charges on anode @xmath23 and mesh @xmath24 are then given by @xmath25    taking into account the constant ion drift velocity @xmath26 in the homogeneous amplification field , the observable signals can be calculated .",

    "a measured anode charge signal is shown in fig.[fig : measchaanode ] .",
    "its amplitude rises to its maximum value within 150ns and shows linear rise behavior , smoothed out at the edges by the preamplifier .",
    "this behavior is reproduced by the analytic calculation , although the applied preamplifier , showing an intrinsic rise time of 25ns , is not fast enough to resolve the steep initial rise of the signal . nevertheless , with a fast current sensitive preamplifier and a small detector ,",
    "this fast and very short signal , formed by 14% of the total signal charge , has been observed ( @xcite ) and can be used for sub nanosecond triggering purposes .",
    "the pulse height of signals depends strongly on the complex capacitor network , formed by the anode readout strips , the mesh and detector ground .",
    "two seperate studies have been conducted , using the @xmath6fe@xmath7-line at 5.9kev .",
    "interconnecting different numbers , @xmath27 , of neighboring readout strips to form a single readout plane and grounding the other @xmath28 strips , revealed an increase of the pulse height by almost a factor of 10 when going from 360 to 18 interconnected readout strips ( fig.[fig:1111phvsnostrips ] ) . varying the mesh to ground capacitance by adding discrete capacitors , while reading out all 360 strips connected together , caused an increase of the pulse height by a factor of 4 ( fig.[fig:1111pheicscap ] ) .",
    "both effects can be quantitatively described by the parameter - free capacitor model , shown in fig.[fig : micomsimschrev2 ] , that allows for the numerical calculation of signals , using the circuit simulation program ltspice iv .",
    "the agreement of the data and the numerical calculation can be seen in fig.[fig : pheivscaps ] .",
    "the temporal behavior of the signal and the influence of the induction and drift gap parameters on the signal in double gem detectors has been treated in @xcite .",
    "signal formation in gem detectors is less complicated , since the influence of the ion drift on the anode signal can be neglected .",
    "the observed charge signal is created by induction of the drifting electron cloud towards the anode and shows a linear fall under the assumption of a constant electron drift velocity , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective gas gain and @xmath31 the induction field dependent electron drift velocity .",
    "the rise time of charge signals , produced by a localized amount of charge , is given by the electron drift time in the induction region . in fig.[fig:051011gemtrisevseind ] the measured 10%-90% signal rise time is plotted as a function of the induction field together with the calculated drift time of the electrons in the induction gap .",
    "the measured rise times are systematically larger than the simulated electron drift times , but the functional behavior is correctly reproduced .",
    "part of this discrepancy might be due to the non - neglegible rise time of the preamplifier , differing gem - anode distances or gas parameters . as described in the previous section for micromegas",
    ", we observe a significant rise of the pulse height of 5.9kev x - ray signals in the gem detector with a decreasing number of interconnected readout strips , although the increase is not as large as with micromegas .    fe signals as a function of the induction field ( black circles ) and computed electron drift times in the induction gap ( red triangles ) . ]",
    "the cosmic muon tracking system consists of four micromegas , mounted on a stable aluminum frame ( fig.[fig : gassisetup4micoms ] ) .",
    "it is used for determining the spatial resolution of micromegas in different radiative background environments .",
    "all readout strips point into the @xmath32-direction , such that two - dimensional track reconstruction in the @xmath33-@xmath12-plane is possible .",
    "each detector is read out by six frontend boards with 64 channels each , originally developed for the hades - rich detector and adapted for micromegas like signals @xcite . on each frontend board ,",
    "charge to voltage conversion is achieved by four gassiplex chips with 16 channels each .",
    "digitization , discrimination and multi event - buffering is performed on the frontend boards , directly mounted on the detector .",
    "unlike in the hermes scintillating fibre detector , that used the same boards with a slightly different hardware configuration , we observed neither crosstalk nor signal non - linearities .",
    "this was achieved by reconfiguring the onboard multiplexing amplifier , that is used for matching the gassiplex output to the input range of the adc",
    ". an event readout rate of about 10khz is expected to be realizable .    a three - fold segmented 100mm@xmath5100 mm scintillator trigger hodoscope provides information about the third track coordinate .",
    "triggering muons have an energy larger than 600mev , if they can cross the 450 mm thick lead absorber above a 400mm@xmath5800 mm large scintillator panel .",
    "the hodoscope data are acquired via unused channels on a frontend in the uppermost micromegas , such that a precise offline selection of events is possible . due to the relatively small solid angle",
    ", the trigger rate is @xmath34min@xmath35 .",
    "stable operation over weeks has been observed .",
    "primary hits in each detector are found by using the center of gravity method for the strips around the one with maximum pulse height ( 94% of tracks ) .",
    "only strips are regarded , that have passed a criterion for the pulse height , beeing 3@xmath36 above background . in case of hit ambiguities in one detector ,",
    "those hits are regarded as true , that lie on a 5.25 mm wide road , defined by hits in the other three detectors ( 6% of tracks ) .",
    "the single detector spatial resolution is determined as follows : a track , defined by hits @xmath37 and @xmath38 in two detectors is interpolated into a third detector , sandwiched by them .",
    "the difference between the actual hit in the third detector @xmath39 and the prediction through interpolation is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the distance between the 1st and 2nd detector . for each four - detector - track ,",
    "four different combinations of three detectors are possible , yielding four @xmath42s . using gaussian error propagation , a set of four equations",
    "can be derived , connecting the widths of the four @xmath42 distributions @xmath43 $ ] with the spatial resolutions in all detectors @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "we assume , that the resolution is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the intrinsic spatial resolution , which is equal for all detectors , and @xmath48 is the detector dependent contribution from multiple scattering . assuming a simple linear dependence for the multiple scattering @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the distance between the uppermost and the @xmath51-th detector , the intrinsic resolution @xmath47 is obtained from solving the equation system .",
    "we studied the behavior of the tracking system under irradiation with a @xmath52cs - source , dominantly emitting gammas with @xmath53kev , and a @xmath54cf - source , emitting neutrons and gammas with a broad energy distribution with energy up to @xmath55mev and @xmath56mev , @xmath57mev and @xmath58kev .",
    "the sources were positioned right on top of the third micromegas from the top . using the @xmath52cs - source ,",
    "this micromegas registered a hit rate of @xmath59khz , corresponding to a gamma flux rate of @xmath60hz with an efficiency of @xmath61 . with the @xmath54cf - source ,",
    "an overall hit rate of @xmath62hz was measured .",
    "spontaneous fission causes a neutron flux rate in the detector of @xmath63khz and a gamma flux rate of @xmath64khz . for the efficiency to neutrons ,",
    "an upper bound of @xmath65 at 95% cl was determined .",
    "the efficiencies have been determined by simply counting signals and correcting for background hits .",
    "the deadtime of the detector can be neglected in this case .",
    "a pulse shape discriminating scintillator was used to characterize the @xmath54cf - source @xcite .    without gamma or neutron irradiation ,",
    "the mean sparking rate of the four micromegas was @xmath66min@xmath35 .",
    "it showed a slight increase to @xmath67min@xmath35 under irradiation by the @xmath52cs - source , the sparking rate in the dominantly irradiated micromegas 3 did not show a significant increase .",

    "the single detector spatial resolution has been determined , using the method , described above . assuming that the spatial resolution is equal in all detectors , this method yields an intrinsic spatial resolution for cosmic muons of @xmath70 m in the run without gamma or neutron background . in measurements with the @xmath52cs - source ,",
    "no degradation of the spatial resolution was visible .",
