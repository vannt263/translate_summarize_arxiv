    "models of mass loss on the agb are essential for understanding the late stages of stellar evolution . in practice",
    ", the modelling of stellar evolution requires a prescription of mass - loss rates as a function of basic stellar parameters .",
    "empirical studies , such as the classical one by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) , can only provide a limited amount of information , since one can not easily study the effect of individual parameters .",
    "the reason for this is of course that the evolution of the stellar parameters is interconnected and we can only observe stars at a given evolutionary stage .",
    "observations can tell us about the mass loss for a given set of stellar parameters , but the exact dependences on these parameters are unfortunately degenerated .",
    "numerical modelling has one major advantage here : it can be used as a tool for constraining the actual physics involved in wind formation . from the early efforts , e.g.  by bowen ( 1988 ) and fleischer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , to our latest models @xcite , a lot of the physics behind dust - driven winds has been brought to light .",
    "much work still remains to be done , but we have now reached a reasonable level of realism in the modelling , as shown by detailed comparison with observations . a picture has emerged with dust - driven winds as a complex phenomenon , where the onset of mass loss requires particular circumstances .",
    "in fact , c stars with strong dust - driven winds may be a rare species even if most c stars apparenly lose mass .",
    "with this in mind , one may ask : what are the consequences for stellar evolution , nucleosynthesis , and consequently the chemical evolution of galaxies ?",
    "the common hypothesis about how detached shells around tp - agb stars are formed is that these structures are a consequence of the mass - loss modulations during the phase of he - shell flashes / thermal pulses @xcite .",
    "previous modelling has shown that interactions between different wind phases that arise from variations in the wind velocity and mass - loss rate are capable of producing such shells @xcite .    using the rhd code for dynamic atmospheres by hfner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in combination with a stellar evolutionary track of a @xmath0 m@xmath1 , @xmath2 star as input ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details about the stellar evolution model ) , we have calculated the wind evolution during a he - shell flash @xcite .",
    "with this evolution computed , we constructed a time - dependent inner boundary condition for a hydrodynamic model of the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) evolution .",
    "the observed wind and mass - loss properties associated with detached shells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are rather well reproduced using stellar parameters sampled from the evolutionary track .",
    "we tried different amplitudes for the piston boundary condition which is used to simulate the stellar pulsation and found that too high amplitudes lead to very little wind interaction and thus no shell structure is formed ( see figure [ fixedtemp ] ) .",
    "too low amplitudes , on the other hand , tend to prohibit any wind formation at all .",
    "it seems that for the stellar parameters investigated here , the optimal piston amplitude is @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 , and this value may perhaps be used to constrain the pulsation properties .",
    "it is also interesting to note that existing mass - loss prescriptions for agb stars imply mass - loss evolutions that are not only different in comparison with our detailed model , but are rarely consistent with each other , either ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , constraints on the mass - loss evolution derived from observations @xcite appear to agree better with our results than with these mass - loss formulae .",
    "we are currently in the process of computing a large grid of dynamical c star atmosphere models .",
    "the overall purpose of the grid is to explore how the mass - loss rate depends on the stellar parameters . in a future step of this project",
    "we will consider how pulsations and winds affect the spectral properties of c stars as well , but here we will discuss only the wind formation and the mass loss itself .    before summarising the numerical results , it is worthwhile to consider some fundamental aspects of the onset of dust - driven winds from a basic physics point of view .",
    "the condensation of dust grains is very sensitive to temperature and is prohibited by high gas temperatures and low densities , which means that every c star has a _ condensation radius _ ( @xmath5 )  a critical radius inside which dust grains can not condense  as well as an outer radius where the condensation stops .",
    "furthermore , in order to levitate the material out to @xmath5 , the acceleration of the gas due to pulsations and radiation must be large enough .",
    "there can not be any circumstellar dust formation and hence no dust - driven wind if insufficient material is transported out to @xmath5 .",
    "the location of @xmath5 will depend on the effective temperature of the star , as well as on its photospheric radius .",
    "then , quite obviously , there must be a temperture - dependent threshold for the formation dust - driven winds .",
    "the sudden drop in the mass - loss rate and wind velocity above @xmath6 k is probably even steeper than figure [ trends ] seems to indicate , due to a grid spacing of @xmath7 k.    another very obvious threshold emerges as we consider the wind acceleration process after the onset of dust formation . beyond the condensation radius @xmath5 ,",
    "the criterion for wind formation is that the radiative acceleration must be strong enough to overcome the gravitational field of the star , i.e. @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the ratio of the radiative to the gravitational acceleration ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the radiative acceleration is proportional to the dust opacity @xmath10 , which is a function of the abundance of free carbon @xmath11 and the mean degree of dust condensation @xmath12 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "since @xmath13 , we have that @xmath14 thus , for a given mass and luminosity , there must exist a critical value of @xmath15 ( or more exactly @xmath16 ) for which @xmath17 .",
    "we also note that this critical @xmath15 can not be arbitrarily close to unity for realistic stellar parameters .",
    "let us now turn to the numerical modelling results .",
    "we present here a sub - grid of models of stars with @xmath18 l@xmath1 , @xmath19 m@xmath1 , @xmath20 z@xmath1 and @xmath21 km  s@xmath4 , where we vary @xmath22 and @xmath15 .",
    "to eliminate the pulsation period ( free parameter ) , we employ an empirical period - luminosity relation @xcite .",
    "the predicted threshold appears as expected and we find that for @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 k no dust - driven wind is formed with the other parameters fixed as above ( see fig .",
    "[ trends ] ) .",
    "thus , any mass loss in this part of parameter space is likely due to some other mechanism .",
    "since the surface gravity scales with @xmath22 , it is quite expected that mass loss scales with @xmath22 , too .",
    "but we also see a rather strong dependence on @xmath15 for both the wind velocity and the mass - loss rate , which is quite interesting in comparison with previous studies of this kind .",
    "arndt et al .  ( 1997 ) as well as wachter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue for a weak dependence on @xmath15 , which stands in sharp contrast to the results presented here .",
    "this is probably due to the parameter range for which these formulae where developed , as well as differences in the basic model assumptions .",

    "mass loss affects stellar evolution is various ways . for c stars the duration of the agb phase and",
    "the number of thermal pulses is almost solely determined by the mass - loss rate .",
    "the internal structure depends on the mass - loss rate as well @xcite , which in turn affects the fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "since the mass - loss rate depends on these stellar parameters , there is an interesting feedback mechanism at work here , which means that the mass - loss prescription put into a stellar evolution model is critical .",
    "the observed initial - final mass relation is our best empirical constraint , but it can just tell us the total mass lost during the rgb and agb phase . hence , much of the agb evolution will only be guess - work as long as we do not understand mass loss properly .",
    "perhaps even more interesting , in the context of this conference , is the effect on nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is well known that varying the mass - loss rate can have profound effects on the chemical yields for agb stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as we pointed out above , the mass - loss rate determines the number of thermal pulses , which represents the maximum possible number of third dredge - up ( tdu ) episodes .",
    "furthermore , it can also determine if and when the tdu begins and ends @xcite .",
    "needless to say , a correct implementation of mass loss is essential to obtain realistic yields for agb stars , and the agb contribution to the chemical evolution of galaxies therefore still has to be regarded as uncertain .",
    "this also becomes evident when different sets of agb yields are compared @xcite .",
    "existing mass - loss prescriptions for agb stars are inconsistent with each other and simple mass - loss prescriptions might be hard to obtain .",
    "here we have tried to show that it may be dangerous to use parametric mass - loss formualae including too few stellar parameters . moreover",
    ", the first results from our new detailed model grid suggests that c stars with strong winds may be quite rare .",
    "how would this affect stellar evolution ?",
    "chemical evolution ?",
    "the present dynamic atmosphere models compare well with observations and it is therefore likely that we are beginning to understand the wind mechanism well enough to be able to reduce the current uncertainties related to the mass - loss evolution of c stars .",
    "you state that for c / o @xmath25 1.2 mass - loss does nt happen .",
    "but the literature suggests that c / o @xmath25 1.2 for _ most _ c stars . and most c stars have dust ( sic 11  @xmath26 m feature ) .",
    "how do you reconcile these ?",
    "yes , about 75% of all observed c stars have c / o ratios below 1.2 , but still mass - loss is detected .",
    "what our models tell us is that below 1.2 there is no strong , dust - driven wind",
    ". the observed mass - loss must be due to some other mechanism , if the dust is there .",
    "you slid by the piston amplitude issue .",
    "good piston constraints are essential for a good theoretical m relation .",
    "we found the following very important : keep track of the work done on it by the piston .",
    "limit this to be @xmath29 .",
    "see cox & giuli .",
    "this gave @xmath30 consistent with vassiliadis & wood , the only reliable empirical determination .",
    "i also see a problem that there is a large number of carbon stars with higher temperature and lower c / o losing mass .",
    "maybe dust is not the driver there .",
    "however , do not trust any published c / o ratios for agb variables",
    ". there are large uncertainties ."
