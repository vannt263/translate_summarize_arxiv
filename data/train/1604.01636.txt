    "understanding the nature of the mesonic resonances listed in ref .",
    "@xcite is an important topic of both experimental and theoretical hadron physics . in the vector kaonic sector with @xmath2",
    "( @xmath6 stands for isospin , @xmath7 for total spin , and @xmath8 for parity ) , the resonance @xmath9 corresponds very well to the expected quark - antiquark states @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; moreover , its spectral function is nicely described by a ( relativistic ) breit - wigner function . on the contrary ,",
    "the scalar kaonic sector @xmath5 is much more complicated .",
    "two resonance are listed in the pdg below 1.5 gev : the broad but well - established @xmath14 and the very broad and light @xmath3 ( also known as @xmath15 ) , whose existence still requires definitive confirmation ( for discussions , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . the inclusion of @xmath15 in the summary table of pdg would allow to complete the nonet of light scalar states in the energy region below @xmath16 gev .",
    "the aim of this work , based on  ref .",
    "@xcite , is to study the nature of the vector and scalar kaonic resonances . by using qft lagrangians ,",
    "we determine the coordinates of the poles on the complex plane and study their nature by using the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we confirm that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are standard quark - antiquark states , while @xmath3 is a dynamically generated state .",
    "in order to describe @xmath17 and @xmath14 we introduce relativistic lagrangians that couples them to one kaon and one pion:@xmath19 the expressions above contain non - derivative and derivative interaction terms .",
    "the dots stay for the sum over isospin and hermitian conjugation .",
    "the terms in  eq .",
    "( 1 ) naturally emerge as a subset of more complete mesonic models , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . according to our models ,",
    "the decay widths of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( as function of the running mass @xmath22 ) are : @xmath23   f_{\\lambda}(m)\\text { , } % \\]]@xmath24   ^{2}f_{\\lambda } ( m)\\text { , } % \\ ] ] where the form factor @xmath25 has been introduced .",
    "@xmath26 is an energy scale , @xmath27 the three - momentum of one outgoing particle , @xmath28 the kaon mass , and @xmath29 the pion mass .",
    "the on - shell decay widths are obtained by setting @xmath22 to the masses of @xmath20 or @xmath14 : this is accurate in the former case , but quite imprecise in the latter .",
    "the ( scalar part of the ) propagator of the resonances is given by @xmath30 ^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath31 is the bare mass of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the one - loop contribution .",
    "the spectral function which determines the probability that resonance has a mass between @xmath22 and @xmath34 reads : @xmath35 spectral functions must be normalized to unity . for details of the used formalism , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the spectral functions of @xmath17 and @xmath14 are shown in  fig .",
    "1 . for the vector kaon",
    "we observe a single peak close to @xmath36 gev and a ( unique ! ) pole at @xmath37 gev . in the scalar sector",
    ", there is a broad peak at about @xmath38 gev , but no peak corresponding to the light @xmath15 ( there is only a broad enhancement in the low - energy regime ) . in this channel , it turns out that there are two poles : @xmath39 gev , which corresponds to the seed state @xmath14 , and @xmath40 gev , which corresponds to @xmath3 as an additional companion pole .",
    "the parameters for the scalar channel were determined via a fit to existing pion - kaon data , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we studied the change of the spectral function for different values of the number of colors @xmath0 with the rescaling @xmath41 ( and so for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "when @xmath0 increases , the interaction becomes smaller . in both channels",
    "we observe that the peak becomes narrower and higher .",
    "however , in the scalar sector the enhancement of the @xmath15 becomes smaller for increasing @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the trajectories of the poles for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "one sees that the poles of @xmath17 and @xmath14 tend to the real axis , while that of @xmath3 goes away from it and finally disappears for @xmath44 in conclusion , all these results , with special focus on fig .",
    "2 which is the main outcome of the present proceedings , confirm that @xmath3 is a dynamically generated non - quarkonium meson .",
    "we have discussed the nature of @xmath17 , @xmath3 , and @xmath14 by using qft models presented in  ref .",
    "we find that @xmath17 and @xmath14 are regular quark - antiquark mesons ( see the quark - model review in @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "the spectral function has a well - pronounced peak ; in the large-@xmath0 limit the positions of the poles tend to the real axis , as it should for conventional mesons . on the contrary , @xmath3 does not correspond to a peak of the scalar spectral function , but there is a related pole in the complex plane .",
    "the original lagrangian contains a single scalar field , which is associated to @xmath14 , hence @xmath3 emerges as a companion pole of @xmath14 . in the large-@xmath0 limit the pole of @xmath3 disappears , confirming its non - quarkonium nature .",
