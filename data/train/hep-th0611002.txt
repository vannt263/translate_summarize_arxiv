    "the study of string vacua in flux compactifications of type iib has attracted much attention , in part as a setting where many properties of the landscape of vacua are under control ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the first issues to be addressed here is whether the number of realistic string vacua is finite  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown in  @xcite that the ashok - douglas index of supersymmetric vacua is finite .",
    "this is a crucial step towards proving the finiteness of flux vacua .",
    "the aim of the present work is to understand the physics underlying the previous result .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the index of supersymmetric vacua is finite around smooth points in moduli space ; the analysis may be restricted then to singularities of the moduli space where the curvature diverges .",
    "the finiteness proof  @xcite is based on weil - petersson geometry and a detailed analysis of degenerations of hodge structures on the moduli space .",
    "however , from the string theory point of view it is not clear which is the physical mechanism responsible for this . specially , why singularities leading to very different field theories all give a finite number of vacua .",
    "our approach may be summarized as follows .",
    "we construct calabi - yau s where singularities are easily embedded and argue for finiteness of vacua around them by computing their dual gauge theories .",
    "we establish a precise correspondence between flux and gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this shows that the gauge theories are generalized versions of the ones obtained through the dijkgraaf - vafa correspondence  @xcite ; but they still have finitely many vacua .",
    "as we shall see , the underlying reason for this is the topological nature of the chiral ring of such theories .    in section",
    "[ sec : generalcy ] we discuss the type iib noncompact model that can embed ade singularities and study the nonperturbative superpotential generated by fluxes .",
    "next , in section [ sec : fluxcurve ] we derive the formula for counting vacua in the previous setup ; this involves nontrivial steps because of the noncompact nature of the model .",
    "then in section [ sec : dualym ] we construct the dual gauge theory after the geometric transition , applying s - duality to the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action .",
    "the field theory turns out to be a generalization of the usual @xmath0 sym encountered in geometric transitions .",
    "the argument for finiteness of vacua is presented in section [ sec : finite ] ; it is based on the holomorphic dependence of the gauge effective superpotential on nondynamical fields ( couplings ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : examples ] we show that the computations from the gravity and gauge side agree for the conifold and argyres - douglas singularities .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we start by studying moduli stabilization in type iib theory in a calabi - yau threefold .",
    "since we are interested in analyzing a neighborhood of an ade singularity , it is enough to consider noncompact threefolds of the form @xmath1 the nontrivial dynamics comes from the complex curve @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "( [ eq : cy1 ] ) may be thought as a decoupling limit @xmath4 of an adequate compact variety  @xcite , although this will not be necessary for our purposes .    for concreteness ,",
    "let us consider the case of a hyperelliptic curve where we can realize singularities of the a - type : @xmath5 @xmath6 is a polynomial of degree @xmath7 , and will play the role of the superpotential in the gauge theory : @xmath8 @xmath9 is a deformation of the singular curve @xmath10 .",
    "its effect is to split @xmath11 .",
    "if all the roots of @xmath12 are different then the singular curve has just odp ( conifold ) singularities",
    ". we will also encounter more complicated singularities , where three or more roots coincide .",
    "the fact that ( [ eq : cy2 ] ) is the same variety that appears in the dijkgraaf - vafa duality  @xcite is not a coincidence ; the ( generalized ) gauge dual will play a major role in proving the finiteness of the number of vacua . furthermore ,",
    "such local string models have been considered recently in the context of soft supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .    for our future computations ,",
    "it is crucial to remark the following . in the four dimensional effective field theory ( eft ) , the moduli @xmath13 have a very different interpretation .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath14 have infinite energy and hence are non - dynamical ; each arbitrary choice of @xmath14 will give a different 4d theory so they can be interpreted as couplings . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath15 s are dynamical and are interpreted as scalar fields in vector multiplets .",
    "their gauge theory meaning will become clear in section [ sec : dualym ] .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the periods of the noncompact threefold reduce to periods of the hyperelliptic curve : @xmath16 with @xmath17 the cycle @xmath18 surrounds the cut @xmath19 $ ] ; @xmath20 is the noncompact cycle dual to @xmath18 , running from @xmath21 to infinity .",
    "the @xmath22-periods need to be regulated ; this will be discussed shortly",
    ". therefore all the computations can be done directly on the hyperelliptic curve @xmath23 of genus @xmath24 .",

    "the details of the homology of @xmath2 and the effect of the punctures were considered in  @xcite and we follow their conventions .",
    "a choice of homology cycles is shown in figure [ fig : homology ] ; @xmath34 runs through the @xmath35-th cut , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 . from these noncompact cycles we construct @xmath38 . besides , @xmath39 and @xmath40 circle the punctures at @xmath37 and @xmath36 respectively .",

    "so @xmath44 is not independent ; however , in @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",

    "this is the geometric analog of the rg running of the gauge couplings ( see sections [ sec : dualym ] and [ sec : finite ] ) .",
    "in this section we develop the necessary tools to count supersymmetric flux vacua on the hyperelliptic curve ( [ eq : cy2 ] ) .",
    "we will show that the index formula @xmath99 of  @xcite is still valid in our case .",
    "this is a priori not obvious , the main issues being that the curve is noncompact so many quantities need a regulator and the punctures contribute extra moduli that have to be included .",
    "furthermore , having fluxes @xmath96 that can vary continuously would immediately lead to an infinite number of vacua . and finally , we will have to introduce a tadpole cancellation condition .    counting supersymmetric flux vacua is equivalent to studying the geometry of the moduli space @xmath100 of @xmath45 .",
    "there are different ways of parametrizing it ; while from the eft it is natural to work with the @xmath101 , in the geometrical side it is more convenient to use the coefficients @xmath15 of the deformation @xmath102 .",

    "the moduli space is a special kahler manifold , with metric @xmath111 which can be derived from the kahler potential @xmath112 the covariant derivative is @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and the curvature tensor is @xmath115    a displacement in @xmath100 deforms the complex structure of @xmath2 , so we expect the holomorphic differentials @xmath116 to mix with the antiholomorphic ones .",
    "it is easy to show that the covariant derivative of a @xmath117 form gives a pure @xmath118 form : @xmath119 and the relation with the curvature is @xmath120      we want to count the vacua that preserve @xmath0 supersymmetry . in the limit @xmath4 ,",
    "supersymmetric solutions are given by @xmath121 , where @xmath122 .",
    "as explained before , this limit corresponds to taking into account only a neighborhood of the singularity , so that supergravity effects are negligible .",
    "solutions to these equations may be viewed in two equivalent ways .",
    "if we want to stabilize at a particular point in the moduli space , @xmath123 is an on - shell condition that restricts the possible values of the fluxes to a subspace . indeed , since @xmath124 gives by construction a basis of @xmath125 , @xmath126 implies that @xmath127 on the other hand , a holomorphic differential is uniquely specified by giving its @xmath128-periods .",
    "indeed , the @xmath22-periods are then functions of the period matrix : @xmath129    the other possible point of view is that we can turn on arbitrary fluxes through all the cycles ; this will lift almost all the degeneracy of the @xmath130 supersymmetric moduli space , leaving only some number of @xmath0 supersymmetric vacua .",
    "therefore , if we specify arbitrarily both the @xmath128 and @xmath22 fluxes , ( [ eq : tonshell2 ] ) stabilizes the complex moduli of the curve : @xmath131    the ingredient that makes the number of vacua finite in compact calabi - yau manifolds is the tadpole cancellation condition  @xcite .",
    "there is no such constraint in the noncompact case , since the flux can go off to infinity .",
    "however , the fluxes can not be arbitrarily large , because once their associated energy is of order @xmath132 , the noncompact approximation breaks down : our local variety will be mixed with far away cycles in the cy .",
    "therefore , in counting the total number of vacua , we have to impose by hand a tadpole condition . by analogy with the compact case  @xcite , we require that @xmath133 using the on - shell formula ( [ eq : tonshell1 ] ) and recalling ( [ eq : metric ] ) , the tadpole condition becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath136 is the maximum value of @xmath137 , fixed by data of the compact cy that we choose to embed ( [ eq : cy2 ] ) .",
    "from ( [ eq : tadpole1a ] ) , the counting of supersymmetric vacua may be rephrased in terms of the geometry of @xmath2 : over each point @xmath138 in moduli space we have a ` solid sphere ' @xmath139 , with volume @xmath136 .",
    "each of these allowed points determines a point in flux space ; the number of such points will give the number of supersymmetric vacua .",
    "furthermore , ( [ eq : tadpole1a ] ) shows why degeneration limits may produce an infinite number of vacua : if @xmath140 develops a null direction , the tadpole condition will not bound the number of flux points . in other words , from this analysis it is not clear how configurations where one flux goes to infinity and another goes to minus infinity , in a correlated way such that @xmath141 stays finite , will be ruled out .",
    "the gauge theory analysis will shed light on this point .",
    "finally , even with the tadpole condition , the number of solutions to the equations of motion ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) with continuous fluxes @xmath96 will be infinite .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple way out of this problem .",
    "recall that the noncompact hyperelliptic curve should be considered as part of a compact cy .",
    "instead of parametrizing the fluxes with arbitrary energy scales @xmath97 , we take them to be integers . then ( [ eq : renormgeom ] ) will _ fix _ the energy scales at particular values , depending on the fluxes .",
    "this approach was also taken in  @xcite to study the consequences of the klebanov - strassler solution  @xcite and leads to the usual exponentially large hierarchies of energy scales , as we show later .",
    "now we have all the elements to count vacua on complex curves with punctures ; the derivation of the formula for the density of vacua continues as in @xcite : the number of supersymmetric vacua is given by @xmath142 @xmath143 with @xmath144 here , @xmath145 because of @xmath146 , we can replace @xmath147 in ( [ eq : matrixd2w ] ) .",
    "the main simplification in the noncompact case is that , since @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and then @xmath150 therefore _ the number of supersymmetric vacua coincides with the supersymmetry index _ , which is topological and , as we shall see , much easier to compute . on the contrary , in the compact case , when gravity is not decoupled , the supersymmetric index gives just a lower bound to the number of vacua .",
    "the final result is @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "as expected , this coincides with @xcite when @xmath4 . the index @xmath153 is introduced for clarity reasons , to mean that this is the result from the closed string side .",
    "in this section we construct the supersymmetric gauge theory which is dual to the previous gravity configuration .",
    "the analysis will be done along the lines of the dijkgraaf - vafa ( dv ) correspondence , based on geometric transitions connecting open and closed superstrings .",
    "however our situation is more general and will require additional techniques .",
    "let us first quickly review the dv case , which corresponds to the flux subspace @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 for all @xmath157 .",
    "the large n duality between open / closed topological strings was derived in  @xcite .",
    "the role of the holomorphic matrix model and the relation to @xmath0 sym was considered in  @xcite . on the other hand , in  @xcite the dv relation",
    "was derived purely from the field theory side , using the chiral ring relations and the konishi anomaly .",
    "close to the semiclassical limit @xmath158 , @xmath159 , the geometry ( [ eq : cy2 ] ) corresponds to a product of @xmath7 independent deformed conifolds .",
    "they are cones over @xmath160 and , while the @xmath73s are collapsed to zero , the @xmath161s have finite size as measured by @xmath162 . in the geometric transition the @xmath7 3-spheres @xmath18 are collapsed and we blow - up the conifolds at @xmath21 by introducing @xmath7 @xmath163 s",
    ". then the @xmath164 fluxes @xmath165 will disappear and , instead , we will have @xmath165 d5 branes wrapping the corresponding @xmath163s . the dv correspondence states that the large @xmath166 limit of the closed string theory on the deformed threefold is equivalent to the open string theory on the resolved threefold , with the previous relation between rr fluxes and d5 branes .",
    "@xmath167 plays the role of a tree - level superpotential for the chiral superfield @xmath168 in the @xmath130 vector multiplet of a pure @xmath169 sym ; this potential breaks @xmath130 to @xmath0 .",
    "classically , the number of vacua is given by the number of ways of choosing @xmath165 eigenvalues of @xmath168 equal to @xmath14 , with @xmath170 .",
