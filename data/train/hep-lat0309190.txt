    "in this note we will describe some of the properties of a @xmath0 symmetric generalization of dimensional reduction , applied to @xmath1 gauge theory in @xmath2 dimension .",
    "the motivation is to construct an effective action , which is constrained by perturbative dimensional reduction at high temperature , but which can be applied all the way down to the confinement phase transition .",
    "the partition function is defined as follows : @xmath3\\text{d}[v]\\exp\\bigl(-s_{eff}\\bigr)\\\\ s_{eff}&=s_u+s_{u , v}+s_v \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath4 the @xmath1 matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined on the sites and the links respectively of a two dimensional lattice .",
    "the matrices @xmath7 represent the polyakov loops of the full @xmath8 theory .",
    "similar models have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the phase structure of the above model , and compare with results obtained within the standard reduction recipes @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we set @xmath9 and discuss the phase structure in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "the number @xmath11 of time slices in ( 2 + 1)d , which enters as a parameter in @xmath12 is fixed to 4 throughout this paper .",
    "the model was studied using conventional lattice qcd monte - carlo techniques .",
    "the multi hit metropolis algorithm was used both for updating the gauge fields @xmath13 and polyakov loops fields @xmath7 .",
    "lattices of sizes ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 were studied .",
    "the main quantities measured were the traces of polyakov loops @xmath16 and their two  point correlators .",
    "we started with simulations at @xmath17 for a range of @xmath18 values and got the expected signal of the phase transition between the low - temperature confined @xmath19 symmetric phase ( ia ) and a broken high temperature phase ( ii ) .",
    "screening masses @xmath20 were obtained by fitting the two point polyakov loop unconnected correlators with the formula @xmath21 we plot the result of the fit in figure  [ fig : massnp ] . on the same plot",
    "we show the results obtained in @xcite with the naively reduced model ( no higgs potential ) . at sufficiently large temperature ( large @xmath18 ) the agreement is good , but the @xmath0 symmetric model also describes the vanishing of the screening mass associated with @xmath0 restoration at lower temperatures .",
    "we then performed a series of scans in the @xmath18@xmath23 plane on @xmath14 lattices and looked for peaks in the susceptibility @xmath24 as indications of phase transitions , while the associated distributions of @xmath25 were used to characterize the phases .",
    "after so identifying a tentative phase diagram ( see figure  [ fig : pd ] ) ,          one sees a strong transition signal just above @xmath27 . there the size dependence of @xmath28 at its maximum , as well as the time history of @xmath29 and its doubly peaked histogram clearly indicate that the transition is first order .",
    "the evidence for a second phase transition , slightly above @xmath30 is considerably weaker .",
    "the peak is less pronounced and we had to go to @xmath15 lattices ( with much poorer statistics ) to make sure that it grows with the lattice size . in order to study the nature of the phases , we looked at the distributions of the polyakov loops @xmath25 .",
    "the regions marked ia and ii on figure  [ fig : pd ] are easily identified with standard @xmath19 symmetric and broken phases , with data concentrated respectively around @xmath31 and @xmath32 . at larger @xmath23 in region iii ,",
    "a new pattern shows up , with again @xmath0 breaking peaks , but the argument of @xmath25 is now close to @xmath33 , as illustrated on figure  [ fig : hist ] . finally ,",
    "when @xmath23 is further increased ( region ib ) , the histogram is located around @xmath34 , no particular argument is selected , and we conjecture that the phase is the same as the low temperature confined one ( ia ) .",
    "along @xmath26 , we have used the projected ( 0momentum ) correlators to extract the masses , by fitting them to the formula  : @xmath37 our results are summarized in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "the mass value is found to coincide with that measured at @xmath26 , @xmath38 in the original(2 + 1 ) model @xcite for @xmath23 close to 0.2 .",
    "this point in parameter space is a stable point of the phase diagram , at variance with what happens in the conventionally reduced model , where the physical situation corresponds to a metastable point @xcite .      in conclusion ,",
    "the @xmath0 symmetric model opens a possibility to extend dimensional reduction down to the temperature where confinement is restored .",
    "it exhibits an interesting phase diagram , with a new phase whose connection to qcd at finite temperature and/or chemical potential should be investigated . for this purpose ,",
    "a study to constrain the model parameters is under way .",
