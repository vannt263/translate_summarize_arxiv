    "d - branes @xcite have recently emerged as a key ingredient driving the non - perturbative dynamics of string theory .",
    "these objects provide an exact description of string theory solitons , and have led to remarkable developments towards understanding the nature of stringy black holes @xcite .",
    "d - branes also provide a fascinating connection between string theory and gauge theories .",
    "the low - energy effective dynamics of @xmath0 parallel d - branes is precisely that of supersymmetric yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath1 @xcite ; such a low - energy effective theory has in turn been conjectured to provide a reformulation of string theory itself @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend further the range of phenomena in d - brane physics which can be described precisely in the language of yang - mills field theory or its extension to born - infeld theory . in particular , we consider the correspondence between the perturbative fluctuation spectra of d - brane configurations wrapped on a torus and gauge theories with a constant background field on the dual torus .",
    "constant background field configurations in yang - mills theory on the torus are t - dual to d - branes which are either diagonally wrapped ( `` tilted '' ) @xcite or intersecting at an angle @xcite .",
    "related recent work on branes at an angle can be found in @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation spectra of gauge theories in a constant background field have been investigated previously in @xcite .",
    "we compare these results to what is expected from the d - brane side .",
    "the constant background field strength in the yang - mills theory gives rise to a new scale in the problem in addition to the string scale and the radius of the torus . in an appropriate scaling limit",
    ", we show that yang - mills theory is insufficient to reproduce the spectrum of open strings on the d - branes and must be replaced by the full born - infeld action .",
    "we find that in many cases the full born - infeld action reproduces in a field theory context the exact spectrum of low - energy string excitations around the d - brane background .",
    "the story is slightly more subtle in the non - abelian case .",
    "the excitation spectra for intersecting d - branes and the corresponding dual gauge fields were discussed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "however , these spectra agree only to lowest order in the angle of intersection .",
    "we investigate the resolution of this discrepancy by including higher order terms in the non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "although the non - abelian generalization of the born - infeld action has yet to be understood in full , a formulation involving a symmetrized trace was proposed recently by tseytlin @xcite .",
    "we find that this prescription for non - abelian born - infeld fails to reproduce the exact fluctuation spectrum seen in string theory .",
    "nonetheless , we encounter remarkable relations encoded in the general structure of tseytlin s non - abelian born - infeld action which provide a hint indicating how this discrepancy might ultimately be resolved . since the relation which emerges from the analysis of the action is highly non - trivial , we believe that there is a strong element of truth in tseytlin s proposal",
    ". however , we do not completely resolve the discrepancy at finite angles , and we leave this as a problem for future investigations .    a particularly interesting class of systems of the type considered here are those corresponding to non - supersymmetric d - brane configurations .",
    "on @xmath2 constant gauge field backgrounds are stable if and only if the gauge field is ( anti)-self - dual . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the ( anti)-self - dual condition is equivalent to the condition that the dual d - brane configuration preserve enough supersymmetry to be a bps state .",
    "considering non - supersymmetric d - brane configurations , we find that the tachyonic instability of the string ground state appears naturally in the field theory language as an instability of a saddle point configuration in the yang - mills / born - infeld theory .",
    "this provides a natural framework for studying aspects of brane - anti - brane interactions in the context of field theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we consider d - brane configurations which are tilted with respect to the torus ; these configurations correspond to gauge theory backgrounds with constant field strengths in the central @xmath3 part of @xmath1 .",
    "the necessity for replacing the yang - mills action with the born - infeld action in order to exactly reproduce the fluctuation spectrum emerges from this analysis .",
    "we also discuss the issue of fractional quantization from the gauge theory point of view in this section . in section 3",
    "we consider systems of intersecting d - branes which correspond to reducible connections in the dual gauge theory .",
    "we discuss the discrepancy between the spectra and its possible resolution by the non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "we also discuss here the d - brane / born - infeld correspondence for non - supersymmetric d - brane configurations and the associated tachyonic instability .",
    "we begin with a brief review of some salient features of d - branes and their behavior under t - duality ; for more background see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with d - branes in type ii string theory . in type iia ( iib )",
    "string theory , d - branes with even ( odd ) dimension appear .",
    "when the theory is compactified on a torus @xmath4 there is a t - duality symmetry in each compactified direction which exchanges neumann and dirichlet string boundary conditions and which therefore changes the dimension of a d - brane by one .",
    "the dynamics of a single d - brane are controlled by the born - infeld action , which reduces in the case of small field strength and flat background metric to a supersymmetric @xmath3 yang - mills action with adjoint scalars corresponding to transverse fluctuations @xcite . when @xmath0 d - branes become coincident , the yang - mills action is extended to a supersymmetric non - abelian @xmath1 yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the full born - infeld action to the non - abelian case has not yet been completely understood ; however , recent progress in this direction was made by tseytlin @xcite .",
    "when d - branes are living in a space which has been compactified in a transverse direction , there are winding strings which wrap around the compactified direction an arbitrary number of times .",
    "under t - duality , string winding and string momentum are exchanged so that these winding strings naturally become momentum modes of the gauge field under duality in the compact direction . at the level of the yang - mills action",
    ", this duality can be made manifest .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the winding strings can be packaged in an infinite matrix which corresponds to the operator @xmath5 in the dual gauge theory . under this correspondence , the fluctuation spectrum of strings on a d - brane which is unwrapped in some set of compact dimensions",
    "is precisely captured by the dual gauge theory .    when we consider d - branes which are not parallel to the generators of a perpendicular torus , however , or systems of intersecting d - branes , we must be more careful .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that nontrivial gauge configurations can carry d - brane charge .",
    "this follows from the chern - simons term in the d - brane action which couples higher powers of the gauge field strength @xmath6 to rr fields .",
    "when we have a system of tilted or intersecting d - branes on a torus , t - dualizing to a gauge theory on the torus will generally lead to a topologically nontrivial bundle whose chern classes determine the d - brane charges on various subtori .",
    "such bundles were discussed in the @xmath7 case in @xcite , and in the context of d - branes in @xcite .",
    "the approach we will take in this paper is to consider fixed configurations of flat d - branes on the torus which may be tilted or intersecting .",
    "these d - brane configurations map under t - duality to constant field strength backgrounds in the dual gauge theory .",
    "we will compare the fluctuation spectra of the d - brane configurations as calculated in string theory to the fluctuation spectra of the gauge fields around the constant background .",
    "as we shall see , in many situations the action must be generalized to the full non - abelian born - infeld action to achieve an exact correspondence between these two spectra .",
    "let us begin with the simplest example of a gauge field configuration corresponding to the t - dual of a tilted d - brane . consider a 2-brane wrapped on @xmath8 with periods @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the fluctuation spectrum of this theory is precisely that of susy @xmath3 yang - mills theory in 2 + 1 dimensions around a vanishing background field .",
    "there are gauge fields corresponding to the regular bosonic @xmath3 theory , adjoint scalars corresponding to transverse fluctuations , and various fermionic fields . throughout this paper",
    "we will restrict attention to the fluctuation spectra of the bosonic modes , although a similar analysis could easily be performed for the fermion modes .",
    "consider turning on a background @xmath12 the flux quantization condition requires that @xmath13 be an integer multiple of the flux quantum : @xmath14 such a configuration corresponds to a @xmath3 bundle with first chern class @xmath15 . for concreteness ,",
    "let us take @xmath16 .",
    "from the point of view of @xmath3 gauge theory , it is straightforward to compute the spectrum of fluctuations around this background . in terms of the fluctuation @xmath17 defined through @xmath18",
    "the lagrangian is simply ( up to an overall constant ) @xmath19 we can ignore the additive constant and the total derivative terms , so one recovers the original yang - mills lagrangian @xmath20 whose physical spectrum is simply that of the quantized momenta @xmath21 the spectrum for the transverse bosonic fields is clearly the same , as they obey the same periodic boundary conditions .",
    "let us now consider the d - brane configuration given after t - duality in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "in the gauge theory configuration described above , we have a single unit of 2-brane charge corresponding to the @xmath3 gauge group .",
    "the flux @xmath13 carries a single unit of 0-brane charge . under t - duality",
    ", we get a d - brane configuration with one unit of 1-brane charge in each direction @xmath23 .",
    "t - duality inverts the radius of the torus along the @xmath22 direction , so the dimensions of the dual torus are @xmath24 .",
    "the background field given by ( [ background ] ) can be interpreted under t - duality as the transverse coordinate of a 1-brane on @xmath25 , @xmath26 this shows that the 1-brane is wound diagonally on the dual torus , as expected of a ( 1 , 1 ) bound state ( see figure [ tilt1 ] ) .",
    "the field theory limit of this configuration corresponds to taking @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be of the same order of magnitude while sending @xmath27 to zero . in this limit ,",
    "the dual torus becomes long and thin .",
    "the low - lying states in the t - dual description are therefore given by momentum modes along the 1-brane and winding modes in the direction perpendicular to the 1-brane .",
    "the winding modes can also be thought of as strings stretching between adjacent 1-branes in the covering space of the dual torus . from the point of view of string theory in a background given by such a d - brane configuration",
    ", we expect the spectrum of low - lying excitations to be given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the length of the 1-brane along the diagonal @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the distance between adjacent 1-branes @xmath32 in terms of the original variables , ( [ tmpspec ] ) becomes @xmath33 comparison of eq .",
    "( [ gaugespec ] ) and ( [ dbranespec ] ) indicates that they disagree by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "we will now show that the spectrum of excited states arising from the born - infeld action in 2 + 1 dimensions gives rise to the correct factor of @xmath35 , correcting ( [ gaugespec ] ) to precisely match the string theory result found in equation ( [ dbranespec ] ) .",
    "the born - infeld action in 2 + 1 dimensions is given by ( up to an overall constant ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the minkowski metric @xmath38 , which will henceforth be used to raise and lower the lorentz indices .",
    "just as in the case of the original yang - mills theory , the dynamics of small fluctuations is described by expanding the action around a fixed background .",
    "substituting @xmath39 into ( [ born - infeld ] ) and expanding to quadratic order in @xmath17 , one finds that up to an overall scaling factor the quadratic term in the action is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fluctuation .",
    "it will be convenient to separate @xmath42 into its symmetric and antisymmetric components : @xmath43 using this decomposition and ignoring the overall factor of @xmath44 , the action takes the form @xmath45 further computation shows that the terms containing @xmath46 vanish , and @xmath47 is a diagonal matrix @xmath48 with @xmath49 compared to the dynamics of small fluctuations in yang - mills theory given by equation ( [ original ] ) , the born - infeld action has effectively rescaled the spatial coordinates by a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "this properly rescales the spectrum of the momentum modes so that there is a precise agreement with the spectrum of low - lying open string states ( [ dbranespec ] ) seen from the d - brane point of view .",
    "this exercise of establishing the necessity for considering the born - infeld action over the yang - mills action in order to exactly match the string theory spectrum might seem purely academic in light of the fact that in the field theory limit @xmath51 goes to zero and the factor in question , @xmath52 , is identically 1 to leading order in @xmath27 .",
    "however , there is a way to take a field theory limit keeping @xmath51 constant .",
    "consider the same background as before @xmath53 with @xmath54 not equal to 1 . from the d - brane point of view",
    ", this corresponds to a 1-brane with wrapping number @xmath55 .",
    "( see figure [ tilt2 ] . )",
    "again , we expect the spectrum to be given by ( [ tmpspec ] ) , and just as before , we obtain @xmath56 now , we can take the field theory limit by keeping @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath57 constant and sending @xmath54 to infinity .",
    "this time , the difference between born - infeld and yang - mills theory is non - trivial even at leading order in @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the born - infeld action captures the dual string spectrum more correctly than yang - mills theory is very natural in light of the fact that the dynamics on the world - volume of a d - brane is indeed described by the born - infeld action and yang - mills theory is only its leading approximation in the field theory limit for a fixed background .",
    "in fact , the same type of system as the one we have discussed in this section was analyzed in @xcite from the point of view of string theory in a background gauge field , giving essentially the same results .",
    "the interesting point about this type of configuration is that by scaling the background as above it is possible to retain the structure of born - infeld dynamics even in the field theory limit .",
    "the extra terms arising from the born - infeld action are usually subleading in the @xmath58 expansion and are associated with the non - locality of string theory .",
    "we can in fact see that the winding strings of minimum length attached to the tilted branes are not local objects from the world - volume observer s point of view , as is illustrated in figure [ nonlocal ] .",
    "the results from this section indicate that it is possible to enhance the non - locality of string theory even in the field theory limit by scaling up the background field strength . in the presence of such a background , the interaction terms in the born - infeld action",
    "will induce a mass shift in the spectrum of excited states to precisely reproduce the string theory spectrum .      in the previous subsection we considered only configurations with a single 2-brane in the gauge theory picture , and all our analysis",
    "was done in the context of the abelian born - infeld action . in this subsection",
    "we discuss a more general configuration which is t - dual to a d1-brane on @xmath8 with wrapping numbers @xmath60 with @xmath61 relatively prime .",
    "to describe such a configuration we need to define a @xmath62 bundle over @xmath8 whose connections have total flux @xmath63 .",
    "the flux is quantized in units of @xmath64 since the gauge group is @xmath65 .",
    "we can describe a @xmath62 bundle in the fundamental representation by giving the boundary overlap functions for sections @xmath66 the condition that these boundary conditions give a well - defined @xmath62 bundle is @xmath67 to have a total flux of @xmath63 we can decompose these boundary conditions into abelian and non - abelian components .",
    "the abelian component should have flux @xmath63 , while the non - abelian component should have an t hooft @xcite twist giving a flux @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "a standard choice of gauge for defining a bundle of this type is to pick @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the diagonal and shift matrices @xmath74 choosing this set of boundary conditions , however , complicates the discussion of t - duality in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "we will therefore instead choose the boundary conditions @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the diagonal matrix @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the integral part of @xmath79 , and where the multiplicities of the diagonal elements of @xmath76 are @xmath80 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "since @xmath76 has integral diagonal elements , we have @xmath81 so ( [ eq : bundlecondition ] ) is clearly satisfied .",
    "the abelian part of @xmath76 is just @xmath82 so this bundle has the correct flux .",
    "since the boundary conditions are trivial in the @xmath22 direction , we can discuss t - duality in this direction without encountering undue complications .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath83 on this bundle will satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath84 the adjoint scalar fields @xmath85 will satisfy the same boundary conditions as @xmath86 .",
    "the constant curvature background corresponding to these boundary conditions is @xmath87 where @xmath88 the t - dual along @xmath22 gives rise to the type of d1-brane configuration illustrated in figure [ tilt3 ] , with @xmath89    it is straightforward to derive the spectrum of open strings around this d - brane background : @xmath90 in order to reproduce this spectrum in field theory , we need the non - abelian generalization of the born - infeld action .",
    "although there are some ambiguities in defining the non - abelian born - infeld action , a procedure for defining this action was recently proposed by tseytlin in @xcite . in the following , we will simply follow this proposal , which gives an action of the form @xmath91 where `` str '' indicates that the trace is to be taken after we symmetrize all the non - commuting products .",
    "our analysis is simplified drastically by the fact that the background gauge field is proportional to the identity and commutes with everything . expanding the non - abelian born - infeld action to second order will therefore lead to @xmath92 \\label{abelian}\\ ] ] with the same @xmath47 we encountered previously .",
    "just as in the previous case , we see that the effect of including the correction arising from the full born - infeld type interaction is the rescaling of the spectrum by a factor of @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we have a spectrum given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the eigenvalue of the covariant derivative operator @xmath96 acting on the modes satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bcond ] ) . due to the twisting in the boundary conditions ,",
    "the quantization conditions of these modes are complicated slightly , and the @xmath97-fold degeneracy corresponding to the number of independent components of matrices in the adjoint of @xmath1 is lifted .",
    "let us now consider the effects of the boundary conditions on the periodicity of the various modes .",
    "the inhomogeneous term in the boundary condition for @xmath98 does not affect the periodicity structure of the fluctuation modes since it is taken care of by the background field . thus , the fluctuation spectrum will be the same for each of the gauge fields and the transverse scalars .",
    "each of these fields is described by a matrix containing @xmath97 elements .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the homogeneous part of the boundary condition ( [ bcond ] ) is satisfied by modes given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a @xmath101 matrix @xmath102 where @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ bcond ] ) further implies that @xmath105 indicating that @xmath106 takes on values quantized in units of @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath108 vanishes , the covariant derivative in the @xmath25 direction is simply the partial derivative , and it follows that @xmath109    the boundary condition in the @xmath22 direction is trivial , indicating that @xmath110 . due to the presence of the background , however , the covariant derivative is modified by the commutator term .",
    "one finds that @xmath111 = \\frac{2 \\pi}{l_2}\\left(m_2-\\frac{r}{p}\\right ) \\delta a ( x_1,x_2).\\ ] ] since @xmath112 could be any integer between 0 and @xmath113 , we find that @xmath114 is also quantized in units of @xmath107 : @xmath115    thus , in general we find that the @xmath97 degrees of freedom in the matrix appear as modes with momentum quantized in units of @xmath107 in both the @xmath25 and @xmath22 directions . substituting the expressions for @xmath116 and @xmath114 in equations ( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) back into the spectrum ( [ back ] ) , we recover @xmath117 in agreement with the string theory answer .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fractional quantization of momentum in the @xmath25 direction appears naturally as a periodicity on a @xmath118-fold covering , whereas the fractional quantization in the @xmath22 direction appears because there are @xmath118 different `` types '' of excitations , labeled by which diagonal of the matrix they appear in .",
    "these two distinct mechanisms for fractional quantization correspond naturally to the string geometry in the d - brane picture , where the @xmath25 excitations correspond to momentum on a @xmath118-fold wrapped brane while the @xmath22 excitations correspond to strings connecting branes separated by a distance proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "this explicit construction in the context of gauge theory gives an interesting point of view on fractional momentum states , which have been considered in a number of contexts@xcite .",
    "there is a close correspondence between this discussion and the description of fractional momentum states as arising from the twisted sector in an orbifold by the center of the gauge group @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we examined the d - brane / gauge theory correspondence for tilted d - branes , corresponding to a gauge theory background in the central @xmath3 of @xmath1 . in this section ,",
    "we examine systems of intersecting d - branes which correspond to constant curvature backgrounds with reducible connections .",
    "when the constant background field can be expressed in terms of a background connection @xmath120 with components which all commute , the t - dual system corresponds to a system of intersecting branes with well - defined positions . for concreteness",
    ", we will concentrate on systems corresponding to gauge theories with @xmath121 .",
    "the constant curvature @xmath122 backgrounds which describe dual configurations of intersecting d - branes are precisely those background fields which can be described in terms of reducible connections .",
    "thus , in the gauge theory language , we will be considering connections which decompose as a direct sum of @xmath3 connections .",
    "this restriction simplifies the analysis somewhat .",
    "a complete classification of constant curvature connections on @xmath123 bundles over @xmath2 was given by van baal in @xcite ; in this work he also calculated the yang - mills fluctuation spectra around these backgrounds .",
    "in the d - brane language , the corresponding backgrounds describe a pair of branes intersecting at angles ; the spectrum of low - lying open strings in such backgrounds have been studied in @xcite .",
    "although the spectra computed in @xcite and @xcite have striking qualitative similarities , they are distinct in certain details . we will investigate the possibility of resolving this discrepancy by considering the full non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "we also discuss the dynamics of non - supersymmetric backgrounds .",
    "we begin our discussion by reviewing the d - brane construction of @xcite .",
    "one of the main points made in @xcite is the fact that there exist supersymmetric configurations of branes intersecting at angles .",
    "here , we consider a general class of configurations of intersecting branes which includes non - supersymmetric brane configurations .",
    "the configurations we are interested in correspond to intersecting d - branes living on tori .",
    "as discussed above , these configurations are dual to gauge theory backgrounds with reducible connections",
    ". we will here restrict attention to pairs of intersecting branes , concentrating in particular on the case of two 2-branes on @xmath2 .",
    "there are several kinds of string excitations around such a background .",
    "there are strings which stretch from each of the two 2-branes back to itself .",
    "these strings carry momentum and winding numbers .",
    "these excitations correspond to modes living in one of the reducible components of the dual bundle and are essentially equivalent to those discussed in the previous section .",
    "thus , we will not consider these modes further here but will concentrate on the strings connecting the two different branes . unlike the strings connecting a brane to itself , the strings connecting the different branes are unaffected by the compactification of the space in which the branes are living .",
    "this can be seen by going to the covering space , where all strings connecting the two branes are homotopically connected ( as long as they are associated with the same intersection point ) .",
    "of course , at higher order there are diagrams connecting these strings with winding strings connecting a brane to itself",
    ". however , these diagrams will not affect the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "thus , to understand the fluctuation spectrum of the strings connecting the distinct 2-branes , it is sufficient to understand the spectrum of strings connecting two 2-branes in noncompact space .",
    "this is precisely the situation considered in @xcite , and we recapitulate their discussion here with the additional feature that we do not insist on the supersymmetry of the d - brane configuration .    a sufficiently general configuration of two 2-branes in @xmath124 can be defined by beginning with two 2-branes oriented along the 14 axis , and rotating one of them by an angle @xmath125 in the 12 plane and by an angle @xmath126 in the 34 plane . for @xmath127 ,",
    "this configuration was shown to be supersymmetric in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we use complex coordinates @xmath128 and @xmath129 instead of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .    in world - sheet language ,",
    "strings stretching between the two branes are described by open strings with boundary conditions @xmath132 the mode expansion for the complex bosonic field is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the vacuum energy @xmath136 can be computed either from the @xmath137-function regularization of the sum @xmath138 or from the dimensions of the world sheet operators needed to twist the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the low - lying open string excitations in the ns sector described in equation ( 3.5 ) of @xcite generalize to @xmath139 and their contribution to the masses are , respectively , @xmath140 this gives a complete characterization of the fluctuation spectra of strings stretching between two 2-branes at angles @xmath141 , including cases where the brane configuration is not bps .",
    "note that when @xmath142 the spectrum contains a tachyon .      we will now discuss a gauge theory configuration whose dual corresponds to two 2-branes on @xmath2 . as stated",
    ", we will restrict attention to @xmath122 bundles with connections which are reducible to a direct sum of two @xmath3 connections .",
    "the discussion could be generalized in a straightforward way to arbitrary reducible @xmath1 bundles .",
    "it was pointed out by t hooft @xcite that for @xmath143 there are constant curvature connections which do not satisfy abelian boundary conditions ; these correspond to d - brane configurations with fewer than @xmath0 d - branes , with some of the d - branes wrapped multiple times around the base space as in section [ sec : pq ] .",
    "we will consider here a constant background field given by a @xmath122 connection @xmath144 on @xmath2 with the following components @xmath145 where @xmath146 are the dimensions of the 4-torus and @xmath147 is an anti - selfdual matrix with with @xmath148 and zero otherwise .",
    "@xmath149 is the su(2 ) generator @xmath150 .",
    "this configuration has an instanton number @xcite .",
    "@xmath151 because the field strength is proportional to @xmath149 the first chern class vanishes .",
    "thus , this configuration corresponds to a ( singular ) point in the moduli space of @xmath122 instantons on @xmath2 with instanton number @xmath152 .",

    "@xmath160 and @xmath161 are real and complex fields respectively ; in @xmath123 , we would have @xmath162 .",

    "the action , expressed in these variables , takes the form @xmath164 with @xmath165 as discussed in section [ branes.at.angles ] , the fields @xmath166 correspond to strings in the dual picture connecting a brane with itself , and have spectra corresponding to the discussion in section [ sec : tilted ] .",
    "thus , we concentrate now on the spectrum for the field @xmath167 corresponding to strings stretching between the two branes . the computation of this spectrum is described in detail in @xcite , so we simply summarize the results of that investigation here . the boundary conditions on @xmath167 indicate that it is a theta function on @xmath2 .",
    "the operator @xmath168 acts on the appropriate space of theta functions as a laplace - beltrami operator up to a constant .",
    "the eigenfunctions of this operator were classified in @xcite , and are given by a sum over the lattice of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions rotated by linear phases .",
    "the low - lying eigenfunctions are localized in the vicinity of the string intersection points .",
    "we will discuss a specific example of such eigenfunctions more explicitly in section [ sec : unstable ] .",
    "the spectrum of eigenvalues for the four - dimensional system of interest here is given in equation ( 3.25 ) of @xcite : @xmath169 where @xmath170 we therefore see that the spectrum of fluctuations around this constant field strength background has precisely the structure of the oscillator excitations ( [ eq3 ] ) found from the string theory point of view in @xcite up to the identification @xmath171    thus , the fluctuation spectra computed from these two points of view agree up to a discrepancy between @xmath172 and @xmath173 . for small @xmath174 these spectra",
    "agree exactly .",
    "the difference in the spectra resulting from the discrepancy between @xmath172 and @xmath175 might seem minor in light of the fact that they are in perfect agreement at small angles , and that in the field theory limit keeping the background constant , @xmath174 goes to zero .",
    "however , just as in section [ sec : tilted ] , one can take a field theory limit while scaling the background to keep @xmath174 finite but small compared to 1 . to be more specific",
    ", we can consider the background @xmath176 and take the limit @xmath177 keeping the ratios of @xmath146 s and @xmath178 constant .",
    "after a gauge transformation to set @xmath179 , this will lead in the t - dual picture to 2-branes wrapping multiply around the 23 cycles as illustrated in figure [ inter2 ] .",
    "we saw in section [ sec : tilted ] that scaling the field strength enhances the terms ordinarily subleading in @xmath58 and that the full born - infeld action was needed to recover the exact correspondence in the case of tilted branes .",
    "it is therefore natural to suspect that the same mechanism underlies the resolution of the @xmath172 vs.@xmath180 discrepancy .",
    "we investigate this possibility in this subsection .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the fact that the background field does not commute with all fluctuations .",
    "the field theory analysis therefore depends on the full structure of the non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "recently , a concrete formulation of the non - abelian born - infeld action was proposed by tseytlin @xcite .",
    "using tseytlin s born - infeld action , we compute the spectrum of fluctuations around the same background as was considered in the previous subsection .",
    "a remarkable relation emerges in the analysis , bringing the field theory spectrum tantalizingly close to the string theory spectrum of section [ branes.at.angles ] .",
    "however , we fall slightly short of reproducing the string theory spectrum in its entirety .",
    "we interpret this situation in the following manner : due to the highly non - trivial nature of the partial success in resolving the @xmath172 vs.  @xmath175 discrepancy , there must be a strong element of truth in tseytlin s formulation of the non - abelian born - infeld action , but in as much as it fails to reproduce the string theory spectrum precisely , it is still in some sense incomplete .",
    "reformulating the born - infeld action to resolve this discrepancy is likely to be a rather tricky enterprise .",
    "nonetheless , we feel that reproducing the spectrum of a system of d - branes intersecting at an angle will serve as a useful test and could possibly be used as a guiding principle in formulating the elusive non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "the key feature of tseytlin s non - abelian born - infeld action is its resolution of product ordering ambiguities through symmetrization @xmath181 our strategy here is to perform formal manipulations of quantities inside the symmetric trace as if they were abelian . at the last stage of the analysis",
    ", we will re - insert the non - commuting factors and perform the symmetrized trace , thereby promoting the abelianized action back up to its original non - abelian counterpart . in our analysis we consider the symmetrized trace term by term in an expansion with respect to the background as well as the fluctuation .",
    "for example , a term in the expansion corresponding to an abelianized expression , @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are in the adjoint of @xmath123 , is replaced by @xmath185 \\label{expansion}\\ ] ] upon reinsertion of non - commuting factors .",
    "let us consider in particular the case where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are restricted to the range of values @xmath188 .",
    "simple algebraic manipulations of the pauli matrices show that @xmath189 at this point , it is convenient to consider the cases of @xmath190 even and @xmath190 odd separately .",
    "for @xmath190 odd , @xmath191 whereas for @xmath190 even , @xmath192 therefore , if in the abelian born - infeld action the terms quadratic in fluctuations had an expansion consisting solely of terms with even powers in the background : @xmath193 then its non - abelian generalization for @xmath194 and @xmath195 fields will give rise to an expansion of the form @xmath196 these two expansions are related by @xmath197    the goal at this point is to examine the fluctuations of @xmath198 in a background defined by @xmath199 and @xmath200 -i [ a^0_\\mu,\\delta a_\\nu ] -i [ \\delta a_\\mu ,    \\delta a_\\nu]\\ ] ] we expand the action to quadratic order using the standard identity @xmath201 + \\frac{1}{8 } ( { { \\rm tr}}[m_0^{-1 } \\delta m])^2 - \\frac{1}{4 } { { \\rm tr}}[m_0^{-1 } \\delta m m_0^{-1 } \\delta m ] \\right)\\ ] ] in terms of our variables , the quadratic action reads @xmath202 \\label{quadaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now , @xmath203 with @xmath204 and @xmath205 -g^ f _ ^.@xmath206 the term linear in @xmath207 contributes at quadratic order because the commutator term in @xmath207 is quadratic in the fluctuations .",
    "this time , the terms quadratic in @xmath46 turn out not to vanish but give a topological contribution @xmath208 which can be ignored in the discussion of the fluctuation spectrum .    in order to compute the fluctuation spectrum",
    "we now must apply the integral prescription ( [ relation ] ) to the action in order to deal with the lack of commutativity between the fluctuations and the background .",
    "tseytlin s symmetrized trace prescription indicates that we should associate a single @xmath122 generator with each factor of the field strength @xmath6 .",
    "this gives a well - defined formulation of a non - abelian action . with this prescription ,",
    "the action as a function of the components of the field strength and its off - diagonal fluctuations should be computed by applying ( 20 ) to the terms quadratic in @xmath209 in ( 21 ) .",
    "the term linear in @xmath209 is not modified , since it is only nonzero when @xmath209 commutes with the background .",
    "unfortunately , this does not seem to give exactly the results that we would expect from string theory .",
    "nonetheless , there is some indication that this prescription comes close to doing the right thing . to see this",
    "let us consider a special case where the field strength is anti - self - dual , corresponding to a bps brane configuration .",
    "in this case we have @xmath210 . the determinant factor in the action",
    "gives a single factor of @xmath211 .",
    "this cancels with the @xmath212 factors in the terms quadratic in @xmath213 , so that the kinetic terms are canonically normalized .",
    "the potential terms quadratic in @xmath209 carry two factors of @xmath212 so that they are multiplied by an overall factor of @xmath214 compared to the pure yang - mills theory .    at this point",
    ", we encounter a pleasant surprise . applying the relation ( [ relation ] ) to the metric leads to @xmath215 this is precisely the rescaling necessary to match the field theory spectrum with the string theory result ! in fact , in this case we find that the spacing of the fluctuation spectrum corresponds precisely to that predicted by string theory .",
    "unfortunately , however , the energy of the lowest fluctuation is also affected by the term linear in @xmath209 .",
    "the factors of @xmath212 cancel in this term so that the calculation of standard yang - mills theory is not modified by the symmetrized trace form of the born - infeld action .",
    "thus , even in the special case where the field is anti - self - dual , we do not get exactly the spectrum predicted by string theory .",
    "we would expect that even in the more general case where the field is not anti - self - dual , the spectra computed from string theory and from the non - abelian born - infeld theory should agree . in the more general case , however , we find that even the spacing of the energy levels fails to be reproduced exactly by the symmetrized trace prescription .",
    "thus , it seems clear that this specific formulation of the non - abelian born - infeld theory is not sufficiently general to capture all the relevant physics of the situation we are considering here .",
    "there are several possible explanations for why the symmetrized trace prescription does not exactly match the string theory calculation .",
    "one possibility is that the association of a single generator to each factor of the field strength should be modified . as an example of this sort of modification",
    ", we might choose to normalize the fluctuations @xmath216 so that the kinetic terms in the action always have a canonical normalization .",
    "for cases where the field strength is not anti - self - dual this will incorporate extra factors into the potential terms .",
    "it can be shown that these extra terms guarantee that the scaling factor associated with the quadratic term in @xmath209 will give fluctuations with a level spacing precisely that predicted by string theory , as we showed above explicitly in the anti - self - dual case . unfortunately , however",
    ", it does not seem to be possible to arrange the normalization so that the linear term in @xmath209 also scales correctly .",
    "another possible reason why the symmetrized trace prescription does not reproduce the string theory results correctly is that covariant derivative terms @xmath217 or commutator terms @xmath218 $ ] may be relevant in this situation . in tseytlin",
    "s discussion of the non - abelian born - infeld action , terms of these forms were explicitly dropped .",
    "since the fluctuations we are concerned with here are theta functions which give nontrivial spatially dependent fluxes , it is quite possible that the effects of covariant derivative terms must be incorporated into the non - abelian born - infeld action in order to correctly reproduce the string theory results .",
    "a discussion of a related discrepancy was given in @xcite , where it was shown that it was necessary to add commutator and covariant derivative terms to the born - infeld action already at order @xmath219 to reproduce results from string theory .",
    "in any case , we do not have a complete understanding of why the prescription we have described corrects some , but not all , of the terms appearing in the action , and as such we have not provided a satisfactory resolution to the problem of the @xmath172 vs.  @xmath173 discrepancy . nonetheless , the relation between @xmath172 and @xmath175 is transcendental , and subtle details must work out just right in order for the correct transformation to emerge from this kind of analysis .",
    "the fact that one can naturally derive from the symmetrized trace prescription the precise scaling factor needed to achieve agreement with string theory seems to provide some evidence that there is an element of truth in this description .",
    "we believe that when it is correctly defined , the full non - abelian born - infeld action should resolve the discrepancy we have discussed here .",
    "we therefore pose the resolution of the @xmath172 vs.  @xmath173 discrepancy as a test which should be satisfied by any candidate for the full non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "we have discussed the correspondence between fluctuation spectra in a variety of situations corresponding to tilted and intersecting d - branes . as mentioned in section [ branes.at.angles ] , the formulae for the fluctuation spectra around intersecting d - branes extend to cases where the configuration of branes breaks supersymmetry . however , in such situations the state is no longer bps and generally admits a tachyonic instability @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we discuss the simplest example of such an instability in slightly more explicit terms .",
    "consider a pair of 1-branes wrapped on @xmath8 with winding numbers @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "these 1-branes intersect at two points .",
    "this configuration is unstable , since a simple change in the topology at one of the crossing points turns the configuration into a single 1-brane with winding @xmath222 ( see figure  [ f : unstable ] ) .",
    "we can understand this instability in the system from both the string theory and the yang - mills / born - infeld point of view . in the gauge theory picture",
    ", we have a pair of 2-branes on @xmath8 , one carrying a unit of 0-brane charge , and the other carrying a negative 0-brane charge , corresponding to a single anti-0-brane .",
    "thus , the tachyonic instability in this picture corresponds to the instability of a brane - anti - brane configuration .    to be specific , we will consider a @xmath122 gauge theory on a @xmath8 with sides of length @xmath223 .",
    "we will take the boundary conditions to be given by @xmath224 although these seem like nontrivial boundary conditions , they define a trivial @xmath122 bundle over @xmath8 in an unusual choice of gauge ; this gauge choice allows us to write the background connection in a form which manifestly corresponds to the desired t - dual d - brane configuration .",
    "the boundary conditions on the gauge fields are given by @xmath225 we will be considering the constant curvature background corresponding to the connection @xmath226 clearly , through t - duality this corresponds to a pair of 1-branes whose transverse positions are given by @xmath227 just as shown in figure  [ f : unstable ] .",
    "the tachyonic instability of this system is easy to see in the d - brane language .",
    "the string excitation spectrum is essentially given by ( [ eq3 ] ) where we set @xmath228 and where @xmath229 is related to the angle @xmath174 between the 1-branes by @xmath230 .",
    "as mentioned in section [ branes.at.angles ] , this spectrum contains a tachyon .",
    "we now discuss the instability of this system from the gauge theory point of view . as we have seen in previous sections ,",
    "the born - infeld action is necessary to get the precise normalization of the fluctuation spectra .",
    "however , the sign of the various fluctuations are not dependent upon such a precise calculation , so we should be able to detect the instability within the simple yang - mills framework . to find the unstable modes , we can use essentially the same analysis as that of van baal @xcite , simply setting to zero one of the two curvatures @xmath231 .",
    "we find that indeed there are modes with negative eigenvalues corresponding to unstable directions in the system .",
    "to describe these modes more precisely , let us consider the boundary conditions on the off - diagonal modes of the system .",
    "decomposing as above @xmath159 we find that each @xmath161 satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath232 these conditions imply that @xmath233 is a section of a @xmath3 bundle with @xmath234 .",
    "we can express @xmath161 as a theta function satisfying the condition @xmath235 where @xmath236 by transforming @xmath237 a general discussion of the theta functions of this type which are eigenfunctions of the laplace - beltrami operator is given in @xcite . in the particular case of interest here , the description of the states in terms of the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary ] )",
    "is fairly straightforward .",
    "we are looking for eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath238 with the minimal eigenvalue , subject to the condition that the eigenfunctions must satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary ] ) .",
    "there are precisely two such eigenfunctions with the minimum eigenvalue @xmath239 .",
    "these functions are given by @xmath240 + 2 \\pi   i ( \\frac{x_1}{l_1 } m-\\frac{x_2}{l_2 }",

    "as @xmath11 becomes small , these functions become localized around the values @xmath242 and @xmath243 , which are precisely the @xmath25 values of the two points of intersection for the dual d - branes . in the corresponding d - brane picture ,",
    "as @xmath11 becomes small the dual radius becomes large and the angle between the branes increases , which as discussed in @xcite should localize the string modes in the vicinity of the intersection points .",
    "furthermore , since the unstable modes are associated with the @xmath167 entries of the @xmath122 matrix , which affect the commutativity between the two brane positions , it is natural to interpret these modes geometrically in terms of a change in topology localized to the brane intersection points .",
    "this corresponds perfectly with what we would expect from the geometrical picture shown in figure  [ f : unstable ] .",
    "how this explicit description of the unstable mode relates to the d - brane instability is difficult to make completely precise , however , due to the nonlocality of the t - duality transformation in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "a better understanding of this relationship might lead to interesting results about brane - anti - brane interactions which could be understood from a simple field theory perspective .",
    "in this paper , we examined the spectra of low - energy fluctuations around various d - brane configurations in string theory and the t - dual spectra of fluctuations around constant background fields in gauge theory .",
    "background fields in the central @xmath3 of a @xmath1 gauge theory correspond to tilted branes on the dual torus . by taking the field theory limit while keeping the tilt angle constant",
    ", we encountered a discrepancy between the field theory spectrum and the string theory spectrum .",
    "the discrepancy was resolved by computing the fluctuation spectrum of the full born - infeld action instead of the yang - mills action .",
    "this is a natural result in light of the fact that the scaling limit which keeps the tilt constant corresponds to scaling up the background field strength keeping @xmath244 constant .",
    "this forces the terms ordinarily subleading in @xmath58 to play a relevant role .",
    "we also examined the spectrum of excitations around constant background fields from reducible connections , corresponding to branes intersecting at an angle on the dual torus .",
    "we found that the results of @xcite can be extended to non - supersymmetric configurations and that the dynamics of tachyons can be studied naturally in the context of gauge theories . in the small angle limit ,",
    "the d - brane and yang - mills spectra are in agreement .",
    "the correspondence breaks down , however , when the angle of intersection is fixed and finite .",
    "we investigated the possibility of making the correspondence exact even at finite angles by considering the full born - infeld action . here",
    ", a non - abelian version of the born - infeld action is necessary to make the appropriate correspondence .",
    "we analyzed the gauge theory spectrum using tseytlin s recent proposal for the symmetrized non - abelian born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "although we were unable to resolve the discrepancy at finite angle in full , we found a strong hint in the general structure of the action suggesting how this discrepancy might be resolved .",
    "it seems rather remarkable that the subtle transcendental relations required to reproduce the correct spectrum of strings attached to the d - branes are encoded in the symmetrized born - infeld action .",
    "perhaps one could turn this type of argument around and use the correspondence with string theory through t - duality as a guiding principle for resolving various difficulties which plague the non - abelian born - infeld action .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the correspondence described here is related to the spatial dependence of the fluctuations in the gauge theory and string theory pictures for intersecting branes . in the gauge theory description ,",
    "the off - diagonal fluctuations correspond to sections of nontrivial @xmath3 bundles over the torus , and are described in @xcite in terms of theta functions .",
    "these theta functions were described in @xcite in terms of linear superpositions along the lattice of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "this description essentially coincides with the characterization of states in a constant magnetic field on the torus in terms of landau levels . on the other hand , as argued by berkooz , douglas and leigh in @xcite , the strings connecting intersecting d - branes are essentially living in a harmonic oscillator potential well and are localized to the intersection of the branes .",
    "it is natural to expect that the spatial dependence of the second quantized string excitations in the intersecting d - brane picture will correspond to gaussian and higher excited harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "this agrees nicely with the theta function description in the gauge theory language ; however , there is a subtlety in this relationship because a t - duality transformation has been performed in some of the directions on the torus .",
    "making this correspondence more precise might lead to a better understanding of the action of t - duality as a map between the hilbert spaces of quantized born - infeld theory and second quantized string theory .",
    "although in this paper we have concentrated on stationary backgrounds , the configurations of tilted and intersecting branes which we have considered here are closely related to boosted branes and systems of branes scattering from one another . for these systems , a convenient dynamical quantity to compute is the phase shift due to scattering @xcite . a discrepancy in the relativistic corrections to d - brane scattering processes as computed in a quantum mechanics model derived from yang - mills theory was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy seems similar in nature to the @xmath172 vs. @xmath175 discrepancy we have described here .",
    "the authors of @xcite also consider the possibility of resolving this discrepancy by considering the full born - infeld action , but encounter similar difficulties in making the exact correspondence at subleading order in backgrounds .",
    "in particular , they report a discrepancy between the phase shift computed from the relativistic 0-brane quantum mechanics ( equation ( 63 ) of @xcite ) @xmath245 and from the semiclassical phase shift in the eikonal approximation ( equation ( 64 ) of @xcite ) @xmath246 it is interesting to note that @xmath247 and @xmath248 are related by a relation similar to ( [ relation ] ) @xmath249 although it is not completely clear why the integral prescription ( [ relation ] ) would apply to the phase shift in resolving the discrepancy between @xmath250 and @xmath251 , this observation provides an indication that by analyzing the combinatorics of tseytlin s symmetrized trace prescription @xcite , relativistic quantum mechanics of 0-branes might be made to agree with the semiclassical calculation .",
    "another aspect of the d - brane / gauge theory correspondence which we have not pursued here , but which is an interesting direction for further study , is the relationship between the moduli spaces of vacua in the two pictures and the corresponding 0-modes of the system .",
    "it was pointed out by van baal in @xcite that the physical 0-modes in the gauge theory picture can be determined explicitly , and that their number corresponds to the expected dimension of the moduli space of instantons .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the moduli space of vacua for the intersecting d - brane system is precisely given by the appropriate instanton moduli space .",
    "the approach we have discussed here may provide a concrete framework in which this connection can be explored in more detail .",
    "the web of relations between string theories and gauge theories has become an active area of investigation in light of our increased understanding of the role d - branes play in the non - perturbative dynamics of string theory and in reformulating string theory itself though m(atrix ) theory .",
    "backgrounds with constant fluxes have played an important role in recent studies of extended objects in m(atrix ) theory @xcite .",
    "although there is clearly more remaining to be said regarding the exact definition of the non - abelian born - infeld theory , it seems that when this theory is properly defined it should provide a mechanism for calculating some rather nontrivial results for systems of interacting d - branes within a field theory context .",
