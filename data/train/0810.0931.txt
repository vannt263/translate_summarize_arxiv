    "the rosette complex ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) is located near the anti - center of the galactic disk in the constellation of monoceros .",
    "the region is very popular , partly because of the staggering beauty of its main feature : a very extended emission nebula which hosts a large central hii region , evacuated by the winds of a central ob association ( see figure [ f : photo ] ) .",
    "the complex is part of a much larger structure known as the northern monoceros region .",
    "this region comprises the mon ob1 cloud ( host of ngc  2264 and the cone nebula ) , the monoceros loop ( ngc 2252 ) , and the mon ob2 cloud in which the rosette is one of the most prominent features ( see figure [ f : perez3 ] ) .",
    "the catalog name for the rosette can be somewhat confusing because it is not unique : the nebula itself is usually cataloged as ngc  2237 or ngc  2246 ( especially by amateur observers ) , although ngc  2237 originally referred to the brightest patch at its western side and ngc  2246 originally pointed to a bright zone at the eastern side . in addition , while the central cluster is usually known as ngc  2244 , it has also been cataloged as ngc  2239 . however , this latter designation historically referred to the brightest star in the region , 12 monocerotis .",
    "the cluster was first noticed by flamsteed in the late 17th century and later reported by william herschel  who did not notice the nebulosity  and john herschel , who discovered several conspicuous nebulosity features and reported them in his general catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 2239 = gc 1420 ) .",
    "a contemporary report on nebulous emission was done by albert marth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 2238 = gc 5361 = marth 99 ) , who described a  small , faint star in nebulosity . \"    other parts of the nebula ( ngc 2237 and ngc 2246 ) were reported by @xcite who cataloged the object as being  pretty bright [ pb ] , very , very large [ vvl ] and diffuse [ diff ] . \"",
    "afterwards , the region was formally known as the  swift nebula , \" until the name  rosette \" became more popular .",
    "the total extent of the rosette was not determined until the first photographic plates were obtained by @xcite .",
    "two of the first applications of rosette nebula photographic data were made by @xcite in his study of diffuse nebulae associated with massive stars , and @xcite , who published a photographic study along with a first discussion on the expansion of the hii region by the winds of o stars in the central cluster .",
    "minkowski also pointed out the existence of elephant trunks and dark globules .",
    "he estimated the mass of the nebula to be @xmath2 and suggested that it could be `` surrounded and probably embedded in obscuring material , '' thus proposing the existence of the companion molecular cloud .",
    "the first formal radio wavelength observation of the rosette nebula was reported by @xcite .",
    "they surveyed the area with the ohio state university antenna at 187.5 mhz with a hpbw resolution of 1.3@xmath3 , and calculated a blackbody temperature of 200 k for the nebula .",
    "later , @xcite used the 85 ft .",
    "tatel telescope to make a very complete study of the nebula at 3 ghz ( 10 cm ) .",
    "his analysis showed convincingly that the rosette nebula is an ionization bounded strmgren sphere and he discussed how it could have formed from a fraction of a large dark cloud with a total mass of approximately 1.4@xmath4  m@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite tabulated the different methods used to determine the age of the nebula . these varied from studies of the properties of the central cavity @xcite to evolutionary models of the hii region based on the luminosity of the stars @xcite .",
    "other methods involve time scales of radiation pressure @xcite , estimates of the formation time for dark globules in the nebula @xcite , and the separation of [ oiii ] emission lines @xcite .",
    "the median value of all these age estimates is approximately @xmath6 yr .",
    "a series of studies by @xcite discussed the global physical characteristics of the rosette complex .",
    "the first two of these are dedicated to the nebula , while the third one is a model of the interaction with the molecular cloud , thus we defer its discussion to section 3 . in the first of the @xcite articles",
    ", he presented a map of the h@xmath7 emission in the nebula region , and calculated a total integrated flux density of @xmath8  w@xmath9m@xmath10 within 60@xmath3 from the center of the hii cavity .",
    "he suggested that the emission is contained in a more or less symmetric ring with a peak at 16@xmath3 from the center .",

    "( 2002 ) & 1390 & spectroscopy +    [ t : distances ]    in the second paper , @xcite reported radio continuum observations ( 1410 and 4750 mhz ) from which he was able to determine that the nebula is bound by ionization , forming a spherical shell with radius of @xmath1120 - 30  pc ( in agreement with the 3.7 , 7.7 and 14.3 ghz observations of * ? ? ? * ) and a total ionized matter mass of 2.3@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath5 ( almost twice the estimate of 1.1@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath5 by * ? ? ?",
    "using the h112@xmath7 and he112@xmath7 ( 4619 and 4621 mhz ) radio recombination lines ( rrl ) celnik calculated a he@xmath14 abundance of 0.12@xmath150.03 and a non - lte average electron temperature for the nebula of @xmath16  k  almost @xmath17  k above the lte  with no evidence for a significant gradient with respect to the radial distance from the center .",
    "however , other studies revealed that the lte temperature of the rosette was definitely not uniform .",
    "for example @xcite found @xmath18 values between 6400@xmath151300 and 8160@xmath151100  k ( average of 7900 k ) across the nebula using h166@xmath7 rrl ( 1424 mhz ) . in a similar study , @xcite calculated non - lte values between 3900@xmath15700 and 6000@xmath15500 k from h100@xmath7 rrl ( 6480 mhz ) observations .",
    "the 25 mhz observations ( decameter length ) of @xcite suggested a median @xmath18 of 3600 k. later , @xcite using continuum absorption observations at 34.5 mhz combined with 2700 mhz observations by @xcite argued that the electron temperature might vary from approximately 5000 k in the southeastern quadrant of the nebula  which contains more dust from the interface with the molecular cloud  to roughly 8000 k at the northwestern regions .",
    "finally , @xcite presented observations of the h92@xmath7 rrl at three points coincident with crucial positions of the 4750 mhz map of celnik which revealed a higher average temperature of 7980@xmath15580  k. they also discussed all other rrl measurements of the rosette nebula available in the literature , and found @xmath18 measurements to vary from 3000 to 10050  k.    the investigation by @xcite revealed a good fit to a @xmath19 , @xmath20 model for the temperature gradient in the nebula cavity which , interestingly , could not be adjusted to the observed iras emission",
    ". instead , they found that this temperature gradient was better adjusted to @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 ( see also section 3.2 ) .    the pioneering observations by @xcite of the hi emission at 21 cm made with the ratan-600 telescope revealed that the rosette complex and the monoceros loop were enclosed in a thin hi envelope 130 pc in diameter , possibly expanding at 20 km@xmath9s@xmath25 , suggesting that the supernova event that gave origin to the monoceros remnant occurred about 1.8@xmath4 yr ago .",
    "the study of @xcite discussed in detail how the supernova event in monoceros could in fact be responsible for the collision of clouds that triggered star formation in ngc 2264 ( 1 mon ) and the rosette complex ( 2 mon ) .",
    "later , @xcite made a new , local 21 cm map of the rosette complex using the arecibo telescope .",
    "they found that neutral gas in the rosette complex is distributed in three main regions which form a rough , extended shell of about 45  pc in radius around the nebula and extend beyond the molecular cloud .",
    "this shell would have a center of expansion at @xmath26 , j2000 ) , and has a mass close to 2@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath5 , which implies a budget of kinetic energy for the shell expansion of approx .",
    "4@xmath1210@xmath27 ergs , or roughly 2% of the total energy available from the stars in ngc  2244 .",
    "the prominent ob association ngc 2244 contains more than 70 high mass sources with spectral types o and b ( 7 and 24 sources respectively , see table [ t : obtable ] ) .",
    "the stars in the cluster are presumed responsible for the evacuation of the central part of the nebula .",
    "@xcite used a fabry - perot interferometer to study the velocity distribution of the low density gas in the cavity and its relation to the cluster . a subsequent analysis by @xcite suggested an initial streaming velocity of 13 km@xmath9s@xmath25 at the ionization front .",
    "later , in the study of @xcite , 700 positions in the nebula were analyzed with multi - slit echelle spectroscopy in h@xmath7 , and these data revealed large systematic velocities of up to 20 km@xmath9s@xmath25 at the cavity , a sign of rapid evacuation of material due to powerful stellar winds .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite .",
    "the cluster itself has been the subject of many detailed studies over the years .",
    "the distance to this young cluster ( and therefore to the entire complex ) has been estimated many times with slightly different results .",
    "table 1 is a compilation of these values , from which the most commonly used is 1600 to 1700  pc .",
    "some of the first visual photometric studies of ngc  2244 were made by @xcite , who constructed the first hr diagram of the cluster and assigned to it a distance modulus of 12.1 mag , and by @xcite , who estimated the mean color excess in the cluster to be @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite and later @xcite , who suggested a value of @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite also proposed an age of 4@xmath151 myr and a star formation efficiency of 22% for the cluster .",
    "later , @xcite completed a proper motion study of 287 stars in the ngc 2244 area .",
    "they confirmed membership for 113 objects , 52 of them from the list of @xcite .    a study that combined photometry as well as spectroscopy was completed by @xcite .",

    "later , they estimated the main sequence turn - off age of the cluster to be 1.9 myr , thus suggesting that the cluster has not stopped forming stars yet .",
    "another important determination by park & sung is the initial mass function ( imf ) of ngc  2244 .",
    "they found it has a flat ( @xmath32 ) imf slope in the range @xmath33 , which compares well with the @xmath34 slope obtained by @xcite . by comparing directly to the imf model of @xcite and to the observed mass function of ngc  2264",
    ", @xcite suggested that the shape of the stellar mass spectrum of ngc 2244 was dominated by high mass stars .",
    "however , they cautioned about the lack of sensitivity at the intermediate and low mass ranges in their sample .",
    "more recently , @xcite , showed that ngc  2244 actually has a standard imf shape regardless of the large number of massive stars .",
    "the most complete spectroscopic study of ngc  2244 was done by @xcite , and it has been widely used in the literature . in particular , @xcite used @xcite data to identify the spectral types of candidate t tauri stars in ngc  2244 . most of available spectral classifications for stars in ngc  2244 are compiled by @xcite , but additional data can be found in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the rosat consortium observations ( @xcite ) yielded 34 x - ray sources in ngc  2244 , with typical x - ray luminosities of @xmath39 ergs  s@xmath25 .",
    "six of these x - ray sources are pms candidates as reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also studied ngc  2244 rosat sources and found that objects with the faintest x - ray emission have very high x - ray to optical luminosity ratios .",
    "they noted that the number of x - ray emitters associated with h@xmath7 emission in ngc  2244 is remarkable .",
    "m. the contours represent @xmath40co levels ( as @xmath41 ) from the survey of @xcite .",
    "labels indicate the main regions of the molecular complex , originally identified by blitz & thaddeus ( 1980 ) .",
    "[ blitzcloud],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    a more recent study by @xcite was dedicated also to analyze the coincidence of rosat with stars of ngc  2244 .",
    "a careful re - sampling of the rosat data combined with new optical imaging and spectroscopic data yield 47 x - ray peaks with stellar counterparts in the nebula region . although it was estimated that about half of the counterparts were late type foreground stars , they could confirmed x - ray emission for the rest .",
    "specifically , x - ray emission was confirmed for the 2 earliest type stars in the cluster ( hd  46223 and hd  46150 with types 05 and o4 respectively ) , for a very young binary ( j063148.30 + 045820.5 ) , for the source hd  259210 which coincides with the location of high speed knots identified by @xcite , and for the source j063309.61 + 044624.5 located near a massive nebular pillar identified by @xcite ( see also section 5.2 ) . taken together ,",
    "all these investigations give strength to the hypothesis that x - ray emitters in ngc  2244 are either very massive or very young in the case of late types .",
    "probably the most sensitive x - ray observations of ngc 2244 to date were obtained with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the chandra space observatory .",
    "the point source analysis by @xcite is complementary to the study of @xcite which was dedicated to investigate the diffuse emission in the hii region ( see section 3.2 ) . within the acis mosaic",
    ", @xcite were able to extract , with high reliability , over 800 x - ray point sources within 20 arcmin from @xmath42 , j2000 ) .",
    "the x - ray sources have luminosities between 10@xmath43 and 10@xmath44 ergs@xmath9s@xmath25 in the hard band ( 2 - 8 kev ) .",
    "all sources with spectral types earlier than b1 were detected .",
    "a total of 712 chandra sources in the @xcite survey were found to be counterparts of near - infrared sources detected in the flamingos ( see section 4 ) and 2mass surveys , down to a mass limit close to 0.1  m@xmath5 . among this x - ray selected sample ,",
    "the fraction of stars with mass @xmath45  m@xmath5 with significant k - band excess ( likely indicative of a circumstellar disk ) is about 6% , and three of the sources were positively identified as potential class i sources .",
    "the unobscured population in ngc 2244 is about 1.2 times larger than that of the onc @xcite and both the xlf and the klf ( constructed from the uniformly sampled 2mass catalog ) appears to suggest a normal salpeter imf for stars with mass @xmath45  m@xmath5 . by comparing to the onc distribution",
    ", they estimate that the total population of ngc 2244 could be around 2000 members .",
    "the radial source density profile of x - ray sources appears to have a relaxed structure around the center of the cluster and suggests a low probability of significant mass segregation .",
    "first attempts to detect co emission associated with the rosette nebula were unsuccessful as they pointed at the nebula region , which is mostly composed of neutral and ionized gas .",
    "the observations reported by  @xcite , which targeted the southeast adjacent region of the nebula , were the first successful detections of molecular gas in the rosette .",
    "their nrao survey mapped over 80% of the @xmath40co emission in the area of the cloud with a 1@xmath3 beam size , and yielded information about its large scale distribution .",
    "they estimated the angular extent of the cloud to be 3.5@xmath46 ( 98 pc at a distance of 1600 pc ) and labeled the most prominent sub - structures ( see figure [ blitzcloud ] ) .",
    "particularly important regions are the _ monoceros ridge _ ( region a1 - 2 ) which is literally a region of gas compression at the cloud - nebula interface ; the _ central core _",
    "( a1 - 1 ) , which hosts the most massive clumps in the cloud and is the strongest region of star formation ; the cores d and g , which are separated from the main body of the cloud but have ongoing star cluster formation ; the _ irs core _ , which hosts the massive proto - binary afgl-961 ( see sections 4 and 5.1 ) ; the _ back core _ b , which is more loose in structure than the regions near the nebula ; and the _ arm _ or e core , which despite its brightness contains no significant star formation ( no iras sources , or near - infrared clusters have been found in this core so far ) .    in a subsequent study , @xcite mapped the @xmath40co and @xmath47co emission with improved sensitivity at the at&t bell labs , uncovering the high degree of clumpiness of the cloud .",
    "@xcite made use of the data from @xcite and listed a total of 95 clumps .",
    "the clumps with evidence of star formation had larger peak temperatures , larger densities and also were more gravitationally bound compared to clumps from the maddalena complex @xcite , a cloud with very low star formation .",
    "later , @xcite showed that about half of the clumps in the rosette molecular cloud were gravitationally bound and the rest were supported by pressure from the inter - clump medium , which was shown to be mostly atomic and about 40 times less dense . in figure [ wbs95_f7 ]",
    "we show the locations and relative sizes of the clumps from @xcite .",
    "co. [ wbs95_f7],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    from the clump central velocities @xcite found that the cloud has a well defined velocity gradient of about 0.08 km@xmath9s@xmath48pc@xmath25 .",
    "also , the negative correlation between clump mass and clump to clump velocity dispersion suggested that the system is still far from equipartition even though it is dynamically evolved .",
    "@xcite also found the star forming activity to be more intense in the ridge and core areas , near the interface cloud - nebula : clumps located near the nebula presented larger excitation temperatures , average densities and star forming efficiencies , all clues of cloud evolution .",
    "other properties of the clumps ( mass , sizes and line widths ) did not show any significant variations along the cloud .",
    "another co study was done by @xcite .",
    "the observations focused on the central part of the cloud , detailing the structure of the midplane star forming cores .",
    "they paid special attention to the irs core , where the source afgl-961 is located ( see also section 5.1 ) and pointed out the ample blue wing emission due to the powerful outflow from this object . in a complementary study , @xcite examined the cii emission ( 158  @xmath37 m ) at the ridge , the central core and the irs core .",
    "they found weak but significant c@xmath14 emission deep into the molecular cloud cores and suggested that the distribution agrees well with a clumpy molecular cloud exposed to a low level uv radiation field .",
    "the penetration of uv photons in the cloud is apparently facilitated by a high density contrast clump - interclump medium .",
    "the clump mass spectrum in the rosette molecular cloud has the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 , depending on the range , bin size and beam resolution used .",
    "the exponent in this power law is similar to other clouds @xcite , but what is more important , it is much shallower than the one corresponding to the stellar imf ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this shows that although there are more small clumps by number , most of the mass is contained in only a few big clumps , while for stars both numbers and total mass are dominated by the lowest mass bins .",
    "interestingly enough , the power law index is in fact similar to that corresponding to the mass distribution function for embedded clusters , which is suggestive of a uniform star formation efficiency for most star forming cores @xcite .",
    "the more recent survey of @xcite , obtained with the wide field array sequoia at the fcrao 14 m telescope achieved resolutions of 45@xmath52 at 115 ghz and 47@xmath52 at 110 ghz .",
    "the maps revealed `` textural variations '' in the @xmath40co emission across the complex , with a brighter emission component within the nebula projected radius ( approx .",
    "30 pc from the center as defined by @xcite , @xcite ) and weaker , more extended emission outside this ionization edge .",
    "@xcite suggest that the weaker emission is probably due to subthermally excited material with lower densities .",
    "they also calculated the total molecular mass of the cloud to be @xmath53  m@xmath5 from @xmath40co , and found a lte mass of @xmath54  m@xmath5 from @xmath47co .",
    "moreover , they were able to apply a principal component analysis @xcite to determine the turbulent flows and the turbulence scale in the rosette molecular cloud",
    ". the analysis revealed more significant variations in the velocity structure of the cloud at the regions located within the ionization than in the more diffuse , external component .",
    "this fact confirms the interaction of the cloud and the hii region .",
    "they suggested , however , that the interaction is still very localized , and have not affected the global dynamics of the cloud yet .",
    "@xcite focused on comparing his h@xmath7 map and radio continuum observations of the nebula ( see section 2.1 ) with the co map of the molecular cloud from @xcite .",
    "celnik constructed a complex model of the distribution of the main co cores ( see fig [ wbs95_f7 ] ) in the context of the hii region and estimated the rotation center of the cloud at @xmath55 , j2000 ) .",
    "finally , he re - calculated the mass of the entire complex by adding the total mass of ionized atoms , stars , dust and molecular gas , resulting in @xmath56  m@xmath5 .",
    "another important study was done by @xcite , who made use of the available infrared emission data from the iras satellite ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  @xmath37 m ) .",
    "@xcite were able to study in great detail the distribution of dust and compared this to the distributions of ionized and molecular gas .",
    "additionally , they were able to estimate a total infrared luminosity of roughly 1.1@xmath1210@xmath57 l@xmath5 , or about 50% of the available luminosity from the cluster ngc  2244 .",
    "warm dust ( usually present near an ob association ) typically emits strongly at the four iras bands .",
    "however , @xcite showed that in the rosette , while the 60 and 100  @xmath37 m emission are quite strong at regions of ionized and neutral gas ( nebula ) , the 12  @xmath37 m emission is preferentially located beyond the limits of the ionization front ( molecular cloud ) , suggesting a heavy rate of destruction of dust grains from uv radiation from the cluster .",
    "surprisingly , the 25  @xmath37 m emission was found to be significant in some parts of the ionized nebula , possibly due to the existence of a second type of dust particle that is more resistant to uv photons .",
    "this was also suggested by @xcite , who found that the maximum temperature in the shallow temperature gradient found in the nebula ( see section 2.1 ) seems too low to sublimate ice mantles in grains and too low for grains to emit significantly at 12 or 25  @xmath37 m  a problem possibly solved with a second type of grain in the region .",
    "later , @xcite suggested that line emission could be contributing strongly to the ir emission of the nebula , and suggested once more that the presence of a  hot dust \" component is necessary to model this emission , especially at 25  @xmath37 m .",

    "credit : @xcite ( 1999 ) and nrao .",
    "[ f : lo12mu],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure [ f : lo12mu ] shows the superposition of the 12  @xmath37 m emission from the iras survey and a 1400 mhz radio continuum emission map from @xcite .",
    "the infrared contours indicate that the warm dust emission defines a shell that encloses the ionization front , showing the effect of heavy dust destruction by the nebula .",
    "the superposition of these maps defines very clearly the region where the hii bubble impacts the molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite observed the se quadrant of the nebula , which coincides with the regions located south and east of the monoceros ridge , where molecular globules were identified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the co and @xmath47co ( @xmath58 ) data of @xcite confirmed that this part of the cloud contained nine well defined cometary globules , which appear to be blue - shifted by approximately 6 km@xmath9s@xmath25 with respect to the rosette molecular cloud .",
    "the globules have sizes of 1 - 3  pc and masses of 50 to 300  m@xmath5 and four of them are coincident with iras sources and local maxima in the @xmath47co emission .",
    "@xcite suggest that these globules can not be formed as rayleigh - taylor instabilities as in the case of globules ( elephant trunks ) in the nw quadrant of the rosette nebula ( see section 5 ) , but rather by a mechanism of radiation driven implosion , caused by penetration of uv radiation from the nebula cluster which favors d - type ionization fronts inside massive clumps , causing the formation of the globules .",
    "a follow up study by @xcite also included co , @xmath47co , and c@xmath59o observations of a similar region , revealing that the globule 1 from @xcite is indeed the largest cometary globule in the area ; this object has a prominent head - tail structure with a projected length of almost 1.3  pc which points away from the center of the nebula .",
    "they also confirmed the agreement with a rdi model and were able to calculate an age of 0.4 myr for the globule , suggesting that it has almost reached the stage of maximum compression and is close to a quasi - static cometary phase .      when the rosette molecular cloud was confirmed as a region of star formation",
    ", @xcite used rosat data again , this time to map the monr2 cluster and the rosette molecular cloud areas in order to confirm a correlation between star forming cores and clusters of x - rays sources .",
    "they found strong x - ray emission in ngc  2244 , at the ridge of the cloud ( a1 - 2 in fig  [ blitzcloud ] ) , and at the cloud core area ( a1 - 1 ) , but the resolution was poor and individual sources could not be resolved .",
    "they suggested that molecular cores known to have active star formation but failing to show significant x - ray emission , could be predominantly forming low - mass stars .",
    "they also suggested that detectable x - ray counterparts are in most cases herbig  ae / be or t tauri stars , as found in ngc  2244 @xcite .",
    "the more recent observations of the rosette complex done with chandra @xcite have resolutions of only a few arcseconds , thus allowing for the detection of x - ray counterparts for 75% of the ob members of ngc  2244 .",
    "one of the most interesting results of this study was the confirmation of a second , soft diffuse emission which probably originates from the o star winds and is later brought to thermalization by wind - wind interactions or by the shock with the surroundings , in this case the molecular cloud ( see figure [ f : chandra ] ) .",
    "this x - ray plasma surrounds the ob association and fills the nebula cavity completely .",
    "the rosette nebula may not only be interacting with its companion molecular cloud .",
    "the location of the rosette nebula near the edge of the monoceros loop @xcite  also known as the monoceros supernova remnant  at the edge of the ne quadrant , has motivated a number of studies aimed at investigating the high energy photon emission in that region .",
    "deep h@xmath7+[nii ] photographic plates by @xcite suggested a correlation between a filamentary structure observable in h@xmath7 emission and a rosette nebula feature observable in 240 mhz radio waves .",
    "this feature was proposed as evidence of loop - nebular interaction and confirmed by decameter @xcite and diffuse x - ray emission @xcite observations .",
    "later , high energy ( 100 mev ) @xmath60-ray images from egret @xcite , revealed a feature partly coincident with the filaments and apparently significant ( 7@xmath61 ) over expected diffuse emission .",
    "if real , this @xmath60-ray feature would possibly be due to the interaction of charged particles with the dense ambient medium at the shock region .",
    "the hegra system of atmospheric cerenkov telescopes at la palma observatory was used to calculate the cosmic ray emission from the loop - nebula interaction region , and found one possible tev emission source ( 3eg j0634 + 0521 ) with low statistical significance @xcite .",
    "more recently , the hess telescope array in namibia was used again to map the snr - nebula interaction region and found one gamma ray source , hess j0632 + 057 , located close to the rim of the monoceros loop @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of massive clumps and luminous iras sources pointed out by the study of @xcite strongly suggested that star formation had already taken place across the molecular cloud .",
    "however , the poor spatial resolution of the iras point source survey did not allow the resolution of individual members of an embedded population .",
    "early near - infrared studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not cover the molecular cloud areas , and optical photometric studies were incapable of detecting obscured populations .",
    "an exploratory near - infrared survey ( jhk ) by @xcite that made use of the imager sqiid finally confirmed the existence of embedded clusters in some of the most massive clumps from the list of @xcite that were associated with an iras source .",
    "@xcite were able to identify by visual inspection of their images seven deeply embedded clusters with bright nebulosities .",
    "other massive clumps did not contained a cluster , which suggests that high mass is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for cluster formation .",
    "complete spatial coverage of the rosette complex in the near - infrared was first accomplished with the release of the all - sky 2mass survey catalogs .",
    "the 2mass survey was a major gain in data uniformity but unfortunately not in sensitivity . due to",
    "the distance to the rosette ( 1.6@xmath150.2 kpc ) , the 2mass completeness limit ( k=14.3  mag ) is not deep enough to study the low mass end of the imf .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of 2mass sources with large h - k colors and they were able to suggest three general areas of cluster formation .",
    "the extensions of these star formation regions were defined visually , and could not be compared with the clusters of @xcite because at that point the extents and membership of individual clusters were not determined .    the survey of @xcite aimed for deeper observations using flamingos on the kpno-2.1 m .",
    "the project was done as part of a flamingos / noao survey of giant molecular clouds .",
    "observations of the rosette covered the regions surveyed by @xcite and extended to the back core and the nebula .",
    "identification of young embedded populations was done by selecting objects with near - infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar emission .",
    "also , a nearest neighbors analysis was applied to this color selected sample to facilitate the detection of embedded clusters as regions with significant local surface densities .",
    "the technique allowed for a clear confirmation of the location and extensions of the seven bright clusters reported in @xcite , labeled as pl01 to pl07 , but also indicated the existence of another two clusters associated with massive clumps in the molecular cloud , labeled as refl08 and refl09 .",
    "the sources with near - infrared excess also traced well the extension of ngc  2244 and a possible new cluster at the western edge of the hii bubble , located at the region historically identified as ngc  2237 , ( see also section 2.2 ) .",
    "finally , a small cluster was detected at the northeast end of the nebula and was labeled refl10 .",

    ". also indicated is the number of near - infrared excess stars detected in each cluster region and the cluster equivalent radii , which was calculated by estimating the extension of each cluster from local surface density contours of near - infrared excess sources above the background level .",
    "we also indicate the number of class i sources reported by @xcite      in order to give insight into the nature of the embedded populations of the rosette molecular cloud , a high resolution mm - wave survey of clusters pl01 to refl08 was performed at the iram 30 m telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* romn - ziga , williams & lada , 2008 ( in prep ) ) .",
    "the cluster regions were scanned for emission in 6 molecules : @xmath40co(2 - 1 ) , @xmath47co(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath59o(2 - 1 ) , cs(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath14(1 - 0 ) and n@xmath70h@xmath14(1 - 0 ) .",
    "all of the clusters show prominent clumps in most tracers , except cluster pl02 which has weak emission in c@xmath59o(2 - 1 ) and n@xmath70h@xmath14(1 - 0 ) . in figure",
    "[ f : pl06 mm ] we show one example of the maps of dense gas emission maps for cluster pl06 ( host of afgl 961 ) .    co(2 - 1 ) which is mapped as peak temperature .",
    "[ f : pl06 mm ] , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    bulk physical properties of the clumps are calculated from these observations .",
    "particularly , mass , sizes and velocity dispersions appear to be fairly similar for all of the cluster areas , which translates to no significant variation of the properties of star forming clumps across the cloud , as suggested by @xcite . however , the morphology of the gas emission is different from clump to clump , suggesting different stages of the clusters evolution .",
    "for example , while the gas emission around clusters pl01 , pl06 , pl07 and refl08 is compact and forms a well defined envelope around the clusters , clusters pl03 , pl04 and pl05 appear to be partially emerging from the clumps , with the gas apparently being swept out from some areas of the cluster and recollected in others .",
    "the emergence of the massive clusters pl04 and pl05 might suggest a late stage of embedded cluster evolution . the emission of dense gas tracers for these clusters is confined to only two relatively small areas which coincide with the most obscured and dense parts of the respective cores . the rest of the stars in the clusters are still embedded in the larger and more quiescent @xmath47co core but some of them are already visible in dss optical plates .",
    "clusters pl04 and pl05 are the largest and most extended embedded clusters in the rosette molecular cloud ( see table [ t : clusters ] ) but could also be the oldest .",
    "these clusters are located in the part of the cloud that is in direct interaction with the shock front from the nebula , as described by @xcite .      in figure",
    "[ f : nndne ] we show the distribution of the surface density of near - infrared excess sources ( young stars ) in the rosette complex as a function of the distance from the center of ngc 2244 , as calculated by @xcite .",
    "young clusters appear as peaks in this distribution , and it is possible to distinguish four main groups of clusters .",
    "the most prominent group contains ngc 2244 , ngc 2237 and refl10 , which are the clusters located in the nebula .",
    "the second group contains clusters pl01 and pl02 and coincides with the cloud ridge ( core a1 - 2 ) .",
    "the third group contains clusters pl04 , pl05 , refl08 and pl06 , all located at the rmc central core , and cluster pl03 located in core d. the fourth and last group contains clusters pl07 and refl09 which are located at the back core of the cloud . in the bottom panel of figure",
    "[ f : nndne ] we show the average infrared excess fraction for each of these cluster groups .",
    "the average excess fraction appears to increase as a function of distance from ngc 2244 , suggesting that the embedded clusters are progressively younger the further they are from the nebula .",
    "the existence of this apparent age sequence indicates that star formation in the rosette did indeed take place sequentially in time , but not in the way proposed by @xcite , because that model requires one episode of cluster formation to trigger the next one .",
    "the relative age differences of clusters can not be large enough to account for such a scenario .",
    "instead , it appears that the overall age sequence of cluster formation may be primordial , possibly resulting from the formation and evolution of the molecular cloud itself .",
    "the hii region can not be responsible for the sequence of cluster ages , although it does appear to have a significant impact on the underlying sequence by either enhancing or inhibiting the star forming process : at the cloud ridge , the direct interaction with hot , ionized gas might contribute to the rapid evaporation of cluster envelopes in pl01 and pl02 , possibly stopping the star formation process at an early stage ; however , recent chandra and spitzer telescope observations ( wang et al .",
    "( in prep ) ; @xcite , 2008 ) suggest that pl02 hosts two class 0/i sources , which is suggestive of cluster substructures younger than pl04 or pl05 . at the central core , where the main interaction between the nebula and the molecular cloud takes place",
    ", the result is an enhancement of the star formation efficiency , evidenced by the fact that the clusters in this area ( pl04 , pl05 , pl06 , refl08 ) account for almost 50% of the total embedded population in the cloud .",
    "finally , at the back core the influence of the hii region is minimal and star formation in this part of the cloud may have occurred spontaneously @xcite .",
    "particular attention in the literature has been given to cluster pl06 , associated with the bright infrared source afgl961 .",
    "the source was originally identified by @xcite , who also obtained its spectral energy distribution from 2 to 18  @xmath37 m .",
    "this distribution was later extended to include measurements at 53 , 100 and 175  @xmath37 m by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the co emission towards the source is strongly self absorbed and presents broad wings , evidence of a violent interaction of the central source with the molecular envelope .",
    "these characteristics were confirmed by @xcite and @xcite . the powerful co outflow that generates the wings was measured to have a gas kinetic energy close to @xmath71 ergs , and is moving almost 19 m@xmath5 of material @xcite .",
    "the outflow is bipolar and spectral signatures revealed that the outflow is in fact caused by an ionized wind .",
    "the self absorption is possibly caused by a foreground layer of colder material , and in fact , infrared spectra at 1 @xmath37 m and 1 mm obtained by @xcite revealed the presence of ice bands towards the source , confirming the effect .",
    "the central source in afgl961 is a b type pms binary with a separation of approximately 0.05 pc , hence the common nomenclature afgl961a and afgl961b , which refer to the eastern and western component , respectively . near infrared observations @xcite revealed that approximately another 30 young sources are associated with this cluster , and @xcite was able to demonstrate that at least 9 of these sources were associated with shock - like features which corroborated the strong interaction with the local medium .",
    "figure  [ f : afgl961 ] combines a flamingos image with @xmath40co(2 - 1 ) data from the @xcite survey in the form of integrated intensity contours .",
    "self absorption is evident even in the averaged spectra , and the red and blue wings appear to confirm the existence of two different components of the gas outflow , although none of them are highly collimated .",
    "the [ sii ] survey of @xcite revealed 13 regions of excited gas , 3 associated with external excitation from winds of ngc  2244 sources and 10 associated with winds from young sources in the embedded clusters of the molecular cloud .",
    "most of the main clusters host one of these [ sii ] features , all reminiscent of hh objects and thus suggestive of strong interaction of young sources with their surrounding medium or at least of a high frequency of collimated outflows from young sources .",
    "counterpart near infrared h@xmath70 observations @xcite revealed that one source in the [ sii ] study , rmc - c ( 06315690 + 0419026 ) could be in fact a class i object associated with a large outflow designated hh 871 .",
    "the source is very close to cluster pl01 and could be associated with it .",
    "see figure [ f : hh871 ] .",
    "a series of studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were dedicated to the investigation of a group of dense dense nebulous knots located at the south eastern edge of the hii cavity in the nebula area at approx .",
    "@xmath72 , j1950 ) . in the first paper , @xcite obtained h@xmath7+[nii ] filter photographs of the central cavity areas and combined them with echelle spectroscopy data .",
    "they suggested two possibilities for the origin of the knots : a ) they are hh objects propulsed by t tauri sources with bipolar activity , or b ) they are bow shocks around dense globules overtaken by large wind driven shells .    in the second study ,",
    "@xcite generated a data cube of [ oiii]5007 @xmath73 profiles obtained by scanning the knot areas with a multi - slit echelle spectrometer .",
    "they noticed that the largest knot , labeled c , is indeed very bright in this line , and suggested again that the feature might originate from a low mass young star . in their third study , @xcite studied again the prominent knot c. the combined observations plus k band images identified candidates for the driving sources , and proposed that the top group of knots  which appear to coincide with k band sources  are all associated with a giant herbig - haro flow .",
    "the large scale of the corresponding outflow would be consistent with the idea of a large jet associated with the source rmc - c ( see figure [ f : hh871 ] ) , thus confirming the existence of parsec scale flows in the rosette .",
    "several flamingos sources lie in the area and the knots are barely visible in j and h , so a very interesting follow up would be to determine if any other faint sources are also associated with the knots .",
    "also , @xcite found a possible microjet associated with a low mass young star , and most likely observable due to the ly-@xmath7 emission of the nebula .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the discovery of two a cometary jet systems with external irradiation .",
    "these two objects were recently catalogued as hh  889 and hh  890 ( see http://casa.colorado.edu/hhcat/ ) .",
    "these jets are immersed in the photoionized region and thus are awash by heady uv radiation , which apparently results in an interesting set of bow shock structures . given the age of ngc 2244 , there is an upper limit of 1 - 2 myr in the timescale of the jet production .",
    "interestingly , the objects associated as the driving sources present no infrared excess @xcite , which suggests a very rapid disk dissipation , with timescales of 10@xmath74 to 10@xmath13 yr @xcite , leading to a rapid transition from ctts to wtts stages @xcite .",
    "these aspects pose interesting questions about the environmental dependence of the mechanisms of jet formation and also suggest that ctts and wtts objects can be spatially mixed in regions of massive star formation .    at the northwestern edge of the central cavity in the rosette nebula , there is a large group of prominent dusty pillar structures or _ elephant trunks _",
    "( @xcite , see figure [ f : globs ] ) .",
    "@xcite observed this region in co and @xmath47co ( j=1@xmath750 ) , and found that the morphology of the molecular gas emission in the area follows very closely the optical outline of the pillar features .",
    "a very interesting fact is that the physical properties of the globules associated with the larger pillar structures are not different from those of globules in clouds not associated with hii regions .",
    "individual globules in the area have h@xmath70 densities of @xmath76 @xmath77 and temperatures of @xmath78  k. the trunks have velocity gradients of up to 1.1 km@xmath9@xmath79 , oriented along their direction of elongation and these gradients might be responsible for the morphology .",
    "the `` stretching '' of the trunks might have a time scale of @xmath113 to 6 @xmath80 yr , which is consistent with the dynamical age of the hii region given an expansion rate of 20 km@xmath9s@xmath25 .",
    "later , the studies of @xcite ( @xcite ) were dedicated to study the internal structure of the elephant trunks . by constructing an extinction map of the largest trunk from a b - band ccd image",
    ", they were able to identify a clear helical structure , which they suggest might originate from an alignment with a primordial helical magnetic field ( magnetic rope model ) .",
    "if true , this magnetic field would be present before the hii region was formed , and it could be responsible for maintaining the trunk - system and would explain the observed velocity gradient even after erosion from the winds of ngc  2244 .",
    "@xcite observed 4 of the densest ` teardrops ' located at the tips of the elephant trunks . using the iram 30 m telescope they found significant emission in @xmath40co(1 - 0 and 2 - 1 ) , @xmath47co(1 - 0 and 2 - 1 ) and cs(2 - 1 and 3 - 2 ) .",
    "they confirmed kinetic temperatures for the globules between 15 and 20 k and masses between 0.02 and 0.5 m@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath40co line profiles had significant outflow ( wing ) components , possibly indicating the pressure exerted by the ionized gas in the hii region on the neutral gas of the teardrops .",
    "recently , @xcite made a complete survey of the entire chain of dark trunks in the northwest edge of the central cavity .",
    "they observed 23 fields in h@xmath7 using the 2.6 m nordic optical telescope , obtaining images of filaments and globules at a resolution of 0.188 pix@xmath25 ( about 300 au at @xmath81  pc ) .",
    "the observations revealed a total of 145 individual small globules , many of them located in isolation near large pillars .",
    "they were able to obtain density profiles for the globulettes by converting from @xmath82 extinction , and showed that most objects agreed well with @xmath83 configurations typical of protostellar conditions .",
    "the total densities of the globules varied from @xmath84 to @xmath85  @xmath77 and values of total mass assuming uniform density were found to agree well with those obtained for the few counterparts from the survey of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that many objects had radii under 10,000 au , with a distribution peak around 25,000 au .",
    "the distribution of mass for the globulettes above a detection limit of 1 m@xmath86 peaked at about 13 m@xmath86 , with only a few objects exceeding 60 m@xmath86 .",
    "no near - infrared counterparts have been found to be convincingly associated with the globulettes , possibly indicating that none of these objects is a genuine proplyd or a protostar .",
    "virial analysis yields the result that above 60% of the globulettes have conditions for gravitational contraction .",
    "furthermore , the free - fall times were estimated to be of a few times 10@xmath87  yr , or about one order of magnitude shorter than the photoevaporation times , estimated to be of the order of 3 to 4 myr .",
    "this large photoevaporation timescale is surprisingly large in the harsh environment of ngc 2244 , but may be due to a process of slow compression that follows the erosion of the outer layers by photoevaporation .",
    "one of the most interesting conclusions from this study is that the small rosette nebula globules may be the predecessors to brown dwarfs or planetary mass objects , reinforcing the idea that these kind of low mass objects can form in isolation following a process of contraction similar to stars , and not only by ejection or disruption of protoplanetary disks .",
    "after 80 years of studies , the rosette complex is known as one of the most important astrophysical laboratories for the study of the many aspects of star formation .    a solid basis for the investigation of the rosette complex has been successfully set .",
    "we have now a very detailed picture of the physical properties of the hii region and the molecular cloud , and we have located the majority of the stars that have formed across the complex .",
    "the rosette has been actively forming stars for the last 2 to 3 myr ( based on the age of ngc  2244 ) and it will probably continue doing so , as there is still sufficient molecular material ( @xmath88  m@xmath5 ) , placed in a heavily stimulated environment : the large photodissociation region excavated by the ob association ngc  2244 is in clear interaction with the adjacent molecular cloud , which after several years of investigations has revealed an abundant embedded population .",
    "also , it appears that another population of young , low mass stars could form in the surroundings of the central cavity ( ngc 2237 , refl10 and the small globules , if they are truly predecesors to low mass objects ) .",
    "could these be evidence of triggered formation ?",
    "the formation of embedded clusters and associations in the adjacent molecular cloud was clearly affected by the interaction with the nebula , but we still have to understand the extent of that interaction .",
    "the different cluster formation episodes appear to suggest that the current star forming properties of the rosette molecular cloud could be related to the early evolution of the cloud , and not only to the interaction with the hii region .    in the near future",
    "it will be necessary to investigate the possible differences in the mechanisms of cluster formation , the variations in the star formation efficiency across the cloud , the observed properties of clusters and the definitive role of the local environment .",
    "all of this information will be of enormous value for the global study of star formation .",
    "now that the second generation of clusters in the rosette has been identified , it is expected to be studied in even greater detail using infrared spectroscopy .",
    "such investigations will be of great help to constrain the relative ages of the embedded populations and to reconstruct the history of formation in the region .",
    "also , the near - future development of observational technologies and continuous improvements in the modeling of the interstellar medium and formation of clusters are promising , to say the least , for one of the most notorious targets in modern astronomy .",
