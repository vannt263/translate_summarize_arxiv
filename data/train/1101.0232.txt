    "the energy relaxation time @xmath1 of superconducting qubits is affected by dielectric loss , nonequilibrium quasiparticles @xcite , and charge or bias noise , and varies between a few nano- to several microseconds , depending on qubit type , material , and device layout .",
    "superconducting qubits are commonly based on @xmath2 thin films , and their central element , the non - linear inductor given by a josephson tunnel junction ( jj ) , is formed either by overlap @xcite or window - type geometries @xcite .",
    "qubit spectroscopy reveals coupling to stochastically distributed two - level systems ( tlss ) in the tunnel oxide @xcite which provide a channel for qubit decoherence .",
    "while the physical nature of tlss is still under debate , their number was shown to decrease with junction size and their density with higher atomic coordination number of the tunnel oxide @xcite .",
    "the number of coherent oscillations in the qubit is limited by , among other decoherence mechanisms such as nonequilibrium quasiparticles , the _ effective _ dielectric loss tangent @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the overlap geometry provides jjs with amorphous barriers with no need for isolation dielectrics , being itself a source for additional tlss and dielectric losses .",
    "the window geometry is used for higher quality , e.g. epitaxial , trilayer jjs with in - situ grown barriers . besides complex fabrication",
    ", they have the drawback of requiring additional isolation dielectrics @xcite .",
    "the importance of keeping the total dielectric volume in qubits small to reduce the additional loss was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we give an overview of our standard technology for junction fabrication , and present an alternative junction based on sputtered trilayer stacks , which provide an intrinsically cleaner tunnel oxide and is well suited for micron - sized trilayer qubit junctions .",
    "the so - called _ side - wall passivated jjs _ provide contact to the top electrode without adding too much lossy dielectric to the circuitry , which would negatively affect the loss tangent .",
    "the trilayer isolation is achieved via an electrolytic process .",
    "these novel jjs were realized in a flux - biased phase qubit and characterized by i ) current transport measurements on reference junctions and ii ) spectroscopy and time - domain measurements of the qubit .    by systematically replacing only the josephson junction ,",
    "being central to any superconducting qubit , we aim to analyze the loss contributions of this specific element , and , ideally , develop low - loss josephson junctions for superconducting qubits and improve our qubit performance .",
    "we found performance comparable to the current generation of overlap phase qubits .",
    "figure [ sidewallanod ] depicts the patterning process for our standard overlap ( a ) and trilayer junctions ( b ) .",
    "our standard process has an oxide layer grown on an ion mill cleaned aluminum edge , which was previously chlorine etched .",
    "the top wiring is then etched back below the oxide layer using argon with @xmath4 chlorine mixture . for the trilayer process ,",
    "the in - situ sputtered @xmath2-@xmath5-@xmath2 trilayer has a thermally grown tunnel oxide barrier , formed for 10 min at @xmath6 at room temperature .",
    "after deposition of the trilayer stack an edge is etched .",
    "the bottom electrode of the trilayer stack is isolated from the top electrode wiring by a self - aligned nanometer thin dielectric layer , grown for @xmath2 ( or other suitable electrode metals such as @xmath7 ) by anodic oxidation @xcite .",
    "the metallic aluminium serves as partly submerged anode in a liquid electrolytic mixture of @xmath8 ammonium pentaborate , @xmath9 ethylene glycol and @xmath10 @xmath11 at room temperature .",
    "a gold - covered metal served as cathode and the electric contact was made outside the electrolyte to the anode . by protecting parts of the aluminum electrode with photoresist only a well - defined area was oxidized by passing a constant current through the al film and converting the metallic surface to its oxide form .",
    "the oxide thickness can be controlled by the voltage drop across the electrolyte . after a light ion clean and top wiring deposition the resist",
    "is patterned to define the junction area .",
    "finally , the trilayer is etched below the tunnel barrier , yielding josephson junctions with planar tunnel barrier and isolation dielectric on just one side of the tunnel area .",
    "the in - situ grown tunnel oxide avoids sources of residual impurities such as hydrogen , hydroxide or carbon at the interface vicinity , which may remain even after ion - milling in our standard process .",

    "now , we discuss the individual loss contributions for all dielectrics .",
    "we design the qubit so that the dominant capacitance comes from the shunt capacitor made from a - si : h , which has a relatively low loss tangent of @xmath52 . including the non - negligible capacitance of the tunnel junction",
    ", this gives an effective loss tangent to the qubit of @xmath53 .",
    "because the junction capacitance is about 10% of the shunting capacitance , the effective junction loss tangent is 10 times less than the loss tangent of the junction oxide .",
    "we statistically avoid the effects of two - level systems by purposely choosing to bias the devices away from the deleterious resonances .",
    "the loss tangent of the junction is smaller than the value for bulk aluminum oxide , approximately @xmath54 , and probably smaller than @xmath55 since long energy decay times ( @xmath56 ) have been observed for an unshunted junction when operated away from resonances @xcite .",
    "+ the anodic side - wall oxide contributes a small capacitance of about 3.2ff , which can be calculated assuming a parallel plate geometry . here",
    ", we use the dielectric constant @xmath57 for aluminum oxide , assume an area given by @xmath58 m , the width of the overlap , multiplied by @xmath59 m the thickness of the base layer , and estimate the thickness of the oxide @xmath60 nm as determined by the anodic process @xcite . the anodic oxide is assumed to have a bulk loss tangent of @xmath54 @xcite , which gives a net qubit loss contribution of @xmath61 , about 5 times lower than for the a - si : h capacitor .",
    "note that we expect the loss from this capacitance to be even lower because of statistical avoidance of the tls loss @xcite .",
    "the small volume of the capacitor , equivalent to a @xmath62 volume tunnel junction , implies that most biases do not put the qubit on resonance with two - level systems in the anodic oxide .",
    "from the measured energy decay time @xmath63 , we determine the loss tangent of the qubit to be @xmath64 , using a qubit frequency @xmath65 .",
    "this is 3 - 5 times larger than our estimation of our dielectric losses , as shown in table [ tab : lossestimation ] .",
    "we believe the dissipation mechanism comes from some other energy loss sources as well , such as non - equilibrium quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the use of a anodic oxide , self - aligned to the junction edge , does not degrade the coherence of present phase qubits @xcite .",
    "we found performance comparable to the current generation of overlap phase qubits .    the new junction geometry may provide a method to integrate submicron sized , superior quality junctions ( lower tls densities ) grown , for example , by mbe epitaxy to eliminate the need for shunt dielectrics .",
