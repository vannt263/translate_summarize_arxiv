    "the study of griffiths  phases @xcite in intermetallic compounds have reached much interest in the recent years . the extended griffiths  model @xcite accounts for systems in which the magnetic correlations do not vanish completely at the first order phase transition , but are present at higher temperatures .",
    "the griffiths - like phase  is then the region between the completely ordered state ( i.e. above @xmath1 ) and the conventional disordered paramagnetic state .",
    "experimentally a griffiths - like phase  has been usually identified as the paramagnetic susceptibility shows deviations from a curie - weiss  law and extreme sensitivity to applied magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite an increasing number of very interesting systems are being reported to show that kind of behavior . among those , compounds that show giant magneto - caloric effect like tb@xmath4si@xmath0ge@xmath0,@xcite colossal magneto - resistance like la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath7,@xcite la@xmath5ca@xmath6mno@xmath7,@xcite or la@xmath8dy@xmath6ca@xmath9mno@xmath7,@xcite strongly correlated electron systems like ceni@xmath5cu@xmath6@xcite or itinerant magnetic semiconductors like fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 @xcite are remarkable examples .",
    "in all those systems , the presence of a griffiths - like phase  is related with the existence of short range order magnetic correlations , which is evidenced from the enhancement of the magnetic signal in small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) measurements .",
    "it is very interesting therefore , to revisit those well studied materials in which there are experimental evidences of important short range correlations well above @xmath1  in order to determine whether or not they also show a griffiths - like phase  behavior .",
    "what is more , a general question should be open : are griffiths - like phases a common phenomena in a wide range of intermetallic compounds and what role they play in the magnetic properties of those compounds ? in that sense , we present in this paper a study of the paramagnetic @xmath3 susceptibility of the intermetallic compound erco@xmath0  in the search of the fingerprint of griffiths - like phases .    among the intermetallic compounds , the family of the @xmath10co@xmath0  are particulary interesting as they have a fairly simple structure , which facilitates the understanding or their magnetic properties .",
    "in fact they have been widely studied for decades as a model system of the magnetism of itinerant electron systems and metamagnetic processes .",
    "however , it was not until recently that short range order correlations were shown to exist well within the paramagnetic phase of one of the members of the series .",
    "a sans study in the compound erco@xmath0  showed the presence of magnetic clusters of around 8   at temperatures as high as twice the ordering temperature when a magnetic field of 1 t is applied.@xcite indeed , this behavior is related with the existence of the new magnetic phase reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a new magnetic phase diagram for erco@xmath0  was proposed .",
    "we have denoted that new magnetic phase the @xmath11 phase as -although no long range order exist in the compound- the co moments are found to be , in average , oriented antiparallel to the er moments .",
    "the molecular field created by er moments on the co sublattice in erco@xmath0  is just above the critical value to induce the metamagnetic transition in the co moments .",
    "therefore , the co sublattice is especially sensitive to variations of the external parameters .",
    "below @xmath1 , the magnetic behavior is dominated by the er sublattice , with an essentially temperature - independent magnetic moment of around 8.8 @xmath12  per atom , while the co sublattice is ordered antiparallel to the er one through a first - order magneto - structural transition.@xcite in the paramagnetic phase , the nature of the cobalt magnetic moment is an especially interesting open question .",
    "a recent work by liu and altounian @xcite predicted theoretically a transition from a low - spin state for co ( @xmath13  0.1  @xmath12 ) to the well known high - spin state of the ferrimagnetic phase ( @xmath13  1  @xmath12 ) at the onset of the ordering temperature of erco@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , whether or not an intrinsic magnetic moment in the co sublattice exists has been a continuous matter of debate since the first susceptibility studies carried in the @xmath10co@xmath0  series .",
    "@xcite the present study of the paramagnetic @xmath3 susceptibility in erco@xmath0  will also deal with the existence and nature of co moment in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; we describe the synthesis and characterization of the samples in section [ sec : samplecharacterization ] .",
    "the experimental results and discussion will be presented in section [ sec : experimentalresults ] : the @xmath3 susceptibility measurements as a function of temperature and as a function of the excitation frequency will be shown in subsections [ subsec : xt ] and [ subsec : xw ] respectively .",
    "the determination of the co magnetic moment form the those data will be presented in subsection [ subsec : calcmoment ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the main results obtained .",
    "the erco@xmath0  samples are polycrystalline ingots and were prepared by melting the pure elements in an induction furnace under ar atmosphere .",
    "the resulting ingots were further annealed under ar atmosphere at 850 @xmath14c for a week , wrapped in tantalum foil .",
    "several ingots were synthesized in order to check the reproducibility of the phenomena studied .",
    "x - ray diffraction analysis at room temperature was performed on powdered samples to check their quality .",
    "rietveld analysis of the diffractograms was perform using fullprof software@xcite assuring single phase samples with good crystallization and the expected cubic fd@xmath15 m .",
    "no impurities were found within the 1% accuracy of powder diffraction methods .",
    "the room temperature x - ray diffractogram together with the rietveld refinement can be found in ref .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements were also performed in the sample at 100 , 50 and 5 k. the neutron diffractogram for erco@xmath0  at 5 and 100 k are shown in fig .",
    "a low angle signal can be observed in the 100 k measurement , indicating the presence of short range correlations in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the rietveld refinement at 5 k confirms the ferrimagnetic coupling of er and co with magnetic moments for er and co of 8.84 @xmath16 @xmath12  and 0.95 @xmath17 @xmath12  respectively , and the space group r@xmath15 m .",
    "a complete magnetic characterization has been performed on the erco@xmath0  samples .",
    "magnetization measurements , @xmath18 , from 10 to 300 k and up to 5 t were performed in a squid quantum design magnetometer and up to 9 t in a commercial quantum design extraction magnetometer . selected @xmath19 and @xmath20 curves",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2_mtherco2 ] , where the abrupt change on magnetization at the magnetostructural transition ( e.g. @xmath1  = 34 k at @xmath21 = 1 t ) can be observed .",
    "the data are fully consistent with those previously reported.@xcite    we have measured @xmath3 magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature ( @xmath22 ) and as a function of excitation frequency @xmath23  ( @xmath24 ) in a variety of polycrystalline erco@xmath0  samples .",
    "the measurements were performed in a commercial squid quantum design magnetometer under zero dc applied magnetic field , from 5 to 300 k , with an excitation @xmath3 field of 4.5 oe and at @xmath23  ranging from 0.1 to 1000 hz .",
    "we have also measured @xmath22  under applied magnetic fields up to 2500 oe in a single crystal , courtesy of prof .",
    "ernst bauer from vienna university of technology .",
    "the @xmath3 susceptibility measurements will be presented along the paper .",
    "the real ( @xmath25 ) and imaginary ( @xmath26 ) contributions to the erco@xmath0  @xmath3 susceptibility as a function of temperature under zero dc applied magnetic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3_xac_0 t ] .",
    "a sharp peak can be observed at the ordering temperature ( 32 k ) both in the real and imaginary parts , followed by an abrupt drop of the signal above @xmath1 .",
    "this drop corresponds to the expected curie - weiss  dependence of @xmath25  in the paramagnetic phase :    @xmath27    however , together with that contribution to the paramagnetic @xmath3 susceptibility , a small anomaly near @xmath28  = 90 k can be observed .",
    "this anomaly is more evident both in the inverse of @xmath25  and in @xmath26 , where a peak of 20 k - wide is present in the proximity of @xmath28  = 90 k ( see inset in fig .  [ 3_xac_0 t ] ) . if the region of the anomaly is excluded , the inverse of @xmath25  has a linear dependence with the temperature and therefore can be fitted to a curie - weiss  law using @xmath29 = 8.8 @xmath12 , the value of the atomic er magnetic moment .",
    "the fit , shown in the inset of upper panel in fig .",
    "[ 3_xac_0 t ] , is valid from high temperatures ( @xmath13 300 k ) down to 30 k above the magneto structural transition , and indicates that the curie - weiss  contribution is due to independent er moments .",
    "accordingly , the difference of @xmath25  and the er contribution ( @xmath30 ) is the susceptibility due to the co sublattice ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the detachment of the different contributions to the paramagnetic susceptibility can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the existence of a co contribution to the @xmath3 susceptibility , independent from that of er , proves that the co atoms have an intrinsic moment in the paramagnetic phase independent from the er sublattice , in good agreement with the fact that temperature dependent xmcd at the co l@xmath32  edges shows the presence of co magnetic moment at temperatures above @xmath1 .",
    "similar deviations of 1/@xmath25  from a linear dependence with the temperature well above the ordering transition has been found in other intermetallic compounds like ceni@xmath5cu@xmath6,@xcite la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath7,@xcite tb@xmath4si@xmath0ge@xmath0,@xcite fe@xmath33co@xmath5s@xmath0 @xcite la@xmath34ba@xmath35mno@xmath7,@xcite nd@xmath36sr@xmath37mn@xmath5ga@xmath6o@xmath7,@xcite and gd@xmath4ge@xmath38,@xcite and have been related to the occurrence of a griffiths - like phase  well above their ordering temperatures .",
    "the appearance of a griffiths  phase is usually associated with the existence of disorder and competing interactions , which leads to percolative phenomena and clustering .",
    "indeed sans experiments carried in some of those compounds have demonstrated the occurrence of short range order correlations.@xcite    in the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0 , the existence of short range order correlations is evidenced by the neutron diffraction data at 100 k presented in fig .",
    "[ 1_dn ] as well as in a previous sans study on the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0.@xcite those sans measurements revealed the existence of magnetic clusters in a wide temperature range well above @xmath1 .",
    "the fits of the sans data to lorentzian and lorentzian - squared functions corresponding respectively to spin waves and static regions of spin ordering show that in erco@xmath0  the only significant contribution is lorentzian , i.e. the short range correlations in its paramagnetic phase are due to spin waves .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath39 , obtained from those fits , experiences a continuous increase from high temperatures ( @xmath40 200 k ) down to @xmath41 60 k ( at 1 t ) , where it reaches a plateau at an almost constant value of 78   ( at lower temperatures , just above @xmath1 , @xmath39 diverges due to the establishment of long range order ) .",
    "the existence of such a plateau in @xmath39 implies that the percolation does not occur due to the growing of clusters but by the increasing of the density of clusters with sizes around 78  .",
    "this process differs form the standard normal percolation process and has been predicted and observed for griffiths - like phases .",
    "@xcite therefore , from what has been show above , it is reasonable to establish that both the deviation from a curie - weiss  law and the existence of clusters in the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0  comes from the presence of a griffiths - like phase .",
    "the characteristic features of the @xmath3 susceptibility in a griffiths - like phase  are usually suppressed under small magnetic fields , an effect that has been referred to as _ extreme sensitivity_.@xcite that is indeed the case in polycrystalline erco@xmath0 , where the observed peak in @xmath25  near @xmath28  = 90 k at @xmath21 = 0 t disappears when a magnetic field is applied . in the erco@xmath0  single crystal , the same anomaly near @xmath28",
    "= 90 k can be also observed under moderately small applied magnetic fields .",
    "[ 4_xac_singlecrystal ] shows the real ( upper panel ) and the imaginary part ( lower panel ) of the susceptibility at zero applied magnetic field ( left ) and under applied magnetic fields up to 2500 oe ( right ) .",
    "a peak at @xmath1  can be observed , although it is not as sharp as in the polycrystalline samples , probably due to the twinning originated in the high pressures this sample suffered in the past , as we confirmed by x - ray laue diffraction experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the anomaly at @xmath28  is clearly visible both in the real and in the imaginary part , and its evolution with the applied magnetic field can be followed : the intensity of the anomaly decreases as soon as a few oe are applied , at the same time as it moves to lower temperatures . at applied magnetic fields higher that 1000 oe , the anomaly disappears , and",
    "the linear dependence of 1/@xmath25  with the temperature is recovered .",
    "this evolution of @xmath22  with the applied magnetic field again supports the existence of a griffiths - like phase  above the ferrimagnetic order in erco@xmath0 .      to further investigate the fingerprint of this griffiths - like phase  in the paramagnetic susceptibility ,",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the @xmath3 susceptibility with the excitation frequency @xmath23 .",
    "[ 3_xac_0 t ] shows @xmath22  measurements in the vicinity of @xmath28  for @xmath23  = 1 , 10 , 100 and 1000 hz .",
    "the anomaly already shown for 100 hz in fig .",
    "[ 3_xac_0 t ] is present for all the frequencies , but a shift to higher temperatures ( of 9 k when going from 1 hz to 1000 hz ) can be observed as the frequency is increased both in the real and imaginary part or the susceptibility .",
    "this fact confirms that the origin of the anomaly at @xmath28  is not in the magnetic ordering of any impurity which may be present in the sample occurring at that temperature .",
    "excluding the temperature region where the anomaly is present , no other frequency dependence can be observed , as the er contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility is @xmath23-independent for that frequency range .",
    "the frequency dependence of the co contribution together with the recovery of the curie - weiss  dependence below @xmath28  ( i.e. the co contribution going to zero below @xmath28 ) , allows to identify the origin of the anomaly as a relaxation process in the co sublattice in the proximities of @xmath28.@xcite    therefore , the next step is to study the dynamic response of this co contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility .",
    "to do so , we have performed @xmath3 susceptibility measurements as a function of the excitation frequency ( @xmath24 ) at zero applied magnetic field , excitation frequencies between 0.05 and 1500 hz and in the temperature region between 80 and 100 k.    owing to the fact that er moments do not suffer mayor changes in that temperature range , the er contribution to the susceptibility can be considered as constant at fixed temperatures .",
    "this offers an advantage with respect to the study presented in the previous subsection , as it facilitates the identification of the co contribution .",
    "i.e. co contribution is the only contribution varying as a function of @xmath23  in an isothermal measurement .",
    "the evolution with temperature of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath24  can be observed in fig .",
    "[ 5_xac_frec ] .",
    "as expected , the real part decreases as the frequency is increased .",
    "a small shoulder is present in the vicinity of @xmath28 , which moves to higher frequencies as the temperature is raised ( in agreement with the shift observed in fig .",
    "[ 3_xac_0 t ] ) . in the imaginary contribution to @xmath24 , two maxima can be observed , which also move to higher frequencies as the temperature is raised .",
    "[ 6_colecole ] shows isothermal @xmath26  @xmath42 @xmath25  curves for selected temperatures .",
    "this kind of representation -where the excitation frequency is an implicit parameter- is the so called cole - cole representation . for a system of independent spins undergoing a relaxation process ( i.e. a debye  process with only one relaxation time ) @xmath26",
    "@xmath42 @xmath25  is a perfect semicircle , represented in fig .",
    "[ 6_colecole ] with a discontinuous line ( note that the horizontal and vertical axes have different scales , and therefore , the circle appears to be an ellipse ) .",
    "this representation allows to determine , just by mere visual inspection , deviations in the susceptibility from a debye  process : the cole - cole representation for erco@xmath0  shows stretched and asymmetric curves , and , in the frequency range studied , two maxima can be observed .",
    "this evidences that the observed anomaly in @xmath24  and @xmath22  is not due to a single relaxation time but to a bimodal distribution of relaxation times .",
    "the @xmath3 susceptibility in a debye  process with only one relaxation time can be usually fitted to a debye  law@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the relaxation time , @xmath45 is the value at infinite @xmath23  and @xmath46 is the value at @xmath23  = 0 , which follows a curie - weiss  law as a function of temperature .",
    "however , in systems with broad distributions of relaxations times as in erco@xmath0 , @xmath47 does not obey eq .",
    "[ eq : d ] , and there are numerous empiric approximations to parametrize the @xmath3 susceptibility .",
    "many of those approximations are modifications of the debye  law .",
    "in particular , the davidson - cole  model@xcite introduces the factor @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , which accounts for asymmetry and a smoother dependence of the susceptibility with @xmath23@xmath44 : @xmath50    figure [ 7_davcole ] shows the fit of the measured @xmath3 susceptibility at 90 k to the sum of two davidson - cole  functions , i.e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the values of the jump in @xmath54 for each relaxation process at @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the same value of @xmath57 for both @xmath58 maxima has been used , giving and idea of how broad the distribution is ( @xmath48 = 1 is the debye  law limit ) .",
    "in systems with broad distributions of relaxation times , the relaxation time frequently follows a vogel - fulcher  law.@xcite @xmath59 where t@xmath60 is the so - called vogel - fulcher  temperature , and corresponds to the temperature at which the relaxation process occurs at zero frequency . from the @xmath26  maxima at @xmath23",
    "@xmath44 = 1 , the relaxation time as a function of the temperature can be obtained and from the fit of @xmath44@xmath61 to eq .",
    "[ eq : vf ] t@xmath60 = 70 k is obtained , which is a reasonable temperature for the zero frequency relaxation process to occur .      as mentioned earlier",
    ", @xmath46 follows a curie - weiss  law with temperature and using eq .",
    "[ eq : cw ] the value of the effective moment contributing the susceptibility can be calculated @xmath62 where in this case n is the number of dynamic entities ( i.e. number of clusters ) , t@xmath60 is the temperature calculated form eq .",
    "[ eq : vf ] and @xmath46 can be obtained from both the fits of @xmath24  to davidson - cole  functions and from the @xmath22  measurements .",
    "the obtained value in both cases , @xmath29  @xmath13  20  @xmath12 , is greater than any individual moment present in the system and thus can be only explained as coming from the relaxation process of a group of moments , or cluster .",
    "indeed , this is in good agreement with the reported cluster sizes of 7 8   at @xmath28  from sans experiments",
    "i.e. around 100 co atoms and/or 50 er atoms in the cluster.@xcite however , the obtained effective moment is only compatible with the sans results if the clusters exclusively consist of co low - spin moments .",
    "therefore , if @xmath63 is the number of co atoms in the clusters , the moment of the co atoms in the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0  is @xmath64 .",
    "the results are presented in table [ table : comoments ] , together with the value of the co moment obtained from an independent set of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) experiments presented in ref .",

    "what is more , the presence of an intrinsic co component is needed to explain the relaxation process observed near @xmath28 .",
    "these results are also in agreement with the results from xmcd experiments@xcite as well as with recent first principle calculations carried on erco@xmath0 , which demonstrate the existence of a small but yet significant co moment at high temperatures.@xcite moreover , the existence of a low - spin state for co at at the onset of the ordering temperature of erco@xmath0  was also predicted theoretically by liu and altounian.@xcite our results show that the low - spin state is stable up to temperatures well above the ordering temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of co intrinsic moment in the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0  does not agree with the calorimetric study by imai et al.@xcite , where the co moment shows little influence on the magnetic entropy .",
    "however , the existence of a griffiths - like phase  implies that the co entropy should be released at temperatures much higher than the ordering temperature . on the other hand , the entropy as a function of temperature also discards er moments taking part in the formation of the clusters .",
    "more detailed calorimetric studies in a larger temperature range should be performed on erco@xmath0 , and adequate references like eral@xmath0  and yco@xmath0  should be measured to identify the influence of the formation of the co clusters in the magnetic entropy at high temperatures .",
    "@xmath69 susceptibility measurements as a function of temperature and excitation frequency have been performed in order to study the dynamic properties of the erco@xmath0  paramagnetic phase .",
    "the @xmath22  measurements show the expected curie - weiss  dependence coming from the er independent moments .",

    ".    from the analysis of the @xmath3 susceptibility measurement , together with the already reported existence of magnetic clusters in the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0 , follows that a griffiths - like phase  is formed at temperatures well above the ordering temperature of erco@xmath0 , leading to a handful of new interesting phenomena in this compound .",
    "in particular , the presence of a griffiths - like phase  is related to two new phenomena observed in erco@xmath0 . on one hand ,",
    "the existence of a griffiths - like phase  is related to the anomaly in the paramagnetic @xmath3 susceptibility , which is due to a relaxation process of co clusters . on the other hand",
    ", a previous work showed that the reversal of the co magnetization occurs at a much higher temperature than the ferrimagnetic ordering and that the phenomena can be only observed if there exists co clusters.@xcite the new phenomenology observed in erco@xmath0  is due to a competition of interactions , in which the strong co @xmath70 co exchange interaction plays a very important role , being responsible of the existence of short range order correlations in the paramagnetic phase of erco@xmath0 .",
    "the generalized concept of griffiths - like phases involves an arbitrary distribution of exchange constants , which can be achieved when there are competing interactions in the system toghether with a source of randomess .",
    "however , in erco@xmath0 , the competing interactions acting in the co sublattice are not acompanied by a dissorder in the lattice .",
    "there are two possible sources of dissorder that could percolate the formation of the co clusters , and therefore the formation of the griffiths - like phase . on one hand ,",
    "the appearance of small regions slightly off - stoichiometric is inherent to the synthesis process of the @xmath10co@xmath0  compounds ( see discussion in ref.@xcite and references therein )",
    ". a slighter richer region in co not detectable by x - ray diffraction could be the seed to nucleate the clusters .",
    "although this conjecture can not be ruled out , one would expect that , if that were the case then the phenomena would be sample dependent and radically different in a single crystal . on the other hand",
    ", it is well know that spin fluctuations play a very important role in the co laves phases .",
    "this allows us to postulate that the source of random interactions in erco@xmath0  comes from those spin fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the fits of the sans measurements to a lorentzian function rather than to a lorentzian - squared function , indicates that the co clusters in erco@xmath0  are not inhomogeneous regions of spin ordering but dinamical clusters .",
    "moreover , it is well know that the spins fluctuations are quenched when a magnetic field is applied@xcite , in agreement with the already mentioned extreme sensibility of the griffiths - like phase  to the applied magnetic field .",
    "however , although the occurrence of a griffiths - like phase  in erco@xmath0  has some distinct characteristic , the scenario is very similar to what it has been reported in other intermetallic compounds .",
    "indeed , there is an increasing amount of compounds in which the characteristic fingerprint of griffiths - like phases are now being reported as manganites , rare - earth alloys , heavy - fermion systems , itinerant magnetic semiconductors and now the case of erco@xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore very likely that if the paramagnetic phase of other well studied intermetallic compounds are revisited , several of them would show griffiths  like behavior .",
