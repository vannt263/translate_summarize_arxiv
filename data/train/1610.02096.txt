    "this problem can be solved by using the flavor composition  the ratios of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 to the total flux  to formulate a relative test  @xcite .",

    "our new estimated sensitivity `` ic sens . ''  of @xmath41 s ev@xmath35 far outperforms existing limits .",
    "below , we explain how this is derived .",
    "until recently , studies of decay focused on the triply - degenerate mass scenario ( @xmath42 ) , motivated by the former large allowed mass range . this forced parent and daughter neutrinos to have almost equal masses , the daughter to carry almost the full energy of the parent , and any additional decay product to be massless or very light . as a result ,",
    "the effects depend on whether or not neutrino daughters are active ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison using solar neutrinos ) , and on the particular decay mechanism  @xcite .",
    "past work focused on decay to a daughter neutrino and a massless particle .",
    "such scenarios are strongly restricted by indirect limits from cosmology  @xcite ( or astrophysics  @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mass - vs - lifetime ] reveals a new perspective , spurred by recent progress in measuring neutrino masses . for a fixed @xmath43 , the mass difference @xmath44 rises at lower masses .",
    "because the allowed mass range is low and narrow , that implies that the triply - degenerate scenario is becoming less likely .",
    "this makes our analysis more model - independent . a hierarchical mass scheme , where @xmath45 in the nh and @xmath46 in the ih ( see fig .  1 in ref .  @xcite and fig .  8 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , opens up previously unmotivated possibilities for decay .",
    "it allows us to consider that additional decay products can be massive ( though light ) , and that the cosmological limits may have to be reconsidered . instead of the final state being a non - relativistic neutrino and an additional extreme - relativistic particle ( in the center - of - mass frame of the parent neutrino ) , all possibilities on the kinematics are now allowed .",
    "further , the different kinematics also affects whether or not it is important that neutrino daughters are active .",
    "because of the large mass splitting between parent and daughter neutrinos , the daughter carries only a fraction of the energy of the parent , unlike for the degenerate - mass case .",
    "thus , for falling spectra , daughter neutrinos may be unimportant even if active .",
    "we focus on complete decay , where all unstable neutrinos have decayed upon reaching the detector , imprinting the largest effects . in this scenario",
    ", we do not need to consider branching ratios into individual decay modes .",
    "for concreteness , we consider that the parent neutrino decays into the lightest neutrino and one or more extra particles . in the nh ,",
    "the neutrino component of the decays is @xmath47 ; in the ih , it is @xmath48 .",
    "current data is compatible with a power - law neutrino spectrum , expected from theoretical considerations .",
    "the spectral index with complete decay would be the same as with no decay .",
    "since the flux normalization is _ a priori _ unknown , this allows us to simplify the discussion .",
    "if daughter neutrinos are sterile ( `` invisible '' ) , they will not contribute at all .",
    "if daughter neutrinos are active ( `` visible '' ) , they will contribute some fraction of the parent energy , inheriting the same spectral index .",
    "therefore , with limited data , we are insensitive to whether or not decay products contribute to the detected flux .    we forgo looking for the transition between no decay and complete decay , which would help as an additional observable .",
    "more sophisticated analyses , with more data , could do that , by combining flavor and spectral information  @xcite . if there is a feature in the neutrino spectrum due to decay",
    " or from a cut - off in the emission spectrum  then the properties of daughter neutrinos should be considered more carefully .",
    "decay occurs between mass eigenstates , but neutrino detectors are sensitive to flavor states for the dominant detection channel of neutrino - nucleon charged - current interactions .",
    "mixing between the two bases is large .",
    "it is commonly represented by the pmns matrix @xmath49 and parametrized by three angles  @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  and one cp - violation phase @xmath53 , still unconstrained .",
    "uncertainties in the angles are small and shrinking , but not negligible  @xcite ( also , refs .",

    "because the neutrino flux  a power law , as indicated by data  has a normalization that is _ a priori _ unknown , under complete decay there is no sensitivity to whether or not daughter neutrinos are active and to what fraction of the parent neutrino energy they receive . as a result , there is no sensitivity to different decay modes .",
    "this lack of sensitivity is exploited here to estimate model - independent sensitivities to neutrino lifetime .",
