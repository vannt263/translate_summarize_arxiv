    "an often neglected aspect of interaction - induced galaxy evolution is the possibility of formation of dwarf galaxies out of interaction debris .",
    "the formation of self - gravitating objects in tidal tails was already announced by @xcite .",
    "however some interest in these objects has started growing only in recent years .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxy encounters support two possible scenarios of tidal dwarf formation .",
    "the first one predicts the formation of massive bound condensations dominated by the stellar component along tidal tails and a subsequent infall of gas from the tail into the dwarf s potential well @xcite .",
    "the second one , based on numerical simulations including dissipation for the gaseous component , proposes that the gas condenses first @xcite .",
    "actually , both the stellar and gaseous component are observed in tidal tails and condensations along them .",
    "the formation of condensations of gas and stars has been observed especially at the tips of tidal tails .",
    "a spectacular example is the one of the `` antennae '' ( ngc4038/4039 , schweizer , 1978 ; mirabel , dottori &  lutz 1992 ) , but other examples are shown e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these `` condensations '' in tidal tails of interacting galaxy systems are commonly known as tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) .",
    "they usually share the typical properties of dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs , concerning their surface brightness , blue colors , and strong bursts of star formation , but show somewhat higher metallicities confined in the narrow range 12+@xmath1(o / h ) @xmath2 8.4 - 8.6 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with their formation from material already processed and chemically enriched in the outer disk of the progenitor galaxies and can be a clue to disentangle dwarf galaxies born as tdgs from the population of field dwarf galaxies .",
    "a more restrictive definition of tdgs has been proposed by @xcite , who consider a tdg `` an object which is a self - gravitating entity , formed out of the debris of a gravitational interaction '' .",
    "this restricts such a category of objects to the ones having their own dynamics and a potential well deep enough to allow them to survive disruption for at least 1 gyr .",
    "actually n - body simulations suggest that a substantial fraction of the material ejected during an interaction and accumulated in the tidal tails will slowly fall back into the remnant , allowing only for the outermost part ( e.g. , amounting to 20% in the simulation of ngc7252 by @xcite ) to gain enough kinetic energy to escape and evolve independently for a long time .",
    "studies of poor galaxy groups have revealed the presence of a population of dwarf galaxies in them @xcite , sometimes considerably increasing the number of group members .",
    "also isolated elliptical galaxies that are considered to be relics of compact groups ( cgs ) are surrounded by a population of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is that part of the dwarf galaxies observed in groups is generated in the groups themselves as a by - product of galaxy interactions in these dense environments .",
    "a search for tdgs in cgs led hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky ( 1996 ) to suppose that up to half of the total dwarf population in cgs may be the product of interaction between galaxies .",
    "however the study of @xcite suffers from the lack of kinematic information , which makes it difficult to distinguish `` real '' tdgs from non - self - gravitating condensations in tidal debris .",
    "more restrictive identification criteria applied by @xcite led to the detection of a much lower number of tdgs in cgs .",
    "however the study with most complete information on compact groups tdgs until present is the one by @xcite , which relies on both photometry and kinematics , but is limited to hcg 92 .",
    "they identified in hcg 92 seven candidate tdgs , at least two of which are thought to be able to survive fall - backs into or disruption by the parent galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the brightness enhancements and/or blue condensations we identified as possible tdg candidates during a detailed analysis of the compact galaxy group cg j1720 - 67.8 ( weinberger , temporin , & kerber 1999 ( paper  i ) ; temporin et al .",
    "2003 hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "in particular we perform optical and near - infrared aperture photometry and investigate the physical properties of the identified knots and candidate tdgs through photoionization models calculated with the code cloudy 90.04 @xcite .",
    "considerations about the tidal - tail kinematics are expressed on the bases of spectroscopic data obtained for discrete regions along the tail in addition to integral field spectra sampling its northern part .",
    "the optical colors of the candidate tdgs are compared with the grids of spectrophotometric evolutionary synthesis models by weilbacher et al .",
    "most of the data , on which the present study is based , have already been presented in paper  ii , therefore we only briefly list here the observational material at our disposal .",
    "broad band @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 images ( 900 s , 600 s , and 3@xmath6600 s exposures , respectively ) have been obtained in june 1999 at the eso 3.6 m telescope in la silla .",
    "a number of broad band images was obtained in the near - infrared ( nir ) regime in june 2000 at the 1 m swope telescope in las campanas .",
    "the total integration times were 1800 s in the @xmath7 band , 2000 s in @xmath8 and 2500 s in @xmath9-short ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "details about the reduction steps and the photometric calibration are given in paper ii .",
    "the nir photometric system is described in detail in @xcite . for clarity",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ cmap ] the identification of the candidate tdgs and knots onto the contour maps of the @xmath3 and @xmath5-band images of cg j1720 - 67.8 .",
    "spectra of the candidate tdgs were obtained at the 2.5 m du pont telescope of las campanas with the modular spectrograph and at the eso 3.6 m telescope in la silla , with efosc2 , in multi - object mode ( mos ) .",
    "they all show emission lines with radial velocities in agreement with those of the three main galaxies and -region like diagnostic ratios ( see table  6 and fig .  10 in paper ii ) , although high values of the [ ] /h@xmath11 ratio suggest that shock heating might also be important .",
    "fluxes , the extinction corrected intensities and the estimates of the internal extinction obtained from the balmer decrement were reported in table  3 of paper  ii ( but see also   4 below ) .",
    "the highest extinction value was found for object no .",
    "3 , the candidate tdg at the northern tip of the group s tidal arc ( e ( ) = 0.78 @xmath12 0.42 ) .    additionally ,",
    "we make use of velocity information about object 3 + 9 obtained from recent observations ( june 2002 ) at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope with the integral field unit spiral ( segmented pupil / image reformatting array lens ) and a 600 g / mm grating in the wavelength range @xmath13 6500 - 7120   in combination with the 2048@xmath64096 13.5 @xmath14-sized pixels eev chip .",
    "from an examination of the contour maps in fig .  [ cmap ] , we note that objects 3 , 7 , 10 , and 12 along the tidal arc selected for showing peaks of intensity over the tidal feature where they are embedded show some sort of boundaries .",
    "9 appears like a secondary peak inside the boundaries of no . 3 although this could be an effect of insufficient spatial resolution therefore we consider it as part of object 3 and we will refer to it as object 3 + 9 .",
    "8 appears like a secondary peak adjacent to no . 7 and , although it does not show a clear brightness enhancement with respect to the tidal tail , it emerges as a sort of separated knot in the @xmath5-band image after the application of an adaptive laplacian filter ( fig .",
    "[ laplace ] ) , which has the effect of suppressing the noise and enhancing faint structures @xcite .",
    "5 emerges more clearly as a knot in fig .",
    "[ laplace ] , while it appears as a diffuse structure connected to galaxy 4 in the contour maps of fig .",
    "this object could be a star - forming small tidal tail or perhaps a vestige of a spiral arm .",
    "its color does not differ from that of galaxy 4 , as can be seen in the color map of fig .",
    "[ tdg_col ] ( obtained as described in paper  ii ) .",
    "finally , no .",
    "11 appears as a knot inside a ring - like ( fig .",
    "[ laplace ] ) diffuse structure without any obvious connection with tidal tails . in fig .",
    "[ tdg_col ] all the objects identified along the tidal arc appear bluer than the underlying tidal tail and the adjacent galaxy 4 .    since the features under investigation have irregular elongated shapes , we did not apply traditional circular aperture photometry , which would include too much flux from the surrounding parts of the tidal tail .",
    "instead , we adopted a procedure analogous to the one applied by @xcite and measured total magnitudes inside polygonal apertures .",
    "the apertures were defined on the contour plot of the calibrated @xmath3-band image following the faintest contour , which still allowed to separate each clump from the underlying tidal tail . therefore the surface brightness level at which the aperture was defined was different for each object and the values are listed in table  [ size ] , together with peak surface brightnesses . the same surface brightness levels were taken as reference to measure the size of the clumps . due to the elongated shape of the objects , instead of a typical radius we list in table  [ size ] their minor and major dimensions in kpc , adopting h@xmath15 = 75 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the same polygonal apertures were applied to the aligned images in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 bands .",
    "the nir images were first re - binned to match the pixel scale of the optical ones .",
    "we chose not to subtract the tidal tail contribution from the objects fluxes , but only the sky - background evaluated in several positions as near as possible to the objects of interest .",
    "this choice will allow us to compare our photometric data with the evolutionary synthesis models by @xcite , which take into account also the old stellar population present in the underlying tidal tail .",
    "the total magnitudes and average surface brightnesses inside the polygonal apertures and the optical and nir colors of the clumps are listed in table  [ mag ] .",
    "all the values are corrected for galactic extinction ( e ( ) = 0.088 ) .",
    "we find optical colors ( @xmath2 0.65 - 0.85 ) consistent with those of hcg  92 s tdg candidates @xcite . due to the difficulty to define a clear boundary for the knot no .",
    "5 we give only its surface brightness and colors , but not its total magnitude . for comparison purposes we list",
    "also the average surface brightness and colors of two portions of the tail measured between the clumps .",
    "the brightness of the tail increases slightly from north to south .",
    "typical photometric errors in total optical magnitudes range from @xmath2 0.002 to 0.01 mag , therefore the calibration error ( @xmath2 0.05 , see paper  ii ) is dominating . in the nir photometric errors",
    "are typically @xmath2 0.1 - 0.2 mag but reach 0.6 mag for the faintest objects , nos . 8 and 11 , which could not be measured in the k@xmath17 frame .",
    "although for the candidate tdgs nos . 3 + 9 and 7 we could estimate a significant amount of internal extinction from the balmer decrement ( see paper  ii , table  3 ) , the error in this extinction measurement is high , therefore we preferred not to apply any internal extinction correction to the magnitudes of these objects .",
    "we obtained the following luminosities of the candidate tdgs ( including the light from the underlying tidal tail ) : m@xmath18(3 + 9 ) = @xmath1917.46 , m@xmath18(7 ) = @xmath1917.06 , m@xmath18(8 ) = @xmath1913.93 , m@xmath18(10 ) = @xmath1915.86 ,",
    "m@xmath18(12 ) = @xmath1915.35 , and m@xmath18(11 ) = @xmath1914.39 .",
    "we note that the above luminosities are comparable or higher than those found by @xcite in the candidate tdgs sample of stephan s quintet and those of tdg candidates in interacting systems identified by @xcite .",
    "the two brightest tdg candidates have luminosities higher than the brightest regions measured in sc galaxies by @xcite and more typical of giant extragalactic regions @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison with region properties is made difficult by the different methods of measurement used in the present work and in the literature .",
    "in particular , we need to emphasize that , unlike most published photometric measurements of extragalactic regions , we have used interactively defined polygonal apertures and we did not subtract the flux contributed by the tidal tail , where the knots are embedded , as explained above .",
    "we will further discuss this point later , in   5 .",
    "a number of additional irregularly shaped , faint knots have been identified in the close environment of cg  j1720 - 67.8 , and in particular inside its halo .",
    "their nature is unclear and we have not yet obtained spectral information on them .",
    "however , at least for part of them , we could measure aperture magnitudes in the optical images . in this case",
    "we used circular apertures and evaluated the sky background in an annulus around each object .",
    "these knots are labeled with small - case letters onto the laplacian filtered r - band image in fig .",
    "[ laplace ] .",
    "their optical magnitudes and colors are listed in table  [ knots ] .",
    "some of these objects might belong to a population of dwarf galaxies associated with the compact group , however deeper data and spectral information are necessary to understand it . at present , the group s members among these can not be distinguished from background objects due to the lack of radial velocity information , although their colors could be consistent with background galaxies ( see   6 ) .",
    "the spectra of the candidate tdgs ( nos . 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) and of additional knots of cg  j1720 - 67.8 ( nos . 5 , 11 ) all show a blue continuum ( fig .",
    "[ tdgspec ] ) , and some of them exhibit remarkable balmer absorption lines in addition to the emission lines typical of regions . therefore all their spectral properties agree to indicate a dominating young stellar population and an activity of current / recent star formation .",
    "as already noticed in paper  ii , veilleux & osterbrock s ( 1987 ) ( vo-)diagnostic diagrams applied to these objects confirm that their gas is photoionized by thermal sources although a certain degree of ionization by shock - heating can not be excluded .",
    "also the spectrum of the portion no .",
    "6 of the arc shows balmer absorption lines and weak emission lines ( h@xmath11 , [ ] , and [ ] ) , indicating that a low level of star formation is present in the tidal tail as well , together with an older stellar population .",
    "given the thermal nature of the ionizing source , the h@xmath11 emission - line luminosity , after correction for internal extinction , could be used to evaluate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of these objects . in the spectra nos .",
    "5 and 6 , only a few emission lines were detected , i.e. the blend h@xmath11- [ ] , the [ ] doublet , and for object 5 [ ] @xmath13 3727 .",
    "these were insufficient to locate the regions in the vo - diagnostic diagrams and the lack of a measurable h@xmath20 prevented the estimate of the internal extinction . in this case",
    "we used the uncorrected h@xmath11 luminosities for the sfr estimate .",
    "the star formation rates calculated following @xcite are listed in table  [ sfr ] .",
    "they range from 0.004 to 0.82 m@xmath21 yr@xmath16 , with star formation rate densities ( sfrd ) of 0.05 to 14.15 m@xmath21 yr@xmath16 pc@xmath22 , the highest value being found for the candidate tdg no .",
    "3 and the lowest for knot no .",
    "these sfr values are comparable to those of the tdgs identified in hcg  92 @xcite .",
    "the observed emission - line ratios were used to infer the physical and chemical properties of the ionized gas .",
    "tdgs are expected to have higher metallicities than typical field dwarf galaxies , since they form out of already enriched material ejected by the parent galaxies . since in none of the candidate",
    "tdgs the [ ] @xmath13 4363 emission - line was detected , a direct measurement of the electronic temperature of the emitting gas necessary for the calculation of the metal abundances of the gaseous component was not possible . therefore , in analogy with the method adopted for the three main galaxies of cg  j1720 - 67.8 ( paper ii ) , we obtained a first estimate of the metal abundances of the candidate tdgs by comparing their emission line ratios with the empirical diagrams of @xcite and @xcite . from the comparison with the grid of models of @xcite in the plane [ ] / [ ] _ vs _ r@xmath23 ( r@xmath23 = @xmath1 [ ( [ ] @xmath13 3727 + [ ] @xmath13 4959,5007)/h@xmath24 ) we found that all the candidate tdgs have an ionization parameter in the range @xmath193.5 @xmath25 @xmath1u @xmath25 @xmath193 .",
    "the metal abundances , represented by the o / h ratio , result in the range",

    "object no .",
    "3 could not be compared with these model grids , because the [ ] @xmath13 3727 was not detected in its spectrum .",
    "all the candidate tdgs could be compared with the monotonic relation 12+@xmath1(o / h ) _ vs _ @xmath1 ( [ ] @xmath13 6583/h@xmath11 ) @xcite . by referring to the model track with @xmath1u = @xmath193.0 (",
    "* fig .  1 )",
    ", we found metallicity values in rough agreement with the lowest values given above i.e . with the lower branch of the r@xmath23 - @xmath1(o / h ) relation in @xcite namely @xmath1(o / h ) @xmath2 @xmath193.7 for objects 3 , 8 , and 9 , @xmath1(o / h ) @xmath2 @xmath193.8 for object 7 , and @xmath1(o / h ) @xmath2 @xmath193.9 for object 10 , or , in other words , z @xmath2 0.2 - 0.3 z@xmath2810@xmath29 , n / h = 9.33@xmath610@xmath30 , and s / h = 1.62@xmath610@xmath30 . ] .",
    "these estimates were further refined by fitting the observed emission line ratios with photoionization models by use of the code cloudy  90.04 @xcite . during the fits",
    "the hydrogen density n@xmath31 and the ionization parameter u were let free to vary , while as a typical temperature of the thermal ionizing continuum we assumed t = 4@xmath610@xmath32 k. several models were tried with slightly different metallicity values , until the reproduction of the observed line ratio was satisfactory ( we chose the models with lowest @xmath33 ) .",
    "the final photoionization model parameters are given in table  [ photoion ] , while in table  [ obs - mod ] the observed and modeled emission - line intensities relative to h@xmath20 are compared .",
    "however , also with this procedure the metal abundances of objects 7 , 8 , and 9 could not be uniquely determined .",
    "actually photoionization models with physical parameters similar to those given in table  [ photoion ] but somewhat lower metal abundances would offer a comparably good , or even better fit to the observed line ratios .",
    "the parameters of these alternative models are shown in table  [ alt - photoion ] .    to summarize ,",
    "our candidate tdgs show recent / present star formation activity , and their gaseous component exhibits an ionization parameter u in the range @xmath2 4@xmath610@xmath29 - 7@xmath610@xmath29 , a hydrogen density n@xmath31 in the range @xmath2 1 - 2@xmath610@xmath34 @xmath35 , and metal abundances z @xmath2 0.1 z@xmath28 for object 10 and z @xmath2 0.3 z@xmath28 for objects 3 , 7 , 8 , and 9 , although somewhat lower abundances for the last three might be possible .",
    "especially object 7 could have z @xmath2 0.1 z@xmath28 , but with an overabundance of oxygen and sulphur , which appear to be roughly a third of the solar value . as a comparison we recall here the metal abundances obtained for the three main galaxies of cg  j1720 - 67.8 ( paper  ii ) : z @xmath2 0.2 z@xmath28 for galaxy 1 , z @xmath25 0.5 z@xmath28 for galaxy 2 , and z @xmath2 0.1 z@xmath28 for galaxy 4 .      during june 2002 observations at the anglo - australian telescope equipped with spiral we obtained integral field spectra of the upper part of the tidal arc , where the candidate tdg 3 + 9",
    "is located .",
    "the object was covered with an array of 14@xmath615 microlenses giving a field of view of 9@xmath36.8@xmath610@xmath36.5 with a spatial scale of 0.7 arcsec per microlens per pixel .",
    "the position of the array onto the r - band image of the group is shown in fig .",
    "[ array ] ( left ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with the nod and shuffle technique in order to provide an optimal subtraction of the sky - background .",
    "the total exposure time was 1 hour , half of which was spent on target and the other half on sky .",
    "the wavelength range was centered on the redshifted h@xmath11 line .",
    "the 600r grating combined with the eev ccd - chip gave a dispersion of 0.612   pixel@xmath16 .",
    "the average spectral resolution was in the range 1.8 - 2.3   with the lowest values in the central part of the array and highest values at the borders .",
    "the basic reduction steps involving the tracing of the fibres by use of a flat - field frame , bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , and combination of subsequent exposures were done with the dedicated software 2dfdr , version 2.3 , provided by the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "this software allows also the image reconstruction at a specified wavelength or in a specified wavelength range and was used to reconstruct an h@xmath37continuum image of the field in the range 6800  6900   for object identification purposes .",
    "this image was resampled onto a grid of 56@xmath660 pixels ( i.e. 4 times larger than the original ) and smoothed with a 4@xmath64 pixel box for viewing purposes ( fig .",
    "[ array ] , right ) .",
    "further analysis of the data was carried out within iraf .",
    "specifically , for each spectrum where the h@xmath11 emission line was detected we obtained a radial velocity measurement ( through gaussian fit of the emission - line ) in order to reconstruct the velocity field of the source .",
    "the average calibration error , evaluated from position measurements of oh night - sky lines @xcite , is 2.9 km s@xmath16 . no systematic trends of the error were detected across the 14@xmath615 array of spectra .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ vfield ] . on the left - hand panel",
    "the original reconstructed continuum image ( without resampling ) shows object 3 + 9 in the center and portions of galaxies 2 and 4 at the right edge . on the central image the velocity field , with indicated the maximum and minimum measured radial velocities of the object 3 + 9 ,",
    "shows a velocity gradient in direction ne - sw ( the north - eastern part being the receding one ) across the object , with a maximum velocity difference of @xmath2 200 km s@xmath16 over an extent of @xmath2 5 kpc .",
    "the velocity field is shown also after magnification and resampling ( fig .",
    "[ vfield ] , right - hand panel ) and can be compared with fig .",
    "[ array ] .",
    "there might be several possible explanations for such a gradient ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , like streaming motion along the tidal tail , projection effects , or even rotational motion .",
    "we lack detailed information on the radial velocity gradient along the tidal tail , apart from the discrete measurements in correspondence of objects 7 , 8 , and 10 that indicate that the southern part of the tail is approaching us ( radial velocity @xmath2 13200 km s@xmath16 ) and showing a velocity difference @xmath25 400 km s@xmath16 between the tips of the tail .",
    "however , the tdg candidate 3 + 9 is located at the base of the tail , where tidal streaming and geometric effects are most extreme ( see e.g. the case of the merger remnant ngc 7252 * ? ? ? * their fig .  1 ) .",
    "such effects are likely to be responsible for the observed gradient .",
    "even though , the presence of a rotational motion can not be ruled out .",
    "if the velocity gradient of object 3 + 9 was actually entirely caused by rotation , it would imply a dynamical mass m@xmath38 6@xmath610@xmath39 m@xmath21 , comparable to the mass estimated for the group s galaxy no . 1 @xcite .",
    "this mass , combined with the @xmath3-band luminosity given in   3 , would yield a mass - to - light ratio m@xmath40/l@xmath18 @xmath2 4 .",
    "however , also in case of self - gravitation , the object is unlikely to be in a relaxed state , therefore the application of the virial theorem could lead to a considerable overestimate of its mass .",
    "in the attempt to understand the real nature of the knots in cg  j1720 - 67.8 and to investigate alternative possibilities to the tdg candidate hypothesis , we compare their optical properties with those of normal and giant extragalactic regions ( gehr ) present in the literature . as already stated in ",
    "3 , some difficulties in such a comparison arise as a consequence of different methods of measurement .",
    "in particular the background subtraction is critical when comparing photometric properties .",
    "since most of the published optical photometry of regions is obtained by subtracting the contribution of the underlying galaxy components ( i.e. disk , spiral arms ) , we have estimated the contribution of the tidal tail to the light of our tdg candidates in the @xmath41 bands and subtracted it from the measured fluxes of the knots .",
    "the new set of background - subtracted magnitudes and colors is shown in table  [ no_bkg ] .",
    "the background of each knot was estimated by averaging the mean value inside a number of 10@xmath610 pixel boxes selected all around the polygonal aperture used for the photometry , taking care to avoid the inclusion of adjacent knots .",
    "we stress that the background around the knots has strong gradients , especially at the tips of the tidal tail . therefore , although an as large as possible number of boxes was used for its estimate , the final values we adopted have uncertainties in the range @xmath2 12  40 per cent .",
    "we found that the tidal tail contributes to the flux in the clumps by @xmath2 45 to 60 per cent in @xmath3 , 55 to 68 per cent in @xmath4 , and 52 to 70 per cent in @xmath5 .",
    "the highest percentages are found in the central parts of the arc , while the lowest at the tips of the arc . the maximum contribution from the tail",
    "is observed in the @xmath4 band and the minimum in the @xmath3 band .",
    "such a differential contribution determines the difference between the colors given in table  [ mag ] and those in table  [ no_bkg ] .",
    "the and  colors given in table  [ no_bkg ] can be compared with those measured by @xcite for gehr in a sample of nearby spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "median colors of gehrs and gehr groups in mayya s sample are = 0.21 , = 0.48 and = 0.30 , = 0.44 , respectively , which are consistent with the values we found for our clumps . actually in (",
    "* table  3 ) there are several examples of gehrs with colors very similar to those in our table  [ no_bkg ] . however , their h@xmath11 equivalent widths ( w@xmath42 ) are much higher than the ones we measured in the spectra of our clumps ( table  [ sfr ] ) . furthermore the sizes of gehrs are @xmath25 1.5 kpc , while the clumps in cg  j1720 - 67.8 are considerably more extended ( see table  [ size ] ) .",
    "the properties of the first ranked regions in a sample of nearby spiral and irregular galaxies were studied by @xcite through h@xmath11 photometry .",
    "the brightest ( `` giant '' or `` supergiant '' ) regions in kennicutt s sample were found almost exclusively in late - type normal galaxies or in peculiar galaxies , and the question `` whether they simply represent the high - luminosity tail of the normal region luminosity function or are a physically distinct class of objects formed under special conditions '' appears to remain unanswered .",
    "h@xmath11 luminosities of these regions are in the range 10@xmath4310@xmath44 ergs s@xmath16 and the masses of the embedded star clusters , calculated assuming a salpeter imf and including only stars with masses 10100 m@xmath21 , were expressed as m@xmath45 = 3600 l@xmath46 m@xmath21 ( where l@xmath46 is the h@xmath11 luminosity in units of 10@xmath43 ergs s@xmath16 ) , while the ionized gas mass was found to scale roughly linearly with h@xmath11 luminosity ( at least for the largest regions ) , although the actual value depends on the density @xmath47 according to the relation m@xmath48 = 2.3@xmath610@xmath49 l@xmath46/@xmath47 .    by applying the above relations to our tdg candidates using their",

    "these are only rough estimates and the actual mass values could be larger , since we have used here h@xmath11 luminosities from long - slit spectra , which covered big fractions , but not the full extent of the objects . for comparison ,",
    "the h@xmath11 luminosity of the position 6 along the tidal tail would yield m@xmath45 @xmath2 10@xmath32 m@xmath21 and m@xmath48 of order 10@xmath50 m@xmath21 ( in this case the density could not be determined and the ionized gas mass is estimated through @xcite empirical relation ) .",
    "the equivalent ionizing luminosity of object 3 + 9 reaches 10@xmath53 photons s@xmath16 ( after correction for internal extinction ) .",
    "the properties of the knots along ( and especially at the tips of ) the tidal arc are comparable to those of the giant and supergiant extragalactic regions of kennicutt s sample . we note that h@xmath11 luminosities given in @xcite are not corrected for internal extinction , unlike those in our table  [ sfr ] . however , also before the extinction correction our tdg candidates have @xmath1 h@xmath54 ergs s@xmath16 .    a comparison of h@xmath11 equivalent widths given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  6 ) with those in table  [ sfr ] shows that our tdg candidates are located at the lower limit of the range found for disk regions . furthermore the value measured in the spectrum no .",
    "9 is extremely low and similar to the values measured in spectra nos . 5 and 6 .",
    "this could indicate a non - negligible contribution to the stellar continuum from an underlying evolved stellar population .",
    "the lack of detailed kinematic information ( except for the low - resolution velocity field of the ionized gas in object 3 + 9 ) prevent us from establishing which , if any , of the candidate tdgs we have identified are actually self - gravitating objects i.e .",
    "tdgs in the most rigorous meaning of the term or simply clumps of gas and stars , which are still bound to the tidal tail where they have formed and might eventually evolve into tdgs .",
    "even though , evolutionary synthesis models have proved useful to discriminate between candidate tdgs or tdg progenitors and background objects , and also to estimate the ratio of old to young stellar mass in them @xcite .",
    "therefore we compare here the observational properties of our candidate tdgs with the grids of evolutionary synthesis models published in @xcite .",
    "they have obtained models for two different metallicities , in the range expected for tdgs , i.e. z@xmath55 @xmath2 z@xmath28/18 and z@xmath56 @xmath2 z@xmath28/2.3 , by use of an evolutionary code based on the work of @xcite .",
    "their models assume for tdgs the same undisturbed evolutionary history of the parent galaxies until the onset of the interaction - induced starburst . a @xcite initial mass function is assumed . in the burst the sfr",
    "is set to a maximum value and decreases exponentially with a timescale @xmath57 .",
    "the grids of evolutionary models obtained by @xcite for different burst strengths are represented by counter - clockwise loops in the @xmath58   two - color diagram .",
    "since we have found that our candidate tdgs have metallicities in the range 0.1 z@xmath28 @xmath25 z @xmath25 0.3 z@xmath28 , and in particular oxygen abundances o / h @xmath59 0.35 ( o / h)@xmath28 , we have compared their optical colors with the z@xmath56 models from @xcite .",
    "the observed colors of our candidate tdgs are marked in fig .",
    "[ grid ] onto the two - color diagram adapted from fig .",
    "1c of @xcite .",
    "values corrected only for foreground galactic extinction are marked with crosses .",
    "artificial data - points ( labeled `` a '' , `` b '' , `` c '' , `` d '' , and `` e '' ) from @xcite are plotted , as well ( full circles ) .",
    "in particular point `` b '' corresponds to a burst strength @xmath60 0.1 and a burst age @xmath2 20 myr , point `` c '' indicates a medium to strong burst of much higher age ( @xmath2 80 myr ) , while point `` d '' corresponds to a burst age of @xmath2 7 myr or less , depending on the metallicity .",
    "most of our data - points fall into a region of the two - color diagram where tracks of different models overlap , namely the part of the tracks with burst ages of only a few myrs .",
    "this would indicate that such objects have just started their bursts of star formation .",
    "however , the application of a correction for internal extinction would move the points in the diagram toward older burst ages , reaching the region occupied by the artificial data - point `` b '' , or it would imply stronger bursts",
    ". older burst ages would be in agreement with the observed h@xmath11 equivalent widths ( table  [ sfr ] ) , which are not as high as expected and observed in case of very young ( age @xmath61 2 - 3 myr ) regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the balmer emission - line equivalent width could be lowered as an effect of the presence of an underlying population of stars older than those responsible for the ionization and contributing to the stellar continuum .",
    "internal extinction affecting the emission lines but not the continuum could also play a role in lowering the equivalent width ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although it is not possible to establish the appropriate duration and strength of the bursts due to the similarity of models with @xmath62 in the range 0.05  0.18 and @xmath63 @xmath2 5@xmath610@xmath50 ",
    "1@xmath610@xmath49 yr , object 8 appears consistent with a weaker burst with respect to the other tdg candidates .",
    "object 11 , a condensation in a ring - like structure on the west side of the group , falls near the artificial datapoint `` c '' , suggesting a much higher burst age .",
    "this could be a condensation formed in an already fading tidal tail .    supposing that these tdg candidates will evolve following the tracks in fig",
    ".  [ grid ] , they will become still bluer during the next few myr , then they will become progressively redder , reaching after @xmath2 1 gyr the pre - burst colors .",
    "unless new bursts of star formation are triggered , the objects will progressively fade during their evolution .",
    "their fading can be quantified by comparison with the luminosity evolution modeled by @xcite , which shows a rapid luminosity decrease in the first 50 myrs after the maximum of the burst . in the hypothesis",
    "that they have reached the maximum @xmath3 luminosity at the present epoch , they will fade by about 3.5 mag within 2 gyr .",
    "therefore the brightest clump , no .",
    "3 + 9 , would reach m@xmath18 @xmath2 @xmath1914 and it would be still observable , with an apparent magnitude @xmath3 @xmath2 22.3 . in the same time , the faintest object , no .",
    "8 , would fade to @xmath3 @xmath2 25.9 mag and would be visible only in very deep exposures .",
    "object , no .",
    "11 , according to its estimated burst age of @xmath2 80 myr , should have already faded by @xmath2 2.2 mag with respect to the luminosity peak reached during the burst phase and its @xmath3 luminosity is expected to decrease by another 1.3 mag in the next 1.9 gyr , down to @xmath3 @xmath2 23.2 mag .",
    "the observed colors of the additional knots ` a ' , ` b ' , ` c ' , ` d ' , and ` e ' ( fig . [ laplace ] ) identified in the group s halo would fall far away from the tdg model tracks , therefore , according to @xcite , they could be regarded as background objects .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic observational data of a number of knots and candidate tdgs previously identified ( paper  i and paper  ii ) at the ends of and along the tidal features and in the halo of the ultracompact group cg  j1720 - 67.8 .",
    "although we are not able to establish whether the clumps along the tidal tail are already self - gravitating objects because of the lack of kinematic information with the possible exception of object 3 + 9 whose velocity field shows a regular velocity gradient we have found that their properties are consistent with those expected for tdgs or tdg progenitors .",
    "namely , they show blue colors , recent and/or present - day star formation activity , and relatively high oxygen abundances with respect to field dwarf galaxies . the same properties would also be consistent with star formation within the tail .",
    "indeed we have detected a low level of star formation in a region of the tail where no visible knots are present ( position no .",
    "6 ) and the moderately blue colors of the tail suggest that some degree of star formation is present all along it .",
    "however the star - forming clumps we have identified as candidate tdgs clearly appear as substructures and condensations within the tail and have colors significantly bluer than the surrounding regions .",
    "moreover their luminosities are considerably higher than those typical of normal regions in spiral galaxies and more typical of gehrs .",
    "optical colors as well , once a correction for contamination from the tidal tail material has been applied , are in agreement with those of gehrs @xcite .",
    "actually , optical colors are not sufficient to discriminate between ( giant ) regions and tdgs .",
    "the sizes of most of our candidate tdgs are considerably larger than those of the most extended gehrs , which reach at most @xmath2 1.5 kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "instead they have dimensions typical of dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and comparable to those of the candidate tdgs in stephan s quintet @xcite .",
    "only object no .",
    "8 , judging from its size , might be interpreted as a giant region . at the seeing of our observations ,",
    "the spatial resolution element is @xmath25 1 kpc , which means that a giant region would barely be resolved , while the clumps we observe appear clearly extended .",
    "some of them e.g .",
    "nos . 10 and 12 that appear less concentrated than the objects at the tips of the tail",
    "could be complexes of regions , which appear as an individual clump due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "however , if such complexes form in the tail , their potential well might result deep enough for them to become bound objects that eventually can evolve as dwarf galaxies , provided their mass is sufficient .",
    "in such a case they could be considered as tdgs in the process of formation .",
    "the presence itself of structures in the tail suggests that self - gravitation might play some role .",
    "whether or not the clumps of stars and ionized gas are to become bound objects and even accrete more matter from their surroundings , depends on their having enough mass to survive fall - back into the parent galaxies and tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "the measured optical colors of our candidate tdgs are consistent with evolutionary synthesis tracks calculated for tdgs in the expected metallicity range @xcite .",
    "the positions in the two - color diagrams , when compared with evolutionary tracks , suggests that the objects identified along the group s tidal arc have burst ages of a few myr , while the blue knot no .",
    "11 embedded in a ring - like structure in the group s halo is consistent with a much older burst age ( @xmath2 80 myr ) .",
    "however , the location of the objects in the two - color diagram might be strongly affected by internal extinction , which has not been taken into account due to the high uncertainty in its determination .",
    "the effect could be relevant especially for the objects at the tips of the tail , where indications of higher extinction are found .",
    "the application of an internal extinction correction would move the observational points toward higher burst ages ( up to @xmath2 20 myr ) in the model tracks , thus offering a possible explanation to the relatively low observed h@xmath11 equivalent widths .",
    "if a luminosity evolution analogous to the one modeled by @xcite is assumed , the identified tdg candidates should fade to values of the @xmath3 luminosity still detectable after 2 gyr of evolution , provided they survive as bound objects .",
    "a comparison of the metallicities of the candidate tdgs with those of the three main galaxies in the group does not easily allow to understand which one is the parent galaxy .",
    "actually object no .",
    "10 is the one with lowest metallicity , in agreement with the metal abundances of galaxy 4 ( paper  ii ) . for the other objects",
    "the metallicity value is uncertain , although it seems established that their oxygen abundance is approximately a third of the solar one , therefore higher than that of galaxy 4 .",
    "their parent galaxy might be no .",
    "1 , which exhibits somewhat higher abundances .    a quantitative estimate of the possibility for these objects to survive as individual galaxies against internal motion and tidal forces exerted by",
    "the parent galaxies would require an estimate of their virial and tidal masses @xcite .",
    "the first can not be derived with the presently available data , the latter would require knowledge of the mass interior to their orbit .",
    "since this mass is not known , we limit ourselves to a few qualitative considerations .",
    "we have found that the object composed of no .",
    "3 and no . 9 ( considered together ) is the brightest of the proposed candidate tdgs .",
    "it s velocity gradient , if actually due to rotation , would imply a mass comparable to the one estimated for galaxy 1 @xcite .",
    "if this was the case , its mass could be sufficient for it to escape tidal disruption , despite its unfavorable position in the tidal feature , very nearby to the parent galaxies .",
    "however , the observed velocity gradient could be an effect of streaming motion in combination with projection effects , which can be extreme at the base of the tidal tail .",
    "therefore , no conclusive argument can be given at present .",
    "object no .",
    "7 , although less bright and therefore presumably less massive , seems to be in a more favorable location to survive tidal disruption .    in principle",
    "nir photometry , when combined with optical photometry and equivalent width measurements , should help at least to understand whether the modest luminosity enhancements of our tdg candidates with respect to the surrounding regions of the tidal tail indicate an actual increase of the underlying mass density as expected in case of distinct dynamical entities and not only an increase of the luminosity as a consequence of the burst of star formation .",
    "however the question can not be addressed in a straightforward manner .",
    "not only the optical ( especially @xmath3 ) luminosity is influenced by the recent star formation activity with consequent changes in the m / l ratio , but also the nir luminosity is affected , although in smaller measure .",
    "therefore accurate evolutionary synthesis models , with adequate time resolution , are necessary for a meaningful interpretation of the data .",
    "additionally , the uncertainty in the burst strength and age determination , partly caused by uncertainty in the internal extinction determination as explained above , further complicates the matter .",
    "we will attempt to address this question in a future work .    at present , on the base of the analysis presented here , we can only conclude that the two objects at the tips of the tidal tail ( 3 + 9 and 7 ) appear to be the most promising tdg candidates of the galaxy group .",

    "<S> this is the second part of a detailed study of the ultracompact group cg  j1720 - 67.8 : in the first part we have focused the attention on the three main galaxies of the group and we have identified a number of candidate tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we concentrate on these candidate tdgs . </S>",
    "<S> absolute photometry of these objects in @xmath0 bands confirms their relatively blue colors , as we already expected from the inspection of optical and near - infrared color maps and from the presence of emission - lines in the optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the physical conditions in such candidate tdgs are investigated through the application of photoionization models , while the optical colors are compared with grids of spectrophotometric evolutionary synthesis models from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> although from our data self - gravitation can not be proved for these objects , their general properties are consistent with those of other tdg candidates . </S>",
    "<S> additionally we present the photometry of a few `` knots '' detected in the immediate surroundings of cg j1720 - 67.8 and consider the possibility that these objects might belong to a dwarf population associated with the compact group . </S>"
