    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in optimal control problems for diffusions of mean - field type , where the performance functionals , drifts and diffusions coefficients depend not only on the state and the control but also on the probability distribution of state - control pair .",
    "most formulations of mean - field type control in @xcite have been of risk - neutral type where the performance functionals are the expected values of stage - additive payoff functions . not all behavior , however ,",
    "can be captured by risk - neutral mean - field type controls .",
    "one way of capturing risk - averse and risk - seeking behaviors is by exponentiating the performance functional before expectation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a stochastic maximum principle ( smp ) for the risk - sensitive optimal control problems for markov diffusion processes with an exponential - of - integral performance functional was elegantly derived in @xcite using the relationship between the smp and the dynamic programming principle ( dpp ) which expresses the first order adjoint process as the gradient of the value - function of the underlying control problem .",
    "this relationship holds only when the value - function is smooth ( see assumption ( b4 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the approach of @xcite was widely used and extended to jump processes in @xcite and @xcite , but still under this smoothness assumption . however , in many cases of interest , the value function is , in the best case , only continuous .",
    "moreover , the relationship between the smp and the dpp does not hold for non - markovian dynamics and for mean - field type control problems where the bellman optimality principle does not hold .",
    "this calls for the need to find a risk - sensitive smp for these case .    the only paper that we are aware of and which deals with risk - sensitive optimal control in a mean field context is @xcite .",
    "therein , the authors derive a verification theorem for a risk - sensitive mean - field game whose underlying dynamics is a markov diffusion , using a matching argument between a system of hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations and the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this matching arguments freezes the mean - field coupling in the dynamics , which yields a standard risk - sensitive hjb equation for the value - function .",
    "the mean - field coupling is then retrieved through the fokker - planck equation satisfied by the marginal law of the optimal state .",
    "our contribution can be summarized as follows .",
    "we establish a stochastic maximum principle for a class of risk - sensitive mean - field type control problems where the distribution enters only through _ the mean of state process_. this means that the drift , diffusion , running cost and terminal cost functions depend on the state , the control and on the mean of state .",
    "our work extends the results of @xcite to risk - sensitive control problems for dynamics that are non - markovian and of mean - field type .",
    "our derivation of the smp does not require any relationship between the first - order adjoint process and a value - function of an underlying control problem .",
    "using the smp derived in @xcite , our approach can be easily extended to the case where the mean - field coupling is in terms of the mean of the state and the control processes .    to the best to our knowledge",
