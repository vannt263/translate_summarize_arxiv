    "<S> in two different phase transition models of nuclear fragmentation we show that the emission of pre - equilibrium particles and mixing of events from different classes can not be ignored in the analysis of nuclear fragmentation data in terms of critical exponents , and we show how the apparent values of the extracted exponents are affected .    </S>",
    "<S> the premier goal of medium and high energy heavy - ion reactions is the exploration of the nuclear phase diagram . on theoretical grounds we expect infinite nuclear matter to undergo at least two distinct phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> one is the deconfinement or quark - gluon - plasma phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the other is a  liquid - gas \" type phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed to be of first order , terminating at the critical point in a second order transition . in nuclear multifragmentation reactions </S>",
    "<S> one attempts to map out the liquid - gas coexistence region and locate the critical point .    </S>",
    "<S> the first dataset to be interpreted in terms of critical exponents resulted from proton - induced spectator - fragmentation of krypton and xenon targets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was later shown in the framework of the percolation model @xcite that value of the  </S>",
    "<S> critical \" exponent @xmath0 observed in @xcite was predominantly a result of mixing of different event classes and integration over impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , similar power - law behavior was seen in classical reaction dynamics simulations , where it was shown to be inconsistent with matter going through the critical point @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a significant step forward was then taken by performing event - by - event analysis of the moments of the mass- or charge - distributions of the fragments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this analysis of emulsion data suggested that nuclei break up similar to percolation clusters @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was hoped that the problem of impact parameter selection would be less severe and therefore the critical exponents easier to extract for participant fragmentation in symmetric heavy ion collisions . by focussing on very central collisions as a function of beam energy , a minimum of the fit parameter @xmath1 , with @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> was observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this confirmed similar observations obtained from reverse - kinematics reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it had been predicted that this minimum would correspond to the actual value of the critical exponent @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , theoretical calculations showed that there may be significant topology effects such as the formation of bubbles and toroids @xcite at work , changing the values of the measured exponents @xcite .    at present , </S>",
    "<S> significant effort is also directed at the study of the moments of the fragment charge distribution in reverse - kinematics reactions , where the rise and fall of multifragmentation was observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently the eos tpc collaboration used the reaction 1 agev au + c in an attempt to reach the critical point of nuclear matter and determine the critical exponents in the spectator fragmentation of the residue of the gold nucleus @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is generally agreed that the fragmentation process in proton - induced or reverse - kinematics reactions proceeds in two steps  a first pre - equilibrium step in which the participants interact and deposit excitation energy into the spectators , and a second equilibrium step in which the excited ( and hopefully equilibrated ! ) spectator residue decays . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a hybrid model , in which the pre - equilibrium energy deposition and resulting residue size are calculated in the framework of an intra - nuclear cascade ( inc ) model @xcite , and in which we calculate the decay of the residue within a percolation model @xcite or statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite framework . for </S>",
    "<S> any given impact parameter the inc provides the charge and mass as well as the excitation energy per nucleon of the spectator residue by calculating a sequence of individual nucleon - nucleon collisions and single - particle removals from the nuclear potential well . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that in central collisions the average residue charge is less than 49 , implying the emission of 30 pre - equilibrium charges .    </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy can be converted into a percolation bond - breaking probability via @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the generalized incomplete gamma function , @xmath5 is the binding energy per nucleon in the residue ( taken as 6 mev here ) , and @xmath6 is the temperature as calculated from the inc model , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the smm is microcanonical statistical multifragmentation model where the decay probabilities into channel @xmath8 is proportional to the statistical weight @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the entropy in channel @xmath8 . in the smm </S>",
    "<S> we used a standard set of parameters applied before for analysis of multifragmentation in peripheral heavy - ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the break - up density is assumed to be 1/3 of the normal nuclear density .    </S>",
    "<S> we then arrive at the final inclusive mass distribution ( and its moments ) as follows : for any given event we select an impact parameter with geometrical probability weighting , calculate @xmath11 and the pre - equilibrium multiplicity , @xmath12 , within the inc stage , and then use this @xmath13 and residue charge , @xmath14 , to obtain the multiplicity , @xmath15 , ( and charge / mass distribution ) of the equilibrium particles from the percolation stage or smm stage . </S>",
    "<S> the total multiplicity is then @xmath16 . a standard integration over impact parameter yields the desired distributions . within the assumptions stated above </S>",
    "<S> , both hybrid models are then free of adjustable parameters .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 we compare the results of our models to the data of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> displayed is the second moment of the charge distribution , computed event - by - event , and averaged over all events with identical total charged particle multiplicity , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the number of fragments of charge @xmath19 emitted in event @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the total charged particle multiplicity of this event . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 is a summation over all events and @xmath23 is the usual kronecker-@xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is the upper cutoff used in the summation over all fragment charges . </S>",
    "<S> here we should point out the usefulness of displaying multiplicity - sorted data of @xmath26 by including and excluding the largest , 2@xmath27-largest , 3@xmath28-largest ,  fragment . </S>",
    "<S> this information is available in a model - independent way , and it shows the most probable partition of the system in each multiplicity bin . in the eos data </S>",
    "<S> @xcite displayed here ( circles ) only part of this important information is given : the largest fragment was included for multiplicities above 26 and excluded below . for the models we display in the lower curves @xmath26 excluding the largest fragment and in the higher curves including the largest fragment for all multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> fission events were eliminated from both the data and the calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe an astonishing degree of agreement between the results of the inc / percolation hybrid ( histogram ) and the data for all multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> we should point out here that the fragmentation of a @xmath29 residue with the same excitation energy distribution results in average moments very different from the data , indicating the importance of the emission of pre - equilibrium charged particles for this observable . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we performed a calculation fragmenting a @xmath29 residue at a fixed excitation energy corresponding to the critical point of the percolation model . </S>",
    "<S> this resulted in events distributed over the multiplicity interval from 12 to 28 , having approximately constant values of @xmath30 when excluding and @xmath31 when including the largest fragment . </S>",
    "<S> this also indicates the importance of mixing between events of different excitation energy classes in the observed values of the moments .    </S>",
    "<S> the inc / smm hybrid shows also qualitatively the same features as the data , but is generally too high on the lower branch and too low on the upper branch by about a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> presumably one could generate better agreement for the inc / smm by fitting an excitation energy and residue size distribution to the data along the method used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is not the goal of the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> rather we would like to point out that the data and both models have similar slopes of @xmath32 versus @xmath33 over the entire multiplicity interval . </S>",
    "<S> these slopes were used by the eos collaboration to extract the </S>",
    "<S>  critical \" exponent @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this is even more obvious in fig .  2 , where we display @xmath35 as a function of @xmath36 with @xmath37 , according to the analysis of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that data and both models have roughly parallel `` liquid '' and `` gas '' branches over the interval displayed here . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contradiction to the analysis of @xcite , we do not recover the known critical exponent @xmath34 ( = 1.8 ) of the percolation model from this figure . </S>",
    "<S> instead both models yield about ` @xmath34'=1.4 , in accordance with the experimental observation .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed an analysis of the size of largest fragment as a function of the total multiplicity . from an analysis like this , </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite claim to have extracted the critical exponent @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , one of us @xcite pointed out that the presence of pre - equilibrium particles may change the value of the extracted apparent exponent . within the framework of the present hybrid models we can now perform a quantitative comparison to the data , as shown in fig .  3 . performing a linear regression fit to the output of the inc / percolation model in the interval shown </S>",
    "<S> yields a slope of ` @xmath38'=0.35 , reasonably close to the value of 0.29@xmath390.02 extracted from the data , and not close to the nominal value of @xmath38=0.41 for the percolation model . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the inc / smm output yields ` @xmath38'=0.50 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is dangerous to interpret these exponents extracted in the above way as the true critical exponents characterizing the universality class of the actual nuclear phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> three effects play important roles in this : the extreme finite size of the fragmenting system , the use of @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) for the abscissa , and , most importantly , the mixing of different event classes of size and excitation in the same multiplicity bin . </S>",
    "<S> this mixing is caused by the use of inclusive , impact parameter integrated data with different admixtures of pre - equilibrium particles .    </S>",
    "<S> the mixture of events with different `` temperature '' into the same multiplicity bins represents a convolution @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the physical observable as a function of multiplicity and temperature , and @xmath46 is the ( integral normalized ) number distribution function of events with a given temperature and multiplicity . in fig .  4 , we show @xmath46 as a contour plot for the inc / percolation model . </S>",
    "<S> each contour level represents a factor of 2 higher value than the one surrounding it . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see that @xmath46 is rather broad , indicating a large degree of mixing of events with different temperature into the same multiplicity bin .    </S>",
    "<S> while the scaling laws of critical behavior are valid for @xmath45 in the vicinity of the critical point , no such statement can _ a priori _ be made for the same observable as a function of the multiplicity . to accomplish this , the inverse of the convolution function </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath47 has to be known . for obvious reasons </S>",
    "<S> , the function @xmath46 can not be extracted from data in a model - independent way , and therefore the inverse is also not accessible . </S>",
    "<S> for all these reasons , a precise model - independent determination of critical exponents , as suggested in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is not correct .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> taking the data of the eos collaboration we have shown that an interpretation in terms of critical phenomena should be carried on very carefully . </S>",
    "<S> mixing of different event classes into the same multiplicity bins and the contributions of pre - equilibrium particle emission make a model - independent extraction of critical exponents questionable .    </S>",
    "<S> what is possible , however , is a detailed comparison of the data to models which include pre - equilibrium as well as equilibrium components , and which emulate as closely as possible the experimental trigger conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we have used two of the models here to perform this kind of comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we have found , e.g. , that the inc / percolation model achieves surprising agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the kind employed in @xcite for the model output yields apparent exponents of ` @xmath38'=0.35 and ` @xmath34'=1.4 , whereas the known critical exponents for 3d - percolation in the infinite size limit are @xmath38=0.41 and @xmath34=1.8 . </S>",
    "<S> the next step , in our opinion , could be analysis of exclusive events aimed at finding actual equilibrated residues . </S>",
    "<S> after that we can really investigate manifestations of the phase transition in the residue - nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> there is hope that this direction of research will be fruitful . </S>",
    "<S> the rather surprising agreement of the inc / percolation model ( which explicitly contains a phase transition ) with the data given rise to this hope .    </S>",
