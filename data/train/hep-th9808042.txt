    "in @xcite it was shown that the combinatorics of the subtraction procedure inherent to perturbative renormalization gives rise to a hopf algebra @xmath0 which provides a conceptual framework to understand the intricacies of the forest formula of zimmermann .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the delicate computational problem which arises from the transverse hypoelliptic theory of foliations , as formulated in noncommutative geometry , can only be settled thanks to a hopf algebra @xmath1 associated to each integer codimension .",
    "this hopf algebra reduces transverse geometry , to a universal geometry of affine nature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish a close relation between the above hopf algebras @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we shall first recall the first results of @xcite which describe in the simplest case of codimension @xmath2 the presentation of the hopf algebra @xmath1 .",
    "we shall then explain the origin of the hopf algebra @xmath0 from the renormalization of the divergences of qft and show following @xcite how @xmath3 is used in concrete problems of renormalization theory .",
    "in the appendix we include the case of overlapping divergences .",
    "we then give the presentation of the simplest model of @xmath0 namely the hopf algebra of rooted trees , and show that it is uniquely characterized as the solution of a universal problem in hochschild cohomology .",
    "we then determine the formal lie algebra @xmath4 such that @xmath0 is obtained as the dual of the envelopping algebra of this lie algebra .",
    "it turns out to be a refinement of the lie algebra of formal vector fields in one dimension .",
    "we then show that many of the results of @xcite actually extend to this refinement of formal vector fields .",
    "these results indicate that parallel to the ordinary differential calculus which underlies the transverse structure of foliations , the recipes of renormalization theory should be considered as a refined form of calculus and should be understandable on a conceptual ground .",
    "concretely , in the first section we show in theorem ( 8) that the algebraic rules of the hopf algebra @xmath1 are the expression of the group law of composition of diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 in terms of the coordinates @xmath6 given by the taylor expansion of @xmath7 at @xmath8",
    ". in particular this shows that the antipode in @xmath1 is , modulo a change of variables , the same as the operation of inversion of a formal power series for the composition law .    in the second section we begin by the simplest and most explicit examples of divergent integrals of the kind that are met in quantum field theory computations .",
    "we describe in this toy case the explicit counterterm construction and the immediate problem which arises from divergent subintegrations and explain how the hopf algebra @xmath0 finds the combinatorial solution of the subtraction problem from its antipode .",
    "we next explain why the same holds in qft ( the treatment of overlapping divergences is postponed to the appendix ) .    in the third section we exhibit the precise relation and analogy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the point that the antipode in @xmath0 appears as a direct analogue of the antipode in @xmath1 which we understood above as the inversion of formal power series .",
    "the key nuance between the two hopf algebras is that where @xmath1 uses integers to label the taylor expansion , the hopf algebra @xmath0 uses rooted trees for labels .",
    "the computation of the local index formula for transversally hypoelliptic operators ( @xcite ) is governed by a very specific hopf algebra @xmath1 , which only depends upon the codimension @xmath9 of the foliation .",

    "@xmath260 is a connected and simply - connected set of oriented edges and vertices such that there is precisely one distinguished vertex with no incoming edge .",

    "we consider the algebra of polynomials over @xmath275 in rooted trees .",
    "note that for any rooted tree @xmath260 with root @xmath265 we have @xmath276 trees @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 which are the trees attached to @xmath265 .",

    "the monomial which is delivered by the @xmath293 other factors is denoted by @xmath294 .",
    "the definitions of @xmath295 can be extended to monomials of trees in the obvious manner , by choosing a cut @xmath296 for every tree @xmath291 in the monomial : @xmath297    we have now collected a sufficient amount of structure to define a hopf algebra on rooted trees .",
    "our aim is to see the correspondence between the hopf algebra formulated on rooted trees and the generation of a local counterterm for the functions @xmath259 introduced above , and finally to see the correspondence between the hopf algebra of rooted trees and the hopf algebra of the previous section .",
    "before we define the hopf algebra of rooted trees , we leave it as an exercise to the reader to convince himself that any admissible cut in a rooted tree determines in the representation on functions @xmath259 a divergent subintegration , and that vice versa any divergent subintegration corresponds to an admissible cut .",
    "for example , the single cut possible at @xmath271 corresponds to the single divergent subintegration in this function .",

    "the reader should work out the examples in fig.(6 ) himself .",
    "one checks coassociativity of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "also , we will give a formal proof in the next section .",
    "the following statement follows directly from the results in the next section , but it is instructive to prove it here by elementary means to make contact with the previous section .",

    "the induction is on the number of vertices .",
    "we use that @xmath304 has @xmath9 vertices if @xmath260 has @xmath305 .",
    "thus , @xmath306 we used the fact that @xmath307 and that the only cut which distinguishes @xmath308 from @xmath309 is the cut which generates @xmath310 .",
    "@xmath29    note that the above formula can be streamlined .",
    "@xmath311 where the primed sum indicates that we include the empty cut and the full admissible cut in the definition of admissible cuts in the manner indicated in fig.([cop ] ) .",
    "any cut corresponds to a choice of a subset of edges on the set @xmath312 of all edges of a given rooted tree @xmath260 .",
    "the empty cut @xmath313 corresponds to the empty set in this sense .",
    "thus , @xmath314 @xmath315    the full admissible cut @xmath316 is defined by the complementary result : @xmath317 @xmath318 it can be regarded as a cut @xmath220 on the one new edge of @xmath319 , defined as the intersection @xmath320 .",

    "we mentioned already that a cut on a tree @xmath260 is given by a subset of the set @xmath312 of the set of edges of @xmath260 .",
    "so far , we allowed for a restricted class of subsets , corresponding to admissible cuts .",
    "we actually enlarged the set already and considered the set @xmath327 of all edges of @xmath319 , to construct the full admissible cut .",
    "we now consider all cuts corresponding to this set , that is all possible subsets of @xmath327 , including the empty set .",
    "these subsets fall in two classes , one which contains the edge @xmath328 , one which does not contain this edge .",
    "cuts corresponding to the first class we call full cuts , cuts not containing this distinguished edge we call normal cuts .",
    "thus , the empty cut is a normal cut .",
    "non - empty normal cuts are also called proper cuts .",
    "note that for a given normal cut @xmath329 and the corresponding full cut @xmath330 we have @xmath331 @xmath332 while @xmath333 , where @xmath334 is the cardinality of the set @xmath289 .",
    "let us give yet another formula to write the antipode , which one easily derives using induction on the number of vertices : @xmath335    this time , we have a non - recursive expression , summing over all full cuts @xmath289 , relaxing the restriction to admissible cuts .",
    "we introduced full cuts so that the overall sign agrees with the number of cuts employed .    note that we have for all @xmath336 @xmath337 = \\sum_{\\mbox{\\tiny all cuts",

    "by now we have established a hopf algebra on rooted trees .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the coproduct and antipode for some simple trees .",
    "figs.([cop],[ant ] ) give examples .",
    "note that in fig.([ant ] ) we represented cuts as boxes .",
    "this is possible in a unique way , as each cut on a simply connected rooted tree can be closed in the plane to a box without further intersecting the tree and so that the root is in the exterior of the box . at this time",
    "we can make contact to the previous section .",
    "we note that the sum of the two trees with three vertices behaves under the coproduct as the element @xmath339 in the first section . defining @xmath340",
    ", we find @xmath341 in accordance with eq.([eq10 ] ) in the previous section .",
    "this is no accident , as we will soon see .",
    "the reader should also check the formulas for the coproduct and antipode on examples himself .",
    "it is now not difficult to employ this hopf algebra to regain the local counterterms for the toy model . by construction",
    ", subdivergent sectors correspond to admissible cuts .",
    "also , forests in the sense of renormalization theory are in one to one correspondence with arbitrary cuts , with full cuts corresponding to full forests , and normal cuts to normal forests .",
    "this allows to recover local counterterms from the formula for the antipode in our hopf algebra .",
    "the recursive and the non - recursive manner to write the antipode give rise to two equivalent formulas for the local counterterm , as it is standard in renormalization theory @xcite .",
    "to see all this , note that any cut defines a natural bracket structure on @xmath342 . in a moment",
    "we will see how this fact allows to introduce various different renormalization schemes @xmath343 .",
    "it is instructive to come back to the toy model .",
    "fig.([toyr ] ) summarizes how the standard notions of renormalization theory derive from the hopf algebra of rooted trees .    in fig.([toyr ] ) we see the tree @xmath344 , corresponding to the function @xmath345 .",
    "the antipode @xmath346 derives from full cuts which induce the following bracket structure on toy model functions : @xmath347+[[x_{t_2}(c)]x_{t_1}(c)]+[[x_{t_1}(c)]x_{t_2}(c ) ] -[[[x_{t_1}(c ) ] x_{t_1}(c ) ] x_{t_1}(c)].\\ ] ] there is a certain freedom how to evaluate this bracket structure .",
    "such a freedom is always there in renormalization .",
    "it corresponds to a choice of renormalization map @xmath343 in the notation of @xcite , while in collins textbook @xcite it corresponds to the choice of the map @xmath348 which extracts the divergent part of a given expression .",

    "note that the only reason that the renormalized function @xmath352 does not vanish identically is that full cuts involve one more bracket evaluation than normal cuts .",
    "as the bracket evaluation respects the divergent part , it is clear that functions @xmath352 must be finite , due to the very fact that @xmath353 $ ] involves a sum over all cuts in pairs of normal cuts and associated full cuts .",
    "this gives rise to a sum of pairs of contributions , each pair being a difference @xmath354 $ ] between an analytic contribution @xmath11 and its bracket evaluation .",
    "thus , as long as the bracket evaluation respects the divergent part of @xmath11 , we will obtain a finite result for @xmath355 .",
    "let us now turn away from toy models and address qfts . by its very definition , pqft deals with the calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "as such , it confronts the problem of the presence of ultraviolet divergences in the diagrams .",
    "hence , the diagrams refer to ill - defined analytic quantities .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the analytic expressions provided by the diagrams become laurent series in a regularization parameter .",
    "the presence of pole terms in this laurent series then indicates the presence of uv - divergences in the first place .",
    "equivalently , in the bphz spirit , we can taylor expand the integrand in external momenta and would find that the first few terms are ill - defined quantities .",
    "the art of obtaining meaningful physical quantities from these laurent series is known as renormalization .",
    "it is in this process that we will find the hopf algebra structure realized .",
    "let us recall a few basic properties of renormalization .",
    "feynman diagrams consist of edges ( propagators ) and vertices of different types . to each such type",
    "we can assign a weight , and to a feynman diagram we can assign an integral weight called _ degree of divergence _ which can be calculated from the dimension of spacetime , the numbers of closed cycles in the feynman diagram , and the weights of its propagators and vertices .",
    "one finds that the analytic expression provided by a feynman diagram under consideration provides uv - divergences if and only if its degree of divergence @xmath356 is @xmath357 .",
    "one speaks of logarithmic , linear , quadratic , @xmath278 divergences for @xmath358 .",
    "a feynman diagram usually contains subdiagrams , which have their own degree of divergence , and thus might provide uv - divergent analytic expressions by themselves .",
    "all these divergences are to be compensated by local counterterms , which are to be calculated from a feynman graph and its divergent subgraphs .",
    "fig.([exa2 ] ) shows how the previous discussion extends to a feynman graph with one subdivergent graph .",
    "it is the main result of @xcite that the transition from a bare feynman diagram to its local counterterm , and to the renormalized feynman graph , is described by a hopf algebra structure . in this paper , we have changed the notation of @xcite and formulate the hopf algebra on rooted trees .",
    "a glance at fig.([exa ] ) shows how to assign a rooted tree to a feynman graph with subdivergences .",
    "this is possible in a unique manner as long as all subdivergences of the feynman graph are either disjoint or nested @xcite . in such circumstances",
    ", we can associate a unique rooted tree to the graph .",
    "if the subdivergences are overlapping , the renormalization will nevertheless follow the combinatorics dictated by the hopf algebra of rooted trees .",
    "in such circumstances , a feynman graph corresponds to a sum of rooted trees @xcite .",
    "we will comment on this fact in an appendix .",
    "each feynman diagram @xmath213 furnishes a tree whose vertices are decorated by feynman graphs @xmath359 which are free of subdivergences themselves .",
    "these decorations correspond to the letters in the parenthesized words of @xcite .",
    "note that the set of all admissible cuts is by construction in one to one correspondence with the set of all superficially divergent subgraphs of @xmath213 .",
    "further the set of all cuts is in one to one correspondence with the set of all forests in the sense of renormalization theory .",
    "this is the main result of @xcite .",
    "the antipode of the hopf algebra @xmath360 delivers the @xmath361-factor of a feynman diagram .    at this stage",
    ", we can summarize the results in @xcite using the language of the hopf algebra of rooted trees .",
    "this is done in fig.([renormalization ] ) .",
    "note that we even do not have to specify the renormalization scheme , but that the cuts used in the definition of the antipode on rooted trees extend to forests , so that we can apply any chosen renormalization prescription to evaluate the content of these forests .",
    "thus , as before in the toy model , each cut corresponds to the operation @xmath348 in collins book @xcite , some operation which extracts the divergence of the expression on which it acts .",
    "as we mentioned already , this operation was called @xmath343 in @xcite .    at this point , we succeeded in deriving the renormalization procedure from the hopf algebra of rooted trees .",
    "the attentive reader will have noticed that we ignored overlapping divergences in our discussion .",
    "as promised , we will discuss them in an appendix , where it is shown how to assign a unique sum of rooted trees to any graph containing overlapping divergences , to which then our previous considerations apply .    for us ,",
    "these considerations of renormalization and the underlying hopf algebra of rooted trees are sufficient motivation to get interested in this hopf algebra .",
    "we will continue our exploration of this subject by showing how it relates to the hopf algebra of the first section .",
    "we saw some of these relations already , and now continue to make this more precise .",
    "recall the relations @xmath341 which indicate an intimate connection to the hopf algebra @xmath1 introduced in the first section . to find the general relation between the two hopf algebras under consideration we first introduce naturally grown forests @xmath363 .    to this end",
    ", we consider an operator @xmath364 which maps a tree @xmath260 with @xmath9 vertices to a sum @xmath365 of @xmath9 trees @xmath366 , each having @xmath305 vertices , by attaching one more outgoing edge and vertex to each vertex of @xmath260 , as in fig.([ng ] ) .",
    "the root remains the same in this operation .",
    "now we define @xmath367 so that @xmath368 . on products of trees",
    "@xmath364 will act as a derivation , comparable to the derivation @xmath111 introduced in eq.([eq29 ] ) .    in fig.([ng ] ) we see the first few elements @xmath363 . note that there are non - trivial multiplicities as in @xmath369 .",

    "thus , @xmath374",
    "hence we can write , with the same @xmath366 as before , @xmath375\\otimes r^{c^i}(t_i)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left . + ( p^{c^i}(t_i)\\otimes n[r^{c^i}(t_i)]\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\   & & + n\\delta_1\\otimes \\delta_n\\nonumber\\\\   & &   + \\sum_i \\sum_{\\mbox{\\tiny all cuts $ c^i$ of $ t_i$ } } l[r^{c^i}(t_i)]\\delta_1 p^{c^i}(t_i)\\otimes r^{c i}(t_i),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where l(t ) gives the number of vertices of a tree @xmath260 .",
    "thus , we decomposed the cuts at the components of @xmath376 in four classes : either the edge to the new grown vertex is not cut , then we will have natural growth on either the former @xmath377 or @xmath378 part .",
    "thus , the first two contributions deliver the operator @xmath364 on either side of the tensorproduct . or , for the remaining two cases , the edge to the new grown vertex is cut .",
    "these cases will always have a factor @xmath379 on the lhs of the tensorproduct .    in these cases , it either was grown from the former @xmath378 part ( admissibility of cuts forbid that it was grown from the @xmath377 part ) , or it was grown from the whole uncut former @xmath6 , which gives the term @xmath380 .",
    "hence we have decomposed the cuts possible at the trees of @xmath376 in terms of the cuts at the trees of @xmath6 .",
    "fig.([instrr ] ) gives an instructive example . to finally prove the result , we note the following identities @xmath381\\\\     l(\\delta_k)\\delta_k & = & k \\delta_k=[y,\\delta_k],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we note that @xmath382=k$ ] is well - defined , as @xmath363 is a homogenous combination of trees with @xmath383 vertices .  @xmath29    at this stage , we begin to see a fundamental connection between the process of renormalization and the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , we will now set out to define the hopf algebra of rooted trees more formally and repeat the analysis of @xcite for it .",
    "we shall formalize the simplest example from the last section as the hopf algebra of rooted trees , and extend many of the results of the first section to this more involved case .    by a rooted tree @xmath348 we mean a finite , connected , simply connected , one dimensional simplicial complex with a base point @xmath384 @xmath385 .",

    "@xmath658}_n(q;0)$ ] has the form @xmath676}_n(q;0)=(q^2)^{1-n\\epsilon}f_{g_n}(\\epsilon)\\ ] ] where @xmath681 is a laurent series in @xmath222 .",
    "hence @xmath658}_n(q;0)$ ] fulfils the differential equation @xmath682}_n(q;0)=g^{[2]}_n(q;0).\\ ] ] this solves the problem .",
    "the remaining source of overlapping divergences , @xmath658}_n(q;0)$ ] , is expressed in terms of the overall logarithmic divergent function @xmath683}_n(q;0)$ ] which is free of overlapping divergences .",
    "such an approach is also very useful in practice @xcite .",
    "fig.([f2 ] ) gives two examples for the resolution of overlapping divergences .",
    "crosses in the figure indicate where the derivatives with respect to @xmath241 act for a chosen momentum flow through the graph .",
    "so far , we decomposed graphs which have overlapping divergences into a sum of contributions each of which delivers a rooted tree .",
    "thus , overlapping divergences correspond to a linear combination of rooted trees , while any feynman diagram without overlapping divergences corresponds to a single rooted tree .",
    "one might suggest to enlargen the hopf algebra @xmath684 of rooted trees to another hopf algebra , @xmath685 say , so that @xmath685 directly contains elements which correspond to graphs with overlapping divergences @xcite .",
    "let us at this stage mention a general fact which shows that any such hopf algebra @xmath685 is nothing else than the hopf algebra of rooted trees .",
    "if we take into account the decorations of vertices by feynman diagrams without subdivergences , any such hopf algebra @xmath685 is a hopf algebra @xmath684 for an appropriate set of decorations .",
    "consider a feynman graph @xmath213 which has overlapping subdivergences , but in a way that any of its divergent subgraphs @xmath686 and any of the complementary graphs @xmath687 is free of overlapping subdivergences .",
    "the first example in fig.([f2 ] ) is of this type .",
    "the cases we have excluded here will be handled later by a recursive argument .",
    "we want to construct a hopf algebra @xmath685 which contains a single element @xmath688 such that the antipode @xmath689 delivers the counterterm without making recourse to the methods of the previous paragraph to disentangle @xmath688 first as a sum of trees @xmath366 in some decorated algebra @xmath684 .",
    "the question is : could such an algebra have a structure different from @xmath684 ?",
    "let us actually construct @xmath685 by fairly general arguments .",
    "let @xmath690 be given , and let in particular all feynman graphs without subdivergences be identified .",
    "hence all possible decorations , and thus all primitive elements of @xmath684 are assumed to be determined .",
    "note that the primitive elements of @xmath685 are identical with the primitive elements of @xmath684 as graphs with overlapping divergences necessarily contain subdivergences , and thus do not provide primitive elements per se .",
    "a feynman graph @xmath213 chosen as above has only subgraphs which can be described by proper rooted trees .",
    "thus , its coproduct in @xmath685 will have the general form @xmath691 where the sum is over all subgraphs of @xmath213 , while @xmath692 and @xmath693 are the rooted trees assigned to the corresponding graphs . by the constraints which we imposed on @xmath213 this is always possible .",
    "in @xmath685 we consider the above equation as the definition for the coproduct on elements @xmath694 .      now",
    ", we know that there exists an element @xmath699 such that @xmath700 this element @xmath348 is just the linear combination of rooted trees constructed in the previous section , but ist existences can be established on general grounds from the consideration of maximal forests @xcite .",
    "finally we set @xmath701 and calculate @xmath702 now , if @xmath703 is superficially divergent at all it is a primitive element .",
    "it thus can be described by the rooted tree @xmath277 . to be able to do so we only have to enlarge the algebra @xmath684 to contain the decoration @xmath703 .",
    "an easy recursion argument finally allows to drop the constraint on @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "one concludes that any hopf algebra which contains @xmath684 but also elements @xmath704 is isomorphic to the algebra of rooted trees @xmath684 with an enlarged set of primitive elements . in fig.([f2 ] ) we see some contributions which only generate the tree @xmath277 .",
    "they correspond to such new primitive elements .",
    "a detailed version of this argument will be given elsewhere @xcite ."
