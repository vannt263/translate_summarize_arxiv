    "quantum turbulence(qt ) , which consists of a tangle of quantized vortices , has been investigated since the thermal counterflow experiments of vinen [ 1 - 4 ] half a century ago , while the underlying physics is far from being fully understood [ 5,6 ] .",
    "the numerical simulations are the useful source of knowledge about qt , because the whole dynamics of this system is too complicated to be described analytically .",
    "one of the powerful schemes of the simulation is the vortex filament model based on pioneering works by schwarz [ 7,8 ] .",
    "schwarz performed the numerical simulation of counterflow turbulence under the periodic boundary condition by using the localized induction approximation ( lia ) which neglects a non - local term of the biot - savart integral [ 8 ] .",
    "however he could not obtain the statistically steady state ( sss ) because the vortices lie in planes normal to @xmath5 to prevent them from reconnecting .",
    "therefore the unphysical mixing procedure , in which half of the vortices are randomly selected to be rotated by 90@xmath6 around the axis defined by the flow velocity , was used , and only this method enabled him to obtain the sss .",
    "this failure reminds us that the lia is unsuitable through the absence of the interaction between vortices .",
    "recently , thermal counterflow in superfluid @xmath7he was visualized by using solid hydrogen particles , and the velocity distribution of particles was observed [ 9 ] . in this experiment , two types of particles appeared .",
    "some particles move straight along the normalflow with the approximately same velocity as normalflow .",
    "other particles move zigzag along the direction of superfluid and has different velocity from superfluid . in the latter case , particles seem to be trapped in the core of the vortices .",
    "we try to apply our numerical results for understanding these observations .",
    "section 2 describes the equation of motion of vortices and the method of numerical calculation . in sec.3",
    "we show the typical numerical results of vortex tangle .",
    "section 4 studies the validity of the lia by comparing the lia calculation with the full biot - savart calculation . in the section 5",
    "we present the velocity distribution of vortices in the sss of vortex tangle and compare it with that of particles in the experimental observation .",
    "[ sec:2 ] at 0k the velocity @xmath8 of the filament at the point * s*(@xmath9,t ) is given by @xmath10 where the prime denotes the derivatives with respect to the arc length @xmath9 , and @xmath11 is the quantized circulation , @xmath12 is a cutoff parameter corresponding to a vortex core radius , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the length of the two adjacent line elements that hold the point*s * between .",
    "the first term shows the localized induction field arising from a curved line element acting on itself .",
    "the second term represents the non - local field obtained by carrying out the integral of the biot - savart integral along the rest of the filament .",
    "the third term @xmath15 is an applied field .",
    "the lia used in some works ( e.g.,[7,8,10,11 ] ) means neglecting the second non - local term .",
    "in contrast the calculation without the lia is called the full biot - savart calculation . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the velocity @xmath16 is given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the temperature - dependent friction coefficients , @xmath20 is the normalfluid velocity , and @xmath21 is calculated from eq.(1 ) . in the work [ 8 ]",
    "the author neglected the third term of eq.(2 ) .",
    "we performed the full biot - savart calculation in this work .",
    "the concrete reconnection procedure used in this work is the following .",
    "every vortex is represented by a string of points at intervals of almost @xmath22 .",
    "when a point on a vortex approaches another point on another vortex more closely than the fixed space resolution @xmath23 , we join these two points and reconnect the vortices [ 12 ] . for the integration of the motion of eq.(2 ) in time we used the classical 4th order runnge - kutta method . we usually start with an initial vortex configuration of six vortex rings as shown in fig.1(upper left ) .",
    "in this section we present the numerical simulations of counterflow turbulence at the temperature @xmath24=1.9k , in the computing box 0.1 @xmath25 0.1 @xmath25 0.1 @xmath26 , at applied conterflow velocity @xmath3=0.286 , 0.381 , 0.572 cm / s .",
    "a typical result is shown in fig.1 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ test4 ]    the vortices in our simulations have lower vertical velocities than the superfluid velocity just like the experimental observation . for the quantitative agreement with observation , we need to introduce other effects such as a distortion of vortices by particles .",
    "the obtained numerical results with the full biot - savart law demonstrate that the initially smooth vortex rings develop to a vortex tangle of the statistically steady state .",
    "we compared the numerical results by the full biot - savart calculation to that by the lia calculation .",
    "the lia calculation could not sustain the statistically steady state in contrast to the full biot - savart calculation .",
    "we compared the velocity distributions of vortices obtained by our numerical simulations to the observations by the visualization experiment of couterflow by using solid hydrogen particles .",
    "our results agree with the experimental observation qualitatively in that most vortices have lower velocities than the superfluid velocity ."
