    "the compelling evidence for the presence of dm in the different structures of the universe @xcite has motivated numerous efforts to search for dm by means of astrophysical observations .",
    "if dm is made of wimps annihilating into standard model particles , indirect searches for dm annihilations with vhe @xmath0-rays provide a very promising way to constrain the nature of the dm particle : @xmath0-rays are free of any propagation effects on short distances ( @xmath1 1mpc ) and dm particle annihilation is predicted to give a unique @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "such searches are often conducted using pointed observations toward nearby dm overdensities , because the annihilation rate is proportional to the squared dm density .",
    "popular targets include the galactic center @xcite , satellite galaxies of the milky - way ( mw ) @xcite , globular clusters @xcite and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "+ the dsphs of the local group best meet the criteria for a clear and unambiguous detection of dm .",
    "they are gravitationally bound objects and contain up to @xmath2(@xmath3 ) more mass in dm than in visible matter .",
    "as opposed to the galactic center , they are environments with a favorably low astrophysical @xmath0-ray background .",
    "neither astrophysical @xmath0-ray sources ( supernova remnants , pulsar wind nebulae , etc ) nor gas acting as target material for cosmic rays have been observed in these systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their relative proximity and high galactic latitude make them the best astrophysical targets for high signal - to - noise detection .",
    "+ this paper gives a status of the dsph observational program carried out by the ground - based vhe @xmath0-ray observatory veritas .",
    "section [ sec2 ] presents the instrument and summarizes the veritas dsph observations and data analysis .",
    "section [ sec3 ] interprets the results in terms of constraints on dm models , focusing on models which include a sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "finally , section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "veritas is an array of four 12-meter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) located at the base camp of the f. l. whipple observatory in southern arizona .",
    "each veritas telescope consists of a large optical reflector which focuses the cherenkov light emitted by particle air showers onto a camera of 499 photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the large effective area ( @xmath4 ) , in conjunction with the stereoscopic imaging of air showers , enables veritas to be sensitive over a wide range of energies ( from 100 gev to 30 tev ) with an energy and angular resolution of 15 - 20% and @xmath5 per reconstructed @xmath6-ray , respectively .",
    "veritas is able to detect a point source with 1% of the crab nebula flux at a statistical significance of 5 standard deviations above background ( @xmath7 ) in approximately 25 hours of observations . for further details about veritas ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the absence of signal in any of these observations can be used to derive constraints on various dark matter models .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux from the annihilations of dm particles , of mass @xmath8 , in a spherical dm halo is given by a particle physics term times an astrophysics term : @xmath9 the particle physics term contains all the information about the dm particle : its mass @xmath8 , its total velocity - weighted annihilation cross - section @xmath10 and the differential @xmath0-ray spectrum from all final states weighted by their corresponding branching ratios , @xmath11 .",
    "the astrophysical factor @xmath12 is the square of the dm density integrated along the line of sight ( s ) and over the solid angle @xmath13 : @xmath14)ds.}\\label{fap}\\ ] ] the solid angle is given here by the size of the signal search region defined previously in the analysis , i.e. @xmath15 @xmath1 0.12 deg .",
    "the estimate of the astrophysical factor requires a modeling of the dsph dm distribution .",
    "each dsph dm distribution has been modeled with a navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) profile @xcite , except segue 1 for which the dm distribution has been modeled with an einasto profile @xcite .",
    "the parameters of a dsph profile are constrained using its star kinematics and have each been taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "the resulting astrophysical factors of draco , ursa minor , bootes 1 , willman 1 and segue 1 are presented in table [ tab2 ] , along with their distance and profile modeling .",
    "+ once the astrophysical factors have been estimated , the uls in the number of @xmath6-ray candidates for each dsph can be translated into uls on the total annihilation cross - section : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total observation time and @xmath18 is the effective area as a function of energy , zenith angle and the offset of the source from the pointing position .",
    "+ figure [ fig1 ] shows the veritas 95% cl uls on the velocity - weitghted annihilation cross - section @xmath19 as a function of the dm particle mass for each of the five observed dsph listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the draco , ursa minor , bootes 1 and willman 1 limits have been obtained using a composite dm spectrum with a 90 % @xmath20 branching ratio and a 10% @xmath21 branching ratio @xcite .",
    "the segue 1 limits have been obtained assuming a pure @xmath22 dm annihilation spectrum , which is similar to the composite @xmath20 - @xmath21 spectrum .",
    "the limits are in the range @xmath23 , depending on the considered dsph .",
    "the best limits are obtained for the segue 1 dsph , which has the deepest exposure and one of the highest astrophysical factor among the five dsphs ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the 95% cl upper limit on @xmath24 is at the level of @xmath25 around 1 tev and is among the best reported so far with dsph vhe observations .     as a function of the dm particle mass for the five dsphs observed with veritas .",
    "the limits are computed using a composite dm annihilation spectrum ( 10% @xmath21 + 90% @xmath20 ) , except for the case of segue 1 in which a pure @xmath22 channel was considered .",
    "the grey band area represents a range of generic values for the annihilation cross - section for thermally produced dm.,width=288 ]      in this section , we consider dm models where the annihilation cross - section can be boosted with the sommerfeld enhancement effect .",
    "we use the segue 1 data to constrain such models .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement is a particle physics effect that was suggested to explain the cosmic ray lepton anomalies measured by atic and pamela @xcite .",
    "it arises when the two dm particles interact through an attractive potential , mediated by the exchange of a massive boson @xcite .",
    "the annihilation cross - section enhancement is particularly effective when the dm particle relative velocity is very small .",
    "depending on the mass @xmath26 and the coupling @xmath27 of the exchanged boson , the sommerfeld enhancement can exhibit a series of resonances for specific values of the dm particle mass , giving very large boost factors up to @xmath28 .",
    "in such scenarios , the annihilation cross - section is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the sommerfeld boost factor averaged over the dm particle velocity distribution and depends on the dm particle mass .",
    "@xmath31 is the thermal wimp annihilation cross - section before freeze - out .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement is of particular interest for cold dm halos like dsphs , where the mean star velocity dispersion can reach a few @xmath32 . + we focus here on two models comprising a sommerfeld enhancement to the annihilation cross - section . the first model ( hereafter model i , @xcite ) assumes that the dark matter particle is a wino - like neutralino @xmath33 ( arising in susy extensions of the standard model ) , which annihilates through the exchange of a @xmath34 boson ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , thus leading to a sommerfeld enhancement . the second model ( hereafter model ii )",
    "introduces a new force in the dark sector @xcite , carried by a light scalar field @xmath37 predominantly decaying into leptons and with a mass @xmath38 . in such models , dark matter annihilates to a pair of @xmath37 scalar particles , with an annihilation cross - section boosted by the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the coupling @xmath27 of the light scalar particle @xmath37 to the dark matter particle is determined assuming that @xmath39 is the only channel that regulates the dark matter density before freeze - out @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the veritas constraints on each of these models , derived with the observations of segue 1 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows the constraints on model i. the sommerfeld enhancement exhibits two resonances in the considered dark matter particle mass range , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "veritas excludes these resonances , which boost the annihilation cross - section far beyond the canonical @xmath42 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows the veritas constraints on model ii , for a scalar particle with mass @xmath43 .",
    "two channels in which the scalar particle decays either to @xmath44 or @xmath45 have been considered .",
    "veritas observations start to disfavor such models , especially for the @xmath46 channel where some of the resonances are beyond @xmath42 .",
    "this result holds for @xmath37 particle masses up to a few gev .",
    "since its commissioning phase , the veritas observatory has been actively observing the best dsph targets visible from the northern hemisphere , with data currently taken toward the draco , ursa minor , bootes 1 , willman 1 and segue 1 galaxies .",
    "the non - detection of a vhe @xmath0-ray signal in any of these observations has lead to limits on the velocity - weighted annihilation cross - section @xmath10 of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "the segue 1 data have provided the best limits on @xmath10 reported so far with any dsph observations , though these limits are at least two orders of magnitude away from the canonical @xmath42 .",
    "the segue 1 data have also been used to constrain models with a sommerfeld enhancement , disfavoring them as being a good interpretation of the cosmic ray lepton excesses measured by atic and pamela .",
