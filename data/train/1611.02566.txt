    "<S> we review on a recently proposed quantum exception to the second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that @xmath0he superflows , like any other forms of flows , shall carry entropy or heat in a thermal environment . </S>",
    "<S> following that , one can use a heterogeneous @xmath0he superflow loop to realize entropy - decreasing processes . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention that the heat content of a superflow has an unusual dependence on flow velocity , which is an important factor contributing to the entropy - decreasing processes .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : superflow , entropy , many - body spectra +    the second law of thermodynamics ( slt ) prohibits the decrease of the entropy in an isolated system . </S>",
    "<S> it rules out the desired possibility of utilizing the endless colossal thermal energy in the environment as the major energy source for the civilization . but is this slt truely universal ? </S>",
    "<S> we know that first law of thermodynamics is exact universal , because it is a manifestation of conservation of energy and quantum mechanics obeys the conservation of energy as a built - in law . unlike the first law </S>",
    "<S> , slt does nt corresponds to a built - in rule in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> imagine a situation in which that numberless physical processes obey slt , but there is one quantum process which violates slt , then in this situation we shall accept that slt is not an exact law of nature and that there is an exception to slt . </S>",
    "<S> it is quantum mechanics , rather than slt , which is the true governing law of nature . in @xcite , we show that some @xmath0he - superflow - involving quantum processes contradict slt , and that it is possible to convert the thermal energy in the environment into useful energy . </S>",
    "<S> we shall review this quantum exception to slt .    </S>",
    "<S> the entropy - decreasing quantum processes rely on a fundamental property of @xmath0he superflows . </S>",
    "<S> whether does a @xmath0he superflow carry entropy or thermal energy ? </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological two - fluid model of superfluid @xmath1he gives a no answer . </S>",
    "<S> but this is at odds with quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0he superflow corresponds to a number ( @xmath2 ) of @xmath0he atoms flowing together . if this superflow carries zero entropy and heat , that is equivalently to say that the quantum state of the @xmath2 @xmath0he atoms in the superflow is the lowest energy state at given momentum ( or at given current value ) . </S>",
    "<S> we know that the time evolution of the whole system ( the superflow plus its environment ) is governed by the many - body schrodinger equation . in this time evolution , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum state of the environment is a mixed quantum state , corresponding to a certain temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the subsystem of the @xmath2 @xmath0he atoms ( superflow ) can be expected to be a mixed quantum state too . </S>",
    "<S> it is hard to imagine how this subsystem could reach a zero entropy and zero thermal energy quantum state following the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> even if at a moment this superflow reaches this zero entropy quantum state dramatically , it shall evolve into a mixed state at the following moments . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the superflow shall be a thermal flow in a thermal environment , similar to any conventional flows .     plane . </S>",
    "<S> dots ( in gray and in black ) represent levels . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a dot correspond to the momentum and the energy of the level , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 denotes the height of an energy barrier between two `` valleys '' . </S>",
    "<S> dots in black are the occupied levels of the system ( at low temperature ) , corresponding to a superflow state with a momentum of @xmath4 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> can we understand that a @xmath0he superflow is both thermal and superfluidic ( i.e. , keeping its current from decay ) ? </S>",
    "<S> a recently developed quantum theory of superfluidity @xcite provides an affirmative answer . </S>",
    "<S> this microscopic theory shows that the many - body spectrum of a superfluid has a characteristic feature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider a superfluid composed of @xmath2 particles in a limited geometry , the hamiltonian of this many - body system can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of a particle and @xmath7 represents the inter - particle interaction . </S>",
    "<S> consider the eigenspectrum of the hamiltonian operator , labelled by @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is eigenlevel and @xmath11 is the eigenwavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider also the momentum carried by eigenwavefunction @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total momentum operator along a superflow direction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is not required to be an eigenwavefunction to the operator @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> if one schematically plots the energy levels of this system at the energy - momentum ( @xmath16 ) plane ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sflevels ] ) , one then sees that the low - lying levels form valley - like structures at the boundary region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant quantum states at low temperature corresponds to those levels within the bottoms of the valleys and one can ignore the levels at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> a superflow state ( at low temperature ) corresponds to some occupied levels at a valley at a non - zero momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the system is not allowed to jump from the occupied levels at this valley to left - side valleys with less momenta , due to the energy barriers which separate the valleys . </S>",
    "<S> the prohibition of inter - valley jumps ensures that a superflow keeps its momentum from decay . for a given superflow </S>",
    "<S> , the occupation probability distribution at a relevant valley follows a boltzmann distribution , namely , the occupation probability of a level at the valley is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy of the level , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the temperature of the superflow . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically this thermal distribution is caused by the quanta exchanges between the superflow and its surroundings , which in turn is caused by microscopic interactions between the atoms in the superflows and the particles ( atoms or molecules ) in the surroundings . once realizing that @xmath0he superflows are still thermal flows </S>",
    "<S> , one can expect a phenomenon of @xmath0he superflows similar to the peltier effect of electric currents . </S>",
    "<S> when a @xmath0he superflow passes from a medium to a different medium , it shall experience a temperature change . </S>",
    "<S> the heat content ( specific enthalpy ) of a superflow in the first medium as a function of temperature differs from the heat content function in the second medium . for the conservation of energy , the temperature of the superflow </S>",
    "<S> shall be adjusted so that heat content remains the same ( roughly ) when the superflow exits the first medium ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sfpeltier ] ) . in literature , the temperature change of @xmath0he superflow exiting a medium to a rather large empty space was reported @xcite shortly after the discovery of superfluidity @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    one could note that the flow velocity of the superflow generally changes when it passes from the first medium to the second medium . </S>",
    "<S> if the first medium has a porosity smaller than the second medium , then the flow velocity in the first medium is larger than the flow velocity at the second medium . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the heat content of a superflow in a medium depends on the flow velocity @xcite , which is quite unusual from a classical viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the larger the flow velocity , the smaller the heat content . </S>",
    "<S> such a dependence of a superflow s heat content on the flow velocity could make a large contribution to this `` peltier effect '' of the superflow .    </S>",
    "<S> he superflow changes when exiting a medium to a different medium . ]    in @xcite , we consider a system referred as to a heterogeneous superflow loop ( hsl ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is a circling @xmath21he superflow filling a torus - shaped vessel , where half of the vessel is packed with one kind of medium and the other half is packed with a different medium @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hsloop ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can find an interesting stable temperature configuration along an isolated hsl . </S>",
    "<S> the superflow in one medium has a temperature @xmath22 higher than the temperature of the superflow at the other medium ( denoted by @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> with such a temperature difference , the heat content of superflow in one medium is ( approximately ) the same as the heat content of superflow in the other medium , so that net heat transfer from one medium to the other , caused by the superflow , becomes zero ( approximately ) . to show a dramatical counterexample to slt , consider to prepare two infinitely large heat baths ( besides a hsl ) , with one bath at a temperature @xmath24 and the other at a temperature @xmath25 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> is set to satisfy @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> consider making a good thermal contact between the high temperature part of the hsl and the bath at @xmath24 , and making a good thermal contact between the low temperature part of hsl and the bath at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the superflow absorbs some heat from the heat reservoir at @xmath27 , and this ( moving ) superflow transfers the heat to the high temperature part of the hsl , and eventually the heat is passed to the heat reservoir at @xmath28 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sltce2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a process in which the entropy of the whole system decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy - decreasing process can run for a cosmologically long time , since that the decay of the superflow is prevented by some energy barriers @xcite .        in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we sketch out a prototype of a system for extracting thermal energy from the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this potential energy approach is environmentally friendly to a great extent </S>",
    "<S> . the energy - generating process can be purely physical , without consuming any materials or producing any unwanted materials . </S>",
    "<S> it can be roughly estimated that a system with one kilogram of liquid helium generates ideally a power of several kilowatts or more , but some relevant cryogenic technology needs to be developed for achieving such an efficiency .     to another heat reservoir at a higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ]    to summarize , a quantum exception to slt can be constructed with @xmath0he superflows .    </S>",
