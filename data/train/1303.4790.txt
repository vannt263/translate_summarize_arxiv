    "we can only speculate on the source of the differences . that we find four distinct minima in the @xmath5-space as implied by the symmetry while others do not is encouraging for us .",
    "this could be caused by the use of the mass - squared dominance approximation that , as we have pointed out@xcite , does not converge to the correct answer in precisely the region where there is interference between the two mass - squared difference oscillations .",
    "alternatively , the second minimum for each hierarchy could have accidentally been overlooked .",
    "the preference for the inverse hierarchy comes from the _ lack _ of excess electron neutrinos in the region of the msw matter resonances .",
