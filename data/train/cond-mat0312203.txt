    "[ fig : order_par]d ) becomes unstable much faster than the corresponding metastable state with one or no defects ( figs .",
    "[ fig : order_par]b ) , when the particle moves from the isotropic to the nematic phase .",

    "a detailed comparison of these processes requires , however , further analysis .    to summarize , we studied the interaction of a cylindrical colloidal particle with a ni interface .",
    "we found that , when the particle is close to the interface , the force on the particle is proportional to the penetration depth @xmath117 , and the amplitude of the force scales as @xmath119 . at larger penetrations , discontinuous configurational transitions occur , related to the creation / annihilation of topological defects ."
