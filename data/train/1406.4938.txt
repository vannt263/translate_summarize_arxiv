    "synthetic electromagnetism in ultra cold neutral gases has attracted great interest  @xcite in recent years . in spite of the absence of charge , the use of appropriate laser arrangements has allowed for mimicking the effect of artificial magnetic fields both in the continuum  @xcite and in optical lattices  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the internal level structure of the atoms may be employed to create synthetic spin - orbit coupling  ( soc )  @xcite , an essential ingredient in many condensed - matter phenomena .",
    "the physics of degenerate quantum gases in the presence of soc has attracted a large deal of theoretical attention  ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a particular emphasis has been paid to the case of an equal admixture of rashba and dresselhaus soc , since this is the situation that has been experimentally realized up to now  @xcite .",
    "the physics of bose einstein condensates ( bec ) in the presence of isotropic soc , such as rashba or dresselhaus , is however particularly interesting due to the associated peculiar ring - like dispersion . in the homogeneous case  ( in the absence of a trap ) the mean - field ground state of a two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 bec breaks polar symmetry spontaneously being characterized by the so - called plane - wave or stripe phases , respectively corresponding to one peak or two opposite momentum peaks in the dispersion ring  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a harmonic trap may significantly enrich the ground - state phase diagram , leading to the presence of half quantum vortex phases  @xcite and skyrmion lattice patterns  @xcite .",
    "the effects of soc for the case of becs with higher spin have been also discussed  @xcite . in particular , a spin-@xmath1 bec with soc  ( which could be generated using pulsed magnetic fields  @xcite ) may present triangular and square skyrmion lattice phases  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a simplified picture that allows for an intuitive understanding of the physics behind the various ground - state phases of trapped becs in the presence of rashba ( or dresselhaus ) soc . by exploiting the ring - like form of the dispersion , we derive an effective quasi - one - dimensional model in momentum space . as for the homogeneous case  @xcite the effective quasi-1d model",
    "is characterized by two types of interaction , an effective long - range interaction in momentum space , and a destruction / creation of pairs of atoms with opposite momentum on the rashba ring .",
    "we show , however , that the presence of the trap crucially modifies the form of the interactions , and that this trap - induced modification of the interactions in the effective quasi-1d model explains the numerically observed skyrmion lattice phases of different geometries  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath9 is the two - component spinor wave function .",
    "note that we are hence performing a mean - field analysis , although the ring model discussed below may be used as well beyond the mean - field approximation . the condensate physics is hence given by the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation  ( gpe ) : @xmath10 \\boldsymbol\\psi \\label{eq : gpe2d}\\ ] ]    in the following we assume a dominant soc , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "we also consider that @xmath12 is much greater than the interaction energy per particle .",
    "the latter condition leads in absence of soc to a gaussian bec in the ground - state of the harmonic trap .",
    "the situation is radically different in the presence of soc , where for weak interactions the system presents a series of phases and phase transitions . for spin-1/2 ,",
    "these include two half - vortex phases ( hv(1/2 ) and hv(3/2 ) ) and a skyrmion lattice phase  @xcite  ( for larger interactions the system enters in the so - called stripe or plane - wave phase  @xcite ) . whereas the physics behind the half - vortex phases is quite clear , the energetic justification of the skyrmion lattice phase is on the contrary not well understood .",
    "we develop below a simplified ring model that will allow us for an intuitive understanding of the appearance of the lattice phase .",
    "we now consider the case of @xmath13 .",

    "the radial part , @xmath24 , obeys the 1d hamiltonian @xmath25 , characterized by a harmonic energy spectrum @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath12 is much larger than the interaction energy we may consider that only @xmath27 is populated , and hence @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the oscillator length , and @xmath30 is a normalization constant that we determine below .",
    "the physics of the weakly interacting bose gas in this approximation is characterized entirely by the angular dependent @xmath31 . for a dominant soc we may approximate @xmath32 , and re - write : @xmath33 with @xmath34 the angular momentum around the @xmath35 axis . note that the shift in the angular dispersion of @xmath0 results from the berry s phase of @xmath36 that arises from encircling the rashba ring .",
    "this can not be eliminated by a gauge transformation without inducing twisted boundary conditions in @xmath31 .",

    "we may employ the approximate identity @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the bessel function of first kind . introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath46 , the precious identity requires @xmath47 .",
    "the latter implies that the angular wavefunction @xmath31 must have a sufficiently large angular spread , such that single - particle energy satisfies @xmath48  ( _ thin ring limit _ ) . in what follows",
    ", we assume the thin - ring limit unless otherwise stated .",
    "this assumption is the key assumption in the development of the ring model below . using the previous identity ,",
    "we may easily obtain the form of the spinor in coordinate space  ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50    ( dashed curve ) and @xmath51  ( bold dashed curve ) for a spin-@xmath0 bec with @xmath52 .",

    "we address this issue below .",
    "substituting the expressions for the @xmath71 function in eq .",
    "we obtain a simplified form of the interaction hamiltonian :    @xmath89    the first term in @xmath90 corresponds to type-(i ) interactions , which hence may be understood as an effective `` long - range '' interaction in momentum space .",

    "note that the contribution of type-(i ) interactions to the interaction energy of both hv(1/2 ) and hv(3/2 ) phases is identical .",

    "recall that in the homogeneous case , the interaction energy is clearly minimized by placing the bec in a plane - wave phase  ( single momentum peak ) or two opposite peaks  ( stripe phase )  @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of a local minimum of the interaction energy ( which we stress is induced by the external trapping ) allows , at intermediate interaction values of @xmath60 , the system to minimize the energy by creating a lattice characterized by regular peaks in momentum space separated by an angle @xmath143  @xcite .",
    "this solution has a large interaction energy but a smaller kinetic energy than the plane - wave or stripe solution  ( in the following we denote as `` kinetic energy '' the contribution of the @xmath138 term , which depends on the curvature , @xmath144 , of the angular distribution ) .",
    "moreover , note that a lattice formed by three peaks in momentum space may be approximated by three gaussians placed at a separation of @xmath145 , i.e. very close to the minimum of @xmath94 .    note as well that in the @xmath146-peak case type-(ii ) interactions are obviously irrelevant , since there are no pairs of opposite momenta . in contrast , a @xmath147-peak square configuration given by gaussian - like peaks with an angle separation of @xmath118  ( which would lead to a square lattice phase ) may present in principle type-(ii ) interactions .",

    "[ sec : ringmodelspin1 ] .",
    "the absence of type-(ii ) processes is crucial in spin-@xmath0 becs for the selection of the triangular phase against the square phase .",

    "we may compare the case of six gaussians separated by an angle @xmath149 against the case of three gaussians separated by @xmath145 , assuming in both cases gaussians of the same width .",
    "it is clear that the type-(i ) part of the interaction energy is larger for the hexagonal case .",
    "however , for the @xmath150-peak case the type-(ii ) interactions do not vanish .",
    "the latter is crucial , since the interaction energy of the hexagonal phase may be then reduced by properly setting the phases of the gaussian pairs such that the type-(ii ) contribution is negative  ( the overall interaction energy is of course still repulsive ) . in particular for three pairs of opposite momenta with phases @xmath149 , @xmath96 and @xmath151 , we have numerically checked that the type-(ii ) contribution exactly cancels the increase of type-(i ) interaction energy , and hence that the energy for @xmath150 and for @xmath146 non - overlapping gaussians is the same ( within our numerical accuracy ) .",

    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we compare the angular momentum @xmath152 in the 1d effective model and the 2d exact equation at @xmath52 .",
    "clearly the 1d model recovers both the hv(1/2)-hv(3/2 ) transition and the hv(3/2)-lattice phase transition .",
    "moreover , although the ring model is not applicable for large interactions , the form of the @xmath56 and @xmath94 functions suggests that for sufficiently large @xmath60 the system should experience a first - order phase transition into the stripe  ( or plane - wave ) phase , as observed in the numerical simulations of the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite . note that this occurs when the system jumps from the local interaction minimum to the global one at @xmath121 , since the larger kinetic energy is eventually compensated by the smaller interaction energy for a sufficiently large @xmath60",

    "note that , as mentioned above , the type-(ii ) interactions depend on the phase of the @xmath31 function .",
    "it is hence possible to arrange the angular dependence of the phase such that the type-(ii ) contribution to the interaction energy is minimized .",
    "assuming that the @xmath31 function is formed by four separated narrow gaussian - like wave packets , @xmath184 , at @xmath185 , with @xmath186 , @xmath187 , we obtain that the interaction energy is proportional to @xmath188 , with @xmath189 .",
    "the energy is hence minimized for @xmath190 , for which the contribution of the type-(ii ) interactions is actually negative . a similar analysis for a triangular lattice results in an interaction energy proportional to @xmath191 . since for spin-@xmath1",
    "becs @xmath192 is comparable to @xmath193 and @xmath194 , it is hence clear that the interaction energy of the square lattice may become significantly smaller than that of the triangular lattice .",
    "this mechanism was crucially absent in the spin-@xmath0 case , since @xmath148 , and hence for spin-@xmath0 the triangular lattice was selected . from figs .",
    "[ fig:7 ] an  [ fig:8 ] it is however clear that the kinetic energy , being dependent on @xmath195 , is larger in the square lattice , explaining why there is an intermediate triangular lattice phase .    for @xmath52  ( the case of figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , [ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] ) the direct numerical simulation of the 2d gpe shows a triangular - to - square lattice phase transition at @xmath196 , which is in very good quantitative agreement with the result obtained from the effective 1d ring model  ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "we have also checked in our direct numerical simulation of the 2d gpe that the square lattice is characterized by @xmath190 as discussed above . due to the minimization of the type-(ii ) interactions induced by the relative phase arrangement",
    "the square lattice is very robust , and from our numerical simulation of the 2d gpe we observe that it remains the ground state for @xmath198 , well beyond the validity regime of the thin ring model .",
    "in this paper we have derived an effective quasi - one - dimensional ring model in momentum space for the study of two - dimensional becs under dominant isotropic soc and weak - enough interactions .",
    "the model , which may be generally applied to spinor becs with arbitrary spin and spin - dependent interactions , reduces the bec physics to the angular dependence along the rashba ring .",
    "two main energy contributions characterize this physics , the `` kinetic energy '' induced by the effective dispersion in momentum space introduced by the external trap , and the interaction energy .",
    "the latter is provided by two types of interactions , an effective `` long - range '' interaction between two momentum components in the rashba ring  ( type-(i ) interactions ) , and the destruction / creation of pairs of particles of opposite momentum in the ring  ( type-(ii ) interactions ) .",
    "although these two types of interactions also occur naturally in the absence of trapping  @xcite , we have shown that the presence of the trap introduces a peculiar angular dependence for these interactions , which is responsible for the appearance of skyrmion lattice phases in trapped becs .",
    "we have shown that the ring model permits an intuitive understanding of the ground - state phases of condensates with isotropic soc , well reproducing the qualitative and even quantitative features of the exact 2d model .",
    "the ring model may be applied as well to systems with weakly anisotropic dispersion .",
    "this is in particular the case of realistic soc implementations , that converge to an isotropic ring - like dispersion only at large laser intensities  @xcite . for large but finite intensities ,",
    "the lowest - branch dispersion for a @xmath147 laser arrangement acquires the form @xmath199 where the constant @xmath30 scales inversely with the laser intensity  @xcite .",
    "the extra anisotropic term may be straightforwardly added to the non - interacting hamiltonian , resulting in four energy minima along the rashba ring separated by an angle @xmath118 . at finite intensities and weak interactions",
    "the condensate will occupy these minima .",
    "the form of the interactions derived in this paper , however , will remain valid .",
    "in particular , the fact that @xmath148  ( @xmath200 ) in spin-@xmath0  ( spin-@xmath1 ) becs is expected to play a crucial role in the properties of becs in these four - minima arrangements .    finally , we would like to note that the ring model is interesting well beyond the description of the ground - state mean - field phases of becs .",
    "it may be employed not only for the study of excitations and dynamics ( employing , respectively , the effective quasi - one - dimensional bogoliubov - de gennes equations and the time - dependent gpe associated to eq .  ) , but also for the study of beyond - mean - field physics , since the derivation of the ring model and the effective interactions does not rely on mean - field approximations : one could use eq .
