    "quantum technology protocols exploit the unique properties of quantum systems to achieve communication , computing and metrology tasks that are impossible , inefficient or intractable for classical systems @xcite . in many cases the distribution of entanglement ,",
    "correlations between subsystems that exceed those possible for classical systems , is a necessary condition for quantum technology protocols to succeed .",
    "however , entanglement is fragile and can easily be degraded by the communication or storage of the entangled quantum systems .",
    "one solution to this problem is entanglement distillation @xcite . given an ensemble of weakly entangled quantum states , distillation techniques allow one to select or distill a smaller sub - ensemble of quantum states that are more strongly entangled .",
    "this can be achieved using only local operations and classical communication . in this way",
    "strong entanglement can be established between remote locations under conditions where it would be impossible without distillation  such as losses that are common in quantum communication channels .",
    "there are two broad classes of quantum optical technology protocols : those using quantum observables with a discrete spectrum , such as the spin of an electron , and those using quantum variables with a continuous spectrum , such as the position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "our focus here is distillation of continuous - variable ( cv ) states .",
    "the primary entangled resource in cv systems is the two - mode squeezed vacuum state , also known as the einstein - podolsky - rosen state @xcite because its idealized version was introduced by epr in the early days of quantum mechanics to illustrate quantum nonlocality .",
    "the epr state can be used to implement many quantum protocols including continuous versions of teleportation and quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the cv approach to quantum communication is its universality : it is capable of transmitting arbitrary states of light , in contrast to the single - photon subspace of the hilbert space to which the discrete method is limited .",
    "further , homodyne detection used in cv systems does not require expensive single - photon detectors and is more tolerant to ambient light .",
    "additionally , in contrast to their discrete - variable counterparts , high - quality epr states are readily available on demand at a high rate from parametric amplifiers .    on the other hand , those communication protocols that use single photons do not need a special distillation procedure to counter the effect of the losses .",
    "this is because if a photon is lost , it is not registered by the detector , so a loss event is automatically eliminated from further analysis . in cv protocols , quadrature detection occurs independently of the losses , so recovering an entangled resource suitable for use in a teleportation or repeater protocol requires a dedicated distillation step .    in this paper we present experimental results demonstrating the distillation of optical cv entanglement in two settings : for very low initial squeezing and after transmission through a lossy channel . in the second",
    "setting , we directly observe an entanglement strength of our distilled state that exceeds anything possible via deterministic transmission of the states through the same channel .",
    "that is , even if a perfectly pure , infinitely entangled epr state was passed through that channel , the resulting entanglement would be inferior to what we observe for our distilled state .",
    "we will refer to this as breaking the deterministic bound .",
    "our protocol relies on the technique of noiseless linear amplification ( nla ) @xcite , in contrast to previous cv entanglement distillation demonstrations based on photon subtraction @xcite .",
    "photon subtraction is unable to enhance entanglement in the epr state by more than a factor of two , which is by far not sufficient to compensate for a loss occurring in a typical communication line .",
    "nla does not suffer from this limitation , and in principle allows restoring the entanglement to a macroscopic level after an arbitrarily high loss @xcite .",
    "it is this feature of nla that enables us to break the deterministic bound .",
    "it represents a major step forward in realizing protocols that can enhance quantum technologies under practical conditions .",
    "a key feature of our experiment is that heralded , free propagating distilled epr states are produced by our protocol .",
    "this is in contrast to experiment @xcite , where nla has been emulated by postselecting the quadrature measurements of an asymmetrically attenuated epr state .",
    "this virtual distillation protocol can not herald free - propagating epr pairs and hence can not be used for quantum teleportation or repeaters .",
    "the principal scheme of our setup is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "we explain the idea of our method in the practically relevant case of low initial squeezing and high losses .",
    "the initial epr state prepared in a pair of modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is then given by @xmath2 where we have limited the analysis to the first order of the squeezing amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "a loss channel with amplitude transmissivity @xmath4 applied to mode @xmath1 will degrade the non - vacuum component of this state , transforming it into a mixture @xmath5    we then subject this state to nla .",
    "in contrast to previous nla experiments @xcite , where either the method of generalized quantum scissors @xcite or coherent superposition of photon subtraction and addition was used , here we employ a technique known as quantum catalysis @xcite . the mode to be amplified is reflected from a low - reflectivity beam splitter , on which it is brought into interference with an ancillary single photon .",
    "the amplification event is heralded by detecting a single photon in the other output port of that beam splitter ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , inset ) .",
    "this will happen if either ( a ) the ancilla photon is reflected ( probability amplitude of this event equals the amplitude reflectivity @xmath6 of the beam splitter ) or ( b ) a photon from the epr state is transmitted ( this occurs with probability amplitude @xmath7 ) . in the latter case , the ancilla photon is likely to transmit through the beam splitter into the reflected channel of the epr state .",
    "if these possibilities are made indistinguishable by proper mode matching of the ancilla photon and the epr state , their amplitudes add coherently . as a result",
    ", the epr state is transformed into @xmath8 the second term in the above state is of the higher order in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 than the second term , so the final state is well approximated by pure superposition @xmath12 we see that the reduction of the single - photon component due to low initial squeezing and/or loss in the communication is compensated by the reduction of the vacuum part due to the catalysis .",
    "this is equivalent to nla with an amplitude gain of @xmath13 .",
    "the amount of entanglement to be recovered depends on the ratio @xmath14 and reaches one ebit at @xmath15 .",
    "if we instead aim to optimize the two - mode squeezing of the resulting state , this goal is reached at a slightly lower gain of @xmath16^{-1}$ ] resulting in a two - mode squeezing factor of @xmath17 with respect to the standard quantum limit .",
    "the precise value of the optimal gain may vary dependent on the efficiency of the ancilla photon source as well as the chosen continuous - variable entanglement measure .",
    "the bottom line is , though , that however high the loss , and however low the initial squeezing may be , one can choose the nla gain to recover a macroscopic amount of entanglement in the distilled state @xcite .",
    "the epr state ( fig .  [ f1 ] ) is prepared in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal ( ppktp@xmath18 ) , where the type ii parametric down - conversion is taking place .",
    "the crystal is pumped with frequency - doubled pulses at @xmath19 nm , generated by a ti : sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 76 mhz and a pulse width of @xmath20 ps .",
    "we spatially split the outgoing orthogonally - polarized light modes on a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "each mode is subjected to balanced homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "the phase of one of the local oscillator phases is varied by a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) .",
    "this allows us to obtain a quorum of the two - mode quadrature measurements and therefore completely characterize the state .",
    "we observe the variances in the difference and sum of the position quadratures of the initial state to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 , measured in units of the vacuum state level [ fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) ] .",
    "this corresponds to the squeezing parameter of @xmath23 .",
    "prior to distillation , we degrade the initial state s entanglement by two alternative methods .",
    "first , we turn the polarization of the pump beam by @xmath24 , resulting in the reduction of the squeezing parameter @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "this reduces the epr correlations , bringing the difference and sum quadrature noise levels to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the second method consists of introducing asymmetric attenuation imitating propagation of mode 2 through a lossy optical channel with an intensity transmissivity of @xmath28 .",
    "then the difference and sum quadrature noise levels become @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . such low squeezing levels",
    "could not be reliably measured by homodyne detection , so the variance values quoted above are based on the measured initial squeezing and the known attenuation factor .",
    "the single photon state required for the nla is obtained from parametric down - conversion in another crystal , ppktp@xmath31 , at a rate of 50100khz , heralded by the clicks of a single - photon counting module ( spcm@xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "the variable beam splitter that enacts the nla is implemented by a combination of two polarizing beam splitters and a half - wave plate between them .",
    "one output of that beam splitter is directed onto another photon detector ( spcm@xmath31 ) while the other one is subjected to homodyne detection .",
    "the distillation events correspond to both spcms firing synchronously , and occur at a rate of @xmath32 .    to characterize the distilled state ,",
    "the quadrature data from both detectors should be accompanied by knowledge of the sum @xmath33 of the local oscillator phases for each data sample @xcite .",
    "we acquire this information by utilizing the fraction of mode @xmath1 of the original epr state that is reflected from the nla beam splitter towards the homodyne detector in the absence of the heralding event .",
    "this field exhibits phase - dependent quadrature correlations with mode @xmath0 .",
    "because it is supplied at the master laser repetition rate , we observe a sufficiently clear correlation signal to retrieve @xmath33 at any moment in time .",
    "it is the availability of this phase evaluation technique that has motivated us to choose the catalysis scheme in favor of the more common scissors scheme for the nla .    to mitigate the degradation of this reference signal by the loss channel",
    ", we implement that channel using an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) followed by a half - wave plate .",
    "the eom is controlled by a square wave of a 0.2 s period ( during which the phase is assumed to vary linearly ) and a duty cycle of 0.35 .",
    "the  off \" period , when the transmission through the eom is maximized , is used to measure @xmath34 . during the  on \" period ,",
    "the eom voltage is set to attenuate the propagating signal , and the quadrature samples associated with the distilled epr state are acquired .",
    "our experimental results are summarized in fig .  [ f2 ] . part",
    "( a ) shows samples of the raw data for the original and distilled states while the left and right columns in ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to the distilled states after applying the two methods of degrading the entanglement .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the variances of the sum and difference of the position quadratures ( the behavior of the momentum quadrature is similar to that of the position ) .",
    "the amount of recovered squeezing is maximized at @xmath3567 for the first method and @xmath351012 for the second , which is consistent with the theoretical expectation in the ideal case @xmath16^{-1}$ ] . in both cases ,",
    "the two - mode squeezing of the state recovered by distillation is at the same level as the initial state , and dramatically higher than that of the epr state with reduced squeezing , or the attenuated epr state before distillation .",
    "to quantitatively estimate the degree of entanglement at different stages of our experiment , we use the duan _",
    "inseparability parameter @xcite , defined as @xmath36 for all our data sets , we found the optimal value of @xmath37 to be close to unity , resulting in the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](c ) .",
    "the value of this parameter in the distilled state is a factor of about five greater than that in the degraded epr states . to our knowledge , this factor of entanglement increase achieved in a distillation protocol is higher than anything reported to date , not only in the continuous- , but also in the discrete - variable domain @xcite .    for distillation",
    "after asymmetric loss , we can also compare this parameter with that of the perfect epr state that has experienced the same loss , in which case @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the entanglement observed in the distilled state is consistently stronger than this benchmark , demonstrating that our method is able to overcome the deterministic bound .",
    "it is instructive to estimate our distillation procedure by finding a hypothetical  equivalent \" epr state that , after appropriate attenuation of both channels , would exhibit the same quadrature statistics as our distilled state @xcite .",
    "we found the squeezing parameter of that state and the equivalent efficiency of the loss channel in mode @xmath1 to be , respectively , about two and three times greater than those in the actual experiment .",
    "this illustrates the capability of our procedure to largely compensate for the losses and low initial squeezing @xcite .",
    "the cv entanglement distillation procedure demonstrated here allows us to compensate for the low initial squeezing and losses in the transmission channel , however significant these detrimental factors may be .",
    "for the first time , we have broken the deterministic bound for the distribution of cv entanglement .",
    "these properties make our method promising for the construction of a cv quantum error correction protocol @xcite and hence ultimately a cv quantum repeater .",
    "however , our results also demonstrate the limitations in the amount of entanglement that can be recovered .",
    "there are two reasons giving rise to these limitations .",
    "first , the single - channel linear - optical scheme implemented here constitutes a good approximation to nla only for output states with mean photon numbers much less than one , thereby imposing a fundamental limit on the amount of squeezing and entanglement attainable through the distillation .",
    "second , we are not approaching even that limit because of imperfect preparation of the epr and the ancilla photon , mode matching on the nla beam splitter and detection inefficiencies .",
    "the first of the above issues can be resolved by switching to multichannel nla as envisioned in the original proposal @xcite . addressing the second point",
    " improving the experimental efficiencies  is possible by a number of techniques . in particular , switching from the pulsed to continuous - wave domain would allow eliminating the intrinsic efficiency issues associated with pulsed squeezing @xcite and enable significant preparation and detection efficiency improvements @xcite .",
    "however , before these measures are to be undertaken , it is important to theoretically understand the requirements for a distillation device that would enable construction of a practical continuous - variable quantum repeater  as was done for the discrete - variable case @xcite .",
    "this understanding will clarify if and how the method presented here must be improved in order to qualify for practical applications .",
