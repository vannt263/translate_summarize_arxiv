    "the zeldovich approximation ( za ) ( @xcite ) describes structure formation in the form of a deceptively simple equation @xmath2 rather than describing just ballistic motion , this equation hides a formalism of lagrangian collision - free fluid mechanics . in the context of emerging interest in phase - space folding descriptions of structure formation ( @xcite ) , it becomes all the more relevant to understand this expression at a much deeper level .",
    "we can see why there is more to the za than inertial motion , if we compute particle densities from the above expression .",
    "density increases or decreases locally as a fluid element contracts or expands . taking a fluid element from lagrangian location @xmath3",
    ", we can quantify its deformation in terms of the deformation tensor @xmath4 .",
    "this tensor is best studied locally in the eigenvector frame of reference @xmath5 , where @xmath6 becomes diagonal .",
    "the density is then @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the set of lagrangian locations solving for @xmath9 in equation [ eq : zeld ] , and @xmath10 are the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor @xmath6 .",
    "note that this expression for the density has singularities whenever for one of the eigenvalues we have @xmath11        this notion gives us the traditional interpretation of za , namely one where gravitational collapse occurs in three possible stages .",
    "first objects form along the major axis of collapse , making pancakes ; then along the second eigenvector filaments form ; and finally if and when all three eigenvalues have passed a singularity , a cluster forms .",
    "this corresponds to the _ morse theory _ view of nodes and saddles exploited in many structure finders .",
    "we show that , even in the narrow confines of the za , this interpretation is not complete ; even that it is wrong on the account of the formation of the first filaments ( @xcite ) . taking the mathematics of morse theory a step further , we arrive at lagrangian _ singularity theory _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "this theory shows how to predict the evolution of _ folds _ , _ cusps _ , _ swallow - tails _",
    ", _ butterflies _ and _ umbilics _ directly from the initial velocity potential @xmath12 .",

    "is the projected view , with the fold and cusp locations marked . between the folds we find a three - stream region . ]",
    "a _ fold _ is the simplest kind of singularity we have .",
    "it is the caustic that separates single - stream from multi - stream regions and is also found under the cryptic name @xmath13 .",
    "refers to the ade classification of singularities introduced by arnold . in this paper",
    "we also deal with @xmath0 for cusp , @xmath14 for swallow - tail , and @xmath15 for umbilic singularities .",
    "] at any moment in time , pancakes can be identified as the locations of @xmath13 folds . at a fold the phase - space sheet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cusp ] ) is tangent to line of projection . in the case of za ,",
    "this happens when @xmath16 , identifying the level - sets of @xmath17 as the lagrangian progenitors of folds .",
    "two folds may connect at a _",
    "cusp_. a fold being a line of tangency on the phase - space sheet , there exists points where the fold line itself is tangent to the projection , these points are the cusps ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cusp ] ) . in the tensor field @xmath6",
    ", a cusp is found where a level - set of @xmath17 is tangent to the corresponding eigenvector @xmath18 , or @xmath19 finding all @xmath0-points for each level - set of @xmath17 traces an @xmath0-line .",
    "the set of @xmath0-lines trace the entire network of filaments formed in the za , throughout time .",
    "it can be shown that all maxima and saddle points of the function @xmath20 also lie on an @xmath0-line . lowering a level - plane down on the function @xmath20",
    ", we can see that at the maxima of @xmath17 ( @xmath21-points ) two cusps are created , while at the saddle points ( @xmath22-points ) they annihilate , merging two pancakes .",

    "it shows the pancake at its prime , highly elongated with a cusp on each end . ]",
    "-lines in red , and triangles showing @xmath15 points . on the right : the density contrast resulting from a 2d pm code , with the eulerian displaced @xmath0-lines over - plotted . ]",
    "a pancake may branch by creating two new cusps at a fold .",
    "typically one of these cusps remains within the confines of the present pancake and the other dashes out to create a subsidiary pancake , often to merge later with another pancake at an @xmath22-point , creating a three - legged structure .",
    "the point at which a pancake branches is called a swallow - tail , denoted @xmath14 .",
    "an @xmath14 singularity is found in lagrangian space at points where an @xmath0-line is tangent to the corresponding eigenvector , or equivalently at local maxima of @xmath17 limited to the @xmath0-line .",
    "important to note here , is that we do nt need to involve the second eigenvalue to create a node in the network of caustics . moving this discussion to the three - dimensional case",
    ", we do nt strictly need to collapse along the second eigenvector to create a filament - like structure .",
    "this also suggests the existence of different possible late - time morphologies for filaments .",
    "+ we computed the @xmath0-lines for a set of initial conditions and compared the result with those of a 2d n - body code .",
    "a non - linear time evolution may be approximated by truncating power of the initial conditions at scales smaller than the scale of non - linearity .",
    "it is well known that observable filaments have a density contrast around unity , so this method should give realistic results .",
    "we find good agreement for all relevant @xmath24 power - spectra , in an eye - ball comparison of filaments predicted by za with density fields from a 2d pm code .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody ] .",
    "we showed how the emergence of caustics in the za allows us to trace the formation of cosmic structures in a formal , yet physically meaningful way .",
    "however , the za suffers from a major flaw in that it does nt allow for gravitational interaction , and therefore hierarchical structure formation .",
    "this is because the za is solely based on local analysis of the velocity potential and its chain of derivatives .",
    "the adhesion model moves beyond local considerations , which makes it computationally more intensive than the za ( though still much faster than n - body ) .",
    "still , results are computed from initial conditions directly and with complete accountability .",
    "the adhesion model is arrived at by taking the source - free ( hence collision - free ) euler equation , and adding an artificial viscosity term to _ emulate _ the effects of gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting equation @xmath25 is known as burgers equation ; in the limit where @xmath26 , it has the exact solution @xmath27 the _ global maximum _ in this solution can be computed efficiently using either a legendre transform , convex hull ( @xcite ) or a weighted voronoi diagram ( @xcite ) .",
    "one condition for reaching an extremum is that the first derivative of the maximised quantity should vanish .",
    "performing this test reduces above equation to the za as presented in equation [ eq : zeld ] .",
    "the global maximisation guarantees that the resulting map from lagrangian to eulerian space stays _ monotonic _ always . where and whenever shell - crossing occurs in the za , adhesion creates a solid structure .",
    "matter inside these structures is confined to stay inside , which is the reason people may refer to the adhesion model as having `` sticky particles '' . outside collapsed structures the results from the za and adhesion are identical ; caustics from za are compressed to infinitesimally thin structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adhesion ] ) .",
    "this unifies zeldovich idea of collapsed structures in terms of shell crossing with a hierarchical formation model .",
    "+    the solution to burgers equation given in expression [ eq : burgsol ] is identical to the definition of the _ weighted voronoi tessellation _",
    ", weighted by the potential . the voronoi cell of a lagrangian point @xmath28 occupies an area in eulerian space @xmath29 given by @xmath30 taking @xmath31 as the weights in this expression reduces it to the given solution in equation [ eq : burgsol ] . where there is a voronoi tessellation , there is its dual : the _ delaunay triangulation_. it is the latter that gives us the origin and mass of matter residing in the nodes , edges and faces of the voronoi tessellation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dual ] ) .",
    "one application of the adhesion model is the detection of walls , filaments and nodes in cases where some form of an initial potential is available .",
    "we ran our adhesion code on a set of 25 constrained initial conditions _ reconstructed _",
    "( @xcite ) to produce structures in our local universe ( @xmath32 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this reconstruction is based on the 2mass redshift catalog ( @xcite ) , which covers the full sky except for galactic lattitudes @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : localvoids ] provides a remarkably detailed reconstruction of the cosmic web in the 2mrs volume .",
    "it shows the ( surface ) density of the weblike structures in the local universe .",
    "these are the result of adhesion simulations by @xcite and @xcite , based on the the constrained bayesian kigen reconstruction by @xcite of the initial conditions in the local volume traced by the 2mrs redshift survey . for a given gaussian primordial field , the adhesion formalism allows the accurate reconstruction of the rich pattern of weblike features that emerge in the same region as a result of gravitational evolution .",
    "the adhesion formalism was applied to 25 constrained realizations of the 2mrs based primordial density field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean of these realizations gives a reasonably accurate representation of the significant filamentary and wall - like features in the local universe .",
    "most outstanding is the clear outline of the void population in the local universe .",
    "the reconstruction also includes the velocity flow in the same cosmic region .",
    "it reveals the prominent nature of the outflow from the underdense voids , clearly forming a key aspect of the dynamics of the megaparsec scale universe .",
    "the local universe structure in figure  [ fig : localvoids ] presents a telling image of a void dominated large scale universe .",
    "many of the voids in the adhesion reconstruction can be identified with the void nomenclature proposed by fairall ( @xcite ) , who mainly identified these voids by eye from the 6dfgrs survey .",
    "it is interesting to see that the socalled tully void appears to be a richly structured underdense region , containing at least the microscopium void , the local void and the `` trans tully void '' .    in the same reconstruction",
    ", we are studying the intricate filamentary network in and around the pisces - perseus supercluster . the image in figure[fig : perseus ]",
    "provides a nice impresssion of the complex 3-dimensional structure and connectivity along the main ridge of the pisces - perseus supercluster .",
    "it also shows how the main ridge connects to several neighbouring filaments , connecting near massive clusters along the ridge , and how these filaments surround a lower density planar structure .",
    "interesting is to note the clustering and alignment of the small ( whitish ) filamentary tendrils in and around the main arteries of the cosmic web .",
    "analysis of this weblike structures region is under progress and will be first reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
