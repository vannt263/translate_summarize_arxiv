    "the electronic properties of strongly correlated transition - metal oxides strongly depend on spin and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite both spins and orbitals on neighboring sites interact with each other via superexchange interactions,@xcite giving rise to a complex interplay and potentially to novel states induced by orbital quantum fluctuations . in this context",
    "the occurrence of orbital order and more exotic states , like an orbital peierls state@xcite and an orbital - liquid ground state have been discussed.@xcite one possibility to test materials for those orbital states is to investigate the character of the elementary orbital excitations .",
    "if the superexchange interaction dominates , one expects novel collective elementary excitations , namely orbital waves or orbitons with a significant dispersion,@xcite analogous to spin waves in a magnetically ordered state .",
    "however , the orbitals are also strongly coupled to the lattice,@xcite therefore orbital excitations in many compounds are well described in the limit of local crystal - field excitations .",
    "if both , superexchange interactions and the coupling to the lattice are relevant , the spectral signatures become more difficult to interpret , a complex situation that has hardly been studied thus far.@xcite    the experimental observation of orbitons at low energies @xmath5250mev has been claimed based on raman data of lamno@xmath0 , @xmath6tio@xmath0 , and @xmath6vo@xmath0 with @xmath6=rare earth.@xcite however , the orbiton interpretation of these data has caused controversy.@xcite for manganites with partially occupied @xmath3 states in a predominantly octahedral crystal field , it is meanwhile well established that the orbital degree of freedom is quenched by the strong crystal - field splitting of the order of 1ev.@xcite recently , it has been shown by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) on 1d cuprate chains that such high - energy orbital excitations may show a significant dispersion.@xcite the large dispersion reflects the strong superexchange coupling of the cuprates , and the high excitation energy results from the crystal - field splitting . at the same time , the high excitation energy of the lowest orbital excitation is a clear signature that orbital fluctuations are weak in the ground state , and that this orbitally ordered ground state is not affected by the high - energy dispersion .",
    "in contrast , the crystal - field splitting is much weaker for the partially occupied @xmath2 states in titanates and vanadates . for @xmath6vo@xmath0 with @xmath7 electron configuration",
    ", it has been suggested that orbital quantum fluctuations may be comparatively strong because superexchange interactions between @xmath2 electrons are frustrated on a cubic or nearly cubic lattice.@xcite from magnetic neutron scattering , indications for highly unusual orbital correlations were found and the existence of an orbital peierls state in the intermediate phase of yvo@xmath0 has been proposed.@xcite however , a recent study of the optical excitations across the mott - hubbard gap rules out that orbital fluctuations are strong in @xmath6vo@xmath0.@xcite some of us reported the observation of orbital excitations in the optical conductivity of yvo@xmath0.@xcite an optical absorption band at 0.4ev for polarization of the electric field @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 has been attributed to the exchange of orbitals on adjacent sites , i.e. , to the direct excitation of two orbitons . a two - orbiton interpretation has also been discussed for the rixs data of the orbital excitations of the @xmath11 compounds latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0.@xcite in the titanates , the two - orbiton character is difficult to prove since the orbital excitations are observed at the same energy of 0.20 - 0.25ev in rixs , raman spectroscopy , and infrared absorption,@xcite while there is no clear signature of a one - orbiton excitation at about half the energy of the proposed two - orbiton peak . it has been claimed that the rixs intensity of two - orbiton excitations may exceed that of single - orbiton modes in titanates , in particular if quantum fluctuations are large in the orbital sector.@xcite    rixs is the analogue of raman spectroscopy with x - ray photons .",
    "rixs is very sensitive to orbital excitations , in particular in the soft x - ray range.@xcite at the v @xmath12 edge , a photon is resonantly absorbed , exciting a @xmath13 core electron to an empty @xmath14 state , and subsequently this intermediate state decays by re - emitting a photon , leaving the system in , e.g. , an orbitally excited state .",
    "one major advantage of rixs over raman scattering with visible light is the short wavelength of x - rays , allowing to study the excitations as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , by tuning the energy of the incoming light to a particular absorption band , special ions are selected and potentially also specific crystallographic sites . since the probing depth for soft x - rays is comparatively large ,",

    "these values also agree with various theoretical results predicting the intra-@xmath2 transitions in the range of 0.06 - 0.24ev.@xcite based on raman scattering data , the observation of orbitons has been claimed in @xmath6vo@xmath0 at lower excitation energies of 43mev and 62mev ( refs .  ) and at 45mev and 84mev.@xcite however , a more recent study@xcite suggests that these peaks have to be interpreted as multiphonons , in agreement with our results .",

    "does not show an orbital moment , thus the spin - orbit mechanism is switched off and the spin - selection rule applies .",
    "also in optics , the spin - flip excitations are suppressed by the spin selection rule , but they become weakly allowed by spin - orbit coupling or by the simultaneous excitation of a magnon.@xcite therefore , it is not necessary to consider a phonon shift for the comparison of optics and rixs in the case of spin - flip excitations .",
    "the rixs peak observed at 1.84ev at 300k ( see fig .",

    "the overall line width of about 0.2ev of the features at 0.1 - 0.2ev is certainly larger than the experimental resolution of 60mev .",
    "we identify two main reasons for the large line width : ( i ) a multi - peak structure , i.e.  the experimental feature is composed of more than one peak , and ( ii ) the coupling to phonons or magnons , giving rise to incoherent parts of the orbital spectra .    in a crystal - field scenario ,",

    "the spectrum is composed of a series of phonon sidebands . in a solid , these sidebands",
    "are typically not resolved but form a broad excitation continuum.@xcite concerning point ( i ) , a multi - peak structure arises both from the splitting of the orbitally threefold degenerate @xmath69 state in a non - cubic environment and from the existence of two different v sites within the unit cell in the intermediate phase at 100k . in total , this yields four different excitation energies in a crystal - field scenario .",
    "however , results based on lda@xcite ( local density approximation ) and first principles@xcite indicate that the crystal - field splitting is similar for the two v sites and that the excitation spectrum can be grouped into two bands ( at 0.06 - 0.08ev and 0.20 - 0.24ev according to ref .",

    "this can be rationalized by assuming that the rixs feature consists of two different peaks with spectral weights that depend on @xmath31 , similar to the overall behavior depicted in fig .",
    "a strong dependence of the relative spectral weight of orbital excitations was observed also in rixs on tiocl.@xcite we emphasize that it is possible to describe our rixs data by two orbital excitations at 0.10 - 0.13ev and 0.20 - 0.22ev with gaussian line shapes under the assumption that the spectral weights of these two excitations depend on @xmath31 , temperature , and momentum ( see fig .
