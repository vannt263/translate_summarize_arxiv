    "we also described the library - like nature of the google books corpus which reflects word usage by authors with each book , in principle , represented once .",
    "word frequency is thus a deceptive aspect of the corpus as it is not reflective of how often these words are read , as might be informed by book sales and library borrowing data , much less spoken by the general public .",

    "@xcite , we observed this asymmetry in the contributions to the jensen - shannon divergence ( defined below ) between decades , with most large contributions being accounted for by words whose relative frequencies had increased over time . in this paper , we apply a similar information - theoretic approach to examine this effect for words moving across fixed usage frequency thresholds .",

    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "in  @xcite , petersen _ et al._examined the birth and death rates of words over time for various data sets in the first version of the google books corpus .",
    "they defined the birth year and death year of an individual word as the first and last year , respectively , that the given word appeared above one twentieth its median relative frequency .",
    "excluded from considerations were words appearing in only one year and words appearing for the first time before 1700 .",
    "the rates of word birth and death , respectively , were found by normalizing the numbers of births and deaths by the total number of unique words in a given year .",
    "results typical to all data sets included decreased birth rates and increased death rates over time .",
    "these results are not implausible , and the results were noted to be qualitatively similar when one tenth the median frequency is used as a threshold .",
    "but the very specific nature of the analysis  particularly the multiple temporal restrictions on the words included in the analysis , the reliance on a particular proportion of each word s median frequency , and the ignoring of all but the first and last crossings over this threshold  raise questions as to the robustness of the method .",
    "now , the common - sense interpretation of `` word death '' is clearly that a word falls out of usage ( relatively ) at a fixed point in history . ignoring all but the first and last crossings of a threshold tied to both a word s usage frequency and a specific time range appears to cause problems in this regard in  @xcite , and we find a boundary effect for death rates induced by the choice of the time range s end point . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we recreate the described analysis for the second version of english fiction .",
    "we note that in our analyses , the relative frequencies are coarse - grained at the level of decades ( see methods below ) .",
    "we excluded words appearing in only one decade ( rather than year ) and words appearing before the 1820s ( instead of 1700 ) .",
    "again , this more recent initial cut - off date accounts for the high frequency of ocr errors observed before 1820 .",
    "these differences with  @xcite are not substantive , and allow us to re - examine their work and build out our own in meaningful ways .",
    "we compare the birth and death rates as observed recently versus historically by performing the analysis with three different endpoints imposed : the 1950s , the 1970s , and the 1990s .",
    "we present the results of the recreation in fig .",
    "[ petersen ] ( c.f .",
    "fig .  2 in  @xcite ) .",
    "using the 1990s cutoff , the observed birth rates are qualitatively similar to those found for various data sets ( from the 2009 version of the corpus ) in  @xcite and display spikes in the 1890s and 1920s ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ petersen ] , light gray ) .",
    "we see that birth rates are not affected by moving the `` end of history '' back to the 1950s or 1970s .",
    "the observed death rates with the 1990s boundary ( bottom panel in fig .  [ petersen ] , light gray ) are also similar to that found in  @xcite , despite the lack of deaths detected during much of the 19th century .",
    "( recall , we ignored words originating prior to 1820 . )    however , as the terminal boundary is moved back to the 1970s , what was originally a stable region between the 1910s and 1940s turns into a apparent region of gradually increasing word extinction .",
    "( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ petersen ] , gray ) . as the boundary is moved further back to the 1950s , the increase in death rate",
    "is no longer gradual ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ petersen ] , dark gray ) .",
    "we thus see a clear dependence of the observations of the death rate on when the history of the corpus ends . moving the `` start of history '' forward in time",
    "similarly affects birth rates .",
    "thus , while the method in  @xcite provides a reasonable approach to analyzing dynamics and asymmetries in the evolutionary dynamics of a language data set , the results for birth and death rates in  [ petersen ] depend on when the experiment is performed .",
    "so motivated , we proceed to develop an approach that is robust with respect to time boundaries .",
    "we coarse - grain the relative frequencies in the second english fiction data set at the level of decades  e.g . , between 1820-to-1829 and 1990-to-1999by averaging the relative frequency of each unique word in a given decade over all years in that decade .",
    "( we weight each year equally . )",
    "this allows us to conveniently calculate and sort contributions to the jensen - shannon divergence ( defined below ) of individual 1-grams between any two time periods      as in our previous paper  @xcite , we examined the dynamics of the 2012 version of english fiction by calculating contributions to the jensen - shannon divergence ( jsd )  @xcite between the distributions of 1-grams in two given decades .",
    "we then used these contributions to resolve specific and important signals in dynamics of the language .",
    "( this material , which is presented in greater detail in our previous work , is outlined in sufficient detail below . )",
    "given a language with 1-gram distributions @xmath0 in the first decade and @xmath1 in second , the jsd between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a mixed distribution of the two years , and @xmath4 is the shannon entropy  @xcite of the original distribution .",
    "the jsd is symmetric and bounded between 0 and 1 bit .",
    "these bounds are only observed when the distributions are identical and free of overlap , respectively .    the contribution from the @xmath5 word to the divergence between two decades , as derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : jsd ] , is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , so that contribution from an individual word is proportional to both the average frequency of the word and also depends on the ratio between the smaller and average frequencies . to elucidate the second dependency , we reframe the contribution as @xmath8 words with larger average frequencies yield larger contribution signals as do those with smaller ratios , @xmath9 , between the frequencies .",
    "a common 1-gram changing subtly can produce a large signal .",
    "so can an uncommon or new word given a sufficient shift from one decade to the next .",
    "@xmath10 , the proportion of the average frequency contributed to the signal , is concave ( up ) and symmetric about @xmath11 , where the frequency remains unchanged yielding no contribution .",
    "if a word appears or disappears between two decades ( e.g. , @xmath12 in the former case ) , then the contribution is maximized at precisely the average frequency of the word in question .",
    "we observed in  @xcite that most large jsd contribution signals are due to words whose relative frequencies increase over time . in this paper , we confirm and explore this effect .",
    "we texture our observations by examining jsd signals due to words crossing various relative frequency thresholds in either direction , as well as the total volume of word flux in either direction across these thresholds .",
    "it is both convenient and consistent to record flux over relative frequency thresholds instead of rank thresholds . to demonstrate this consistency",
    ", we observe in fig .",
    "[ threshold_comp ] that rank threshold boundaries correspond to nearly constant relative frequency thresholds , with the exception of the top 1-gram ( always the comma ) , which decreases gradually in relative frequency . for thresholds of @xmath13 and below ,",
    "we omit signals corresponding to references to specific years , since such references would otherwise overwhelm the charts for these thresholds .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ jsd_rising_ratios ] , more than half of the jsd between a typical given decade and the next is due to contributions from words increasing in relative usage frequency .",
    "the jsds between 1820s , 1840s , and 1970s and their successive decades are the only exceptions . moreover ,",
    "when the time differential is increased to three decades , no exceptions remain .",
    "this confirms asymmetry exists between signals for words increasing and decreasing in relative use .",
    "we note relative extrema of the inter - decade jsd in the vicinity of major conflicts . between the 1860s and successive decades ,",
    "words on the rise contribute substantially to the jsd .",
    "this is consistent with words not relatively popular during wartime ( specifically the american civil war ) being used more frequently in peacetime .",
    "a similar tendency holds for the jsd between the 1910s ( world war i ) and the 1920s .",
    "this is not as apparent in the jsd between the 1910s and the 1940s , possibly because the 1940s coincide with world war ii .",
    "the absolute maximum for the single - decade curve corresponds to the divergence between the 1950s and 1960s .",
    "this suggests a strong effect from social movements .",

    "for each threshold , the upward and downward flux roughly cancel . for either direction of flux",
    ", there appears to be little qualitative difference between the three smallest thresholds for which the downward flux between the 1950s and the 1960s is a minimum , the downward flux increases over the next two pairs of consecutive decades , then it dips again between the 1980s and 1990s . for the highest threshold ,",

    "it is plausible based on these earlier observations and the observations in this paper that the distribution of the language is self - stabilizing : the overall shape of the distribution does not appear to change drastically with time or with the total volume of the data set . as old words fall out of favor",

    "furthermore , despite the fact that the divergence between consecutive years has been observed to decay over time , we find no shortage of novel word introductions during the most recent decades ( which have the lowest decade - to - decade jsds ) .",
    "this apparent dissonance clearly invites further investigation .    finally ,",
    "while extremely specific fiction can be of great interest  whether it be in the form of war novels or volumes from the `` star trek '' franchise  vocabulary from these works is more easily studied when placed in proper context .",
    "dialing down the relative frequency threshold across several orders of magnitude helps to capture this distinction .",
    "however , further experimentation is called for , since an automatic means of separating specific signals from the more general signals ( e.g. , `` star trek '' from social movements ) could allow both a more intuitive grasp of the linguistic dynamics and might , ideally , allow investigators to hypothesize causal relationships between exogenous and endogenous drivers of the language ."
