    "it is a firm experimental fact that the phase transition from normal to superconducting states of the underdoped high @xmath0 materials is accompanied by appearance of a pseudogap @xcite .",
    "while approaching the critical temperature @xmath0 from above the single particle states are gradually depleted in a certain energy region @xmath2 around the fermi level .",
    "this phenomenon is often interpreted theoretically as a precursor of the true superconducting gap which is usually predicted by the bcs - like treatments for temperatures @xmath3 . on a microscopic basis",
    "the pseudogap can be assigned to presence of the electron pairs . above @xmath0 their long - range coherence",
    "is destroyed by the strong quantum fluctuations arising either from the reduced dimensionality , or due to close neighborhood of the mott insulating state or because of a competition with various kinds of ordering in the system .",
    "the incoherent electron pairs have been unambiguously detected experimentally above @xmath0 in measurements of the large nernst coefficient @xcite and in observation of the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "there is however a great amount of controversy regarding the temperature extent where the incoherent pairs eventually exist .",
    "according to available experimental data their existence is established for at least a dozen kelvin above @xmath0 but such region can perhaps spread over a much wider regime up to @xmath4 at which the pseudogap finally closes .",
    "various tunneling techniques have been used for a long time as a useful tool for probing the single particle spectra of the correlated systems .",
    "recent technological progress of the spectroscopic methods such as the stm @xcite , the * k*-resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite , the andreev - type techniques @xcite and the fourier transformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy @xcite allow for a precise measurements of the energy , momentum and space dependent density of states .",
    "in the present work we propose to consider the n - s junction with the quantum dot located in between . in this setup one would be able not only to detect the ( pseudo)gap in the single particle excitation spectrum but , due to activation of additional transport channels ( mainly the andreev reflections ) , there would be a possibility to analyze the electron pair coherence .    our discussion here",
    "is not limited to any particular microscopic model describing the electron pair formation and their eventual coherence . on",
    "rather general grounds we investigate the proximity effect which leads to a particle - hole mixing at small energies @xmath5 and furthermore we analyze its influence on the effective charge transport through the quantum dot . in section",
    "ii we briefly introduce the problem , in particular explaining how we treat the coherent and incoherent electron pairs .",
    "next , we show the qd spectrum without any correlations ( section iii ) and for the limit of very strong correlations ( section iv ) .",
    "the main part of our study is in the section v , where we discuss the differential conductance as a function of the applied bias @xmath6 and temperature @xmath7 , both below and above @xmath0 .",

    "we assume that the normal electrode is described by the hamiltonian of noninteracting fermions @xmath18 .",
    "for description of the superconducting lead we use a general expression @xmath19 where the two - body term @xmath20 induces either the coherent ( for @xmath21 ) or incoherent electron pairs ( above @xmath0 ) .    without specifying @xmath20 nor restricting to any particular microscopic mechanism of superconductivity",
    "we use the basic bcs - type results . for the superconducting state",
    "( below the critical temperature @xmath0 ) we introduce , in a standard way , the following retarded green s function expressed in the nambu representation @xmath22 where @xmath23 measures the energies from the chemical potential .",
    "the off - diagonal terms @xmath24 have as usually a meaning of the gap in the single particle excitation spectrum of @xmath9 electrons .",
    "since the excitation gap is known to develop well above the transition temperature we follow the arguments of levin et al @xcite and impose the following phenomenological ansatz @xmath25 the first part in ( [ two_gaps ] ) is related to the superconducting order parameter @xmath26 while the latter one comes from the pseudogap . for a quantitative discussion",
    "we propose the temperature dependence given by @xmath27 the pseudogap contribution @xmath28 to the effective gap ( [ two_gaps ] ) origins from the preformed electron pairs . above @xmath0",
    "their long range coherence is missing ( hence a name of the incoherent pairs ) and such pairs ultimately dissociate at a certain temperature @xmath4 . in analogy to ( [ sc_gap ] )",
    "we propose to consider the following temperature dependence @xmath29    absence of the off - diagonal long range order above @xmath0 implies that the retarded green s function ( [ retarded_gf ] ) must reduce to a diagonal structure for all temperatures @xmath30 .",
    "in such a case the pseudogap affects the single particle spectrum only through the bcs - like shape of the diagonal part @xcite @xmath31 with the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath32 and the usual coherence factors @xmath33 .",

    "illustrates the temperature dependences described in this section .",
    "to introduce the formalism of our calculations we first start analyzing the equilibrium case @xmath37 . in the standard nambu notation",
    "we express the retarded green s function of the qd through the dyson equation @xmath38 with two contributions to the matrix selfenergy @xmath39 .",
    "this problem can be solved exactly in a case of the noninteracting qd ( @xmath40 ) when @xmath41 and the selfenergies simplify to @xcite @xmath42 the bcs coefficients @xmath43 assure that a proximity effect in the qd occurs only for temperatures @xmath21 .",

    "if one of the electrodes is a superconductor with an isotropic ( @xmath48 independent ) energy gap we can notice some qualitative ( and quantitative ) differences in the qd spectrum .    * since @xmath9 electrons can occupy no states in the energy gap @xmath49 thereby the line broadening gets reduced by 50@xmath50 and in consequence the qd peak around @xmath13 becomes more pronounced . *",

    "it is well known both from the theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite that the coulomb interactions have a remarkable influence on transport properties through the qd . in particular ,",
    "such correlations are responsible for the coulomb blockade ( observed by oscillations of the differential conductance ) and , at sufficiently low temperatures , produce the kondo resonance leading to enhancement of the conductance to the unitary limit value @xmath61 .    in this section",
    "we consider the correlations focusing on the extreme limit of @xmath62 . under such condition",
    "no double occupancy of the qd is allowed and one expects it to have a tremendous effect on the charge tunneling especially in the anomalous channels involving the electron pairs .    excluding the doubly occupied states from the hilbert space can be formally achieved using the auxiliary fields @xmath63 where the boson @xmath64 and fermion operators @xmath65 correspond to an annihilation ( creation ) of the empty and singly occupied states on the qd . these new fields must obey the local constraint @xmath66 .",
    "there are various methods to deal with the local constraint . for simplicity , we apply here the technique proposed by le guillou and ragoucy @xcite where projecting out of the doubly occupied states is achieved by appropriate commutation relations between the operators of auxiliary fields . for the present context ( [ model ] ) some necessary technical details have been previously discussed in ref .",

    "the only possible process of a charge tunneling occurs then through the andreev channel . at temperatures below @xmath0",
    "the non - vanishing conductance @xmath96 for @xmath95 is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the normal state conductance @xmath97 .    for sufficiently low temperatures @xmath98 , we observe formation of the kondo peak ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) which affects the differential conductance at small bias @xmath99 . in the present it gives some enhancement of the zero bias conductance ( see the inset of figure [ cond_vs_t ] ) through the andreev scattering .",
    "this zero bias anomaly is however rather residual as compared to the n - qd - n junctions @xcite .",
    "a strong suppression of the zero bias anomaly has been previously pointed out by several authors @xcite .",
    "we checked that the low temperature differential conductance @xmath100 fits very well the universal parabolic variation characteristic for the kondo regime .    for higher voltages ,",
    "exceeding @xmath101 , the dominant role to the charge transport comes from the normal current @xmath92 . in figure [ cond_contrib ]",

    "the in - gap conductance arising from the andreev current is very sensitive to the temperature ( see figure [ conda_vs_v ] ) .",
    "already for temperatures higher then @xmath106 the kondo peak is washed out which gives a concomitant disappearance of the zero bias anomaly . upon further increasing",
    "the temperature there occurs a gradual suppression of the andreev current which completely vanishes at @xmath107 .    for temperatures above @xmath0 the charge current",
    "is transmitted only via the normal @xmath92 channel . with an increasing temperature",
    "the pseudogap becomes gradually filled in ( see figure [ cond_vs_v ] ) therefore the zero bias conductance smoothly increases , reaching a local maximum at @xmath4 . from basic considerations",
    "@xcite it is well known that in the normal state ( for @xmath108 ) the differential conductance exponentially decreases with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "we would like to stress that the non - monotonous temperature variation of the zero bias differential conductance @xmath100 ( shown in figure [ cond_vs_t ] ) could be a useful method for identifying the temperature region of the incoherent electron pairs .",
    "we have investigated the charge tunneling from the normal ( n ) to superconducting ( s ) leads via the quantum dot ( qd ) . in agreement with the previous studies @xcite we find that the long range off - diagonal superconducting order induces the proximity effect in the quantum dot ( independently of the on - dot coulomb interaction @xmath109 ) . besides the main lorentzian peak near the single particle energy level @xmath13 there appears another small counter - peak around @xmath54 due to the particle - hole mixing .",
    "such physical situation occurs for all temperatures below @xmath0 .",
    "this effect could be practically observed in measurements of the differential conductance upon varying the gate voltage .    in a presence of the strong on - dot correlations @xmath109 there",

    "one of them is the kondo state which occurs at sufficiently low temperatures , usually below 1k @xcite .",
    "spectral function of the qd develops then a narrow peak at the fermi energy .",
    "it has a qualitative influence on the low energy transport properties . since the normal channel @xmath92 is forbidden for @xmath110 ( because of the energy gap of @xmath9 electrons ) the only possibility for the charge transfer is through the andreev tunneling .",
    "a magnitude of the andreev current is by far smaller than the normal charge current but nevertheless , in analogy to the n - qd - n kondo anomaly @xcite , we find some enhancement of the zero bias conductance for the n - qd - s setup .",
    "this anomaly shows up at temperatures @xmath78 but the conductance does not reach the unitary limit value @xmath111 .",
    "we have also extended our study on the pseudogap state and found that incoherent electron pairs have a remarkable influence on the charge transport . above @xmath0",
    "the zero bias differential conductance @xmath100 systematically increases upon increasing temperature because the pseudogap is gradually filled in .",
    "finally , at @xmath112 , it reaches a local maximum and for higher temperatures ( in the normal state ) has a changeover to the exponential decrease versus @xmath7 .",
    "such nonmonotonus variation of the zero bias conductance ( figure [ cond_vs_t ] ) can serve as a sensitive method to identify the temperature region @xmath113 of the incoherent electron pairs .",
    "some other effects which might eventually come into the play .",
    "one of them is a strong anisotropy of the gap function @xmath24 well known for all the htsc cuprates . to some extent",
    "this issue has been recently addressed by eth group @xcite .",
    "authors investigated the conductance of charge current flowing between the conducting stm tip and the quasi-2d superconducting cuo@xmath114 planes involving the apical oxygen atoms ( to be regarded as the qd ) .",
    "they focused on studying the inelastic scattering caused by the oxygen atoms vibrations . in the future work",
    "we shall discuss the normal and anomalous currents for such anisotropic gap @xmath24 of the @xmath115-wave symmetry .",
    "as known from the literature the gapless superconductivity does not preclude appearance of the kondo resonance @xcite .",
