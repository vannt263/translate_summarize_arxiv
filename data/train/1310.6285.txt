    "in this work , we address important enablers for low - dimensional pod models for complex high - reynolds - number flows . reduced order models ( rom ) are abundantly used in fluid mechanics . the purposes range from understanding of the physical mechanisms , to computational inexpensive surrogate models for optimization , to low - dimensional plants for control design . in this study , we focus on reduced - order galerkin models , as they have a convenient mathematical structure for the above mentioned purposes .",
    "the galerkin expansions may arise from mathematical completeness considerations @xcite , from eigenfunctions of navier - stokes related equations @xcite or empirical data @xcite .",
    "the majority of low - dimensional galerkin models in engineering applications are of empirical nature and utilize one or another variant of proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) .",
    "the first dynamical pod model was presented in the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "their rom describes the coherent structures in the turbulent boundary layer , particularly sweeps or ejections .",
    "other examples are the vortex shedding flow behind a circular cylinder at low reynolds number @xcite , transitional and turbulent boundary layers @xcite , a turbulent jet and the mixing layer @xcite and the lid - driven cavity flow @xcite .",
    "pod models have been presented for myriad of flow configurations , ranging from laminar , to transitional and turbulent states . yet",
    ", the construction of pod models for broad - band turbulence still constitutes a challenge .",
    "a rich set of subscale turbulence representations in pod models have been proposed .",
    "@xcite employ a single eddy viscosity term , thus effectively modelling a navier - stokes equation at lower reynolds number .",
    "@xcite have proposed mode - dependent refinement of eddy viscosities , inspired by spectral eddy viscosities of homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "all these subscale turbulence representations constitute linear terms in the mode coefficients . @xcite",
    "add an additional linear term to the galerkin system , calibrating the parameters with a solution matching technique .",
    "several authors have also proposed nonlinear terms .",
    "@xcite derive a nonlinear eddy viscosity model , based on a finite - time thermodynamics ( ftt ) closure @xcite .",
    "nonlinear models based on the galerkin projection of filtered navier - stokes equations have been pursued by @xcite .",
    "an approach of completely different nature is suggested by @xcite . here",
    ", no auxiliary subscale turbulence terms have been introduced in the galerkin system , but the dissipative effects are incorporated in a generalized pod .    in the present work , we present for the first time a rom for the highly turbulent flow around a three - dimensional vehicle bluff body , the so - called ahmed body .",
    "the ahmed model is used in vehicle aerodynamics as a generic test case that reproduces the important flow structures around passenger vehicles @xcite .",
    "recently , the model has been subjected to intensive research for the pursuit of flow control methods capable of reducing the aerodynamic drag on the model , both passive control @xcite , and active control @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on the square - back variant of the ahmed body , which is essentially a bluff body with curved front edges placed in the proximity of ground .",
    "this flow poses a severe challenge for the rom due to the bi - modal states of the wake that was discovered in the recent study by @xcite , i.e. , the flow switches from one semi - stable asymmetric state to another over time - scales , @xmath0 , that is of the order of @xmath1 where h is the height of the body and @xmath2 is the velocity of the oncoming flow .    in the proposed pod models , we employ the modal eddy viscosity refinement by @xcite and the nonlinear eddy viscosity scaling based on the ftt framework proposed by @xcite to stabilize the long - term solution behaviour .",
    "the pod model utilizes a dataset of time - resolved flow fields of the flow around the bluff body .",
    "the dataset has been produced by numerical simulations employing the large eddy simulation ( les ) technique .",
    "the les data capture the semi - stable asymmetric states and departures from these states .",
    "the flow around a similar bluff body has been simulated with a les by @xcite over one decade ago .",
    "the standard @xcite subgrid stress model was used both in that study and is used in the present study .",
    "although there has been an abundance of more intricate subgrid - stress models developed since the days of smagorinsky half a century ago , his nonlinear model has proven to be robust , highly applicable and very capable of producing unsteady solutions to complex bluff body flow cases with high accuracy that are able to yield further physical understanding of the flow dynamics .",
    "for instance , the same les technique was used to simulate the flow around the ahmed body with a 25@xmath3 angle of the rear slanted surface by @xcite , the flow around high speed trains at low reynolds numbers by @xcite , the flow around freight trains by @xcite and @xcite , and the flow around a finite tall circular cylinder by @xcite .",

    "next , (   [ sec : rom ] ) the employed galerkin models with a hierarchy of subscale turbulence representations are outlined . then , the performance of these pod galerkin models is studied (   [ sec : results ] ) and conclusions and future directions are provided (   [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",

    "the dynamical system predicts the evolution of all modal coefficients . by integrating the galerkin system in time",
    "we can obtain further long - term information about the dynamical behaviour of the original system .",
    "however , the aim is to simulate the dynamical behaviour of the ` large ' scales that presumably govern the global physics of the flow in the wake of the ahmed body .",
    "this is desirable since the computational time of computing the convective term , @xmath91 , and the integration time of the system time scales as @xmath93 , so that the computational effort soon exceeds the computational effort of the original les simulation .",
    "thus , we want to build a rom that contains the important physics , but with a computational effort to build and to integrate in time that is much less than the time of performing the original les simulations .",
    "we therefore choose a small number of modes @xmath71 accounting for the unresolved pod modes at @xmath94 with a subscale turbulence representation .",
    "let @xmath95 represent the mode coefficients .",
    "then the accurate dynamical system takes the following form :    [ eq : galerkinsystem2 ] & = & f_i ( ) + g_i ( ) , + f_i ( ) & = & _ j=0^n l_ij^ a_j + _ j , k = 0^n q_ijk^c a_j a_k , + g_i ( ) & = & _ j = n+1^l_ij^ a_j",

    "therefore , any attempt to solve the reduced system in not accounting for the residual , @xmath99 , will lead to excessive energy levels or even divergence of the system .      in the ground - breaking work by @xcite on the dynamics of coherent structures in the turbulent boundary layer",
    ", the residual was modelled by a constant ` eddy viscosity ' term , resulting in a linear subscale turbulence representation @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 is generally obtained by solution matching techniques . in this study , the eddy viscosity is derived from the tke power balance .",
    "the resulting model will be called _ galerkin system a _ and abbreviated as gs - a .      @xcite",

    "we have investigated a hierarchy of linear and nonlinear eddy viscosity terms for a pod galerkin model accounting for the unresolved velocity fluctuations .",
    "the chosen configuration is a high - reynolds number flow over a square - back ahmed body .",
    "this flow exhibits three challenging features for reduced - order models .",
    "firstly , the high reynolds number implies that a subscale turbulence representation is mandatory for realistic fluctuation levels , or even boundedness , of the galerkin system solution .",
    "secondly , the coherent structures of the ahmed body have a broadband frequency signature .",
    "the resulting frequency cross - talk implies that many modal interactions exist and need to be correctly resolved . and thirdly , the base flow has two meta - stable states with nearly constant non - vanishing side forces .",
    "experiments of a similar ahmed body configuration @xcite exhibit these asymmetric quasi - attractors .",
    "such quasi - attractors imply a complex interaction from small to very large time scales and constitute a significant modelling challenge  even for navier - stokes simulations .",
    "the solutions of a pod galerkin model with 100 modes or less converge to infinity underlining the need for a subscale turbulence presentation .",
    "four corresponding auxiliary models have been tested , using a single or modally refined eddy viscosities with constant or energy - dependent values .",
    "these parameters are determined from the total or modal tke power balance .",
    "solution matching techniques are excluded as parameter identification method , to avoid any inconsistency with the tke power balances .",
    "a single constant eddy viscosity , as used by @xcite and others , is already sufficient to stabilize the galerkin solution .",
    "modally refined viscosities , as suggested by @xcite , are found to significantly improve the accuracy of the modal fluctuation energies . yet , both approaches rely on constant eddy viscosities leading to linear subscale turbulence representations for nonlinear energy flow cascade .",
    "the resulting galerkin solutions converge to infinity if the initial conditions are far from the attractor .",
    "in addition , both galerkin systems do no exhibit the meta - stable asymmetric base flow states .",
    "we corroborate the need of eddy viscosities which scale with the square - root of the resolved fluctuation energy .",
    "the single nonlinear eddy viscosity model leads to an accurate prediction for the fluctuation levels of higher - order modes , while the amplitudes of the first 7 modes are over - predicted .",
    "arguably , the first 7 modes define the large - scale coherent structures and are the most important part of the spectrum .",
    "the modally refined eddy viscosity cures this over - prediction at the expense of a less accurate tail of the modal energy spectrum .",
    "these nonlinear eddy viscosity models are capable of resolving the flipping between asymmetric base flow states . in addition , the resulting galerkin systems convergence to their respective attractors for initial conditions  even if these are far away from them .",
    "global converge can strictly be ensured by enforcing the energy preservation on the quadratic term .",
    "this energy preservation is derivable from the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "in addition , galerkin systems with nonlinear subscale turbulence representations are shown to be much more robust with respect to changes of the eddy viscosity parameters and the dimension of the model .    the modally refined , nonlinear eddy viscosity terms have significantly increased accuracy and robustness of the galerkin system as compared to traditional linear subscale turbulence representations .",
    "the accuracy has been achieved with a parameter identification , purely based on navier - stokes equation based constraints and without solution matching techniques .",
    "the robustness is a key enabler for three rom - based applications .",
    "firstly , rom may serve as test - bed for the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "one key question is the mechanism for the amplitude selection , i.e.  what drives the transients towards the attractor .",
    "secondly , rom may be employed as a computationally inexpensive surrogate model for multiple purposes , e.g.  for the inlet conditions of the flow around a following car model . in this case",
    ", it is desirable to have rom which works over a certain range of operating conditions , e.g.  slowly varying oncoming velocity .",
    "this variability implies that the rom employs a physically correct robust amplitude selection mechanism , e.g.  does not diverge for a small change of the reynolds number .",
    "finally , model - based control design requires a rom which works robustly for a range of natural and forced transients .",
    "moreover , the control design is often based on a hierarchy of rom with different dimension  ranging from robust least - order models to more accurate higher - order models , which pose larger challenges to state estimation .",
    "the nonlinear eddy viscosity term serve all three mentioned applications .    to conclude , the proposed nonlinear subscale turbulence term with modal eddy viscosity of @xcite and energy - dependent scaling of @xcite is a recipe for accurate and robust pod models for a large class of complex flows , comprising the flow over an ahmed body as shown here , a mixing layer @xcite , and subsonic jet noise @xcite .",
