    "large samples of quasars are important tools in astrophysics and cosmology for several reasons .",

    "_ sdss - iii _ s _ baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey _",
    "( _ boss _ ; @xcite ; @xcite ) aims to do just that by obtaining spectra for @xmath8 160,000 quasars ( @xmath8 20 deg@xmath9 ) in the @xmath10 redshift range .",

    "quasar target selection must approach an efficiency of 50percent .",
    "quasar target selection in this redshift range is notoriously inefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because at @xmath11 2.8 the quasar and stellar loci cross in color space .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the fact that medium - redshift 2.2 @xmath12 quasars are relatively rare , such that to reach a density of 20 deg@xmath9 , objects must be targeted down to @xmath13 mag , where photometric uncertainties in the relatively shallow sloan digital sky survey ( _ sdss _ ) imaging can become substantial .",
    "fortunately , since the _ boss _  quasars primary use is to provide lines of sight through the intervening intergalactic medium , they do not have to be selected in a uniform manner .",
    "however , in order to allow for ancillary quasar science such as the measurement of the quasar luminosity function at the peak of quasar activity , the _ boss _  has decided to select half of the targets in a uniform manner .",
    "therefore , a quasar target - selection technique that is 50percent efficient down to @xmath13 mag at 20 targets deg@xmath9 is required .",
    "the last decade has seen the advent of statistical studies with quasars using purely photometric samples .",
    "the @xmath8 95percent efficient photometric uvx catalog of @xcite was used to measure the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite and cosmic magnification bias @xcite , and to study the clustering of quasars on large @xcite and small scales @xcite . however , with the latest catalog of @xmath8 1,000,000 photometric quasars in _ sdss _  data release 6 @xcite brighter than @xmath14 mag @xcite , the kernel - density - estimation ( kde ) technique has reached its limit , since it does not take into account the photometric uncertainties when evaluating quasar probabilities .",
    "it is already the case that ignoring the photometric uncertainties results in an incompleteness of the kde - selected catalog that is not currently understood .",
    "this makes statistical studies and follow - up of interesting sources ( e.g. , binary quasars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) difficult .",
    "the technique described in this paper for quasar target selection can also be used to construct a photometric quasar catalog down to faint magnitudes that does take photometric uncertainties into account .",
    "since the first attempts at optical selection of quasars @xcite , broad - band quasar target selection has mostly relied on the `` uv excess '' that characterizes low - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "however , this selection technique can not be used by the _ boss _",

    "an efficient and uniform medium - redshift quasar survey such as the _ boss _  can be performed .",

    "boss ] , we show results for medium - redshift targets based on early _ boss _  data . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we compare our target selection technique to other methods and describe various extensions to the basic method described in this article .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .    in what follows , ab magnitudes @xcite are used throughout .",
    "where dereddened fluxes and magnitudes are required we have used the reddening maps of @xcite .",
    "target selection is essentially a classification problem : based on a set of attributes , we must classify an object into one of a discrete set of classes .",
    "this set of classes can be as simple as target / non - target , but more classes might be beneficial in circumstances in which different targets are assigned different priorities ( see below ) .",
    "we assume that we have a set of objects with class assignments available on which we can train the classification algorithm .",
    "this is a classical problem in data analysis / machine learning , and many classification methods are available ( e.g. , neural networks , nns , @xcite ; support vector machines , @xcite ; gaussian process classification , @xcite ) .",
    "however , object attributes in astronomy are rarely measured without substantial and heterogeneous measurement uncertainties , and the training sets are rarely as noisy as the test sets that are to be classified .",
    "most classification algorithms are poorly equipped to deal with these complications in a statistically well - posed manner .",
    "they do not naturally degrade the probability of an object being in a certain class if the measurement uncertainties imply that the object overlaps several classes .",
    "a simple way to think about classification is to compare the number densities of the various classes in attribute space : if the number density of class @xmath19  is higher than that of class @xmath20  evaluated at an object s attributes , then the probability that the object belongs to class @xmath19  is higher than that it belongs to class @xmath20 , with probabilities proportional to the number densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of this density view of classification is that general density - estimation techniques exist that can handle all of the complications that necessarily arise with astronomical data , e.g. , very noisy attribute measurements or missing attributes @xcite .",
    "it also provides a clean probabilistic interpretation of the class assignments .",
    "consider an object @xmath21 with attributes @xmath22  that we wish to classify into class @xmath19  or class @xmath20 , and that these classes are an exhaustive set . in the context of quasar target selection",
    ", the attributes could be the @xmath23  fluxes of a point - like object and the classes ` quasar '  and ` star ' .",
    "we use bayes theorem to relate the probability that object @xmath21 belongs to class @xmath19  to the density in attribute space @xmath24 where @xmath25 since @xmath26 contains all of the possibilities .",
    "note that we distinguish between discrete probabilities @xmath27 and continuous probabilities @xmath28 .",
    "the first factor in the numerator of the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : bayes ] ) is the density in attribute space evaluated at the object s attributes @xmath22 , the second factor is the total number of @xmath19  objects in an unbiased sample , and the denominator is a normalization factor .",
    "it is easy to see that this probability is a true probability in the sense that it always lies between zero and one and that it sums to one .",
    "the common situation in which the attributes of object @xmath21 are measured with substantial measurement uncertainty is easily handled in this framework through marginalization over the `` true '' attributes @xmath29  based on the observed attributes @xmath22  and measurement - uncertainty distribution @xmath30 ( which can be as simple as a gaussian distribution for gaussian uncertainties ) @xmath31 where the first factor in the integral is given by equation  ( [ eq : bayes ] ) .",
    "this is again a well - defined probability .",
    "the target - selection problem then becomes the task of training good number - density models for both the target population and the contaminants population to maximize the efficiency and completeness of the survey . in regions of attribute space where the efficiency is low , for example",
    ", @xmath32 quasars where the quasar and stellar loci cross , the challenge is to develop the best possible density models for the most efficient target selection .",
    "for the purpose of the _ sdss_-_xdqso _  quasar targeting catalog we need to classify point - like objects into classes ` star '  and ` quasar ' .",
    "this assumes that star ",
    "galaxy separation is perfect for extended galaxies , such that the additional class ` galaxy '  can be ignored .",
    "if this were not the case then the class ` galaxy '  would be included and morphological attributes relevant to star  galaxy separation would be added to the attribute list @xmath22 .",
    "contamination from point - like galaxies , which is small in the apparent magnitude range of interest , is automatically handled in what follows since the training set for the ` star '  class consists of non - varying sources , which includes both stars and point - like galaxies .",

    ". objects with a high variabilitywhere the @xmath36 per degree of freedom of the distribution of @xmath37-band flux over successive calibration runs is greater than 1.4are removed as many of these objects are quasars ( see j.  a.  kirkpatrick et al . , 2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "the training set contains 701,215 objects .",
    "we identified 23,540 objects with existing spectra in this set .",
    "only 221 of these are quasars ( 120 @xmath1 ; 84 2.2 @xmath12 ; 17 @xmath3 ) indicating that the contamination of the stellar training set with quasars is small .",
    "because of this , we do _ not _ remove these known quasars from the stellar training set .",
    "the fluxes obtained during a single _ sdss _  imaging run have typical uncertainties of @xmath38 mag ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 mag ( @xmath41 ) at @xmath42 mag .",
    "the co - added photometry in stripe-82 has uncertainties that are three to five times smaller , depending on the number of imaging epochs available for an object .",
    "these multi - epoch observations also show that the single - epoch uncertainties are correct in that they explain the scatter in multiple observations of non - variable objects @xcite .",
    "we use a sample of 103,601 @xmath43 quasars from the _ sdss _  dr7 quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "this sample includes 14,063 quasars with @xmath44 and 3,519 with @xmath3 .",
    "below we model the densities of relative fluxes in a large number of narrow bins in @xmath4-band  magnitude . because the number of currently known quasars is too small to provide sufficient data in each magnitude bin , we assume that the colors of quasars are independent of their absolute magnitude",
    ". although there are well - known correlations between quasar spectral properties and luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these trends are very subtle and they mostly affect emission line shapes .",
    "these weak luminosity trends are thus washed out in broad band colors , especially in comparison to the very large intrinsic scatter .",
    "when fitting for the relative - flux distributions , this approximation allows us to re - scale the fluxes of all 103,601 quasars to the central @xmath4-band apparent magnitude of the bin in question , which is a sufficient number to obtain good fits .",
    "however , the redshift distribution at this magnitude is different from what would be observed in nature for two reasons .",
    "first , we have taken quasars selected from a broad magnitude range to be representative of the redshift distribution at the center of the bin in question .",
    "second , the redshift distribution of these 103,601 quasars is not the true quasar redshift distribution because it has the _ sdss _  quasar selection function imprinted on it ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the luminosity function dictates how the redshift distribution in a given bin depends on apparent magnitude . to correct the redshift distributions",
    ", we use a model of the quasar luminosity function @xcite to compute a set of relative weights such that the weighted histogram of the quasars results in the redshift distribution predicted by the luminosity function for that apparent magnitude bin .",
    "thus in each magnitude bin , we fit _ all _ 103,601 quasars in the training set , re - weighted to produce the right mix of low- and high - redshift quasars according to the luminosity function .",
    "to estimate the density of stars and quasars in flux space we use xd @xcite . at the faint end ( @xmath45 mag ) of the magnitude range of interest here",
    "the flux uncertainties in the training set are substantial , even though they are much smaller than the single - epoch uncertainties used to evaluate quasar probabilities for the ` star '  class ( see below ) .",
    "deconvolution is therefore necessary to avoid adding in uncertainties twice at the density - evaluation phase . while xd  can handle missing data as well",
    ", we do not need this feature here .",
    "however , this capability of xd  is crucial when we want to extend the current framework to include near - infrared ( nir ) , ultraviolet ( uv ) , or variability information , since these data will not be available for every object in the training set ( see section  [ sec : extensions ] ) .    xd  models the underlying , deconvolved , distribution as a sum of @xmath46 gaussian distributions , where @xmath46 is a free parameter that needs to be set using an external objective .",
    "it assumes that the flux uncertainties are known , as is the case for point - spread function ( psf ) fluxes for point sources in _ sdss _  @xcite .",
    "xd  consists of a fast and robust algorithm to estimate the best - fit parameters of the gaussian mixture .",
    "for example , we were able to fit the color distribution of the full stellar catalog of 701,215 objects in only a few hours using 30 four - dimensional gaussians .",
    "it is robust in the sense that even a poor initialization quickly leads to an acceptable solution .",
    "we are interested not so much in the true underlying distribution function as in finding a good fit to the observed density ( after convolving the model with the data uncertainties ) without overfitting , so it is not absolutely necessary to find the exact best fit in the complicated likelihood surface .",
    "therefore , we use the simplest version of xd  that does not use the heuristic search extension or priors on the parameters @xcite .",
    "the xd  method works by iteratively increasing the likelihood of the underlying , @xmath46 gaussian model given the data .",
    "it is an extension of the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm for fitting mixtures of gaussians in the absence of noise @xcite to the case where noise is significant or there are missing data .",
    "the algorithm basically iterates through an expectation ( e ) and a maximization ( m ) step . during the expectation",
    "step the data and the current estimate of the underlying density are used to calculate the expected value of ( a ) indicator variables that for each data point indicate which gaussian it was drawn from and ( b ) the true , noiseless value of each data point and its second moment . in the maximization step , these expected values are used to optimize the amplitude , mean , and variance of each of the @xmath46 gaussians .",
    "the e and m steps are iterated until the likelihood ceases to change substantially .",
    "the algorithm has the property that after each em iteration the likelihood of the model is increased .",
    "the full model consists of fitting the flux density in a number of bins in @xmath4-band  magnitude for the various classes of objects .",
    "we describe the model in a single bin first for a single example class . throughout",
    "we will use the ` star '  class as the example .",
    "we opted for a binning approach because the true five - dimensional distribution of fluxes has a dominant power - law shape corresponding to the number counts as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "however , most of the information for discriminating between quasars and stars is not in this power - law behavior , but in the behavior of colors or relative fluxes . while the latter can be represented well by mixtures of gaussian distributions ( see below ) , the power - law behavior can not without using large numbers of gaussians .",
    "for this reason we chose to take out the power - law degree of freedom , i.e. , the overall behavior of the density as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "neither the color distributions of quasars or that of stars is a strong function of apparent magnitude , such that the binning described below does not introduce strong assumptions about the behavior of the color distributions .",
    "any weak magnitude dependence of the color distributions is captured in our model since we use narrow bins in @xmath4-band  magnitude ( see below ) .",
    "the model only includes the fluxes of an object and not its position on the sky .",
    "since quasars are uniformly distributed on the sky , while stars are concentrated near the galactic plane , the position on the sky of an object is a potential discriminant .",
    "because the fluxes are much more informative about an object s type than its position , we do not include the position in the model .",
    "we discuss below how the model could be extended to include the position of an object as part of the model .    in a single bin in @xmath4-band  magnitude , we separate the absolute flux from the flux relative to @xmath4 in the likelihood in equation  ( [ eq : bayes ] ) as follows @xmath47 where we now specify that the attributes @xmath22  are the @xmath23  fluxes @xmath48 , @xmath49  are the fluxes relative to @xmath4 , and @xmath50  is the @xmath4-band  flux .",
    "we model these two factors separately .",
    "we model the first factor using xd  in narrow bins in @xmath4-band  magnitude described in detail below .",
    "we use relative fluxes rather than colors ",
    "logarithms of relative fluxes  since the observational uncertainties are closer to gaussian for relative fluxes than they are for colors . except for the absence of a logarithm , relative fluxes are similar to colors and have the same number of degrees of freedom , viz .",
    "the fact that fluxes must be larger than zero while the gaussian mixture model does not contain any such constraints , which is one reason to model the logarithm of the fluxes rather than the fluxes themselves , does not matter greatly here because most of the objects in the training set are at least five - sigma detections .",
    "however , for @xmath51 quasars the @xmath52-band has zero flux and the flux measurement can be negative , in which case magnitudes are badly behaved ; relative fluxes remain well - behaved in this case . to evaluate the xd  probabilities during training , we always convolve the underlying model with the objects uncertainties .",
    "we assume that the relative - flux uncertainties are gaussian  which is a good assumption because the @xmath4-band  magnitude is always measured at a reasonably signal  to  noise ratio  such that the convolution of the gaussian mixture with the uncertainties results in a gaussian mixture , with an object s uncertainty variance added to the model variance for each of the components .",
    "we model the four - dimensional relative fluxes @xmath49 , which each come with an individual , non - diagonal , four by four uncertainty covariance , using 20  gaussian components .",
    "the number 20  was decided upon as follows .",
    "for a few bins we performed xd  fits with 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 components .",
    "while fits with less than 20  components overly smoothed the observed distribution , models with more than 20  components used the extra components to fit extremely low significance features in the observed distribution .",
    "because of the scale of the full model ( see below ) no bin - by - bin objective method for setting the number of components was pursued , although we did verify that all of the resulting fits were reasonable .",
    "we model the second factor , @xmath53 , by first combining it with the number factor @xmath54 .",
    "this combined factor becomes the number density as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "this quantity will always be expressed in units of deg@xmath9 .",
    "for the ` star '  class we model the number density directly using the number counts of the training data , by spline interpolating the histogram of @xmath4-band  magnitude number counts per square degree .",
    "for the ` quasar '  class we use a model for the quasar luminosity function @xcite to calculate the number density of quasars as a function of apparent @xmath4-band  magnitude ; we multiply these theoretical number densities with a simple model for the _ sdss _  incompleteness of point sources @xmath55 designed to reproduce the incompleteness as given in @xcite . the @xmath56 factors for the various target classes",
    "are shown in  [ fig : numcounts ] .",
    "the total number densities for the various classes are given in  [ table : numcounts ] .",
    "the full model consists of 47  bins of width 0.2  mag between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , spaced 0.1  mag apart such that adjacent bins overlap .",
    "we further divide the ` quasar '  class into three subclasses corresponding to low - redshift ( @xmath59 ) , medium - redshift ( @xmath60 ; the _ boss _",
    "quasar redshift range ) , and high - redshift ( @xmath61 ) quasars .",
    "the xd  fits for all but the brightest bin for a given class are initialized using the best - fit parameters for the previous bin .",
    "there are typically @xmath62 objects in each bin for the stellar training data ; for the quasars there are 85,998 low - redshift , 14,060 medium - redshift , and 3,519 high - redshift quasars in each bin .    in each of 4 @xmath63 47 bins we fit 20 four - dimensional gaussians , yielding a total of @xmath64 parameters .      in this section",
    "we assess the performance of the xd  technique for modeling the relative flux distributions of stars and quasars , and provide examples which demonstrate that the algorithm produces excellent fits to the data .",
    "the xd  method implicitly produces an error - deconvolved model of the relative - flux distribution , which would correspond to the true parent distribution of our training set in the limit of infinite signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we refer to this as the ` underlying ' model of the data",
    ". an important test of our approach is to apply the xd  technique to the noisier single - epoch data of the stars in stripe-82 , and compare our determination of the underlying model to the much higher signal - to - noise ratio stripe-82 co - added photometry _ of the same sources_. this is a stringent test since the underlying model fit is based on much noisier single - epoch data than the co - added photometry .",
    "if the co - added photometry were perfect , then the co - added data would represent samples of the underlying model with zero noise . in practice ,",
    "even the stripe-82 co - adds are noisy at the faint end , thus the relative - flux distribution of the co - adds will be correspondingly smoothed . to make a sensible comparison we sample the underlying model at the same number of points as are in the co - added catalog in a given magnitude bin , and convolve these samples with uncertainties of the co - added data . as we do not have a model for the noise in the co - added data , and our samples are in general at different locations in relative flux space , we simply match each sample from the underlying distribution to the closest object in the co - added catalog and use that co - add object s uncertainties .",
    "the results for this exercise for a single bin are shown in s  [ fig : singlezexfit ] and [ fig : singlezexfitcolor ] .",
    "we see that the agreement between the model and the co - add truth is excellent .    after fitting the relative flux distribution of the training data we can also compare the best - fit model with the training data by convolving the model with the data uncertainties .",
    "this uncertainty - convolution is again performed by matching a sampled point to the nearest object in the training set and drawing from that object s uncertainty distribution .",
    "some results of these tests are shown in s  [ fig : bosszexfit ] to [ fig : exfitstar ] .",
    "[ fig : bosszexfit ] shows flux - flux and color - color diagrams in one of the bins in @xmath4-band  magnitude for medium - redshift quasars .",
    "the first and third columns show a sampling from the best - fit xd  model to the relative fluxes .",
    "the second and fourth columns show the data that these fits were based on : these data are quasars from the _ sdss _  dr7 quasar catalog resampled according to the quasar luminosity function as explained in section  [ sec : qsodata ] .",
    "similar figures for the other apparent magnitude bins are very similar as the distribution of quasar colors does not vary much with apparent magnitude .",
    "the same comparison for low- and high - redshift quasars was performed for quality assurance , but these figures are not shown here .",

    "this requires observing at least 15 quasars deg@xmath9 over the _ boss _  survey area .",

    "@xmath23  fluxes are available for the bulk of the _ boss _  survey footprint , this core  sample must be based on these single - epoch fluxes alone .",
    "the _ sdss_-_xdqso _  catalog presented in section  [ sec : catalog ] allows such a uniform sample to be defined while maintaining a high target efficiency . in practice",

    "even though the _ xdqso _  targeting technique was not used during the first year of _ boss _  data acquisition , we can nevertheless evaluate the _ xdqso _  performance by determining how many of the _ xdqso _  quasar targets are spectroscopically confirmed _ boss _  quasars .",
    "this is a conservative test as it presumes that the _ boss _",
    "quasar sample is highly complete ; any incompleteness would lead us to underestimate our efficiency since there would then be real quasars selected by _ xdqso _",
    "but which did not receive a _ boss",
    "_  fiber . in  [ fig : comparelike_efficiency ] we show the _ xdqso _  targeting efficiency in an area from the _ boss_. this area consists of _ boss _  observations of stripe-82 .",
    "since over eight epochs are available for most sources in stripe-82 , _ boss _",
    "quasar target selection was based on deeper co - added data and included variability selection ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is highly complete and it is therefore the best test of the _ xdqso _  technique .",
    "we only use the @xmath81 deg@xmath5 region of stripe-82 where at least 15 2.2 @xmath82 quasars deg@xmath9 were observed by the _ boss _ ; on average 27 @xmath83 quasars deg@xmath9 are available .",
    "this is close to the total number of quasars in this redshift range expected based on various quasar luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "we see that at 20 targets deg@xmath9 the efficiency is about 50percent ; the efficiency drops rapidly at higher target densities .",
    "a further test of the _ xdqso _  technique was performed during the fall of 2010 .",
    "approximately 20 medium - redshift quasar targets ( catalog tag `` ) per square degree were observed as part of the _ boss _  in a region of @xmath84 deg@xmath5 just north of _ sdss _  stripe-82 . as of 2010 november 22 ,",
    "4,593 objects were targeted and 2,194 of these were classified as 2.2 @xmath12 quasars , corresponding to an efficiency of 48percent . in section  [ sec :",
    "compare ] we compare the _ xdqso _  selection to other targeting algorithms which were tested during the first year of _ boss _",
    "commissioning .",
    "we can also use the early _ boss _  data to evaluate whether the _ xdqso _  probabilities given to objects are correct in the ensemble sense .",
    "that is , we can bin objects in @xmath85 and evaluate the fraction of these objects that are quasars .",
    "this test again assumes that the test sample of quasars is highly complete .",
    "the results from this exercise are shown in  [ fig : consistency ] .",
    "we see that the quasar probabilities appear to be overestimated .",
    "several shortcomings of the model for the quasar and stellar populations could be responsible for this result .",
    "since we used relatively small samples of stars in each bin compared to the number of quasars  the proportion being around one to one rather than reflecting the true number densities according to which stars outnumber quasars by a factor of @xmath86 down to @xmath13 mag  we probe much lower density regions for the quasars than we can for the stars .",
    "thus , in low stellar - density regions , the stellar density is likely to be underestimated with respect to the quasar densities , leading to overestimated quasar probabilities in these regions .",
    "this is unlikely to change the _ ranking _ of quasar targets significantly  most targets will be affected in the same way .",
    "quasar targeting using the _ sdss_-_xdqso _  catalog is robust with respect to this modeling problem .",
    "however , this aspect of our analysis does merit caution when taking the specific value of the quasar probabilities serious in an analysis of quasar properties .",
    "our model also does not include variations in the stellar number density with galactic latitude and longitude , so the stellar density will be underestimated in regions closer to the galactic plane .",
    "several of the extensions described in section  [ sec : extensions ] can be used to mitigate these problems with the catalog .",
    "several sophisticated methods already exist to select quasars from photometric _ sdss _  data , especially for the mid - redshift range targeted in the _",
    "boss_.      the nbc - kde photometric quasar catalog of @xcite also uses density estimation to calculate relative number densities of stars and quasars to determine quasar probabilities .",
    "it differs from the technique described in this paper in that it ( a ) uses colors rather than relative fluxes in equation  ( [ eq : exdmodel ] ) , ( b ) assumes a flat probability distribution for @xmath87 , ( c ) uses a simple kernel density estimation technique of the _ observed _ distribution of colors , thus ignoring the flux uncertainties of the training data , and ( d ) ignores the flux uncertainties of the data at evaluation .",
    "since the catalog is limited to @xmath88 mag , ignoring the flux uncertainties is mostly harmless , although medium and high redshift quasars have very low @xmath52- and @xmath89-band fluxes with large associated uncertainties .",
    "this assumption also makes it harder to extend the catalog to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the nbc - kde catalog also does not compute exact kernel - density likelihoods for all of the _ sdss _  data because of computational limitations . the xd  technique permits these likelihoods to be computed for all of the data ( see above ) .",
    "we compare the _ xdqso _  catalog with the nbc - kde catalog by ( a ) limiting the _ xdqso _  catalog to the _ sdss _  dr6 footprint , since the nbc - kde catalog only covers this area , ( b ) limiting the _ xdqso _  catalog to @xmath88 mag , and ( c ) limiting the nbc - kde catalog to @xmath90 , the bright limit of the _ xdqso _  catalog .",
    "we select those targets in the nbc - kde catalog with `` @xmath91 and then select equal numbers of targets from the `` entries in the _ xdqso _  catalog in the three shared target classes of the two catalogs : `` , `` , and `` .",
    "note that the `` flags in the two catalogs are different .",
    "the results of this comparison are given in  [ table : kde ] .",
    "the confirmed quasars in this  come from a compilation of all spectroscopically confirmed quasars .",
    "the bulk of these are _ sdss _  quasars that were selected to be brighter than @xmath92 mag .    we stress that this comparison is significantly biased in favor of the nbc - kde catalog : the nbc - catalog was allowed",
    "to set the target threshold and its `` flag includes cuts on galactic latitude that we did not apply to the _ xdqso _  catalog . nevertheless , we see that the two catalogs perform similarly for low - redshift quasars , and that the _ xdqso _  technique performs better in the mid - redshift range where the quasar and stellar loci overlap and photometric target selection is difficult .",
    "the nbc - kde catalog performs better at high - redshift than the _ xdqso _  catalog .",
    "this is not unexpected as we only used 150 deg@xmath5 of stellar data to train the _ xdqso",
    "_  algorithm .",
    "the red - star stellar - locus outliers that contaminate @xmath3 quasar selection are very rare on the sky : if we assume that they are ten times more abundant than @xmath51 quasars we expect our stellar training set to only contain about 2,000 of these .",
    "this is not enough to model their color distribution since they are spread over all magnitude bins . in the following section",
    "we discuss improvements to the _ xdqso _  technique that can improve high - redshift quasar selection .",
    "the quasar - selection technique of @xcite uses a neural network ( nn ) to select quasars in the _ boss _  mid - redshift range .",
    "this technique uses as the input variables the four colors @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , the @xmath89-band magnitude , and the five magnitude uncertainties .",
    "these 10 variables are propagated through a simple nn that is trained on sets of known quasars and point - like objects from _ sdss _",
    "dr7 to obtain an output parameter `` on which potential targets can be ranked .",
    "a similar nn is used to find a photometric redshift `` for the quasar targets . to select targets in the mid - redshift range they recommend the cuts `` @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "while this technique uses the photometric uncertainties , it does this in a black - box manner that is quite different from the probabilistic way in which xd  treats the uncertainties ; the nn approach can not work well when the test set is noisier than the training set .",
    "we use the version of the nn technique that is part of the official _ boss _  quasar selection framework to compare the _ xdqso _  technique and the nn technique at different target densities using early _ boss _  data . for",
    "the nn we first make the cuts listed above and then rank the targets on `` until we reach the desired target density . for _ xdqso _",
    "we rank the `` targets based on `` ( see  [ table : catdescription ] ) .",
    "the results from this comparison for _ boss _  year - one observations of stripe-82 are shown in  [ fig : comparelike_efficiency ] .",
    "we see that the neural network performs significantly worse than _ xdqso _  at all target densities .",
    "the _ likelihood _  technique of j.  a.  kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2011 , in preparation ) uses an approach similar to the nbc - kde catalog . rather than colors it uses fluxes , such that the apparent magnitude factor also used by _",
    "is automatically taken into account , and rather than a kernel with an optimized bandwidth , _ likelihood _  uses a delta function  corresponding to a model of the underlying density consisting of delta functions centered at the location of each object in the respective training set .",
    "these delta functions are convolved with the flux - uncertainties at evaluation such that a smooth density is obtained nevertheless .",
    "the _ likelihood _  technique uses a similar stellar training data as the _ xdqso _  catalog .",
    "the quasar training set is also modeled by re - sampling the quasar luminosity function , but these are essentially the same set of quasars used to train the _ xdqso _  technique . rather than simulating relative fluxes only",
    ", a full quasar catalog with five - dimensional @xmath23  fluxes in the relevant magnitude range is simulated .",
    "the _ likelihood _  technique uses the flux uncertainties to smooth the discrete underlying delta - function distribution of its training sets .",
    "however , since it does not use an optimized bandwidth , there is the danger that the density might be undersmoothed in certain regions . at the faint end , where the training set has a significant contribution from the uncertainties , the _ likelihood _  method",
    "also effectively convolves with the uncertainties twice .",
    "this follows because the training set is a sample from the observed distribution of fluxes , rather than the true underlying distribution ; the former is the latter convolved with the uncertainty distribution . finally , as with the nbc - kde catalog , the calculation of the quasar and star probabilities is extremely slow compared to _",

    "the two methods perform similarly , with a slightly better performance for the _ xdqso _  catalog over the whole range .    a further comparison between the _ xdqso _  and the _ likelihood _  methods for medium - redshift quasar selection was performed during the fall of 2010 using _ boss _  observations of an @xmath84 deg@xmath5 region just north of stripe-82 ( see section  [ sec : boss ] ) .",
    "both methods were given similar target densities to allow for a direct comparison .",

    "of the 4,593 _ xdqso _  targets 2,194 were classified as 2.2 @xmath100 quasars , while of the 4,853 _ likelihood _  targets only 2,056 turned out to be medium - redshift quasars . from this test and",
    "that in  [ fig : comparelike_efficiency ] we conclude that the _ xdqso _  technique s performance is about 10percent better than that of the _ likelihood _  method for the selection of medium - redshift quasars .",
    "one of the main advantages of the general target selection technique and in particular of the specific _ xdqso _  implementation described in this article  is that it can easily be extended in a variety of ways .",
    "these extensions can be changes to the model  such as different number count priors , the addition to the model of other data such as nir  or uv  observations  or the combination of the flux - based selection described here with target selection based on variability information .",
    "all of these extensions are described briefly here .",
    "most of these extensions involve only some of the factors in equations  ( [ eq : bayes ] ) and ( [ eq : exdmodel ] ) . since we provide all of these factors separately in the _ sdss_-_xdqso _",
    "catalog , extensions that do not change all of the factors can use some of the information in the catalog . for example , extensions that only change the number count priors , e.g. , @xmath53 or @xmath54 , will not need to re - calculate the relative - flux likelihoods  the most expensive of the factors in equation  ( [ eq : exdmodel])but can instead re - use the catalog values .",
    "quasar selection from broad - band fluxes can be improved by the addition of nir  or uv  fluxes to the optical fluxes used to create the _ sdss_-_xdqso _  catalog ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the _ galaxy evolution explorer _",
    "( _ galex _ ; @xcite ) has completed a near full - sky survey in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the _ ukirt infrared deep sky survey _ ( _ ukidss _ ; @xcite ) is observing a large part of the _ sdss _  footprint in the nir .",
    "however , this situation is complicated by the fact that these surveys are generally shallower than the optical fluxes available from _ sdss _ , such that most of the objects in the _ sdss _  catalog are not detected at high significance in these surveys .",
    "since these surveys have point - spread functions that are worse than that of the _ sdss _ , low signal - to - noise measurements of the nir  and uv  fluxes of many of the objects in the _ sdss _  catalog can be obtained by forced photometry of the _ galex _  or _ ukidss _",
    "images at the _ sdss _  positions , which can be regarded as truth because of the difference in resolution .",
    "because there are gaps in these surveys , it will still be the case that some objects in both the training set and the evaluation set will not have measured nir  or uv  fluxes .    to use these low signal - to - noise or non - existent fluxes",
    ", it is necessary to employ a classifier than can handle the data uncertainties correctly and that can handle missing data , both for training and for evaluation of the quasar probabilities .",
    "the _ xdqso _  method described in this article  is the only technique to date that can do this task naturally and it is therefore the only method available that  in a straightforward way  can use all of the available information for an object to classify it as a star or quasar .    the procedure to use the nir  or uv  data is the following : we combine the optical @xmath23  fluxes in our training sets of quasars and stars with the available nir  or uv  data .",
    "we then train the xd  model for the relative fluxes on the combined relative optical plus nir  or uv  fluxes , using missing relative fluxes  e.g .",
    ", by using a very large uncertainty variance for these  where nir  or uv  fluxes do not exist .",
    "then for those objects in the evaluation set ( e.g. , the _ sdss _  dr8 catalog ) with measured nir  or uv  fluxes , we replace the relative - flux likelihoods based on @xmath23  fluxes in the _ sdss_-_xdqso _",
    "catalog with those likelihoods calculated using optical plus nir  or uv  fluxes .",
    "the apparent @xmath4-band  magnitude factors do not change , as these are functions of @xmath4 alone .",

    "it can also be used to select targets based on _ sdss _  and _ ukidss _  fluxes where the _ sdss _  and _ ukidss _  overlap , or to use only some of the redder optical bands plus nir  data to avoid potential biases due to the inclusion of bluer optical bands @xcite .      with the opening of the time - domain in the near - future with surveys such as _ pan - starrs _",

    "some of these techniques currently amount to drawing the equivalent of `` color - boxes '' in variability space to select quasars @xcite , while others perform more sophisticated model selection @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that the variability technique could be brought under the umbrella of probabilistic target selection by doing density estimation in the space of variability attributes ( such as parameters of the structure function ) in a similar manner as we did in flux space in this article .",
    "the variability data can be used to form a variability - likelihood similar to the relative - flux likelihood used in equation  ( [ eq : exdmodel ] ) . if we assume that the variability of a quasar is independent of its ( relative ) flux  not necessarily a good assumption  we can combine the relative - flux and variability likelihoods by simply multiplying the quantities .",
    "alternatively , we can perform density estimation in the combined space of relative fluxes and variability parameters , and use the combined likelihood instead of the relative - flux likelihood in equation  ( [ eq : exdmodel])this will capture any ( relative ) flux dependence of the variability of quasars . combining variability and",
    "flux information is our best hope to create extremely efficient quasars surveys in the future that are free from the biases associated with color or variability selection alone .",
    "all of the factors in equation  ( [ eq : exdmodel ] ) can be improved upon using existing data and the _ xdqso _  target selection technique .",
    "for example , we used a star count model that is not a function of galactic coordinates , but we know that the number density of stars is a strong function of galactic latitude and galactic longitude .",
    "both the total stellar number counts in  [ table : numcounts ] and the stellar number counts as a function of apparent magnitude in  [ fig : numcounts ] could be re - calculated using models for the stars counts in different directions .",
    "however , this will not lead to significant changes in the calculated quasar and star probabilities , as the distribution on the celestial sphere of photometrically selected quasars and stars already follows the expected celestial distributions of quasars and stars quite well ( see above and  [ fig : radec ] ) .",
    "we also used relative - flux distributions for the stars that do not depend on the celestial location of an object .",
    "however , the colors of stars do change with proximity to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , we could have used a model that reconstructs the relative flux distribution of stars as a function of the position on the sky .",
    "such a model is hard to produce from the current data , if we do not want to rely on theoretical models for this dependence , since we have no way _ a priori _ to separate quasars from stars all over the sky .",
    "what we can do is model the relative - flux distribution of all point sources as a function of position on the sky , from the single - epoch _ sdss _  fluxes available on the _ sdss _  footprint . in order to use the noisy single - epoch fluxes properly",
    ", it is again necessary to use a technique such as _ xdqso _  that uses the uncertainties correctly . using the model for the quasar",
    "fluxes that we have been using in this article  we can calculate quasar probabilities by using the quasar model in the numerator of equation  ( [ eq : normalize ] ) and the model for all point sources in the denominator . however , it is then possible for the probability to exceed one , since the probability is not explicitly normalized .",
    "we could also use a training set consisting of point sources over the entire _ sdss _  footprint rather than the 150 deg@xmath5 area of stripe-82 to increase our sampling of rare stellar - locus outliers . as mentioned above ,",
    "red stellar - locus outliers outnumber high - redshift quasars and are a significant contaminant for high - redshift quasar selection .",
    "our current training set does not contain enough of these red stellar outliers to model their relative flux distribution . by extending our stellar training sample to the full @xmath101 deg@xmath5 _ sdss _  footprint",
    "we would have about 100 times more stellar outliers and we could model their color distribution .",
    "this would significantly improve high - redshift quasar target selection .",
    "inference ( bayesian or frequentist ) only assigns relative _ probabilities _ on outcomes or models .",
    "it does not tell you what to do ; this also involves your capability , e.g. , the number of fibers you can use per square degree and their minimal spacing , and your utility , e.g. , signal - to - noise in the lyman-@xmath6 forest for the _ boss _",
    "quasar baryon - acoustic - feature detection .",
    "the decision to cut metal in the spectroscopic plate ( in the case of the _ boss _ ) is a hard decision that can not , in the end , be probabilistic .",
    "the probabilistic results permit calculations of expected utility , which can be used to set decisions , such as whether to prefer quasar targets to luminous - red - galaxy targets in the case of fiber collisions in the _ boss_. the _ boss _",
    "targeting decisions are unlikely to be made this way , but in situations in which inference is accurate , and ( this is rarer ) utility can be calculated , it should improve overall efficiency and capability .    to be more specific , different quasars with different properties will have different value for any individual scientific project .",
    "for example , for the lyman-@xmath6 baryon acoustic feature analysis the _ boss _  is expected to obtain more information from quasars that are brighter , and quasars in certain redshift ranges . at the same time",
    ", different quasars with different properties will be easier and harder to select , because of their photometric differences and similarities with stellar sources or other contaminants .",
    "it will usually be a frequent occurrence that one will decide , when comparing two sources , to target the object less likely to be a quasar because the lower probability is compensated by greater value to the survey if the object is indeed a quasar .    additionally , some classes of contaminants can have higher utility than others , and one might decide to preferentially target quasars that are more likely to be confused with useful contaminants .",
    "for example , some contaminants for the _ boss _  quasar target selection are bhb stars , which are very useful for studies of galactic structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hypervelocity stars .",
    "future surveys might decide to combine different science goals with different classes of targets , and probability - based utilities are then essential to most efficiently achieve all of the science goals .",
    "the _ xdqso _  method described in this article  is a new general target selection technique that can be used to design highly efficient surveys for faint objects that are hard to distinguish from contaminants based on their measured attributes .",
    "this high efficiency is achieved through the use of the extreme - deconvolution density - estimation to classify objects based on the number densities of desired objects and contaminants in attribute space .",
    "we used this approach to create an input catalog for _ boss _",
    "quasar target selection , which aims to target @xmath77 @xmath102 quasars over @xmath103 deg@xmath5 at 50-percent efficiency down to @xmath13 mag .",
    "quasar colors in this redshift range overlap strongly with stellar colors and classification is made even more difficult by the large photometric uncertainties at these faint magnitudes .",
    "we demonstrated that at the 20 targets deg@xmath9 required for the _ boss _",
    "` core ' sample the _ xdqso _  technique is indeed approximately 50percent efficient and that it outperforms all other medium - redshift quasar target selection techniques .",
    "we release the full 160,904,060-object _ sdss_-_xdqso _  quasar targeting catalog containing star and low- , medium- and high - redshift quasar probabilities for all primary objects in the @xmath104 dereddened @xmath4-band  magnitude range in _ sdss _",
    "we also release code to reproduce the catalog from the _ sdss _  point - source catalog .",
    "the _ xdqso _  target selection technique can be extended to include low signal - to - noise data in nir  and uv  filters and to include other information such as quasar variability .",
    "it is the low signal - to - noise ratio regime at the faint edge of surveys that often contains the most interesting objects .",
    "_ xdqso _  is the only target selection technique currently available that can calculate robust quasar probabilities taking the data - uncertainties fully into account .",
    "since the most successful photometric quasar catalogs are based on calculating good photometric quasar probabilities @xcite , the _ xdqso _  technique or similar will be essential to create the best and largest photometric quasar catalogs in upcoming surveys such as _ pan - starrs _  and _",
