    "in the energy region of few tens of mev around @xmath2 , the  production cross section is largely dominated by the non - resonant processes @xmath12",
    ". however , in a region closer to @xmath2 , a contribution from the ozi and g - parity violating decay @xmath8  is expected .",
    "this strongly suppressed decay can be observed only through the interference pattern with the previous reaction , which shows up as a dip in the production cross section as a function of the center of mass energy ( ) . a fit to the cross section energy dependence allows us to extract the @xmath8  branching fraction ( br ) .",
    "there is a much more complicated interference scenario for the @xmath13 channel .",
    "here we expect contributions also from @xmath14 and @xmath15 intermediate states , where @xmath16 is a scalar meson . in another paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that at @xmath17 the interference between @xmath15 and @xmath18 events , evaluated by fitting the -  dalitz plot , is small . assuming this effect to be negligible to first order , a fit to the cross section interference pattern for this final state will nevertheless give information about the @xmath19 process and the resonant decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 . comparing with the fit to the  channel , the ratio @xmath22 can be extracted .",

    "equal - energy positron and electron beams collide at an angle of @xmath25 - 25 mrad , producing @xmath11-mesons nearly at rest .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber , dc , surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter , emc . a superconducting coil around the emc provides a 0.52 t field .",
    "the drift chamber  @xcite , 4  m in diameter and 3.3  m long , has 12,582 all - stereo tungsten sense wires and 37,746 aluminium field wires .",
    "the chamber shell is made of carbon fiber - epoxy composite and the gas used is a 90% helium , 10% isobutane mixture .",
    "these features maximize transparency to photons and reduce @xmath26 regeneration and multiple scattering .",
    "the position resolutions are @xmath27150 @xmath28 m and @xmath29  2 mm .",

    "the readout granularity is ( 4.44.4 )  @xmath31 , for a total of 2440 cells .",
    "the energy deposits are obtained from the signals amplitude while the arrival times of particles and the positions in three dimensions are obtained from the time differences .",

    "a cosmic veto reject events where at least two outermost emc layers are fired .",
    "as mentioned before , in the energy region below 1.4 gev the @xmath39 production cross sections are dominated by the non - resonant process + @xmath40 . at @xmath17",
    ", the decay @xmath41 also contributes and interferes with the other processes . in the neutral channel",
    "there are also contributions from @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the center of mass energy can be parametrized in the form @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the bare cross section for the non - resonant process , @xmath44 is the complex interference parameter ( i.e. the ratio between the @xmath11 decay amplitude and the non resonant processes ) , while @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the mass , the width and the inverse propagator of the @xmath11 meson respectively .",
