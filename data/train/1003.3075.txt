    "the phenomenon of quantum entanglement in physical systems remains a subject of considerable scientific interest .",
    "the case of entanglement in bi - partite systems is relatively well understood @xcite , but the case of systems consisting of several subsystems is much more demanding and complicated .",
    "for instance , the measures characterizing quantitatively quantum entanglement worked out for the simplest case of two subsystems @xcite are often not capable to describe the complexity of multi - partite entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "the measures applicable in this case , like the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite related to the minimal distance of the analyzed pure state to the set of separable states , are in general not easy to compute .",
    "not being in position to characterize entanglement of a concrete state of a composed quantum system , one often tries to describe properties of a ` generic ' quantum state . to this end one",
    "constructs _ ensembles _ of quantum states and computes interesting quantities averaged over the entire ensemble .",
    "in the simplest case of a system consisting of two subsystems one considers an ensemble of random pure states distributed uniformly with respect to the natural , unitarily invariant ( fubini - study ) measure .",
    "quantum entanglement with respect to the partition into these subsystems called @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be described by its _",
    "entanglement entropy _ , @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath12 denotes the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath13 obtained by the partial trace of the state @xmath14 .",
    "as the initial state is pure , the resulting entropy does not depend on the subsystem , with respect to which the partial trace is taken .",
    "the entropy is bounded from above by the log of the smaller dimensionality , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "if this bound is saturated , the initial pure state is called _ maximally entangled_.    the mean entanglement entropy @xmath17 , averaged over the ensemble of random pure states depends only on the dimensionality of both subsystems .",
    "an explicit formula for the mean entropy of a subsystem was first conjectured by page @xcite and later proved in @xcite . due to the measure concentration phenomenon",
    "the entanglement entropy of a generic pure state is close to the mean value @xmath18 .",
    "concrete bounds relying on the levy s lemma @xcite specify the probability to find a random state with entropy of entanglement smaller than @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "note that the fubini - study measure on the space of pure states of the entire system followed by the partial trace over subsystem @xmath10 induces a probability measure in the space of mixed quantum states describing the subsystem @xmath9 .",
    "these induced measures @xcite are parameterized by the dimensionality of the auxiliary subsystem @xmath10 .    analyzing an ensemble of the reduced random states @xmath13 , page derived the probability distribution for its eigenvalues .",
    "up to an overall normalization constant this problem is equivalent to finding the density of the spectrum of the wishart matrices @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is a rectangular complex random matrix of the ginibre ensemble ) studied earlier by marchenko and pastur @xcite .",
    "this very distribution depending only on the ratio @xmath22 of dimensions of both subsystems , is also called _",
    "free poissonian _ , as it corresponds to the free convolution of random matrices @xcite .    in the general case of pure random quantum states describing multipartite systems",
    "one usually studies entanglement with respect to various cuts of the entire system into two parts @xcite , so the standard measures of the bi - partite entanglement can be applied .",
    "statistical properties of random pure states change if one breaks the overall unitary invariance , characteristic to the fubini - study measure , and introduces some structure into the multi - partite system .",
    "in particular , for certain numbers of subsystems there exist perfect _ maximally multipartite entangled states _ ( mmes ) , such that they are maximally entangled with respect to any bi - partition @xcite .",
    "random quantum states are useful to tackle various problems of theoretical physics . a key conjecture of the theory of quantum information processing concerning the additivity of minimal output entropy was recently shown to be false @xcite .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the original reasoning was not constructive but it was based on relations between the average quantities computed with respect to an ensemble of quantum states .",
    "entanglement between random states is also interesting in systems motivated by condensed matter physics @xcite . for a discussion of a relationship between quantum criticality , anderson transition and the average entanglement entropy see the recent review @xcite and references therein .",
    "the theory of random pure states proved to be useful to analyze the information flow and the entropy of black holes .",
    "the model of page @xcite consisted of two subsystems , the dimensions of which served as parameters of the model . in later models one studied pure states of a system composed of four parties @xcite .",
    "the system contains two pairs of maximally entangled states which relate subsystems @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 are directly coupled together , and the action of an unknown hamiltonian is mimicked by a random unitary matrix distributed according to the haar measure .",
    "such a system can symbolically be depicted by a graph containing two edges , which represent two maximally entangled states and a vertex denoting a random unitary matrix .",
    "this very situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2-edge - graph]b , where a slightly different notation is used .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to extend this construction for an arbitrary ( undirected ) graph and to investigate properties of the resulting ensembles of multi - partite random quantum pure states .",
    "any graph with @xmath1 edges will be associated with a quantum system consisting of @xmath2 subsystems .",
    "each edge corresponds to a maximally entangled state while each vertex represents a random unitary matrix .",
    "the dimensions of two subsystems linked by a given edge of the graph are assumed to be equal , but besides this constraint the dimensions of all the subspaces can be treated as free parameters of the model . as the physical interaction",
    "is modeled by a set of random unitary matrices each graph defines an entire ensemble , we call them _ random graphs states_.    note that such an _ ensemble _ of quantum random states associated with a given graph differs form the deterministic construction of _ graph states _ introduced by hein et al . @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our approach is not related to _ quantum graphs _ reviewed by gnutzmann and smilansky @xcite , which describe quantum particles ( or waves ) traveling along a graph .",
    "a graphic representation of ensembles of random states analyzed in this work looks slightly similar to the one used to define the projected entangled pair states ( peps ) formalism , capable to describe complex many - body systems @xcite .",
    "while in the latter setup the subsystems entangled with auxiliary systems are coupled together by a projection on a low dimensional subspace , in our approach such a coupling is described by a random unitary matrix .",
    "any graph defines the topology of couplings between the physical subsystems . choosing a certain set of the subsystems one can average the pure quantum state @xmath25 over the remaining subsystems .",
    "technically one performs the partial trace the auxiliary subsystems , which leads to a reduced state which generically is not pure . hence selecting a concrete graph and specifying the subsystems pertaining to the environment we define an ensemble of random mixed states .    in this work",
    "we develop general techniques suitable to describe spectral properties of random density matrices associated with a graph .",
    "our technique relies on weingarten calculus @xcite , and the observation that its asymptotics boil down to a min - flow problem @xcite . in the asymptotic limit , as the dimension of the quantum states goes to infinity , statistical properties the spectrum of a random state can be established , so explicit formulae for its purity and entropy are derived .",
    "we identify these ensembles of random states for which spectra are described by the free poisson ( marchenko - pastur ) distribution . in some other cases",
    "the spectra are described by a discrete family of probability distributions @xmath26 , which can be be considered as generalizations of the free poissonian distribution .",
    "we call them _ fuss- catalan distributions _ ( fc ) , since their moments are related to the fuss - catalan numbers , known in the combinatorics and free probability calculus @xcite .",
    "the fuss - catalan probability distributions are also closely related with properties of _ products _ of non - hermitian random matrices . in general , products of random matrices are often studied in context of various problems of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "recent studies on products of ginibre matrices concern multiplicative diffusion processes @xcite , rectangular correlation matrices used in macroeconomic time series @xcite and lattice gauge field theories @xcite .",
    "spectral properties of a product of random ginibre matrices were analyzed in a recent paper of by burda et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the simplest case @xmath27 random matrices described by the distribution @xmath28 have the structure @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are independent random ginibre matrices . in the general case of an arbitrary integer",
    "@xmath32 the random states are proportional to the wishart matrix @xmath20 , constructed out of a product of @xmath32 independent ginibre matrices , @xmath33 .",
    "to analyze statistical properties of random states whose definition is based on random unitary matrices , one needs to perform averages over the group of unitary matrices .",
    "instead of using explicit formulae derived by mello @xcite we found it more convenient to use the weingarten calculus ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in order to evaluate expectation values for random tensors",
    "we are going to use a diagramatic approach and a graphical calculus recently developed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : ensembles of pure states corresponding to classical graphs are defined in section [ sec : graph - states ] . in section [ sec :",
    "marginals ] , we discuss mixed states which arise by taking the partial trace over a specified set of subsystems . in section [ sec : unitary - integration ] graphical and combinatorial tools used to perform integration over the unitary group are described .",
    "the main result of this work  a general technique to compute the moments of the spectrum of ensembles of mixed states obtained by partial trace  is presented in section [ sec : main - result ] . in section [ sec : applications ] we analyze ensembles associated to some particular graphs ( star graphs , cycle graphs ) and find ensembles of mixed states characterized by marchenko - pastur and fuss - catalan distributions . some other graphs which lead to other , `` exotic '' distributions are also provided .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 7 in which we summarize results obtained and present a list of open questions .",
    "in this section we describe a family of quantum pure states that are associated in a natural way with undirected graphs .",
    "the underlying idea is that vertices of graphs correspond to quantum systems and edges describe the entanglement between the systems .",
    "a particular feature of the states we consider is that the entanglement described by the edges will be maximal .",
    "consider an undirected graph @xmath34 consisting of @xmath1 _ edges _ ( or _ bonds _ ) @xmath35 and @xmath0 _ vertices _ @xmath36 .",
    "we allow multiple edges between two vertices , as well as vertex loops .",
    "note that the graphs considered here are not metric , so we do not discuss the lengths of the edges .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the degree of the vertex @xmath38 defined as the number of edges attached to this vertex ( each loop counts twice ) .",
    "as an example , for the graph @xmath34 in figure [ fig : graph - example ] , we have @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "we are going to analyze quantum states belonging to the hilbert space with the @xmath42-fold tensor product structure , @xmath43 .",
    "the dimension of the subspace @xmath44 is @xmath45 , where the parameters @xmath46 are fixed while the number @xmath47 is arbitrary and we will eventually discuss the limit @xmath48 .",
    "the total dimension of space @xmath49 reads thus @xmath50 .",
    "a graph @xmath34 with @xmath1 edges induces a tensor product structure of the @xmath2-fold tensor product space @xmath51 .",

    "the reader can think about the hilbert spaces @xmath56 living inside the vertex @xmath52 . for each vertex @xmath52",
    ", we introduce the hilbert space @xmath57 which describes the @xmath58 subsystems of the vertex @xmath52 .",
    "each edge of the graph represents the maximally entangled states between two hilbert spaces @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely , we shall ask that @xmath61 and we put @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are orthonormal bases for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the actual choice of the two bases is not important in what follows , but we shall assume that these bases are fixed .    in order to introduce an ensemble of _ random graph states _ belonging to @xmath51 we are going to use @xmath0",
    "independent , random matrices @xmath65 , distributed according to the haar measure .",
    "the matrix @xmath66 corresponds to the @xmath67-th vertex of the graph , @xmath52 .",
    "it acts on the space @xmath68 ( and thus on @xmath69 subspaces ) and describes the coupling at a given vertex . to specify the subspaces coupled by a unitary matrix it will be also convenient to use an alternative notation and write @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the degree of the vertex .",
    "see figure [ fig : graph - example ] for a concrete example of a graph and a graph ensemble .",
    "the simplest graph ensembles described by our model have only one edge .",
    "we consider two cases , one where the unique edge is a loop of one vertex , and the second one where the edge connects two vertices ( see figure [ fig:1-edge - graph ] ) .    in the first situation ,",
    "the graph has a single vertex of degree two .",
    "this graph corresponds to the system consisting of @xmath72 subsystems .",
    "the edge represents the maximally entangled state , but due to the global unitary matrix @xmath73 , @xmath74 is a random state in @xmath75 . since @xmath76 is generated according to the haar measure , the random state @xmath77 is distributed uniformly with respect to the fubini - study measure , as in the model of page @xcite ,",
    "so in this case the bond forming the loop is in a sense redundant .    in the linear case",
    ", we have again only one edge , @xmath78 , two vertices , @xmath79 , and each vertex contains only one node .",
    "the graph is represented in figure [ fig:1-edge - graph ] ( c ) and ( d ) , both in the simplified and in the standard form .",

    "to study non - local properties of the random graph state @xmath77 associated to a graph @xmath34 it is useful to specify a partition of the set of all @xmath2 subsystems into two groups , @xmath104 .",

    "the entanglement of a bipartite pure state can be measured by the von neumann entropy of the reduced state obtained from the initial projector @xmath105 by the partial trace .",
    "we will analyze the partial trace of the pure state @xmath106 over a subspace @xmath107 defined by the subset @xmath108 of the set @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath109 denotes the complementary subset , so the sum of their elements @xmath110 is equal to @xmath111 and the entire hilbert space can be written as a tensor product , @xmath112 .",
    "such a partial trace will be briefly denoted by @xmath113 and the resulting density matrix is supported then by the subspace @xmath114 ,    @xmath115    graphically , partial traces are denoted at the graph by `` crossing '' the spaces @xmath59 which are being traced out .",

    "however , after the unitary transformations , subsystems @xmath121 and @xmath122 become entangled ( generically ) ; one might say that entanglement was broadcasted by the unitary matrix @xmath127 .    in general , we define the partition @xmath128 by @xmath129_{{\\pi_\\text{vertex } } } \\nsubseteq t,\\ ] ] where @xmath130_{{\\pi_\\text{vertex}}}$ ] denotes the block of @xmath131 and @xmath132 in @xmath53 .",

    "the block structure of @xmath133 is then given by the restriction of the partition @xmath134 to the set @xmath109 .",
    "for the graph in figure [ fig : broadcasting ] , we have @xmath96 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . since the unitary @xmath138 is not completely traced out , it is capable to broadcast the entanglement between subsystems @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "we finish this section by a remark which can simplify the structure of graph state marginals in some cases .",
    "if a marginal of the pure state ( [ eq : def - graph - state ] ) is considered , the unitaries @xmath148 corresponding to singletons @xmath149 in equation ( [ eq : def - graph - state ] ) can be replaced by the identity operator if the pair @xmath132 of @xmath131 in @xmath93 is not a singleton in @xmath53 .",
    "this follows from the invariance of the haar measure on the unitary group and from the fact that one can extract an independent unitary from the block of @xmath132 in @xmath53 .",

    ", one can analyze the typical correlations between these parts . technically , one studies the entropy of entanglement between both subsystems , defined as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix .",

    "these distributions are characteristic of random matrices with the structure @xmath723 , where @xmath724 is a product of @xmath32 independent ginibre matrices .",
    "moreover , we identified other examples of the graphs , for which the spectra are described by an even wider class of `` exotic '' distributions .    the model presented here can be generalized in many directions . instead of a maximally entangled pure state @xmath725 belonging to @xmath726 ,",
    "each edge of the graph could represent a generic random entangled state @xmath727 , such that the non - negative numbers @xmath728 sum to unity .",
    "for instance , the random vector @xmath729 may be generated according to the hilbert - schmidt measure @xcite , which corresponds to taking a random state of size @xmath730 .",
    "such a generalization makes the model more realistic , but it should not change qualitatively the results obtained , since the mean entanglement entropy of the corresponding bi - partite system changes from @xmath731 to @xmath732 .",
    "any graph analyzed in this work may also represent a physical system in a different way . in this dual setup",
    "any bond represents a random unitary matrix which couples two corresponding subsystems , while any vertex with @xmath476 bonds represents a @xmath476-particle ghz - like entangled state .",
    "these ensembles , characterized by bi - partite interaction , are closer related to various physical models of interacting spins .",
    "analysis of spectral properties of random states defined in a the latter procedure is a subject of a following publication .",
    "observe that for any cycle graph , in which each vertex has exactly two bonds , both definitions yield exactly the same ensembles of random pure states .",
    "we conclude the paper with a rather general remark .",
    "although the approach presented in this work is not directly related to any concrete hamiltonian model of the physical interaction , it is capable to describe generic coupling between the subsystems . not knowing any details about the kind of the interaction one assumes therefore that it can be mimicked by a random unitary matrix .",
    "averaging over the haar measure on the unitary group we obtain rigorous bounds for the average entropy of entanglement between any two specified fragments of the system . in the limit of large system size",
    "the bounds derived become exact , and are characteristic of generalized ensembles of random wishart matrices .",
    "the results obtained for the average entropy are universal in the sense that they depend on the topology of the graph and its partition , but do not depend on the kind of the interaction between subsystems . establishing a direct link between the results obtained in this work and the properties of typical matrix product states analyzed for concrete physical models @xcite remains as a subject of further investigations .",
