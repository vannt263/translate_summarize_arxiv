    "the interference of light scattered by different particles of an ensemble is at the origin of a variety of collective phenomena such as superradiance  @xcite , bragg scattering or collective frequency shifts  @xcite .",
    "the phenomena can be classified in two distinct regimes according to whether the scatterers interact with each other via mediation of the incident light , or not .",
    "bragg scattering , for example , is the result of a far - field interference of the light waves scattered by an optically dilute , periodic structure . in this case , even in the absence of communication between the scatterers , the radiated light pattern provides information on the scattering structure , a fact that is extensively used , e.g .  in crystallography . on the other hand ,",
    "optically dense structures lead to multiple scattering and strong interference in the near - field ( i.e.  within the structure ) between the light waves scattered from different particles .",
    "one example is the opening of photonic band gaps in period structures  @xcite .",
    "cold atomic clouds are particularly attractive experimentation platforms as powerful techniques not only allow to shape the density distribution but also to fine - tune the light - matter interaction over wide ranges . here",
    "we show that sufficiently cold atomic clouds exposed to a gradient of the strength of the light - matter interaction deflect light due to collective scattering in the single - scattering regime .",
    "we propose to implement the required gradient by an inhomogeneous magnetic field exploiting the zeeman effect .",
    "because this phenomenon is reminiscent of an effect studied in nuclear physics called `` lighthouse effect ''  @xcite , we call this effect the `` atomic lighthouse effect '' .",
    "the nuclear lighthouse effect was used to perform spectroscopy and the transformation from time to angular coordinates allowed to detect timescales difficult to achieve with present detection schemes .",
    "similar light deviation effects have been experimentally observed for light passing through an atomic vapour in slow light and electromagnetically induced transparency schemes using either magnetically  @xcite or optically induced gradients  @xcite .",
    "we will show in this paper that the atomic lighthouse effect can be obtained on a two level scheme and is a result of the interference of the light radiated by independent atoms . similarly to bragg scattering , it is thus fully determined by the single - photon structure factor of the atomic cloud .",
    "however , light - induced interatomic cooperation dramatically _ alters _ the lighthouse effect in the case of optically dense samples . we prove this via calculations and simulations accounting for the light - induced interactions between the atoms in the multiple scattering regime .",
    "the alteration can be understood as an increase in the atomic linewidth , due to the atoms cooperation , that reduces the zeeman effect .",
    "hence , the lighthouse reduction provides a direct signature of cooperativity .",
    "we describe the light deviation by a cloud of atoms with a model treating all atomic dipoles as being coupled via the incident light .",
    "this allows us to account for interferences between these dipoles in the optically dense regime .",
    "photon random walk approaches are not sufficient . furthermore",
    ", all dipoles are exposed to a locally varying atom - light interaction inducing an inhomogeneous phase profile of the dipole excitation across the atomic cloud .",
    "let us start by considering an ensemble of @xmath0 two - level ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) atoms , each at a position @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , driven by a uniform laser beam with wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "the detuning of the light from the atomic resonance is @xmath6 , and the rabi frequency is @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the dipole matrix element , @xmath9 the field amplitude and @xmath10 the planck constant .",
    "the atom - light interaction is locally tuned with a inhomogeneous magnetic field in the quantization direction @xmath11 ( see fig.[fig : setup ] ) .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider an electronic transition with a structureless ground state and single excited state zeeman level .",
    "this system is described by the following hamiltonian  @xcite in the rotating wave approximation @xmath12 @xmath13 is the detuning between the field emitted into mode @xmath14 and the atomic transition @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the single - photon rabi frequency for a photon volume @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 describes the ( inhomogeneous ) zeeman effect , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the pauli matrices describing the de - excitation and the excited state population of atom @xmath21 , whereas @xmath22 describes the photon annihilation in the mode @xmath14 .",
    "( color online ) scheme of the atomic lighthouse effect : an incident laser beam labeled by its wave vector @xmath23 , is scattered from a cloud of cold atoms to which a transverse magnetic field gradient , @xmath24 , is applied . as a consequence",

    "since the laser detuning @xmath29 is equivalent to a magnetic field offset , we may set @xmath30 without loss of generality  .",
    "as the lighthouse effect relies on a global phase contrast in the dipole field rather than on disorder effects , we adopt a fluid description of the system introducing the local density @xmath31 and dipole field @xmath32 .",
    "then , in the steady state regime , eq .   turns into a fredholm equation of the second type @xmath33 where we have introduced the single - scattering dipole excitation @xmath34 and the scattering kernel @xmath35 the consequence of a differential zeeman effect is intuitive in the single - scattering limit  ( [ eq : ss ] ) , where the field @xmath36 modulates spatially the phase ( and amplitude ) of the dipole field , thus modifying the direction of superradiant emission of the cloud . in the multiple scattering regime",
    ", a more detailed study must be performed in order to understand how the rescattering of the photons alters this new phase profile ( see sec .",

    "we found the lighthouse effect to be strongest is this geometry .",
    "indeed , for a central detuning @xmath38 much larger than the one created by the gradient of magnetic field @xmath39 ( @xmath40 the cloud radius ) , the resulting gradient of phase is tuned down by a factor @xmath41 , thus reducing the deflection angle .",

    "this observation points to the fact that the lighthouse deflection is clearly not a cooperative effect in the sense that it does not result from light - mediated interaction of the atoms .",
    "it is rather similar to bragg scattering , where the scattering pattern generated by interference of the radiated waves provides information on the atomic cloud s structure .",
    "as soon as the atoms interact through their radiation , the emergence of multiple scattering washes out the phase gradient imposed externally by the magnetic field .",
    "our predictions can be experimentally verified , e.g.  with a cloud of spatially confined cold atoms exposed to a uniform magnetic field gradient .",

    "note that the strong background radiation is due to the limited number of particles that can be simulated .",
    "the reduced radiated intensity in presence of the gradient of magnetic field is due to the fact that many atoms are driven out of resonance by it , so their coupling with the light is reduced .",
