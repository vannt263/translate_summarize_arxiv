    "in the context of microfluidics , wetting phenomena at the micro- and nano - meter scale @xcite are relevant for applications like microreactors or chemical sensors , for which a crucial challenge is the transport of liquid to networks of channels or chemical lanes , as well as its precise manipulation within such a network @xcite .",
    "since at this small scale the liquid - substrate interaction is important , the flow of thin films may be eventually controlled by engineering the physico - chemical properties of the substrate , thus opening the road for applications which do not have an equivalent at the macroscopic scale @xcite .",
    "although the existence of very thin precursor films has been long ago evidenced by the studies of hardy @xcite , only recent experiments on liquid spreading on atomically smooth surfaces @xcite , performed with volumes of the order of nano - liters , have clearly shown by means of dynamic ellipsometry or x - ray reflectivity measurements that one or few precursor films with _ molecular thickness _ and",
    "_ macroscopic extent _ advance in front of the macroscopic liquid wedge of the spreading drop . the liquids used were low - molecular - mass polymer oils which behave as non - volatile liquids , and experiments performed both for spreading of nano - droplets and for capillary rise geometries have established that the linear extent @xmath1 of the precursor film grows in time as @xmath6 .",
    "the exponent @xmath7 seems to be independent of the nature of the liquid and of the substrate , of the geometry , and of the volume of droplet as long as the droplet is not emptied and constitutes a reservoir for the extracting film ; only the prefactor @xmath3 depends on these parameters .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed ( see refs . @xcite and",
    "references therein ) and an impressive number of molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) numerical simulations have been performed ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) in order to understand the mechanisms behind the extraction of precursor films and to explain the time dependence of the spreading .    the hydrodynamic model of de gennes and cazabat @xcite assumes a layered structure of the droplet , each layer being a two - dimensional incompressible fluid , in which vertical transport is possible only at the edges of the layers .",
    "the model leads to the correct time dependence for the advancing layers , but , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , it is debatable if this hydrodynamic description holds at the molecular level and can be directly applied to ultra - thin films .",
    "a different approach , along the line of earlier work on activated kinetics by cherry , holmes , blake , and haynes @xcite , consists of a microscopic description for the thin liquid films in terms of lattice gas models for interacting particles .",
    "one such model is the two - dimensional driven ising model recently proposed by abraham _",
    "_ @xcite . using kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations",
    "it was shown that in this model the transport of mass occurs via a second layer , and a particle - hole diffusion equation was used to show that the model leads to correct predictions ( confirmed also by simulations ) for the time dependence of spreading .",
    "the model predicts a uniform density and a compact first monolayer , in close resemblance of the incompressible layers of the hydrodynamical model mentioned before .    for the case that the precursor consists of a single monolayer , a lattice gas model of interacting particles has been proposed by burlatsky _",
    "this model , which allows mass transport from the reservoir to the advancing edge only inside the monolayer , has been extended to the more general situation of relaxation of a monolayer initially occupying a half - plane without a reservoir by oshanin _",
    "_ @xcite . based on several mean - field assumptions ,",
    "among which the strongest is the replacement of the inter - particles attraction in the `` bulk '' by an `` effective force '' acting on the advancing edge , the authors have been able to derive the @xmath8-law for the spreading and to calculate the dependence of the prefactor on the fluid - fluid interaction parameters .",
    "in contrast to the other two models , in this case the density in the monolayer depends significantly on the distance from the reservoir .",
    "although it is reasonable to expect that neglecting the attractive particle - particle interactions in the `` bulk '' should not affect the time dependence @xmath9 , one can expect that the behavior in the presence of attractive interactions is much richer ( see , for example , the recent kmc simulations results of lacasta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a closely related one - dimensional model ) .",
    "all three models mentioned above recover the correct time - dependence of spreading , but it is unlikely that one can discriminate between them via experimental tests based on their predictions for the corresponding prefactors because these include in each case a number of parameters whose connections with experimental quantities are not clear .",
    "however , we have already pointed out that these models lead to qualitatively different predictions with respect to the shape of the emerging density profiles ( constant in the first two cases , spatially varying in the last ) which are , in principle , experimentally accessible .    in this work",
    "we analyze in detail the density profiles of this last model .",
    "we present results of kmc simulations on a square lattice of a model for spreading of a liquid monolayer closely related to the model in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "our choice for kmc simulations of a lattice gas model is motivated by the fact that we are interested in the asymptotic ( large spatial and temporal scales ) behavior , a regime which as yet can not be explored using molecular dynamics simulations because of extensive computing resources needed to simulate spatially large systems and unreasonable large cpu times required to simulate real times even in the order of @xmath10-seconds .",
    "in contrast to the previous work mentioned above , we shall explicitely consider the asymmetry of the jump rates in the bulk , at the expense of being able to measure the prefactor @xmath3 from the simulations but not to predict it analytically .",
    "our results show a non - trivial dependence of the prefactor @xmath3 on the strength @xmath4 of the inter - particle attraction and on the density @xmath5 at the reservoir . the asymptotic spreading behavior at long time and large spatial scale of the transversally averaged density profile is analyzed within a continuum limit .",
    "we show that the model predicts qualitatively different structures for the experimentally accessible density profiles along the spreading direction above and below a threshold value for the ratio between the fluid - fluid interaction and the thermal energy .",
    "including the effect of correlations in an effective manner into the standard mean - field description , we find excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and the kmc results .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary and discussion of the results .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a simple microscopic model for the dynamics of a fluid monolayer in contact with a reservoir was proposed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although we use here this lattice gas model of interacting particles with only slight modifications , for clarity and further reference we describe , motivate , and comment on the defining rules as follows .",
    "+ * ( a ) * the spreading geometry is rectangular ( @xmath11 plane ) and the substrate is homogeneous .",
    "the half - plane @xmath12 is occupied by a reservoir of particles ( three - dimensional bulk liquid ) at fixed chemical potential which maintains at its contact line with the substrate , positioned at the line @xmath13 , an _",
    "density @xmath5 ( defined as number of particles per unit length in the transversal @xmath14 direction ) . for the case of capillary rise",
    ", the reservoir would correspond to the liquid bath and the line @xmath15 to the edge of the macroscopic meniscus .",
    "it is assumed that the only role of the reservoir is to maintain @xmath5 constant , and thus to feed the monolayer which is extracted , but there is no flow of particles from the reservoir to `` push '' the film .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is expected to be related to the difference in the free energy per particle @xmath16 between a fluid particle in bulk liquid , i.e. , inside the three - dimensional reservoir , and one on the surface of the substrate at @xmath15 , and thus it is a measure of the wettability of the substrate by the liquid @xcite .",
    "a general , explicit form for the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath16 is not available , but for a qualitative picture @xcite an argument based on langmuir - type adsorption may be used to estimate @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the area per adsorption site and @xmath19 is the density ( number of particles per unit volume ) in the reservoir . at time @xmath20 , the half - plane @xmath21 is empty .",
    "+ * ( b ) * the substrate - fluid interaction is modeled as a periodic potential forming a lattice of potential wells with coordination number @xmath22 and lattice constant @xmath23 .",
    "the particle motion proceeds via activated jumps between nearest - neighbor wells ; evaporation from the substrate is not allowed .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the activated jumps can be described by the classical reaction - rate theory , i.e. , the activation barrier @xmath24 is significantly larger than the thermal energy @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath27 the temperature , and the coupling to the substrate is large enough such that in crossing the barrier all the kinetic energy of the particle is dissipated @xcite . the barrier @xmath24 determines the jumping rate @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 is an attempt frequency defining the time unit .",
    "we note that for a two - dimensional homogeneous , isotropic substrate and a regular ( square , triangular , honeycomb , etc . )",
    "lattice structure , this jumping rate can be absorbed into the one - particle diffusion coefficient @xmath30 on the bare substrate @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath24 is an irrelevant parameter in the sense that it can be incorporated either into the choice of the unit of time as @xmath31 or into that of the unit of length as @xmath32 . for the rest of this work we consider a square lattice ( @xmath33 ) ; a qualitatively significant dependence of the results on the lattice type is not expected .",
    "this expectation is based on corresponding results obtained from test simulations on a triangular lattice ( @xmath34 ) . + * ( c ) * the pair interaction between fluid particles at distance @xmath35 is taken to be hard - core repulsive at short range , preventing double occupancy of the wells , and attractive at long range , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , resembling a lennard - jones type interaction potential . here and in the following @xmath35 is measured in units of @xmath23 so that @xmath4 denotes the strength of the interaction energy .",
    "the absence of double occupancy leads to an _ a priori _ removal of thickening of the film as a possible relaxation mechanism , which is not meant to imply that we consider it irrelevant .",
    "we have decided to disregard this mechanism here since it would have significantly increased the complexity of the problem .",
    "thus we leave the issue of film thickening open for further research . + *",

    "the selection of the nearest - neighbor well , i.e. , the probability @xmath38 that a jump from location @xmath39 will be directed toward the location @xmath40 , is biased by the fluid - fluid energy landscape and is given by @xmath41\\bigr\\ } } { z(\\bm{r};t ) } , \\label{prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath42\\biggr\\ } } $ ] is the normalization constant and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the occupation number of the well at @xmath40 at the time @xmath2 .",

    "we also note that the summation in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) has been restricted to three lattice units for computational convenience .",
    "this corresponds to the cut - off generally used in molecular dynamics simulations for algebraically decaying lennard - jones pair - potentials .",
    "the expression eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) for the probability that a certain direction is chosen for jumping deserves further discussion . for a particle located at @xmath39",

( [ prob ] ) ) that the rates @xmath48 for the transitions from @xmath39 to neighboring locations @xmath40 satisfy @xmath49 thus the total rate of leaving a location for any given particle at any given location is determined only by the fluid - solid interaction characterized by @xmath24 , it is time - independent , and it equals @xmath50 . therefore , the fluid - fluid interaction will influence _ only _ the choice of a _ direction _ for the jump , but not the jumping frequency , and in the dynamics there will be only one relevant microscopic time scale , @xmath31 , which is dictated by the solid - fluid coupling .",
    "the choice @xmath51\\bigr\\ } $ ] is motivated by the following .",
    "if one disregards the reservoir and considers a system with a given volume and a given number of particles , the change in the total fluid - fluid energy ( no double occupancy ) @xmath52 due to a change in configuration @xmath53 where @xmath54 , is given by @xmath55 , with @xmath56 calculated for the final configuration and @xmath57 for the initial one .",

( [ rate_ff ] ) ) by the ( local ) total transition rate @xmath62 , a decoupling results between an activated dynamics determined by the solid - fluid interaction and a weak perturbation due to the fluid - fluid interaction , and the choice given in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) for the bias probability @xmath38 is obtained .",
    "one should note that this decoupling is obtained at the expense that the transition rates @xmath63 defined by eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) do not satisfy detailed balance with respect to the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) , although the deviations , which are equal to @xmath64 due to @xmath65 are expected to be very small . from this point of view , the dynamics defined by eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) is that of an asymmetric exclusion process @xcite , but with a position- and time - dependent bias . + * ( e ) * as defined by the rules * ( a)-(d ) * , the model corresponds to mass transport from the reservoir into a two - dimensional vacuum so that a phase with very low - density , due to two - dimensional evaporation , will form in front of the advancing monolayer .",
    "the emergence of this low - density phase poses problems in that its long time dynamics , which is of ideal gas type , mixes with that of the following - up `` compact '' film and leads to serious difficulties in defining the advancing edge of the monolayer .",
    "this problem has been encountered earlier also in three - dimensional simulations @xcite and , in general , it has been overcome by replacing the simple particles by connected chains mimicking polymers .",
    "although this approach is straightforward it is not very appealing , neither from a theoretical point of view ( an analytical approach becomes at least cumbersome , if not intractable ) , nor from a computational one ( the memory and cpu requirements for sufficiently long simulation runs for large enough systems are unreasonably high ) .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a different approach .",
    "we define the advancing edge @xmath66 of a monolayer configuration at time @xmath2 as the set of the most advanced particles in each line @xmath67 for this configuration ( see fig .",

    "there are periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath70direction . ]",
    "we eliminate two - dimensional `` evaporation '' by imposing the following additional constraint : moves from sites @xmath71 toward sites @xmath40 ahead of @xmath66 for which @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a fixed threshold value , are rejected .",
    "this corresponds to requiring a given minimum number of particles in the neighborhood @xmath74 of any of the components of @xmath66 .",
    "the results presented in this paper correspond to simulations with @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath76 , in other words to the requirement that in the disk @xmath77 centered at @xmath40 there is at least one more particle in addition to the one attempting the jump @xmath78 ( see also , c.f . , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the above constraint is close in spirit to the `` effective boundary - tension '' idea used in ref .",

    "rule * ( e ) * provides a simple and convenient way of controlling the rate of two - dimensional evaporation .",
    "for example , setting @xmath79 corresponds to fully unconstrained dynamics , while replacing the rejection procedure with an `` acceptance rate '' will allow for a continuous tuning of the evaporation rate through the acceptance rate .",
    "we note that , physically , the model defined by the rules * ( a)-(e ) * could be used to study also expansion into an already present vapor phase instead of expansion into vacuum . in the presence of a vapor phase",
    "there would be an average occupancy of the sites in front of @xmath66 , and thus some of the jumps from @xmath66 would be rejected due to the hard - core repulsion , which is an effect similar to an acceptance rate as discussed above .",

    "[ fig6 ] ) .",

    "[ fig6](d ) ) , one observes deviations from scaling in the range of densities @xmath217 .",

    "[ fig6 ] are good approximations for the corresponding scaling function @xmath218 .",
    "the scaled density profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] reveal three important features .",
    "first , we have already noted that the change in shape of the function @xmath187 as @xmath129 crosses @xmath178 signals a change in the spreading behavior . as shown by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , for large @xmath129 the monolayer has an almost compact structure , and at the advancing edge there is a sharp transition from a large density to a small , almost zero , density .",
    "therefore , in this range of interaction the spreading is accompanied by the emergence of a well defined interface between two phases .",
    "in contrast , at small @xmath129 the density decreases smoothly from the value at the edge of the reservoir to zero and no jump in the density is visible .",
    "thus @xmath177 is a threshold value above which the attractive interaction is strong enough to support the build - up of an interface . in this sense",
    ", the change at @xmath177 may be interpreted as the onset of a phase separation .",
    "the second point regards the shape of the density profile as a function of the parameter @xmath5 . for a weak attractive interaction @xmath129 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) ) or at small densities @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) ) , the density profiles resemble well the error function solution of a regular diffusion equation for non - interacting particles @xcite .",
    "as we shall show in the next section , in this range such a description is not only qualitatively but even quantitatively accurate .",
    "however , for larger values @xmath129 ( but still below @xmath177 ) and for large @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ) , one finds the formation of a pronounced shoulder in the scaling function in the range of small @xmath219 ( i.e. , @xmath220 ) , and thus a significant deviation from an error function solution .",
    "this shows that in this range of parameters the asymmetry in the jumping probabilities due to the attractive interaction between particles can not be fully accounted for by an effective boundary force approach as in ref .",
    "therefore one has to include explicitly this asymmetry into the description of the dynamics in order to accurately capture the structure of the expanding film .",
    "finally , interaction strengths above @xmath177 have dramatic effects on the spreading behavior , leading to the emergence of interfaces ( fig .  [ fig6](b ) ) , and the simple description in terms of non - interacting particles breaks down completely .",
    "the third feature of the profiles to be discussed is the formation of a `` foot '' at the right end of the profile .",
    "the height of the foot is approximately equal to @xmath189 and this is due to the fact that the density value on an _ advancing _ edge @xmath66 can not decrease below @xmath189 .",
    "the formation of the step implies that the fluctuations of the interface @xmath66 around the mean value @xmath1 are constant or increase in time slower than @xmath146 , such that the width of the interface divided by @xmath134 vanishes in the long time limit .",
    "this sharp interface is occurring naturally due to the fact that the eventually large fluctuations are suppressed by blocking the advancing of isolated particles ahead of the film ( see rule * ( e ) * in sect .",
    "ii ) , and thus the width of the interface would be expected to be of the order of the cut - off @xmath76 of the attractive potential and to be almost constant in time . although the formation of the `` foot '' is a somewhat artificial feature introduced in the model by rule * ( e ) * , the advantage of it is , as discussed in the introduction , that it leads to the clear formation of an interface with its associated dynamics .",
    "neglecting all spatial and temporal correlations , i.e. , assuming that averages of products of occupation numbers @xmath221 are equal to the corresponding products of averaged occupation numbers @xmath222 , where @xmath223 denotes the average with respect to the corresponding probability distribution @xmath224 of a configuration @xmath68 , one can formulate the following mean - field master equation for the local occupational probability ( density ) @xmath112 : @xmath225 } & \\nonumber \\\\ & { \\displaystyle \\hspace*{.4in}+[1-\\rho(\\bm{r};t ) ] \\sum_{\\bm{r'},|\\bm{r'}-\\bm{r}|=1 } \\omega_{\\bm{r ' } \\to \\bm{r};t } \\rho(\\bm{r'};t)\\,\\ , , } & \\label{master_rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath226 is replacing @xmath57 in the definition for @xmath227 ( eq .",

    "the only lattice gas system with long - ranged interactions for which it has been rigorously shown that eq .",
    "( [ pde_rho ] ) represents the correct continuum limit at all temperatures is the hard - core lattice gas model with a hamiltonian composed of short - ranged ( on - site ) repulsion and long- ( infinite ) ranged kac potentials evolving via rates which satisfy detailed balance @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the solutions of such continuum equations compare fairly well with results of corresponding kinetic monte carlo simulations in cases where the interaction range is greater than several lattice units .",
    "typical values are 5 - 10 lattice units , depending on the dimensionality of the problem , the type of potential , and the type of dynamics defined by the microscopic rates .",
    "moreover , it has been shown by leung @xcite that heuristic derivations , based on formal taylor expansions , of continuum equations from microscopic dynamics give very good results both for the dynamics of ising models with nearest neighbor interactions and kawasaki rates and for that of driven lattice gases . based on these results",

    "( [ pde_rho ] ) is at least a good approximation for the the continuum limit of our system , although it was not rigorously derived and although the range of the attractive potential in our problem is rather short ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "( [ rate ] ) are small and do not carry over to the macroscopic scale .",

    "@xcite and @xcite would have to be modified in order to have straight instead of circular spreading geometries and a deposit - substrate combination chosen such as to avoid surface alloying effects .    as noted in the introduction the experiments with fluids performed",
    "so far deal with polymer oils .",
    "as long as the entanglement of the polymer chains is not important , one may consider a coarse - grained description in which the chain is replaced by an effective particle of the size of the corresponding radius of gyration and only the motion of the center of mass is considered .",
    "although the motion of these effective particles might not resemble simple , activated jumping processes so that the microscopic model description is not directly applicable , it is reasonable to expect that the macroscopic evolution will be diffusive .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the continuum limit of the present model can be used to describe the spreading behavior observed in experiments with polymer oils , but the macroscopic parameters entering into the diffusion equation should be regarded as fit parameters and not quantities calculated from microscopic dynamics as considered here .    in order to obtain a direct , quantitative test of the present theoretical predictions for precursor liquid films , new experiments would have to be performed using simple liquids chosen such that they have a spreading rate large compared with the evaporation rate .",
    "this should be combined with observation techniques chosen such that the density profiles , and not only the spreading rate , could be measured , which would require an in plane ( lateral ) resolution in the order of few nm for the case of simple liquids , i.e. , several lattice constants , and in the order of 10 - 50 nm for the case of polymer oils , i.e. , several inter-``effective '' particles distances , because the density variations are expected to occur on larger length scales .",
    "one technique which possibly may fulfill these requirements is reflection interference contrast microscopy @xcite , assuming that the microscope objective may scan the area of interest ( of the order of @xmath357 ) in times sufficiently small compared to those on which the density profile changes .",
    "the technique has been used before in studies of ( equilibrium ) wetting properties on micropatterned solid surfaces @xcite , and already at the time of its first implementation a lateral resolution of at least 200 nm ( see fig .",
