    "<S> we describe non - flat standard friedmann cosmology of canonical scalar field with barotropic fluid in form of non - linear schrdinger - type ( nls ) formulation in which all cosmological dynamical quantities are expressed in term of schrdinger quantities as similar to those in time - independent quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the expansion to be superfast , i.e. phantom expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we report all schrdinger - analogous quantities to scalar field cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> effective equation of state coefficient is analyzed and illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in a non - flat universe , there is no fixed @xmath0 value for the phantom divide . in a non - flat universe , even @xmath1 , the expansion can be phantom . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in open universe , phantom expansion can happen even with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also report scalar field exact solutions within frameworks of the friedmann formulation and the nls formulation in non - flat universe cases . </S>"
