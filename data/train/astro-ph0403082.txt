    "the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) provides a flexible and general method to calculate scattering and absorption of light by objects of arbitrary geometry @xcite .",
    "the approximation consists of replacing the continuum target of interest by an array of polarizable points , which acquire oscillating electric dipole moments in response to the electric field due to the incident wave plus all of the other dipoles . broadly speaking , there are two criteria determining the accuracy of the approximation :    * the interdipole separation @xmath1 should be small compared to the wavelength of the radiation in the material ( @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the complex refractive index , and @xmath3 is the wavenumber _ in vacuo _ ) ;",
    "* the interdipole separation @xmath1 should be small enough to resolve structural dimensions in the target .    with modern workstations , it is now feasible to carry out dda calculations on targets containing up to @xmath4 dipoles @xcite .",
    "in addition to calculation of scattering and absorption cross sections , the dda has recently been applied to computation of forces and torques on illuminated particles @xcite    if the dipoles are located on a cubic lattice , then in the limit where the interdipole separation @xmath5 , the familiar clausius - mossotti relation ( see , e.g , @xcite ) can be used to determine the choice of dipole polarizabilities required so that the dipole array will approximate a continuum target with dielectric constant @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite showed how this estimate for the dipole polarizabilities should be modified to include radiative reaction corrections , and @xcite derived the @xmath7 $ ] corrections required so that an infinite cubic lattice would have the same dispersion relation as a continuum of given dielectric constant .",
    "nearly all dda calculations to date have assumed the dipoles to be located on a cubic lattice .",
    "if , instead , a rectangular lattice is used , it will still be possible to apply fft techniques to the discrete dipole approximation , in essentially the same way as has been done for a cubic lattice @xcite",
    ". however , the ability to use different lattice constants in different directions might be useful in representing certain target geometries .",
    "the objective of the present report is to obtain the dispersion relation for propagation of electromagnetic waves on a rectangular lattice of polarizable points .",

    ", this will allow us to determine the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves propagating on the lattice when @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , if we require the lattice to propagate waves with a particular dispersion relation , inversion of the lattice dispersion relation will provide a prescription for assigning dipole polarizabilities when seeking to approximate a continuum material with a rectangular lattice of polarizable points .",
