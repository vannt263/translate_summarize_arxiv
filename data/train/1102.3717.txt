    "understanding how momentum is distributed within a tokamak is crucial to explaining experimentally observed regions of reduced turbulent transport like internal transport barriers ( itbs ) @xcite and edge pedestals @xcite . in these regions of reduced transport ,",
    "turbulence is suppressed by strong velocity gradients , which are determined by the transport of toroidal angular momentum .",
    "nonlinear @xmath0 flux tube simulations @xcite are extensively used to study turbulent transport of toroidal angular momentum in tokamaks @xcite .",
    "the time averaged turbulent transport of momentum is found to be zero for up - down symmetric tokamaks in the absence of toroidal velocity and toroidal velocity gradient .",
    "this behavior was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the transport of parallel momentum due to electrostatic fluctuations was studied with a quasilinear model . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the linearized gyrokinetic equation has a symmetry that results in the transport of parallel momentum vanishing for up - down symmetric tokamaks in the absence of velocity and velocity shear .",
    "moreover , this analysis was successfully employed to identify the up - down asymmetry as a drive for momentum transport @xcite .    however , there are six major effects that were not treated in the analysis of ref .",
    "first , the symmetry given in ref .",
    "@xcite is only valid for the linearized equation .",
    "second , the formulation was collisionless .",
    "third , the effect of the @xmath1 shear on transport of momentum @xcite was not considered .",
    "fourth , the mach number was assumed to be small and the effect of the centrifugal force @xcite was neglected .",
    "fifth , in the evaluation of the radial transport of toroidal angular momentum , the contribution of the component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field was neglected .",
    "sixth , electromagnetic effects were not taken into account . in this article , we present the complete symmetry argument .",
    "we consider the high flow regime , for which the mean velocity is comparable to the thermal speed of the ions , and we use the local approximation , for which the turbulent transport only depends on local quantities . in this limit , the sign of the radial transport of toroidal angular momentum changes under a sign change of the average velocity and its gradient and an up - down reflection .",
    "thus , for an up - down symmetric tokamak without any velocity or velocity shear , the momentum transport is zero .",
    "the symmetry presented here is broken if higher order terms in the gyrokinetic expansion in @xmath2 are kept , giving transport of momentum that is small in @xmath3 compared to the high flow results . here",
    "@xmath4 is the ion gyroradius and @xmath5 is the minor radius of the tokamak .",
    "the effect of these higher order terms on transport of momentum is discussed in ref .",

    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the local @xmath0 gyrokinetic model in the high flow regime in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we then show in section  [ sec : symmetry ] that the gyrokinetic equations have two fundamental symmetries that involve an up - down reflection .",
    "finally , the consequences of these symmetries for transport of momentum are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the most cumbersome parts of the calculation are given in appendices [ app : collision]-[app : updown2 ] .",
    "in this section we present the local @xmath0 gyrokinetic system of equations in the high flow ordering , for which the average velocity of the ions @xmath6 is of the order of the ion thermal speed @xmath7 .",
    "first , in subsection  [ sub : equilibrium ] , we review the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equilibrium for a tokamak and we discuss the background density , temperature and velocity .",
    "we then present in subsection  [ sub : fluctuations ] the system of equations for the fluctuating pieces of the distribution function and the electromagnetic field .",
    "these equations are simplified in the local limit in subsection  [ sub : local ] .",
