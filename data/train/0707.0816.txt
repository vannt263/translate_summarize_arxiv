    "metals are a major influence on star formation and evolution . by controlling",
    "the rate at which star - forming gas can radiatively cool , metals help determine the typical stellar mass . at one extreme of metallicity , the first stars likely had many unique properties because of their primordial composition .",
    "theoretical studies of the formation of `` population iii '' stars have converged on the clear prediction that their typical jeans mass scale was @xmath5 @xmath3  ( bromm & larson 2004 ) because primordial gas with @xmath6 k was restricted to inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen formed by slow gas - phase reactions in the absence of dust .",
    "this expectation has now been verified with high - fidelity numerical simulations that track pre - stellar evolution until formation of a dense molecular protostellar core ( abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 , 2002 ; omukai et al .",
    "2005 ; oshea et al .",

    "while radiative feedback during collapse to the main sequence may limit the final mass ( tan & mckee 2004 ) , massive stars are still expected .",
    "the transition from massive primordial stars to the first low - mass stars is of great interest for understanding the formation of the first galaxies and of the milky way .",
    "the concept of a unique cooling regime leading to massive stars at low metallicity contrasted with the prevalence of low - mass stars ( lms ) in the modern universe implies that metallicity plays an important role in establishing the conditions for low - mass star formation . though there need",
    "not be a single - valued metallicity criterion for lms formation , such a sharp `` critical metallicity '' , @xmath7 , can be calculated for typical interstellar conditions and used to inform more detailed models .",
    "bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) estimated @xmath8 @xmath9 accounting for only the dominant cooling lines of c and o. schneider et al .",
    "( 2002 ) included the cooling effects of dust formed in sne from primordial stars and found @xmath10 .",
    "santoro & shull ( 2006 ) studied detailed thermodynamic trajectories and more realistic mixtures of relative abundances , and found the critical metallicity to be a function of gas density with characteristic values @xmath11 . finally , detailed work on metallicity - dependent cooling and star formation by omukai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and smith & sigurdsson ( 2007 ) has suggested that there may be a more gradual evolution , with a possibly bimodal distribution near the transitional metallicity owing to the varying influence of the global thermal environment ( larson 2005 ) .",
    "thus the theoretical picture of the variation of the imf with metallicity is somewhat unclear and more observational information is needed .",
    "recent efforts to understand the formation of stars and galaxies in the early universe using local , long - lived signatures , an approach termed `` near - field cosmology '' ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) , have begun to bring insight into the nature of the early stellar generations . coordinated observing campaigns to discover and study the most metal - poor stars have revealed large samples of stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath12 and abundance patterns that change in character from higher metallicity ( beers & christlieb 2005 ) .",
    "attempts to turn these high - quality abundance data on metal - poor stars into empirical limits on the primordial imf have favored stars with @xmath13 @xmath3  as the progenitors of the metals in these presumably second - generation stars ( umeda & nomoto 2003 , 2005 ; tumlinson , venkatesan , & shull 2004 ; tumlinson 2006 , hereafter t06 ) .",
    "this chemical evidence is presently the sole observational test of theoretical models for primordial star formation .",
    "the data is in broad agreement with the theoretical expectations for massive stars ; more detailed theoretical calculations are needed to better understand the role of feedback ( and metals ) in limiting the final stellar mass . because these chemical signatures are borne by lms , the conditions under which they form is of fundamental importance to their discovery and interpretation .",
    "it is therefore important to pursue empirical tests of the imf at the lowest metallicities to study the implications of low metal abundance on the star formation process .",
    "unfortunately the known populations of metal - poor stars are not yet large enough to determine the critical metallicity empirically ( t06 ; salvadori , schneider , & ferrara 2007 ) , and the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) shows no feature that indicates a sharp increase in the relative incidence of low - mass stars .    the two most iron - poor stars , he0107 - 5240 with [ fe / h ]  = @xmath14 ( christlieb et al . 2002 , 2004 ; bessell et al .",
    "2004 ) and he1327 - 2326 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath15 ( frebel et al . 2005 ; aoki et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter af06 ) are a surprising development in the ongoing study of ancient stellar `` fossils '' , because of their conspicuous presence beyond an apparent gap in the halo metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) and their extreme relative enrichments of light elements , [ c / fe ] @xmath16 and [ c / h ] @xmath17 . their implications for lms formation at low metallicity hinge on the interpretation of these enhancements :",
    "if their surface abundances exist throughout the entire mass of the star , they would support the view that it is carbon that sets @xmath7 and that lms formation is inhibited below [ c / h ] @xmath18 ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; frebel , johnson , & bromm 2007 ) .",
    "however , the hmps may have formed with total metallicity @xmath19 and acquired surface c enhancement later by , e.g. accretion and/or internal enrichment .",
    "if so , these stars imply that lms star formation was possible , if rare , at that extremely low metal abundance .",
    "this paper uses the comprehensive observational information now known about the two hyper - metal - poor stars ( hmps ; [ fe / h ]  @xmath20 , in the terminology of beers & christlieb 2005 ) to test models for their origin and to draw implications from each model for the imf at low metallicity .",
    "=    section 2 of this paper describes the key observed features of the known hmps .",
    "section 3 reviews and critiques the three main hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the origin of the hmps , and argues that a binary origin followed by mass transfer from an agb companion best fits the available data .",
    "section 4 pursues the implications of this finding for the mass function of stars at low metallicity .",
    "section 5 summarizes the conclusions and comments on related issues .",
    "since the discovery of he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 substantial effort has gone into studying their spectra at high resolution , into modeling their atmospheres to deduce abundances , and into theoretical explanations of their origin .",
    "this section briefly reviews the major observed features of these stars before evaluating the theoretical explanations against these data (   3 ) .",
    "af06 also provide a thorough review of the abundance patterns of he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 from a more detailed observational point of view .",
    "a summary view of the abundances in the two hmps is shown in figure  [ hmp - abund - fig ] , together with model abundance patterns for the hypothetical origins discussed in   3 .",
    "the two abundance patterns are similar in their gross features , but also differ significantly in important elements .",
    "the most notable features of the hmp stars are the strong enhancements of the light elements c , n , and o in both stars , and the enhancement of na , mg , and al in he1327 - 2326 .",
    "af06 report [ c , n , o / fe ] = @xmath21 for he1327 - 2326 , along with [ na , mg , al / fe ] = @xmath22 .",
    "christlieb et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report [ c , n , o / fe ] = @xmath23 for he0107 - 5240 .",
    "these abundances are adopted here for tests of theoretical models and appear in figure  [ hmp - abund - fig ] .",
    "these abundances carry typical errors of @xmath24 dex with the larger uncertainties for the cno abundances derived from molecular absorption bands .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the observational selections that led to the discovery of the two hmps introduced a bias in favor of c - enhanced stars , or against c - normal stars .",
    "both stars were selected for spectroscopic followup from the hamburg - eso objective prism survey ( wisotzki et al .",
    "2000 ) based on the strength of their ca ii k bands , which are used as a proxy for [ fe / h ] .",
    "both stars lie in the mainstream of [ ca / fe ] for metal - poor stars in the halo ( cayrel et al .",
    "2004 ; barklem et al . 2005 ) , so there is no reason to suspect that this selection criterion preferentially selects c - rich stars .",
    "finally , the c - bearing molecular bands were not known until high - resolution spectra were obtained ( af06 ) , so there is no reason to suspect that bias was introduced during selection by the investigators .",
    "we can therefore proceed under the assumption that the two hmps are a fair representation of low - mass stars at their epoch and/or metallicity , until proven otherwise .",
    "another notable feature of he1327 - 2326 is its strong apparent depletion of lithium , @xmath25(li ) @xmath26 ( af06)(li ) @xmath27 ; see http://www.int.washington.edu / talks / workshops/. ] .",
    "this limit is well below the primordial abundance inferred for primordial gas from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis , @xmath25(li ) @xmath28 ( spergel et al .",
    "he1327 - 2326 also lies well below the modestly depleted `` spite plateau '' measured in other metal - poor stars , for which @xmath25(li ) @xmath29 is typical ( ryan et al .",
    "this upper limit indicates strong lithium depletion in the atmosphere of he1327 - 2326 , which is surprising for a dwarf or subgiant star of @xmath30 k. although the interpretation of li is complicated for the giant star he0107 - 5240 that may have depleted its own li during evolution into a giant , the status of li as a primordial element that is easily destroyed in stars can be used to constrain the possible origin scenarios for the hmps .",
    "finally , there is a clear detection of the neutron - capture element strontium ( [ sr / fe ] = 1.1 ) in he1327 - 2326 , while barium is not detected ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath31 ) .",
    "sr has multiple nucleosynthetic sources that produce sr in distinctive ratios to ba , so it is possible in principle to use the limit on the ratio of these elements , [ sr / ba ] @xmath32 , to constrain origin scenarios for he1327 - 2326 .    the main s - process associated with agb stars produces a ratio [ sr / ba ] @xmath33 ( aoki et al .",
    "2002 ; barklem et al . 2005 ) and has a strong metallicity dependence because it requires heavy seed nuclei ( travaglio et al .",
    "2004 ) , even though its neutron source reaction ( @xmath34c(@xmath35 , n)@xmath36o ) is primary .",
    "similarly , the weak s - process associated with he - burning massive stars has a strong metallicity dependence through the neutron source reaction @xmath37ne(@xmath35 , n)@xmath38 mg .",
    "the novel proton - mixing - driven mechanism proposed by goriely & siess ( 2001 ) yields a broad range of s - process elements even for zero - metallicity stars , but its intrinsic ratio [ sr / ba ] @xmath39 is also incompatible with observed limit in he1327 - 2326 . thus the sr and ba abundances , whatever their site of production , can not be dominated by yields from the known slow neutron - capture processes .",
    "there are two neutron capture processes associated with massive stars that produce sr and ba in a ratio consistent with the limit from he1327 - 2326 . the main r - process , which is thought to be associated with explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars ( truran et al . 2002 ) , most likely of @xmath40 @xmath3  ( wanajo & ishimaru 2005 ) , yields [ sr / ba ] @xmath41 according to the solar system residuals method ( arlandini et al .",
    "the `` light element primary process '' ( lepp ) isolated to massive stars because of its clear presence at [ fe / h ]  @xmath42 ( travaglio et al .",
    "2004 ) can give [ sr / ba ] @xmath43 . the limit on [ sr / ba ]",
    "@xmath44 in he1327 - 2326 is also consistent with the ratio [ sr / ba ] @xmath45 to @xmath46 observed in stars of [ fe / h ] @xmath47 for which the main r - process apparently dominates the abundances of eu and ba ( barklem et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the observed scatter in [ sr / ba ] in this sample , across the full range of the main r and lepp values , probably arises in decoupling between the sources of the main r - process and the lepp .",
    "this scatter makes them difficult to distinguish in individual cases .",
    "the sr production that preceded he1327 - 2326 therefore could be dominated by either , or a combination , of these processes .",
    "it may even contain a small contribution from the s - process sites above , but this contribution can not dominate the observed abundances . unfortunately , the ambiguous origin of sr in stars of [ fe / h ] @xmath48 prevents decisive tests of hmp origin scenarios using this single ratio ( see   4 ) .",
    "the non - detection of sr in he0107 - 5240 , with [ sr / fe ] @xmath49 , is consistent with the high degree of scatter seen in this ratio for metal - poor stars in the heres survey ( barklem et al .",
    "2005 ) , and does not prefer a specific nucleosynthetic origin .",
    "the goal of this paper is to select from among the existing hypotheses a common origin scenario for he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 that can also account for their differences .",
    "this section examines proposed hypotheses for the origin of the two hmps , including the faint supernova hypothesis of umeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) and iwamoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the massive star winds model of meynet , ekstrm , & maeder ( 2006 ) , and the pop iii binary hypothesis of suda et al . ( 2004 ) .",
    "production of cno _ in situ _ does not appear possible for the two hmps .",
    "first , he1327 - 2326 is an unevolved star on either the main sequence or subgiant branch of the hr diagram , and there is no known mechanism for strongly enhanced primary light element enrichment in such a star .",
    "af06 state that _ in situ _ processes can not account for the n excesses of he1327 - 2326 and he0107 - 5240 .      using a sophisticated stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis code ,",
    "the tokyo group has calculated explosion models and nucleosynthetic yields for metal - free stars with a wide range of explosion energies and up - to - date physics .",
    "their general approach has been to examine the wide range of observed supernova types at low redshift , with varying energy inferred from optical spectra , and ask what abundances would be expected in metal - poor stars if the same wide variation in explosion energy , @xmath50 erg , from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , occurred in primordial stars .",
    "this approach has been fruitful , as it has provided possible explanations for the unusual trends in iron group abundances ( e.g. , cr , mn , co , zn ) in emp stars ( tominaga et al .",
    "2006 ) and also provides a novel model for the origin of he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 .",
    "this critique of the hypothesis focuses on the later paper by iwamoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who model the abundance patterns for both hmp stars .    in papers by umeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) and iwamoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the tokyo group has presented models for `` faint supernovae '' that explode with @xmath51 and undergo mixing of material across the `` mass cut '' dividing ejecta from material that falls back into the black hole . their models for",
    "he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 both have 25 @xmath3  and differ only in their explosion energies and mixing - fallback parameters . for he0107 - 5240",
    ", they propose a model with @xmath53 and for he1327 - 2326 they propose @xmath54 .",
    "from the point of view of the full range of sn energies explored in other models from the same group ( @xmath55 ) , these two explosion energies are quite similar but nevertheless reproduce the very different abundance patterns of the two hmps very well , including the significantly higher ratios of n , na , mg , and al relative to fe seen in he1327 - 2326 ( figure  [ hmp - abund - fig ] ) . their models introduce homogeneous mixing in the entire region between the compact core and the mass cut ( determined to be 6.3 and 5.8 @xmath3  for he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 , respectively , from a derived @xmath56 relation ) , followed by the ejection of all material outside the mass cut and a fraction , @xmath57 , of the material from inside the mass cut .",
    "this latter assumption , which introduces the additional free parameter @xmath57 , is necessary for the escape of heavier iron - group elements from the dense region near the core that would otherwise fall back to the remnant .",
    "thus the very different and unusual abundance patterns of the two hmps can be explained self - consistently by a single physical mechanism associated with massive stars .",
    "the faint sn hypothesis makes three specific predictions : first , that the expected continuous variation in @xmath58 and therefore in ejected fe mass causes continuous variation in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the apparent gap between the hmps and the mainstream emp stars in the halo is not consistent with this prediction , so iwamoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that `` jet - induced mixing might be responsible for constraining the distribution of the @xmath57 value '' .",
    "second , assuming that the formation of low - mass stars requires a minimum critical metallicity , @xmath7 , the faint sn model implies increasing [ c / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "this effect is seen in the available data on a few stars ( see figure  13 of af06 and frebel et al .",
    "2007 ) , but since this prediction is generic to any single - progenitor explanation for the hmps it would not uniquely favor the faint sn model .",
    "third , since variations in [ na , mg , al / fe ] are caused by variation in @xmath58 , these ratios should show a continuous distribution .",
    "unfortunately this prediction can not be tested by further observations of these two stars and must await the discovery of more hmp stars .",
    "however , substantial fine tuning of the faint sn model is required to match the observed abundances . though the progenitor mass is held fixed , the explosion energy for the two favored models differs by only 4% .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for mixing between the he convective shell and h - rich envelope must be increased by a factor of @xmath59 increase to reproduce the high n / c ratio seen in he1327 - 2326 , with no apparent external justification .",
    "the faint sn model also does not explain the presence of sr and the limit on li in he1327 - 2326 .",
    "the sr detection with [ sr / ba ] @xmath44 could be produced by a massive star with either the main r - process ( truran et al .",
    "2002 ; wanajo & ishimaru 2005 ) or the newly discovered light neutron - capture element primary process thought to be responsible for sr - y - zr in the mainstream emp halo stars ( travaglio et al . 2004 ) .",
    "though the 25 @xmath3  faint sne are possibly capable of sr nucleosynthesis , the models have not yet been extended to show that the proper conditions are realized , though the sr / ba ratio favors massive stars over s - process origin in an agb star .    the main difficulty encountered by the faint sn model is the strong depletion of li in he1327 - 2326 , @xmath25(li ) @xmath60 .",
    "this abundance lies a full decade below the wmap cosmological value of @xmath25(li ) @xmath28 ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) and substantially below the `` spite plateau '' with @xmath25(li ) @xmath61 over [ fe / h ]  @xmath62 to @xmath63 ( spite & spite 1982 ; ryan et al .",
    "the 25 @xmath3  fiducial faint sn models eject exactly 0.20 and 0.12 @xmath3  of c for he1327 - 2326 and he0107 - 5240 , respectively , so the mass of fresh gas into which the ejecta must be mixed to obtain the observed c abundance relative to h is @xmath64 @xmath3   smaller than the @xmath65 @xmath3  expected for sne with @xmath66 .",
    "the strict requirement that the ejecta of the fiducial faint supernovae mix with exactly 650 @xmath3  to match the observed [ c / h ] @xmath67 in he1327 - 2326 ( iwamoto et al . 2005 ) entails a recovery to within 4% of the primordial or plateau li abundance even after complete astration in the 25 @xmath3  progenitor .",
    "if the massive star has astrated less than the total abundance of lithium with which it formed , the diluted ejecta will lie even closer to the cosmic value , so this assumption of complete astration is a conservative one .",
    "thus , the faint sn model can not explain the observed ratios [ c / h ] , [ c / fe ] , and the limit on li simultaneously .",
    "this line of reasoning for li applies as well to the general class of models in which a ejecta from a single primordial supernova is diluted into a large reservoir of primordial gas prior to the formation of he1327 - 2326 .",
    "the faint sn hypothesis provides a reasonable , physically motivated model for the abundances in the hmps , but it can not yet explain the full range of observed properties of these stars . clearly this hypothesis can not yet be firmly excluded , but it can not be considered complete until it can explain the li depletion in he1327 - 2326 and until the degree of fine - tuning needed to make it work has been reduced . if it is eventually proven correct , and when combined with the apparent absence of c - normal stars at [ fe / h ]  @xmath68 , it would corroborate the theoretical idea that the critical metallicity is determined mainly by cooling radiation of c and o , such that @xmath69 ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; santoro & shull 2006 ; frebel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "meynet , ekstrm , & maeder 2006 , hereafter mem06 ) and karlsson ( 2006 ) have proposed that the hmp stars formed with [ fe / h ]  @xmath70 and [ c / fe ] @xmath71 and acquired their light - element enhancements prior to formation from cno - rich winds driven by rapidly rotating massive stars .",
    "mem06 construct rotating stellar models with the key assumption that the total angular momentum with which a star forms is determined by its mass , invariant with metallicity .",
    "this simple assumption leads to @xmath72 km  s@xmath73  at the surface of a 60 @xmath3  star , which rotates near breakup velocity throughout its main - sequence lifetime .",
    "deep mixing currents driven by this fast rotation bring light elements produced in the core up to the surface where fast rotation sends them off in a wind .",
    "the ejecta are extremely enhanced in cno , and according to mem06 resemble the hmps in their overall composition ( see figure  [ hmp - abund - fig ] ) .    while the case for fast stellar rotation at very low metallicities is favored on other grounds ( see chiappini et al .",
    "2006 on the ratios of n / c and n / o seen in unevolved stars of [ fe / h ]  @xmath74 ) , it appears that the specific rotating massive star models proposed by mem06 do not reproduce all the observed features of he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ hmp - abund - fig ] , the mem06 winds - only model predicts ratios of n / c and n / o that are @xmath75 dex too high to match the data for the hmps . models that include the light - element yields of the entire star ( intended to represent the yields of a supernova ) and which match [ o / fe ] by construction can improve the fit to [ c / fe ] but not [ n / fe ] ( see figure 9 of mem06 ) .    the rapidly rotating massive stars model , like the faint supernova model , has trouble meeting the strong upper limit on the abundance of li in he1327 - 2326 , @xmath25(li ) @xmath76 .",
    "the reason is that the calculated yields of light elements from the winds and sn require dilution into @xmath77 @xmath3  of primordial interstellar gas to give the observed [ fe / h ] @xmath15 and [ o / fe ] @xmath78 for he1327 - 2326 . indeed , in constructing the observed abundance ratios mem06 calculate that the mass of the total ejecta from the star , @xmath79 @xmath3 , represents less than 1 part in 4000 of the total mixing ( or dilution mass ) , from which he1327 - 2326 eventually formed . if , as in the mem06 scenario , the hmps had only one massive star progenitor , the li abundance in the diluted material from which the hmps form should have been reduced by the same ratio , 1 part in 4000 , instead of the factor of more than 5@xmath8010 that is apparent in the data .",
    "piau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have found that the lithium depletion seen in emp stars could be caused by astration in early generations of massive stars , but if so the total mass formed into stars , and therefore astrated , must be a large fraction of the material into which their ejecta are eventually mixed before formation of the low - mass second generation .",
    "this avenue appears to be closed for the mem06 model , since the progenitors of the hmps must be an individual star of zero or extremely low metallicity and with a large dilution mass .",
    "it is also difficult to see how the low li abundance and low dilution mass could be reconciled with the low fe abundance if many primordial stars have contributed .",
    "thus , the generic class of models that requires high dilution of massive star ejecta into primordial material can not account for the strong lithium depletion observed in he1327 - 2326 .",
    "this line of reasoning applies equally well to the model proposed by chieffi & limongi ( 2003 ) , in which he0107 - 5240 arose from two primordial sne that mixed their ejecta together before forming he0107 - 5240 .",
    "the binary mass - transfer hypothesis proposes that the hmp stars acquired their light element enhancements only at their surfaces from a companion that passed through an agb phase .",

    ", this discussion has been limited to considering the origin scenarios one at a time , and not in combination .",
    "clearly , the faint sn and massive star winds models can not match the available data on their own , but it is possible in principle that the cno enhancements in the hmps were acquired from one of the first two mechanisms and the li depletion was caused by a later binary mass transfer event .",
    "in such a picture , c - rich ejecta from massive star winds or faint supernovae enriched the general ism ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2005 ; mem06 ; karlsson 2006 ) from which a binary system formed",
    ". then later a mass transfer across the system transferred li - depleted materials to the outer layers of the already c - rich secondary to match the constraint on li seen in he1327 - 2326 .",
    "combination models of this type are possible and might help explain the diversity of abundance patterns in light , alpha , and neutron capture elements in metal - poor stars .",
    "however , each of the three origin scenarios have uncertainties in input physics and parameters that are only magnified by attempting to combine them .",
    "it therefore seems wise to restrict consideration to a single model , and combine them only when when new data demands it .",
    "for the two hmps , it is not necessary to make the model more complicated than a binary mass - transfer event in an originally c - normal system .",
    "using detailed comparisons of abundance patterns and proposed models , i have argued that the hmps formed as the low - mass secondary in a binary system with an intermediate - mass star . in this scenario ,",
    "the light elements seen in the hmps come from the agb primary , and the heavier @xmath35-capture elements , the iron - group elements , and the neutron capture elements originated in the massive star progenitor(s ) that the companions shared .",
    "given the reasonable fit of the mainstream emp data to the fe - peak abundances of the hmps , these progenitors may have been primordial or low - metallicity stars like those that preceded the mainstream emps .",
    "having selected this model , we can ask what implications follow for star formation in extremely metal - poor environments .",
    "the first , and perhaps most important implication , is that low - mass stars _ can _ form at @xmath1 , even if only in binary systems .",
    "thus if there is a clear - cut , single metallicity criterion for low - mass star formation ( as proposed by , e.g. bromm & loeb 2003 ) , then that metallicity is about this value .",
    "more likely , this critical metallicity criterion exists but manifests not as a step function but instead is smoothed out by some other effect , perhaps environmental conditions such as gas density , uv radiation backgrounds , or dust abundance and grain size distributions ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) , or detailed relative abundances ( santoro & shull 2006 ) .",
    "another implication of the binary mass - transfer hypothesis follows from considering not only the presence of these two cno - rich , low - mass companions of intermediate mass stars , but also the apparent absence of isolated , c - normal stars at the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "if the binary star statistics of stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath125 are similar to those at solar metallicity , with binary fractions of 60% , then isolated low - mass stars should easily outnumber pairings with the exact masses ( a primary of @xmath85 @xmath3  and a secondary of @xmath126 @xmath3  for the suda et al .",
    "2004 model ) needed to reproduce the observed abundances . if the hmp systems formed with a certain orbital separation and/or eccentricity , then the implied configurations should be still rarer .",
    "yet in an apparently unbiased sample of metal - poor stars , _ both _ of the first two hmps to be discovered arose in a particular binary configuration that leaves the observed abundance patterns .",
    "this leaves the puzzling implication that in the stellar generations with [ fe / h ]  @xmath125 , binary pairings between low- and intermediate - mass stars are more common than isolated low - mass stars .",
    "theoretical studies of star formation at low and zero metallicity suggest a simple solution to this puzzle that is fully consistent with the observed data : it is that lms / ims binaries outnumber isolated lms because the imf is top - heavy , or skewed toward imss at [ fe / h ]  @xmath125 . for example , an imf with characteristic mass @xmath127 @xmath3  and a suitable binary fraction will form relatively few isolated low - mass stars , but if gas fragmentation with metal - line cooling is sufficient then binaries could form with _ total _ mass @xmath127 @xmath3  and one low - mass secondary companion . after a suitably long time",
    "the primary stars will evolve off the main sequence , eject some light elements , and fade to a white dwarf .",
    "the secondaries are then seen as low - mass , extremely metal - poor stars with cno enhanced surfaces , as proposed by lucatello et al ( 2005 ) and komiya et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the cemp stars . to reproduce the observed numbers , low - mass stars formed in binaries and fated to experience cno enrichment",
    "must be more common than isolated low mass stars , and a top - heavy imf is a natural way to do this .    a simple stellar population model can determine what imf is capable of giving the observed result .",
    "a random sample of a hundred stars of solar metallicity in the nearby galactic neighborhood is rather unlikely to include more than few binaries that consist of a primary with @xmath128 @xmath3  and a secondary with @xmath129 0.8 @xmath3 , the combination that is needed to give rise to systems like he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 in the binary hypothesis .",
    "the likelihood of this outcome can be calculated precisely for an arbitrary imf and binary fraction , as follows .",
    "the imf is described by either a broken power law or log - normal function .",

    "the `` normal '' imf is that given by kroupa ( 2002 ) a power law dependence , @xmath134 from @xmath135 @xmath3 , and @xmath136 from @xmath137 @xmath3 . both functions run from 0.1 to 140 @xmath3 .",
    "i further assume , in accord with theories for the formation of binary stars in the galactic neighborhood ( tohline 2002 ) , that most fragmentation into binaries follows the formation of the protostellar core , such that the imf describes the distribution of `` core masses '' , equivalent to the stellar mass for isolated stars or the total mass of binaries .",
    "a fraction of the `` cores '' , @xmath138 , are assumed to be binaries , subject to the condition that a fraction @xmath139 ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) of all stars with @xmath140 @xmath3  end up in binaries .",

    "the stellar imf at metallicities below [ fe / h ]  @xmath33 can not be addressed directly in galaxies in the local universe , and may never be accessible directly for galaxies in the true conditions that obtained in the early universe .",
    "for the foreseeable future , local indicators like those used here will be the primary means for testing theories of star formation in the early phases of galaxy formation at @xmath176 .",
    "this work owes to the teams of observers responsible for the discovery and characterization of the two hmp stars a debt that goes beyond what mere citations to their papers can convey .",
    "i am also pleased to acknowledge again the precursor work of the various theoretical groups whose work is discussed here .",
    "i gratefully acknowledge the generous support of gilbert and jaylee mead for their namesake fellowship in the yale center for astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "helpful comments by an anonymous referee provoked numerous clarifications and improvements .",

    "<S> the two known `` hyper - metal - poor '' ( hmp ) stars , he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 , have extremely high enhancements of the light elements c , n , and o relative to fe and appear to represent a statistically significant excess population relative to the halo metallicity distribution extrapolated from [ fe / h ] @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this study weighs the available evidence for and against three hypothetical origins for these stars : ( 1 ) that they formed from gas enriched by a primordial `` faint supernova '' , ( 2 ) that they formed from gas enriched by core - collapse supernovae and c - rich gas ejected in rotation - driven winds from massive stars , and ( 3 ) that they formed as the low - mass secondaries in binary systems at @xmath1 and acquired their light - element enhancements from an intermediate - mass companion as it passed through an agb phase . </S>",
    "<S> the observations interpreted here , especially the depletion of lithium seen in he1327 - 2326 , favor the binary mass - transfer hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> if he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 formed in binary systems , the statistically significant absence of isolated and/or c - normal stars at similar [ fe / h ]  implies that low - mass stars could form at that metallicity , but that masses @xmath2 @xmath3  were disfavored in the imf . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also explained if the abundance - derived top - heavy imf for primordial stars persists to [ fe / h ] @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this finding indicates that low - mass star formation was possible at extremely low metallicity , and that the typical stellar mass may have had a complex dependence on metallicity rather than a sharp transition driven solely by gas cooling . </S>"
