    "neural synchrony is believed to be an important mechanism underlying many phenomena in the human brain .",
    "@xcite it has been extensively studied using approaches and methods of physics and nonlinear dynamics ( see refs .  ) .",
    "neural synchrony strength is likely to be variable in time .",
    "the neural oscillations are known to exhibit intermittent synchronization in both healthy and diseased human and animal brain even at rest ( see refs .  ) .",
    "it was suggested that transient dynamics in the nervous system is generic .",
    "@xcite neural signals may go in and out of synchrony due to variety of factors and approaches to detect and quantify the presence of this variable and weak synchrony have been considered ( see refs .  ) .",
    "however , the properties of how this synchrony is patterned in time have not being explored in normal human subjects .",
    "since this synchrony is not perfect , the same synchrony strength may be achieved with markedly different temporal patterns of activity ( roughly speaking oscillations may go out of the phase - locked state for many short episodes or few long episodes ) . however , synchrony is a non - instantaneous phenomenon and from the data analysis perspective one considers synchrony in a statistical sense , observed over a sufficiently large number of cycles of oscillations .",
    "@xcite yet if this synchrony is present on the average , one can look at each cycle of oscillations and see how far away it is from a synchronized state .",
    "@xcite this approach can describe the differences in the dynamics and temporal structure of synchronization / desynchronization events for the systems with similar overall level of phase locking or similar stability of synchronized state .",
    "@xcite this is especially important given that the neural synchrony in the current study , and a number of other neural systems , is not very strong .",
    "the underlying network of presumably weakly coupled oscillators spends a substantial fraction of time in the non - synchronous state .",
    "thus the focus on desynchronization episodes is very reasonable .",
    "this approach has been recently applied to study the temporal patterns of the pathological synchronization in subcortical brain areas in a group of patients with parkinson s disease .",
    "@xcite locally measured synchronous ( on the average ) oscillatory activity was observed to follow a specific pattern : the synchronized state was interrupted by numerous but mostly short desynchronization states .",
    "however it was not known if this was a signature of parkinson s disease , a feature of the specific subcortical location , or a more general phenomenon .",
    "here we show that the latter is more likely to be the case .",
    "since synchrony is important to facilitate interactions between neurons ,  @xcite the temporal patterning of this synchrony becomes a salient issue .",
    "we study synchronized patterns of neural activity in a large sample of healthy humans at rest and during an execution of a task .",
    "similar temporal patterning of synchronous activity in large cortical areas in different states may suggest that i ) this type of patterning is a generic phenomenon in the brain , ii ) it may have some functional advantages for oscillating neural networks receiving , processing , and transmitting information , iii ) it may be grounded in some general properties of neuronal networks calling for the development of appropriate nonlinear dynamical theory .",
    "we used 64-channel electroencephalograms ( eeg ) of the international 10 - 10 system at the sampling rate of 160 hz recorded from 109 normal human subjects using the bci2000 system  @xcite and available at physionet .",
    "@xcite to exclude very closely positioned electrodes we used the data from only 19 electrodes ( corresponding to the international 10 - 20 system ) .",
    "each subject was recorded in two different experimental conditions : one minute baseline recording ( rest , eyes open ) and total of six minutes of recordings of fist movement tasks . during the task period",
    ", each subject would perform a series of visually triggered 4 seconds long series of opening and closing fist movements ( followed by 4 second rest intervals excluded from the analysis ) . in this study",
    ", we analyze three different groups of data : _ baseline all _ , _ task all _ , and _ task c3-c4_. baseline all includes data from all 19 eeg electrodes during baseline recordings .",
    "task all includes data from all 19 eeg electrodes during the task periods .",
    "task c3-c4 includes only the data from c3 and c4 electrodes ( which are close to the motor cortex ) during the task periods .",
    "phase domain is an appropriate way to analyze weakly synchronized neural signals .",
    "@xcite as the coupling strength increases from low to moderate values synchrony may be observed in the phase domain while the amplitudes of oscillations remain uncorrelated .",
    "@xcite thus phase may provide a more sensitive and appropriate metric to explore the relatively moderately synchronized dynamics we study here .",
    "all signals were referenced to the mean eeg of two ears .",
    "eegs first filtered in @xmath2 and @xmath3 frequency bands with kaiser windowed digital fir filter sampled at 160 hz and zero - phase filtering was implemented to avoid phase distortions .",
    "phase was then extracted via hilbert transform resulting in the time - series of phases ( see refs .  ) . for each pair of this time - series ( measured at the same time )",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 we consider a standard index to characterize the strength of the phase locking between these two signals : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the phase difference .",
    "this synchronization index varies from 0 ( complete lack of phase locking ) to 1 ( perfect phase locking ) .",
    "however , this phase locking index is not designed to describe the fine temporal structure of the dynamics , rather it provides an overall index of phase synchrony .",
    "@xcite thus even if evaluated on the short time window , it necessarily should include sufficiently large number of oscillations and can not be used to inspect if the oscillations are at the preferred phase lag or not at each cycle .    in order to assess the fine temporal structure of synchronous dynamics of the signal we employed the analysis of phase synchronization on short time scales via first - return maps .",
    "@xcite this method allows for an analysis of the temporal development of phase difference if some level of synchrony ( some preferred phase - locking angle ) is present .",
    "briefly , whenever the phase of the reference signal crossed from negative to positive values , we recorded the phase of the other signal , generating a set of consecutive phase values @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of such crossing . then @xmath10 was plotted .",
    "the predominantly synchronous dynamics appeared as a cluster of points , with the center at the diagonal @xmath11 we used the kolmogorov - smirnov test to detect non - uniform distribution of @xmath12 with the significance level of 0.05 to include a recording in the further analysis ( the results were not qualitatively affected by this level ) .",
    "after determining the center of the cluster for each pair of analyzed signals , all values of the phases were shifted by the same amount to position the center of the cluster to the center of the region i ( see fig .  [ phase_diagram ] ) .",

    "the arrows indicate all possible transitions between regions and the expressions next to the arrows indicate the rates for these transitions .",
    ", width=192,height=192 ]    this phase space was then partitioned into four regions numbered in a clockwise manner , since this is the primary direction of the dynamics .",
    "the region i is centered around the state with the most frequently observed ( preferred ) phase difference , and is defined as a synchronized state . in this sense , other three regions are considered as desynchronized states .",
    "note that the system can stay in the third region near diagonal for several iterations of the map ( several cycles of oscillations ) .",
    "however , this happens relatively rarely .",
    "so region i is the region which corresponds to the most preferred time lag ; it is a synchronized state in this essentially data - driven approach .",
    "thus the synchronized state here is the one where the deviation from the preferred phase angle is less than @xmath14    transition rates @xmath15 for the transitions between four regions of the map are defined as the number of points in a region , from which the trajectory leaves the region to another region , divided by the total number of points in the original region ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath16 is the ratio of the number of trajectories escaping the region i for the region ii to the number of all points in the region i. all rates vary between 0 and 1 .",
    "the transition rates @xmath17 are related to the durations of desynchronizations and define them completely if transitions are independent . however , as we will show below , transitions were not fully independent in the data considered here .",
    "in addition to this four - state model we will also consider a two - state model , where all three desynchronized states are lumped together into a single desynchronized state .",

    "the transition matrix of two - state model is @xmath33 if @xmath34 , then this system is in the detailed balance .",

    "so that if the system is perturbed from a stationary distribution , it settles back to a stationary distribution after just one time - step ( if there is small , but non - zero eigenvalue , the convergence is exponential , but very fast ) . roughly speaking , @xmath35 and @xmath36 so that for synchronous on the average episodes we look at about a quarter of pairs of locations of the studied brain network are in non - synchronous state and about three quarters are in synchronous state .",
    "if this distribution is perturbed , the system gets back to the stationary state within just one cycle of oscillations given the observed transition rates .",
    "similar considerations are valid for the four - state model as well .",
    "the transition matrix of four - state model ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is @xmath37 if @xmath38 , then the eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 ( multiplicity of 3 ) and 1 .",

    "however even in the latter case the considered brain networks will be in a state where the perturbed system rapidly converges to the stationary distribution .    finally , we analyzed the data from pairs of distant electrodes to eliminate volume conduction effects , which may potentially affect the analysis of the patterning of synchrony .",

    "the chances of longer desynchronization episodes decreased as the duration of the desynchronization episodes increases .",
    "moreover , the studied system appears to be in a detailed balance between synchronized and desynchronized states within the framework of the two - state model .",
    "both the two - state model and four - state model can capture the temporal pattern of the short desynchronization events ( length of one cycle of oscillations ) in the considered study .",
    "however , the two - state model can not distinguish the difference between two different systems with the same stability of the synchronized state or synchrony level and @xmath30 , while the four - state model can effectively discriminate the difference .",
    "@xcite moreover , from an experimental viewpoint we do not know in a priori whether the two - state model is enough to capture most of the important temporal dynamics of complex systems .",
    "we also would like to reiterate that both models are a way to describe synchronizations / desynchronizations in pairs of different brain areas as they develop in time rather than a detection of multiple patterns of synchronous and nonsynchronous pairs or clusters in spatially complex partially synchronized regime ( like in ref .  ) .",
    "moderate coupling strength in a system of two coupled oscillators may induce the same strength of phase - locking , while the dynamics may be dominated by both long and short desynchronization episodes depending on the type of oscillators .",
    "@xcite thus different desynchronization patterns provide different means to generate the same moderate synchrony levels .",
    "however , our analysis of eeg data indicates that the brain networks favor moderate synchrony with frequent short desynchronizations .",
    "while the particulars of the fine temporal structure in each frequency band are different , qualitatively our observations hold true both at rest and during task execution , for pair - wise synchrony across all brain areas as measured by eeg and for synchrony in the motor cortex .",
    "note that the analysis of micro - electrode measured neural activity from subcortical areas of parkinsonian patients also showed the dominance of short desynchronization events .",
    "@xcite thus , this dominance of short desynchronizations may be a generic feature of brain networks .    in line with this",
    ", it is interesting to note that dynamics of the phase synchronization of neuroimaging data from the human brain shows power law probability distribution , compatible with dynamical criticality , of both periods of phase - lock interval and rapid change of synchronization at broad frequency bands .",
    "@xcite while that study was focused on a longer time scales ( the analysis involved averaging , thus desynchronization was not followed from cycle to cycle of oscillations ) , those results suggest functional implications similar to ours .",
    "this criticality of the human brain may have capacity to change the configuration rapidly in response to external inputs more efficiently .",
    "@xcite    even though the functional significance of the observed distribution of desynchronization events is yet unknown , we can speculate on potential functional implications .",
    "as noted in the beginning of this paper , neural synchrony has been conjectured to be important for several neural functions , including the formation of neuronal assemblies .",
    "short desynchronizations may be more likely to facilitate the function of synchrony in the overall low - synchrony environment , because the synchronous state frequently gets a chance to reestablish itself ( although for short time )",
    ". numerous short desynchronizations ( as opposed to infrequent , but long desynchronizations ) are likely to indicate that synchrony is both easy to form and easy to break .",
    "the probability of the shortest desynchronization ( length of one cycle of oscillations ) increases during a task , then it decreases to the baseline state during the resting state .",
    "this may suggests that whenever a cell assembly must be formed to facilitate a particular function or task , short desynchronization dynamics may allow for a quick and efficient formation and break - up of such an assembly . on the other hand , the ramifications of the transition matrices",
    "whose eigenvalues are only 0 and 1 where eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 1 , which we discuss above , suggest that once the stationary distribution of synchronized and desynchronized states is perturbed , the system converges back to this stationary ( and presumably beneficial ) distribution very fast .    finally , we need to note that our analysis does not explore the potential role of noise in our observations .",
    "noise can have a substantial effect on intermittent phenomena , however it is hard to manipulate in neurophysiological experiment",
    ". nevertheless , time - series analysis used here does not make assumptions regarding the noisy component of the data .",
    "moreover , modeling of neural - like ( conductance - based ) oscillators suggested that transition rates and the duration of desynchronization events are only weakly affected by noise of mild intensity .",
