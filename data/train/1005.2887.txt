    "this system belongs to the class of variable - mass problems usually considered in undergraduate physics textbooks . among the various possible experimental configurations we cite a few that have been considered recent .",

    "the only experimental realization of this system has been reported by van den berg.@xcite a theoretical description of the idealized problem , extended to the more general case of an additional constant vertical force acting on the upper end , was performed by ma and j. podolsk,@xcite which also cites unavailable czech and russian bibliography , especially the role of graf georg von buquoy , who was `` the first who investigated mechanical systems with a varying mass . ''",
    "there is a mention in the solutions manual by thornton and marion@xcite of the possibility of the free upper end falling faster than a freely falling mass , which is a puzzling effect .",
    "the authors report a personal communication from m.  g.  calkin who ``   has found that experimentally the time of fall for this problem is consistently less @xmath1 by about 1.5% '' and ``   also finds evidence that suggests the free fall treatment is more valid if the table is energy absorbing . ''",
    "we shall see that this effect is striking .",
    "the dynamics of the falling chain is usually treated as follows .",
    "consider an inextensible and perfectly flexible chain of length @xmath2 with a homogeneous linear mass density @xmath3 . at @xmath4",

    "the free end of the chain has fallen a distance @xmath6 so that a part of the weight @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the acceleration due to gravity ) lies at rest on the pan . at the same time , the falling part of the chain ( length @xmath9 ) moves downward with velocity @xmath10 ( the chain is inextensible ) .",
    "the total force , @xmath11 , exerted by the scale on the chain at time @xmath12 opposes the weight @xmath13 of the already deposited part of the chain and exerts the force @xmath14 necessary to stop the chain links that collide with the pan .",
    "the latter contribution can be estimated by considering that during the time interval @xmath15 , a mass @xmath16 of the chain ( @xmath17 ) with velocity @xmath10 at the beginning of the interval collides with the pan and comes to rest ( assuming that the collision is perfectly inelastic ) .",

    "the reading of the scale corresponds to the norm of @xmath11 : @xmath20 this result holds if @xmath3 is constant and the links that collide with the pan stop .",
    "it is usually further assumed that the chain experiences free fall . in this case ,",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and we obtain [ xx usually we write @xmath23 for the vertical displacement xx ] @xmath24 during the fall , the apparent weight of the chain , @xmath25 , increases quadratically in time and equals , at each instant , three times the weight @xmath26 of the part of the chain already deposited on the scale pan .",

    "the chain is assumed to be homogeneous ( constant mass density @xmath3 along its length ) and has no limiting radius of curvature ( it can be bent infinitely ) . in a real experiment these two assumptions are not fully satisfied . in particular",
    ", we shall see that the assumption of free - fall does not hold when the minimum radius of curvature is finite .",
    "we shall report measurements obtained with two chains , namely a `` ball chain '' and a `` loop chain '' ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the ball chain consists of stainless - steel identical links ( length @xmath32 m ) [ xx better to use @xmath33 since @xmath34 is difficult to distinguish from 1 xx ] that are each made from one rod and a hollow sphere ( diameter @xmath35 m ) attached to each other .",

    "its total length , number of links , and mass are respectively @xmath43 m , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 kg .    the experimental setup ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] ) consists of two parts .",
    "the part at the top holds the chain previous to its release and the part at the bottom measures the force exerted during its fall .",
    "the system at the top [ see fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) ] makes it possible to simultaneously release the chain and a steel ball , so we can compare the motion of the chain with free - fall , and accurately determine the beginning of its motion .",
    "it is an adaptation of the system described in ref .  .",
    "the upper end of the chain is initially attached with a nylon cord ( fishing line , diameter 10@xmath46 m ) to a steel ball such that the joining cord is held by a nickel wire ( diameter 10@xmath46 m ) .",
    "two horizontal parallel rods are used to separate the falling paths of the two bodies .",
    "the whole system is adjusted so that initially the chain and the ball are at the same height . to initiate the fall",
    ", we quickly cut the nylon wire by injecting a large electric current ( about 1a ) from a power supply in the metallic wire , during a few tenths of second .",
    "the mount holding the nickel wire is a slightly - flexible cantilever spring , and the release of the bodies results in a sudden upward acceleration of its free end . measuring this acceleration by means of an accelerometer ( dytran , 3035bg ) makes it possible to accurately determine the origin of time , @xmath4 .",
    "the vertical component of the force applied by the falling chain ( apparent weight @xmath25 ) is measured by a force - sensor ( load cell , testwell , kd40s , maximum force 10n ) which holds a vessel made from a horizontal disk ( dural , diameter 6 cm ) surrounded by high walls which prevent the chain or the steel ball from escaping the system [ see fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) ] .",
    "as described in the following , the vessel can be filled with different materials to change the experimental conditions at the bottom .",
    "the material of the walls ( paper or plastic ) can also be changed .",
    "the signals from the accelerometer and the force sensor are monitored using an acquisition board ( national instruments , pci 6251 ) .",
    "given that the typical length of the chains used in the experiments is approximately 2 m , the duration of the free fall is consistently about 0.6s ( with @xmath47  m / s@xmath48 ) .",
    "we acquired the signals at 10khz , which is sufficient to reveal the details of the force dynamics while avoiding the need to manipulate large data sets .",
    "it is important to discuss the typical force - signal obtained for a ball chain falling in an empty vessel ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) . instead of the continuous quadratic increase in the apparent weight @xmath25 with time",
    ", we observe large fluctuations whose amplitude increases in time until the end of the fall .",
    "the large peaks that characterize the force signal are a natural consequence of the discrete nature of the chain .",
    "the links hit the bottom of the vessel almost independently of each other and , as their velocity increases in time due to the acceleration of gravity , the amplitude and the frequency of the peaks increase as well .",
    "we could avoid the peaks by using a sensor with a long characteristic time . however , the frequency of the collisions ranges from about 30 to 1300hz during the fall .",
    "the choice of a characteristic time larger than @xmath49ms would hide some relevant details of the fall .",
    "thus , we chose a sensor with a resonant frequency of nearly 500hz , which makes it possible to obtain a temporal resolution of about 2ms .",
    "the `` hidden '' ideal force can then be revealed using a numerical filtering procedure ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , inset ) that might wipe out relevant features of the signal .",
    "[ xx i m confused . if the force can be revealed , what is being wiped out ?",
    "xx ]    instead of using a numerical filter , we look for a cleaner force signal by changing the experimental conditions at the bottom . to efficiently reduce the amplitude of the oscillations , we filled the vessel successively with various viscous and non - newtonian fluids , a granular material , diluted modeling clay , and cotton wool .",
    "the force always exhibited violent oscillations except when a thick layer of cotton wool ( typically a few centimeters ) was placed at the bottom of the vessel [ see fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) ] .",
    "the signal from the force sensor obtained after addition of @xmath50 g of cotton shows a monotonic increase in the force during the fall and a final drop to the weight of the entire chain when its motion ceases in the vessel ( seefig .  [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "the low - frequency oscillations ( at @xmath51hz ) at the tail of the signal are produced by restoring forces in the cotton bed .",
    "our results show that the cotton layer constitutes a very efficient method of damping the force signal , and we therefore used it in our measurements .",
    "one advantage is that we are able to identify short - time features of the force signal , in particular , the time at which the last link of the chain hits the pan ( maximum of the force ) , which otherwise would be smoothed out by a numerical filtering procedure .",
    "we see in fig .  [ figure5 ]",
    "that the measured apparent weight does not follow the theoretical curve and , in particular , the maximum force is much larger , about 5.5 times the weight of the chain .",
    "we might claim that the difference originates from the condition at the bottom but , even more striking than the value of the maximum force , we notice in figs .",
    "[ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] that the force drops to its rest value earlier than predicted for free fall .",
    "whatever the condition at the bottom , the free end of the chain falls faster than expected .",
    "the difference is significant , about @xmath52ms , corresponding to @xmath53 of the total length of the chain .    to check that the ball chain does fall faster than a simple body in free fall",
    ", we photographed the simultaneous falls of the chain and of the steel ball . in this experiment the surface at the bottom is hard and flat ( wood board covered by an acrylic layer ) so that the dissipation is much less than for the vessel padded with cotton wool .",
    "the sequence in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] is conclusive : the last link is clearly ahead of the ball during the entire fall , which is possible only if , in addition to its own weight , a tensional force @xmath54 pulls the falling part of the chain downward .",
    "the origin of this force is surprising because the force exerted on the chain due to the pan is oriented upward .",
    "it is interesting to consider several mechanisms that could alter the dynamics of the chain and explain the deviation from free fall .",
    "_ air friction_. the falling chain is subjected to friction with the surrounding air .",
    "this friction is the same along the chain , and thus does not generate any tension , but rather reduces homogeneously the chain velocity .",
    "this drag , which increases the time of fall , is not responsible for the experimental observations .",
    "_ initial tension of the chain_. previous to its release , the chain , which is hanging from its upper end , is subjected to a tension @xmath54 as a consequence of its own weight .",
    "mechanical equilibrium imposes @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the position in a frame of coordinates attached to the chain , oriented upward ; the origin is attached to the uppermost link .",
    "when the chain is released , a longitudinal wave propagates from top to bottom , accelerating the links downward . from the value of the elastic constant associated with the stretching , @xmath57n ( defined by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the elongation and @xmath2 the initial length , and @xmath54 is obtained by measuring the elongation due to known masses ) , we estimate that the wave propagates at the velocity @xmath60 m/s , assuming the chain to be continuous .",
    "thus , the wave front reaches the lowermost link 3ms after the release of the uppermost one .",
    "this relaxation leads to a contraction of about @xmath61 m of the chain and to an acceleration of the center of mass toward the bottom .",
    "it is interesting to consider the associated decrease in the fall time , which can be estimated by an energy argument .",
    "the total elastic energy initially stored in the chain is @xmath62 .",
    "if all the elastic energy was transferred to kinetic energy of the whole chain , the latter would gain an initial velocity @xmath63 m/s , derived from the condition @xmath64 , which leads to a decrease in the fall time , @xmath65 , of about 2ms , much smaller than the experimental value of @xmath52ms ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the initial tension of the chain does not explain the observed behavior , even for our unrealistic hypothesis that all the elastic energy goes into kinetic energy . in a process more consistent with momentum conservation",
    "the chain would rapidly dissipate the elastic energy because of the friction associated with the relative motion of the links .",
    "we can thus assume that the chain as a whole starts falling from rest at @xmath4 , in spite of its initial tension .",
    "_ finite bending limit of the chain_. we have to abandon the infinite flexibility approximation for a real chain , which can fold only over a finite distance with a geometry that depends on its construction .",
    "specifically , there exists a minimum accessible radius of curvature , equal to a few times the link length .",
    "we shall see that this fact is responsible for the deviation of the experiments from the simplistic theory assuming free - fall .",
    "what is the origin of the downward pulling force responsible for a net acceleration larger than @xmath0 , explaining the earlier arrival of the free end ?",
    "a similar phenomenon is well known in the context of another variable - mass problem , namely the partial fall of a chain that is held by its two ends at the same height and then released at one of its ends.@xcite the free end is observed to fall faster than a simple body in free - fall .",
    "this behavior is easy to understand if we consider that the energy is conserved during the fall,@xcite so that while more and more links come to rest , the potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the falling part , which contains fewer and and links .",
    "the continuous decrease in the mass of the moving part results in a continuous increase in the acceleration . the energy is likely not to be conserved , due to internal dissipation associated with the relative motion of the links .",
    "morin@xcite draws a distinction between a dissipative ( loosely spaced links joined by a massless string ) and a non - dissipative ( closely spaced links ) chain , and discusses the influence of the folding on the dynamics for each case .    in our experimental configuration",
    "the energy is not conserved because the chain remains at rest after the fall .",
    "therefore we will discuss a model based on newton s laws .",
    "we will see that the geometry of the folding at the bottom is crucial and that , to account for the dynamics of the chain , we must consider not only the momentum but also the angular momentum [ xx you used kinetic moment , but that term is never used in any classical mechanics book i know of .",
    "i assume you mean angular momentum xx ] of the system .",
    "we will not solve a set of coupled equations modeling the dynamics of each link .",
    "such models exist,@xcite but they would obscure the simple physics that is sufficient to understand the phenomenon . we thus consider a minimal model containing the basic elements that describe our observations .",
    "the main difference between the ideal case and the experiment is that the chain can not be bent infinitely and , thus , exhibits a minimum accessible radius of curvature @xmath66 . the ideal chain would fall vertically toward a single point @xmath67 .",
    "instead the real chain is straight and falls vertically in a large part of its length , but bends and curls close to the bottom in a region of typical size @xmath68 .",
    "based on the experimental observations ( see fig .  [ figure6 ] ) , we approximate the shape of the falling chain according to the illustration in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "we discard the details of the heap formation and the exact shape of the curled part , and consider that the chain hits the bottom at the point p which is a finite distance @xmath69 ( of the order of @xmath66 ) from o. the dynamical part @xmath14 of the total force exerted by the bottom on the chain is applied at p.    we denote by @xmath23 , the vertical coordinate ( oriented upward ) of the upper free end .",
    "[ xx here you use @xmath23 , not @xmath70 xx ] we assume that @xmath71 ; that is , the length of the falling part is much larger than the typical size of the curl . in this limit , we can neglect the momentum of the curl with respect to that of the vertical part and write the equation governing the change of momentum as @xmath72 where @xmath73 corresponds to the falling mass and @xmath74 to its vertical velocity .    in the same approximation , disregarding the rotation of the point p around o in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , we can estimate the horizontal component of the angular momentum , @xmath75 , of the chain about o to which only the curl contributes , because the vertical part points toward o and the remaining part of the chain is at rest .",
    "if we assume that in the curl , the links move with a velocity of the order of @xmath76 at a typical distance @xmath66 from o , we obtain @xmath77 ( where the sign is associated with a contact point on the right - hand side as sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) .",
    "the change in the angular momentum is due to two contributions .",
    "there is a change in the overall velocity of the chain @xmath76 , which leads to a term @xmath78 .",
    "also the links in the curl come to rest . in the curl the angular momentum goes from @xmath79 to @xmath80 in the typical time",

    "[ figure9 ] ) obtained for the fall on a cotton wool layer .",
    "thus , @xmath88 is independent of the dissipation at the bottom .",
    "note that the simple model fails to account for the finite value of the force because the approximation @xmath85 is no longer satisfied when the free end reaches the bottom .",
    "let us determine the tension that acts , according to our model , on the falling part of the chain and which is responsible for the larger than @xmath0 acceleration of the free end .",
    "for a length element @xmath107 of the chain and the tension @xmath54 , we can write the change in the momentum as @xmath108 thus , at a given time @xmath12 , the tension in the chain @xmath109 , where the condition @xmath110 at the free end is already taken into account . from eq .",

    "also whatever the value of @xmath88 , the total force applied to the curl equals @xmath115 .",

    "we have demonstrated that the existence of a minimum radius of curvature , which imposes a curl at the bottom , is responsible for the appearance of an additional tension in a falling chain , which pulls the falling part toward the bottom .",
    "however , the model discussed in sec .  [ sec5 ] leaves a few open questions .    in accord with our observations",
    ", we assumed that the chain falls vertically , except in a small region of size @xmath66 at the bottom .",
    "nonetheless , the deformation of the chain at the bottom excites transverse waves that can eventually climb along the chain .",

    "( [ tension ] ) , @xmath121 .",
    "the velocity @xmath120 , even at the bottom , is always smaller than the fall velocity so that the perturbations at the bottom can not propagate upward , which is the reason why the chain remains straight and vertical and does not move laterally .",

    "in contrast , the classical loop chain used in previous experiments@xcite does not exhibit a well - defined minimum radius of curvature and can apparently be bent without any resistance . in a similar experiment with the loop chain",
