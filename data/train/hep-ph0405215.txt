    "although the standard model of particle physics remains one of the great triumphs of modern science , it now appears that it fails at even the most basic level  providing a reasonably complete catalog of the building blocks of our universe .",
    "recent cosmological measurements have pinned down the amount of baryon , matter , and dark energy in the universe  @xcite . in units of the critical density , these energy densities are @xmath0 implying a non - baryonic dark matter component with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the normalized hubble expansion rate . both the central values and uncertainties were nearly unthinkable even just a few years ago .",
    "these measurements are clear and surprisingly precise evidence that the known particles make up only a small fraction of the total energy density of the universe .",
    "cosmology now provides overwhelming evidence for new particle physics .    at the same time , the microscopic properties of dark matter and dark energy are remarkably unconstrained by cosmological and astrophysical observations .",
    "theoretical insights from particle physics are therefore required , both to suggest candidates for dark matter and dark energy and to identify experiments and observations that may confirm or exclude these speculations .",
    "weak - scale supersymmetry is at present the most well - motivated framework for new particle physics .",
    "its particle physics motivations are numerous and are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : susyessentials ] .",
    "more than that , it naturally provides dark matter candidates with approximately the right relic density .",
    "this fact provides a strong , fundamental , and completely independent motivation for supersymmetric theories . for these reasons , the implications of supersymmetry for cosmology , and vice versa , merit serious consideration .",
    "many topics lie at the interface of particle physics and cosmology , and supersymmetry has something to say about nearly every one of them .",
    "regrettably , spacetime constraints preclude detailed discussion of many of these topics .",
    "although the discussion below will touch on a variety of subjects , it will focus on dark matter , where the connections between supersymmetry and cosmology are concrete and rich , the above - mentioned quantitative evidence is especially tantalizing , and the role of experiments is clear and promising .",

    "supersymmetry is an extension of the known spacetime symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the spacetime symmetries of rotations , boosts , and translations are generated by angular momentum operators @xmath3 , boost operators @xmath4 , and momentum operators @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 generators form lorentz symmetry , and all 10 generators together form poincare symmetry .",
    "supersymmetry is the symmetry that results when these 10 generators are further supplemented by fermionic operators @xmath8 .",
    "it emerges naturally in string theory and , in a sense that may be made precise  @xcite , is the maximal possible extension of poincare symmetry .",
    "if a symmetry exists in nature , acting on a physical state with any generator of the symmetry gives another physical state .",
    "for example , acting on an electron with a momentum operator produces another physical state , namely , an electron translated in space or time .",
    "spacetime symmetries leave the quantum numbers of the state invariant  in this example , the initial and final states have the same mass , electric charge , etc .    in an exactly supersymmetric world , then , acting on any physical state with the supersymmetry generator @xmath8 produces another physical state . as with the other spacetime generators",
    ", @xmath8 does not change the mass , electric charge , and other quantum numbers of the physical state .",
    "in contrast to the poincare generators , however , a supersymmetric transformation changes bosons to fermions and vice versa . the basic prediction of supersymmetry is , then , that for every known particle there is another particle , its superpartner , with spin differing by @xmath9 .",
    "one may show that no particle of the standard model is the superpartner of another .",
    "supersymmetry therefore predicts a plethora of superpartners , none of which has been discovered .",
    "mass degenerate superpartners can not exist  they would have been discovered long ago  and so supersymmetry can not be an exact symmetry .",
    "the only viable supersymmetric theories are therefore those with non - degenerate superpartners .",
    "this may be achieved by introducing supersymmetry - breaking contributions to superpartner masses to lift them beyond current search limits . at first sight",
    ", this would appear to be a drastic step that considerably detracts from the appeal of supersymmetry .",
    "it turns out , however , that the main virtues of supersymmetry are preserved even if such mass terms are introduced .",
    "in addition , the possibility of supersymmetric dark matter emerges naturally and beautifully in theories with broken supersymmetry .",
    "once supersymmetry is broken , the mass scale for superpartners is unconstrained .",
    "there is , however , a strong motivation for this scale to be the weak scale : the gauge hierarchy problem . in the standard model of particle physics ,",
    "the classical mass of the higgs boson @xmath10 receives quantum corrections .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : higgsmass ] . ) including quantum corrections from standard model fermions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one finds that the physical higgs boson mass is @xmath13 where the last term is the leading quantum correction , with @xmath14 the higgs - fermion coupling .",
    "@xmath15 is the ultraviolet cutoff of the loop integral , presumably some high scale well above the weak scale .",
    "if @xmath15 is of the order of the planck scale @xmath16 , the classical higgs mass and its quantum correction must cancel to an unbelievable 1 part in @xmath17 to produce the required weak - scale @xmath18 .",
    "this unnatural fine - tuning is the gauge hierarchy problem .    in the supersymmetric standard model , however , for every quantum correction with standard model fermions @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the loop ,",
    "there are corresponding quantum corrections with superpartners @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the physical higgs mass then becomes @xmath21 where the terms quadratic in @xmath15 cancel , leaving a term logarithmic in @xmath15 as the leading contribution . in this case , the quantum corrections are reasonable even for very large @xmath15 , and no fine - tuning is required .    in the case of exact supersymmetry , where @xmath22 , even the logarithmically divergent term vanishes .",
    "in fact , quantum corrections to masses vanish to all orders in perturbation theory , an example of powerful non - renormalization theorems in supersymmetry . from eq .",
    "( [ higgsmass ] ) , however , we see that exact mass degeneracy is not required to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "what _ is _ required is that the dimensionless couplings @xmath14 of standard model particles and their superpartners are identical , and that the superpartner masses be not too far above the weak scale ( or else even the logarithmically divergent term would be large compared to the weak scale , requiring another fine - tuned cancellation ) .",
    "this can be achieved simply by adding supersymmetry - breaking weak - scale masses for superpartners .",
    "in fact , other terms , such as some cubic scalar couplings , may also be added without re - introducing the fine - tuning .",
    "all such terms are called `` soft , '' and the theory with weak - scale soft supersymmetry - breaking terms is `` weak - scale supersymmetry . ''",
    "supersymmetric particles that are electrically neutral , and so promising dark matter candidates , are shown with their standard model partners in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutralspectrum ] . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "two higgs doublets are required to give mass to all fermions .",
    "the two neutral higgs bosons are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which give mass to the down - type and up - type fermions , respectively , and each of these has a superpartner . aside from this subtlety ,",
    "the superpartner spectrum is exactly as one would expect .",
    "it consists of spin 0 sneutrinos , one for each neutrino , the spin @xmath25 gravitino , and the spin @xmath9 bino , neutral wino , and down- and up - type higgsinos .",
    "these states have masses determined ( in part ) by the corresponding mass parameters listed in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : neutralspectrum ] .",
    "these parameters are unknown , but are presumably of the order of the weak scale , given the motivations described above .",
    "the gravitino is a mass eigenstate with mass @xmath26 .",

    "( see sec .",

    "the mass eigenstates are called neutralinos and denoted @xmath34 , in order of increasing mass . if @xmath35 , the lightest neutralino @xmath36 has a mass of approximately @xmath37 and is nearly a pure bino . however , for @xmath38 , @xmath36 is a mixture with significant components of each gauge eigenstate .",
    "finally , note that neutralinos are majorana fermions ; they are their own anti - particles .",
    "this fact has important consequences for neutralino dark matter , as will be discussed below .",
    "weak - scale superpartners solve the gauge hierarchy problem through their virtual effects .",
    "however , without additional structure , they also mediate baryon and lepton number violation at unacceptable levels .",
    "for example , proton decay @xmath39 may be mediated by a squark as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : protondecay ] .    an elegant way to forbid",
    "this decay is to impose the conservation of @xmath27-parity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath6 , and @xmath42 are baryon number , lepton number , and spin , respectively .",
    "all standard model particles have @xmath43 , and all superpartners have @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath27-parity conservation implies @xmath45 at each vertex , and so both vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig : protondecay ] are forbidden .",
    "proton decay may be eliminated without @xmath27-parity conservation , for example , by forbidding @xmath41 or @xmath6 violation , but not both . however , in these cases , the non - vanishing @xmath27-parity violating couplings are typically subject to stringent constraints from other processes , requiring some alternative explanation .    an immediate consequence of @xmath27-parity conservation",
    "is that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) can not decay to standard model particles and is therefore stable .",
    "particle physics constraints therefore naturally suggest a symmetry that provides a new stable particle that may contribute significantly to the present energy density of the universe .",
    "given @xmath27-parity conservation , the identity of the lsp has great cosmological importance .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is no help in identifying the lsp , as it may be solved with any superpartner masses , provided they are all of the order of the weak scale .",
    "what is required is an understanding of supersymmetry breaking , which governs the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms and the superpartner spectrum .",
    "the topic of supersymmetry breaking is technical and large .",
    "however , the most popular models have `` hidden sector '' supersymmetry breaking , and their essential features may be understood by analogy to electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model .",
    "the interactions of the standard model may be divided into three sectors .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hidden ] . ) the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector contains interactions involving only the higgs boson ( the higgs potential ) ; the observable sector contains interactions involving only what we might call the `` observable fields , '' such as quarks @xmath46 and leptons @xmath47 ; and the mediation sector contains all remaining interactions , which couple the higgs and observable fields ( the yukawa interactions ) .",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken in the ewsb sector when the higgs boson obtains a non - zero vev : @xmath48 .",
    "this is transmitted to the observable sector by the mediating interactions .",
    "the ewsb sector determines the overall scale of ewsb , but the interactions of the mediating sector determine the detailed spectrum of the observed particles , as well as much of their phenomenology",
    ".    models with hidden sector supersymmetry breaking have a similar structure .",
    "they have a supersymmetry breaking sector , which contains interactions involving only fields @xmath49 that are not part of the standard model ; an observable sector , which contains all interactions involving only standard model fields and their superpartners ; and a mediation sector , which contains all remaining interactions coupling fields @xmath49 to the standard model .",
    "supersymmetry is broken in the supersymmetry breaking sector when one or more of the @xmath49 fields obtains a non - zero vev : @xmath50 .",
    "this is then transmitted to the observable fields through the mediating interactions .",
    "in contrast to the case of ewsb , the supersymmetry - breaking vev @xmath51 has mass dimension 2 .",
    "( it is the vev of the auxiliary field of the @xmath49 supermultiplet . )    in simple cases where only one non - zero @xmath51 vev develops , the gravitino mass is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the reduced planck mass .",

    "when @xmath50 , these terms become mass terms for sfermions and gauginos .",
    "assuming order one constants , @xmath60    in supergravity models , the mediating interactions are gravitational , and so @xmath61 .",

    ", the gravitino or any standard model superpartner could in principle be the lsp .",

    "lowering the supersymmetry breaking scale as much as possible to @xmath73 gives @xmath74 , still a factor of @xmath75 too big .",
    "supersymmetry therefore eliminates from 1/4 to 1/2 of the fine - tuning in the cosmological constant , a truly underwhelming achievement .",
    "one must look deeper for insights about dark energy and a solution to the cosmological constant problem .      to obtain detailed information regarding the superpartner spectrum",
    ", one must turn to specific models .",
    "these are motivated by the expectation that the weak - scale supersymmetric theory is derived from a more fundamental framework , such as a grand unified theory or string theory , at smaller length scales .",
    "this more fundamental theory should be highly structured for at least two reasons .",

    "second , the gauge coupling constants unify at high energies in supersymmetric theories  @xcite , and a more fundamental theory should explain this .    from this viewpoint , the many parameters of weak - scale supersymmetry should be derived from a few parameters defined at smaller length scales through renormalization group evolution .",
    "minimal supergravity  @xcite , the canonical model for studies of supersymmetry phenomenology and cosmology , is defined by 5 parameters : @xmath76 where the most important parameters are the universal scalar mass @xmath77 and the universal gaugino mass @xmath78 , both defined at the grand unified scale @xmath79 .",

    "this figure illustrates several key features that hold more generally .",
    "first , as superpartner masses evolve from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , gauge couplings increase these parameters , while yukawa couplings decrease them . at the weak scale ,",
    "colored particles are therefore expected to be heavy , and unlikely to be the lsp .",
    "the bino is typically the lightest gaugino , and the right - handed sleptons ( more specifically , the right - handed stau @xmath83 ) are typically the lightest scalars .",
    "second , the mass parameter @xmath84 is typically driven negative by the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "this is a requirement for electroweak symmetry breaking : at tree - level , minimization of the electroweak potential at the weak scale requires @xmath85 where the last line follows for all but the lowest values of @xmath86 , which are phenomenologically disfavored anyway .",
    "clearly , this equation can only be satisfied if @xmath87 .",
    "this property of evolving to negative values is unique to @xmath84 ; all other mass parameters that are significantly diminished by the top yukawa coupling also experience a compensating enhancement from the strong gauge coupling .",
    "this behavior naturally explains why su(2 ) is broken while the other gauge symmetries are not .",
    "it is a beautiful feature of supersymmetry derived from a simple high energy framework and lends credibility to the extrapolation of parameters all the way up to a large mass scale like @xmath81 .    given a particular high energy framework , one may then scan parameter space to determine what possibilities exist for the lsp .",
    "the results for a slice through minimal supergravity parameter space are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msugra_lsp ] .",
    "they are not surprising .",

    "there are , of course , many other models besides minimal supergravity . phenomena that do not occur in minimal supergravity may very well occur or even be generic in other supersymmetric frameworks . on the other hand , if one looks hard enough , minimal supergravity contains a wide variety of dark matter possibilities , and it will serve as a useful framework for illustrating many points below .      * supersymmetry is a new spacetime symmetry that predicts the existence of a new boson for every known fermion , and a new fermion for every known boson . *",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem may be solved by supersymmetry , but requires that all superpartners have masses at the weak scale . *",
    "the introduction of superpartners at the weak scale mediates proton decay at unacceptably large rates unless some symmetry is imposed .",
    "an elegant solution , @xmath27-parity conservation , implies that the lsp is stable .",
    "electrically neutral superpartners , such as the neutralino and gravitino , are therefore promising dark matter candidates .",

    "the lightest neutralino naturally emerges as the dark matter candidate from the simple high energy framework of minimal supergravity . *",
    "supersymmetry reduces fine tuning in the cosmological constant from 1 part in @xmath69 to 1 part in @xmath75 to @xmath72 , and so does not provide much insight into the problem of dark energy .",
    "given the motivations described in sec .",
    "[ sec : susyessentials ] for stable neutralino lsps , it is natural to consider the possibility that neutralinos are the dark matter  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we review the general formalism for calculating thermal relic densities and its implications for neutralinos and supersymmetry .",
    "we then describe a few of the more promising methods for detecting neutralino dark matter .      dark matter may be produced in a simple and predictive manner as a thermal relic of the big bang .",
    "the very early universe is a very simple place  all particles are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "as the universe cools and expands , however , interaction rates become too low to maintain this equilibrium , and so particles `` freeze out . ''",
    "unstable particles that freeze out disappear from the universe . however , the number of stable particles asymptotically approaches a non - vanishing constant , and this , their thermal relic density , survives to the present day .",

    "we now want to apply the general formalism above to the specific case of neutralinos .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that neutralinos may annihilate to many final states : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and states including the heavy higgs bosons @xmath94 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",

    "the uncertainties and problems associated with these issues have been discussed extensively  @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that the relic densities , as determined independently by particle physics and cosmology , agree to 1% , but the detection rates differ .",
    "one would then be confident that neutralinos are the dark matter and particle physics uncertainties would be eliminated , allowing detection experiments to probe astrophysics . for example , direct detection rates would then provide information about the local dark matter density and velocity distributions , and indirect detection rates would provide information about halo profiles .",
