    "as baryon resonance properties , evaluated at the pole position , are now beginning to supersede and replace quantities that historically have been determined using breit - wigner ( bw ) plus background parameterizations , we extend a recent study  @xcite of photo - decay couplings at the pole to the regime of non - zero @xmath8 . the shift to pole - related quantities",
    "is reflected in the review of particle properties ( rpp )  @xcite , with many pole values coming from the bonn - gatchina multi - channel analyses  @xcite . some plots of transition form factors at the bw position , as a function of photon virtuality ,",
    "are now also available in the rpp .",
    "calculations at the pole are , in principle , well - defined and less model - dependent than the bw approach . however , the continuation of fit amplitudes to the pole is itself a possible source of error . with the aim to minimize model dependence of the pole extraction procedure",
    "this uncertainty has motivated numerous studies involving speed plots , regularization methods , contour integration  @xcite , and the most recent laurent series representations ( l+p ) based on separation of pole and regular part , and using the conformal mapping variable to expand the regular part in power series @xcite .    while analysis in terms of bw amplitudes is more in line with the early fits , based on simple bw plus background parameterizations , fits done within dynamical models",
    "are more naturally presented in terms of poles  @xcite . in the chiral effective field theory calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , complex form factor results at the pole could only be compared to real bw values coming from fits to data .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for related results . also , in chiral unitary resonance dynamics , there is no genuine resonance seed that would allow for the definition of a meaningful , purely real helicity coupling  @xcite . as a result",
    ", ad - hoc prescriptions were used to translate these results to quoted real bw helicity amplitudes . a proper comparison , however , requires the associated quantities extracted at the pole of amplitudes obtained from fits to experimental data .    to achieve this goal , we have extracted pole parameters with the l+p method from two energy - dependent ( ed ) partial wave analyses , maid and said , which are fitted to the world data base of pion electroproduction .",
    "the differences observed by this comparison will give an insight of the uncertainty of the pole form factors due to the differences in the maid and said techniques and consequently also to the experimental database .",
    "for the @xmath9 state , considerable attention  @xcite has been addressed to the @xmath8 evolution of amplitudes , as well as differences in the @xmath8 dependence of bare couplings , within models , and meson - cloud contributions . for a review ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "transition form factors are now also determined in lattice qcd simulations  @xcite . here , the quark masses are so large that the @xmath3 appears as a bound state , but it has been realized in ref .",
    "@xcite that in future simulations , close to the physical point , the finite resonance width will complicate the extraction .",
    "therefore , in ref .  @xcite a method has been proposed to determine transition form factors at the pole .",
    "this stresses again the relevance of providing pole values for existing phenomenological analyses , which is the aim of this study .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the @xmath9 virtual - photon decay amplitudes and related transition form factors .",
    "as the amplitudes themselves become infinite at the pole , we are interested in residues .",
    "the connection between multipole residues and the photo - decay amplitudes has been clarified in a previous paper  @xcite and in the note on n and delta resonance mini - reviews of the 2012 and 2014 pdg listings  @xcite .    here",
    "we will compare bw and pole extractions , using the maid2007 and said sm08 partial wave analyses of pion electroproduction data , utilizing the recent laurent + pietarinen ( l+p ) pole extraction method @xcite which has proven to be a precise and very reliable tool for the determination of pole positions and residues .",
    "the @xmath9 e / m and s / m ratios have been studied for many decades .",
    "interest in the e / m ratio , for real - photon interactions , was largely motivated by the fact that , in a simple non - relativistic quark model , this ratio would be zero  @xcite and , thus , deviations from zero would require more complicated interactions .",
    "the measured value of this ratio was small  @xcite , @xmath10 , but its precise value varied as photoproduction cross sections and beam - asymmetry @xmath11 measurements became more precise .",
    "the prediction for this ratio , at very large @xmath8 from pqcd  @xcite , has been more difficult to confirm .",
    "the ratio is predicted to become unity , whereas , at the real - photon point , it is small and negative .",
    "the variation of this ratio with @xmath8 has also changed significantly as electroproduction data have improved .    in section",
    "ii , we first give definitions of the standard bw quantities and then define the associated pole - valued results we will be considering . in section iii , we then give a brief overview of the bw and pole behavior of the @xmath9 amplitudes , which are constrained by watson s theorem .",
    "the l+p fit is described in section iv and compared to results from a fit , generalized to non - zero @xmath8 , described in ref .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our findings and prospects for future work .",

    "the helicity form factors can also be related to electric , magnetic and charge form factors .",
    "these so - called sachs form factors , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , are usually given in two different conventions by ash  @xcite and by jones and scadron  @xcite .",
    "both are related by a square - root factor , @xmath50 .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath3 transition form factors and give the corresponding expressions . for transitions with different spin and parity ,",
    "similar relations can be found , see @xcite .    for the @xmath51 transition , jones and scadron  @xcite give the following relations between the total cross sections and the sachs form factors : @xmath52    in the convention of ash , the sachs form factors take the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the virtual - photon momentum and the photon equivalent energy at resonance . because the @xmath3 is very close to an ideal resonance ,",
    "the real parts of the amplitudes vanish at @xmath58 , and the form factors can be directly expressed in terms of the imaginary parts of the corresponding multipoles at the ( breit wigner ) resonance position , @xmath59 where @xmath60^{1/2}$ ] with @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 being the pion momentum at resonance .",
    "similarly , we can define the sachs form factors , using ash s conventions , at the pole position @xmath63 where @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] .    in the literature ,",
    "the following ratios of multipoles have been defined : @xmath65 the ratios at the pole position are given accordingly @xmath66",
    "in general , a pion photo- or electroproduction amplitude @xmath67 , or any multipole , can be written as a sum of resonance and background contributions @xmath68 in order to obtain the bw amplitudes at the resonance position , the resonance part has to be modeled in bw form with energy - dependent partial widths for all possible decay channels and with energy - dependent phases in order to obey unitarity , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , this resonance - background separation is only possible in a model dependent way  @xcite .",
    "consequently , this also leads to some model dependence in the mass @xmath69 , width @xmath70 and for the amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the only exception in the baryonic spectrum is the @xmath3 , which is purely elastic and therefore has a well - defined k - matrix pole , @xmath71  mev , where the scattering phase @xmath72 . for the @xmath3 this coincides with the breit - wigner resonance position . due to watson s theorem ,",
    "also for pion photo- and electroproduction , the phase is exactly 90 degrees at resonance and the resonance - background separation is unique , as the background amplitude @xmath73 .",
    "this situation is very different at the pole position .",
    "since only the resonance part of the total amplitude contains a pole , a model - dependent resonance - background separation is unnecessary .",
    "therefore , the pole positions and also the residues are model independent .",
    "however , they can suffer from uncertainties arising from the analytical continuation of the amplitudes , determined from data on the real energy axis , into the lower part of the complex energy plane .",
    "finding the pole positions and the residues of baryon resonances can be a difficult task .",
    "some first attempts , applied to @xmath74 scattering amplitudes , were carried out by hhler  @xcite and cutkosky  @xcite .",
    "the optimal method would be an analytic continuation into the complex plane , within a dynamical and analytical model , carefully considering all branch cuts from open channels , that generally produce many poles on different riemann sheets , where only the pole closest to the physical axis is relevant .",
    "in many cases , however , this is not possible in practice , e.g. when partial wave amplitudes can only be evaluated on the physical axis . for these cases , hhler proposed the speed - plot technique  @xcite , which was later extended by the regularization method  @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we apply the laurent - plus - pietarinen method ( l+p ) based on separation of pole and regular part , and using the conformal mapping variable to expand the regular part in power series ; the method which has proven to be most reliable and has been applied to different processes  @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of the l+p method is the fact that it is a global method , describing the amplitudes over a wide energy range , treating threshold effects in terms of physical and effective branch points .",
    "most other methods use only partial wave information in a local region around the relevant resonance position .    in this study , we have adopted the multi - channel laurent - plus - pietarinen method ( mc l+p ) , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the single - channel case where the @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 multipoles must be treated simultaneously as they share the same pole with associated @xmath74 resonance coupling .",
    "one could therefore describe the method as a coupled - multipole laurent - plus - pietarinen method ( cm l+p ) .",
