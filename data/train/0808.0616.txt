    "quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) in metals are a fascinating field of today s condensed matter research.@xcite heavy - fermion materials play a prominent role : frequently , one observes non - fermi liquid behavior which is thought to be associated with an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) instability of the itinerant electrons . the critical spin fluctuations near the phase transition lead to unconventional power laws in transport and thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures .",
    "on the theory side , a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) description of the critical magnetic degrees of freedom , developed by hertz,@xcite moriya,@xcite , and millis@xcite accounts for many of the experimental signatures of magnetic criticality .",
    "however , some heavy - fermion compounds do not easily fit in the lgw picture in @xmath4 spatial dimensions .",
    "for cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 , it was realized@xcite that most thermodynamic signatures of the qpt at @xmath5 are consistent with the assumption of the underlying afm spin fluctuations to be 2d .",
    "it came as a surprise that 2d spin fluctuations should prevail in an intrinsically 3d alloy , but the 2d character was subsequently confirmed in neutron - scattering experiments.@xcite importantly , the afm order observed in cecu@xmath0au@xmath1  below the nel temperature is fully 3d . on general grounds ,",
    "one thus expects a dimensional crossover within the paramagnetic phase from 2d magnetic fluctuations at elevated temperatures to 3d fluctuations at lowest temperatures or in the immediate vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "experimentally , the dimensional crossover in cecu@xmath0au@xmath1  has proven to be elusive so far .    a related heavy - fermion metal ,",
    "not easily fitting the lgw theory framework , is ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2.@xcite it shows a phase transition to an ordered phase at 70  mk , which is believed to be afm , however , a confirmation by neutron scattering is not available to date .",
    "an additional aspect is that ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2  seems to be almost ferromagnetic ( fm),@xcite and we will return to this issue later in this paper .",
    "the unusual properties of both cecu@xmath0au@xmath1  and ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2  have prompted speculations on the inapplicability of the lgw theory , which describes a magnetic instability of well - defined quasiparticles : instead , it was proposed that the kondo effect , being responsible for the formation of the heavy quasiparticles , breaks down at the quantum critical point ( qcp).@xcite different scenarios and theoretical descriptions of this kondo breakdown have been put forward.@xcite the scenario of so - called `` local quantum criticality''@xcite uses an extension of dynamical mean - field theory to map the kondo - lattice problem to a self - consistent impurity model where the kondo effect may be suppressed by critical bulk spin fluctuations . this particular scenario for a kondo - breakdown qcp requires the spin fluctuations to be 2d ; for 3d spin fluctuations this model predicts a conventional magnetic qcp of lgw type .",
    "as the critical spin fluctuations of the material can again be expected to become 3d at low energies , the local quantum criticality should be restricted to elevated temperatures or energies above the dimensional crossover .",
    "other examples of layered metals with magnetic qcp are the heavy fermions cemin@xmath3 ( m = co , rh , ir ) , the high - temperature superconducting cuprates and iron pnictides , and the metamagnetic ruthenate sr@xmath2ru@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study theoretically the dimensional crossover of critical magnetic fluctuations in the framework of the lgw model , with focus on the 2d afm to 3d afm and 2d fm to 3d afm crossovers .",
    "microscopically , we imagine a system of planes of interacting electrons , with tendency toward antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic in - plane ordering , and a weak antiferromagnetic inter - plane coupling",
    ". we will study how the dimensional crossover is reflected in the correlation length , specific heat , thermal expansion , compressibility , and the grneisen parameter.@xcite our primary goal is to identify observables which are suited for an experimental search for a dimensional crossover .    in this paper , we shall refrain from a detailed microscopic modeling of the magnetic inter - plane coupling . the underlying lattice geometry and bandstructure will influence some of the non - universal properties of the dimensional crossover ; however , the existence of well - defined 2d and 3d regimes is independent of those details .",
    "we shall ignore complications arising from the possibility of the inter - plane coupling being frustrated:@xcite even for a fully frustrated coupling , a dimensional crossover to 3d behavior at low energies will generically occur , albeit with a possibly small crossover scale.@xcite ( in situations with frustration , the effective 3d coupling within the ordered phase may be enhanced due to order - from - disorder mechanisms . )",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to the framework of the lgw theory of itinerant spin fluctuations .",
    "it has been discussed that this approach may break down at lowest energies due to the occurrence of singular terms in the lgw expansion ( i ) for ferromagnets in both 2d and 3d,@xcite and ( ii ) for 2d antiferromagnets.@xcite these complications will be ignored for simplicity , a justification being that the low - energy behavior of our model is invariably 3d afm ( where the lgw approach is believed to be valid).@xcite our theory may also be combined with the ideas of local quantum criticality,@xcite this is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "generally , the behavior changes from 2d to 3d upon approaching criticality .    however , the fact that the qpt under consideration are at or above their upper critical dimension renders naive scaling invalid ; as a result , the quantum critical regime is characterized by _ two _ distinct length scales : the physical correlation length @xmath20 and a thermal length given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the temperature and @xmath23 the dynamical exponent . the presence of two length scales results in two types of dimensional crossovers .",
    "a dimensional crossover in the quantum critical fluctuations occurs upon approaching the qcp either by lowering the temperature @xmath22 or decreasing the tuning parameter @xmath24 ; these crossovers are indicated by the horizontal and vertical shaded regions in figs .",

    "for example , the specific heat coefficient at criticality , @xmath29 , changes its temperature dependence at the crossover temperature , @xmath30 , from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , as expected for critical thermodynamics of 2d and 3d af fluctuations , respectively .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the 2d fm to 3d afm crossover , due to the mismatch of dynamical exponents in the two regimes .",
    "the low dimensionality , @xmath33 , of the fm spin fluctuations combined with a large dynamical exponent , @xmath34 , result in strong thermodynamic signatures of the 2d regime , which dominate over the 3d afm fluctuations in an unexpectedly wide regime .",
    "for example , at criticality , @xmath29 , the 2d fm fluctuations yield singular quantum critical thermodynamics down to a temperature scale @xmath35 , where @xmath34 .",
    "below this temperature scale , the thermal activation of these 2d fluctuations only yields fermi - liquid behavior , but this is still much stronger than the contribution from the 3d part of the spin - fluctuation spectrum . only at a much lower temperature scale , @xmath36",
    ", the contributions from the 3d afm fluctuations finally take over .",
    "thus , we have here the peculiar situation that a 2d non - critical fermi - liquid regime is sandwiched between the 2d and 3d quantum critical regions .      in addition",
    ", there is a dimensional crossover associated with classical criticality . upon approaching the classical phase transition line , @xmath8 , the correlation length @xmath20 increases . if @xmath20 reaches @xmath37 , the classical fluctuations ( i.e. those associated with zero matsubara frequency ) effectively change their dimensionality from 2d to 3d .",
    "this classical dimensional crossover occurs _ within _ the 2d quantum critical regime at the shaded line labeled @xmath9 in figs .",
    "[ fig : pd - afaf ] and [ fig : pd - fmaf ] , and it also causes thermodynamic signatures . for example , the thermal expansion @xmath38 has a maximum at @xmath39 for the 2d fm to 3d afm crossover . at higher temperature @xmath12 , the crossover line @xmath39 enters the ginzburg regime of the classical transition , and the classical dimensional crossover becomes non - perturbative .",
    "the phase boundary , @xmath8 , of the classical transition is linear in the distance to the qcp at elevated temperatures ( with logarithmic corrections ) , but curves towards the qcp in the 3d regime . as a consequence , an extrapolation of the quasi - linear phase boundary in the 2d regime towards zero temperature yields an incorrect position for the qcp ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : asd ] , and we estimate the corresponding error between the extrapolated and the true position of the qpt .    we note that our treatment of thermodynamics is limited to the non - ordered side of the phase transition and , in particular , breaks down upon entering the ginzburg regime of the classical critical transition indicated by the thin line @xmath11 in figs .",
    "[ fig : pd - afaf ] and [ fig : pd - fmaf ] .",
    "as detailed below , we find that the thermal expansion and the compressibility are well suited to detect a dimensional crossover in the spin - fluctuation spectrum .",

    "as the pressure dependence of all microscopic parameters is smooth , singular contributions to thermodynamics usually arise only through the pressure dependence of @xmath24 in the vicinity of the qcp .",
    "however , in our model , the 2d regime possesses another relevant parameter , namely the anisotropy @xmath127 .",
    "if the anisotropy also depends on pressure , it will give important additional contributions to thermal expansion and compressibility in the 2d regime .",

    "having this in mind , we omit a further discussion of these terms in the following sections .",
    "given all these caveats , our calculations to be presented below are nevertheless valuable , for various reasons : ( a ) they illustrate the general structure of the phase diagram with the quantum and classical dimensional crossover lines , ( b ) they show the existence of the interesting intermediate regime where 2d quantum fluctuations coexist with 3d classical fluctuations , ( c ) they show which observables are especially sensitive to the dimensional crossover and how `` broad '' or `` narrow '' the crossover signatures are expected to be , and ( d ) they show where logarithmic corrections can dominate power laws .",
    "let us briefly comment on aspect ( ii ) , namely whether all observables display the same crossover scale . for thermodynamics , there is a single relevant momentum crossover scale @xmath124 , at least in our simple model without inter - layer frustration .",
    "the single momentum scale however translates into various temperature scales , and depending on the thermodynamic quantity of interest different crossover scales might be of importance . for the 2d ",

    "these multiple crossover temperatures result in rich thermodynamics and render the extraction of power laws especially difficult .",

    "in addition to the momentum scale @xmath124 , there are characteristic length scales for transport scattering processes . for coupled chains ,",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the interplay of those length and time scales can render transport fully three - dimensional even in a regime where the thermodynamic behavior is 1d .",
    "hence , thermodynamic and transport crossovers do not have to coincide in general .",
    "for materials consisting of antiferromagnetic planes , which itself are weakly coupled in the third direction , a scenario of a crossover from 2d antiferromagnetism to 3d antiferromagnetism is plausible .",

    "<S> in such a situation , physical properties will display , upon decreasing temperature or energy , a dimensional crossover from two - dimensional ( 2d ) to three - dimensional ( 3d ) behavior , which is particularly interesting near quantum criticality . </S>",
    "<S> here we study this crossover in thermodynamics using a suitably generalized landau - ginzburg - wilson approach to the critical behavior , combined with renormalization group techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on two experimentally relevant cases : the crossover from a 2d to a 3d antiferromagnet , and the crossover from a 2d ferromagnet to a 3d antiferromagnet . as naive scaling does not apply at and above the upper critical dimension , two crossover scales arise which can be associated with separate dimensional crossovers of classical and quantum fluctuations , respectively . in particular , we find an intermediate regime with novel power laws where the quantum fluctuations still have a 2d and the classical fluctuations already have a 3d character . for the ferromagnet - to - antiferromagnet crossover , the mismatch of the dynamical exponents between the 2d and 3d regimes leads to an even richer crossover structure , with an interesting 2d non - critical regime sandwiched between two critical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> for all cases , we find that thermal expansion and compressibility are particularly sensitive probes of the dimensional crossover . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we relate our results to experiments on the quantum critical heavy - fermion metals cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 , ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2 , and cecoin@xmath3 . </S>"
