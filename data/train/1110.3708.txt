    "it should be emphasized that the equivalence of @xmath0-symmetry and pseudo - hermiticity is yet to be established @xcite .",

    "the necessary realness of both spectra is ensured by supersymmetry .",
    "thus , a co - existence of both the symmetries is observed .",
    "recently , supersymmetric structure of certain @xmath0-symmetric systems has been considered to analyze the structure of the corresponding hilbert spaces , along with the parametric correspondence between the two @xcite .",
    "subsequently , correlation properties of @xmath0-symmetric systems have been studied , wherein it has been established that , @xmath0-symmetric systems are endowed with a conserved non - local correlation , which leads to physical implications regarding boundary conditions @xcite , in accord to the experimental results @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that certain interacting many - particle @xmath0-symmetric systems are transmission - less @xcite .",

    "it follows that the width of the well , which has to be real for the realness of the physical spectrum , can not be arbitrary .",

    "@xmath2 is the proposed ` norm / metric operator ' for the pseudo - hermitian systems @xcite .",
    "isospectral deformation has been utilized to construct many classes of @xmath0-symmetric systems , with definite understanding regarding the metric operator @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "we utilize ` general isospectral deformation ' to arrive at _ complex _ shift in coordinate of the ` real ' system , obtaining a map to a @xmath0-symmetric scarf - ii system , defined in real space with imaginary coordinate acting as a continuous parameter , subjected to the physical boundary conditions .",
    "this system has been studied under general parameterizations in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , a scheme of extending the isospectral family of potentials to include non - hermitian systems has been realized .",
    "a general treatment for non - hermitian systems isospectral to hermitian systems is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the paper has been organized as follows .",
    "section i contains a brief summary of isospectral deformation leading to the solutions of the bernoulli s equation . section ii deals with the family of equivalent superpotentials corresponding to 1-d particle in an infinite box and that the resulting isospectral family of potentials necessarily require complexification of space and discretization of the well width .",
    "section iii contains a generalized treatment of 1-d infinite well in complex plane , emphasizing on the importance of boundary conditions necessary for physical results .",
    "section iv analyzes the @xmath0-symmetric potentials , isospectrally constructed from the generalized particle in a box , and also the parametric conditions leading to spontaneous breaking of @xmath0-symmetry , thus shedding light on its effect on the isospectrality . in conclusion ,",
    "the accumulated understanding of these generalized systems will be discussed , along with the prospects for future works .",
    "given a potential leading to a factorizable hamiltonian , the corresponding superpotential is not unique . however , different superpotentials correspond to different isospectral partners of the unchanged potential in general . such modification of the superpotential is known as the isospectral deformation , and evidently in this way , a family of superpartners can be constructed for a given potential .",
    "an isospectral pair of potential is conventionally written as ,    @xmath3      @xmath19    with a new superpartner ,    @xmath20    the physically acceptable solution @xmath18 of the bernoulli s equation ( eq.[2 ] ) , for a given @xmath4 , is determined by the normalizability of the eigenfunctions corresponding to @xmath8 .",
    "the free particle corresponds to a constant superpotential @xmath21 , the corresponding constant potential @xmath22 can always be absorbed in defining the origin of energy .",
    "the corresponding bernoulli s equation reads as ,    @xmath23    with the solution ,    @xmath24    with @xmath25 being the constant of integration .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 is a constant , leads to the riccati equation : @xmath26 for the superpotential , having unique solution modulo an additive constant .",
    "though it is trivial in this particular case , it ensures uniqueness of @xmath18 too .",
    "the new superpotential @xmath27 , which will henceforth be called @xmath28 , generically marks location of boundaries , and leads to a _ new _ superpartner ,",
    "@xmath29    it is to be emphasized that the presence of infinite boundaries at finite interval generally modifies a constant superpotential to a local function , as in the case of 1-d infinite box , reflected in the expression of the ground state in terms of the superpotential , @xmath30 $ ] , with @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the location of the boundaries .",
    "the functional form of the potential ( @xmath7 ) by itself does not contain information of the boundary conditions , but the superpotential does , as it determines the ground sate eigenfunction .",
    "thus , through isospectral deformation , only the value of @xmath7 is unchanged , not the system boundaries .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the ground state wave function for @xmath11 in terms of the new superpotential is ,    @xmath33    which must be same as that for @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ , sinusoidal with nodes only at the boundaries .",
    "this necessarily requires that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , yielding ,    @xmath37    the knowledge of the ground state of @xmath7 along with eq.[7 ] ensures the trivial physical choice of @xmath38 .",
    "this is the previously mentioned boundary value restriction from a potential ( @xmath7 ) to its superpartner ( @xmath8 ) , as evident from eq.[8 ] .",
    "however , we are motivated here to construct the most general form of @xmath8 , thus to generalize @xmath7 if necessary . keeping this in mind",
    ", we consider the integration constant @xmath25 to be complex in general .",
    "then , subjected to the boundary conditions that the eigenfunction vanishes at @xmath32 , one obtains from eq.[7 ] ,    @xmath39    thereby necessitating @xmath32 to be _",
    "complex_. the above equation also ensures the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be @xmath42 , with @xmath43 being an integer .",
    "therefore , we end up generalizing the 1-d infinite potential well with arbitrary width to an infinite 1-d potential well in the complex @xmath6 plane , placed parallel to the real axes , with _ real _ ` quantized ' width . that this choice is the most general one ,",
    "is explicated in sec.iii .",
    "thus , @xmath7 can correspond to different infinite wells subjected to different combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenvalues , however , are still real as they depend only on @xmath45 , which is real , but can have different values now .",
    "hence , we have isospectrally related a _ family _",
    "of 1-d infinite wells to a family of complex potentials , which will be discussed next .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    for mathematical and intuitive convenience , we redefine the variable(s ) as ,    @xmath46    then , one can re - write @xmath47 $ ] in terms of the new variables . now , the potential in eq.[8 ] can be written as @xmath48 , which can be re - organized in the form ,    @xmath49,\\label{11}\\ ] ]    with real and imaginary parts well - separated .",
    "fig [ rev ] shows the plots of @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a function of @xmath52 , showing the former to be even and the later to be odd in @xmath52 .",
    "this ensures @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath8 , provided we define parity transformation in the complex @xmath6-plane to be @xmath53 .",
    "this is sensible also from the point of view that the _ generalized _ potential wells are actually manifested through the shift of the origin , as far as the invoked complexity of the coordinate @xmath6 is concerned .",
    "the variable @xmath54 acts as a continuous parameter extending from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , same as @xmath44 and @xmath25 , while the variable @xmath52 is restricted by boundary conditions for the well .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    hamiltonians in complex coordinate plane have been extensively studied in classical domain @xcite , wherein multiple trajectories , along with the shifted ` usual ' real space trajectories ( straight lines ) , leads to the _ same _ probability in corresponding quantum systems @xcite .",
    "these have different sets of ` classical turning points ' with the possibility of ` classical tunneling ' @xcite . here",
    ", we stick to the shifted ` usual ' trajectory for the infinite well , which is fixed parallel to the @xmath52 axis by the physical boundary conditions to be explicated in the next section .",
    "subsequently , @xmath8 is confined in real space only , with @xmath54 serving as a continuous parameter .",
    "in order to obtain an isospectral map to @xmath0-symmetric system of @xmath8 in real space , by generalizing a hamiltonian system ( the 1-d infinite box ) to the complex plane , we need @xmath54 to be at best a continuous parameter , whereas @xmath52 is the direction along which parity transformation has to be executed . here",
    ", one expects the motion of the particle in the infinite well to remain confined to the real axis , for the spectra of the system to be real , requiring the _ quantized _ widths of the well to be real .",
    "this requirement makes the treatment fundamentally different from complex canonical transformation in the _ phase _ space , utilized to study @xmath0-symmetric systems earlier @xcite , obtaining a ` new ' hamiltonian with real spectra .",
    "here , we do a position - coordinate or ` point ' transformation by taking the hermitian system to complex plane , and then obtain @xmath0-symmetric systems through isospectral deformation .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    we begin by considering the 1-d infinite box to be oriented in the complex plane @xmath57 $ ] in arbitrary direction instead of parallel to the @xmath52-axis .",
    "consequently , the generalized boundary conditions for the eigenfunction will be @xmath58 , with coordinates in the bracket representing the infinite boundary . now , the 2-d dalembertian , @xmath59 is defined in the complex coordinate plane , yielding the klein - gordon - type eigenvalue equation ,    @xmath60    on separation of variables as @xmath61 , one obtains ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a constant and the prime denotes derivative with respect to the respective variables .",
    "the individual solutions are :    @xmath64    here @xmath65 and @xmath66 are complex numbers and @xmath67 .",
    "we identify that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are the momenta along respective axes .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the second one of eq.[17 ] is what one obtains considering a 1-d free particle in imaginary space . in that case , @xmath70 is _ real _ as the space is considered to be imaginary .",
    "if one considers the variable of differentiation to be @xmath71 , instead of @xmath54 , we end up with imaginary momentum .",
    "these are two equivalent pictures of a 1-d free particle in imaginary space , which can also be seen as a 1-d particle moving in a constant potential @xmath72 , @xmath73 being the total energy of the particle , known to have exponentially decaying solutions .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    on plugging in the boundary conditions @xmath58 in eq . [ 18 ] , we obtain ,    @xmath74    yielding ,    @xmath75    as @xmath76 , @xmath70 , @xmath52 and @xmath54 are all real , the only sensible conclusion is @xmath77 , implying @xmath78 .",
    "thus the box is parallel to the real axis and the particle is constrained to move in 1-d .",
    "the identification @xmath69 , owing to the explicit consideration @xmath79 , ensures the ` physicality ' of the hermitian system ( 1-d infinite well ) that it has real spectra with the wave - function decaying exponentially along @xmath54 , with proper choice of coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath66 in eq.[18 ] . this is a general result , owing to both the imaginary nature of one variable and the infinite boundary .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    the above problem can equivalently be cast as one in the @xmath81 space ( @xmath82 ) ( the @xmath83 minkowski space ) , where the conserved scalar is @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding conserved scalar in the fourier space is @xmath85 , with the metric @xmath86 or @xmath87 , where the space is essentially considered to be real .",
    "we adopted the notation of the equivalent metric @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , with explicit consideration that the space is complex .",
    "this leads to the conserved scalar @xmath84 same as that in the @xmath83 minkowski space , but now that in the fourier / momentum space is @xmath90 .",
    "thus under the @xmath89 metric , either space ( 1-d component ) can be real or the corresponding momenta , but not both , if the complete space is complex .",
    "the essence to carry forward here is that in the present problem , the complexness of space is not avoidable as the @xmath89 metric is unique , and hence the imaginary component of the space is _ not _ an artifact , removable by choice of metric , unlike the @xmath81 case .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath11 is still real , which can be verified in the usual manner by considering the general plane wave solution @xmath91 to vanish at complex values @xmath32 , leading to @xmath92 with @xmath93 being real .",
    "this , through isospectrality , necessarily demands the spectrum of @xmath8 to be real . but being @xmath0-symmetric , @xmath8 also has complex - conjugate spectra when the @xmath0-symmetry breaks spontaneously .",
    "thus the isospectrality with the complex infinite well should persist only till the @xmath0-symmetry is preserved . to analyze the complete spectra of @xmath8",
    ", we seek to solve the eigenvalue problem for @xmath94 . for convenience ,",
    "we consider the form in eq.[8 ] , leading to the eigenfunctions @xcite :    @xmath95    modulo a normalization constant . on considering eq .",
    "[ 10 ] , the above equation can be rewritten as :    @xmath96\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left[\\sin\\{(n+1)\\xi\\}\\cosh\\{(n+1)\\eta\\}+\\mathbf{i}\\cos\\{(n+1)\\xi\\}\\sinh\\{(n+1)\\eta\\}\\right]\\left[\\sin(\\xi)\\cosh(\\eta)-\\mathbf{i}\\cos(\\xi)\\sinh(\\eta)\\right]^{-1}\\label{13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    clearly , these eigenfunctions are @xmath0-symmetric with respect to @xmath52 modulo a shift @xmath97 of the origin .",
    "this is in accord with the property of isospectral @xmath0-symmetric potentials that unique superpotential leads to unbroken @xmath0-symmetric sector , as observed in @xcite , unless any further symmetry is involved @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    from eqs [ 11 ] and [ 13 ] , it is also evident that both @xmath8 and @xmath98 remain @xmath0-symmetric subjected to the alternative choice of parity transformation : @xmath99 , with @xmath52 acting as a continuous parameter ( fig [ rev1 ] ) .",
    "however , this will not correspond to a particle in an infinite box directly , as such a system can not exist parallel to the imaginary axis . therefore",
    ", no alteration of the parameters can lead to a spontaneously broken @xmath0-symmetric regime at this stage .",
    "naturally , there exists a more general form of @xmath8 , which reduces to that in eq.[11 ] under certain parametric condition , preserving @xmath0-symmetry spontaneously @xcite . to obtain the same , instead of @xmath27 ,",
    "we propose a superpotential :    @xmath100    leading to ,    @xmath101    the potential in eq.[8 ] corresponds to a particular choice @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for @xmath104 and @xmath103",
    ", the system will not map to a free particle ( in or out of the box ! ) as @xmath105 with ground state wave function @xmath106 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath107 are shape - invariant @xcite and hence , can be solved exactly using the susy algebra .",
    "the spectrum turns out to be @xmath108 @xcite , which is real .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-symmetry is still preserved . on the other hand , for @xmath104 and @xmath109 ,",
    "it is known @xcite that there exists a spontaneously broken @xmath0-symmetric phase , with complex - conjugate pairs of discrete , yet finite eigenvalues , even for @xmath110 .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    therefore , in the complex space , the free particle in infinite 1-d box isospectrally maps to a restricted portion ( @xmath111 ) of the parametric domain for spontaneously preserved @xmath0-symmetry of the potential in eq.[15 ] .",
    "such results were known earlier @xcite for specific @xmath0-symmetric potentials obeying susy - qm .",
    "isospectral deformation plays a distinct role in the present case , by bringing out the most general form of the superpotential corresponding to a constant potential .",
    "generic complexification yielded the @xmath0-symmetric potential , isospectral to the free particle in a _ real _",
    "1-d infinite box , embedded in the complex space .",
    "the fact that the real spectrum of a @xmath0-symmetric potential can be mapped to that of a much simpler potential through suitable generalization of the space enables us to intuitively picture why the spectrum of such a potential is real , even without hermiticity , due to isospectrality to a hermitian system . here",
    ", we have extended the domain of such analogy through generic complexification of the space .",
    "this might be helpful to visualize the real spectrum of other @xmath0-symmetric potentials . also , this could serve as an alternative to constructing a new scalar product to explain the real spectrum of these complex potentials , by attributing the realness of the spectrum to parametric isospectrality",
    ". it will be worthwhile to analyze the algebraic structure of the corresponding scattering states @xcite , and inquire about presence of spectral singularities @xcite corresponding to such isospectral pair of potentials",
