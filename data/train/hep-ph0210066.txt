    "the physics of neutrino oscillation is currently under very active investigation , since it leads to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "two - flavor neutrino oscillation , however , is adopted in most analyses of the data , although everyone knows that there are three active neutrino flavors .",
    "two - flavor oscillation is easy to investigate in comparison with three - flavor oscillation because there are only two parameters : a mass - squared difference and a mixing angle .",
    "in addition , some exact solutions of the oscillation probability are known in the two - flavor oscillation scheme even in the presence of a matter effect @xcite . to make the analysis realistic",
    ", however , we need to work in the full three - flavor system , where we have six parameters , two mass - squared differences , three mixing angles , and one cp phase .",
    "the analysis using three - flavor oscillation is particularly important when we compare the outputs from different experiments , sensitive to different mass - squared differences and mixing angles .",
    "the importance of the analysis in the full three - flavor context for terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to investigate the three - flavor oscillation is by relying on a numerical calculation .",
    "there is no serious technical difference between the two - flavor oscillation and the three - flavor one in numerical calculations .",
    "the parameter space , however , becomes very large , six dimensional , and is difficult to exhaust .",
    "what is worse , we can not easily understand the physical consequences from the numerical results intuitively , even if the parameter space is exhausted .    a more elegant way to investigate",
    "the three - flavor oscillation is to reduce the three - flavor oscillation to an effective two - flavor one using the hierarchy between the two mass differences or the smallness of some mixing angle .",
    "for example , the following reduction formula for the survival probability of the electron neutrino , @xmath0 is found in the case that one mass difference is much larger than the other one and the matter effect , @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the mixing angle defined in sec .",
    "[ onenext ] , while @xmath4 is the survival rate calculated in the effective two - flavor scheme with effective matter effect @xmath5 .",
    "we show the definitions of each quantity in detail in sec .",
    "this relation is often used in the analysis of the solar neutrino @xcite .",
    "although it is exact in the limit @xmath6 , the actual hierarchy is not so good .",
    "taking the large mixing angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( lma - msw ) solution for the solar neutrino problem and the allowed range of @xmath7 from the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , we find that the hierarchies are rather mild , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that the above relation possibly has an error around several percents or more .",
    "such an error is not so important in just verifying the existence of the neutrino masses .",
    "current interest in neutrino physics is , however , not only in verifying the finite masses but also in determining the precise values of the parameters .",
    "the allowed region of the mass differences and the mixing angles may be affected due to error in the formula used in the analysis .",
    "this error would be more serious in attempts to observe the cp violation in the leptonic sector using the sizes of the unitarity triangle , since it requires a more precise determination of the survival rate @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to examine how precise the reduction formula is .",
    "we then propose a next - to - leading order reduction formula , which is surprisingly precise .",
    "we assume only the mass hierarchy @xmath8 and do not impose any restriction on @xmath3 in order to keep our analysis as general as possible . while we average the survival rate with respect to the final time , we do not average it with respect to the initial time .",
    "the reduction formula obtained therefore can be used without averaging over the initial time .",
    "another example of the reduction formula is the following relation for two successive resonances @xcite : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the mixing angle defined in sec .",
    "[ onenext ] , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the jump probabilities for resonances with lower and higher number densities , respectively . this relation is used for the investigation into neutrino oscillation inside a supernova , which has two successive resonances due to the high matter density @xcite .",
