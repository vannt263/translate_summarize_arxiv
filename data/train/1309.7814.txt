    "type iip supernovae ( sn  iip ) represent majority of core - collapse events in the mass range of @xmath8 ( heger et al . 2003 ) . despite the explosion mechanism",
    "is not well understood , the major observational characteristics of sn  iip indicate that we deal with the red supergiant ( rsg ) explosion ( grassberg et al .",
    "1971 ; falk & arnett 1977 ; eastman et al .",
    "1994 ; baklanov et al . 2005 ; utrobin 2007 ) .",
    "yet detailed modelling of eight well observed sn  iip uncovers a serious problem that progenitor masses of all of them turn out to be significantly larger @xmath9 compared to the lower limit ( @xmath10 ) of massive stars ( utrobin & chugai 2013 , henceforth uc13 ) .",
    "although this sample is small and selection effects might skew the distribution , this fact poses a difficult question , whether we understand adequately the sn  iip light curve and spectrum formation .",
    "recently , modelling the type iip supernova sn  2008 in revealed an unexpected problem , namely , that h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 line profiles can not be described simultaneously in the spherically - symmetric model ( uc13 ) .",
    "specifically , h@xmath1 absorption turns out to be substantially deeper compared to the prediction based on the model adjusted to h@xmath0 .",
    "the problem seems to be rather serious keeping in mind simplicity of the hydrogen spectrum and the fact that the balmer lines have the common lower level . in that paper",
    "we suggested that the inconsistency between h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 could be an outcome of an inhomogeneous structure of supernova envelope in outer layers .",
    "here we explore a possibility for the solution of the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem in sn  2008 in by assuming the inhomogeneous ( clumpy ) matter distribution in outer layers of supernova .",
    "we confine ourselves to the question , whether one could find an acceptable description of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 profiles assuming a clumpy atmosphere , and , if so , what should be the optimal parameters of the inhomogeneous structure .",
    "we start with a description of h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem using the model with a smooth density distribution ( section 2 ) .",
    "we then present the inhomogeneous model and results of the modelling for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 line profiles ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we consider the issue of flux fluctuations in the h@xmath0 line related to the inhomogeneous structure .",
    "our study is based on spectra of sn  2008 in published by roy et al .",
    "we consider a freely expanding spherical envelope with the lagrangian velocity and radius obeyed the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the time since the explosion .",
    "a photosphere is presumably sharp and resides at the level @xmath13 ; above that level the atmosphere is transparent in the continuum . for the moderate h@xmath0 optical depth ( @xmath14 ) the size of the scattering region of a photon is of the order of the sound scale length @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 is the hydrogen thermal velocity ) . given @xmath17 , the sobolev approximation for the local photon scattering is valid with the high precision . the line profile formed in the supernova envelope",
    "is determined by the behavior of the local optical depth @xmath18 and source function @xmath19 .",
    "since we are interested in the relative flux , in case of the uniform brightness @xmath20 of the photosphere the source function can be written in the dimensionless form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dilution factor .",
    "the first term is for the scattering of photospheric radiation and the second term is for the intrinsic emission .",
    "the power law is adopted for the optical depth @xmath23 and for the source function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are values at the photosphere .    in fig .",
    "1 we show two versions of models for sn  2008 in on day 11 . the first one is aimed at reproducing h@xmath0 , whereas the second at reproducing h@xmath1 . the photospheric velocity is 6100 km s@xmath3 in both cases .",
    "the plots show that the model being good for the h@xmath0 is bad for h@xmath1 .",
    "two possibilities for h@xmath1 are shown : without and with the net emission . in both cases",
    "the fit is bad . on the other hand ,",
    "the model aimed at the description of h@xmath1 does not reproduce h@xmath0 .",
    "this modelling demonstrates the core of the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem in the early spectrum of sn  2008 in : the lines can not be reproduced simultaneously in the model of the smooth spherically - symmetric envelope .",
    "to put it staightforwardly , the h@xmath1 absorption is stronger than that in the model based on h@xmath0 .",
    "the opposite is true as well : the h@xmath0 absorption is weaker than that in the model based on the h@xmath1 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this controversy can not be resolved by taking metal lines into account because at this stage metal lines are very weak and can not markedly affect hydrogen line profiles .",
    "we explored the effects of a multiple thomson scattering off thermal electrons taking into account the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 photons created at large optical depth @xmath27 .",
    "this mechanism is known to produce broad wings in balmer lines of some sn  iin ( chugai 2001 ) .",
    "our modelling shows however that for reasonable temperature ( @xmath28 k ) the effects of wings are negligible and can not resolve the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem anyway .",
    "arguments for the consideration of the inhomogeneous model stem from the fact that in the clumpy medium with the large cloud to intercloud contrast the line absorption depth is determined by both atomic constants and the cloud filling factor .",
    "the situation is conceivable when the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 absorptions in clouds are saturated . in this case , if the intercloud gas is absent , the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 absorption ratio could become close to unity , i.e. , significantly lower than the homogeneous model predicts .",
    "we suggest that the supernova atmosphere consists of an ensemble of dense clouds embedded in a rarefied intercloud medium .",
    "the inhomegeneous structure is characterized by the volume filling factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the average cloud number in a volume @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the average volume of a cloud .",
    "generally , @xmath33 is a function of the lagrangian radius . if a cloud size @xmath34 much larger than the size of a resonance region ( or sound radius ) @xmath35",
    ", the average total area of sections of clouds by a random plane ( resonance plane in our case ) with the area @xmath36 is equal @xmath37 according to the well - known theorem of geometrical probability ( kendal & moran 1963 ) . with this result ,",
    "the intensity of the escaping photospheric radiation ( neglecting emission component ) at the radial velocity @xmath38 , i.e. , at the frequency @xmath39 is @xmath40\\ , , \\label{eq - ffac}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the line optical depth of the cloud and @xmath42 is the optical depth in the intercloud medium .",
    "the expression in square brackets has a meaning of the attenuation factor ; it depends on the frequency and the radius . in the limit @xmath35",
    "this factor does not depend on the cloud size . in case of an emission component",
    "the effect of clumpiness can be calculated similar to the absorption component .",
    "as we will see below , to reproduce balmer lines , the inhomogeneity should be invoked only in the outermost layers .",
    "we therefore consider the smooth matter distribution ( @xmath43 ) in the inner envelope zone @xmath44 and the clumpy distribution in the outer zone ( @xmath45 ) assuming a power law for the radial variation @xmath46 in case of small clouds ( @xmath47 ) the relation ( [ eq - ffac ] ) is not generally applicable . using",
    "this expression would result in the error which can be estimated by the monte carlo ( mc ) technique . to this end",
    "we adopt a random distribution of spherical clouds with a radius @xmath48 in the envelope with the kinematics @xmath11 . for @xmath49",
    "we find that the attenuation factor calculated by mc coincides with the value found from the equation ( [ eq - ffac ] ) . in case of @xmath50",
    "the analytic formula gives the attenuation factor 8% larger than mc simulation ; for @xmath51 the difference is 23% .",
    "the analytic formula therefore is applicable in a broad range of cloud sizes @xmath52 .",
    "we start with the constant filling factor @xmath53 ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) for @xmath55 . in this case to sensibly describe balmer lines in sn  2008 in on day 11 , the whole atmosphere should be inhomogeneous , @xmath56 km s@xmath3",
    ". the optimal value of the filling factor should be @xmath57 to fit the h@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "yet the model @xmath58const fails to adequately describe simultaneously both the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines ( fig 2 ) .",
    "the shown model is transparent in the intercloud medium . introducing a finite absorption in the intercloud gas",
    "worsen the agreement .",
    "we conclude therefore that the model with constant filling factor should be abandoned .    assuming a variable filling factor permits us to easily come to the optimal model describing both balmer lines ( figs .",
    "2c , d , model d11 in table ) .",
    "table contains the velocity at the photosphere derived from h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 [ @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the velocity at the inner boundary of the inhomogeneous zone ( @xmath61 ) , the optical depth of clouds ( @xmath41 ) and intercloud gas ( @xmath42 ) in the h@xmath0 at @xmath62 , power law index @xmath63 in the @xmath64 relation , power law index @xmath65 in the @xmath66 relation , and power law index @xmath67 in the equation ( [ eq - filf ] ) . an interesting point of our results is the relatively weak radial dependence of the population of the hydrogen second level @xmath68 compared to total density @xmath69 in the hydrodynamic model of sn  2008 in ( uc13 ) .",
    "a similar remark refers to the flat behavior of the source function @xmath70const .",
    "both facts indicate the enhanced excitation of hydrogen compared to the case when the excitation by the photospheric radiation dominates .",
    "the inhomogeneous zone in our model extends as deep as the photosphere @xmath56 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this poses a question , whether the inhomogeneous structure extends to deeper layers . as to the situation on day 11",
    ", the density distribution of the sn  2008 in hydrodynamic model ( uc13 ) suggests that the mass of the inhomogeneous atmosphere ( @xmath71 km s@xmath3 ) turns out to be @xmath72 .",
    "this is only @xmath73 of the total mass of ejecta ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the mass of the inhomogeneous zone is a crucial observational constraint on the mechanism of the inhomogeneities formation in the outer layers of sn  iip .",
    "the possible clumpy structure in the inner layers ( @xmath75 km s@xmath3 ) can be studied using the spectrum of sn  2008 in on day 18 ( roy et al . 2011 ) when the photosphere is deeper than on day 11 .",
    "we thus can check whether the inhomogeneous structure at @xmath75 km s@xmath3 is needed in order to describe h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 at this stage .",
    "first , however , we answer the question whether the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem retains on day 18 in the homogeneous model .    unlike previous epoch",
    ", the spectrum on day 18 shows rather strong metal lines which could affect hydrogen line profiles .",
    "we therefore should calculate the spectrum taking into account metal lines .",
    "the list of @xmath76 lines in the spectral range 3500 - 10000    for the condition of supergiant with the temperature of 7000  k has been retrieved from the vald database ( kupka et al .",
    "1999 ) . from this list",
    "we select lines in the range of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 with the optical depth @xmath77 at the photosphere for the excitation temperature of 7000  k. we assume that in metal lines the radiation is scattered with a finite absorption probability ( @xmath78 ) taken to be the same for all metal lines . in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines",
    "we take into account both scattering and emission .",
    "level populations are not in equilibrium which poses some problem . fortunately , in the h@xmath0 band siii 6347 , 6371   doublet dominates , while in the h@xmath1 band feii multiplet 42 prevails which facilitates a search for the optimal model .",
    "ion abundances for adopted excitation temperature ( 7000  k ) are adjusted using different correction factors for iron peak elements , si , and hydrogen .",
    "the modelling shows ( fig .",
    "3 ) that to reproduce the h@xmath1 line , the hydrogen second level population should be larger by a factor of three than that recovered from the h@xmath0 . remarkably , the similar factor value is needed to reproduce the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines on day 11 using the smooth model ( uc13 ) .",
    "the modelling demonstrates that the problem of the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 disparity retains on day 18 in the model of smooth density distribution .",
    "the question left to answer is whether the clumpy model for day 11 is applicable to day 18 .",
    "first , however , we comment an interesting fact which was missing formerly in available analysis of sn  iip spectra .",
    "the point is that on day 18 , unlike the earlier phase , the velocity at the photosphere measured from the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 turns out to be different : 4200 km s@xmath3 and 4700 km s@xmath3 respectively . at first glance",
    "the value derived from the h@xmath1 with a low net emission is more confident than that derived from the h@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , feii 4924 , 5018 , 5169   lines ( multiplet 42 ) confirm the value found from h@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "3a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity of 4200 km s@xmath3 obtained from h@xmath0 is consistent with the siii 6347 , 6371   doublet ( fig .",
    "3b ) which also rules out larger velocity ( @xmath79 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the photosphere indeed lies at different levels in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 bands : it is deeper for the h@xmath0 than for the h@xmath1 .",
    "we believe that this difference is related to the fact that the contribution of metal lines in the quasi - continuum is larger in the h@xmath1 band compared to the h@xmath0 band .",
    "the velocity at the photosphere around day 20 in these bands could become a valuable constraint on the model of sn  iip based on the multi - group radiation transfer .",
    "we turn now to the modelling of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 on day 18 taking into account inhomogeneities in the envelope .",
    "the same model of the inhomogeneous structure is used as on day 11 .",
    "parameters of the optimal model d18 are given in table .",
    "the calculated profiles for this model fit the observations well enough . in this model",
    "the photospheric velocities in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines are 4100 km s@xmath3 and 5300 km s@xmath3 respectively which qualitatively agree with the velocities found in the smooth model .",
    "remarkably , parameters of the inhomogeneous structure seem to be the same on days 11 and 18 with the exception that the intercloud optical depth on day 18 is a bit lower , 1.5 instead of 2 , which is in line with the excitation decrease demonstrated by the spectra .",
    "the fact that parameters of the inhomogeneous structure did not change noticeably means that inhomogeneity scales evolve homologously @xmath80 which in turn indicates the early formation of the inhomogeneous structure perhaps at the shock breakout stage .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission in the inhomogeneous model originates from dense clumps .",
    "one should expect therefore the presence of flux fluctuations in the emission component .",
    "the detection of these fluctuations could become a test for the inhomogeneous structure .",
    "a rough estimate of the fluctuation amplitude can be obtained assuming the poisson distribution of clouds . in this case",
    "the amplitude of the flux fluctuations in the range of radial velocities @xmath81 is equal @xmath82 , where @xmath30 is the number of clouds that contribute to the line radiation flux @xmath83 in this velocity range @xmath84 here @xmath33 is the volume filling factor of clouds , @xmath48 is the average cloud radius , @xmath13 is the velocity at the photosphere . in the observed spectrum on day 11",
    "the amplitude of flux fluctuations in the h@xmath0 profile is approximately @xmath85% .",
    "the number of clouds in the layer with the width corresponding to the spectral resolution @xmath86 km s@xmath3 should be thus @xmath87 . with this value the equation ( [ eq - fluc ] ) results in the cloud radius @xmath88 km s@xmath3 assuming @xmath89 and @xmath90 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the characteristic size of inhomogeneities is thus @xmath91 km s@xmath3 , if the fluctuations are actually related to the inhomogeneous structure .",
    "the poisson distribution however overestimates the fluctuation amplitude because it admits the cloud overlapping .",
    "this hardly occurs in reality since the inhomogeneities usually form in the process of fragmentation which basically suggests divergent flows . in order to avoid overlapping",
    ", we use the hard sphere model for the clouds ; a similar model was assumed for the analysis of fluctuations in the [ oi ] 6300   doublet in sn 1987a ( chugai 1994 ) .",
    "the cloud distribution is realised in several steps .",
    "first we place a sphere of a radius @xmath48 randomly in a cubic cell of the size @xmath92 with the filling factor @xmath33 being the function of velocity @xmath93 .",
    "cubic cells are placed in a spherical layer of a radius @xmath94 and the thickness of @xmath95 in the following way .",
    "the cells are placed one by one in a ring element @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the polar angle measured from @xmath98-axis which directed along the line of sight ) . in each other",
    "ring the initial random shift was introduced .",
    "each filled spherical layer is rotated on the random angle around @xmath99-axis which lies in the sky plane .",
    "the overall result is a random angular distribution of non - overlapping spherical clouds in the envelope . in the radial distribution",
    "the randomness presents only in the radial position of a sphere in each cell .",
    "the lack of a full chaos along the radius does not affect the result because we are interested only in a one - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional velocity space on the @xmath98-axis in a narrow interval around zero radial velocity ( @xmath100 ) . in this case",
    "the flux fluctuations in the h@xmath0 are not sensitive to the radial distribution of clouds .    with the obtained random distribution of spherical clouds in the supernova envelope we performed a set of computations for the velocity of 6100 km  s@xmath3 at the photosphere adopting the behavior of the source function and optical depth in clouds according to those found on day 11 .",
    "the derived line profile is convolved with the gaussian adopting the full width at half maximum of 300 km s@xmath3 to allow for the spectral resolution .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5a the calculated residual spectrum @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is heavily smoothed version of @xmath83 ) for two cases @xmath103 km s@xmath3 and @xmath104 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the comparison of these residuals with that for the observed spectrum of sn  2008 in on day 11 ( fig .",
    "5b ) permits us to constrain the scale of inhomogeneities .",
    "it is obvious that the inhomogeneities substantially larger than @xmath105 km s@xmath3 ( e.g. , 500 km s@xmath3 ) are rulled out because they predict too large fluctuations .",
    "the data do not rule out the cloud scales of @xmath106 km s@xmath3 .",
    "note that the observed fluctuations include not only fluctuations related to inhomogeneities but also other noise sources ( e.g. , photon noise , background noise , and device noise ) .",
    "the expected fluctuations related to the envelope inhomogeneous structure therefore are lower than 1% .",
    "this suggests that an inhomogeneity scale should not exceed 200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the model of spherical clouds is an oversimplification of the reality .",
    "it may well be that a significant fraction of inhomogeneities forms due to the corrugation of the shock front and subsequent shock focusing on density perturbations . in that case one",
    "expects the creation of inhomogeneities with a filamentary geometry .",
    "such inhomogeneities should be characterized by two essentially different scales .",
    "the inhomogeneities with the filamentary structure could be generated also by richtmyer - meshkov , rayleigh - taylor , and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities which can develop during the shock propagation in the medium with the density inversion and density perturbations in the rsg atmosphere .",
    "the issue of the flux fluctuations in the h@xmath0 profile thus may turn out to be a more complicated than in our simple model .",
    "particularly , the filamentary structure could result in a second scale related to the filament length in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the paper has been aimed at the study of the disparity between the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 in early spectra of sn  2008 in .",
    "the point is that in a standard model with a smooth density distribution the density required to reproduce the h@xmath1 line is by a factor of three larger than that required for h@xmath0 .",
    "we find that this problem arises not only on day 11 but on day 18 as well .",
    "assuming inhomogeneous ( clumpy ) density distribution in the outer layer of the supernova envelope , we are able to describe h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 profiles using the same model on days 11 and 18 .",
    "this suggests homologous evolution of clumpy structure , which is expected , if inhomogeneities form at the early expansion phase .    the hydrodynamic model of sn  2008 in permits us to estimate the mass of the external clumpy zone ( @xmath107 km s@xmath3 ) which turns out to be @xmath72 , i.e. , only 0.2% of the ejecta mass .",
    "confronting the flux fluctuations in the model h@xmath0 profile against the observed fluctuations on day 11 ( @xmath108% ) suggests the upper limit of the inhomogeneities size to be @xmath106 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this value should be closely related to a process responsible for the formation of the inhomogeneous structure . in order to detect the fluctuations related to the inhomogeneities",
    ", the spectra in the h@xmath0 band should be obtained with the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath109 and the spectral resolution of @xmath110 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we suggest that the formation of the inhomogeneous structure is related to specific conditions of the shock propagation in the rsg external layers with a mass of ( several)@xmath111 .",
    "it is remarkable , in this respect , that rsgs are known to have a density inversion at the outer boundary of convective zone ( maeder 1992 ; chiavassa et al .",
    "the depth of the density inversion in rsgs with masses of @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath113 of external mass ( fadeev 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the mass of heterogeneous layers of sn  2008 in ( @xmath5 ) falls into that range .",
    "the propagation of the radiation - dominated shock across the density inversion should be accompanied by the formation of a thin swept - up shell and its subsequent fragmentation .",
    "another mechanism for the inhomogeneous structure could be related to density perturbations produced by a vigorous convection . in the rsg outer layers",
    "the velocity of convective flow is comparable with the sound speed @xmath114 ( maeder 1992 ) .",
    "since the density perturbations are of the order of @xmath115 ( landau & lifshitz 1987 ) , the expected perturbations can be as large as @xmath116 .",
    "the shock propagation in the medium with that strong density perturbations should result in the formation of inhomogeneities with the large density contrast .",
    "laboratory experiments on the shock propagation in a turbulent medium demonstrate a significant increase of amount of inhomogeneities with the increase of the mach number ( hesselink & sturtevant 1988 ) .",
    "disregarding the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem , it is little doubt that the inhomogeneous structure of the outer layers of sn  iip should emerge anyway due to the shock wave propagation in the convective zone of the rsg .",
    "moreover , inhomogeneities can be generated additionally by the shock interaction with the rsg density inversion layer .",
    "an interesting outcome of the inhomogeneous structure of the external layers could be a modification ( compared to the homogeneous case ) of the initial radiation outburst of sn  iip related to the shock breakout .",
    "indeed , the radiation diffusion time depends on the characteristics of inhomogeneities in addition to absorption and scattering coefficients .",
    "this issue is of significant importance in view of the search for the initial ultraviolet radiation outburst from core - collapse sne at the high redshift .",
    "another interesting consequence of the inhomogeneous structure of outer layers of sn  iip concerns the circumstellar interaction .",
    "the ejecta inhomogeneities could modify a standard picture of the direct and reverse shock . instead of a spherical reverse shock",
    "a complicated system of the intercloud reverse shock and slow cloud shock should emerge .",
    "moreover , the structure of the direct shock may be modified by protrusions created by dense ejecta clumps .",
    "all these features could affect the properties of radio , x - ray , and optical radiation of sn  iip ( and possibly sn  iil ) related to the circumstellar interaction .",
    "to what extent the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem is ubiquitous for sn  iip ? in case of sn  2006bp ( type iip ) , for which a good set of spectra has been obtained at the early epoch ( quimby at al .",
    "2007 ) , the synthetic spectra that describe the h@xmath1 at 8 - 16 days predict too deep h@xmath0 absorption compared to observations ( cf .",
    "dessart et al .",
    "the early spectra of sn  2006bp and sn  2008 in look similar : the h@xmath1 absorption is strong whereas the h@xmath0 absorption is absent .",
    "a similar picture is seen in early spectra of other normal sn  iip , particularly , sn  1999em ( leonard et al .",
    "2002 ) and sn  2012a ( tomasella et al .",
    "remarkably , the modelling of the spectrum of sn  1993j ( type iib ) on day 10 with the phoenix code ( baron et al . 1995 ) shows the same problem : the strong model h@xmath0 absorption for the sensibly fitted h@xmath1 absorption ( fig . 5 in the referred paper ) .",
    "it should be noted that the sn  1993j pre - sn was a yellow supergiant ( aldering & humphreys 1994 ) . on the other hand , for sn  1987a ,",
    "in which case the pre - sn was a blue supergiant , the disparity between h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 is absent ( uc13 ) .",
    "this fact supports our conjecture that the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 problem arises only in the case of explosions of red ( yellow ) supergiants and not blue supergiants .",
    "we demonstrate that the problem of the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 disparity takes place in early spectra of sn  2008 in both on day 11 and day 18 .",
    "it is shown that the problem can be solved in terms of the clumpy density structure in the outer sn layers with a mass of @xmath117 .",
    "the clumpy structure of the outer layers of supernova is suggested to be an outcome of the density perturbation in the rsg external convective zone combined with the density inversion .",
    "the shock propagation in this medium presumably generates inhomogeneities in sn ejecta with a high density contrast .",
    "tests are proposed for the verification of the clumpy density distribution of outer layers of sn  iip .",
    "the first is based on the detection of the flux fluctuations in the early h@xmath0 line profile at the level of @xmath108% .",
