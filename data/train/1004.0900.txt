    "additional promising observable for the understanding of nuclear equation of state is the anisotropy in the momentum distribution that includes the directed in - plane flow ( bounce off ) as well as out of plane flow ( squeeze out ) @xcite .",
    "the absolute values of the flow results from the interplay between the attractive mean field and repulsive nucleon - nucleon scatterings .",

    "+ following the recent development of radioactive beam facilities in many parts of the world , it became possible to study the neutron ( or proton ) rich nuclear collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "therefore , for a meaningful investigation , one should include the isospin dependence of the field . as pointed out by bauer @xcite , nuclear stopping at intermediate energies is determined by the mean field as well as by the in - medium nn cross - sections .",

    "the recent work of many authors @xcite suggest that the degree of approaching isospin equilibration helps to probe the nuclear stopping in heavy - ion collisions . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "isospin dependence of cross - section was investigated in nuclear stopping .",

    "several more studies have also focused in the recent years on the isospin degree of freedom @xcite .",

    "the top , middle and bottom panels are at @xmath36 = 0 , 0.3 and 0.6 , respectively . here phase space of free particles [ a = 1 ] , light charged particles ( lcp s ) [ 2@xmath37a@xmath374 ] and intermediate mass fragments(imfs)[5@xmath37 a @xmath37 44 ] is displayed .",
    "we note that irrespective of the symmetry energy , central collisions lead to complete spherical distribution of particles , indicating , spreading of the nucleons in all directions .",
    "it means that breaking of initial correlations among nucleons is maximal in this region and , as a result , more randomization and stopping in the hot and compressed nuclear matter occurs .",
    "this effect seems to decrease with impact parameter . since free particles as well as lcp s",
    "originate from the mid - rapidity region , they are better suited for studying the degree of stopping reached in a heavy - ion collision . on the other hand",
    ", imf s seems to originate either from the target or from the projectile region , therefore , are the remnant / residue of the spectator matter .",

    "to further quantify this observation , we display in fig.[fig:2 ] , the rapidity distribution @xmath38 for the emission of free nucleons as well as lcp s and imf s .",
    "we see that free particles and lcp s emitted in the central collisions form a single narrow gaussian shape , whereas , imf s have broader gaussian , indicating less thermalization .",
    "as we increase impact parameter , single gaussian distribution splits into two gaussian ( at target and projectile rapidities ) , indicating correlated matter . from the shape of the gaussian",
    ", one sees that free particles and lcp s are better indicator of thermal source .",
    "obviously , this condition is necessary , but , not a sufficient one . + from the figure , it is also evident that the symmetry energy does not plays significant role for the rapidity distribution .",
    "the peak value of the gaussian for lcp s is altered by about 10@xmath0 , whereas , nearly no effect is seen in the case of intermediate mass fragments .",
    "the reason is that lcp s can feel the role of mean field directly , while , the heavy fragments have weak sensitivity @xcite . from the figure",
    ", one sees a one to one relation between the degree of stopping and emission of lcp s .",
    "these conclusions match with the findings of fig.[fig:1 ] and ref.@xcite .",
    "+ in fig.[fig:3 ] , we display impact parameter dependence of global variables ( @xmath32 and @xmath1 ) , whereas , the multiplicity dependence of free nucleons and lcp s is displayed in fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "the displayed results are at @xmath40= 0 and @xmath40 = 32 mev in each panel , while , in panel ( b ) the results are also displayed with isospin - dependent cross - section .",
    "the value of cross - section is denoted in the superscript . from fig.[fig:3 ] , we observe that @xmath32 and @xmath41 behave in opposite fashion i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath42 will behave in a similar fashion . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , it can be explained by the preponderance of momentum flow perpendicular to the beam direction@xcite . the maximum stopping is observed around 400 mev / nucleon , which is in supportive nature with the findings of w. reisdorf _",
    "et al._@xcite . in their work , they measured the nuclear stopping from 0.090 to 1.93 gev / nucleon and maximal stopping was observed around 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "it is clear that if the reaction reaches the maximal stopping around certain energies , the matter formed in the reaction should reach minimum transparency and thus most of the particles are preferentially out - of - plane . on the other hand ,",
    "no visible effect is seen for symmetry energy term .",
    "we see both quantities are nearly independent of the symmetry energy , while , strongly depends on the isospin - dependent cross - section .",
    "+     same as in fig.[fig:3 ] , but for the multiplicity of free particles / nucleon and lcps / nucleon . ]    as we know , major contribution for the stopping of nuclear matter is from the hot and compressed region , where symmetry energy does not play any role .",
    "some small spikes can be seen at lower beam energies , however , outcome is independent of the symmetry energy at higher incident energies .",
    "this is due to the fact that above the fermi energy , incident energy itself is sufficient to break the initial correlations among the nucleons . on the other hand",
    ", isospin - dependent cross - section will lead to violent n - n collisions , which further cause the transformation of the initial longitudinal motion in other directions and hence thermalization of the system .",
    "this dominant role played by the isospin - dependent cross - section gradually disappears with increase in the impact parameter .",
    "as discussed earlier , stopping is the phenomena which originates from the participant zone and this zone goes on decreasing with increase in the impact parameter and hence the effect of cross - section on nuclear stopping .",
    "these findings are also in supportive nature with the findings of liu _ et al . , _ @xcite .",
    "+     impact parameter dependence of ( a ) r , ( b ) @xmath41 , ( c ) free particles / nucleon , ( d ) lcps / nucleon , with hard ( h ) and soft ( s ) equations of state .",
    "the results are displayed at @xmath45 ( i ) and 32 mev ( ii ) . ]    to correlate the degree of stopping with the multiplicity of fragments , we display in fig.[fig:4 ] , the impact parameter dependence of the multiplicity of free nucleons as well as of lcp s .",
    "the behavior of all curves is similar to that of nuclear stopping parameters @xmath32 and @xmath42 , as discussed in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "in addition , lcp s are more sensitive towards symmetry energy compared to free particles . due to pairing nature of lcp s ,",
    "symmetry energy term @xmath46 @xmath47 contributes considerably .",
    "the effect of isospin - dependent cross - section is more visible for the lcp s as compared to free particles .",
    "this also gives us clue that lcp s production can act as a indicator for the nuclear stopping .",
    "moreover , free particles / nucleon are found to increase monotonically with the incident energy , while lcps / nucleon behave in similar fashion as that of nuclear stopping i.e. maximum around 400 mev / nucleon and then decreases .",
    "it is also evident from ref.@xcite , lcp s production act as a barometer for nuclear stopping compared to the free particles .",
    "+     system size dependence of ( a ) r , ( b ) @xmath42 , ( c ) free particles , ( d ) lcp s , in the presence of symmetry energy . all the curves",
    "are fitted with power law . ]    in fig.[fig:5 ] , we have checked the sensitivity of nuclear stopping as well as fragment production with the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) . for this purpose ,",
    "a hard ( h ) and soft ( s ) equations of state with compressibility @xmath48 = 380 , 200 mev are employed , respectively .",
    "the nuclear stopping is found to be weakly dependent on the equations of state , while , the fragments production is sensitive to different equations of state .",
    "it means that the fragment production with different equations of state can act as a global indicator for the nuclear stopping as it is weakly dependent on equations of state . +",
    "it also becomes important to study the system size dependence and isospin asymmetry of r , @xmath42 , free particles and lcp s .",
    "for this , in fig.[fig:6 ] , we have displayed the results for the reactions of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath35 and @xmath52 , in which z as well as a is varied .",
    "on the other hand , results are displayed , in fig.[fig:7 ] , for the reactions of @xmath53 ( n / z = 0.7 ) , @xmath49 ( n / z = 1 ) , @xmath54 ( n / z = 1.4 ) and @xmath55 ( n / z = 1.85 ) , having same z and different a , in the presence of symmetry energy and isospin - dependent cross - section .",
    "the curves in figs.[fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] are parametrized with the power law @xmath56 , where c and @xmath57 are constants , while x and y are the respective parameters on x and y axis .",

    "all the parameters are found to increase with the composite mass of the system . for a fixed geometry ( semi - central here ) , more heavier",
    "is the composite system , more hot is the compressed zone , which further results in more thermalization or global stopping .",
    "looking the parallel side , the free particles and lcp s will always originate from the participant zone . with an increase in the composite mass of the system , the participant zone goes on increasing for a fixed geometry ( semi - central here ) and hence the production of free particles and lcp , s .",
    "similar findings are also published in the ref.@xcite .",
    "+ the dependence of these parameters on the isospin asymmetry ( n / z dependence ) displayed , in fig.[fig:7 ] , is also found to be in supportive nature with the findings in fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "an increase in the number of neutrons will increase the number of collisions and hence dominance of r , @xmath42 , free particles as well as lcp s is observed with increase in n / z ratio .",
    "nuclear stopping as well as lcp s are observed to be strongly dependent on the isospin - dependent cross - section .",
    "similar results with isospin dependent cross - section are observed in figs.[fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] . from here , one may conclude that the nuclear stopping and lcp s can also be used as a tool to investigate the isospin - dependent cross - section .",

    "once free nucleons and lcp s are normalized with @xmath32 at the starting point of impact parameter , we see that their behavior with respect to impact parameter is similar to that of anisotropy ratio , whereas , visible difference occurs with reference to quadrupole moment .",
    "this similarity in all three quantities in the presence of symmetry energy makes lcp s good indicator of global stopping in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in summary , using the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd)model , we investigate the emission of free particles , lcp s , and degree of stopping reached in a heavy - ion collisions in the presence of symmetry energy and isospin dependent cross - section .",
    "we observed that nuclear stopping in term of anisotropy ratio and quadrupole moment depends weakly on the symmetry energy and strongly on the isospin - dependent cross - section . on the other hand",
    ", the symmetry energy and isospin - dependent cross - section has an effect of @xmath58 on the lcp s production .",
    "it means nuclear stopping and lcp s production can be used as a tool to investigate the isospin - dependent cross - section .",
