    "amorphous materials have a great potential for application in technological devices , but their uses are limited due to several factors .",
    "one of them is the difficulty to obtain information about their atomic structures .",
    "since most chemical and physical properties of these materials are defined by the first neighbors , knowledge of their structures becomes necessary .",
    "due to the lack of translational symmetry , the determination of their atomic structures involves the combination of different diffraction and spectroscopic techniques as well as simulations and modeling .",
    "the structure of an amorphous binary alloy is described by three pair correlation functions @xmath6 , which are the fourier transformation of the three partial structure factors @xmath7 .",
    "the total structure factor @xmath1 , which can be derived from scattering measurements , is a weighted sum of these three @xmath7 factors @xcite .",
    "thus , to determine the three partial @xmath7 at least three independent @xmath1 factors are needed .",
    "usually , the following methods have been used to obtain these @xmath1 factors :    1 .",
    "isomorphous substitution : in this method one component of the amorphous alloy is substituted by a ( expected ) chemically similar one .",
    "for example , in amorphous ni - zr alloys the zr atoms are replaced by hf atoms or the ni atoms are partially substituted by co or fe atoms @xcite .",
    "this method is not very accurate since one can not be sure of the chemical similarity of the two elements involved .",
    "isotope substitution : in this method one component of the amorphous alloy is substituted by an isotope or by an isotopic mixture and the scattering measurements are carried out using neutron sources .",
    "for example , in amorphous ni - zr alloys the ni atoms are replaced by a ni isotope @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this method are limited by the availability of adequate isotopes .    with the development of the synchrotron radiation sources , anomalous wide angle x - ray scattering ( awaxs ) and differential anomalous scattering ( das ) techniques became available for structural study of multicomponent disordered materials .",
    "awaxs utilizes an incident radiation that is tuned close to an atomic absorption edge so that it interacts resonantly with the electrons of that particular atom .",
    "the atomic scattering factor of each chemical component can therefore be varied individually and the chemical environment about each component in the material can be investigated .",
    "thus , in the case of an amorphous binary alloy , by using only one sample three independent @xmath1 factors can be obtained .",
    "however , the matrix formed by the weights of the three @xmath1 factors is ill - conditioned , becoming difficult the determination of the three @xmath7 factors .",
    "fuoss@xcite tried to overcome this difficulty by implementing the das approach , which was proposed by schevick @xcite .",
    "the das approach consists in taking the difference between the scattering patterns measured at two incident photon energies just below the edge of a particular atom , so that all correlation not involving this atom subtract out since only the atomic scattering factor of this atom changes appreciably .",
    "later , de lima _ et al_. @xcite , following a suggestion made by munro @xcite , combined the differential scattering factors @xmath2 and the @xmath1 factors .",
    "they observed that this combination reduces the conditioning number of the matrix formed by the weights of these factors , allowing more stable values of @xmath7 to be obtained .    the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) simulation technique @xcite has been successfully used for structural modeling of amorphous structures .",
    "@xmath1 factors or their fourier transformations , the total reduced radial distribution functions @xmath8 , can be used as input data .",
    "applications of this technique to polymeric @xcite , crystalline @xcite and amorphous  @xcite materials are described in the literature .    in this paper , we report the determination of the three @xmath7 factors obtained for amorphous nizr@xmath0 alloy by two independent ways : by making a combination of awaxs and das techniques and also by combining awaxs and rmc simulations techniques .",

    "the chemical short - range order parameter is a quantitative measurement of the degree of chemical short - range order .",
    "there are several definitions of chemical short - range order parameters @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the warren chemical short - range order ( csro ) parameter @xmath166 @xcite given below to compare the amorphous nizr@xmath0 alloy and the nizr@xmath0 compound .",
    "@xmath167    here , @xmath168 and @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the total coordination numbers in the first shell . by using the coordination numbers given in table [ tab2 ] , we found @xmath171 and for the compound @xmath172 .",
    "the chemical short - range order in the amorphous nizr@xmath0 alloy is similar to that found in a solid solution , for which @xmath173 .",
    "the same behavior is observed in the nizr@xmath0 compound .",
    "the amorphous nizr@xmath0 alloy was investigated by using awaxs , das and rmc simulations techniques .",
    "the three @xmath7 factors were determined by using two independent ways : a combination of awaxs and das techniques and by combining awaxs and rmc simulations techniques .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 factors obtained by both combinations showed an excellent agreement , but the simulations gave the best result for the @xmath3 factor .",
    "the coordination numbers and interatomic distances calculated from the rdf@xmath174 functions obtained by these two combinations show a good agreement among themselves and with those extracted from the deconvolution of the @xmath88 and @xmath86 functions .",
    "the results achieved in this study suggest that the combination of the rmc simulations method and awaxs can be used to obtain more reliable @xmath7 factors than those obtained by the matrix inversion method , in particular for the ni - ni pairs , which have the smallest weighting factor .",
    "this was already observed in a neutron diffraction study performed in a cubr alloy @xcite , which is also an ill - conditioned problem similar to ours .",
    "in addition , this combination gives us some evidence of the presence of distorted polyhedral units with triangular faces in the atomic structure of the amorphous nizr@xmath0 alloy .",
    "the calculated warren csro parameter indicated that the chemical short - range order found in the amorphous nizr@xmath0 alloy is similar to that found in a solid solution , and there is some resemblance with that found in the nizr@xmath0 compound ."
