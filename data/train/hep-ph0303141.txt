    "in some developments of the yang - mills theories one arrives at situations when the encountered states can be effectively described as media , possessing non - abelian polarization properties .",
    "we list a few of these examples for sake of brevity .    among the first prototypes for a non - abelian polarizable medium",
    "one may take the qcd vacuum state in the aspect considered by savvidy @xcite , fukuda and kazama @xcite , adler @xcite , nielsen and olesen @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "baker and zachariasen used the yang - mills vacuum as a polarizable medium in order to derive a confining potential .",
    "they also solved the dyson equations for the gluon propagator @xmath2 for @xmath3 evaluating the color susceptibility of the vacuum in the weak field approximation .",
    "the polarization properties of the non - abelian @xmath4 vacuum were exploited in @xcite for an approximate classical description of some non - perturbative effects such as solutions corresponding to non - vanishing gauge field `` condensates '' .",
    "another and more recent set of examples comes from the theoretical study of some not yet confirmed states of the hadron matter - hadron matter at very high densities and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at very high temperatures where one expects the quarks and gluons to be in a deconfined phase . in a systematic study performed in the framework of kinetic theory the color conductivity and other transport coefficients of non - abelian plasma were derived by heinz in @xcite in the linear response approximation .",
    "the response of qgp beyond the linear approximation was considered in @xcite yielding a color dielectric susceptibility modified by the non - linear corrections .",
    "typical non - abelian medium effects on the color dielectric constant @xmath5 were further investigated in @xcite also on the base of kinetic theory .",
    "the approach of heinz has been generalized in @xcite to include the effects of fluctuations in deriving effective transport equations for qcd .",
    "a clear review of the methods of semi - classical transport theory for non - abelian plasma can be found in @xcite .    from the analysis of the phenomenon of color superconductivity of hadron matter at high density @xcite",
    ", it has been found that the medium surrounding the liberated quarks exhibits a polarization behavior characterized by an effective color dielectric constant @xmath6 , the magnetic permeability remaining close to one .",
    "the estimate @xmath6 has also been obtained in @xcite evaluating the photon self - energy for a color superconductor .",
    "the case of two - flavor color superconductor with prescribed dielectric susceptibility and magnetic permeability of the medium was considered by d. litim and c. manuel @xcite applying the methods of transport theory and extending the results of rischke , son and stephanov to finite temperature .",
    "finally , we mention models such as the chromodielectric model proposed by friedberg and lee @xcite and developed in @xcite . aimed to describe an effective mechanism for the confinement phenomena , this model exploits a dielectric function depending on a classical field in order to account for the interaction of the qcd matter .",
    "also in @xcite dremin introduced a refraction coefficient @xmath7 phenomenologically for a hadron medium , exploiting the relation between @xmath7 and the elastic forward scattering amplitude of light derived in classical electrodynamics . among other applications , for a quark - parton medium he used the appearance of a so postulated @xmath7 to consider the emission of cherenkov - type gluons ( for @xmath8 ) in order to explain the ring - like structures observed in hadron - hadron or central nucleus - nucleus collisions as generated by gluon jets produced in such processes ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "having in mind these examples , our view - point is that , if in the interactions of a medium with yang - mills fields one encounters manifestations of its polarization - type response to the gauge fields , then it is worth developing an in - medium yang - mills theory and apply it to situations where such a response is found to be essential ( like , e.g. the quark - gluon plasma ) .    in this paper",
    "we derive the classical yang - mills equations for a gauge group @xmath0 in a medium in the case when the medium responses linearly to an external gauge field ( i.e. we derive the analogs of the macroscopic maxwell equations for a gauge theory ) and perform a canonical quantization of the arising theory . in the derivation of the classical in - medium",
    "gauge field equations we follow the method of akhiezer and peletminsky @xcite in their derivation of the macroscopic maxwell equations . in section 2",
    "we introduce some of the notations and write down the equations for a system of interacting spinor and gauge fields in the presence of a weak external gauge field . in section 3",
    "these equations are averaged by means of a non - equilibrium statistical operator in the linear approximation with respect to the external field , and the averaged `` color '' electric and magnetic fields @xmath9 are introduced .",
    "there appear three types of ( generalized ) conductivity tensors defined in terms of the relevant retarded green s functions .",
    "the first is a straightforward generalization to the yang - mills case of the `` classical electrodynamic '' conductivity tensor , while the second and the third one appear due to the ( eventually ) non - commutative character of the gauge group . in section 4",
    "the relevant polarization tensors , characterizing the medium , are defined , two of them having direct analogs in the classical case , and other two originating from the non - commutativity of the gauge group . assuming a linear relation between the polarization tensors and the fields @xmath9 , we define the ( non - abelian ) susceptibility tensors . in section 5",
    "we define the generalized electric and magnetic inductions , the ( generalized ) magnetic permeability and electric permittivity tensors @xmath10,@xmath11 , and write down the derived in - medium yang - mills equations . as in the standard case ,",
    "four of these equations describe the `` color '' induction vectors . in order to write the remaining equations , we define modified `` color '' fields @xmath12 obtained from @xmath9 by means of the `` non - abelian '' susceptibility tensors . in section 6",
    "we perform an approximation up to second order in the gauge coupling constant which simplifies the in - medium equations significantly reducing them to a form resembling closely the maxwell in - medium equations . defining the constitutive equations for the medium",
    ", we obtain relations between @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and the conductivity tensors in the approximation considered .",
    "these relations appear as natural generalizations of their analogs in the classical macroscopic electrodynamics .",
    "we follow brevik and lautrup @xcite and nakanishi @xcite in their treatment of the electromagnetic field which avoids work with constrained systems .",
    "although in @xcite one deals with in - medium electromagnetic field , and @xcite consider the electromagnetic field in vacuum , these papers use a common approach , namely a lagrangian formulation involving an auxiliary scalar field whose action on the fock space is designed to separate the physical subspace . for a medium moving uniformly , section 5 provides a lagrangian formulation of the previously obtained equations introducing a set of @xmath13 auxiliary fields @xmath14 . for sake of simplicity",
    "we consider constant and diagonal tensors @xmath5 and @xmath15 . from the equal time",
    "commutation relations , in section 6 we evaluate the commutators at arbitrary space - time points . in section 7 the fields fourier transforms are introduced . in the resulting fock space a physical subspace is defined by means of the operators @xmath14 .",
    "finally , for a particular choice of the gauge we evaluate the gauge field propagator . as a first application the cross - section for elastic quark - quark scattering",
    "is given in the born approximation .",
    "it is noticed that the in - medium yang - mills equations considered here provide a natural framework for the dremin s approach to explain the specific ring - like structures in hadron processes as resulting from a cherenkov - type gluon radiation .",
    "other applications , like , e.g. color superconductivity , lie beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "<S> the equations for a yang - mills field in a medium are derived in the approximation of linear response to an external field . introducing tensors of generalized susceptibilities , </S>",
    "<S> the in - medium equations are written in a form similar to the in - medium maxwell equations . </S>",
    "<S> the non - abelian character of the gauge group @xmath0 is reflected in the presence of susceptibility tensors with no counterpart in electrodynamics and the necessity to define modified `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields ( apart from the `` color '' induction vectors ) . which enter the in - medium equations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reduce to @xmath1 copies of maxwell in - medium equations in the approximation up to second order in the gauge coupling constant . for a medium uniformly moving , a canonical quantization is performed for a family of fermi - like gauges in the case of constant and diagonal ( in the group indices ) tensors of `` electric '' permittivity and `` magnetic '' permeability . the physical subspace is defined and the gauge field propagator is evaluated for a particular choice of the gauge . </S>",
    "<S> it is applied firstly for evaluation of the cross - section of elastic quark scattering in the born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications to cherenkov - type gluon radiation are commented briefly . </S>"
