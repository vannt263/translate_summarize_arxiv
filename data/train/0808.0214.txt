    "the new generation of high - angular resolution cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ground - based experiments represented by the the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite are currently targeting their observations in a common area in the southern sky that will ultimately cover several hundreds to thousands of square degrees . these experiments will provide a blind survey of the oldest light in the universe at wavelengths of @xmath1  mm and angular scales beyond the resolution limits of the wmap and planck satellites . at these arcminute angular scales , temperature fluctuations in the cmb are dominated by secondary effects arising from the formation of large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "one of the strongest effects is the imprint left by galaxy clusters though the sunyaev zeldovich effect ( sze ) @xcite in which cmb photons suffer inverse compton scattering by the hot intracluster gas .",
    "act and spt are designed to detect the sze , through its frequency - dependence : these experiments will measure temperature shifts of the cmb radiation corresponding to a decrement below and an increment above the `` null '' frequency around 220  ghz .",
    "much can be learned about the universe from these surveys .",
    "first , accurate systematics - free maps will allow measurement of the primary power spectrum of temperature fluctuations at all scales on which they are the dominant contribution .",
    "second , these data sets will result in a complete census of massive clusters to arbitrarily large distances , limited only by a minimum cluster mass set largely by the instrumental sensitivity and expected to be several @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the relatively clean selection function as well as the redshift independence of the sze , the cluster sample , especially the evolution of the number density of clusters with redshift , will be quite sensitive to the growth of structure in the universe offering a potentially powerful probe of dark energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sze data in combination with optical , uv and x - ray observations can teach us a great deal about the detailed physics of cluster atmospheres and galaxy evolution in these dense environments .    significant observing time and effort",
    "has been devoted to the development of techniques and the detection of galaxy clusters using large - area optical catalogs and x - ray observations .",
    "several projects have taken advantage of large - area ccd imaging and have developed automated cluster detection schemes to produce large catalogs of clusters of galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the goal of the scs is to maximize the scientific return from the new ground - based cmb experiments and therefore focuses on specific observational studies relevant to this science , such as the selection function of galaxy clusters across wavebands , cluster mass determination , and the establishment a `` gold '' sample of clusters for cosmology and galaxy evolution studies .",

    "photometric redshifts come from the 4-band imaging data , while our mass estimates are inferred from the optical luminosity ( @xmath6 ) and richness ( 200 ) of the clusters , using relations calibrated by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . for the eight massive clusters , out of 38 identified ( 37 are new sources ) in the survey area",
