    "the recent apparition of comet c/2012 s1 ( ison ) presented a unique opportunity to observe a dynamically new , sungrazing , oort cloud comet @xcite prior to its reaching perihelion on 2013 november 28 2013 at a distance of only 2.7 @xmath18 . the initial gas production of an oort cloud comet , undergoing its first passage into the inner solar system , is expected to be dominated by an excess `` frosting '' of volatile ices .",
    "this frosting is thought to have been created over a solar lifetime ( @xmath13 4.6 gyrs ) through the bombardment of the comet s icy surface by a flux of interstellar dust , cosmic rays , ultraviolet and x - ray radiation in the nether regions between the outermost solar system and the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "it is further thought that if the frosting is thin enough , then the mass sublimation process , precipitated by the steady increase in the radiation environment on ingress towards the sun , will gradually reveal a surface composition that is primordial in nature .",
    "the ingress of ison was closely followed by a global network of amateur and profession observers shortly after its discovery by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have prepared a comprehensive review and model of its photometric and water production behavior , starting with the pre - discovery photometry and extending beyond its total disintegration at 5.2 @xmath18 @xmath19 3.5 hours prior to perihelion .",
    "the observations reveal that the photometric variations and water production rates were on a seesaw cycle of coma expansion and depletion on ever shortening timescales throughout ingress .",
    "five cycles were identified up to 2013 november 12.9 .",
    "disintegration was presaged by two major fragmentation events , led by a 10 fold increase in the observed water production rates between november 12.9 and 16.6 and followed by a 5 fold increase between november 19.6 and 21.6 .",
    "water production rates were derived from observations made by the solar wind anisoltropies ( swan ) ly@xmath8  camera on the _ solar and heliospheric observer ( soho ) _ satellite ,    we report here on far - uv observations from a sounding rocket borne spectro / telescope made in the intervening period of the second event on november 20.49 .    sounding rockets offer a unique platform for observing the far - uv emission of cometary bodies in close proximity to the sun .",
    "the far - uv bandpass provides access to a particularly rich set of spectral diagnostics for determining the production rates of co , h , c , o and s. safety concerns for _ hst _ restrict its use to solar elongation angles of @xmath20 50@xmath21 , translating to heliocentric distances of @xmath20 0.766 au in contrast , sounding rocket borne instruments can use the earth s limb to occult the sun .",
    "the observations of ison described here were made at an elongation of 26@xmath03 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance @xmath1  =  0.43 au , a heliocentric velocity of @xmath22  km  s@xmath3 , a separation between the earth and comet of @xmath23 = 0.84 au and a relative velocity with respect to earth of @xmath24  km  s@xmath3 .",

    "* ) is a 0.5 m diameter f/10 gregorian telescope ( concave primary and secondary optics ) with a diffractive triaxially figured secondary , creating an on - axis imaging channel and two redundant off - axis spectral channels that share a common focal plane .",
    "the spectral channels have a inverse linear dispersion of 20   mm@xmath3 .",
    "the spectral bandpass is @xmath13 800  1800  .",
    "the imaging plate scale is 41@xmath2525 mm@xmath3 .",
    "the fov is ( 0@xmath05)@xmath7 .",
    "a programable multi - object capability is provided by a microshutter array ( msa ) placed at the prime focus of the telescope .",
    "the msa has 43 rows @xmath6 86 columns in the fov .",
    "an experimental target acquisition system , is designed to operate autonomously with the intent of limiting spectral confusion by closing all but one column on each of the 43 rows .",
    "each individual shutter subtends a solid angle of @xmath26 = 12@xmath27 @xmath6 36@xmath259 .",
    "our flight msa was derived from prototype versions of the large area arrays developed at goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) for use in the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) on the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _",
    "the shutters are opened with the help of a magnet that passes in front of the array , timed to coincide with a serial stream of opening voltages .",
    "shutters are closed by reversing the direction of the magnet and applying closing voltages .",
    "the three channel microchannel plate ( mcp ) detector , custom built by sensor sciences , employs separate sets of crossed delay - line readout - anodes fed by z - stack mcps with csi photocathode inputs .",
    "the deadtime of the pulse counting electronics is 400 ns , however , the maximum countrate of each channel is limited by the telemetry clock rate of the first - in - first - out ( fifo ) buffer used to collect the pulse heights and locations in x and y. the pulse clock rate is 62.5 khz for the zero - order imaging channel and 125 khz each spectral channel .",
    "we refer to these channels as p1zero , p2minus and p3plus .",
    "the zero - order imager has a short wavelength cutoff defined by the transmission of a caf@xmath28 , mgf@xmath28 cylindrical doublet lens .",
    "the doublet is included to correct astigmatism in the imager and limit background counts from the geocoronal ly@xmath8 .",
    "the slits in the microshutter array have a pitch of 1 mm @xmath6 0.5 mm in the secondary focal plane . a few percent of the shutters are not active due to shorts between columns and/or rows in the array .",
    "these shorts are masked out to prevent drawing excessive current that could potentially damage the array .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] is an image of the active microshutters acquired during pre - flight payload qualification testing .",
    "the illumination source was a slow paraxial beam of @xmath41849 provided by a penray lamp .",
    "approximately 70% of the shutters were active .",
    "the effective area of fortis was determined from component level efficiency measurements pre- and post - flight made with the calibration and test equipment ( cte ) at jhu @xcite , following the procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the post - flight effective areas of the spectral and imaging channels , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , will be used for this work .",
    "jhu / nasa sounding rocket 36.296ug was launched from lc-36 at white sands missile range , new mexico at 04:40 mst on 20 november 2013 .",
    "the black - brant ix delivery system carried our experimental spectro / telescope , fortis , to an apogee of 270 km , providing 395 seconds of exoatmospheric time above 100 km .    in flight , the plan for target acquisition was to observe the comet for 30 seconds in the imaging channel through a fully open msa , and then deploy a preprogramed slit , in the shape of a k , on the center of brightness .",
    "the location of the center of brightness was to be determined by an on - the - fly peak locating subsystem , serving as an interface between the zero - order imager and msa .",
    "unfortunately the preprogramed slit never successfully deployed due to magnet and address timing issues , frustrating our goal of acquiring confusion limited spectral information from selected regions in the coma along and across the sun - comet line in an effort to detect faint volatile species .",
    "nevertheless zero order images and dispersed spectral images were acquired through a `` mostly open '' msa , during an @xmath19 50 second interval ending @xmath19 40 seconds before apogee .",
    "three additional attempts to deploy preprogramed slits at roughly 60 second intervals resulted in a `` partially open '' msa , having similar shutter patterns wherein @xmath19 half of the bottom half of the shutters remained closed .",
    "a large block of open shutters surrounding the comet allowed the extraction of radially averaged profiles from the weaker emissions in the zero - order channel and `` slit averaged '' profiles from the very strong emissions in the spectral channels .",
    "an additional complication arose in determining the true count in the spectral channels . during much of the flight",
    "the observed rate was saturated at the telemetry sample rate of 125 khz .",
    "fortunately , during the second attempt to deploy a slit the count rate in the `` p2minus '' channel , which is the slightly - less - sensitive of the two , fell below the sample rate to 115 khz in response to the smaller number of open shutters .",
    "a modest deadtime correction factor of 1.16 was found postflight for the ratio of the true rate to the sampled rate .",
    "the correction was determined in postflight calibrations by taking advantage of the linearity provided by a cesium iodide coated photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) in response to a steadily increasing illumination from a deuterium lamp .",
    "a plot of the countrate from the pmt against the countrate of a similarly illuminated fifo buffered mcp , clocked by telemetry , provided the correction factor .",
    "representative data acquired pre - apogee and near - reentry are shown in figures  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the top panels show the on - axis zero - order imaging and off - axis spectral channels .",
    "the zero - order imaging has been multiplied by 15 and a 1/4 root stretch has been applied to elevate faint features .",
    "the bottom panels show the projection of the images onto the x - axis , allowing assessment of the background levels to be subtracted .",
    "the zero - order imager has a significant background with respect to the cometary signal .",
    "initial background measurements were acquired in the zero - order channel before arriving at the comet .",
    "they were used as the basis of a model to account for the background variations in the cometary images during the course of the flight .",
    "the projected background model is shown in red and the result from the subtraction is shown in blue .",
    "the spectral images are dominated by the intense emission of cometary ly@xmath8 , with has a peak brightness of 625 krayleigh .",
    "the background levels are quite small in comparison and a small constant level has been subtracted .",
    "we will present evidence in the following section that the emissions in the imaging channel are dominated by @xmath41657 .",
    "the spatial distribution of cometary emissions provides a means to estimate the gas production rates for its atomic and molecular constituents .",
    "here we provide some basic formulae commonly used in the analysis and then move to estimates for the production of water , carbon and carbon monoxide .",
    "we use simple steady state @xcite models and the @xcite vectorial models to constrain the production rates .",
    "these models will deviate from the data when variations occur on timescales shorter than the radial scale divided by outflow velocity of a given species .",
    "the length scales probed here range from @xmath13 10@xmath29 to 10@xmath5 km .",
    "uv line emission from cometary volatiles arise primarily from absorption of solar flux by resonant ( ground state ) transitions , producing excited atoms or molecules that then re - emit into 4@xmath30 sr .",
    "line intensity varies with the square of the distance between the comet and the sun ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if there is a coincidence between the resonance absorption and a set of strong line emission within the solar spectrum , as is the case for , then the shape of the solar line profile and the relative velocity between the comet and the sun become another important factor in modulating the fluorescence line intensity @xcite .",
    "the scattering efficiency for a transition , conventionally calculated at 1 au and commonly known as the `` g - factor '' , is given by ;",
    "@xmath31    where @xmath32  is the wavelength , @xmath33 is the oscillator strength , @xmath34 is the branching ratio for the excited transition ( ratio of the @xmath35 transition de - excitation rate to the sum of all transitions out of the excited state ) .",
    "@xmath36 is the solar photon flux at 1 au ( ) doppler shifted the appropriate heliocentric velocity , @xmath37 .",
    "the above formula is valid for the optically thin case . a more sophisticated treatment models the absorbing transition as a voigt profile integrated over the doppler shifted solar spectrum ,",
    "so in general the g - factor is also a function of column density .",
    "optically thin g - factors are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] for @xmath41561 , @xmath41657 , @xmath41425 , @xmath41475 and @xmath41304 , .",
