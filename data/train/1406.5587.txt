    "for hundreds of years , it was assumed that if planetary systems existed around other stars , they would look substantially like our own solar system @xcite .",

    "the discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planetary systems over the last 20 years have instead revealed a picture of planetary system diversity `` far stranger than we can imagine '' @xcite .",
    "we now know that planetary systems containing a `` jupiter analog '' ( a gas giant planet which has remained in a low - eccentricity orbit beyond the ice line after planetary migration ) are relatively uncommon @xcite , while results from the _ kepler _ spacecraft @xcite have shown us that super - earths in compact multiple systems are very common @xcite . while _ kepler _",
    "has revolutionized exoplanetary science and provided a first estimate of the frequency of earth - size planets in earth - like orbits , long - term radial - velocity surveys @xcite complement these data with measurements of the frequency of jupiter - like planets in jupiter - like orbits .",
    "this in turn will reveal how common solar - system - like architectures are .",
    "in addition to the finding that small , close - in planets are far more common than long - period gas giants @xcite , planet - search efforts are now expanding into new realms of parameter space , seeking to understand how the detailed properties of planetary systems depend on the properties of their host stars . in the early days of exoplanet observations ,",
    "host stars significantly more massive than our sun were neglected , due to the difficulties in determining precise radial velocities . in recent years , however , several radial velocity surveys have begun to take advantage of stellar evolution by observing such higher - mass stars once they have evolved off the main sequence to become subgiants and giants .",
    "this approach has been successfully used by several teams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the aaps has been in operation for 15 years , and has achieved a long - term radial - velocity precision of 3  or better since its inception , which is enabling the detection of long - period giant planets @xcite .",
    "gj832b is one of only a handful of such giant planets known to orbit m dwarfs .",
    "the others are gj179b @xcite , gj849b @xcite , gj328b @xcite , and ogle-2006-blg-109 lb @xcite . of the long - period giant planets known to orbit m dwarfs",

    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 briefly describes the three data sets and gives the stellar parameters .",
    "section 3 details the traditional and bayesian orbit fitting procedures , and gives the parameters of gj832c . in section 4 , we give a discussion on potential habitability before drawing our final conclusions .",
    "we have combined three high - precision radial - velocity data sets that span a variety of baselines .",

    "are derived from the absorption lines embedded on the spectrum by the iodine cell @xcite .",
    "the result is a precise doppler velocity estimate for each epoch , along with an internal uncertainty estimate , which includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the iodine - free template and epoch spectra observed through the iodine cell .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the zero - point defined by the template observation .",
    "gj832 has been observed on 39 epochs since ( table  [ aatvels ] ) , with a total data span of 5465 d ( 15 yr ) .",
    "the mean internal velocity uncertainty for these data is 2.6 .",
    "gj832 has also been observed with the planet finder spectrograph ( pfs ) @xcite on the 6.5 m magellan ii ( clay ) telescope .",

    "a further 54 velocities were obtained from a harps - terra @xcite reduction of the publicly available spectra and and are given in table  [ harpsvels ] .",
    "the aaps data are critical for constraining the long - period outer planet , and the extremely precise harps and pfs data are necessary for characterizing the inner planet .",
    "to account for possible intrinsic correlations in the radial velocities , we used the same statistical model as @xcite that assumes that the deviation of the @xmath1th measurement of a given instrument from the mean depends also on the deviation of the previous measurement .",
    "in other words , these deviations are correlated with a correlation coefficient of @xmath7 that decreases exponentially as the gap between the two measurements ( the difference @xmath8 ) increases .",
    "we set the correlation time - scale such that @xmath9 days @xcite .",

    "only for the harps - terra data does the correlation coefficient @xmath11 differ significantly from zero .",
    "we thus consider an additional data set in our analysis , `` harps - cr , '' which has been corrected for these intrinsic correlations .",
    "those data are also shown in table  [ harpsvels ] .",
    "gj832 ( hd204961 , hip106440 , lhs3685 ) is a very nearby m1.5 dwarf , lying at 4.95 pc @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the host star are summarized in table  [ stellarparams ] . while the original discovery paper for the giant planet @xcite did not note any residual signals of interest , @xcite combined aat ( @xmath12 ) and harps ( @xmath13 ) data to refine the planet s orbital parameters and mentioned a potential 35-day residual periodicity .",
    "they concluded that the data in hand did not yet warrant a secure detection as the false - alarm probability ( fap ) exceeded 1% .",
    "the aat data published in @xcite contained 32 epochs spanning 3519 d ( 9.6 yr ) . combining all available data",
    ", we now have 109 epochs covering a 15-year baseline , enabling us to better characterize the long - period planet , and increasing our sensitivity to any residual signals of interest .",
    "we analysed the combined harps , pfs , and ucles radial velocities in several stages .",
    "first , we drew a sample from the posterior density of a model without keplerian signals , i.e.  a model with @xmath14 , by using the adaptive metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is a generalization of the metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo technique @xcite that adapts the proposal density to the information gathered from the posterior .",
    "this baseline model enabled us to determine whether the models with @xmath15 keplerian signals were , statistically , significantly better descriptions of the data by estimating the bayesian evidence ratios of the different models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for this purpose , we used the simple estimate described in @xcite .",
    "the search for periodic signals in the data was performed by using tempered samplings @xcite such that a scaled likelihood @xmath16 and a scaled prior density @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the measurements and @xmath19 the parameter vector , instead of the common likelihood @xmath20 and prior @xmath21 .",
    "we choose @xmath22 low enough such that the posterior probability density is scaled sufficiently to enable the markov chains to visit repeatedly all relevant areas in the parameter space , the period space in particular . in this way",
    ", we can estimate the general shape of the posterior density as a function of the period parameter to see which periods correspond to the highest probability maxima .",
    "this is not necessarily possible with `` normal '' samplings ( i.e. when @xmath23 ) because one or some of the maxima in the period space could be so high and significant that the markov chains fail to visit the whole period space efficiently due to the samplings getting `` stuck '' in one of the corresponding maxima .",
    "this could happen because the parameter space around some maximum is in practice so much less probable that any proposed values outside the maximum are rejected in the mcmc sampling .",
    "the application of such tempered samplings thus enables an efficient search for periodicities in the data .",
    "we maximised parameter @xmath22 such that the period parameter visited all areas in the period space between one day and the data baseline during these tempered samplings .",
    "the results from this period search reveal the shape of the posterior probability density as a function of period ( see figure  [ dram ] ) .",
    "this enabled us to identify all relevant maxima in the period space because such transformation artificially decreases the significances of the maxima , while leaving their locations unchanged . to ensure that the markov chains visited all areas of high posterior probability in the parameter space , and especially through the period space , we applied the delayed - rejection adaptive - metropolis algorithm @xcite , where another proposed parameter vector from a narrower proposal density is tested if the first proposed vector is rejected .",
    "this enables an efficient periodicity search because the chains visit the narrow probability maxima in the period space .",
    "one such sampling is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ dram ] when searching for a second periodicity in the data .",
    "the chain clearly identifies a global maximum at a period of 35.7 days .",
    "after such tempered samplings , we started several `` cold chains , '' i.e.  normal chains such that @xmath24 , in the vicinity of the highest maxima to determine which of them were significant according to the detection criteria discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the statistical significance of a signal is quantified by the bayesian evidence ratio @xmath25 .",
    "we required that the bayesian evidence ratio be at least @xmath26 times greater for a model with @xmath27 than for a model with @xmath28 signals to state that there are @xmath27 signals present in the data .",
    "that is , the model with the signal must be 10000 times more probable than the model without . for the combination of the three data sets considered here , we obtain @xmath29 ( in favor of a one - planet model over zero planets ) .",
    "the 35-day signal is also significant with respect to our detection threshold as it is detected with @xmath30 .",
    "the maximum _ a posteriori _ estimates of the model parameters , together with the corresponding bayesian 99% credibility intervals , are listed in table  [ planetary_parameters ] .",
    "the data and best - fit models are shown in figure  [ mikkorvplots1 ] ( gj832b ) and figure  [ mikkorvplots2 ] ( gj832c ) .",
    "in addition to the velocities , various activity indices are also available for the epochs of the gj832 harps observations @xcite .",
    "those metrics , derived from the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) are the bisector inverse slope ( bis ) , described fully in @xcite , and the ccf full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we modelled correlations of the harps - terra velocities with bis , fwhm , and @xmath31-index by assuming these correlations were linear that represents the first - order approximation for such dependence .",
    "however , accounting for these correlations did not improve the model , which indicates that such linear correlations were insignificant .",
    "furthermore , when we computed the best - fit estimates for such linear correlation parameters , they were all consistent with zero , as shown in table  [ activity ] .",
    "the combination of three data sets with high precision and long observational baseline yields evidence for a second , low - mass planet orbiting gj832 . given that we have used data from every telescope which is able to achieve sufficient velocity precision for this southern m dwarf ( @xmath32@xmath33 ) , independent confirmation of gj832c is problematic .",
    "it is prudent , then , to employ an independent analysis to test the plausibility of the 35-day signal .    for this analysis",
    ", we use the harps data set which has been corrected for intrinsic correlations as described above  labeled here as `` harps - cr . ''",
    "an instrumental noise term was derived from the excess white noise parameter given in table  [ instrument_parameters] harps - cr : 1.33 , pfs : 1.45 , aat : 4.66 . before orbit fitting , that noise was added in quadrature to the uncertainties of each data point .",
    "we repeated our analysis using the unaltered harps - terra velocities , and found throughout that the harps - cr and harps - terra data sets gave the same results .",
    "first , we fit a single - planet model to the three data sets using the nonlinear least - squares minimization routine _ gaussfit _",
    "the velocity offsets between the three data sets were included as free parameters .",
    "the rms scatter about the three data sets are as follows  aat : 5.72 , harps - cr : 1.88 , pfs : 1.74 .",
    "we performed a periodogram search on the residuals to the one - planet fit , using the generalized lomb - scargle formalism of @xcite . unlike the classical lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite",
    ", this technique accounts for the uncertainties on the individual data points , which is critically important for the case of gj832 where we have combined data sets with significantly different precisions .",
    "the periodogram of the 1-planet fit is shown in figure  [ 1planetpgram ] ; the highest peak is at 35.67 days .",
    "the fap was estimated using a bootstrap randomization method @xcite . from 10,000 bootstrap realizations ,",
    "the 35.67-day peak is shown to be highly significant , with fap=0.0004 ( 0.04% ) .",
    "we then used a genetic algorithm to search a wide parameter space for two - planet models , and to check that any candidate secondary signal is indeed the global best - fit .",
    "our group has used this approach extensively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when the orbital parameters of a planet candidate are highly uncertain .",
    "we allowed the genetic algorithm to fit 2-keplerian models to the three data sets simultaneously , searching secondary periods from 10 to 3000 days .",
    "it ran for 50,000 iterations , testing a total of about @xmath34 possible 2-keplerian configurations .",
    "the genetic algorithm converged on @xmath3535 days , giving confidence that this is the most likely period for a candidate second planet .",
    "we then obtained a final 2-planet fit using _",
    "gaussfit_. again , we performed the fit twice , using the two versions of the harps velocities .",
    "the details of each fit are summarized in table  [ rms ] .",
    "both fits gave the same results , though the harps - cr set ( `` fit 2 '' ) gave a slightly better rms and smaller uncertainties on the planetary parameters - hence , we adopt those results in table  [ planetparams ] .",
    "these fits reveal a second planet , gj832c , with @xmath360.03 d and m  sin  @xmath370.95  on a nearly - circular orbit .",
    "a periodogram of the residuals to the 2-planet fit is shown in figure  [ 2plresids ] ; the highest peak at 40.2 days has a bootstrap fap of 0.0456 ( 4.6% ) .",
    "if the 35-day signal is real , adding data should result in a higher significance level , i.e. a lower fap determined by the bootstrap method described above @xcite .",
    "we test this by performing one - planet fits on various combinations of the three data sets considered here . in these fits ,",
    "the parameters of the outer planet are started at the best - fit values in table  [ faps ] , but are allowed to vary . for data combinations with insufficient time baseline to adequately fit the outer planet , its parameters are instead fixed at their best - fit values .",
    "after each fit , we removed the signal of the outer planet , examined the periodogram @xcite of the residuals , and computed the fap of the highest remaining peak using 10,000 bootstrap randomizations .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ faps ] .",
    "the aat data alone are not sufficiently precise to detect the @xmath382  signal of the candidate planet , nor did the addition of only 16 epochs from pfs enable the detection of any significant residual signals .",
    "nevertheless , we see in table  [ faps ] that the addition of data indeed strengthens the significance of the 35.6-day signal , adding confidence that the signal is real and not an artifact of one particular instrument .",
    "table  [ faps ] also indicates that the harps data are necessary to pull out the signal of gj832c , and the aat data , while noisy , are necessary for constraining the outer planet .    the next obvious question to ask is whether the detected signal is intrinsic to the star . as noted in @xcite and in section 3.1 ,",
    "the harps planet - search programs use the additional diagnostics bis and ccf - fwhm to check for star - induced variability .",
    "being contemporaneous with the velocity measurements , both of these measures can be directly compared with the velocity derived from a given spectrum . if bis or fwhm show correlations with the velocities , a candidate radial - velocity signal can be considered suspect .",
    "figure  [ bis ] plots the harps velocities ( after removing the outer planet ) against the bis ( left panel ) and the ccf fwhm ( right panel ) .",
    "no correlations are evident , and the highest bis periodogram peak at 179.6 days has a bootstrap fap of 17% . for fwhm ,",
    "the highest periodogram peak at 6322 days has a bootstrap fap@xmath390.01% . for comparison , the outer planet has a period of 3660 days , and the harps fwhm data only span 1719 days ; for these reasons , we maintain the conclusion of @xcite that the long - period velocity signal is due to an orbiting body . as shown in table  [ activity ] , none of these activity indicators had correlations significantly different from zero .",
    "these results are further evidence that the 35.6-day signal is not intrinsic to the star .      in recent years",
    ", a growing number of super - earths have been discovered that orbit their host stars at a distance that may be compatible with the existence of liquid water somewhere on the planet were it to have a surface ( i.e.  within the classical habitable zone ) .",
    "a list of these planets is given in table  [ habitable ] .",
    "of those planets , perhaps the most interesting are those orbiting gj581 . in that system , a total of six planets have been claimed , although at least two of these are still the subject of significant debate ( e.g. mayor et al . 2009 , vogt et al . 2010 , tuomi 2011 , von braun et al . 2011 , tadeu dos santos et al .",
    "2012 , vogt et al .",
    "2012 , baluev 2013 ) .",
    "the proposed planetary system around gj581 displays an orbital architecture that is strikingly similar to a miniature version of our own solar system .",
    "the similarity to our own solar system has recently been enhanced by the results of the debris survey ( matthews et al .",
    "2010 ) , which recently discovered and spatially resolved a disk of debris orbiting gj581 ( lestrade et al .",
    "2012 ) , analogous to the solar system s edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "we can estimate the location of the classical habitable zone following the prescriptions given in selsis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and kopparapu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , using the stellar parameters detailed in table  [ stellarparams ] . in both cases , we find that gj832c lies just inside the inner edge of the potentially habitable region - with the selsis et al .",
    "prescription yielding a habitable zone that stretches between 0.13 and 0.28 au , and the kopparapu et al .",
    "prescription suggesting that the conservative habitable zone for a 5   planet lies between 0.130 and 0.237 au , compared to the measured @xmath400.006 au for gj832c .",
    "although gj832c is sufficiently far from its host star that there is the potential for liquid water to exist on its surface , this does not necessarily make that planet truly habitable . indeed , there is a vast number of factors that can contribute to the habitability of a given exoplanet beyond the distance at which it orbits its host star ( e.g. horner & jones 2010 , horner 2014 ) .",
    "given the planet s proximity to its host star , it seems likely that gj832 c will be trapped in a spin - orbit resonance , though moderate orbital eccentricity may mean it is not necessarily trapped in a resonance that causes one side of the planet to perpetually face towards the sun . in our own solar system , the planet mercury is trapped in such a resonance : rotating three times on its axis in the time it takes to complete two full orbits of the sun .",
    "mercury s capture to that particular resonance is almost certainly the result of its relatively eccentric orbit ( e.g. correia & laskar 2009 ) - and so it is certainly feasible that gj832 c , whilst tidally locked , is not trapped in 1:1 spin - orbit resonance . even if the planet is trapped in such a resonance , however , that might not be deleterious to the prospects for its being habitable .",
    "for example , recent work by @xcite , employing a 3-dimensional general circulation model , suggests that planets with slower rotation rates would be able to remain habitable at higher flux levels than for comparable , rapidly rotating planets .",
    "given the planet s large mass , however , it is likely to be shrouded in a dense atmosphere - which might in turn render it uninhabitable . in that scenario ,",
    "the dense atmosphere would provide a strong greenhouse effect , raising the surface temperature enough to cause any oceans to boil away , as is thought to have happened to venus early in the lifetime of the solar system , e.g. kasting ( 1988 ) .",
    "kasting et al .",
    "( 1993 ) proposed that tidally locked planets around late - type stars might be rendered uninhabitable by atmospheric freeze - out if they were locked in a 1:1 spin - orbit resonance .",
    "however , such a massive atmosphere would also be able to prevent the freeze out of the planet s atmosphere if it were trapped in a 1:1 spin - orbit resonance ( heath et al .",
    "1999 ) . a detailed review of the potential habitability of planets around m dwarfs by tarter et al . ( 2007 )",
    "re - opened the possibility of habitability for such planets .",
    "more recently , @xcite have argued that the inner edge of the habitable zone moves inward for more massive planets  a scenario which would operate in favor of gj832c s habitability .",
    "given the large mass of gj832c , and the high probability of it having a thick , dense atmosphere , it is reasonable to assume that it is unlikely to be a habitable planet .",
    "however , it is natural to ask whether it could host a giant satellite , which might itself be habitable .",
    "speculation about habitable exomoons is not a new thing , and in recent years , a number of papers have been published discussing the prospects for such satellites orbiting a variety of newly discovered planets ",
    "e.g. the gas giants hd38283b ( tinney et al . 2011 ) , and hd23079b ( cuntz et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the super - earth kepler-22b ( kipping et al .",
    "2013 ) , or discussing the viability of such satellites as potential locations for life in a more general sense ( e.g. heller 2012 , forgan & kipping 2013 , heller & barnes 2013 ) . as such",
    ", it is interesting to consider whether gj832c could host such a potentially - habitable satellite , although we acknowledge that the detection of such a satellite is currently well beyond our means .    within our solar system , one planet ( the earth ) and several of the minor bodies ( such as pluto )",
    "are known to have giant satellites that are thought to have formed as a result of giant impacts on their host object toward the end of planet formation ( e.g. benz et al .",
    "1986 , canup 2004 , canup 2005 ) . in the case of the pluto - charon binary ,",
    "the mass of charon is approximately 1/9th that of pluto - were that extrapolated to the case of gj832c , it would result in a moon somewhat greater than half of the mass of the earth determined from radial velocity measurements would actually be the total mass of the exoplanet in question , plus any moons it hosts .",
    "for example , if gj832c hosts a moon with 20% of its own mass , then the planet mass would actually be only 0.8 times the m sin@xmath1 given in table  [ planetparams ] . ] . but could gj832c retain such a satellite whilst orbiting so close to its host star ?    the hill sphere of an object is the region in which its gravitational pull on a satellite ( or passing object ) would dominate over that from any other object . typically , within our solar system , the regular satellites of the planets orbit their hosts well within their hill sphere .",
    "our moon , for example , orbits at approximately one - quarter of the hill radius . for gj832c , assuming a mass of 5.406 times that of the earth , and a host - star mass of 0.45 , the hill radius would be just 0.00306 au - or 460,000 km . in and of itself",
    ", this result does not seem to preclude the existence of a habitable exomoon orbiting gj832c .",
    "however , cuntz et al.(2013 ) found that , for the case of the gas giant planet hd23079b , satellites on prograde orbits were only stable out to a distance of approximately 0.3 hill radii - a result that compares relatively well to the orbital distance of the moon , which currently orbits earth at a distance of @xmath41 hill radii .",
    "were the same true for the case of gj832c , this would reduce the region of stability , requiring that a satellite orbiting that planet must remain within an orbital radius of @xmath42 km in order to remain bound on astronomically long timescales .",
    "heller & barnes ( 2013 ) consider the possibility of habitable exomoons orbiting the super - earth kepler-22b and the gas giant planet candidate koi211.01 . by considering the influence of tidal heating on the potential satellites of these planets",
    ", they reach the conclusion that `` if either planet hosted a satellite at a distance greater than 10 planetary radii , then this could indicate the presence of a habitable moon . ''",
    "if we assume that gj832c is a predominantly rocky / metallic object , then we can obtain a rough estimate of its radius by following seager et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for a silicaceous composition , given a mass of approximately 5",
    ", it seems likely that gj832c would have a radius approximately fifty percent greater than that of the earth , or approximately 10,000 km .",
    "we can therefore determine a rough inner - edge to the circum - planetary habitable zone for gj832c , at approximately 10 times this value .",
    "in other words , for gj832c to host a habitable exomoon , potentially formed by means of a giant collision during the latter stages of planet formation , such a satellite would most likely have to orbit between  @xmath43 and @xmath42 km - a very narrow range .",
    "although the idea of a habitable exomoon companion to gj832c is certainly interesting , the odds seem stacked against the existence of such an object .",
    "we have combined high - precision radial - velocity data from three telescopes to detect a super - earth ( 5.4@xmath01.0 ) orbiting gj832 near the inner edge of the habitable zone .",
    "we attribute this detection to two key differences from the @xcite analysis .",
    "the first is that our bayesian techniques are better at picking out weak signals ; this was powerfully demonstrated by @xcite , who used this approach for the gj163 system and obtained results consistent with @xcite with only 35% of the harps data used in the discovery work .",
    "the second is that the harps - terra velocities are more sensitive to planet c than the velocities derived by the harps team in @xcite ; @xcite showed that harps - terra produces better velocities for m dwarfs .",
    "given gj832 s close proximity it is bright enough for high contrast imaging @xcite , even though it is an m - dwarf .",
    "however , due to its likely old , though uncertain , age even gj832b ( 0.63 ) would not be bright enough to be detected by the current state of the art instruments such as the gemini planet imager on gemini south @xcite . with a rare jupiter analog and a potentially rocky inner planet ,",
    "the gj832 system can be considered a scaled - down version of our solar system . with this in mind , it would be interesting to see if that analogy continues beyond the planetary members of the system to the debris .",
    "there is a growing body of work , based on _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ observations , revealing correlations between the presence of debris disks and planets ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as gj832 is very nearby ( 4.95 pc ) , it is an ideal candidate for future imaging efforts to search for debris disks akin to our own edgeworth - kuiper belt and main asteroid belt .",
    "recent work by @xcite showed a correlation between low ( sub - solar ) metallicity , low mass planets and an elevated incidence of debris from _ herchel _ data and radial - velocity results .",
    "as gj832 is quite metal - poor ( @xmath44=-0.3 $ ] ) , it would thus appear to be a promising target for debris detection .",
    "future observations of gj832 hold the promise to yield up further secrets from this intriguing system .",
    "circumstellar debris discs around mature stars are the byproduct of a planetesimal formation process , composed of icy and rocky bodies ranging from micron sized grains to kilometre sized asteroids ( see reviews by e.g. wyatt 2008 , krivov 2010 and moro - martin 2013 ) .",
    "the dust we actually observe is continually replenished in the disc through the collisional grinding of planetesimals as the grains are much shorter lived than the age of the host star , being removed by radiative processes and collisional destruction ( backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "since planets are believed to be produced through the hierarchical growth of planetesimals from smaller bodies and dust grains are produced through their collisional destruction , we expect the two phenomena to be linked .",
    "the solar system represents one outcome of the planet formation process , comprising four telluric planets , four giant planets and two debris belts - the inner , warm asteroid belt at 3 au ( backman et al .",
    "1995 ) and the outer , cold edgeworth - kuiper belt at 30 au ( vitense et al .",
    "we detect thermal emission from warm dust around 2@xmath02% of sun - like stars ( trilling et al . 2008 ) and cold dust around 20@xmath02% of sun - like stars ( eiroa et al .",
    "2013 ) ; such measurements are limited by sensitivity particularly for the warm dust . by comparison ,",
    "the solar system s debris disc is atypically faint , expected to lie in the bottom few percent of disc systems ( greaves & wyatt 2010 ) and currently beyond the reach of direct detection by ground or satellite observatories . around other stars , many host infrared excesses with two characteristic temperatures , typically at @xmath45150",
    "k and @xmath4550 k ( morales et al . 2011 ) .",
    "drawing an analogy to the solar system , discs with two temperature components are interpreted as being the product of physically distinct debris belts at different orbital radii . due to the tendency of dust to migrate away from the debris belt where it was created ( krivov et al .",
    "2008 ) , the presence of more or less narrow debris rings around a star has been attributed to the existence of unseen planet(s ) shepherding the dust and confining its radial location through dynamical interaction , creating observable warps , clumps , gaps and asymmetries in the disc ( moro - martin et al .",
    "2007 , morales et al . 2009 ) .",
    "several such cases of planets interacting with a debris disc have now been proposed , with candidate planets identified through direct imaging searches around several of the stars ( e.g. vega , wyatt 2003 ; beta pic , lagrange et al .",
    "2010 ; hd 95086 , rameau et al .",
    "2013 ) . indeed , planet - disc interaction has been vital in the formation and evolution of life on earth , with minor body collisions providing both a late veneer of volatile material to the earth s surface ( obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) , the migration of jupiter thought to be responsible for the late heavy bombardment at @xmath45800 myr ( gomes et al .",
    "2005 ) and subsequent infrequent catastrophic bombardment drastically altering the climate during the history of the solar system @xcite .",
    "therefore , any discussion of the potential habitability of an exoplanet should consider the possibility of volatile material delivery to a planet located in the habitable zone from remnant material located elsewhere in the system .",
