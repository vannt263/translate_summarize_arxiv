    "superconductivity is a remarkable macroscopic quantum phenomenon , which was discovered by kamerlingh onnes in 1911 . as temperature decreases to below a critical value , electric resistance of a superconductor vanishes and the magnetic field is repelled .",

    ", magnetic resonance imaging has been widely used in medical facilities .",
    "superconductors may be used to transport electricity without loss of energy . conventional superconductivity",
    "is well explained by bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory , which was established in 1957 . in a superconducting ( sc ) state , two electrons with opposite momenta attract each other to form a bound pair .",
    "the pairing mechanism in a conventional superconductor is due to couplings between electrons and phonons , which are quantum version of lattice vibration .",
    "the transition temperatures ( @xmath0 ) are , however , very low , and usually well below 40 kelvin ( k ) .",
    "the low transition temperature has greatly limited practical applications of superconductors .",
    "it has been a dream to realize high @xmath1 or room temperature superconductors , which may revolutionally change the power transmission in the world .",
    "there was a great excitement after the discovery of high @xmath1 sc cuprate by bednorz and m@xmath2ller in 1986 , who reported @xmath3 well above 30 k in la@xmath4ca@xmath5cuo@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent world - wide efforts in search of high @xmath1 sc cuprate raised the transition temperature beyond the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77k for the first time  @xcite and the highest @xmath1 at ambient pressure is 135k in hg - based cuprates , which remains the record as of today .",
    "all the cuprates share a common structure element cuo@xmath7 plane , where cu atoms form a square lattice .",

    "soon after this discovery , the transition temperature has been raised to above 40k at ambient pressure by substitution of different elements  @xcite .",

    "study of iron based superconductors and their physical properties have been one of the major activities in condensed matter physics in the past several years . at the time when the iron based superconductor was discovered ,",
    "scientists in the field of superconductivity were well prepared .",
    "several powerful new techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscope ( arpes ) , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , have been well developed during the course of studying high t@xmath12 cuprates .",
    "these techniques together with some more conventional techniques such as neutron scattering , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , optical conducting measurements , have been applied to examine the properties of the new compounds .",
    "iron based superconductivity shares many common features with the high @xmath1 cuprates . both of them are unconventional superconductors in the sense that phonons unlikely play any dominant role in their superconductivity .",
    "both are quasi - two dimensional , and their superconductivity is in the proximity of antiferromagnetism . on the other hand , iron based superconductors have a number of distinct properties from the cuprates .",
    "the parent compounds of the sc cuprates are antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulators due to strong coulomb repulsion , and the lightly doped superconductors are doped mott insulators  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the parent compounds of iron based superconductors are semi - metallic .",
    "dynamic mean field calculations indicate that the iron based compounds are close to metal - insulator transition line but are at the metallic side  @xcite . in the curpates ,",
    "the low energy physics is described by a single band  @xcite , while in the iron - based compounds , there are multi orbitals involved . despite over 25 years of study , some of the physics in the cuprates remain controversial .",
    "the investigation of iron based superconductors may help us to understand the unconventional superconductivity and also provide a new route for searching higher temperature superconductors .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide an overall picture of the iron based superconductivity based on our present understanding . instead of giving a broad review to cover all the experimental and theoretical developments in this field",

    "the dramatic difference in the fermi surface topologies indicates that the pairing is local in the real space , mediated by short range antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "finally , we note that although a general experimental phenomenology has been established , there are still many remaining open issues to be addressed . for example , in the recent fese / sto studies , it was suggested that the interface has a non - trivial role on the superconductivity , and particularly the interfacial phonon might play an important role @xcite .",
    "theory of high - t@xmath12 superconductivity remains one of the most fundamental and challenging problems .",
    "the bcs theory fails to explain why the sc transition temperatures for both cuprate and iron - based superconductors can be much higher than the possible upper limit for electron - phonon mediated superconductors ( 40 k ) @xcite .",
    "the highest @xmath151 k of iron - base superconductors  @xcite is still much lower than that for the cuprate superconductors ( 164 k under high pressure ) .",
    "however , the study for the iron - based superconductivity is of particular interest because ( 1 ) fe@xmath152 ions have magnetic moments which are generally believed to be detrimental to superconductivity , the discovery of high - t@xmath12 superconductivity in iron pnictides has overturned this viewpoint and opens a new direction for exploring new superconductors ; ( 2 ) there are strong af fluctuations in iron - based superconductors and the investigation to these materials may help us to understand more deeply the pairing mechanism of high - t@xmath12 superconductivity in general .",
    "iron - based superconductors , including iron pnictides and iron chalcogenites , are quasi - two - dimensional materials .",
    "they have very complicated electronic structures and competing interactions .",
    "to understand the mechanism of iron - based superconductivity , the first task is to establish the minimal model to describe the low energy electronic excitations in these materials .",
    "a key issue under debate is whether the system is in the strong or weak coupling limit , since the interaction that drives electrons to pair can be very different in these two limits .      from first principles density",
    "functional theory ( dft ) calculations , we know that the low energy excitations of electrons in iron - based superconductors are mainly contributed by fe 3d electrons . at high temperatures , iron pnictides / chalcogenides are paramagnetic metals . at low temperatures ,",
    "most of parent compounds , including lafeaso , bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 and other 1111 and 122 pnictides , fete , are in the af metallic phase .",
    "they become sc upon electron or hole doping . for lafepo , lifeas or other 111 pnictides , the parent compounds without doping are sc at low temperatures .    as an example , fig .  [",
    "fig : ba122-band ] shows the fermi surface and the band structure for bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 in the high temperature paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "similar band structures are found for other iron pnictides @xcite and chalcogenides @xcite . in general",
    ", there are five bands across the fermi surface . among them are two electron - like fermi surfaces centered around @xmath153 and its equivalent points and two hole - like fermi surfaces centered around the zone center @xmath154 . for 1111 or hole doped 122 materials , in addition to the above four surfaces ,",
    "there is one more hole - like fermi surface appearing around @xmath155 .",
    "this band is more three - dimensional like than the other four bands and shows a large energy - momentum dispersion along the c - axis .",
    "the band structure of the single - layer fese grown on srtio@xmath11 substrate is relatively simple @xcite .",
    "there are only two bands , located around @xmath156 and @xmath157 , across the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the qualitative feature of the band structures obtained by the dft calculation agrees with the arpes measurements .",
    "but the band width and the effective mass of electrons around the fermi surface are found to be strongly renormalized by correlation effects which are ignored in the dft calculation .",
    "as@xmath7 in the folded brillouin zone .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are the sectional views of the fermi surface through symmetrical k - points @xmath155 and @xmath126 perpendicular to the @xmath158-axis , respectively .",
    "( from ref .",
    "@xcite).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      our discussions on minimal model below will be based on strong coupling point of view , where we consider the electron interaction is strong .",
    "the weak coupling viewpoint starts with itinerant electrons and treats electron interaction as a perturbation .",
    "the weak coupling theories may explain a number of experiments in iron - based superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "however , they have difficult to explain local magnetic moments and superconductivity in systems without fermi surface nesting . among the five 3d orbitals of fe ions , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath122",
    "contribute most to the low energy excitations .",
    "these orbitals couple strongly with each other and with the other two fe 3d orbitals , @xmath159 and @xmath146 , by the hund s rule exchange interaction . in the atomic limit",
    ", an fe@xmath152 ion possesses a large magnetic moment , @xmath160 , with a total spin @xmath161 .",
    "when fe atoms form a crystal by hybridizing with as and other atoms , these 3d electrons may become itinerant .",
    "if all 3d orbitals of fe become highly itinerant , one would expect that the magnetic moment of fe will be completely quenched .",
    "however , neutron and other experimental measurements indicate that the magnetic moments of fe remain finite at least for most of undoped or slightly doped iron pnictides / chalcogenides @xcite .",
    "for example , the ordering moment of fe in the antiferromagnetic ordered state is about 0.37@xmath162 for lafeaso  @xcite , 2@xmath162 for fete  @xcite and 3.31@xmath162 for k@xmath7fe@xmath6se@xmath37  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the fermi surface nesting effect can not give such a large ordering moment and the magnetic moment of fe must have the contribution from electrons whose energy is well below the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the total moment of an fe ion is a sum of the ordering moment and the fluctuating moment .",
    "the fluctuating moment results from thermal and quantum fluctuations of fe moment and is zero on average .",
    "a small ordering moment does not mean the total moment of an fe spin is also small .",
    "the total moments in most of 1111 and 122 pnictides can in fact be much larger than the ordering moments , which suggests strong quantum fluctuation in the parent compounds .",
    "the existence of fe moments in these materials means that not all fe 3d electrons are equally conducting , some of them are more localized than the others . from the first principles density functional calculation",
    ", it was found that the crystal splitting of the 3d orbitals is small , but the hybridization between fe and as / se atoms and the on - site coulomb interaction vary differently for different 3d orbitals .",
    "this may lead to an hund s rule coupling assisted orbital selective mott transition @xcite and allocate a finite magnetic moment for each fe by localizing some 3d orbitals .",
    "thus fe 3d electrons possess both local and itinerant nature .",
    "the low energy charge dynamics is governed by itinerant 3d electrons and behaves more like in a conventional metal with weak correlation , whereas the spin dynamics is essentially governed by localized moments and behaves more like in a strong coupling system .",
    "moreover , these itinerant electrons and local moment are not independent , they are actually coupled together by the hund s rule coupling .",
    "this is similar as in a colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganate where the double exchange interaction induced by the hund s coupling between localized and itinerant electrons is important .",
    "of course , the coulomb screening of conduction electrons to the local moments is stronger in fe - based materials .",
    "this may explain why the magnetoresistance is fairly large in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase in fete or other fe pnicides materials .",
    "iron - based materials exhibit various antiferromagnetic orders .",
    "these orders are driven predominantly by the magnetic interactions between fe spins , among them the most important one is the superexchange interaction between fe spins mediated by as or se 4p electrons @xcite .",
    "the superexchange interaction depends on the hybridization between 3d and 4p orbitals , in particular on the bond length and the angle of fe - as - fe . besides this",
    ", there is also a direct ferromagnetic exchange interaction between two fe ions , which is determined by the wavefunction overlap between two 3d orbitals on the two neighboring fe sites .",
    "these exchange interactions are short ranged which extends mainly to the nearest and next nearest neighbors for fe pnictides or fe selenides , and to the third next - nearest neighbors for fe tellurides @xcite .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the minimal model for describing iron - based superconductors is approximately given by @xcite @xmath163 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the orbital quantum number of itinerant electrons , and @xmath164 .",
    "the first term is the tight binding hamiltonian of itinerant electrons .",
    "the second and third terms are the exchange interactions between fe spins on the nearest and next nearest neighboring sites , respectively .",
    "if one ignores the charge fluctuation and considers only the spin dynamics , this hamiltonian reduces to the @xmath165 model @xcite . in this case , the ground state is collinear af ordered if @xmath166 .",
    "this is indeed the af order that is observed by neutron scattering measurements @xcite in most of the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors . in passing we",
    "note that the minimal model approximates the spin - spin couplings independent of the five d - orbital , and has not included hund s rule interaction .    in iron - based superconductors , the difference between center momenta for the electron and hole bands , i.e. @xmath167 and @xmath126 , coincides with the characteristic wave vector of the @xmath63 term .",
    "thus the @xmath63 term couples strongly with the electron and hole fermi surfaces .",
    "this term is believed to play an important role in driving both af and sc orders .",
    "if the hole and fermi surfaces are perfectly nested , then the @xmath63 coupling will be strongly amplified in the phase space integration , leading to certain fermi surface nesting effect , such as the spin density wave instability .",
    "doping can change the phase space that is connected by the nesting vector , which can strengthen sc order and weaken af order , or vice verse .",
    "in general , the competition between sc and af correlations is strong in these materials .",
    "the sc order emerges when the af order is suppressed .      in a sc phase ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are suppressed by the sc long range order and the bcs mean field approximation is valid . the pairing gap of electrons is an order parameter characterizing a sc state .",
    "physical properties in a sc state can be well described by the bcs theory once the gap function is known .",
    "this is the reason why the gap function is of particular interest for study .",
    "while a non - s - wave symmetry may indicate unlikely phonon mediated pairing , the pairing symmetry alone is not sufficient to determined the pairing interaction .",
    "the gap symmetry is determined by the pairing interaction .",
    "if the pairing is induced by electron - phonon interaction , it is generally expected that the energy gap has s - wave symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "if the pairing is induced by af fluctuations , a spin singlet d - wave ( for example in high - t@xmath12 cuprates ) or spin triplet p - wave ( for example in @xmath168 ) pairings are possible , depending strongly on the band structure , especially on the structure of fermi surfaces .",
    "this is because the sc pairing is a low energy effect and involves only excitations of electrons around the fermi surface .",
    "for the same pairing interaction , the gap symmetry may change with the change of the fermi surface .",
    "the gap symmetry is classified according to the point group of crystal .",
    "theoretical study suggested that the pairing gap of iron - based superconductors has conventional s - wave symmetry @xcite , namely in the identity representation of point group . this has been confirmed by spectroscopy and transport measurements on most of iron - based superconductors including ba@xmath9k@xmath10fe@xmath7as@xmath7 , bafe@xmath4co@xmath10as@xmath7 , kxfe@xmath4se@xmath7 , and fete@xmath9se@xmath10 .",
    "however , for kfe@xmath7as@xmath7 , bafe@xmath4ru@xmath10as@xmath7 , and nearly all phosphorus - based superconductors , lafepo , lifep , and bafe@xmath7as@xmath4p@xmath10 , it was found that gap nodes exist .",
    "the presence of gap nodes generally implies that the pairing symmetry is unconventional , although an extended s - wave pairing may have accidental nodes on one or more fermi surfaces .",
    "fe - base superconductors are multi - band systems .",
    "there are several bands across the fermi level .",
    "even if we assume that the pairing has s - wave symmetry , the relative phases of gap functions can be different on different fermi surface , depending on inter - band pairing amplitudes to be attractive or repulsive .",
    "if the gap function has the same phase on all the fermi surfaces , the pairing is said to have @xmath148 symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , if the gap function has opposite phases on different fermi surfaces , the pairing is said to have @xmath169 symmetry .",
    "the relative phase of the gap function is determined by the interaction between cooper pairs on different bands . for iron - based superconductors ,",
    "if the pairing is induced by the af fluctuations , interaction between cooper pairs on the electron and hole bands will generally be repulsive . in this case , the sc phases are opposite on the hole and electron fermi surface , and the gap function has @xmath169 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , if the pairing is induced by the orbital fluctuation and the sc instability happens in the @xmath170 channel , the interaction between cooper pairs on the electron and hole bands is attractive , and the gap function will have @xmath148 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus , from the relative phases in the gap function , one can determine whether the sc pairs are glued by af fluctuations or by orbital fluctuations .    in the literature ,",
    "there are quite many discussions on the phase structure of the gap function .",
    "however , this phase structure is not in the angular orientation , and is not sensitive to most experiments .",
    "it is actually very difficult to resolve unambiguously this seemly simple phase problem  @xcite . for a @xmath169 superconductor",
    ", it is expected that a strong neutron resonance peak exists around the momentum linking hole and electron fermi surfaces , i.e. at @xmath171 and equivalent points .",
    "this resonance peak has in fact been observed in nearly all iron - based superconductors @xcite , lending strong support to the theory that predicts the pairing to have @xmath169 symmetry . from the experimental observation of quantum interference of quasiparticles with magnetic or nonmagnetic impurities , it was also found that a @xmath169 pairing is more likely @xcite . on the other hand , from anderson theorem ,",
    "it is well known that non - magnetic impurity scattering does not affect much on the transition temperature for @xmath148 superconductors , but it may reduce strongly the transition temperature for @xmath169 superconductors . in particular , the transition temperature of a @xmath169 superconductor should decrease with increasing impurity concentration . however , for iron - based superconductors , the critical transition temperature does not depend much on the quality of samples .",
    "this seems to suggest that the @xmath148 pairing is more favored .",
    "more systematic study of various impurity effects provides mixed information  @xcite , which may suggest non - universal behavior on the relative phases in iron - based superconductors , in contrast to the universal d - wave pairing in high t@xmath12 cuprates .",
    "the sc and af orders are two competing orders .",
    "generally they repel each other . however , if the pairing has @xmath169 symmetry , theoretical calculation suggested that these two kinds of orders can coexist @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this kind of coexistence has indeed been observed in bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 , ba@xmath9k@xmath10fe@xmath7as@xmath7 and smfeaso@xmath9f@xmath10 with co substituting fe or with p substituting as @xcite , and in k@xmath5fe@xmath7se@xmath7 .",
    "but in these systems in which the co - existence was observed , the sc gap was also found to have line nodes .",
    "it is unknown whether the coexistence is caused by the @xmath169 pairing symmetry or by the line nodes , or the other way around .",
    "in this article , we have reviewed a number of physical properties of iron - based superconductor . during the past six years",
    ", tremendous progress has been achieved in the synthesis of materials , growth of single crystals , characterization of crystal structures , and measurements of thermodynamics , transport and various spectroscopic quantities for iron - based superconductors .",
    "this has given us a comprehensive understanding on the chemical and crystal structures , band structures , spin and orbital orderings , pairing symmetry and other physical properties of iron - based superconductors .",
    "in particular , the normal states of fe - based superconductors have multiple fermi surfaces including electron fermi pockets and hole fermi pockets .",
    "this indicates importance of multi - orbitals in these materials .",
    "fe - based superconductors are proximate to antiferromagnetism , which suggests that af fluctuations are responsible for the observed superconductivity",
    ".    studies on the mechanism of iron - based superconductivity is an important part of research on the mechanism of high - t@xmath12 superconductivity .",
    "any progress in this direction may have strong impact on the study of theory of strongly correlated quantum systems . to investigate the sc mechanism",
    ", one needs to find out the microscopic origin that causes the pairing of electrons and establish a theory that is capable to explain existing experimental data and to predict new experimental effects .",
    "this remains a challenging task .",
    "similar to the cuprate superconductivity , iron - based superconductivity is generally believed to originate pre - dominantly from the electron - electron repulsive interaction , which induces af fluctuations .",
    "superconductivity induced by af fluctuation has recently been reviewed by scalapino  @xcite . in the present theories based on af fluctuation ,",
    "one approximates the pairing vertex solely in terms of the exchange of af fluctuations .",
    "this should be reasonable in some cases such as heavy fermion superconductivity , where the sc state is near the af quantum critical point . in cuprates , there is also the mott physics . in iron based sc materials , we have argued that the systems are in strong coupling limit .",
    "furthermore , the system may well have orbital selected mott physics .",
    "theoretical description of high tc superconductivity in both cuprate and iron based superconductivity remains a grant challenge .",
    "iron based superconductors are multi - band materials .",
    "all five 3d orbitals of fe hybridize strongly with as or se 4p orbitals .",
    "they also couple strongly with each other and have contribution to both itinerant conducting electrons and localized magnetic moments .",
    "this brings much complexity to the understanding and explanation of experimental phenomena .",
    "we are lacking a clear physical picture with reliable theoretical tools to treat an electronic system with strong coupling between itinerant and localized electrons .",
    "theoretical study for iron - based superconductors relies more on phenomenological analysis of experimental observations and on various approximations .    in short ,",
    "the iron - based sc mechanism is a challenging problem . to solve this problem",
    ", we need to further improve the quality of single crystals and the resolution of measurements .",
    "besides the routine measurements and characterizations , it is more important to design and carry out smoking gun experimental measurements to solve a number of key problems , for example the problem whether the gap function has the @xmath169 symmetry . this will reduce greatly the blindness in the theoretical study and leads to a thorough understanding of iron - based superconductivity .",
    "fe - based materials have highest sc @xmath1 next to cuprate . their discovery has greatly encouraged search for other superconductors with higher t@xmath12 . while we are still far from the stage to predict high t@xmath12 materials , there is good progress along this development .",
