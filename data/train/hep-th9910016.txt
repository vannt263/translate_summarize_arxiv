    "a new prediction of the correspondence between type iib superstring on @xmath3 and @xmath0=4 supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theory with @xmath1 gauge group  @xcite is that a certain class of @xmath4-point correlation functions , represented by  extremal correlators \" of chiral primary operators ( cpo s ) , satisfy some non - renormalisation theorem . in @xcite , dhoker , freedman , mathur , matusis and rastelli",
    "have argued that type iib supergravity requires the above @xmath4-point functions to decompose into products of @xmath5 free - field two - point functions .",
    "moreover the overall coefficient was argued not to be renormalised with respect to its free field value .",
    "something similar is known to happen for two- and three - point functions of cpo s  @xcite as well as for the chiral  @xcite and weyl  @xcite anomalies corrections to the chiral anomaly are reproducible in terms of one - loop corrections to the lowest order supergravity approximation due to the absence in the bulk of the would - be singleton fields  @xcite . ] .",
    "the extremal correlation functions we consider are of the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",

    "the correlator ( [ qextrcorr ] ) is `` extremal '' in that there is only one @xmath11 invariant contraction of the ( implicit ) `` flavour '' indices , _",
    "i.e.  _ there is only one @xmath11 singlet in the product of the representations with dynkin labels @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath14 $ ] ,  , @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to show that extremal correlators of cpo s are neither renormalised at first order in perturbation theory nor receive contribution from any instanton sector at leading order in the semiclassical expansion .",
    "the non - renormalisation properties displayed by extremal correlators of cpo s at first order in perturbation theory suggest that the strong version of the argument proposed in @xcite on the basis of the ads / scft correspondence should be valid . one might then expect that any extremal correlators , either involving single - trace operators or multi - trace operators , should be independent of the coupling constant @xmath16 , hence tree - level exact , for any finite @xmath17 . if this were the case no higher derivative term in the type iib superstring effective action should be capable of giving a non - vanishing amplitude of this kind .",
    "@xmath18 invariance of type iib superstring requires that string loop corrections to higher derivative terms be accompanied by non - perturbative d - instanton corrections .",
    "it is by now widely appreciated that the counterpart of type iib d - instantons in the ads / scft correspondence are sym instantons @xcite .",
    "these are responsible for interesting @xmath19 violating processes such as a 16-dilatino amplitude , that has been used for a quantitative test of the ads / scft correspondence @xcite , as well as for some @xmath19 preserving processes such as the higher derivative corrections to the four stress - tensor / graviton amplitude .",

    "after briefly reviewing the description of @xmath0=4 supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory in terms of @xmath0=1 superfields , we demonstrate the vanishing of the lowest perturbative correction to the extremal correlators .",
    "we then pass to describe the fermion zero - mode counting in instanton backgrounds and show that non - perturbative corrections are absent as well .",
    "finally we comment on the bearing and extension of our results in view of the ads / scft correspondence .",
    "we would like to stress that the results we are going to show are valid both for single- and for multi - trace operators in the relevant @xmath11 representation and for any number of colours @xmath17 , suggesting the validity of the non - renormalisation theorem well beyond the reach of the lowest supergravity approximation , valid at large @xmath17 and large t hooft coupling .",

    "@xmath106 can be written in terms of the adhm data and their superpartners that satisfy some complicated non - linear constraints , collectively denoted by @xmath107 in the following .",
    "the only crucial point is that the `` true '' zero - modes neither enter the non - linear `` super - adhm constraints '' @xmath108 nor the fermion - quadrilinear term in the classical action .",
    "taking into account the yukawa couplings ( in @xmath0=1 notation ) @xmath109 + \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{ijk } \\phi^i [ \\lambda^j ,       \\lambda^k ] + ~{\\rm h.c . }",

    "the scalar - field solutions induced by the presence of the fermionic zero - modes in ( [ eqmot ] ) are @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a bilinear in the lifted gaugino zero - modes of `` flavour '' 0 and 1 only , and @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a bilinear in the lifted gaugino zero - modes of `` flavour '' 2 and 3 only .",
    "substituting the instanton - induced expressions for the scalar fields in the extremal correlators ( [ extrcorr ] ) yields @xmath116 where , except for an obvious @xmath117 factor , the measure of integration @xmath118 and the explicit form of the `` super''-adhm constraints @xmath108 are independent of @xmath119 s and play no rle in the following . since only the first operator",

    "in fact in the case of three- and higher - point functions extremality requires @xmath123 . for two - point functions of cpo s , that are always extremal , the values @xmath124 are allowed .",
    "the corresponding correlators have vanishing instanton correction at lowest order because the 16 geometric zero - modes can not be saturated in these cases .",
    "this proves the non - perturbative non - renormalisation of extremal correlators of cpo s with any number @xmath4 of insertion points and for all @xmath17 and @xmath101 to leading order in the semiclassical expansion around the instanton background .",
    "we will not dwell into the study of perturbative corrections to the above instanton result , but we expect them to vanish as much as perturbative corrections around the trivial vacuum configuration vanish .",
    "the extension to any gauge group , though technically involved , should be straightforward .",
    "the results presented in this letter lend firm support to a new prediction of the ads / scft correspondence @xcite , well beyond the regime of validity of the supergravity approximation .",
    "it would be extremely useful to fully characterise the class of correlators that are ( expected to be ) tree - level exact in @xmath0=4 sym theory . from a preliminary analysis of cpo s correlators",
    ", it seems that this interesting class could be restricted to those correlators that involve only one @xmath11 singlet .",
    "in addition to the extremal correlators that we have considered above , two- and three - point functions of cpo s belong to this class .",
    "as observed above , all two - point functions and some three - point functions are extremal too .",
    "tests of the predictions arising for these cases from the ads / scft correspondence @xcite have been performed from the sym perspective both at one - loop @xcite and at the non - perturbative level @xcite . judiciously using the `` bonus '' @xmath19 symmetry @xcite in the context of @xmath0=4 analytic superspace  @xcite and disposing of some potentially troublesome contact terms @xcite lead to a demonstration of the non - renormalisation of two- and three - point functions of cpo s  @xcite .",
    "the identification of @xmath19-violating nilpotent super - invariants that began at five points and above @xcite and were not listed in @xcite prevents one from generically extending the same argument to higher - point functions .",
    "proving the absence of the relevant nilpotent super - invariants should allow one to prove the absence of quantum corrections to the extremal correlators of cpo s by simple algebraic means .",
    "a related issue is whether the knowledge of correlators of cpo s completely determines those of their super - descendants or there are other nilpotent super - invariants that can spoil this naive expectation",
    ".    it would be interesting to see whether the @xmath0=4 analytic superspace analysis could also shed some light onto the non - renormalisation properties of protected multi - trace operators that satisfy more general shortening conditions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the vanishing of their anomalous dimensions is supported by explicit perturbative and non - perturbative computations ( _ e.g .",
    "_ for a dimension four double - trace operator in the @xmath125 representation of the @xmath11 r - symmetry ) at weak coupling @xcite , but it is still waiting for an ads confirmation .",
