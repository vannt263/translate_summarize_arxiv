    "high precision astrometry is often supported by metrology , either on ground or in space .",
    "an example of the former case is the control of atmospheric disturbances in long baseline interferometry , typically in the near infrared range @xcite , and of the overall instrument geometry @xcite , for narrow to medium angle astrometry .",
    "the latter case is mostly aimed at measurement or control of the configuration of a macroscopic instrument to a small fraction of wavelength , for astrometry from intermediate to large angle @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing aspect of space experiments is that usually the precision goal is referred to a much more compact telescope than ground based instruments , translating the requirements into a much narrower fraction of the diffraction limit ; therefore , the constraints on image modeling @xcite and calibration @xcite become correspondingly more challenging .",
    "metrology usually employs interferometric combination of laser beams to meet the precision goal thanks to the high photon flux .",
    "as opto - electronic systems become more and more complex , the metrology signal may be affected by a number of implementation aspects , potentially introducing errors .",
    "the data processing algorithms become then a performance factor , as their limitations might compromise part of the potential precision associated to the hardware design .",
    "we address a set of algorithms suited to the relative phase of multiple fringe patterns from two - beam laser interferometry , in particular the low - level , short range automated processing providing the relevant information to higher level diagnostics software and to the scientists evaluating the system response .",
    "the current work is focused mainly on the application to the gaia metrology sub - system , although the concept is quite general and could be applied , in the future , to other high precision astrometry experiments @xcite .",
    "the gaia mission @xcite is aimed at global astrometry at the few micro - arcsec ( hereafter , @xmath0 ) level , producing an all - sky catalogue of position , proper motion and parallax , complete to the limiting magnitude @xmath1 .",
    "the gaia concept relies on self - consistency of the astrometric information of celestial objects throughout operation , factoring out the instrument parameters and their evolution by calibration of the overall data set .",
    "the hipparcos experience suggests that the approach is viable with respect to detection and modeling of the instrumental parameter secular evolution and long term variations , over time scales longer than a few revolution periods , i.e. above about one day .",
    "gaia takes advantage of the simultaneous observations of two telescopes mounted on a common high stability torus to measure precisely the relative positions of stars in regions of the sky separated by a wide _ basic angle _ @xmath2 .",
    "perturbations to the instrument geometry induce displacements of each telescope _ line of sight _",
    "( los ) ; the common mode displacement of the two telescopes does not affect the measured angular separation between stars , and appears as a disturbance of the overall instrument , with an effect similar to attitude jitter , i.e. a small degradation of image sharpness .",
    "however , the differential los perturbation appears as a _ ba variation _ ( bav ) , which affects directly the astrometric measurement of star separation .",
    "the design specifications are derived from the short term astrometric performance requirements , corresponding to a ba stability @xmath3 . in order to ensure that the short term stability requirement is actually met throughout operation , a custom on - board metrology system is also integrated in the payload design , the _ basic angle monitoring _ ( bam ) device @xcite .",
    "the metrology concept is based on pairs of collimated beams from a laser source , split by a dedicated distribution system in front of the gaia astronomical telescopes , and following an optical path very close to that of the stellar photons to generate an interferometric pattern on a dedicated section of the focal plane .",
    "the rationale is that perturbations to the optical configuration , affecting the position of the stellar images on the focal plane , i.e. the basic ingredient of the astrometric measurement , would affect also the bam beam path , and therefore the interferogram phase .",
    "the match between astronomical and metrology photons is not complete , e.g. because the laser beam hits a much smaller region of the optical system , but it is assumed that the most relevant variations of the telescope geometry will also induce an effect on the interferogram phase , which is monitored , allowing for estimation of astrometric corrections to be applied in the data reduction , if required .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : signalchar ] we present the main characteristics of the signal , and in sec .  [ sec : algordef ] we define accordingly the algorithm concepts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] we evaluate the performance achieved with a simple implementation of such algorithms ; then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of their usage within the gaia data reduction scheme .",
    "the bam design provides a fringe pattern with period comparable with the stellar image size in the high resolution direction , detected by a ccd similar to the science ones used for object detection , astrometry and photometry . the interferogram can be considered as a large set of artificial stars , coherently providing an instrumental phase information .",
    "the bam concept is based on two assumptions :    * small amplitude of the instrument perturbations to be monitored ; * high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the latter conditions leads to a potential measurement precision corresponding to a small fraction of the interferogram period , thus making the device suitable to fulfill the former requirement .",
    "the actual relationship between the interferogram phase and the telescope pointing direction is unknown , depending on the actual optical configuration , but is it assumed that , in the expected small perturbation regime , they will concide apart an offset , or `` zero point '' .",
    "the ba variation , i.e. the variation of the angle between the telescope observing directions , is thus referred to variation of the relative phase between the interferograms . in particular , correlated phase variations are associated to common mode telescope pointing errors , and differential phase variations to more critical ba variations affecting the astrometric measurement .    in the medium to long period , the ba variation measured by the bam device can be calibrated with respect to its corresponding value on the sky , as deduced by convenient combination of observations , e.g. variation in the angular separation among stars at different epochs .",
    "the comparison between bam measurements and astrometry will therefore provide an assessment of science quality throughout the mission .",
    "the interferogram associated to an ideal bam , feeding an ideal telescope , is the point spread function of the unobstructed circular aperture related to the individual laser beams , modulated by fringes with the young period .",
    "practical implementation introduces deviations from such simple framework , because of optical aberrations due to design , manufacturing and alignment in the metrology distribution system and in the telescope .",
    "also , the laser beam intensity is not uniform over its cross section , but it is expected to be described e.g. by a truncated gaussian .    this still generates a useful signal @xcite with high contrast fringes within a more complex diffraction envelope",
    ". the fringe period is basically preserved , but the phase modulation bears contributions from the real system . also , the envelope has generally larger size , and significant shape variation , with respect to the ideal case .",
    "however , it is expected that the crucial information of ba variation is still encoded in the mutual relationship between interferograms .",
    "in particular , the small ba variations expected during operation will introduce interferogram displacements on the @xmath0 scale , with amplitude much smaller than the fringe period .",
    "the bam device , by design , generates an interferogram for each telescope , imaged in different positions of a common dedicated ccd .",
    "each signal is affected by its own photon shot noise , background ( depending on the current pointing position ) , and comparable readout noise .",
    "photon noise is expected to be the main contribution , since the laser source intensity is tuned in order to use most of the detector dynamic range .",
    "gaia bam interferogram ; dashed rectangle : readout area , width=283,height=188 ]    section of two one - dimensional fringe patterns , integrated across fringe , width=283,height=188 ]    the bam is based on a geometry similar to that of young s interference experiment , in which the two slits are replaced by small beams with diameter @xmath4 , separated by a baseline @xmath5 , generating on the focal plane a modulated signal , i.e. an interferogram , with @xmath6 fringes , limited by the diffraction envelope of the individual aperture .",
    "the two telescopes are fed by separate beam pairs , generating similar interferometric spots on the detector ; the fringe period is @xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9  pixels .",
    "the interferogram from each telescope is repeatedly measured , at a rate of an image every @xmath10 .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the beam pair monitoring one telescope , to the related optical system , and to the corresponding detected signal , as a `` bam channel '' .",
    "only a limited region of interest over the central lobe of diffraction is actually acquired , for each bam channel , as shown by the dashed rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringepattern2d ] .",
    "the interferogram is integrated across the fringes after readout , in order to achieve a more easily tractable one - dimensional signal , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringepattern1d ] . since the fringe patterns are mostly aligned to the ccd array , to within @xmath11 , only a marginal smearing is introduced .",
    "the laser source is monochromatic , but the interferometric signal , due to the limited beam diameter and associated fringe envelope size , has a spatial frequency distribution spread over the approximate range @xmath12 $ ] . a detailed mathematical description of the fringe pattern is not easily formulated except in the simplest geometric cases , due to optical aberrations .",
    "however , most phase estimation algorithms are based either on a template , or on assumptions on the mathematical characteristics of the signal , i.e. they are _",
    "model dependent_. given the bam readout frequency and high snr , it is possible to define a numerical _ signal template _ , as well as its empirical variance , both deduced from a convenient set of measured data , rather than analytical formulation of a signal model whose parameters have to be estimated e.g. by best fit to the measurements .",
    "it is possible to define algorithms aimed at providing a phase estimate for each interferogram , related to the average los position of the individual telescope , from which the bav is simply deduced by difference of the phase values at each time .",
    "we focus on a set of simple concepts leading to convenient algorithm implementation , and evaluate their main impact on the measurements .",
    "we also address a _ model independent _ measurement concept , providing a direct estimate of the bav as phase difference between the fringe patterns , without individual phase computation .",
    "a model dependent approach is expected to be , in principle , more precise , because the expected characteristics of the signal are taken into account .",
    "however , this requires that additional information is available to define at least the signal template and variance , as in sec .",
    "[ sub : templatedef ] .",
    "hereafter we expand on some of the possible approaches , which will then be tested on simulated data .",
    "from a sufficient number @xmath13 of measurement of the interferometric signals @xmath14 related to each telescope , it is possible to define the sample approximations @xmath15 of the corresponding templates , or noise free reference functions , from the signal averaged over the data set : @xmath16 the dependence on the pixel position @xmath17 and on the current exposure time @xmath18 has been shown explicitly , but it will be omitted below where not necessary for the sake of simplicity .    we define in a similar way the empirical variance @xmath19 of each interferogram pixel as @xmath20^{2 }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sigvar}\\ ] ]    this approach is based on the assumption that the measurement conditions are stationary , so that the average can be considered as a reasonable approximation of the template .",
    "the phase noise on the fringes is assumed to be much smaller than the fringe period , by a factor of @xmath21 , in normal conditions .",
    "however , phase noise will induce errors on the template and variance estimate , in addition to the amplitude fluctuations due to photon noise .",
    "it can be shown that photon noise , in the expected conditions , is dominant ; thus , the small fringe displacement among subsequent instances does not introduce a significant blurring of the mean fringe , which can be considered a reasonable approximation to the desired signal template .    in the numerical experiments below ,",
    "the template is built by averaging over @xmath22 frames , so that the expected reduction of individual measurement noise is of order of @xmath23 .",
    "the data set also provides an estimate of the signal dispersion through the sample variance , so that subsequent measurements can then be checked for consistency with the template and the initial data ( e.g. in terms of confidence levels ) . for each bam channel , a specific template",
    "is defined by averaging the corresponding data set from a suitable measurement sequence .",
    "the signals from the two bam channels are not exactly sinusoidal , but they have a very narrow spectrum , resulting in a significant modulation at the same nominal spatial frequency .",
    "their envelopes are not equally shaped , but over the readout region their amplitude is quite high .",
    "the signal similarity leads to the possibility of processing them with a simple approach based on the correlation technique .",
    "the two quasi sinusoidal signals will have a maximum correlation value for a given displacement with respect to each other , which in the example shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fringepattern1d ] is of order of two pixels .",
    "a perturbation to whichever telescope , inducing a phase variation on the corresponding interferogram , will modify accordingly the position of the signal correlation maximum .",
    "therefore , this algorithm defines a linear variable strictly related to the relative position of the interferograms , and as a consequence of the basic angle variation between telescope lines of sight .",
    "_ we adopt the estimate of this relative interferogram phase as an operational definition of the ba estimate , in order to monitor its variation around an irrelevant zero point to be calibrated on the sky from science data . _ this approach , by construction , gives a position estimate modulo the fringe period , which is not an `` absolute '' datum .",
    "the relative displacement of the two fringe patterns can be estimated directly by computation of the maximum correlation position between them , e.g. from parabolic fit of the three correlation values achieved for lag zero and @xmath24  pixel .",
    "this approach completely avoids the issue of template definition ; broadly speaking , the interferogram from each channel acts as a template for the other . in practice",
    ", the method does not need that the two signals are very similar to each other ( which would improve on the correlation value ) , but only that their shape remains approximately stable over the time frame required for calibration on the sky through the science data .    in more detail ,",
    "the two signals are arrays of 500 values ; given their offset of about two pixels , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringepattern1d ] , they are roughly `` aligned '' by removing the first value on the former and the last one on the latter , i.e. reducing the data to @xmath25 values .",
    "the offset is due to the simulated placement of readout windows ; it is constant over the simulation , due to the small phase noise .",
    "the lag zero signal is then selected as the central part of the array with index @xmath26 , i.e. excluding the end values .",
    "the lag @xmath24 signals include respectively either of the end values , discarding the opposite ending value , i.e. with indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the correlation is then computed over @xmath29 values . +",
    "this windowing approach sacrifices a small part of the signal , but it avoids data interpolation , or extrapolation at each end of the arrays .",
    "processing is fast , as only array indexing is used .",
    "the mismatch between signals from each bam channel suggests that the noise performance of this algorithm may not be optimal , but its advantages are the simplicity and robustness , so that it is applicable also in a context of limited knowledge of the instrument parameters , e.g. at the beginning of operation or after unexpected events inducing large perturbations .",
    "it also provides a simple sanity check for other algorithms .      in the expected operating conditions ,",
    "the interferometric signal is quite stable , therefore we assume that it is possible to apply the approach of sec .",
    "[ sub : templatedef ] to define its model ( or template ) by averaging the measurements according to eq .",
    "[ eq : template1 ] .",
    "as far as only small perturbations are present , the individual signal instances will be consistent with such signal template , apart from fluctuations in amplitude ( e.g. from photon noise ) and phase ( related to the ba variation ) .    for any fringe pattern instance , we compute the correlation with the template , in its nominal position , and with @xmath24  pixel offset . the indexing of sec .",
    "[ sub : mutualcorr ] is used for definition of the lag zero and @xmath24 signals .",

    "_ the difference between los values is considered the operational definition of the ba , so that its variation can be used for monitoring .    in stable conditions , each los is expected to fluctuate around zero , since each signal instance is close to its template within the noise ; similarly , the ba estimate is expected to be centered in zero .",
    "correlation is a robust and proven technique , but it is known to provide sometimes less than optimal noise performance .",

    "bav discrepancy vs. input bav , width=283,height=207 ]      the snr of this data set is still very high with respect to usual astronomical data , but significantly lower than the previous case , of order of @xmath65 for both los  1 and los  2 signals , corresponding to the nominal bam operation level . from the results of sec .",
    "[ sub : noiseperf ] , this corresponds to an expected astrometric noise level of order of @xmath66 .    the simulation results evidence a noise level of @xmath67 , consistent with the expectations .",
    "the algorithm behaviour with respect to signal perturbations , including intensity increase by @xmath68 for channel 1 , and @xmath69 for channel 2 , is again limited to a bav `` jump '' of about @xmath66 .",
    "the results from mc , ct and ml remain quite consistent with each other .",
    "also , the signal variation is clearly evidenced by the reduced @xmath32 .",
    "the performance of low - level algorithm on bav noise and linearity has been verified on different data sets at the @xmath0 level or better , consistently with the snr limit . in spite of its simplicity ,",
    "the model free approach ( mc ) achieves noise performance within a few percent of the template based ct and within @xmath70 of the ml limit .",
    "mc results are also quite consistent with those from ct , but with lower sensitivity to measurement `` jumps '' induced by some signal changes .",
    "the ml approach takes full advantage of the available information , thus resulting in best noise performance and very little sensitivity to the perturbations simulated in the data sets used .",
    "the availability of different algorithms with comparable sensitivity , and somewhat different response to signal disturbances , may help in detecting perturbations throughout operation by evidencing their effects , and minimising their impact on the science measurements by appropriate corrections introduced in the data reduction .",
    "the low - level algorithms do not perform any interpretation of the signal variation simulated in data set 1 , in terms of estimation of relevant system parameter change , however they provide a clear diagnostics of its occurrence through the @xmath71 , and the bav estimate error is retained within the specifications .",
    "the reduced @xmath32 evidences oscillations around unity value on the data set 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2_ds1_2 ] ) , even using the matching template and variance for each data subset .",
    "this is assumed to be related to the extremely high snr , and correspondingly very low measurement noise . in such circumstances ,",
    "the simple procedure used to build the signal template and variance seems to be insufficient , e.g. because the input phase variation induces signal variations not negligible with respect to those associated to photon noise . the fluctuations on ml estimates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dbav_mc_ct_ml ] ) , in phase with the bav , appear to be consistent with this scenario .",
    "such oscillations are no longer present in the reduced @xmath32 and bav computed on data set 2 .",
    "the current simple approach appears to be adequate to the gaia mission requirements , even in spite of the large simulated signal variations , resulting in systematic errors compatible with the micro - arcsec noise level associated with the snr range expected for the gaia bam operation .",
    "it may be noted that , with the gaia pixel size @xmath72 , the best precision case of data set 1 , of order of @xmath59 , corresponds to a few micro - pixels , thus matching well the simulations and experimental results in @xcite .",
    "the minimisation of signal model error , according to sec .",
    "[ sub : templatedef ] , requires large amounts of data to average out the noise fluctuations .",
    "besides , this may reduce the sensitivity to disturbances acting on a time scale shorter than the period of data accumulation .",
    "a suitable trade - off must therefore be defined .",
    "we investigate algorithms aimed at low - level processing of metrology signals from two laser beam , high dilution , imaging metrology systems , with particular reference to the gaia bam device .",
    "the methods range from a model free approach based on mutual correlation ( mc ) , to others using progressively more detailed information , including the signal template ( ct ) , and the signal variance ( ml ) .    the numerical model of the signal",
    "is derived by computing the average fringe pattern and its variance over a convenient data set , which may be easily verified for self - consistency , and has minimal dependence on external parameters : mainly pixel size and optical scale to convert linear results ( fractions of pixel ) into angular values .",
    "the performance is verified at or below the @xmath0 level by simulation on data sets generated either in house , or by independent groups , ranging from the noiseless case to comparably large perturbations .",
    "the model free approach still provides quite appealing performance , while the maximum likelihood method features lowest noise and sensitivity to disturbances . some signal disturbances , including profile variation and up to @xmath73 intensity variation , induce discontinuities in the measured positions of order of @xmath66 , within the design specifications .",
    "the signal variation is anyway clearly identified by @xmath71 diagnostics .",
    "the performance of all low - level algorithms appears therefore to be of interest for application to the data reduction of the gaia basic angle monitoring device , and potentially to future high precision astrometry experiments .",
    "the activity described in this paper is partially supported by the contract asi i/058/10/0 .",
    "we acknowledge the contribution of the coordination unit 2 ( cu2 ) of the gaia data processing and analysis consortium ( dpac ) for the generation of the bam data used for some of our tests .",
    "such data have been simulated on the supercomputer mare nostrum at barcelona supercomputing center ( centro nacional de supercomputacin ) .",
