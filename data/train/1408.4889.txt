    "spin waves ( sws ) are fundamental elementary excitations in magnetically ordered solid systems .",
    "originally , the concept of sw was proposed to explain the famous @xmath2 law of the temperature dependence of saturation magnetization .",
    "thereafter , the existence of sws was confirmed by many experiments , and sws became a basic ingredient in the field of magnetism and magnetic materials .",
    "thanks to the rapid development of micro - structuring technology , even the manipulation of the propagation of sw itself in periodic magnetic structures , dubbed magnonic crystals ( mcs ) @xcite , becomes feasible nowadays . in practice , this degree of freedom in the manipulation of sw dynamics paves the route to information processing employing sws .",
    "however , most of the contemporary studies involve only patterned magnetic domains and antiferromagnetically coupled nanowires @xcite , the role of magnetization texture still awaits for investigation @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of topological magnetization textures into the building elements of mcs would not only enlarge the horizon of the quest for new types of mcs , but also benefit from the additional tunability coming along with the response of magnetization textures to externally applied magnetic field @xcite or electric current @xcite .",
    "actually , the interplay between topology and sw has already attracted theoretical interest , both in mcs @xcite and in topological magnon insulators @xcite .    despite of the superficial different behaviour exhibited by dws and sws ,",
    "they are closely related to each other : sws are the propagating excitation of a ferromagnet , while the wavefunction of the zero mode excitation of a ferromagnet is just the derivative of the dw profile @xcite . here",
    ", we will consider the 1d band structure where there is a 2@xmath3 domain wall ( dw ) , which is the simplest topological entity in magnetic materials @xcite , in the unit cell of a mc . by analytically solving the sw eigenequation",
    ", we demonstrate that the topological nature of the underlying dw is transferred to the berry phase experienced by the sw . due to this topological nature of the berry phase",
    ", the vector potential giving rise to the berry phase determines a different magnonic band structure , compared to the band structure of an identical conventional mc composed of only uniform domains .",
    "we believe that the same topological effect is also effective in the skyrmion - based dynamic mcs @xcite , given that the homotopy group of both 2@xmath3 dws and skyrmions is identical @xcite .",
    "the fundamental unit cell of a domain - wall magnonic crystal ( dwmc ) is shown schematically in fig .",
    "it is composed of two regions , region 1 and region 2 . in our coordinate system ,",
    "region 1 extends from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and region 2 is bounded by @xmath5 and @xmath6 planes .",
    "the magnetic materials in the two regions could be identical or different . for a usual mc , in order to induce an energy gap for sws , the magnetic parameters of the two regions have to be different , which can be realized by using different materials or local modification of the magnetic properties of the same material through ion implantation @xcite . in our simplified 1d treatment of dwmcs , what matters is the magnetic parameters in the two regions , which are differentiated by the subscripts 1 and 2 for regions 1 and 2 , respectively . for concreteness of the problem , we assume both regions have uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along the @xmath7-axis and the mc structure is patterned from a continuous film lying in the @xmath8 plane .     component of the magnetization vector , @xmath9 , in the unit cell of 1d dwmc .",
    "region 1 ( uniform domain region ) is from @xmath10 to 0 , and region 2 ( dw region ) from 0 to @xmath11 . for the case of a conventional domain mc , the two region",
    "are occupied by two different magnetic materials and the 2@xmath3 dw shown here is absent . for a dwmc , materials in the two regions could be identical or different .",
    "although the dw shown here is a 2@xmath3 dw , @xmath3 dws can also be included in a dwmc .",
    "the corresponding unit cell for a dwmc with @xmath3 dws is more complicated than the unit cell shown here . ]",
    "the organization of our discussion of dwmcs is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sws ] , we give the sw eigenfunctions by solving the linearized magnetization dynamics . with those magnonic eigenfunctions , the band structure of mcs composed of both single domains and domain walls inside the unit cell is studied in sec .",

    "[ gap ] , the dependence of the magnonic band gaps and widths on magnetic material parameters will be investigated . using the method of transfer matrix , the evolution from free propagating sws without band gaps to sws characterized by band structure is described in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ discussion ] discusses the possibility of creating dwmcs in experiments .",
    "before proceeding to the actual band structure of the mc , we first need to know the sw eigenmodes in each material .",
    "this requires the solution of the corresponding landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite . without an externally applied magnetic field and neglecting the damping term",
    ", the llg equation for the normalized magnetization vector @xmath12 reduces to @xmath13 with @xmath14 the cutoff frequency for sws and @xmath15 the dw width constant .",
    "@xmath16 is the exchange stiffness constant , and @xmath17 the uniaxial anisotropy constant .",
    "@xmath18 is the anisotropy field , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the saturation magnetization . _ in eq .",
    "( [ llg ] ) , we consider only a perpendicular anisotropy field . in our simplified 1d treatment of the sw dynamics ,",
    "the demagnetization energy simplifies to two uniaxial anisotropies , one in plane and the other perpendicular to the film plane @xcite .",
    "the latter can be incorporated into the interface perpendicular anisotropy field , forming an effective perpendicular anisotropy field .",
    "inclusion of the former , in - plane demagnetization anisotropy in the form of a hard - axis anisotropy will only change the dispersion relation , making no difference to the understanding of the physics responsible for the formation of magnonic bands .",
    "non - uniform dynamic demagnetization field @xcite can cause localization of sws , and affect the sw modes in nanomagnets . since we are interested in the influence on the magnonic dispersion relation of a periodic structure , we consider only the lowest lying mode with parabolic - like dispersion curves .",
    "inclusion of higher modes will introduce more complex structures to the bands obtained with only the lowest mode , which is out of the scope of the current paper .",
    "_ for the 1d geometry considered here ( fig . [ cell ] ) , the gradient operator reduces to a differentiation on the @xmath21 variable , since the periodic structure of the mc is along the @xmath21-axis and we consider only magnetization variation along this direction .    in the ground state , which is derived from the static llg equation , @xmath22",
    "is uniformly magnetized along the easy ( @xmath7 ) axis in region 1 , @xmath23 . to obtain the sw eigenfunction , a single harmonic deviation from the uniform solution",
    "is considered , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a vector in the film plane , thus perpendicular to the ground state magnetization direction @xmath26 .",
    "substitute this form of @xmath22 back into the llg equation and retain only the first order terms of @xmath25 , we can get the sw eigenequation @xmath27 where the abbreviation @xmath28 is employed to make the equation compact .",
    "let @xmath29 , then the eigenequation for @xmath30 has a scalar form @xmath31 the sw dispersion relation @xmath32 and the eigenfunction @xmath33 follows immediately .",
    "it is interesting to note that , except for the existence of an excitation gap , whose direct cause is the finite anisotropy field , the sw dispersion relation is identical to that of an electron travelling freely , whose effective mass is determined by the exchange constant and saturation magnetization only .    in region 2 ,",
    "the procedure to obtain the sw eigenfunction is essentially identical to that for region 1 .",
    "the main difference is that , instead of a single domain state , there is a 2@xmath3 bloch dw present .",
    "a @xmath3 dw can also be considered .",
    "we choose a 2@xmath3 dw simply because the corresponding unit cell is simpler .",
    "since a detailed derivation of the magnetization profile for a confined dw and the corresponding sw eigenfunction is given in ref .",
    "[ ] , we will only describe the outline here .",
    "for brevity , in the following discussion of the dw magnetization profile and sw eigenfunction , the origin of the coordinate will be temporarily shifted to @xmath34 .",
    "the ground state dw profile is described by a cosine jacobian elliptic function @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the magnetization tilt angle in the @xmath37 plane , measured from the @xmath7 axis , and @xmath38 is the first kind complete elliptic integral .",
    "the modulus @xmath39 is determined by the length of region 2 , @xmath40 . _ due to the continuous rotation of the magnetization vector , the sw excitation is oscillating in a plane perpendicular to the local magnetization vector .",
    "viewed in this perpendicular plane , the sw oscillation is identical to that of a single domain , which is discussed above , except that the oscillation now is elliptical . hence , although the sw oscillation is vectorial globally , it is locally oscillating in a plane .",
    "the global 3d characteristics of the sw oscillation is restored if the rotation of the oscillating plane is considered .",
    "this feature of the sw excitation guarantees that we can use again a scalar function to describe sws inside dws . by rotating the @xmath7-axis to the local magnetization direction , and taking into account of the elliptical characteristics of the sw oscillation ,",
    "the scalar sw eigenequation becomes _",
    "@xmath41 _ @xmath42 is an auxiliary constant related to @xmath43 through @xmath44 _ , and sn is the sine jacobian elliptic function .",
    "this equation has the form of a schrdinger equation with an elliptic potential , known mathematically as the lam equation @xcite .",

    "this halving of the real space periodicity indicates a doubling of the @xmath45-space periodicity for sws , which is 4@xmath46 .",
    "this difference in periodicity of the sw and the static magnetization is caused by the insensitivity of sws to dw chirality and polarity .     as a function of the spatial coordinate @xmath21 at 15 ghz .",

    "( [ phi ] ) , periodic boundary condition was employed . from eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , it is obvious that the direct consequence of the introduction of magnetic dws is to modulate the sw eigenfunction , which now has the form of a modulated plane wave .",
    "the origin of the modulation on the eigenfunction can be traced back to the periodic potential appeared in the eigenequation for the sw . due to this periodic potential",
    ", the wavefunction should have the form of a bloch wavefunction , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a periodic function with the period of the potential . to cast @xmath30 into this form",
    ", the crystal wave - vector has to be defined as @xmath55 .",
    "the constant @xmath56 corresponds to the first brillouin zone boundaries . due to this displacement of the dispersion relation , there are two energy minima in the first brillouin zone for sws in the dw , and they are located at the zone boundaries .",
    "interestingly , there is no band gaps opening in the whole brillouin zone , although the potential function is periodic . the modulation function @xmath54 is given by @xmath57 , which now satisfies @xmath58 .",

    "[ wavefunction ] , where the real and imaginary parts of the modulation function @xmath54 at the frequency of 15 ghz are shown .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although @xmath54 is periodic with the same periodicity of the potential , its phase changes 2@xmath3 after a displacement of the period of the potential , which corresponds to a @xmath3 rotation of the magnetization vector .",
    "a 4@xmath3 phase is achieved when another period of the potential is displaced , and the magnetization rotation is correspondingly 2@xmath3 . from this observation , the phase shift of @xmath54 and",
    "the magnetization rotation of the dw is proportional to each other .",
    "the phase of @xmath54 , @xmath59 , is a berry phase @xcite , in contrast to the dynamical phase related to the crystal momentum .",
    "the magnetization rotation divided by 2@xmath3 is defined as the winding number @xcite @xmath1 in the configuration space .",
    "therefore , the berry phase of sws in the dw is proportional to the winding number , which is a topological quantity .",
    "the relation between @xmath59 and the winding number , @xmath60 , confirms that the sw berry phase inherits the topological character of the underlying dw .",
    "the potential in the schrdinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ dwequation ] ) , and hence the whole hamiltonian , are invariant under spatial inversion , which implies that the eigenfunction can be chosen to have definite parity .",
    "the function @xmath30 , however , does not have a definite parity . under the operation of spatial inversion ,",
    "@xmath30 is transformed to @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the complex conjugate of @xmath30 .",
    "eigenfunctions with definite parity can be constructed from @xmath30 and @xmath62 . due to the cpt theorem",
    "@xcite , consecutive action of time reversal and spatial inversion will leave @xmath30 intact , given that magnons are charge neutral particles .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian for sws in the dw is invariant under time - reversal operation , and @xmath30 and @xmath63 form time - reversal and space - inversion pairs . due to the time reversal symmetry , or equivalently , the inversion symmetry",
    ", the berry phase of sws with opposite @xmath45 will have opposite signs , signifying the different topological charge associated with positive or negative @xmath45 .",
    "as far as time reversal symmetry is conserved , the back scattering of magnons at the brillouin boundaries will be prohibited , thus forbidding the corresponding band gap opening .",
    "this is consistent with the calculated sw energy spectrum .",
    "_ at this point , it should be emphasized that the dependence of the berry phase on the crystal momentum is the consequence of the conservation of the time reversal symmetry , in contrast to the non - reciprocity of sw propagation @xcite , which requires the violation of the time reversal symmetry .",

    "the topological character of the berry phase is easier to observe in the 2d @xmath73 configuration space .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the difference between the crystal momentum and the vector potential - like field @xmath66 can be observed as the magnonic band structure reconfiguration induced by the presence of the dw in the unit cell .",
