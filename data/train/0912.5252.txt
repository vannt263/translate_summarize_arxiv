    "the fundamental equations which describe the time evolution of a collisionless plasma in the presence of large velocities are given by the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system ( rvm ) .",
    "the simplest form of these equations that retains electromagnetic effects can be obtained by posing the problem in one space dimension and two momentum dimensions , the so - called `` one and one - half '' dimensional system with a single species of ion :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the relativistic velocity .",
    "if one further assumes that the field components @xmath2 and @xmath3 are initially zero and the number density @xmath4 is initially even in @xmath5 , then these qualities persist for all @xmath6 , and the system reduces to the `` one and one - half '' dimensional relativistic vlasov - poisson system :    @xmath7    here , it should be noted that @xmath8 depends on two components of momentum .",
    "finally , if one wishes to consider a classical system without relativistic effects , then the velocity is represented by @xmath9 and not @xmath10 . in this way",
    ", one then obtains the `` one and one - half '' dimensional classical vlasov - poisson system : @xmath11 though the difference between ( [ rvp ] ) and ( [ vp ] ) seems quite subtle ( merely a `` hat '' on @xmath12 is included or excluded ) , it is well - known that the behavior of these two systems can drastically differ .",
    "this will be further highlighted by theorem [ thm1 ] which displays a significant difference in the long - time dynamics of the charge density when comparing the classical and relativistic systems . in each of the systems above @xmath13",
    "represents time , @xmath14 is position , @xmath9 represents momentum , @xmath15 and @xmath3 are electric and magnetic fields , @xmath4 is the number density in phase space of particles , and all physical constants , including the particle mass and speed of light , have been normalized . + in addition to the monocharged problems ( [ rvp ] ) and ( [ vp ] ) , we will consider the analogous neutral problems that include an arbitrary number @xmath16 species of ion , given by : @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , where we have a vlasov equation for the number density @xmath19 of each species indexed by @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the charge of the @xmath22 species .",
    "again , the @xmath19 depend upon two components of momentum @xmath23 and @xmath5 , and physical constants , such as particle mass , have been normalized . in the cases of ( [ rvpn ] ) and ( [ vpn ] )",
    ", we will assume the condition of neutrality @xmath24 which , by conservation of charge , guarantees @xmath25 for all @xmath13 .",
    "another main focus of the paper will be to demonstrate the differences in qualitative behavior which arise when one compares monocharged and neutral plasmas , such as ( [ rvp ] ) with ( [ rvpn ] ) or ( [ vp ] ) when compared with ( [ vpn ] ) .",
    "this is displayed by the differences in large time behavior of particle momenta for the systems ( theorems [ thm3 ] , [ thm4 ] , [ thm5 ] , and [ thm6 ] ) .",
    "+ over the past twenty years , considerable progress has been made regarding the well - posedness of classical solutions to the cauchy problem for vlasov - maxwell and vlasov - poisson set in a variety of dimensions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "though the issue of smooth global existence for arbitrary data remains an open question in three dimensions for both relativistic problems , it has been proven for many lower - dimensional analogues , such as ( [ rvm ] ) ( see @xcite ) , as well as , for the classical vlasov - poisson system posed in three dimensions ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , it is well known that solutions of ( [ rvp ] ) , ( [ rvpn ] ) , ( [ vp ] ) , and ( [ vpn ] ) remain smooth for all @xmath13 with @xmath26 , or @xmath27 for multi - species problems , compactly supported for all @xmath13 , assuming that the data possess the same properties .",
    "while these existence theorems have contributed greatly to the mathematical understanding of the equations , very few results concerning time asymptotic behavior have appeared in the literature . due to the so - called `` dilation identity '' , some time decay is known for vlasov - poisson in the classical , three - dimensional case ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , there are time decay results for the monocharged plasma ( [ vp ] ) when @xmath4 is independent of @xmath5 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the only known results regarding long - time behavior for a relativistic plasma were obtained in @xcite and , more recently , @xcite . these deal with",
    "the three - dimensional , monocharged problem with spherical symmetry and the one - dimensional , neutral problem with two species , respectively .",
    "references @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are also mentioned since they deal with time - dependent rescalings and time decay for other kinetic equations .",
    "we cite @xcite as a general reference regarding the study of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "+ due to the large assortment of phenomena that may be exhibited by plasma of different species , one expects the behavior to be quite complicated and depend on many factors , including the size of the total charge , the sign of the net charge , and the variety of ionic species that are involved . for simplicity , we focus on cases in which the plasma is monocharged ( i.e. , composed of a single species of ion ) or is composed of an arbitrary number of species and satisfies the condition of neutrality ( i.e. , possesses zero net charge )",
    ". hence , the methods used in the previously mentioned articles do not apply . the present work",
    ", then , seeks to determine information regarding the large time behavior of solutions to ( [ rvp ] ) , ( [ vp ] ) , ( [ rvpn ] ) , and ( [ vpn ] ) under these conditions .",
    "we remark that all of the results which follow will continue to hold in the strictly one - dimensional case , in which the number density @xmath4 ( or @xmath19 if multiple species are considered ) is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "however , we keep the @xmath5 dependence throughout because solutions to these equations also satisfy ( [ rvm ] ) , thereby providing some information regarding time asymptotics in this case .",
    "in addition , a previous result @xcite concerning a neutral plasma in one dimension did not readily generalize to the case in which @xmath5 is included .",
    "thus , we believe it necessary to present the more general results for the `` one and one - half '' dimensional problems , rather than asking the reader to believe that one - dimensional results could be easily extended to this case . of course , we are also interested in the long - time behavior of ( [ rvm ] ) , and this problem is explored in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "+ throughout the paper , we make the assumption that the initial data @xmath28 , or in the case of multiple species @xmath29 , are @xmath30 and compactly supported .",
    "we first consider the relativistic , monocharged case ( [ rvp ] ) and state the main result that , unlike solutions in the classical case , those which satisfy ( [ rvp ] ) do not give rise to a charge density that decays in time .    [ thm1 ]",
    "consider ( [ rvp ] ) and assume @xmath31 is not identically equal to zero , then there exists @xmath32 such that @xmath33 for all @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "since @xcite showed some time decay for solutions to ( [ rvpn ] ) , in the case @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath19 independent of @xmath5 , this theorem displays the distinct difference in behavior between monocharged and neutral plasmas , even in a one - dimensional setting .",
    "hence , the dispersive effects which occur in the neutral case seem to be a stronger or more influential phenomena than the repulsion of the monocharged case .",
    "additionally , while @xcite showed that the charge density decays in sup - norm like @xmath37 for the classical , monocharged system ( [ vp ] ) with @xmath4 independent of @xmath5 ( and the argument can be extended to include solutions of ( [ vp ] ) ) , we find here that the charge density does not decay in any @xmath38 norm for the relativistic , monocharged system ( [ rvp ] ) .",
    "thus , we have differing asymptotic behavior depending upon the inclusion or exclusion of relativistic velocity corrections .",
    "this can be contrasted with horst s discovery @xcite that solutions to both the classical and relativistic 3d vlasov - poisson systems satisfy the same time decay estimates under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "+ for these systems , the time asymptotic behavior of solutions will depend strongly on characteristics . since we are first interested in ( [ rvp ] ) , define the associated characteristics @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath41 then , in addition to lower bounds on the charge density , we can also determine a uniform upper bound under a very general assumption .",
    "[ thm2 ] consider ( [ rvp ] ) and assume there is @xmath42 such that@xmath43 .",
    "then , @xmath44 and @xmath45    for each of these systems it is well - known that @xmath46 is constant due to charge conservation .",
    "hence , using theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] and interpolation with @xmath46 , we may conclude in the case of ( [ rvp ] ) that @xmath47 is @xmath48 for any @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "finally , we can also sharply determine the asymptotic behavior of particle momenta for large time .",
    "[ thm3 ] let @xmath50 be a solution of ( [ rvp ] ) and define @xmath51 then , there are @xmath52 such that for @xmath53 , we have @xmath54    to further display differences in behavior between monocharged and neutral plasma , we consider the multi - species problem ( [ rvpn ] ) . since attractive forces among particles are now introduced , one intuitively expects that the particle momenta are asymptotically slowed in comparison to those of ( [ rvp ] ) .",
    "this is accurate and demonstrated by the following theorem .",
    "[ thm4 ] let @xmath55 satisfy ( [ rvpn ] ) for @xmath20 and define @xmath56 then , there is @xmath57 such that for any @xmath13 we have @xmath58    next , we turn our attention to the classical , monocharged problem ( [ vp ] ) . as opposed to ( [ rvp ] ) , time decay of the charge density is known from @xcite , so one may expect faster growth of particle momenta , as well . however , since the electric field terms are the same , the momenta are shown here to grow at exactly the same rate as in the relativistic case .",
    "[ thm5 ] let @xmath50 be a solution of ( [ vp ] ) and define @xmath51 then , there are @xmath52 such that for @xmath53 , we have @xmath54    finally , to contrast the result for ( [ vp ] ) , we may show that particles travel at slower speeds in the neutral case ( [ vpn ] ) .",
    "in fact , using very different techniques than the proof of theorem [ thm4 ] , we obtain the same bound on growth as for the momenta in ( [ rvpn ] ) .",

    "the proofs of theorems [ thm3 ] and [ thm5 ] will be combined since they use similar techniques .",
    "section @xmath60 then contains the proof of theorem [ thm4 ] , while section @xmath61 contains the proof of theorem [ thm6 ] . throughout the paper , `` @xmath62 '' will denote a generic constant which may change from line to line and depend upon initial data , but not on @xmath63 , or @xmath12 .",
    "however , constants with subscripts ( e.g. , `` @xmath64 '' ) will denote the same numerical value .",
    "throughout this section , we will make great use of the monocharge assumption , which implies @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 .",

    "<S> these equations are considered in one space dimension and two momentum dimensions in both the monocharged ( i.e. , single species of ion ) and neutral cases . the behavior of solutions to these systems is studied for large times , yielding estimates on the growth of particle momenta and a lower bound , uniform - in - time , on norms of the charge density . </S>",
