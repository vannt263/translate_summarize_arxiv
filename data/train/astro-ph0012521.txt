    "jets and outflows are ubiquitous in quasars and active galaxies .",
    "they are often superluminal , moving almost at the speed of light . over the last decade , a few sources in our own galaxy",
    "have been observed which also display energetic outflows .",
    "most interesting of these sources is the black hole candidate grs1915 + 106  @xcite which has been studied very extensively and in this review we shall devote some space on this object .",
    "extensive work has been carried out over last quarter of a century to explain the origin of jets  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , most of these invoke accretion flows to be the source of outflowing matter . since the standard keplerian accretion disk by shakura & synyaev  @xcite did not have any scope of the formation of jets , in the early 80 s , accretion solutions of purely rotating disk",
    "were improved to include the effect of radiation pressure  @xcite ( see chakrabarti  @xcite for a review . ) and see if these thick disks were useful for the production and collimation of jets .",
    "jet solutions have changed from speculative ideas such as de - laval nozzles  @xcite to electrodynamically acceleration model  @xcite , self - similar centrifugally driven outflows  @xcite , ` cauldrons '  @xcite etc .",
    "centrifugally driven outflows are subsequently modified to include accretion disks  @xcite .",
    "chakrabarti & bhaskaran  @xcite ( see also , contopoulos  @xcite ) showed that it is easier produce outflows from a sub - keplerian inflow .",
    "it is important to note that in black hole accretion , matter is relativistic close to the black hole horizon , while in jets , matter become relativistic farther away from the the black hole . in both the cases , matter is assumed to begin its journey subsonically and end its journey supersonically .",
    "bondi  @xcite studied simplest form of accretion and wind solutions with these properties for spherically symmetric flows without any heating and cooling .",
    "especially important are the outflow solutions which were immediately used to study solar and stellar winds  @xcite . in the context of active galaxies and quasars , some notional unification of disk - like and jet - like solutions",
    "were presented by chakrabarti  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the same solution of purely rotating flow around a black hole could describe accretion flows on the equatorial plane and pre - jet matters near the axis . with a natural angular momentum distribution of @xmath0 , ( where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants and @xmath3 is the von zeipel parameter ) it was found that for large @xmath1 and small @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) , solutions are regular on the equatorial plane and they describe thick accretion disks . however , for small @xmath1 and large @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) , the solutions are regular on the polar axis and they describe pre - jet matter .",
    "it was conjectured that that some viscous process might be responsible to change the pair of parameters ( @xmath6 ) from one set to the other .",
    "eggum , coroniti & katz  @xcite considered radiatively driven outflows emerging from a keplerian disk .",
    "the angular momentum distribution in the outflow qualitatively looks similar to the natural distribution described above .",
    "chakrabarti  @xcite used the natural distribution to study acceleration of the pre - jet matter inside the funnel of a thick disk and found that jets could be accelerated at the cost of thermal and rotational energies close to a black hole .",
    "addition of magnetic field in the wind solution enhances the terminal velocity substantially  @xcite .",

    "winds and outflows are profuse from this region .",
    "this is schematically shown in the right panel of the figure .",
    "on the equatorial plane of the disk , viscosity may be high and the disk remains keplerian .",
    "subsequently , it becomes sub - keplerian before entering the black hole .",
    "however , the sub - keplerian flow above and below the equatorial plane could be heated up in the corona region by magnetic dissipation . when its energy become positive ( unbound ) , it becomes energetically favorable to produce shocks and outflows .",
    "solutions in sa and sw are in general steady ( with shocks in accretion and winds respectively ) , except when cooling processes are added and cooling time scales roughly agree with the infall time scale .",
    "molteni , sponholz and chakrabarti  @xcite produced examples of this types of shocks .",
    "shocks are found to perform large amplitude oscillation with a periodicity of @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the mean location of the shock in dimensionless units , @xmath13 is the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole , @xmath14 is the compression ratio of the shock , @xmath15 in the post - shock region .",
    "inverse of these time scales agree very well with the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) of hard x - rays and are believed to be the cause of qpos in black hole and neutron star candidates . since cooling time scale generally goes down as accretion rate is increased , oscillation frequency should go up with accretion rate .",
    "solutions from the regions nsa and nsw have two saddle type sonic points as in solutions of sa and sw regions .",
    "however , rankine - hugoniot conditions are not satisfied and therefore steady shocks do not form .",
    "it was shown that solutions from these regions still possess shocks , but they are oscillatory , constantly trying to search for the steady location  @xcite .",
    "these shock oscillations also have similar time scales as above , but the oscillation frequency is directly sensitive to the angular momentum and specific energy of the flow and not the accretion rate . detailed simulation with radiative transfer is essential to understand these oscillations .",
    "although hydrodynamic processes alone are not thought to be the sole mechanisms in generation and acceleration of cosmic jets and outflows , a great deal of the behavior of jets could be learned about the jets from hydrodynamic considerations .",
    "chakrabarti  @xcite computed the rate of outflow generation assuming the outflow to be isothermal at least upto the sonic point .",
    "it was found that the ratio of the inflow and outflow rates @xmath16 could be expressed in terms of just three parameters : ( a ) @xmath14 , the compression ratio of the flow at the accretion shock , ( b ) @xmath17 , the solid angle subtended by the accretion flow at the centre and ( c ) , @xmath18 , the solid angle subtended by the outflow at the centre .",
    "the result  @xcite is given by : @xmath19^{3/2 } exp   ( \\frac{3}{2 } - \\frac{r^2}{r-1 } ) .",

    "shocks are weakened as the post - shock region is cooled down completely  @xcite . as the compression ratio approaches unity , the outflow rate also goes to zero . in the hard state ,",
    "as the compression ratio approaches @xmath21 , @xmath22 , i.e. , roughly ten percent of infalling matter goes out of the system .",
    "details about the relation between the spectral states and the outflows would be dealt with elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "chakrabarti & titarchuk  @xcite showed that post - shock region behaves as the so - called compton cloud in determining the spectral states of black hole .",
    "in general , when the soft photons ( generated by the keplerian matter ) intercepted by the cenbol is very large , this region is cooled down and the black hole is seen in a soft state . however , when soft - photons are very few , cenbol remains hot and the black hole spectrum shows characteristics of a hard state .",
    "thus state change is equivalent to redistribution of matter into the keplerian ( producer of soft photons in the pre - shock flow , and hot electrons in the post - shock region ) and the sub - keplerian components ( producers of hot electrons ) in this model .",

    "when the rate of wind production is very high , the region up to the sonic surface of the wind could be cooled down by comptonization process .",
    "since the sound speed in this region is suddenly reduced , the sonic surface of the wind is shifted downward , and a part of the wind , originally sub - sonic , becomes supersonic and is separated out as a blob , while the rest below the new sonic surface returns back to the accretion disk ( fig .",
    "this causes enhanced accretion for a brief period and count rates go up  @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the cause of non - linearity in the light curve @xmath24(t ) .",

    "cenbol may emit bremsstrahlung or comptonized soft photons . however , @xmath29 the soft photon intensity intercepted from the keplerian disk depends on cenbol parameters themselves . as molteni ,",
    "sponholz and chakrabarti  @xcite showed cenbol undergoes oscillations and intercepts photons of varying degree .",
    "the net outflow is @xmath30 which is also time - dependent .",
    "the net inflow onto the black hole is @xmath31 .",
    "since the return flow increases electron density in the cenbol temporarily , the spectrum is hardened in the high - count states or on states . as this excess matter",
    "is drained into the black hole , the light curves shows a low - count or off state .",
    "the whole process can repeat again and again , though because of details of non - linear feedback from the wind results need not be strictly periodic .",
    "this is thought to produce a very interesting behavior in the light curve of at least one black hole candidate : grs1915 + 105 .",
    "if the accretion rate is not too high , the wind rate will be low for most of shock parameters , and such periodic cooling would not occur .",
    "this may be the reason , why other black holes which are known to have lower rates , do not exhibit as exotic light curve as grs1915 + 105 .",
    "we thus notice that the spectrum in otherwise harder states are softened and softer states are hardened due to the presence of the wind and the return flows respectively .",
    "one bye - product of this is that the intersection point or the pivotal point of the two spectra ( of on and off states ) recedes to a much higher energy .",
    "this is precisely what is observed in the superluminal source grs1915 + 105 .",

    "scales go up proportionately and hence switching of spectral states or variabilities could not be studied as simply as in galactic black holes .",

    "multiwavelength correlation in outflows of grs1915 + 105  @xcite suggest that the same region which produces comptonising photons also produce jets .",
