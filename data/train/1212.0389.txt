    "in many applications , one needs to find out the flaws in materials nondestructively . inspired by this",
    ", the non - destructive evaluation technique has attracted the eyes of many researchers during the last decade .",
    "as one kind of non - destructive evaluation technique , eddy current testing technique @xcite has been used for flaw detection . in this paper , we intend to design an algorithm to identify the crack or inhomogeneities in the nonlinear magnetic material like steel from the local measurements of the magnetic induction .",
    "this inverse problem is a problem of shape reconstruction .",
    "similar to general shape recovery problem , there is no information about the interface of the optimal shape as a prior , so we need to have a good mechanism to express the shape and track the evolution of the shape .",
    "the level set method was first originally proposed by osher and sethian in @xcite . for this method ,",
    "the interface between two adjacent domains is represented by the zero level set of a lipschitz continuous function . through the change of this function",
    ", this method can easily handle many types of shape and topological changes , such as merging , splitting and developing sharp corners . due to these merits",
    ", it has been used in various areas , such as epitaxial growth @xcite , inverse problem , optimal design @xcite , image segmentation @xcite , structure topology optimization @xcite and eit problem @xcite . for the sake of the numerical stability ,",
    "the level set function is usually chosen as the signed distance function , but at most cases , the level set function after each iteration is not be a signed distance function and is usually re - initialized by solving an ordinary differential equation @xcite . in @xcite , cimrk et al . used the level set method to represent the shape of the inhomogeneity and evolve the shape by minimizing a functional during the iterative process . in @xcite ,",
    "cimrk also used the level set method for the representation of the interface to solve some inverse problems in thermal imaging and the nonlinear ferromagnetic material .",
    "as to the initial value of the level set function , it was reported in @xcite that the level set method based only on the shape sensitivity may get stuck at shapes with fewer holes than the optimal geometry in some applications such as structure designs .",
    "when one wants to use the level set method to solve the practical problem , he can reduce the effects of the initial value of the level set function on the final results in the next two ways .",
    "the first way is to choose the shape with enough holes as the initial value .",
    "the second one is to introduce the topological derivative into the level set method to let the shape create holes in the iterations @xcite . to find a good initial value of the level set function , the researchers in @xcite proposed the gradient - for - initial approach which is based on the idea that the domain which can drop the value of the cost functional should be the air gap . in that approach",
    ", the parameter in smeared - out heaviside function should be set large enough .",
    "the large value of this parameter , however , may cause the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "so the parameter in the acquisition of the initial choice of the level set function and the evolving process of level set function should be set separately .",
    "recently , piecewise constant level set method , which is a variant of level set method , was proposed by lie , lysaker and tai in @xcite . to distinguish these two methods , we call the former one traditional level set method . unlike the traditional level set method",
    ", the interface between two adjacent sub - domains is represented by the discontinuity of a piecewise constant level set function . compared with traditional level set method , piecewise constant level set method",
    "has at least two advantages .",
    "one merit is that it can create many small holes automatically without the topological derivatives during the iterative process .",
    "furthermore , it is verified by many numerical examples that the final result is independent of the initial value of the level set function in many numerical tests .",
    "and the other one is that the piecewise constant level set method need not to re - initialize the level set function periodically during the evolution process , thus , reduces the computational cost a lot .",
    "since it was proposed , it has been applied in various fields such as image segmentation , elliptic inverse coefficient identification , optimal shape design , electrical impedance tomography and positron emission tomography @xcite .",
    "lie , lysaker and tai took this method to solve the image segmentation in @xcite and the elliptic inverse problem and interface motion problem in @xcite .",
    "wei and wang used piecewise constant level set method to solve structural topology optimization in @xcite .",
    "zhu , liu and wu applied the piecewise constant level set method to solve a class of two - phase shape optimization problems in @xcite .",
    "zhang and cheng proposed a boundary piecewise constant level set method to deal with the boundary control of eigenvalue optimization problems in @xcite . in this paper , we intend to use the piecewise constant level set method to represent the shape and recover the exact shape of the crack or the inhomogeneities of nonlinear magnetic material .",
    "based on the piecewise constant level set method , we propose a piecewise constant level set algorithm to recover the shape of the nonlinear magnetic material problem .",
    "we introduce the piecewise constant level set method and convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by the lagrangian multiplier method . in the numerical tests ,",
    "our algorithm relies little on the initial guess of the level set function .",
    "moreover , our algorithm can reconstruct shape accurately even when the noise level is high .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the piecewise constant level method in brief . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce the direct problem and the inverse problem . in section 4",
    ", we describe the deduction of the first variation w.r.t level set function for the objective functional in the unconstrained optimization problem in detail . in section 5 ,",

    "the values of @xmath5 at four corners first become smaller then start to increase to 2 . in fig .",
    "[ example_3_without_regu ] , the values of @xmath5 at four points of @xmath0 are 1 .",
    "thus we can conclude that it is the effects of the regularization term to pull the values of @xmath5 at these points to 2 .     without regularization.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]",
    "+    compared with the algorithm in @xcite , pclsa takes much less steps , but reconstructs a more accurate shape . in @xcite",
    ", it takes 574 iteration steps to stop the algorithm . in our pclsa",
    ", we only need half of that iterations , that is , totally 307 iterations to stop the algorithm .",
    "moreover , with more iterations in @xcite the final reconstruction shape still deviates a lot from the exact shape . in our final result ( see fig [ example3:subfig ] ) , however , there is no deviations at all .",
    "thus pclsa performs better than the algorithm in @xcite for this example .    in order to show the flexibility of the initial guess of @xmath5",
    ", we assign different values to @xmath119 and compare the final results .",
    "we set @xmath119 to be different constants , that is , 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.7 , 1.9 , respectively , and present the final results in fig .",
    "[ flexi_ini : subfig ] . for these four different values of @xmath119 ,",
    "the interfaces represented by @xmath5 and @xmath66 coincide and the number of the points where @xmath5 and @xmath66 take different value is 0 .",
    "this indicates that our algorithm can identify the shape exactly .",
    "furthermore , we choose a more general function as the initial value of @xmath5 and also observe the final interface .",
    "the general function is @xmath171 where @xmath172 can produce pseudo - random values between 0 and 1 .",
    "we present the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ flexi_rand : subfig ] , where the interfaces represented by @xmath5 and @xmath66 coincide .    from the above observation",
    ", pclsa relies little on the initial value of the level set function .",
    "thus , we need not to put too much attentions on the initial guess of @xmath5 in our pclsa for the nonlinear electromagnetism recovery problems .",
    "[ example4 ] to test the robustness of pclsa , we use the measurement data of @xmath64 with a certain level of noise . for this test",
    ", we use the same case in example 2 except that the measurement data of @xmath64 is polluted by the certain level of noise , 5% , 10%,15% and 20% .    in this test , @xmath173 .",
    "we set @xmath170 , the upper bound of @xmath129 to be 10 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 . for different noise level cases ,",
    "the final results are shown in fig .",
    "[ example4:subfig ] .",
    "when the noise level is under 15% , the pclsa reconstructs the shape of @xmath32 completely .",
    "that is , in our numerical test , the two functions @xmath5 and @xmath66 take the same value at every point @xmath145 .",
    "but when the noise level is up to 20% , though the interface between the steel and air represented by @xmath5 is recovered , there are some flaws at the interface between @xmath32 and @xmath176 ( some blue points ) . for the range of @xmath177 , the interval @xmath178 is shown by our numerical tests to be not a bad choice .",
    "however , @xmath177 affects the iteration steps in our pclsa .",
    "the larger @xmath177 is , the less steps the algorithm takes .",
    "but at high noise level , the reconstructed shape is better when the value of @xmath177 is smaller .",
    "in this paper , we propose a piecewise constant level set algorithm for the nonlinear electromagnetism inverse problem . in our numeric test ,",
    "our pclsa do not rely on the initial guess of the level set function @xmath5 , and can reconstruct the shape of @xmath0 exactly even when the noise level is high .",
    "our pcsla is quite effective and robust to solve a kind of nonlinear inverse problems .",
