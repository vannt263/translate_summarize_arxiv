    "the study of the fully coherent propagation of light in the quantum domain , where the non - classical response of a resonant medium is taken into account , was opened by the famous work of mccall and hahn @xcite .",
    "they used low - temperature ruby and nanosecond - scale pulses , and reported experimental realization of the first optical solitons , in agreement with their novel theory of self - induced transparency ( sit ) .",
    "mccall and hahn supplied the theoretical foundation for the sit effect by self - consistently combining a two - level model for the interacting cr@xmath1 impurity ions with a semiclassical treatment of the field @xcite .",
    "the understanding of coherent optical pulse propagation in two - level resonant media was rapidly extended @xcite .",
    "our interest here is in coherent two - pulse propagation ( for an early example , see @xcite ) .",
    "many different parameters of both the medium and the pulses themselves can play physically distinct roles during propagation .",
    "we adopt common restrictions made in treating lambda - type media in order to provide a close focus on a few interesting questions .",
    "for example , we assume that the rotating wave approximation is reliable and that the detunings of the two pulses are large and are also equal , so that two - photon resonance applies .    to focus attention on coherent evolution we also assume that the pulse durations are short enough to ignore homogeneous relaxation of the atoms , but we allow inhomogeneous broadening . to restrict the range of atomic effects we assume that the pulse is too weak to cause excitation beyond the three lambda levels , that the  total \" pulse area is of order @xmath2 , and that the propagation path is long enough to allow asymptotic conditions of propagation to be reached .",
    "a standard sketch is shown in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] . because of our focus on fully coherent propagation",
    "there are natural connections to sit , and because our medium is of lambda type , some connections are expected with harris s electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite and traditional stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) @xcite and fully coherent  transient \" srs @xcite , all of which usually employ a quasi-_cw _ or undepleted pump field instead of a short pump pulse .",
    "we first present a class of analytic solutions to our two - pulse nonlinear evolution equations ( three - level maxwell - bloch equations ) .",
    "the solutions support our earlier observation @xcite that in the situations of interest one can divide the evolution process into three widely separated propagation zones : a strong interaction or  pulse transfer \" zone , and the zones in the distant past and distant future of the transfer zone .",
    "the analytic solutions are analogs of previously known resonant srs solitons presented by bolshov , et al . @xcite and our use of the park - shin bcklund solution approach @xcite allows incorporation of far off - resonant pulses and a medium with either pure or quantum - mixed ground states .",
    "we find that our solutions are constrained by a new two - pulse area condition similar to the @xmath2 area condition in sit .",
    "the analytic solutions are then used in several ways .",
    "we have found in numerical modeling that the solution formula and the new two - pulse area condition serve as accurate predictors of output pulse shape and total area , even for a variety of input conditions not conforming to the analytic solutions .",
    "this is closely reminiscent of the behavior of coherent short pulses in one - photon resonant two - level media , which evolve coherently toward the @xmath2 @xmath3 pulse of sit , even if injected into a medium with shape and area not in that form .",
    "we also make use of the analytic solution formulas to check departures from adiabatic predictions .",
    "an adiabatic restriction is normal in time - dependent treatments of eit effects , and we are interested in its limits of applicability in the context of propagation .",
    "similar questions can be asked about srs , commonly treated as an adiabatic propagation process governed by approximate far off - resonant conditions , where a large product of detuning and pulse duration , @xmath4 , is used to justify an approximate two - level set of evolution equations .",
    "we solve numerically for the evolution behavior in the large - detuning case , and demonstrate the inadequacy of the reduced - equation approach if either pulse has near - unit area .    in some early numerical work with two - pulse evolution in three - level media @xcite ,",
    "a striking and unexplained pulse breakup was reported for solutions of the reduced two - level equations .",
    "our results , obtained in a similar physical situation but with the more fundamental three - level equations , suggest a resolution of this effect , as pulse breakup related to higher order sit - type multi - pulse formation .",
    "finally , the analytic solutions permit a new kind of comment on two - pulse propagation in lambda media .",
    "we use them , along with numerical solutions , to show a strong contrast with the earlier reports by kozlov and eberly @xcite of relative pulse stability of eit - type and sit - type propagation behavior .",
    "we show here that the presence or absence of quantum coherence of the ground - level preparation of the medium is the crucial property in determining asymptotic stability , and we conclude that mixed - state preparation leads to sit - type stability , opposite to the conclusion reached for pure - state preparation .",
    "we consider dual - pulse propagation in a medium of three - level atoms in the lambda configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] . given linear polarization ,",
    "the electric fields of the individual laser pulses can be written as scalars : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the slowly varying envelope of the electric field , @xmath7 is the wavenumber , and @xmath8 is the frequency , with a similar formulation for the second pulse @xmath9 . for the 1 - 3 transition we have the rabi frequency @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the interacting component of the transition dipole moment , and the detuning is @xmath12 .",
    "we use corresponding notation for the 2 - 3 transition .",
    "note that the same @xmath13 serves as the one - photon detuning of each transition below resonance , which implies exact two - photon resonance .     ]    the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating wave picture is given by @xmath14 where the factorization in the last line suggests introducing the  bright \" and  dark \" state representations of the two lower states @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 clearly depend only on @xmath18 , while the orthognal  dark \" state @xmath19 @xcite does not participate in the temporal dynamics .",
    "dynamical evolution is confined to @xmath18 and @xmath20 only so long as spatial evolution is ignored .",
    "when spatial evolution is permitted , and the dark state is a participant , it can be difficult to maintain some of the restrictions that are commonly imposed in treating two - field physics ( fixed control field intensity , a permanently weak probe field , etc . ) .",
    "some effects of dark - state participation in propagation have been pointed out previously ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , and kozlov and eberly more recently showed that the dark state even completely controls evolution asymptotically @xcite when propagation occurs in a lambda medium of two coherently prepared ground states ( sometimes called  phaseonium \" @xcite ) .",
    "the contrast extends to stimulated raman scattering , historically the first lambda - medium propagation effect , and not associated with an extended prepared coherence between the two ground levels .",
    "we now derive analytically exact two - pulse solutions for lambda media .",
    "this requires an extension of previous soliton theories for resonant srs propagation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we depart substantially from resonance , however still near enough that we can neglect anti - stokes effects or interaction with any other excited states .",
    "we adopt srs nomenclature and will refer to @xmath21 as the pump field and @xmath22 as the stokes field .",
    "we will focus on non - phaseonium medium preparation , but include a variety of mixed - state descriptions of levels 1 and 2 .",
    "this permits us to account for incoherent initial population distributions that may arise from thermal effects , incoherent optical pumping of the ground states , etc .",
    "the solution method we use allows for significant changes in both the pump and stokes pulses , and gives analytical insight into previously pursued numerical studies of short - pulse raman propagation @xcite .",

    "the equations for the density matrix elements are :    [ rhoequations ] @xmath26    without damping terms , eqs . and imply that the duration of the laser pulses under consideration is much shorter than all homogeneous relaxation processes ( such as the excited state decay , with rate @xmath27 , shown in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] ) , thus justifying their neglect .    for simplicity we will change to a travelling reference frame",
    "where the time derivatives are with respect to the retarded time @xmath28 and the spatial derivatives are with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "this specification gives @xmath30    the field evolves according to maxwell s equations . in effect , the interaction hamiltonian itself , which is just the dipole interaction @xmath31 , evolves according to maxwell s equations .",
    "we assume that the pump field only interacts with the @xmath32 transition , the stokes field only interacts with the @xmath33 transition , and the fields move only in the positive @xmath34 direction .",
    "these assumptions are justified by the inequality @xmath35 together with the slowly varying envelope approximation , and they give two distinct field equations from maxwell s equations :    [ maxwellequation ] @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the density of atoms , @xmath38 is the atom field coupling parameter for the @xmath39 transition , and similarly @xmath40 for transition @xmath41 .",
    "for simplicity in the derivations to be presented , we have not included inhomogeneous broadening in these equations , but it will be incorporated in the end .",
    "we note that when @xmath42 these results can be combined into a single matrix equation for the spatial evolution of the hamiltonian : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and this matrix format will be useful shortly . for notational simplicity",
    "we have suppressed the functional dependences of the density matrix elements in eq .",

    "it is highly useful to have solutions both in analytic form and without adiabatic assumptions .",
    "the inverse scattering technique has previously been used to construct resonant solutions @xcite .",
    "these equations are integrable when @xmath48 , which we will assume from now on .",
    "we will solve these equations using the park - shin ( ps ) formulation @xcite of the bcklund solution method .",
    "we will briefly sketch the ps method , and slightly generalize their approach to include arbitrary detuning of fields .",
    "one begins by finding a pair of linear operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which will allow for a linear representation of the nonlinear maxwell - bloch equations when subject to the constraint that @xmath51=0 $ ] .",
    "we define these operators as :    [ l ] @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the spectral parameter , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the hamiltonian in eq . with @xmath59 . to recover the maxwell - bloch equations one imposes the commutator relation @xmath51 = 0 $ ] and then compares terms with like orders of @xmath53 . in doing",
    "so one finds the two independent @xmath60 matrix equations    @xmath61 \\label{schr - uv } \\\\",

    "is simply the von neumann equation , and it is straightforward to show that eq . is equivalent to the matrix form of maxwell s equation presented in eq . .",

    "the ps method now proceeds as follows .",
    "because @xmath49 and @xmath50 commute , they have common eigenvectors , which we represent here in the form of matrix @xmath65 :    [ l_m ] @xmath66    we now apply the bcklund transformation to eqns . by writing the solution matrix @xmath65 in terms of a known  proto - solution \" matrix , which we denote as @xmath67 , and a dressing operator @xmath68 .",
    "the proto - solution can even be a trivial solution .",

    "we now insert the definition of @xmath69 into eqns .",
    ", and compare terms with like orders of @xmath53 , which results in four independent equations .",
    "this allows one to eliminate equations involving the space and time derivatives to arrive at the following two equations :    [ uv - sol ] @xmath79 \\label{solfield } \\\\ v & = \\frac{\\eta^2}{\\eta^2 +   \\delta^2}\\left(2p-1-i\\frac{\\delta}{\\eta}\\right)v^{(0)}\\left(2p-1+i\\frac{\\delta}{\\eta}\\right )   \\label{solrho}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eqns .",

    "can be exponentiated together to give @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an arbitrary constant vector , with coefficients @xmath84 , which is specified by the initial condition of the pulse .",

    "the input pump pulse is identical in form to an sit pulse and is coupled to the @xmath32 absorbing transition .",
    "it causes coherent atom excitation , and travels with reduced group velocity @xmath140 .",
    "meanwhile the output stokes pulse , while similar in temporal shape to an sit pulse is completely decoupled from the medium , and thus moves with group velocity @xmath141 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have neglected any anti - stokes interaction , and have limited our atomic system to three levels .",
    "this is a trivial example of a dark state where lack of population in state 2 , rather than quantum interference effects , causes the medium to be transparent to the stokes pulse .",

    "what is found by comparison beyond lowest order is that the traditional two - level srs theory does not consistently predict the short - pulse raman transfer process developed in the preceding section .",

    "it appears that the pulse durations and strengths were used in combinations to make pulse areas greater than permitted for validity of the two - level equations . in particular",
