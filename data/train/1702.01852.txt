    "the ion trap system consists of five @xmath3yb@xmath4 ions which are confined in a linear paul trap and laser - cooled close to their motional ground state ( see fig.[fig : fig1](b ) ) @xcite .",
    "the qubits are magnetic field - insensitive pairs of states in the hyperfine - split @xmath5 ground - level of each atom , which gives a qubit frequency of @xmath6 .",
    "all control and measurement is performed optically .",
    "state preparation and readout are accomplished by optical pumping and state - dependent fluorescence detection @xcite .",
    "qubit operations are realized via pairs of raman beams , derived from a single @xmath7 nm mode - locked laser .",
    "these optical controllers consist of an array of individual addressing beams and a counter - propagating global beam that illuminates the entire chain @xcite .",
    "single - qubit rotations are driven by a raman beat - note of defined amplitude , phase , and duration resonant with the qubit frequency .",
    "two - qubit operations are produced by applying raman beams to a pair of ions , with beat - note frequencies near the motional sidebands .",
    "this creates an effective xx - ising interaction between the spins mediated by all modes of motion @xcite .",
    "we use a pulse - shaping scheme to ensure spin and motion are disentangled at the end of the operation @xcite .",
    "since all ions partake in the collective motion of the chain , gates between any pair can be invoked in this way ( see inset of fig.[fig : fig1](b ) ) .",
    "the addressing during operations and the distinction between qubits during readout are both achieved by spatially resolving the ions .",
    "the fidelities for single- and two - qubit gates are typically @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the single - qubit readout fidelity is @xmath10 for state @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for state @xmath13 .",
    "the latter is lower since off - resonant excitation during readout predominantly causes @xmath14 pumping .",
    "the average readout fidelity for an entire @xmath2-qubit state is @xmath15 .",
    "this is lower than one would expect from the average single - qubit readout fidelity , since there is crosstalk that leads to @xmath16 errors on adjacent channels .",
    "typical gate times are @xmath17s for single- and @xmath18s for two - qubit gates .",
    "spin depolarization is negligible for hyperfine ground level qubits ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the spin - dephasing time ( @xmath20 ) is @xmath21s in the current setup , and can be easily extended by suppressing magnetic field noise .    , where all cnots are present .",
    "the hidden shift diagram represents the shift pattern @xmath22 , where x - operations are present on qubits @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . ]    in analogy to atoms given by nature , the man - made superconducting circuits in the ibm quantum computer can be thought of as `` artificial atoms '' @xcite .",
    "they are transmon qubits @xcite , or superconducting islands connected by josephson junctions and shunt capacitors that provide superpositions of charge states which are insensitive to charge fluctuations .",
    "the device used here has a range of qubit frequencies between @xmath2 and @xmath26ghz @xcite .",
    "the qubits are connected to each other and the classical control system by microwave resonators .",
    "state preparation @xcite and readout , as well as single- @xcite and two - qubit gates @xcite , are achieved by applying tailored microwave signals to this network and measuring the response .",
    "qubits are resolved in the frequency domain during addressing and readout . in the quantum experience hardware ,",
    "the qubits are connected in a star - shaped pattern that provides four two - qubit interactions ( see inset fig.[fig : fig1](a ) ) , which are cnot gates targeting the central qubit .",
    "single - qubit readout fidelities are typically @xmath27 @xcite , and the average readout fidelity for an arbitrary @xmath2-qubit state is @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "typical gate fidelities are @xmath29 and @xmath30 for single- and two - qubit gates , respectively .",
    "typical gate times are @xmath31ns for single- and @xmath32ns for two - qubit gates , while coherence times are @xmath33s for both depolarization ( @xmath34 ) and spin dephasing ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the publicly accessible system runs autonomously , not requiring any human intervention over many weeks @xcite .",
    "this level of reliability may come at a cost due to drifts between periodic calibrations .",
    "higher connectivity can in general be achieved by coupling @xmath24-@xmath25 transmons to one resonator , limited by spectral resolution .",
    "the present layout could be modified to provide connections from qubit @xmath23 to @xmath2 , and @xmath36 to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other superconducting architectures involving multi - mode resonators @xcite can offer higher connectivity .    on these two machines ,",
    "we compare a selection of composite gates and algorithms that represent a variety of circuit connectivities . in each case , we map the algorithms to the device by breaking them down into circuits made up of gates native to the specific hardware .",
    "we rely on an optimization protocol @xcite to accomplish this task for the trapped ions , and cnot@xmath37t / z@xmath38 algebra @xcite with further manual optimization to compose the experiments for the ibm machine .",
    "the available gate set for the ion trap system consists of the two - qubit xx gate , as well as arbitrary single - qubit r@xmath39 gate rotations by an angle @xmath40 about any axis ( given by @xmath41 ) on the equator of the bloch sphere .",
    "we call this the r / xx library .",
    "the ibm system makes available the family of gates ( x , y , z , h , s , cnot and t @xcite ) , known as the clifford@xmath37 t library .",
    "since each gate is subject to errors , the circuits are optimized to minimize the number of operations used .",
    "the resulting gate numbers are optimal for two - qubit gates , and either optimal or close to optimal for single - qubit gates .",
    "the total number of single- and two - qubit gates for each algorithm is shown in table [ tb : gatecount ] .",
    "the r / xx library offers a better overall expressive power .",
    "however , we note that the clifford@xmath42 library was likely chosen for didactic reasons and is not native to superconducting systems , which do in principle offer continuous parameters for single- and two - qubit gates .    .single- and two - qubit gate counts for the circuits on the superconducting ( star - shaped ) and the ion trap ( fully connected ) system after mapping to the respective hardware using the respective gate libraries . for comparison ,",
    "the gate counts for a linear nearest - neighbor ( lnn ) architecture as implemented in @xcite are included .",
    "we also note the gate count for the quantum fourier transfrom ( qft ) for @xmath24 and @xmath2 qubits .",
    "the latter was implemented in @xcite using a sequence of modular gates that was not optimized for gate count .",
    "the qft-5 can not be implemented exactly using the current ibm gate library .",

    "<S> we run a selection of algorithms on two state - of - the - art 5-qubit quantum computers that are based on different technology platforms . </S>",
    "<S> one is a publicly accessible superconducting transmon device @xcite with limited connectivity , and the other is a fully connected trapped - ion system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though the two systems have different native quantum interactions , both can be programmed in a way that is blind to the underlying hardware , thus allowing the first comparison of identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that quantum algorithms and circuits that employ more connectivity clearly benefit from a better connected system of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> while the quantum systems here are not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers , this experiment exposes critical factors of scaling quantum computers , such as qubit connectivity and gate expressivity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the results suggest that co - designing particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in successfully using quantum computers in the future .    inspired by the vast computing power a universal quantum computer could offer , several candidate systems are being explored . </S>",
    "<S> they have allowed experimental demonstrations of quantum gates , operations , and algorithms of ever increasing sophistication . </S>",
    "<S> recently , two architectures , superconducting transmon qubits @xcite and trapped ions @xcite , have reached a new level of maturity . </S>",
    "<S> they have become fully programmable multi - qubit machines that provide the user with the flexibility to implement arbitrary quantum circuits from a high - level interface . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible for the first time to test quantum computers irrespective of their particular physical implementation .    </S>",
    "<S> while the quantum computers considered here are still small scale and their capabilities do not currently reach beyond small demonstration algorithms , this line of inquiry can still provide useful insights into the performance of existing systems and the role of architecture in quantum computer design . </S>",
    "<S> these will be crucial for the realization of more advanced future incarnations of the present technologies .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard abstract model of quantum computation assumes that interactions between arbitrary pairs of qubits are available . </S>",
    "<S> however , physical architectures will in general have certain constraints on qubit connectivity , such as nearest - neighbor couplings only . </S>",
    "<S> these restrictions do not in principle limit the ability to perform arbitrary computations , since swap operations may be used to effect gates between arbitrary qubits using the connections available . for a general circuit , reducing a fully - connected system to the more sparse star - shaped or linear nearest - neighbor connectivity requires an increase in the number of gates of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how much overhead is incurred in practice depends on the connections used in a particular circuit and how efficiently they can be matched to the physical qubit - to - qubit interaction graph .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we make use of the public access recently granted by ibm to a @xmath2-qubit superconducting device ( illustrated in fig.[fig : fig1](a ) ) via their `` quantum experience '' cloud service @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to repeat algorithms that we perform in our own ion trap experiment on an independent quantum computer of identical size and comparable capability but with a different physical implementation at its core . </S>"
