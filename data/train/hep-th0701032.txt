    "the appearance of non  local operators in the relativistic extensions of the schrdinger equation poses a serious challenge both to analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "however , the inclusion of relativistic effects is crucial for example in the study of meson phenomenology , where the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) provides the correct theoretical tool to describe relativistic bound states . replacing the kernel in the bse with an instantaneous local potential one obtains a relativistic schrdinger equation , which is also known as `` spinless salpeter equation '' ( sse ) . in such case",
    "the hamiltonian operator is typically given by = + v ( )  .",
    "[ eq1 ]    from a technical point of view , the inclusion in the hamiltonian of the relativistic kinetic energy operator , @xmath0 , complicates the solution of the problem because of its non  local nature .",
    "the great phenomenological relevance of the sse has motivated in the past twenty years many efforts to solve this equation , either using analytical or numerical techniques . early work on this subject is contained for example in @xcite . the method described in @xcite , which allows one to obtain",
    "a matrix representation of the non - local kinetic energy operator , has also been used recently @xcite in conjunction with the lagrange mesh method . in this case",
    ", the method is particularly appealing since it does not require the evaluation of the matrix elements of the potential , but rather only the specification of the potential on the grid points .",
    "this feature is also shared by the so called sinc collocation methods ( see for example @xcite ) , which could also be used straightforwardly together with the method of @xcite : however we do not consider this possibility since we are rather interested in developing a completely new approach , as it will soon become clear .    in a series of recent works , lucha and",
    "collaborators have been able to obtain precise upper and lower bounds to the eigenvalues of the rse , @xcite : these bounds provide useful analytic or semi  analytic expressions and have been applied to a number of test problems ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "another approach has been followed in @xcite , where an effective hamiltonian of non - relativistic form , which includes relativistic effects by means of parameters depending on the momentum , was constructed .",
    "finally , the sse was also studied in the case of the relativistic harmonic oscillator ( rho ) in three recent papers , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors were able to obtain recurrence relations for the coefficients of the series defining the eigenfunctions .",
    "the reader can also find useful the detailed bibliographic information contained in that paper .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to develop a completely new approach to the solution of the sse : we will derive an _ analytical _ representation of the non  local kinetic energy operator and use it with the variational sinc collocation method ( vscm )  @xcite to obtain arbitrarily precise numerical results .",
    "we will use the rho of @xcite , for which semi  analytical results are available , to test our approach . the new representation that we have found for the relativistic kinetic energy operator has also been generalized to the calculation of the quantum mechanical green s function and has allowed us to obtain a new formula , which differs from the standard formula of path integrals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we describe the sse for the rho and obtain precise numerical solutions working in momentum space configuration ( these results are then compared with the results of @xcite ) ; in section [ sec2 ] we obtain an explicit analytical expression for the matrix elements of the non  local kinetic energy operator in terms of the so called `` little sinc functions '' ( lsf ) recently studied in @xcite ( these functions were first introduced by schwartz in @xcite and later used by baye in @xcite ) ; we use this representation in the vscm working in coordinate space and reproduce the results previously obtained in momentum space ; in section [ sec3 ] we extend our method to obtain explicit analytical representation for the green s function which holds for general potentials ; finally in section [ sec4 ] we draw our conclusions and set the direction for future work .",
    "the rho problem corresponds to the case in which a spherical harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath1 , is used in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . after a simple rescaling of the mass and of the energy the schrdinger equation can be cast in the form |=  |  , depending on a single parameter @xmath2  .",
    "the advantage of considering this potential lies in the fact that the corresponding schrdinger equation in momentum space representation is local and it can therefore be attacked with standard techniques . in this case",
    "we are left with the equation ( p ) =  ( p )  , where @xmath3 .",
    "the authors of @xcite focus their analysis on the @xmath4 solutions and obtain a recurrence relation for the coefficients of the reduced radial wave function @xmath5 .",
    "the same problem has also been discussed by m. trott in @xcite , using a basis of harmonic oscillator wave functions in momentum space and numerically computing in this basis the matrix element @xmath6 .",
    "we will use the vscm of @xcite to obtain a numerical solution of the problem and then compare our solution with the results of @xcite .",
    "the vscm uses sinc functions ( sf ) , defined on the real line , or `` little sinc functions '' ( lsf)@xcite , a particular generalization of sinc functions defined on finite intervals , to solve the schrdinger equation by a collocation technique . since the details of this method",
    "are clearly explained in @xcite , we will here avoid mentioning all the technical details focusing on giving a more qualitative picture .    sf and lsf are functions which are strongly peaked around a certain value and they fastly decay and oscillate , when moving away from this value .",
    "under certain conditions they can be chosen to be orthogonal : such set of orthogonal functions is obtained by performing a replica of one function at the points where this function vanishes , thus effectively introducing a grid . unless otherwise specified , either by the physics of the problem or by convention , the spacing of the grid is _ arbitrary _ and , if not carefully chosen , it strongly affects the precision of the results .",
    "in a recent paper amore et al . have used an arbitrary scale factor as a variational parameter in the solution of the schrdinger equation using a basis of simple harmonic oscillator wave functions  @xcite : in that case it was shown that the optimal scale factor could be chosen to minimize the trace of the hamiltonian matrix in the hilbert subspace spanned by the @xmath7 elements of the basis . the same principle , which was inspired by the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite ,",
    "was then used in @xcite using a sinc collocation technique .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the sinc collocation has the great advantage of avoiding the evaluation of matrix elements of the potential , which is simply `` collocated '' at the grid points ; on the other hand the evaluation of the matrix elements of the non  relativistic kinetic operator is also quite simple , since it involves matrices whose elements are obtained by collocating the derivative of a given sinc function at the grid points . in this way one easily obtains a matrix representation for the hamiltonian .",
    "for example in one dimension one has h_kl = - c_kl^(2 ) + _ kl v(k h )  .",
    "[ collocnr ] where @xmath8 is the matrix obtained from the second derivative of the sinc functions .",
    "@xmath9 is the grid spacing .",
    "in the following we will set @xmath10 , so that @xmath9 will not be confused with the planck constant .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath11 allows one to obtain the eigenvalues ( energies ) and the eigenvectors ( wave functions ) of the problem ( the number of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors being equal to the number of sinc functions used ) .    before trying to deal with the rho in coordinate space , where it is non  local , we wish to use the vscm to find numerical solutions in momentum space , where it is local . in this case machinery of vscm",
    "applies straightforwardly and we are able to verify our claim of accuracy of our method . to allow a comparison with @xcite we have used @xmath12 and calculated the values of @xmath13 for @xmath14 using grids with different @xmath7 .",
    "the optimal region in momentum space has been obtained by applying the pms condition to the problem .",
    "our results show that the method converges quite rapidly ; as a matter of fact , for @xmath15 we obtain @xmath16 which has all the digits correct and agrees with the result shown in table 1 of @xcite , although the latter contains only @xmath17 digits .",
    "however we have also performed a more accurate test using the recurrence relations for the coefficients appearing in the series for the wave functions given in @xcite .",
    "we have extracted these coefficients by expanding around @xmath18 the wave function obtained with our method and we have compared them with the results obtained using directly the recurrence relation of eq.(8 ) of @xcite . in this way we have obtained an indipendent confirmation of the accuracy of our results .",
    "the importance of the rho lies in the unique possibility of having a complete control on the solutions of the problem , which can be calculated to any desired accuracy , despite retaining the non  local nature of the kinetic energy operator . in more general problems , when the potential is not quadratic in the coordinates , one can not recover a local schrdinger equation by working in the momentum space configuration . in these cases",
    "one possibility is to resort to a non ",
    "relativistic expansion in powers of @xmath19 , which to lowest order provides the rest mass and the usual non  relativistic kinetic energy : + +  [ eq2 ] however the hamiltonian operator obtained in this way contains derivatives of higher order . in such cases",
    "it is still possible to apply the vscm in coordinate space to solve these equations , by using the matrices corresponding to the higher order derivatives ( which can be computed quite easily ) .",
    "although the implementation of this procedure poses no problem , we wish to show that in certain cases it can provide unexpected results , such as results which converge to wrong solutions as the higher order relativistic corrections are added .",
    "we use once again the rho as our `` guinea pig '' and work in momentum space configuration using a potential obtained by expanding the kinetic term up to a give order in @xmath20 .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , for example , would represent the potential obtained working to order @xmath20 and corresponds to the usual non  relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "however , in the inclusion of the higher order terms we have to take into account that terms of order @xmath21 , with @xmath22 integer , are negative , and therefore one always needs to work to order @xmath23 to have a spectrum bounded from below .",
    "we call @xmath24 the potential in momentum space corresponding to the expansion to order @xmath23 . for example to order @xmath25 we have _",
    "3(p ) = + -+  .",
    "once we substitute the non  local operator with its local expansion to a given odd order we can solve the corresponding local schrdinger equation and thus obtain the energies and the wave functions .",
    "we have calculated the values of @xmath13 for the ground state of the potential using @xmath26 and two different values of @xmath2 ( @xmath12 and @xmath27 ) . in the case corresponding to @xmath28",
    "we have observed that the series converges to the exact result within @xmath29 digit precision for @xmath30 , while in the case corresponding to @xmath31 we have observed that the series does not converge to the exact result , providing its best approximation for @xmath32",
    ".    we can give a simple explanation of this behavior : for @xmath33 the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] )  where @xmath34 is now a real number  diverges and therefore the potential obtained using this series , @xmath35 , corresponds to the original potential with an infinite wall located at @xmath36 . in the case",
    "@xmath12 the wave function is extremely small at @xmath37 and therefore the non  relativistic expansion is capable of providing highly ( but not arbitrarily ) accurate results ; on the other hand , in the case @xmath38 the wave function is sizeable at @xmath36 and the non  relativistic expansion provides a very poor approximation . the situation would clearly get worse as @xmath2 is taken to be smaller .",
    "it should be stressed that in both cases the non  relativistic expansion does converge , although not to the exact result , but rather to a value which depends on the scale @xmath2 .",
    "i am not aware if this is a well - known fact in the literature .",
    "in this section we want to describe a new way of calculating the matrix elements of the relativistic kinetic energy operator , which avoids the problems of the local non  relativistic expansion described in the previous section .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there are approaches in the literature to calculate the matrix elements of this operator , although they are numerical .",
    "for example , the method described in @xcite consists of @xmath40 steps , i.e. the computation of @xmath41 , the diagonalization of @xmath42 , the computation of the diagonal square root matrix and finally the computation of the square root matrix @xmath43 .",
    "because of the calculation of @xmath43 is numerical this procedure would not be profitable in a variational scheme , where the pms condition is always analytical .",
    "however , we will now show that it is possible to obtain _ once and for all _ an analytical representation of @xmath39 and indeed of any non  local operator which is function of the momentum operator . because our results will be analytical it will be possible to extend the vscm to include relativistic non  local terms , in what we will call `` relativistic variational collocation method '' ( rvscm ) .",
    "let us now present our results .",
    "we will work in the following with the little sinc functions ( lsf ) of @xcite , although similar results can also be obtained with the usual sinc functions and keeping @xmath9 fixed the lsfs reduce to the sfs . ] .",
    "the lsf have been obtained in @xcite using the orthonormal basis of the wave functions of a particle in a box with infinite walls located at @xmath44 : _",
    "n(x ) =  ( ( x+l ) )  .",
    "a lsf is simply obtained as s_k(h , n , x ) & = & _ n=1^n _ n(x ) _",
    "n(y_k )  , where @xmath45 .",
    "the lsf should be regarded as an approximate representation of a dirac delta function . to simplify the notation we have introduced the grid spacing @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is an integer which takes the values @xmath48 , each corresponding to a different grid point .    as shown in @xcite an explicit expression for the lsf",
    "can be obtained for even values of @xmath7 in the form    s_k(h , n , x ) = \\ { - }  . [ sincls ]    after simple algebra one can also obtain the alternative expression    s_k(h , n , x ) = - _ n =- n^+n ( i)^n+1  ( + ) e^i    which is suited to calculate the action of @xmath39 over a lsf :     s_k(h , n , x ) = - _ n =- n^+n ( i)^n+1  ( + )  e^i  .    upon collocation on the grid , i.e. after setting @xmath49 , we have the matrix element    k_kj =   s_k(h , n , x_j ) = - _ n =- n^+n ( i)^n+1  ( + )  e^i  .",

    "( [ ksquare ] ) it can be seen that only the terms corresponding to @xmath56 contribute , whereas the remaining terms cancel out . in this case",
    "we obtain ( k^2)_kl & = & _ n_1=-n^+n _ n_2=-n^+n ( i)^n_1+n_2 + 2  ( + )   e^i   + & & ( - ( -i)^n1 + 1 ) ( _ n_1,n_2-_n_1,-n_2 ) + & = & - _ n =- n^+n ( i)^n+1  ( + )  e^i  .",
    "this completes our proof , since we have precisely obtained the expression that we would have reached if we had used eq .",

    "although the results obtained studying the rho are sufficient in our opinion to prove the efficiency and simplicity of the method that we are proposing in this paper , we wish to consider few examples which can better illustrate the power of our method .",

    "in this section we want to show that the method that we have developed in the previous section can also be applied to the calculation of matrix elements of other non  local operators .",

    "<S> we derive an alternative representation for the relativistic non  local kinetic energy operator and we apply it to solve the relativistic salpeter equation using the variational sinc collocation method . </S>",
    "<S> our representation is _ analytical _ and does not depend on an expansion in terms of local operators . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem to test our formula and we have found that arbitrarily precise results are obtained , simply increasing the number of grid points . </S>",
    "<S> more difficult problems have also been considered , observing in all cases the convergence of the numerical results . using these results </S>",
    "<S> we have also derived a new representation for the quantum mechanical green s function and for the corresponding path integral . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested this representation for a free particle in a box , recovering the exact result after taking the proper limits , and we have also found that the application of the feynman  kac formula to our green s function yields the correct ground state energy . our path integral representation allows to treat hamiltonians containing non  local operators and it could provide to the community a new tool to deal with such class of problems . </S>"
