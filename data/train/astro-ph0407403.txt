    "among the puzzles raised by the statistics of the recently discovered extrasolar giant planets ( hereafter egps ) is the origin of their eccentricities .",
    "the population of egps with periods larger than @xmath0  days displays an important scatter in eccentricity , which reaches for some systems values as extreme as @xmath1 , while most of the eccentricities of longer - period planets are almost uniformly distributed between  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 .",
    "several explanations have been envisaged to date in order to account for these eccentricities , such as planet - planet interactions ( rasio & ford 1996 , ford et al .",
    "2001 ) , external perturbers such as distant binary companions or passing stars ( holman et al .",
    "1997 , mazeh et al .",
    "1997 ) , or disk  planet interactions ( goldreich & sari 2003 , ogilvie & lubow 2003 and references therein ) . in this last case",
    "these interactions endow the giant protoplanets with non - vanishing eccentricities that remain after the dispersal of the disk . here",
    "we examine some aspects of this tidal excitation of the eccentricity of a giant protoplanet , by means of restricted numerical simulations . in order for these simulations to describe as closely as possible the resonances excited by an eccentric giant planet , it is useful to bear in mind their location and their action on the eccentricity . in table",
    "[ tab : reslist ] we indicate the ratio @xmath4 at the location of principal and first - order resonances and the impact of these resonances on the planet s eccentricity , where we denote by @xmath5 the orbital angular velocity of fluid elements in the disk , and by @xmath6 the planet s orbital frequency .",
    "the qualification _ fast _ refers to first - order terms of the potential that have the pattern frequency @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the planet s epicyclic frequency and @xmath9 the azimuthal wavenumber , while the _ slow _ denomination refers to first - order terms that have a pattern frequency @xmath10 . in table",
    "[ tab : reslist ] we neglect the slight sub - keplerianity of the disk due to the radial pressure gradient , we also neglect the slight offset between the nominal position of a lindblad resonance and its effective position ( corresponding to the turning point in the wkb dispersion relation of density waves in the disk ) , and we exploit the keplerian degeneracy @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in the case of an embedded giant protoplanet that clears a gap around its orbit , none of the co - orbital resonances ( the principal corotation resonances , the fast first - order outer lindblad resonances and the slow first - order inner lindblad resonances ) contributes to the exchange of energy and angular momentum with the planet , and the eccentricity budget of the planet is therefore determined by the extreme lindblad resonances ( the fast ilr and the slow olr ) , which excite the eccentricity , and by the first - order corotation resonances , which damp it .",
    "it has long been known that the damping provided by the crs slightly exceeds the excitation due to the lrs .",
    "goldreich & tremaine ( 1980 ) , using the large-@xmath9 bessel - function approximation for the torques and treating  @xmath9 as a continuous variable ( an approximation which might not be accurate for the gap - opening giant planets which involve low @xmath9-values ) , have shown that the corotation resonances dominate over the lindblad resonances by a @xmath13% amount .",
    "the corotation resonances can however easily saturate , unlike the lindblad resonances . if they reach a @xmath13% saturation , the net effect on the eccentricity is an excitation .",
    "ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) and goldreich & sari ( 2003 ) have studied the saturation properties of an isolated corotation resonance .",
    "the saturation of a corotation resonance results from the competition between libration ( which tends to flatten the vortensity profile across the libration islands of the resonance ) and viscous diffusion ( which tends to establish the large - scale gradient of vortensity over the width of the libration islands ) .",
    "the saturation of a resonance therefore requires a sufficiently small viscosity , for a given resonance width . for a given mass and eccentricity of the planet",
    ", there exists a critical viscosity below which the planet undergoes an eccentricity excitation , at least according to the balance between the resonant interactions .",
    "ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) show that for a planet - to - primary mass ratio @xmath14 , and a disk with aspect ratio @xmath15 , a starting eccentricity of order @xmath16 is sufficient to trigger an eccentricity growth .",
    "their analysis however neglected the fact that non - co - orbital corotation resonances are not isolated .",
    "successive corotation resonances can indeed overlap , and these resonances share their location with the principal lindblad resonances , as can be seen in table  [ tab : reslist ] .",
    "this work aims at studying the properties of a non - isolated corotation resonance by means of numerical simulations .",
    "our analysis is threefold : we first check that numerical simulations of an isolated corotation resonance provide results in agreement with the analytical theory , then we investigate the properties of a pair of corotation resonances of similar strength with wave - numbers that differ by  @xmath17 , from the well separated case to the strongly overlapping case , and , finally , we investigate the behavior of a first - order corotation resonance that lies at the location of a principal lindblad resonance . disentangling the torque from each resonance in that last case is made possible by the fact that the azimuthal wavenumber of the lindblad resonance and that of the corotation resonance differ by  @xmath17 , as can be seen in table  [ tab : reslist ] .",
    "in order for the torque arising from each component of equation  ( [ eq : pot ] ) to correspond only to a specific resonance , some care must be taken about the radial width over which the disk is torqued .",
    "one can either adopt a profile @xmath26 that is non - vanishing on a radial range smaller than that of the computational domain , or one can adopt a constant @xmath26 profile and a sufficiently narrow computational domain , so as to remain everywhere sufficiently far from the other resonances associated to that potential component ( e.g. from the lindblad resonances in the case we want to consider a corotation resonance ) .",
    "we have adopted this second solution , and we work on radially narrow meshes .",
    "namely , we consider low-@xmath9 resonances ( @xmath32  or  @xmath33 ) . for the less favorable case @xmath34 , the lr to cr radius ratios are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we want the computational domain to avoid the lr locations , at least by typically two or three driving lengths ( meyer - vernet & sicardy 1987 ) : @xmath37 this implies that we have a sufficiently thin disk ( the `` standard '' choice @xmath15 , for which the driving length is @xmath38 , would give marginally too large lindblad resonance widths , since the corotation resonance   which is at least as large as @xmath39   would slightly overlap the perturbation inside of the olr ) .",
    "instead , we use a much thinner disk ( @xmath40 ) for which the wave driving length at the lindblad resonance is approximately three times shorter . with this choice",
    ", we can safely consider two distinct corotation resonances that are well separated from the lindblad resonances .",
    "far from an isolated corotation resonance , but still inside of the band forbidden for the propagation of acoustic perturbations around corotation , the perturbation corresponds to an evanescent wave , with a purely imaginary radial wave - number given by : @xmath41-\\frac{m_i^2}{r^2}\\ ] ] obtained from the dispersion relation of a density wave in a keplerian disk . in the case where we consider only corotation resonances , we evaluate this wave - number for each resonance @xmath42 at the mesh boundaries , and we apply the following procedure :    * we evaluate the azimuthal fourier transform of the hydrodynamic variables ( surface density , radial and azimuthal velocities ) with wavenumber @xmath28 , in the second ring at the inner boundary and in the penultimate ring at the outer boundary : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is any of the aforementioned quantities on the corresponding ring , and where @xmath45 is the number of zones of the mesh in azimuth . * we then overwrite the content of the first ring ( at the inner boundary ) and of the last ring ( at the outer boundary ) with : @xmath46\\exp(-|k_{r_i}|\\delta r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the radial resolution of the mesh , and where @xmath48 stands for the unperturbed hydrodynamic variable .",
    "this simple prescription ensures a correct description at the mesh boundaries of the evanescent waves arising for all the corotation resonances .    in the case where one considers both a corotation resonance and a lindblad resonance ,",
    "a similar procedure does not produce satisfactory results , and the computational domain is rapidly invaded by spurious propagating waves .",
    "we then turn to a procedure proposed by kley , nelson & artymowicz for a comparison test problempawel / planets / test.hydro.html ] , in which the perturbation is artificially damped on a short range of radius near either boundary .",
    "although this prescription mangles the response of the disk to a corotation resonance near its boundaries , it is very effective at avoiding the reflection of the wave launched at the lindblad resonance .",
    "the mechanism we want to investigate relies on a minute motion inside libration islands , which involves very small radial velocities .",
    "the idealized picture of these libration islands can easily be mangled by an inaccurate initial centrifugal balance , which gives rise to axisymmetric waves with an associated radial velocity which can be larger than the one corresponding to libration .",
    "it is therefore critical to impose a strict centrifugal balance at @xmath49 , which takes into account the discretization of the problem on the mesh . since the mesh is staggered",
    "there is an infinite number of sequences @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the radial number of zones of the mesh ) that lead to a strict centrifugal balance .",
    "we choose the one that minimizes the quantity @xmath52 defined by : @xmath53      the total torque exerted by the potential on the disk is evaluated as :    @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the surface area of zone @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively the surface density and gravitational potential pertaining to the center of this zone , and @xmath59 the resolution in azimuth .",
    "we shall also use the torque exerted on the disk by the specific potential component with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath9 .",
    "its expression is given by :    @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath61    the value of @xmath62 coincides exactly with the value of @xmath63 whenever only one potential component is present , regardless of the resolution .",
    "as in a large number of publications on the disk  planet tidal interaction problem , the mass unit is the mass of the central object , the distance unit is arbitrary ( in what follows it either corresponds to the corotation radius of an isolated resonance , or the mean of the corotation radii of two resonances ) , and the time unit is @xmath64 , where @xmath5 is the keplerian angular speed at @xmath65 .",
    "the surface density is initially uniform and equal to one .",
    "in a first step we have checked what resolution was needed for the code to properly capture the torque properties ( unsaturated torque value and saturation properties ) in the case of an isolated corotation resonance . for this purpose , we have made a number of test calculations with different resolutions and viscosities .",
    "our first setup consists of an isolated @xmath34 resonance at frequency @xmath66 .",
    "the inner mesh boundary is located at @xmath67 , and the outer mesh boundary is located at @xmath68 .",
    "the potential is turned on on a time - scale @xmath69  @xmath64 .",
    "the number of zones in @xmath24 is set to @xmath70 , which means that each libration island spans @xmath71  zones azimuthally .",
    "the width of the libration islands is given , if one neglects pressure effects , by @xmath72 where    @xmath73 is the characteristic length - scale for libration in a keplerian disk ( ogilvie & lubow 2003 ) .",
    "the forcing potential amplitude is @xmath74 , so the width of the libration islands , neglecting pressure effects , is @xmath75 .",
    "this typically corresponds to a jupiter - sized planet orbiting a solar - type star on an eccentric orbit with @xmath76 .",
    "we have tried to vary the number of zones radially , from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "this corresponds to a radial sampling of the libration islands that varies from @xmath33 to @xmath79  zones . in this last case ,",
    "the number of zones over which a libration island is described is approximately the same in azimuth and radius .",
    "the kinematic viscosity is either set to @xmath2 , in which case diffusion is only of numerical origin , or to the constant value @xmath80 , which corresponds to a small ( @xmath81% ) saturation of the resonance .",
    "this can be evaluated by using the saturation parameter introduced by ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) , the expression of which , in a keplerian disk , is    @xmath82    which leads in our case to the value @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84% saturation is then deduced using equation  ( 66 ) of ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) , which holds for slightly saturated resonances .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "one can notice an oscillatory behavior of the torque value in the inviscid case , with a period of the order of the libration time    @xmath85    the torque value at large viscosity is in correct agreement with the estimate that can be deduced from the goldreich & tremaine ( 1980 ) formula that leads to : @xmath86 the expected torque value is therefore @xmath84% smaller in absolute value , i.e. @xmath87 . the error in the torque given by our calculation is therefore typically @xmath13% .",
    "one can also notice that the unsaturated torque value is very well described even at low radial resolution ( bottom curves ) .",
    "this had already been noticed by masset ( 2002 ) in the context of the horseshoe region torque . on the contrary ,",
    "the curves of different resolutions noticeably differ in the inviscid case .",
    "the expected behavior is that the torque tends toward zero ( saturates ) as time goes to infinity .",
    "the three highest resolutions seem to be in reasonable agreement with this expectation , within a small offset . the case of lowest resolution , however , does have a significant residual torque at large @xmath25 , and does not exhibit any oscillatory behavior .",
    "it is likely that at these low resolutions the numerical diffusion itself acts to unsaturate the torque .",
    "one can also note that the oscillatory behavior of the torque , in the inviscid case , increases as the resolution increases .    in figure",
    "[ fig : two ] we plot the dimensionless residual torque value at large time as a function of the resolution , expressed as the number of zones spanned by the libration islands .",
    "we see that a resolution @xmath88 of @xmath89 to @xmath79 is sufficient to ensure a residual unsaturation of about @xmath17% after approximately 1000  orbits .    in figure",
    "[ fig : three ] we plot the streamlines ( from the calculation with highest radial resolution ) in the inviscid case and in the viscous case .",
    "as we consider a thin disk , for which the pressure length - scale is of the order of the libration scale , the radial width of the libration islands is satisfactorily accounted for by the ballistic expression of equation  ( [ eq : width ] ) .",
    "we have performed additional calculations for the isolated corotation resonance case in order to investigate whether the viscosity prescription ( @xmath90 or @xmath91 , as used in the analysis of ogilvie & lubow 2003 ) , and the boundary condition prescription , could significantly alter the value and saturation properties of the corotation torque .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : four ] .",
    "the curves with diamonds show the results with a constant viscosity , while the curves with squares show the results with the viscosity prescription @xmath91 .",
    "all these calculations have @xmath92 or  @xmath93 .",
    "the solid lines show calculations with an inner boundary at @xmath94 and an outer boundary at @xmath95 , with damping boundary conditions on the @xmath84% inner and outer parts of the mesh .",
    "the dotted lines show calculations with the same boundary conditions but with an inner boundary at @xmath96 and an outer boundary at @xmath97 .",
    "finally the dashed lines show calculations with boundary conditions adapted to the evanescent waves .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines strictly have all same parameters , and differ only by their boundary conditions .",
    "one can make the following comments :    * there is a systematic offset between a uniform viscosity prescription and the @xmath91 prescription , which amounts to a bit less than 10% , the latter prescription leading to a more saturated resonance . *",
    "the calculation that one would expect to best fit the analytical results of ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) is the one with adapted boundary conditions and a @xmath91 prescription .",
    "this corresponds to the dashed line with squares .",
    "although it satisfactorily agrees with the theoretical expectations for @xmath98 , it leads to a resonance that is less saturated than expected for larger values of @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the measured dimensionless torque is offset of @xmath101 from its analytical estimate .",
    "such an offset is unlikely to be due to numerical diffusion , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "* damping boundary conditions have a small but measurable impact on the fully unsaturated torque value .",
    "this might be linked to the fact that with the radially extended mesh that we consider , the boundaries lie within @xmath102 driving lengths from the lindblad resonances . in any case , whenever we shall study a situation with two resonances ( either two corotation resonances or one corotation resonance and one lindblad resonance ) , we will compare our results to the isolated corotation resonance case by performing separately an isolated resonance test calculation , with exactly the same boundary location and prescription .",
    "we have performed a first set of calculations in which we consider the @xmath34 corotation resonance presented at length in the previous section ( @xmath74 , @xmath66 ) , and a second resonance , with potential amplitude @xmath103 , with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath104 , and with frequency @xmath105 such that the corotation radius is located at @xmath106 , where @xmath107 takes the following values : @xmath108 . with the largest separation ( @xmath109 ) , the resonances are well apart and their distance in radius amounts to slightly more than @xmath33 times the sum of their half - widths , while for the smallest separation , the distance between the corotation radii amounts to only 16% of the sum of their half - widths , so the resonances strongly overlap .",
    "for each two - resonance calculation , two other separate calculations with exactly the same parameters are performed , in which one only of the resonances is present .",
    "we have performed all these calculations with three different values for the viscosity ( chosen here as uniform ) : @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the first choice corresponds to a low value of the @xmath99 parameter , and to resonances that are therefore almost unsaturated , while the second choice corresponds to values of @xmath99 that are close to unity ( @xmath113 for the @xmath34 resonance , and @xmath114 for the @xmath104 resonance as well , with an exact value that depends on @xmath107 ) .",
    "the mesh parameters were @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : five ] we show results for four values of the separation ( @xmath119 ) of the highly viscous case . on these plots the variable @xmath120 represents the distance between the corotation radii of the two resonances , @xmath121 is the @xmath34 resonance width , and @xmath122 is the @xmath104 resonance width , estimated with the ballistic approximation of equation  ( [ eq : width ] ) .",
    "the resonances should overlap when the parameter @xmath123 becomes smaller than unity , i.e. when the distance between the corotation radii is smaller than the sum of the resonances half - widths .",
    "the variable @xmath124 features in figure  [ fig : five ] .",
    "it represents the amount of time that separates identical configurations of potential components : @xmath125    when the two resonances overlap , a passive scalar advected by the flow displays a highly time - dependent behavior , and remarkably , in this highly viscous case , this has no impact on the torque value .",
    "the two - resonance torque value is almost insensitive to the resonance overlap , and exhibits a value that is nearly constant in time , whatever the value of @xmath126 . a tentative explanation for this property could be the following :",
    "ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) have emphasized that the nonlinear effect on the corotation torque of an isolated resonance can be understood as the feedback of the perturbation on the vortensity gradient of the disk , and this is likely generalizable to a set of corotation resonances . for a viscosity large enough that the viscous timescale across the libration islands be shorter than any other timescale ( libration timescale or beating timescale ) ,",
    "the vortensity gradient across the resonances is hardly modified with respect to its unperturbed value , hence nonlinear effects should be negligible and the torque value should be the sum of the linear estimates for each resonance .      in figure",
    "[ fig : six ] we show results for six values of the separation ( @xmath127 ) of the moderately viscous case . on these curves",
    "one can see that the two - resonance torque is nearly equal to the sum of the one - resonance torques when the resonances are separated ( @xmath128 ) , although there exists a small but noticeable difference between these two values that increases as @xmath126 gets close to unity .",
    "when both resonances overlap ( bottom panels ) , the time - averaged two - resonance torque value can be either larger ( in absolute value , for @xmath129 ) or smaller ( for @xmath130 or @xmath131 ) than the sum of the one - resonance torque values .",
    "one can also notice a torque modulation with period @xmath124 .",
    "the findings of the highly viscous case therefore do not hold , even for the time - averaged values .",
    "note that @xmath124 is only the shortest period over which one can expect the torque modulation to occur , while the longest is @xmath132 $ ] , where @xmath133 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath9 and @xmath134 , which is @xmath17 in the case where @xmath135 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : seven ] we show results for six values of the separation ( @xmath127 ) of the inviscid case .",
    "again the solid and dashed - dotted curves are almost indistinguishable by eye when the resonances do not overlap ( @xmath136 , corresponding to the top panels ) , while they are markedly different when they overlap ( @xmath137 , bottom panels ) . all curves slowly decay in absolute value .",
    "this is normal for the one - resonance torques and their sum , as the corotation torque in that case tends to saturate , and it is reasonable to expect it also to saturate , on the average , in the two - resonance case .",
    "a quasi - periodic torque modulation is apparent for the closest case ( right - bottom plot ) , with a pseudo - period that corresponds to @xmath138 .",
    "we have performed calculations similar to the illustrative cases of two corotation resonances of the previous paragraphs , with a more systematic exploration of the ( separation , saturation ) parameter space .",
    "our aim is to check the following trends :    1 .",
    "the two - resonance torque value is the sum of the one - resonance torques , whenever the viscosity is high or the resonances do not overlap .",
    "the two - resonance torque value of overlapping resonances saturates at low viscosities , in a fashion that is similar to the saturation of a one - resonance torque .",
    "the time - averaged torque value of two overlapping resonances for a small or moderate viscosity may sensibly differ from the sum of the isolated resonances torques , but it never exceeds the sum of the fully unsaturated isolated resonance torques .",
    "we therefore set up the following series of calculations :    * we consider two fixed corotation resonances , with frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers respectively @xmath139 and @xmath34 , and @xmath140 and @xmath104 .",
    "these resonances have the same forcing potential amplitude @xmath141 , which we vary .",
    "the disk still has @xmath40 , the mesh has @xmath78 by @xmath118 zones , the inner mesh boundary is at @xmath142 , the outer mesh boundary is at @xmath143 .",
    "the potential is turned on on the time - scale @xmath144 .",
    "we use damping boundary conditions . *",
    "the amplitude of the forcing potential is chosen such that the parameter @xmath145 takes the following values : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , i.e. from well separated resonances to strongly overlapping resonances . in the above expression @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    "are evaluated as if the resonance frequencies were both @xmath66 , therefore @xmath162 since the libration island width , in the ballistic approximation , does not depend on @xmath9 . * the viscosity",
    "is varied such that the saturation parameter , given by equation  ( [ eq : sat ] ) , of the `` mean '' fictitious resonance that would have @xmath66 , the same forcing potential as the two resonances considered , and @xmath163 , would take the values @xmath164 . *",
    "each calculation is performed over a time that is larger than the libration time of each resonance , the beating time between them , and the viscous time across each libration zone .",
    "the torque is then measured and averaged over the last beating time . *",
    "the same procedure is repeated for two other calculations in which only one of the resonances is present , and which is performed over exactly the same time , and again the torque is measured and time - averaged over the same temporal window ( although the beating time is then meaningless ) .",
    "the whole calculation therefore amounts in total to @xmath165 such runs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eight ] we plot the ratio of the time - averaged two - resonance torque to the sum the one - resonance torques , as a function of viscosity and resonance separation .",
    "as expected , the result is very close to unity near the top and left axes , which respectively correspond to the well separated case and the highly viscous case .",
    "this confirms the expectation  1 above .",
    "the fact that the ratio plotted in figure  [ fig : eight ] does not differ from unity by more than roughly @xmath166% confirms the expectation  2 above , i.e. the saturation curve of total torque vs. @xmath99 , taken at any given value for the overlap parameter , does not significantly differ from the sum of the saturation curves of the corresponding resonances , considered as isolated .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : nine ] the ratio of the two - resonance torque value to the sum of the fully unsaturated torque values of both resonances , as a function of viscosity and resonance separation .",
    "this ratio can be seen to never exceed unity , which confirms expectation  3 above .",
    "as the first - order corotation resonances lie on top of principal lindblad resonances , we have addressed the restricted problem of the saturation of one corotation resonance that exactly overlaps a lindblad resonance .",
    "we have examined the consequences of this overlap in two different situations :    * the lindblad torque is small enough so that it does not significantly affect the azimuthally averaged radial profile of surface density .",
    "this allows us to compare directly the corotation torque value with its value in the case no lindblad resonance is present . * the lindblad torque is large and significantly redistribute the disk material and thus it considerably alters the slope of vortensity across the resonance . in that case ,",
    "a direct comparison with a single corotation calculation is not possible .",
    "rather , we measure the slope of vortensity across the resonance and compare the value of the unsaturated resonance to the goldreich & tremaine estimate .",
    "we consider a corotation resonance excited by a potential with wavenumber @xmath34 , frequency @xmath167 and amplitude @xmath168 , which has exactly the same location as a lindblad resonance excited by a potential with wavenumber @xmath104 , frequency @xmath169 and amplitude @xmath170 .",
    "for the case of an eccentric planet , this corresponds to a slow first - order corotation resonance overlapping a principal outer lindblad resonance .",
    "the reason why we consider such a low - amplitude forcing potential for the corotation resonance is that we wish the onset of possible non - linear effects between the corotation and lindblad resonances to be as low as possible .",
    "our mesh extends from @xmath142 to @xmath143 , its resolution is @xmath171 by @xmath118 .",
    "the radial resolution is large in order to have a satisfactory resolution of the narrow libration islands of the corotation resonance .",
    "the potentials are turned on over the time - scale @xmath172 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ten ] we plot the torque value of the corotation resonance as a function of time for different values of the viscosity , corresponding to an arithmetic sequence of the saturation parameter @xmath99 , for a mixed corotation / lindblad resonance and for the case of an isolated corotation resonance with the same characteristics .",
    "both series of curves exhibit very similar trends .",
    "the torque of the isolated resonance tends to oscillate more than the one overlapping a lindblad resonance , at low viscosity .",
    "one can also notice the very long libration time , due to the narrowness of the libration islands .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eleven ] we plot the dimensionless torque as a function of the saturation parameter , obtained from the time average of the torque values presented in figure  [ fig : ten ] , over the interval @xmath173 .    the time - averaged torque estimate at low viscosity , especially for the isolated resonance ,",
    "may be slightly biased by the fact that it has not enough time to reach a steady saturation level over the full duration of the calculation .",
    "the impact of this bias is however small , and the conclusion that can be drawn from the examination of figure  [ fig : eleven ] is that the torque saturation properties are hardly affected by the presence of the underlying lindblad resonance . the tiny difference between both curves can be attributed either to the relatively small number of libration times over which the time average is performed ( at low viscosity ) or to the slight radial redistribution of the disk material under the action of the lindblad torque . the tiny change of the vortensity slope , defined as @xmath174 ( where @xmath175 is the second oort s constant ) , can indeed be estimated to be of the order of a few percent , compatible with the discrepancy of the two saturation curves .      we have also performed a test calculation in which the forcing potential amplitude of the lindblad resonance is much larger , so that it modifies the surface density profile , in a reduced version of what occurs at a gap edge .",
    "we can not vary the viscosity in this kind of calculation , as we want the surface density profile to converge toward the redistributed profile in a reasonable amount of time . at viscosities low enough to significantly saturate the corotation torque ,",
    "the viscous time - scale across the excavated region becomes prohibitively large .",
    "we therefore just compare the corotation torque value to the goldreich & tremaine estimate , obtained by measuring the slope of @xmath176 across the resonance width at any instant in time . in figure",
    "[ fig : twelve ] , the left panel shows the comparison between this estimate and the actual corotation torque value .",
    "they agree to within a few percent , and the actual torque value is slightly smaller than the goldreich  tremaine estimate .",
    "the parameters that we adopted for this calculation are :    * @xmath74 , @xmath34 and @xmath66 for the corotation resonance , * @xmath177 , @xmath104 and @xmath178 for the lindblad resonance .",
    "this frequency implies that it is an ilr .",
    "if we wanted to strictly reproduce the overlap between a first - order corotation resonance and a principal inner lindblad resonance , we should have @xmath179 .",
    "we have chosen instead @xmath180 , which allows us to better resolve the wave launched at the lindblad resonance for a given value of @xmath45 .",
    "we anticipate that our conclusions are not affected by this choice .",
    "the above sections essentially validate the previous work of ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) on the saturation of an isolated corotation resonance , in the context of the first - order corotation resonances of an eccentric giant planet , which are not isolated .",
    "the numerical simulations performed thus far on the problem of the eccentricity excitation of a giant planet did not exhibit any eccentricity growth for jupiter - sized giant planets ( papaloizou et al .",
    "2001 ) . while there may be a number of reasons for that , we show in this section how the corotation torque estimate is mangled at very low resolution , i.e. when the width of the libration islands is of the order of the mesh radial size .",
    "the width of a first - order corotation resonance is given by : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the mass ratio and @xmath183 is a factor of order unity given in tables 1 and 2 of ogilvie & lubow ( 2003 ) .",
    "assuming one has a jupiter - sized planet orbiting a solar mass star ( @xmath184 ) with eccentricity @xmath16 , the resonance width is therefore @xmath185 .",
    "as a point of comparison , in run n1 in papaloizou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which corresponds to a jupiter - sized giant planet , the radial resolution is @xmath186 .",
    "figure  [ fig : thirteen ] shows the results ( as before , diamonds are for a uniform viscosity prescription while squares are for a @xmath91 viscosity prescription ) .",
    "the solid lines are for a resolution @xmath187 , the dotted one @xmath188 and the dashed one @xmath189 .",
    "this shows again that the value of the fully unsaturated corotation torque is relatively well reproduced even at very low resolution , but the saturated resonant torque is completely mangled at low resolution .",
    "the case @xmath190 is particularly striking , since in this case one gets a torque value larger than the goldreich & tremaine estimate . therefore in a low - resolution simulation of an embedded giant planet , as soon as the eccentricity gets to values which give the libration islands a size comparable to the radial resolution , these effects could lead to a strong spurious damping of the eccentricity , which would therefore be bounded by small values ( @xmath191 $ ] , depending on the resolution ) .",
    "by means of reduced two - dimensional numerical simulations , involving two resonances at the same time and each resonance separately in order to compare the isolated case to the two - resonance case , we reach the following conclusions :    * the corotation torque of two overlapping resonances coincides with the sum of the corotation torques of each resonance , considered as isolated , either when the resonances do not overlap ( their separation is larger than the sum of the half - widths of their libration islands ) or when the viscosity is large ( fully unsaturated resonances ) . *",
    "when the resonances overlap and are partially saturated , the two - resonance torque may differ at most by a few tens of percent from the sum of the isolated torques , evaluated for the same viscosity .",
    "this implies that a given degree of saturation of a non - isolated resonance is reached for a value of the viscosity of the same order of magnitude as the viscosity needed to achieve the same degree of saturation for the isolated resonance .",
    "* the time - averaged two - resonance torque never exceeds the sum of the goldreich & tremaine estimates of each resonance . * in the case where a corotation resonance overlaps a weak lindblad resonance ( that does not significantly redistribute the vortensity profile ) , the time - averaged torque value differs from the isolated case by at most a few percent , whatever the value of the viscosity .",
    "* in the case where a corotation resonance overlaps a strong lindblad resonance , for which our calculations are limited to high - viscosity situations , the time - averaged torque value corresponds to the goldreich & tremaine estimate , i.e. to the torque of the unsaturated corotation resonance , considered as isolated . *",
    "the only case in which we have observed a corotation torque value that is larger than the goldreich & tremaine estimate ( which therefore jeopardizes an eccentricity excitation for the set of parameters quoted in the introduction ) is when the mesh resolution is too low .",
    "this is therefore a numerical artifact , and we conclude that a high resolution is needed in the region of first - order corotation resonance ( i.e. close to the gap edges ) in order to observe an eccentricity excitation , with libration islands spanning at least about @xmath192 zones radially .    finally , we emphasize that the saturation of the first - order corotation resonances is only one of the factors determining whether the eccentricity of a giant protoplanet grows or decays through its interaction with the disk .",
    "an aspect of this problem that tends to be overlooked is the secular exchange of eccentricity between the planet and the disk , which may occur on a time - scale of thousands of orbital periods .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this exchange is sometimes referred to as the apsidal resonance ( goldreich & sari 2003 ) , although this resonance is so broad in a nearly keplerian disk that we prefer to avoid this denomination . when a planet is placed on an elliptical orbit in a circular disk , its eccentricity should initially decrease as eccentricity",
    "is imparted to the disk .",
    "this exchange can , in principle , occur in a way that conserves the angular momentum deficit of the coupled disk  planet system , in which case the eccentricity of the planet will be restored later in the cycle of secular exchange .",
    "therefore , a transient decrease of the planet s eccentricity in such circumstances should not be confused with eccentricity damping . in the analogous problem of the secular inclination dynamics of coupled disk  planet systems ,",
    "lubow & ogilvie ( 2001 ) have defined a positive - definite measure of the bending disturbance of the system , equivalent to an angular momentum deficit , which is conserved in the secular exchange and evolves only through the effects of mean - motion resonances and viscous damping .",
    "papaloizou ( 2002 ) has also treated aspects of the eccentricity dynamics of coupled disk  planet systems , while ogilvie ( 2001 ) has drawn attention to the subtle issue of whether eccentricity is damped or excited by viscous or turbulent stresses in the disk , and at what rate .",
    "a fully self - consistent calculation therefore involves many additional complications , such as the treatment of the force arising from the material inside of the roche lobe , the role of self - gravity , and the eccentric coupling between the disk and the planet through the apsidal waves .",
    "it will be presented in a forthcoming work .",
