    "this paper reports on the first three semesters of data ( with 5645 quasars ) and presents the @xmath12 quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) to fainter luminosities at each redshift than either the sdss or 2qz surveys alone .",
    "the first determination of the luminosity function of quasars was by schmidt ( 1968 ) .",

    "2003 ; barger et al .",
    "these x - ray qlfs have also been shown to exhibit a break , but generally at luminosities much fainter than found by optical surveys ; this result suggests incompleteness at the faint end of optical surveys .",

    "we probe nearly 1 magnitude deeper than 2qz , and find that the faint end slope of the qlf is steeper than that of the most recent 2qz determination and lacks a strong characteristic break feature , but is still better characterized by a double - power law than a single power - law .",

    "these restrictions are designed to ensure that the errors on the magnitudes are reasonably small ( and thus that the resulting colours are accurate ) , but also are sufficiently relaxed that , when coupled with the magnitude cut in @xmath23 and @xmath27 , objects with quasar - like continua are not rejected .",
    "this tolerance is necessary since , as we go fainter , restrictions on magnitude errors are effectively cuts in magnitude and any two such restrictions are effectively colour cuts .",

    ". the faint sample has @xmath39 and probes roughly one magnitude deeper than 2qz .",

    "2002 ) have developed a bayesian star - galaxy classifier that is robust to @xmath43 . as a result ,",

    "are placed along the central declination of the two strips ; @xmath73 for the north galactic pole ( ngp ) strip and @xmath74 for the south galactic pole strip ; see   [ sec : skyloc ] .",
    "each field centre is separated by 1.2 degrees , although some early observations of the ngp at the start of 2003 had field spacings of 1 degree .    the target list generated from the process described in   [",

    "all available high priority targets are allocated before moving to the next priority level .",
    "for source densities much greater than 400 per 2df field , the 2df configuration algorithm will tend to give a non - uniform distribution of fibres allocated to objects ( cannon et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore the main samples of each of the lrg and qso data sets were randomly sampled to a surface density of 200 per 2df field and these given priority 8 and 6 for the lrgs and qsos respectively .",

    "for the qso sample we used the low resolution 300b grating ( as used for the 2qz ) , but the lrg observations required the use of the higher resolution 600v grating .",

    ", each block of 10 fibres ( a retractor block ) goes to an alternate spectrograph , so that 200 fibres on each plate are available for the qsos and 200 for the lrgs .",
    "2df fibres are limited to a maximum off - radial angle of 14 degrees , therefore there are 20 small triangles surrounding the edge of the 2df fields that are inaccessible to the qso spectrograph covering a total area of 0.43 deg@xmath2 .",

    "in particular , models like those of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) , wyithe & loeb ( 2002 ) , and others that attempt to explain the evolution of galaxies and quasars , rely on comparison with accurate observational determinations of the qlf .",
    "in fact , although the optical qlf presented herein is arguably the most robust determination to date for a large optically selected sample , for many applications an x - ray or far - ir qlf is more appropriate .",
    "that said , the luminosity function of optically selected quasars will remain an important tool for extragalactic astronomy .",
    "the primary reason for this is the sheer size of the optical quasar sample ( likely over 300,000 in the current sdss imaging data alone ; richards et  al .",
    "2004a ) . while the deepest x - ray surveys may uncover thousands of agns per square degree , they do so over only a fraction of a square degree and the sum total area of the sky covered by both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ is unlikely to ever exceed even 1 per cent .",
    "ir surveys with _ spitzer _ will cover a somewhat larger area than x - ray surveys , but not at nearly the same space density as in the x - ray or with nearly the same total number as in the shallower , but much wider optical surveys .",
    "thus , this sample of faint quasars and the luminosity function derived from it will continue to provide important inputs to future extragalactic investigations such as the dark energy survey ( des ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",

    "<S> , we find a faint end slope of @xmath4 if we allow all of the parameters to vary and @xmath5 if we allow only the faint end slope and normalization to vary ( holding all other parameters equal to the final 2qz values ) . </S>",
    "<S> over the magnitude range covered by the 2slaq survey , our maximum likelihood fit to the data yields 32 per cent more quasars than the final 2qz parameterization , but is not inconsistent with other @xmath6 deep surveys for quasars . </S>",
    "<S> the 2slaq data exhibit no well defined `` break '' in the number counts or luminosity function , but do clearly flatten with increasing magnitude . finally , we find that the shape of the quasar luminosity function derived from 2slaq is in good agreement with that derived from type i quasars found in hard x - ray surveys .    </S>",
