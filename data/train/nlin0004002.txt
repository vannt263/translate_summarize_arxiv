    "the separation of variables belongs to the basic methods of mathematical physics from the previous century . originating from the early works of dalambert ( the @xmath0__th _ _ century ) , fourier and jacobi ( the first half of the @xmath1__th _ _ century ) , for many decades it has been the only known method of exact solution of dynamical systems .",
    "let us briefly recall the idea from classical mechanics . consider a hamiltonian mechanical system of @xmath2 degrees of freedom and integrable in the sense of liouville / arnold theorem .",
    "this means that there exist @xmath3 linearly independent functions @xmath4(hamiltonians ) which are in involution with respect to the canonical poisson bracket @xmath5 a system of canonical variables @xmath6@xmath7 is called separated @xcite if there exist @xmath3 relations of the form @xmath8 joining each pair @xmath9 of conjugate coordinates and all hamiltonians @xmath10 fixing the values of hamiltonians @xmath11 one obtains from ( [ 3 ] ) an explicit factorization of the liouville tori given by the equations @xmath12 in the hamilton - jacobi method , for a given hamiltonian function @xmath13 we are looking for a canonical transformation @xmath14 in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a generating function given by the related hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath17 if @xmath18 are separated coordinates , then @xmath19 and the partial differential equation ( [ 5 ] ) splits into @xmath3 ordinary differential equations @xmath20 just of the form ( [ 4 ] ) . in @xmath21 coordinates the flow is trivial @xmath22 and the implicit form of the trajectories @xmath23 is the following @xmath24 so , given a set of separated variables , it is possible to solve a related dynamical system by quadratures . in the @xmath25 century and",
    "most of the present century , for a number of models of classical mechanics the separated variables were either guessed or found by some _ ad hoc _ methods .",
    "for example , in the second half of the @xmath1__th _ _ century , neumann s investigation of a particle moving on a sphere under the action of a linear force @xcite and jacobi s study of the geodesics motion on an ellipsoid @xcite exploited the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation to solve the equations of motion by quadratures . in @xmath26",
    "stckel initiated the program dealing the classification of hamiltonian systems according to their separability or nonseparability , presenting conditions for separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation in orthogonal coordinates @xcite .",
    "for three dimensional flat space , the @xmath27 possible coordinate systems in which separation may take place were deduced in a paper by eisenhart @xcite .",
    "they were all obtained as degenerations of the confocal ellipsoidal coordinates @xcite . for each of the coordinates eisenhart @xcite determined the form of the potential that permitted a separation of variables .",
    "these potentials , designated stckel or separable potentials , played a crucial role in hamiltonian mechanics before the development of more qualitative geometric methods for differential equations .",
    "although in all classical papers the transformation to separated coordinates was searched in the form of point transformations , nevertheless they can be produced by an arbitrary canonical transformation involving both coordinates and momenta .",
    "a fundamental progress in the theory of separability was made in 1985 , when sklyanin adopted the method of soliton systems , i.e. the lax representation , to systematic derivation of separated variables ( see his review article @xcite ) .",
    "it was the first constructive theory of separated coordinates for dynamical systems .",
    "in his approach , the appropriate hamiltonians appear as coefficients of the spectral curve , i.e. the characteristic equation of lax matrix .",
    "his method was successfully applied to separation of variables for many old and new integrable systems @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a new constructive separability theory , which has been recently intensely developed , based on a bi - hamiltonian property of integrable systems . in last decade a considerable progress has been made in construction of new integrable finite dimensional dynamical systems showing bi - hamiltonian property .",
    "the majority of them originate from stationary flows , restricted flows or nonlinearization of lax equations of underlying soliton systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "quite recently a fundamental property of such systems has been discovered , i.e. their separability .",
    "it was proved @xcite-@xcite that most bi - hamiltonian finite dimensional chains , which start with a casimir of the first poisson structure and terminate with a casimir of the second poisson structure , are integrable by quadratures , through the solutions of the appropriate hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the presented review article is based on results of papers @xcite-@xcite systematizing and unifying them into a compact separability theory in the frame of the set of canonical coordinates .",
    "the results derived so far are sufficiently promising to consider the theory as an alternative or complement to the sklyanin ones .",
    "let us re - examine some facts about bi - hamiltonian systems .",
    "we recall some definitions .",
    "let @xmath28 be a differentiable manifold , @xmath29 and @xmath30 its tangent and cotangent bundle .",
    "at any point @xmath31 the tangent and cotangent spaces are denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the pairing between them is given by the map @xmath34 @xmath35 for each smooth function @xmath36 @xmath37 denotes the differential of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath28 is said to be a poisson manifold if it is endowed with a poisson bracket @xmath39 @xmath40 in general degenerate .",
    "the related poisson tensor @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 .",
    "so , at each point @xmath43 is a linear map @xmath44 which is skew - symmetric and fulfils the jacobi identity .",
    "any function @xmath45 such that @xmath46 is called a casimir of @xmath47 let @xmath48,@xmath49 be two poisson tensors on @xmath50 a vector field @xmath51 is said to be a bi - hamiltonian with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath52 if there exist two smooth functions @xmath53,@xmath54 such that @xmath55 poisson tensors @xmath48 and @xmath52 are said to be compatible if the associated pencil @xmath56 is itself a poisson tensor for any @xmath57 moreover , if @xmath48 is invertible , the tensor @xmath58 , called a recursion operator , is a nijenhuis ( hereditary ) tensor of such a property that when it acts on a given bi - hamiltonian vector field @xmath51 , it produces another bi - hamiltonian vector field being a symmetry generator of @xmath51 .",
    "hence , having the invariant nijenhuis tensor , one can construct a hierarchy of hamiltonian symmetries and related hierarchy of constants of motion for an underlying system , so important for its integrability .",
    "unfortunately , for majority of bi - hamiltonian finite dimensional systems , both poisson structures are degenerate , so one can not construct the recursion nijenhuis tensor inverting one of the poisson structures .",
    "nevertheless , due to the nonuniqueness of hamiltonian functions , determined up to an appropriate casimir function , it is always possible to construct a finite bi - hamiltonian chain starting and terminating with casimirs of @xmath59 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "let us consider a poisson manifold @xmath28 of @xmath60 equipped with a linear poisson pencil @xmath61 of maximal rank , where @xmath48 and @xmath52 are compatible poisson structures and @xmath62 is a continuous parameter . as was first shown by gelfand and zakharevich @xcite ,",
    "a casimir of the pencil is a polynomial in @xmath62 of an order @xmath3 @xmath63 and generates a bi - hamiltonian chain @xmath64 where @xmath65and @xmath66 in the paper we restrict our considerations to a class of canonical coordinates @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 are generalized coordinates and @xmath70 is a casimir coordinate .",
    "hence , @xmath48 always stays a canonical poisson matrix .",
    "this restriction simplifies the theory in the sense that it makes a marsden - ratiu projection procedure @xcite , @xcite trivial .      to understand the theory better ,",
    "let us start from the end in some sense , i.e. from a system written in separated coordinates @xmath71 an interesting observation is that such a system can be represented by @xmath3 different points of some curve .",
    "we start from gelfand and zakharevich case .",
    "actually , let us consider a curve in @xmath72 plane , in the particular form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an arbitrary smooth function .",
    "then , let us take @xmath3 different points @xmath9 from the curve : @xmath75 which will define our separated coordinates as they are of the form ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the explicit dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath77 is given by the solution of @xmath3 linear equations ( [ 15 ] ) , while for fixed values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 the system ( [ 15 ] ) allows us to solve the appropriate hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "here , we have to mention that the idea to relate the multi - hamiltonian property to an @xmath80-parameter family of curves comes from p. vanhaecke @xcite.@xmath81    in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the bi - hamiltonian chain was constructed for a _ separation curve _ in the form ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "actually , the hamiltonian functions @xmath76 found from the system ( [ 15 ] ) take the following compact form @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the so - called viete polynomials ( symmetric polynomials ) and @xmath84 for example , for @xmath85 we have @xmath86 and for @xmath87@xmath88 the bi - hamiltonian chain ( [ 13 ] ) is constructed with respect to the following compatible poisson matrix @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 notice that the last column of @xmath52 is just the first vector field @xmath92 all hamiltonians @xmath76 are in involution with respect to both poisson structures @xmath48 and @xmath52 .    applying the following important relations @xmath93 and the decomposition ( [ 6 ] ) , the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath94 turn into the form @xmath95}{\\delta _",

    "now , let us pass to the projection of the poisson pencil @xmath97 onto a symplectic leaf @xmath98 of @xmath48 ( @xmath99 ) fixing the value of @xmath70 .",
    "generally , one has to apply the marsden - ratiu theorem which in this case is trivial , as obviously @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a nondegenerate poisson pencil on @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the related nijenhuis tensor @xmath102 is diagonal and this is the reason why we will refer below to the separated coordinates as to the darboux - nijenhuis ( dn ) coordinates .",
    "notice that @xmath103 ( [ 18 ] ) are coefficients of minimal polynomial of the nijenhuis tensor @xmath104 on @xmath98 the chain ( [ 13 ] ) turns into the form @xmath105 the last equation terminates the sequence of vector fields @xmath106 in the hierarchy as for the next equation from the chain we have @xmath107 obviously @xmath108 is not a recursion operator for the hierarchy ( [ 27 ] ) . because of the form of the first equation , the vector field @xmath109 is called a quasi - bi - hamiltonian @xcite-@xcite and the chain ( [ 27 ] ) could be treated alternatively as a starting point of the separability theory for the case of @xmath110 .",
    "now , let us consider an arbitrary canonical transformation @xmath111 independent of a casimir coordinate @xmath70 ( not necessarily a point transformation ! ) .",
    "the advantage of staying inside such a class of transformations is that the clear structure of a pencil is preserved and the marsden - ratiu projection of the poisson pencil is still trivial .",
    "of course , the most general case of multi - hamiltonian separability theory takes place when one goes beyond the set of canonical coordinates .",
    "i.e. when one tries to find dn coordinates starting from the pencil written in a non - canonical representation .",
    "but then the simple structure of degenerated poisson pencil is lost and the nontrivial problem of the marsden - ratiu projection for such pencil appears ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    applying the transformation ( [ 29 ] ) to hamiltonian functions ( [ 16 ] ) and poisson matrices ( [ 20 ] ) one finds that @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are @xmath116 matrices .",
    "the nondegenerate poisson pencil @xmath117 on @xmath98 gives rise to the related nijenhuis tensor @xmath108 and its adjoint @xmath118 in @xmath119 coordinates in the form @xmath120    obviously , in a real situation we start from a given bi - hamiltonian chain ( [ 30])-([33 ] ) in canonical coordinates @xmath67 derived by some method ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) , and trying to find the dn coordinates which diagonalize the appropriate nijenhuis tensor and are separated coordinates for the considered system .",
    "so now we pass to a systematic derivation of the inverse of transformation ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "the important intermediate step of the construction of dn coordinates are the so called hankel - frbenious ( hf ) non - canonical coordinates @xmath121 @xcite , @xcite , related to the dn ones through the following transformation @xmath122 in @xmath121 coordinates one finds @xmath123 moreover the differentials @xmath124 satisfy the following recursion relations @xcite , @xcite @xmath125   n^{*}\\circ dv_1 & = & dv_2-u_1dv_1 , \\\\   n^{*}\\circ dv_2 & = & dv_3-u_2dv_1 , \\\\   & \\vdots &   \\\\   n^{*}\\circ dv_{n-1 } & = & dv_n - u_{n-1}dv_1 , \\\\   n^{*}\\circ dv_n & = & -u_ndv_1 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] note that vector fields @xmath126 and @xmath127 are quasi - bi - hamiltonian .",
    "now we relate the canonical coordinates @xmath128 to the dn separated coordinates @xmath129 . from the minimal polynomial of @xmath130 ( [ 33 ] ) we get @xmath131 conjugate coordinates @xmath132 are found from the recursion formula ( [ 35 ] ) while @xmath133 coordinate from relations @xmath134 hence we get @xmath135 eliminating @xmath121 coordinates from ( [ 34 ] ) , ( [ 36 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) we derive the desired relations @xmath136    now let us concentrate on a special but important case of point transformation between @xmath128 and @xmath129 variables .",
