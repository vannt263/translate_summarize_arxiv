    "string tachyon fields @xmath0 are the lowest energy state in unstable dp - brane or brane - antibrane systems .",
    "since they represent the low energy limit of string - brane models the phenomenology of the tachyon field is important and a great amount of work has been invested in studying the dynamics of tachyon field , . in the case of a dp - brane systems in string theory , the potential @xmath1 has been conjectured to be tachyonic at the origin @xmath10 , i.e. the potential has a maximum at the origin with a negative mass square , @xmath11 .",
    "the tachyon field has a dirac - born - infeld type lagrangian and therefore it does not have canonical kinetic terms .",
    "this implies that the naive prescription for the mass of tachyon as the @xmath12 does not hold in this case nor can we assume that the evolution of @xmath0 is to reach the minimum of the potential @xmath1 , as for a standard scalar field , since @xmath1 does not correspond to the true potential for @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the tachyon field has an equation of state parameter @xmath13 . for string motivated potentials , e.g. @xmath14 ,",
    "the late time behavior gives @xmath15 and @xmath0 behaves as matter .",
    "this is the `` matter problem '' because @xmath0 can easily dominate the universe well before radiation - matter equality since it redshifts slower than radiation .",
    "so , if @xmath0 is present at early times it should necessarily decay into other particles to avoid the matter problem .    in this letter we study the generic cosmological evolution of a scalar field @xmath0 with a dirac - born - infeld type lagrangian coupled to a canonical scalar field through an arbitrary interaction term @xmath3 in the presence a barotropic fluid , which can be matter or radiation .",
    "we will call the field @xmath0 as the tachyon field even though we do not constrain ourselves to a potential @xmath1 with @xmath16 at the origin , so our results are valid for any potential @xmath1 .",
    "we show that all models dependence is given in terms of three parameters @xmath17 and @xmath6 .",
    "we determine the dynamical equations and obtain the attractor solutions as a function of these @xmath7 parameters .",
    "we show in this _",
    "letter _ that it is possible for a tachyon field to redshift as matter in the absence of an interaction term @xmath9 and to redshift at late times as radiation due to the interaction term .",
    "therefore , the interaction term solves the tachyonic matter problem .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in section",
