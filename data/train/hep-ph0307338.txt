    "in spite of a huge experimental effort , the higgs particle , the last missing ingredient of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has not been yet discovered . for a higgs - boson mass @xmath4",
    "the most promising production channel at lep2 is through radiation off a @xmath5-boson : @xmath6 ; using this reaction the lep experiments obtained the limit  @xcite @xmath7 on the sm higgs - boson mass .",
    "the higgs particle also contributes radiatively to several well measured quantities , which has been used to derive the complementary upper bound  @xcite @xmath8 at 95 %  c.l .. the data then leave a rather narrow range for @xmath0 , however it must be emphasized that these constraints are highly model - dependent and are significantly weakened in most extensions of the sm .",
    "there also exist theoretical , restrictions of @xmath0 based on the so - called triviality and vacuum stability arguments . as it is well know  @xcite the renormalized @xmath9 theory can not contain an interaction term ( @xmath10 ) for any non - zero scalar mass : the theory must be trivial . within a perturbative approach the statement corresponds to the fact that for any non - zero scalar mass   this condition corresponds to a non - vanishing initial value for the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of @xmath11 .",
    "] there exists a finite energy scale at which @xmath11 diverges ( the landau pole ) .",
    "consequently this theory is consistent for all energy scales only when it describes non - interacting scalars .",
    "an analogous effect occurs in the scalar sector of the sm , though modified to some extent by presence of gauge and yukawa interactions .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply a trivial scalar sector , since we do not demand the validity of the sm at arbitrarily high energy scales .",
    "for example , it is often assumed that the sm represents the low energy limit of some underlying more fundamental theory whose heavy excitations decouple at low energy , but become manifest at a scale @xmath2 . within this scenario",
    "the sm is an effective theory containing the dominant terms in a @xmath12 expansion ; any process occurring at a typical energy @xmath13 will then receive corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath14 generated by the sub - leading interactions .",
    "if the sm is to be accurate for energies below @xmath15 the landau pole should occur at scale @xmath15 or above , and this condition gives a ( @xmath2-dependent ) upper bound on @xmath16  @xcite . on the other hand , for sufficiently small @xmath16 radiative corrections can destabilize the ground state .",
    "this occurs if the running scalar self - coupling constant @xmath17 becomes negative at some scale , that can be again identified with the scale of new physics @xmath2 . alternatively requiring the sm vacuum to be stable for scales below @xmath18 implies a ( @xmath2-dependent ) lower bound on @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the above arguments ( triviality and vacuum stability ) are usually discussed assuming pure sm interactions . however ,",
    "if the scale of new physics is sufficiently low ( of the order of a few tev ) one would expect for the sub - dominant effects to significantly influence both the renormalization group evolution and the scalar effective potential , and thus modify the corresponding bounds on the higgs - boson mass .",
    "it then becomes interesting to determine the manner in which heavy physics with scales in the @xmath19 region can modify the stability and triviality bounds on the higgs - boson mass . in this paper",
    "we address this question in a model - independent way by parameterizing the heavy physics effects using an effective lagrangian satisfying the sm gauge symmetries .",
    "this issue was investigated in previous publications  @xcite , but without taking into account the restrictions generated by the precision tests of the sm . the analysis presented here remedies this deficiency by including these constraints ( to the one - loop approximation in the sm and at tree level in the effective dim  6 operators ) ; for other works discussing vacuum stability including some effective operators see refs .",

    "our study of the stability and triviality constraints on the higgs - boson mass will be based on the sm lagrangian modified by the addition of a series of effective operators whose coefficients parameterize the low - energy effects of the heavy physics  @xcite . assuming that these non - standard effects decouple implies  @xcite that all physical effects disappear in the @xmath20 limit and ,",
    "in particular , that the effective operators of dimension @xmath21 appear multiplied by appropriate inverse powers of @xmath15 .",
    "leading effects are then generated by operators of mass - dimension 6 ( dimension 5 operators necessarily violate lepton number  @xcite and are presumably associated with new physics at very large scales since they lead to very small effects ; accordingly they can be safely ignored hereafter ) . given our emphasis on higgs - boson physics the effects of all fermions excepting the top - quark",

    "hereafter we will consider the rg improved effective potential @xmath85 that includes all these effects .",
    "in considering stability and triviality limits we studied models characterized by having @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath32 at @xmath88 consistent with a choice of @xmath89 and @xmath18 and with the experimental values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( the relative strength of neutral and charged currents ) . for this we used the expressions",

    "taking then the experimental values and uncertainties we constructed the combined @xmath96 function for these 4 observables   and @xmath65 are smaller than the theoretical counterparts within the 1-loop approximation , we used 1%  ( theoretical ) error for the correpsonding contributions to @xmath96 . ] . if @xmath97 was obtained , then the initial values of @xmath94 and @xmath32 were adjusted until the results yielded @xmath98 .",
    "once this was achieved the solution was deemed consistent with the precision measurements and was used to determine the triviality and stability conditions given the choices of @xmath99 and @xmath15 .",
    "we found that the above procedure for determining @xmath94 and @xmath32 at @xmath88 failed only when @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that these cases are already disallowed by the triviality constraints ( see below ) .",

    "we do not allow @xmath55 to reach @xmath15 since the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) is valid only below this scale ; the specific choice of @xmath109 is arbitrary and the results are not sensitive to it .",
    "t1 and t2 are standard triviality conditions insuring that the coupling constants remain small enough for perturbation theory to remain valid .",
    "the condition t3 contains three parts : t3a , t3b and t3c that ensure that corrections from 6-dim operators remain small .",
    "t3a guarantees that the non - standard corrections to the sm @xmath49-functions are below 25% level ( and is satisfied if t2 is fulfiled ) .",
    "t3b keeps the @xmath110 effective contribution to the tree level potential ( [ tree_pot ] ) small ( @xmath11125% ) in comparison to the sm @xmath9 quartic term .",
    "lastly , t3c , requires for the effective operator corrections to the higgs boson to be below 25% ( see eq .",
    "[ ht_mass ] ) .",
    "t3 then implement the condition that the leading @xmath112 effects remain small compared to the sm contributions .    the vacuum stability requirement is implemented by the following 2 conditions :    1 .   for @xmath113",

    "s1 implements the condition that the underlying theory is weakly coupled while s2 insures that the minimum at @xmath118 is stable for all field strengths below @xmath119 .      , and the lower ( red ) ones for @xmath120 .",

    "for @xmath124 the corresponding term decreases the value of @xmath78 at @xmath125 and a _ larger _ value of @xmath17 is required to stabilize the minimum at @xmath126 ( thereby insuring condition s2 is satisfied ) . in this case we then obtain that the vacuum stability constraints are satisfied for values of @xmath0 larger than those obtained in the pure sm ( for the same choice of @xmath18 ) .    when @xmath127 the effect of the corresponding term in (    [ tree_pot ] ) tends to stabilize the minimum at @xmath128 , but it also shifts it away from the tree - level sm value .",
    "_ therefore in this case @xmath0 is not limited by the stability of @xmath128 but by the requirement that its value is near the electroweak scale _ ( condition s1 ) .",

    "the black middle curve describes the sm limit , while the non - standard bounds consist of 4 tight groups of 16 curves each : the two upper ( green ) curves provide the limit for @xmath130 while the lower ( red ) ones for @xmath131 .",
    "the graphs show that @xmath132 tends to destabilize the electroweak vacuum , and that the limits obtained for fixed @xmath133 and @xmath134 are almost independent of the signs of the other @xmath93 ( their influence is illustrated by the width of the curves ) .    in spite of the complicated nature of the analysis performed here , it is worth to trace the way in which @xmath135 could influence the lower limit on the higgs - boson mass .",
    "the key point is the fact that @xmath136 modify the relation ( [ ht_mass ] ) between the top - quark mass and its yukawa coupling . expressing the yukawa coupling @xmath137 through @xmath138 one obtains the following form of the fermionic contribution , @xmath139 , to the effective potential ( [ effpot ] ) : t=()^2 ^ 2 .",
    "[ t ] since the instability ( where the effective potential is bending down ) takes place for @xmath140 therefore effectively we obtain substantial enhancement or suppression ( depending on the sign of @xmath135 ) factor of top - quark contribution .",
    "another mechanism of enhancing the contribution from @xmath136 is the very large numerical factor in front of @xmath135 in the evolution equation of @xmath123 .",
    "because of this a larger @xmath135 drives @xmath123 to larger values thereby again requiring a larger @xmath0 .",
    "both effects combine leading to the dependence on @xmath135 illustrated in fig.[stab - only - plot ] .",

    "this scenario allows for a higgs boson mass below the sm stability limit , and if this happens to be the case experimentally , the result would not only indicate the presence of new physics , but would also suggest the type of new physics _ and _ provide an upper bound on its scale .",

    "we include in this plot the sm result together with the 64 curves obtained by taking @xmath143 .",
    "it is seen that all 65 lines are nearly identical illustrating the fact that the sm upper limit stay approximately unchanged in presence of the effective operators .    to qualitatively understand this lack of sensitivity it is useful to consider the special case where @xmath144 . in this case",

    "the fact that @xmath167 region ( green ) or @xmath168 region ( blue ) appears always adjoint to the lower edge ( where @xmath11 is relatively small ) is also easy to understand , for in this case t3 is stronger , and therefore easier to violate .",
    "note that there exist models ( e.g. the model a ) such that either of the    requirements t2 and t3 exclude the whole region between the sm - like upper limit ( @xmath169 ) and the lower ( stability ) bound , which is due to large contributions to the @xmath49-functions , the tree - level potential and to the higgs - boson mass from the effective operators .",
    "this illustrates the importance of conditions t2 and t3 that can completely eliminate certain models , and severly limt the allowed values of @xmath18 and @xmath89 in others .",

    "note for instance the difference between plots corresponding to models a and c for which @xmath123 and @xmath135 are identical .",

    "[ models - plot ] labeled @xmath154 are no longer forbidden .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the actual strength of the triviality conditions t1 , t2 and t3 is to certain extent arbitrary ( _ e.g _ we could demand deviations below 20%  insted of the 25%we used ) , and therefore shape of the allowed regions showed in fig.[models - plot ] could be slightly modified if other conditions were specified .",
    "we have considered restrictions on the higgs - boson mass that emerge form requirement of perturbative behavior of coupling constants ( the triviality bound ) and from the condition of stable electroweak vacuum , taking into account possible non - standard interactions ( of a typical scale @xmath2 ) described by effective operators of dimension @xmath170 .",
    "the allowed regions in the ( @xmath3 ) space resulting from the stability and triviality requirements has been determined and discussed in detail , taking into account all the necessary constraints from precision tests of the standard model .",
    "it was shown that for the scale of new physics in the region @xmath171 the standard model triviality upper bound ( defined as an upper limit for the quartic coupling constant @xmath11 ) remains unchanged , whereas the lower bound from the requirement of vacuum stability could be substantially modified , depending on values of the coefficients of two dim  6 operators : @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "a natural generalization of the triviality condition leads also to a substantial reduction of the allowed region in the ( @xmath3 ) space .",
    "all the above considerations are applicable for the case where the heavy physics is weakly coupled and decoupling , and has a particle content that naturally generates the various operators considered , especially @xmath174 and @xmath175",
    ". however , there are models where these operators are not generated   appears at tree - level only in models containing heavy scalars of isospin @xmath176 ; @xmath177 appears at tree - level only if the model contains a combination of heavy fermions and scalars of isospin @xmath178 . ] in which case the stability and triviality bounds relax to those of the sm .",
    "finally we would like to mention that several discrepancies between the results presented here and those of  @xcite .",
    "this is due to a series of typographical errors in  @xcite : the signs of the @xmath60 in the lagrangian and effective potential ( equations 1,3 and 5 of that reference ) should be changed .",
    "then the sign convention for @xmath35 used in the present paper is _ opposite _ to the one used in  @xcite ; correspondingly the sign of @xmath179 induced in a 2-higgs doublet model is positive .",
    "in addition the triviality graph presented in  @xcite refers only to the usual sm condition , labeled t1 above ; the claims made in  @xcite concerning the requirement t2 are incorrect .",

    "the issue of the vacuum stability in presence of non - standard physics has been recently addressed by the authors of ref .",
    "they conjectured that if the ground state of the underlying theory has flat directions ( no quartic interactions for certain field configurations ) , then the effective theory will be non - polynomial and an expansion in powers of light fields is not justified",
    ". however , in the absence of fine tuning there will be no flat directions , and these complications do not arise .",
    "this is the situation considered in the present paper where the effective potential is by its construction polynomial in light degrees of freedom .    as an illustration of their statement the authors of  @xcite",
    "provide an model containing two real scalar fields , @xmath22 and @xmath180 , with the following potential v(,)=-12m^2 ^ 2 + 18 ^ 4 + 12m^2 ^ 2 + ^3+^2 ^ 2  .",

    "[ positivity ]    on the other hand in the effective theory obtained by integrating out the heavy field @xmath180 one obtains the following low - energy potential : v()=-12m^2 ^ 2 + 18 ^ 4 - 12 ^ 2 ^ 6m^2 + 2 ^ 2 .",
    "[ effpot - exa ] the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite then claim that expanding in powers of @xmath185 leads to the result that the potential ( [ effpot - exa ] ) is unstable for parameters that at the same time satisfy the positivity constraints ( [ positivity ] ) for the underlying theory ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "their conclusion is then that stability requirements obtained using the low - energy effective theory are inaccurate and can generate much stronger bounds than those obtained using the full lagrangian .    in order to investigate the effective lagrangian derived from ( [ effpot - exa ] ) we note that the large @xmath186 expansion is justified provided @xmath187 . adopting this restriction",
    ", one can easily find that the effective theory is stable when 2 [ ours ] .",
    "we thus reproduce the second stability condition in ( [ positivity ] ) ; it is clear , however , that to the lowest order in @xmath188 we can not recover the constraint @xmath189 .",
    "this is so because ( [ ours ] ) is the result of physics at or below the cutoff @xmath190 .",
    "in contrast , the condition on @xmath191 results from of some physics ( or fine tuning ) above the cutoff , and can not be obtained using the effective theory .",
    "it should also be emphasized here that the effective lagrangian approach presupposes that all terms allowed by the symmetries of the model are present in the original lagrangian , which is not the case for ( [ pot ] ) ; accordingly , the constraint on @xmath55 is significantly modified if we allow a term @xmath192 .",
    "though one can not draw any general conclusions experimenting with a fine tuned potential such as ( [ pot ] ) , this example does provide a useful illustration of the implications of the naturality assumption in effective theories .",
