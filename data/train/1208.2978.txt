    "first of all , we have chosen the lowest - dimensional orthosymplectic algebra @xmath47 to start with . in the previous paragraph we talked about extending quantum mechanics without sacrificing any of its properties .",

    "[ def : liesuperalgebras ] .",
    "it contains only even supermatrices as we prove in the next lemma .",
    "note that sometimes @xmath17 is defined as @xmath48 subject to @xmath49  @xcite where the elements of @xmath50 are already by definition even supermatrices .",
    "here we show that one can start with an arbitrary ` grassmannified ' element of @xmath47 given by the above definition  @xcite and it is the super self - adjoint constraint @xmath49 that singles out even supermatrices .",
    "another important ( and perhaps surprising ) consequence of @xmath49 is that the order of the standard basis eq .",
    "( [ eq : freebasis ] ) for the underlying @xmath51-graded vector space has been reversed with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "let s illustrate it on the odd generators of the @xmath47 algebra .",

    "( [ eq : freebasis ] ) for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , they are reresented by the following matrices  @xcite : @xmath54 on the other hand , the @xmath17 algebra has a bosonic ( even ) subalgebra that happens to be the @xmath55 algebra occupying a two - dimensional subspace spanned by ( two ) even basis vectors .",
    "so in reality we should write @xmath56 instead of @xmath17 .",
    "we wo nt do that to keep the notation consistent with the majority of literature but to be able to consistently use the supermatrix operations and rules as presented in appendix  [ sec : appbackground ] ( recall that the supertranspose depends on the standard basis order ) , we have to work with the generators of @xmath17 written in the standard basis .",
    "the odd generators @xmath17 happen to be the same as those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ospoddgens ] ) and that implies to shift the basis order and redefine the odd generators as    [ eq : uospoddgens ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 we will label them @xmath59 as well .",

    "[ lem : evenmatrices ] the elements of @xmath17 are even supermatrices .    the lie superalgebra @xmath47 has five generators . following def .",

    "as we have already mentioned  @xcite , the @xmath17 algebra is not a lie superalgebra but something closer to an ordinary lie algebra due to the presence of grassmann numbers .",
    "the main purpose for considering even supermatrices such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : uosparbitraryelement ] ) is that unlike the case of lie superalgebras , there exists an exponential map transforming this grassmann number - assisted lie algebra into the corresponding lie group  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , there is an equivalent of the zassenhaus formula for even supermatrices but not for orthosymplectic lie superalgebras due to the presence of the anticommutator for odd elements of @xmath82  @xcite .",

    "a self - adjoint generator of the @xmath88 lie algebra becomes a unitary matrix representing an element of the corresponding group @xmath89 .",

    "<S> an important tool in these investigations is a hypothetical resource called a nonlocal box also proposed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a superquantum resource performing strictly better than quantum mechanics while still respecting the no - signalling condition . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal boxes rule over the whole gap in a sense that their decohered version can approximate any theory between quantum mechanics and the no - signalling world . </S>",
    "<S> they are , however , purely mathematical constructs with no links to even hypothetical physical theories .    </S>",
    "<S> the object of study in this work is called a superqubit . </S>",
    "<S> it was first introduced in  @xcite and its role in the chsh game was investigated for the first time in  @xcite . put simply , superqubits are the minimal supersymmetric extension of qubits where the main role is played by the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra over the reals @xmath0 ( more precisely , one of its real forms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 algebra has been extensively studied in the past  @xcite as one of the most important example of a lie superalgebras  @xcite . on the physical side , </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation for studying supersymmetry comes from high energy physics where it is the leading candidate for physics beyond standard model . </S>",
    "<S> it is nonetheless important to stress that the lie superalgebra and the derived structures studied in this paper are not directly related to any hypothetical superpartner . despite of this </S>",
    "<S> , there are at least three reasons why it is an interesting problem to study . </S>",
    "<S> first , there exists at least two proposals from condensed matter physics where supersymmetry , in particular the family of orthosymplectic lie superalgebras @xmath1 , plays a key role  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the developed methods and concepts can be eventually used for higher - dimensional lie superalgebras that are relevant to supersymmetry - based high - energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , if we ignore the question of direct physical relevance , it is an exciting quest to create a _ </S>",
    "<S> synthetic _ quantum theory that contains ordinary quantum mechanics and non - trivially extends it at the same time .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of  @xcite suggests that the supersymmetric extension of quantum mechanics based on superqubits may be a candidate for a superquantum theory that lies in the gap between ordinary quantum theory and pr boxes . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the violation of tsirelson s bound reported there . </S>",
    "<S> an unfortunate consequence is the presence of negative transition probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> they never appear in the actual calculation leading to the result but one would like to avoid them entirely . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a solution to this problem for single superqubits . </S>",
    "<S> the same issue in the case of multi - superqubit states remains open and is likely to be resolved in the context of a larger lie supergroup .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper has a multiple purpose : ( i ) to anchor the notion of superqubits on a firm mathematical footing that has its roots in the theory of lie superalgebras and related structures , ( ii ) to systematically develop the rules for calculating with superqubits in the same way quantum information theorists deal with qubits and , ( iii ) to offer a solution to the problem of occurrence of negative probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this is an issue first encountered in  @xcite and we offer a partial solution by means of compactification of the superqubit space . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the problem of negative probabilities disappears for single superqubits . </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence is that we violate tsirelson s bound less ( @xmath2 ) than reported in  @xcite . from other results </S>",
    "<S> it is worth of mentioning that we have introduced a super hilbert space on the vector subspace of the supermatrix space @xmath3 together with formalizing the notions of a ( super)ket and bra based on superlinear algebra . </S>",
    "<S> the supermatrix formalism enables us to easy manipulate and calculate with superqubits .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two main sections and two appendices in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : squbits ] introduces superqubits in a manner different from the original article  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it attempts to introduce some additional , perhaps less known or novel , details about the used superstructures in order to formalize the notion of a superqubit from the mathematical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> it heavily relies on the definitions and terminology of supermathematics summarized and reviewed in appendix  [ sec : appbackground ] . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : chsh ] focuses more on the physical consequences of the developed formalism and we investigate the performance of bipartite superqubit states in the chsh game . </S>",
    "<S> appendix  [ sec : appslinearalg ] brings detailed calculations of some results in section  [ sec : squbits ] based on superlinear algebra whose theory is outlined in appendix  [ sec : appbackground ] . </S>",
    "<S> the paper concludes with a number of open questions . </S>"
