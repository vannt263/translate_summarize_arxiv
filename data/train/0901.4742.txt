    "trapped ion quantum computing is a rapidly progressing and developing area of experimental and theoretical research  @xcite .",
    "all basic building blocks of a quantum information processor based on trapped ions have been demonstrated : qubit initialization , typically via optical pumping ; qubit state manipulation by rf  @xcite or optical  @xcite fields ; qubit state readout by quantum jumps  @xcite .",
    "fundamental quantum logic gates  @xcite and multi - qubit entanglement  @xcite have also been demonstrated . in this paper",
    "we address the issue of qubit state readout which is typically based on the ion bright / dark state discrimination .",
    "efficient ion fluorescence collection is critical for fast , reliable qubit state detection required not only at the end of any quantum computation , but throughout the computation process to enable quantum error correction  @xcite .",
    "additionally , higher photon collection rates from single trapped ions or atoms would lead to more efficient single - photon sources and ion - photon entanglement  @xcite .",
    "ion fluorescence collection is commonly performed using reasonably high - n.a .",
    "refractive optics , achieving a collection efficiency of a few percent .",
    "a major practical limitation in using this type of optics is the large working distance , of order of a few cm , due to the fact that the lens is located outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "high - n.a .",
    "optics in this case becomes a very expensive , custom job .",
    "some efforts have been made to place the lens inside the vacuum apparatus , closer to the ion trap  @xcite to achieve up to about 5% light collection efficiency .",
    "another approach is to use reflective optics such as an optical cavity , or a single spherical or parabolic mirror . a small ( order of 100 @xmath0 m )",
    ", high - finesse optical cavity similar to those used in cavity qed experiments  @xcite appears to be the ultimate solution .",
    "many serious efforts are under way to couple trapped ions to a high - finesse cavity  @xcite and rapid progress is being made .",
    "however , the presence of dielectric cavity mirrors in the close vicinity of the trapped ions may be detrimental to the ion trapping process .",
    "a parabolic mirror surrounding the ion trap is a attractive alternative  @xcite .",
    "it would provide excellent performance in terms of image quality .",
    "however , making a high - n.a .",
    "parabolic mirror itself is quite a demanding task .",
    "our simulations of a parabolic mirror show that it is also sensitive to ion s alignment with respect to the focus of the mirror .",
    "a spherical mirror , due to its high symmetry , is much less sensitive to such misalignment .",
    "a spherical mirror placed in vacuum with ions in the center of the mirror curvature has been used to double the photon count on a large area photomultiplier tube  @xcite , but was not used for imaging . here",
    "we present an ion imaging system based on 0.9 n.a .",
    "spherical mirror which is in principle capable of collecting up to about 28% of light emitted by the ion . to improve the image quality which suffers greatly from strong spherical aberration introduced by the high - n.a .",
    "mirror we designed an aspherical corrector lens based on the widely used schmidt telescope corrector element .",
    "our simulations show that with this corrector the ion image is suitable not only for high - quality imaging and photon counting , but possibly even for fiber - coupling single ion fluorescence .",
    "to model the ion trap behavior in the presence of a spherical mirror we used the method of images  @xcite .",
    "we compared the trapped ion orbit in an unperturbed quadrupole electric field produced by the four rf electrodes of our linear trap , described in much detail in the following section , to the ion motion in the presence of a grounded metallic symmetry plane nearby , which is a simplified model of the spherical metallic mirror .",
    "our simulations show that the ion orbit is perturbed by less than 1  @xmath0 m if the plane is farther than 5  mm away .",
    "this displacement of the trapping center is negligible and , if necessary , can be easily corrected by applying a small bias voltage to the top rf electrodes .",
    "figure  1 shows the calculated orbit displacement of a trapped ion in the trap in the presence of a spherical mirror .        due to restrictions imposed by our ion trap construction , the size of the reflective surface",
    "is limited to 20@xmath120  mm@xmath2 . to achieve the highest numerical aperture ,",
    "the mirror should stay as close as possible to the trapping center .",
    "several considerations prevent it from being too close : the mirror should not block the cooling laser access arranged at right angle to the mirror axis ; and the entirety of the mirror surface should be shielded from the atomic barium beam to avoid coating .",
    "additionally , it should not significantly affect the trap stability as discussed above .",
    "we found a suitable spherical mirror with focal length of 10  mm in edmund optics catalog ( stock no .",
    "nt43 - 464 ) and set out to model its performance .      using an aspheric plate to correct the aberration of the image by a spherical mirror",
    "was invented by bernhard schmidt in 1930 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the concept is to distort the collimated light beam before it hits the mirror to cancel most of the spherical aberration in reflection .",
    "this is achieved by adding a piece of optics through which the spherical mirror looks like a parabolic mirror .",
    "it is widely used in telescopes and reflective camera lenses .",
    "to lowest order , the general corrector curve equation can be expressed as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thickness of the corrector , @xmath5 is the distance from the optical axis , @xmath6 is the radius of curvature of the spherical mirror , and @xmath7 is the refractive index of the corrector material .",
    "@xmath8 is a constant determined by the corrector plate s position with respect to the mirror , which is normally within @xmath6 . in our situation , the problem is reversed : we are attempting to create a collimated beam of light emitted by a point source ( the ion ) reflected from a spherical mirror .",
    "an additional restriction is that the viewport is about 17  mm away from the mirror focus , so @xmath8 should be equal to 0 , corresponding to a plate at the center of the mirror curvature . through this general formula",
    ", we arrive at a fourth - order curve equation for our specific parameters ( using standard bk7 glass ) : @xmath9 this curve is plotted in figure  2(a ) as the black solid line",
    ". however , the 4@xmath10-order curve works well only for small n.a . mirrors . in our case , higher order terms ( and higher order aberrations , and aberrations due to the planar viewport ) would have to be taken into account to determine the optimal corrector shape .",
    "for typical systems such as a reflective telescope or a schmidt camera , better performance can be achieved by adding a small lens between the focus and the mirror , but this would not work for us since the refractive optics placed too close to the trap would destabilize the ion by patch charging .     of various corrector plate shapes plotted vs. distance @xmath5 from the optical axis : the schmidt corrector ( black ) , the numerical model curve ( red ) and the 10@xmath10 order polynomial fit to the numerical result ( green ) .",
    "( b ) deviations of various types of polynomial fits from the exact numerical model . ]    as an alternative , we tried a brute - force approach by directly calculating the best correcting element shape for our specific set up .",
    "the principle is quite simple : ensure that any ray originating from the ion and reflected off the mirror is parallel to the optical axis .",
    "another option would be to make the deflected ray slope proportional to its distance from the main optical axis .",
    "we are not attempting to derive a general solution here , rather the one ideal for our application .",
    "we used wolfram research , inc .",
    "mathematica to numerically perform the ray tracing and curve fitting .",
    "because of the rotational symmetry , the problem can be reduced to two dimensions .",
    "the slopes of the ray span are recursively calculated at the curve vertex @xmath4-value and then integrated and expressed as a function of @xmath5 , the distance from the optical axis .",
    "the deviation from the vertex is added to the thickness of the corrector plate for the next round of calculation .",
    "the curve equation converged quickly and the difference was smaller than a quarter of the wavelength after only 10 iterations .",
    "again , the standard bk7 glass was used in the simulation .",
    "this numerical simulation predicted an irregular curve shown in figure  2(a ) as a red line .",
    "we used the optics modeling software ( sinclair optics , inc .",
    "oslo  lt ) to evaluate the performance of such a corrector element .",
    "since oslo  lt only supports polynomials up to order 10 for its surface data input , it was impossible to exactly reproduce the shape of the corrector in the simulation .",
    "instead , we fit the corrector shape profile with even , odd and full 10@xmath10 order polynomials ; they differ by as much as 20@xmath0 m ( about 40 times the wavelength at 493  nm ) from the numerically derived shape .",
    "the even - order polynomial fit is very good close to the optical axis but gets much worse than the full 10@xmath10 order polynomials fit in off - axis region .",
    "the odd - order polynomial has the worst fit overall .",
    "the all - order polynomial fit is plotted in figure  2(a ) in green , and the deviations of the three types of fits from the numerical model are plotted in figure  2(b ) .",
    "surprisingly , all of the fits perform much better than the equation  2 curve in correcting the spherical aberration .",
    "we estimated the corrector s performance by modeling how well the collimated beam it produces is focused by an infinity - corrected microscope objective  @xcite ( figure  3(a ) ) .",
    "as shown in figure  3 ( b ) , both the even- and full - order curves gave a root mean square spot size of 67  @xmath0 m , about 1/3 the spot size produced by the 4@xmath10 order curve in equation  2 .",
    "with some basic spatial filtering techniques , any background from light scattered from other surfaces and other sources can be largely suppressed so that a pmt can be used for high - speed , accurate photon detections with low noise .",
    "if the actual numerically - derived corrector shape is used rather than a fit , we believe the performance should be close to that of a perfect parabolic mirror , and nearly diffraction - limited imaging and single - mode fiber coupling should be possible . off axis displacement",
    "up to 100@xmath0 m will increase the spot size by less than 5% , which makes it possible to resolve a string of tens of ions 5 to 10 @xmath0 m apart .",
    "to test the spherical mirror performance we upgraded our existing `` 5-rod '' linear paul trap ( shown in figure  4 ) originally designed by the monroe group  @xcite .",
    "an aluminum frame supports the four rf quadrupole rods and the two endcap needle electrodes , all made from 0.5  mm dia .",
    "tungsten wire , separated from each other and from the ground by alumina spacers .",
    "the needles are electrolytically etched from the cylindrical wire stock .",
    "the electrodes are glued to the alumina spacers with a uhv - compatible ceramic adhesive ( scientific instrument services , inc .",
    "the opposite rod centers are about 1.4  mm apart , and end caps are separated by about 2  mm .        our mirror is a commercial - grade aluminum - coated spherical concave 20  mm radius of curvature , 25  mm dia .",
    "mirror . to fit it into the trap frame which has a 2020  mm@xmath2 opening ,",
    "four edges were ground off .",
    "a special aluminum holder was made to keep the mirror normal to the grinding surface to ensure square cut .",
    "to fix the mirror to the frame at the desired distance from the ion trap , a precision holder ( see figure 4(a))was made to support the mirror from underneath such that its curvature center is 10  mm above the needles .",
    "the holder was fixed to the frame by 4 screws and its alignment was fine - tuned in the transverse direction by moving along two knife edges .",
    "the alignment procedure was done under a measurement microscope to achieve better accuracy .",
    "the needles were placed an equal distance ( about 1  mm ) away from the geometric center . however , after being glued into place the trap assembly apparently shifted with respect to the mirror , moving the trapping center about 50  @xmath0 m away from the focal point of the mirror .",
    "the trap and the mirror were mounted inside a kimball physics , inc .",
    "4 - 1/2  conflat spherical octagon vacuum chamber with four 1.33  conflat viewports used for laser access , and one 3.1  mm thick , 1.5  re - entrant fused silica viewport for ion imaging .",
    "to load barium ions into the trap , a simple oven filled with metallic ba was installed near the trap .",
    "the oven is made of a 1  mm diameter alumina tube sealed on one end , and the other end pointing at the trap , with thin tungsten wire wrapped around .",
    "the oven can be easily heated up to a few hundred degrees c by running about 1  a of current through the tungsten filament .",
    "to collimate the atomic barium beam and prevent barium coating of sensitive trap surfaces and the viewports , a 1  mm aperture was placed between the oven and the trap .",
    "a 20 l / s ion pump and a ti sublimation pump maintain ultrahigh vacuum ( better than @xmath11  torr ) around the trap .",
    "the trap is driven by an rf voltage with a few hundred volts amplitude at about 22  mhz generated by a high - q helical resonator  @xcite fed by about 1 watt of rf ; the endcaps are kept at + 100  v dc .",
    "this produces a trapping potential with the transverse secular motion frequencies @xmath12  mhz and the axial frequency @xmath13 of about 100  khz .",
    "we load ba ions into the trap by photoionizing  @xcite neutral barium with a deuterium lamp .",
    "the lamp has significant ultraviolet spectral content near 238  nm , which is the ionization threshold for neutral barium .",
    "we find that this direct photoionization is very efficient and we are able to load ions with very low ba oven temperatures .",
    "barium ions are laser - cooled on the strong @xmath14 transition near 493  nm , with an additional laser near 650  nm for repumping out of the metastable @xmath15 state .",
    "a detailed description of the laser system can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we first set up the imaging system in a way similar to our standard setup . a long working distance , 0.25  n.a .",
    "homebuilt multi - element lens designed after ref .",
    "@xcite was used     ion image taken by the emccd camera using the 0.9  n.a .",
    "spherical mirror , compared to the image of the same ion by a 0.25  n.a .",
    "multi - element lens with total magnification of 70 ( inset ) .",
    "exposure time was 0.8  s for both images .",
    "the pixel size is 10  @xmath0 m .",
    "image intensity is in the ( same ) arbitrary units .",
    "the integrated intensity of the ion image by mirror is about 7.5 times higher than that by multi - element lens . ]    to form an intermediate image of the ion .",
    "a spatial filter ( 0.5  mm pinhole ) was placed in the image plane to reduce the background light including any reflection from the mirror .",
    "the intermediate image was then re - imaged onto an electron - multiplying ccd ( emccd ) camera ( andor@xmath16 luca@xmath17 ) with a 25  mm focal length doublet lens .    a narrow - band , 493  nm interference filter was placed in front of the camera to reduce the background even further .",
    "the trap was shown to work remarkably well , holding single ions for several days even without the laser cooling , in an excellent agreement with our electric field modeling .",
    "an image of a single laser - cooled ba@xmath18 ion generated by this system is shown in the inset of figure  5 .    in a preliminary test run",
    ", we attempted to image the ion onto an emccd camera with the spherical mirror alone ( i.e. without using any corrector element or the microscope objective ) .",
    "to our surprise we found a very sharp image of a single ion about 60  cm from the mirror ( figure  5 ) .",
    "it is from this observation that we conclude that the trap center moved away from the mirror surface during the assembly of the trap .",
    "the distorted image shape is probably due to a combination of the spherical aberration and the coma due to a misalignment of the ion location with the optical axis of the mirror .",
    "the observed increase in the photon count rate of a factor of about 7.5 was not as good as we expected from the relative ratio ( approximately 15 ) of the solid angles of the 0.9  n.a . and 0.25  n.a .",
    "optics , probably because of the large spherical aberration .",
    "a large fraction of the light emitted by the ion is actually diffused around the bright image spot , and falls outside the photon counting aperture .",
    "the background ( which was subtracted by the camera control software ) was rather high due to lack of spatial filtering .",
    "in summary , we built and successfully operated a linear paul ion trap with an integrated spherical mirror and directly imaged and resolved single ions without any additional optics .",
    "a future improvement for correcting spherical aberration with an aspheric lens is proposed and analyzed . with these simple and inexpensive modifications",
    "we hope to increase the trapped ion fluorescence collection efficiency by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we would like to thank nathan pegram for help with early parts of this work and edan shahar , aaron avril , chris dostert , frank garcia and thomas reicken for their assistance .",
