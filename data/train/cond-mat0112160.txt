    "a most convenient microscopic theory of superconductivity is provided by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations  @xcite . on the one hand it encapsulates all the basic ideas of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer and on the other hand it is the general form of the kohn - sham euler - lagarange equations of the density functional theory for superconductors . ever since its formulation semiclassical methods have been used , very successfully , for investigating its solutions under various circumstances  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we wish to contribute to making this method even more effective by developing further the particular approach , based upon effective classical orbits , pioneered by azbel  @xcite .    as in the case of the standard schrdinger equation there are two semiclassical approaches to the problem of solving the bdg equations .",
    "the first , initiated by andreev  @xcite , de gennes  @xcite , and bardeen and co workers  @xcite , utilises the wkb form for the wave function and takes advantage of the slowly varying amplitudes to convert the second order equation into one that is first order in the derivatives and hence more readily soluble .",
    "however the usual machinations of schdinger quantum mechanics e.g. of matching logarithmic derivatives etc . are still employed .",
    "the second approach , initiated by azbel  @xcite , uses effective classical hamiltonians and orbits together with bohr quantisation conditions to study the quasiparticle energy spectra and the corresponding wave functions .",
    "we extend azbel s approach by including an account of complex order parameters , the origin of the maslov indices , the construction of a 3-dimensional wave function , and using torus quantisation , that is to say the full machinery of modern semiclassics  @xcite .",
    "the principle motivation behind such systematic development of semiclassical methods for superconductors is the need to adopt this powerful technique to the treatment of type ii superconductors and those with exotic , @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave , pairing .",
    "this need arises from the difficulty of solving numerically differential equations , such as the bdg equations , which feature many wildly different length scales , such as lattice parameters , @xmath2 , coherence length , @xmath3 , penetration depth , radii of landau orbits , and flux lattice unit cell sizes .",
    "we hope that the replacement of the numerical problems of integrating differential equations by solving hamiltons equations for classical orbits can alleviate some of these difficulties .",
    "the layout of this paper is then as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : semiclassicaltheoryforsuperconductors ] we present a multicomponent semiclassical theory for the bdg equations .",
    "this starts with a discussion of the general form of the semiclassical ansatz before showing how the bdg equations can be reduced , at zeroth order , to the solution of a pair of hamiltonian systems describing the dynamics of quasiparticles along orbits comprised of both particle - like and hole - like segments .",
    "we also include a discussion of topological phases arising from singularities in the phase of pairing potential .",
    "we then solve the first order equations and construct the general multicomponent wave function .",
    "we briefly discuss torus quantisation and demonstrate that ebk quantisation conditions ( a generalisation of bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rules ) can only be constructed in the absence of the above mentioned singularities . in section [ sec : effectivesemiclassicaltheoryforsuperconductors ] we construct an effective semiclassical theory whose hamiltonian systems are @xmath4-dependent . by extending the semiclassical theory in this way",
    "we remove the obsticles to constructing the ebk rules and consequently we present a generalised ebk rule which includes the contribution from both the maslov index and topological phases .",
    "we conclude the section with a discussion of the interpretation of a theory based upon @xmath4-dependent hamiltonian systems .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are devoted to two applications .",
    "thus in section [ sec : sns_junction ] we apply the theory to a superconductor - normal metal - superconductor junction and include a discussion of andreev retro - reflection and the semiclassical spectrum . in an accompanying appendix",
    "we calculate the maslov index by analytically continuing the semiclassical wave functions taking into account of stokes phenomenon .",
    "then in section [ sec : thesinglevortex ] we investigate a single vortex which is an ideal example for demonstrating the rle of the @xmath4-dependence in the hamiltonians and the consequences of the phase singularities in the pairing potential .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion and summary .",
    "to begin , let us recall the conventional semiclassical  @xcite bcs theory of the superconducting state .",
    "the context for the most general version of this is provided by the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the two component wave function for a quasiparticle : @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the fermi energy , @xmath8 is an external potential and @xmath9 is the complex pairing potential satisfying the self - consistency condition @xmath10 ( here @xmath11 is the bcs coupling constant and @xmath12 is the fermi function . ) as usual , the interpretation of the components @xmath13 and @xmath14 is that they are the amplitudes for the quasiparticle being a particle and a hole respectively .",
    "moreover , a state is superconducting if the solution of equations ( [ eqn : bdgequations ] ) , ( [ eqn : hamiltonianoperator ] ) , and ( [ eqn : deltaselfconsistency ] ) is such that @xmath15 .    in",
    "what follows , for a prescribed pairing potential @xmath16 , we develop a multicomponent wkb approximation for solving equation ( [ eqn : bdgequations ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , as @xmath17 , the order of the multicomponent differential equation changes abruptly , just as for a single component equation , and therefore , we expect the solutions to exhibit the familiar essential singularity in the form of the phase @xmath18 .",
    "thus a reasonable guess at the multicomponent generalisation of the wkb wave function would be @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are slowly varying amplitudes",
    ". however , to be systematic , it is more convenient to start with the general complex spinor : @xmath22 where both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are complex quantities to allow for the amplitude and phase variation of each of the components . to proceed we expand them in powers of @xmath4 by writing @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 in keeping with the original definition of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as complex quantities , at every order",
    "the real ( @xmath28 ) and imaginary ( @xmath29 ) parts of @xmath30 and @xmath31 must be determined .",
    "up to and including the first order in @xmath4 the spinor in equation ( [ eqn : complexspinor ] ) then contains the following quantities @xmath32 the question of whether to include @xmath33 ( i.e. a fast degree of freedom for the spinor components ) is a subtle one . if @xmath34 is not expanded in @xmath4 ( and it is usual in semiclassical theory to regard potentials such as @xmath8 and @xmath16 as externally imposed potentials - hence not to expand them ) then it is found that the bdg equations have no expansion in @xmath4 if @xmath35 .",
    "we will return to this point again once we have developed our formalism .",
    "setting @xmath36 in ( [ eqn : complexspinortoorderh ] ) we see the wave function does indeed take the form ( [ eqn : guess ] ) where however @xmath37 is understood to be the _ complex _ slowly varying spinor : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are amplitudes , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are phases , to be determined by solving the appropriate zeroth order and first order equations obtained by substituting ( [ eqn : correctedguess ] ) into the bdg equations and expanding the result in powers of @xmath4 .      noting that @xmath45 may be regarded as a unitary operator suffix on @xmath42 for what follows we drop it from here onwards .",
    "] we may write , in the position representation , @xmath46 applying this procedure to both sides of equation ( [ eqn : bdgequations ] ) one readily finds @xmath47 then , the zeroth order approximation in @xmath4 is obtained by neglecting terms containing @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath48 , whose action upon @xmath20 , @xmath21 is small ) .",
    "then we observe that @xmath34 can be removed from the above equation at each @xmath49-point by a unitary transformation @xmath50 to zeroth order in @xmath4 such transformations of equation ( [ eqn : unitarytransformedbdgequations ] ) yield @xmath51 here @xmath52 is an electron hamiltonian of the form ( [ eqn : hamiltonianoperator ] ) with the momentum operator @xmath53 replaced by @xmath54 , and the same is true for the hole hamiltonian , @xmath55 , except @xmath56 .",
    "since the transformed hamiltonian matrix in equation ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) is real , the spinor wave function is also constrained .",
    "most generally , via equation ( [ eqn : correctedguess ] ) , this implies that @xmath57 for @xmath58 an integer",
    ". however self - consistency , equation ( [ eqn : deltaselfconsistency ] ) , requires that the @xmath16 with which we started our calculation , i.e. @xmath59 , and the @xmath16 constructed from our solutions @xmath60 and @xmath61 be one and the same . since @xmath62",
    ", we must have @xmath63 , @xmath64 an integer , for this to be true .",
    "thus we find @xmath65 but now , since @xmath64 introduces the same sign change for both upper and lower components of the spinor it can be factored out .",
    "choosing the sign of the wave function appropriately @xmath64 is eliminated and we have determined @xmath66 .    in the context of a general solution of the bdg equations it has been observed that if the order parameter , @xmath16 , contains vortices , @xmath67 acquires _ global _ curvature  @xcite i.e @xmath68 for paths , @xmath69 , containing vortices . to clarify the nature of the singularity associated with a vortex in three dimensions observe that it is one where @xmath70 along lines",
    "@xmath34 is then indeterminate i.e. @xmath70 defines a line of phase singularities  @xcite .",
    "if we continue @xmath34 along any path enclosing such a singularity we obtain ( [ eqn : globalcurvature ] ) with @xmath71 on the right hand side . a unitary transformation of the form @xmath72",
    "is then _ multivalued _ , as stressed by anderson  @xcite .",
    "for instance @xmath72 has two branches and moves from one to the other when continued around a vortex .",
    "the same is true for our spinor : if upon the first branch it takes the values @xmath73 then , after a circuit around a vortex , it moves onto the second branch , taking the values @xmath74 ( a second trip around the vortex is required to return the spinor to the original branch . ) thus , through ( [ eqn : sigmaintermsofphi ] ) , we have discovered that @xmath66 may contain a contribution topological in origin which it is in fact simpler depending only upon the topology not the geometry of the path along which it is continued . ] .",
    "this is , however , not a problem for our semiclassical theory . with",
    "@xmath34 removed we must diagonalise the resulting matrix subject to the physical condition that the original wave function in ( [ eqn : guess ] ) is single - valued . as we shall see presently , this constraint will modify the generalised bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rule which we will derive .    a non - trival solution to ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) requires the vanishing of the determinant .",
    "this yields two equations : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath79 defines , implicitly , the functions @xmath80 .    we see immediately that each of the equations ( [ eqn : hamiltonjacobisemiclassical ] ) is a ( stationary ) _ hamilton - jacobi equation _ for a ( fictitous ) classical mechanics .",
    "its solution ( when it exists ) is a classical action function @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a set of action integrals and appears in place of @xmath83 which labelled the eigenvalues of the bdg equation .",
    "thus viewing each @xmath79 as a classical hamiltonian governing the propagation of a quasiparticle excitation the restriction to a constant energy shell in phase space ( @xmath84 ) define the phase space orbits which we shall label @xmath85 . in general the functions",
    "@xmath86 are many - valued functions of @xmath49 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : multivaluedp ] , whose branches shall be indexed by @xmath87 when necessary .",
    "mathematically  @xcite finding a complete integral to the hamilton - jacobi equation is equivalent to solving hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "so we can write down hamilton s equations for the quasiparticle excitation : @xmath88 where after differentiation we must substitute @xmath89 and @xmath90 . since our hamiltonian is conservative , time here is simply a parameter governing the evolution of a quasiparticle along the orbit .",
    "thus the @xmath91 differential matrix bdg equation ( [ eqn : bdgequations ] ) has been reduced , at zeroth order , to a pair of hamiltonian systems for a ( fictitous ) classical mechanics specified by the appropriate hamiltonian in ( [ eqn : classicalhamiltonian ] ) .    a solution to ( [ eqn : hamiltonjacobisemiclassical ] )",
    "is obtained as @xmath92 where integration is carried out along a ray of one of the hamiltonian systems ( [ eqn : hamiltonsequations ] ) .",
    "( for convenience we have chosen the initial condition @xmath93 . )",
    "this does not complete the zeroth order theory however , since our ` particle ' has an internal structure which is represented by the complex spinor defined at every point along the trajectory .",
    "so let us now consider the spinor solution of the bdg equation corresponding to one of these ` classical ' orbits .",
    "it is useful to view the slowly changing quasiparticle spinor of ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) as an axis of pseudo spin quantisation transported along the trajectory defined by @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , this axis can be represented by a vector attached to the orbit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multivaluedp ] ) whose orientation changes as it is carried along the path in phase space .",
    "this vector represents the internal particle - hole degree of freedom of the excitation . to find how the eigenvectors of ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) change as they are carried along the trajectory we diagonalise the hamiltonian matrix , @xmath94 , at every @xmath49-point @xmath95 so that in the locally diagonal frame ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) becomes @xmath96 giving @xmath97 rotating back to the common laboratory frame we have two solutions @xmath98 note that while @xmath99 is a particle in its local frame , ( [ eqn : localdiagonalresults ] ) , it is both particle and hole , with amplitudes @xmath100 and @xmath101 , in the laboratory frame .",
    "if we now substitute @xmath102 into ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) we have the ratio @xmath103 the electron hamiltonian , @xmath104 is @xmath105 by ( [ eqn : classicalhamiltonian ] ) , where @xmath106 , and the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath107 should be used . using this to eliminate @xmath104 from ( [ eqn : ratioofamplitudes ] )",
    "the amplitudes are expressed in terms of @xmath108 and the momentum branches , @xmath109 .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ eqn : electronhamiltoniansns ] ) that each @xmath110 determines a unique choice of @xmath111 ( see also appendix [ app : betajdependence ] ) so that there is one pair of amplitudes for each branch of the momentum .",
    "then the normalised amplitudes are given by @xmath112 ( by normalising we have of course redefined @xmath113 but since we are yet to determine this amplitude we shall not introduce new notation for it . )",
    "this completes the zeroth order theory .    to summarise our results",
    "so far we have shown that a general semiclassical solution for a multicomponent system can be written as a spinor multiplying the familiar phase , @xmath114 ( [ eqn : guess ] ) , where however the spinor is in general a complex quantity ( [ eqn : correctedguess ] ) . using this solution we derived the zeroth order matrix equation ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) and determined one of the spinor phases , @xmath115 , which may have a topological contribution .",
    "we then diagonalised the matrix equations reducing the solution of the bdg equations at zeroth order to the problem of solving a pair of hamiltonian systems for our excitation specified by the classical hamiltonians @xmath116 .",
    "our excitation has an internal structure which , at zeroth order , is represented by the amplitudes ( [ eqn : normalisedamplitudes ] ) .    what is the next step ?",
    "we expect , to first order in @xmath4 , to find a transport equation whose solution furnishes us with the amplitude @xmath117 .",
    "we also have the phase @xmath118 to determine which , like @xmath66 , is not familiar from single - component wkb analysis .",
    "once we have determined these quantities our semiclassical wave function will be used to construct the rule which quantises our classical dynamics .      to derive the first order equations we take the expectation value of equation ( [ eqn : unitarytransformedbdgequations ] ) and expand the result in powers of @xmath4 .",
    "one can then show ( see appendix [ sec : appendixa ] ) that there are two equations to first order in @xmath4 : @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the first of these equations , ( [ eqn : transportequation ] ) , is the transport equation and can be rewritten ( see appendix [ sec : appendixa ] ) as @xmath121 it expresses the fact that the product @xmath122 , at each point , must be conserved ( there are no sources or sinks ) . thus if the local velocity of a quasiparticle increases the probability of finding it there decreases , and vice versa .",
    "solving equation ( [ eqn : amplitudetransportequation ] ) by the van vleck  @xcite method gives @xmath123 where @xmath69 is a constant .",
    "the second equation is more troublesome .",
    "it resembles the connection enforcing parallel transport in berry s theory of geometric phases  @xcite",
    ". however , equation ( [ eqn : firstorderphasesequation ] ) can not be solved to yield a geometric phase .",
    "rather we find ( see appendix [ sec : appendixa ] ) @xmath124 where @xmath125 equation ( [ eqn : firstorderphase ] ) is not a line integral .",
    "a physical interpretation to @xmath43 is given in appendix [ sec : appendixa ] .",
    "we should not be surprised that our theory contains both a topological phase and another phase which can not be expressed either geometrically or topologically . in a different context",
    ", it is known  @xcite that the asymptotics solutions of matrix differential equations can contain such terms .    bringing all our results together",
    ", the multicomponent semiclassical wave functions for the bogoliubov - de gennes equations with action @xmath126 take the form @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a constant .      to construct a quantisation rule",
    "we must consider the behaviour of ( [ eqn : wavefunctionforoned ] ) along rays of the hamiltonian system ( [ eqn : hamiltonsequations ] ) .",
    "thus we must first discuss the properties of the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that for a classical mechanics with @xmath129 degrees of freedom to be integrable there must be @xmath129 constants of the motion .",
    "for such a system the dynamics takes place on an @xmath129-dimensional ( lagrangian ) submanifold in phase space , which has the topology of an @xmath129-torus  @xcite . to perform a canonical transformation from old coordinates @xmath130 to new coordinates @xmath131 , where @xmath132 are angle coordinates on the torus , one constructs the action function , @xmath133 , which is a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the given classical mechanics .",
    "then the transformation is specified by @xmath134 the action variables , @xmath135 , which are constants of the motion , are given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the @xmath138th irreducible loop on the @xmath129-torus .",
    "the energy can then be expressed solely in terms of these constants , @xmath139 , and hamiltons equations of motion can then be integrated explicitly .",
    "it is also well known  @xcite that the semiclassical approximation to the spectrum of the schrdinger equation with a hamiltonian whose classical dynamics is integrable , proceeds via the semiclassical wave function ( whose multicomponent generalisation we have given as ( [ eqn : wavefunctionforoned ] ) ) .",
    "the single - valuedness of this wave function when followed around each of the irreducible loops upon the torus yields the @xmath129 quantisation conditions @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are integers .",
    "@xmath142 is the maslov index  @xcite , and accounts for a change of @xmath143 in the phase of the wave function each time a caustic is crossed .",
    "the maslov index of a closed curve is defined to be the number of times @xmath144 changes sign from negative to positive , minus the number of times @xmath144 changes sign from positive to negative .",
    "it is a topological invariant of a lagrangian torus .",
    "the quantisation conditions ( [ eqn : ebkconditions ] ) are the so called einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) quantisation rules , the generalisation of the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rules of ` old ' quantum mechanics to encompass non - separable problems .",
    "what we require is the multicomponent generalisation of the ebk rules . since the multicomponent theory was reduced to two hamiltonian systems one might think that the ebk rules apply to the tori for each hamiltonian system .",
    "we start by writing the most general semiclassical wave function , which due to the multivaluedness of @xmath145 is given by the superposition principle of quantum mechanics as @xmath146 where @xmath87 runs over all the branches , @xmath147 , which together make up the torus .",
    "firstly consider a situation where @xmath148 .",
    "such a situation occurs when @xmath149 .",
    "then it is clear that single - valuedness of this wave function does yields a quantisation condition of the form ( [ eqn : ebkconditions ] ) .",
    "now generalise to the case where @xmath67 has global curvature . then the contribution to the change of phase around a closed path arising from the topologically non - trivial @xmath34 is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is an integer .",
    "however the phase @xmath152 poses a greater problem since as discussed it is not locally path independent so that it prevents us from constructing an analog of ( [ eqn : ebkconditions ] ) in the most general circumstances which we will be interested in .",
    "this problem has been discussed in the context of multicomponent wave equations by littlejohn and flynn  @xcite .",
    "they proposed using hamiltonians which include first order terms in @xmath4 .",
    "for these new hamiltonians the effect of @xmath153 is already included in the ` zeroth order ' theory .",
    "their results were limited to systems with no global degeneracies and , as discussed by emmrich and weinstein  @xcite , integrability of the underlying classical dynamics does not garantee an extension of the ebk rules for degenerate systems .",
    "recently bolte and keppeler  @xcite presented a semiclassical theory for the dirac equation based on semiclassical trace formulae , rather than multicomponent wkb , at least in part to avoid these difficulties ( and also to handle non - integrable dynamics ) . in our case , at the present time , this will not be necessary . in the next section we will follow a similar proceedure to littlejohn and flynn which however will differ in that the hamiltonians we construct will naturally be seen to contain terms up to @xmath154 .",
    "( this takes our work outside of the considerations of the above citations  @xcite . ) later in this paper , when we study the single vortex , the inclusion of @xmath154 terms in the hamiltonian turns out to be essential in order to obtain the known ( exact ) wave function at the origin .",
    "( note that there is no reason to object to @xmath4-dependent terms in the ` classical ' hamiltonians since it is an effective ( fictitous ) classical mechanics that we are considering . )",
    "we start by writing the spinor in terms of amplitudes and phases @xmath155 but this time we _ do nt _ expand @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are again determined by the zeroth and first order equations of the theory but these equations will be different from those obtained by asymptotics in @xmath4 . substituting ( [ eqn : resummedspinor ] ) into the bdg equations and proceeding as before we obtain , instead of ( [ eqn : unitarytransformedbdgequations ] ) , the equations @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the @xmath4-dependent momentum , and proceed with asymptotics in the small parameter @xmath4 . ] .",
    "we are not yet ready to make any simplifying approximations since the spinor still contains a phase .",
    "we use @xmath158 ( [ eqn : singularunitarymatrix ] ) to remove @xmath34 at every @xmath49-point and obtain @xmath159 for an appropriate zeroth order theory the spinor written in this form is indeed real as we now demonstrate .    to simplify the equations ( [ eqn : unitarytransformedbdgtoallorders ] )",
    "we must drop the differential operators whose action upon @xmath39 and @xmath40 is small .",
    "previously this was achieved by discarding all terms containing @xmath4 ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "however consistency would then require us to replace @xmath161 by @xmath162 which we do not want . rather than use @xmath4 as our ordering parameter we instead use @xmath163 itself .",
    "thus our zeroth order theory is obtained by dropping @xmath163 to give the analog of ( [ eqn : realzerothorderbdgequations ] ) i.e. , @xmath164 where now @xmath165 , @xmath166 is an electron hamiltonian of the form ( [ eqn : hamiltonianoperator ] ) with the momentum operator @xmath53 replaced by @xmath161 , _ and _ the vector potential @xmath167 replaced by an effective vector potential @xmath168 .",
    "the hole hamiltonian , @xmath169 , is the same as @xmath166 except @xmath56 .",
    "since the resulting matrix hamiltonian is real we have @xmath170 and again , as a consequence of ( [ eqn : globalcurvature ] ) , we see that @xmath26 can contain a topological contribution .",
    "our new theory yields the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath171 where two new @xmath4-dependent hamiltonians , @xmath172 , have replaced the hamiltonians @xmath116 appearing in our previous theory .",
    "explicitly the new hamiltonians are @xmath173 where @xmath76 and @xmath174 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath172 defines implicitly the functions @xmath175 , and the solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equations , when they exist , have the form @xmath176 where the integrals are taken along trajectories of the hamiltonian systems @xmath177 the @xmath4-dependent hamiltonians ( [ eqn : hdependentclassicalhamiltonian ] ) together with the hamiltonian systems they define , and the @xmath4-dependent action ( [ eqn : hdependentaction ] ) are a central result of this paper .",
    "@xmath178 is clearly a locally path independent quantity since @xmath179 is a solution of hamilton s equations and thus lies in a lagrangian torus in phase space .",
    "if we can prove that no other phases appear in our theory the action can immediately be used to construct a quantisation condition .",
    "you will notice that the hamiltonians ( [ eqn : hdependentclassicalhamiltonian ] ) include a term in @xmath180 , that is a term of order @xmath154 as alluded to in the preceeding section .",
    "in concluding the zeroth order theory we see that the normalised amplitudes , representing the internal structure of our ` particle ' as it is transported along the trajectory , become @xmath181 thus the amplitudes too have become @xmath4-dependent .      to derive the new first order equation we take the expectation value of equation ( [ eqn : unitarytransformedbdgtoallorders ] ) .",
    "by defining @xmath182 and introducing @xmath183 for the @xmath4-dependent matrix differential operator : @xmath184 we can write this expectation as @xmath185 expanding this equation upto and including first order in @xmath163 we find @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the zeroth order @xmath4-dependent hamiltonian matrix @xmath188 @xmath189 is given by equation ( [ eqn : gspinor ] ) together with the zeroth order condition ( [ eqn : sigmaintermsofphitoallorders ] ) i.e. @xmath190 which does not contain any phases , @xmath191 allows for corrections beyond those considered in @xmath189 ( in analogy with the semiclassical theory ( appendix [ sec : appendixa ] ) ) , and @xmath192 is @xmath193 where @xmath194 .",

    "however our string has a physical reality , lying along the node of the order parameter unlike a dirac string which need not lie along a node .",
    "hence we will stick with the ` line of phase singularities ' terminology .",
    "@xmath234 is then the vector potential associated with such a line of singularities .",
    "we can then interpret equation ( [ eqn : bdgwithquantisedstring ] ) as describing superconducting quasiparticles in the presence of lines of phase singularities of the pairing potential , each carrying a flux , @xmath232 .",

    "if however the classical dynamics is non - integrable then the solution can not have the form ( [ eqn : wavefunctioneffective ] ) .",
    "we return to this point at the end of the paper .    in the interest of clarity concerning the above discussion we would like to make the following remark .",
    "if for a moment we consider a single vortex whose axis lies along the @xmath238-axis , then by symmetry @xmath239 in polar coordinates .",

    "if we consider the limit @xmath243 as representing an idealised ab flux tube , or ab flux line then equations ( [ eqn : quantisedstringa ] ) and ( [ eqn : aharanovbohma ] ) become identical for the choice @xmath244 .",
    "for this reason a vortex has been described in the literature  @xcite as an effective magnetic aharonov - bohm half - flux .",
    "however we would like to point out here that there is a crucial difference between an ab flux line and a superconducting vortex , namely that the single - valuedness of the ab wave function does _ not _ quantise the flux , @xmath245 , which remains classical  @xcite , whilst single - valuedness of the order parameter , @xmath16 , _ does _ quantise the flux , @xmath232 .",
    "for this reason we prefer the line of phase singularities terminology .",
    "we have one last point to make . in our original discussion of the general form for the wave function we remarked ( see the paragraph following equation ( [ eqn : complexspinortoorderh ] ) ) that if @xmath34 is not expanded in @xmath4 , which we claim to be the correct procedure , then there is no fast component to the spinor i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "conversely had we insisted upon expanding @xmath246 the zeroth order theory would have included the term @xmath247 . in the light of our effective semiclassical theory we now see that even though @xmath34 is not to be expanded , i.e. , @xmath248 , the most useful form for the theory has @xmath249 appearing in the `` zeroth order '' theory hamiltonians .",
    "this concludes our formalism for seeking semiclassical solutions to superconducting problems described by the bdg equations ( [ eqn : bdgequations ] ) .",
    "the general procedure is then as follows : ( i ) choose @xmath167 and @xmath16 appropriate to the situation of interest .",

    "( steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) can be interchanged if analytic expressions are being sort . ) depending upon the situation it may also be important to : ( v ) investigate tunnelling between classical orbits and its effect upon the semiclassical spectrum , for example the lifting of degeneracies to yield ` avoided crossings ' . ( vi )",
    "one may also deploy the wave function to study properties other than the energy spectrum ( for example , quasiparticle current flow ) .    in the next two sections we will apply this theory to two well known problems .",
    "the first we will consider is a superconductor - normal metal -superconductor ( sns ) junction . for this system we will focus upon understanding the various branches of @xmath250 which make up a trajectory in a superconducting system , and upon the type of quasiparticles they represent .",
    "we will then quantise the orbit and obtain the spectrum .",
    "furthermore we will compute the maslov index , though via the more ` traditional ' route of asymptotic analysis , and show that it is what one would expect from following maslov s topological prescription . since for the sns junction we take @xmath251 the two theories presented in sections [ sec : semiclassicaltheoryforsuperconductors ] and [ sec : effectivesemiclassicaltheoryforsuperconductors ] are identical .",
    "by contrast the second problem we apply our theory to , the single vortex , has @xmath252 .",
    "the significance of the topological phase and @xmath4-dependent terms in the theory will then become apparent .",
    "a superconductor - normal metal - superconductor junction ( sns ) consists of a taking a superconducting wire and replacing a segment with a piece of normal metal .",

    "we shall allow @xmath255 to have a smoothly varying profile at each interface .",
    "this contrasts with the more usual approach in the literature  @xcite of taking the profile of @xmath256 to be a step function at each interface .",

    "as stated above , the small @xmath420 behaviour of @xmath489 agrees with the work of caroli , de gennes and matricon  @xcite , and now we also see that the global behaviour of @xmath489 is in agreement with the general findings of bardeen , kmmel , jacobs and tewordt  @xcite .",
    "however our method of solution differs substantially from the work of these authors .",
    "in this paper we have developed a semiclassical theory for quasiparticles in superconductors . in doing",
    "so we have pushed semiclassical methods to the limit by constructing a ( fictitous ) classical mechanics describing the orbits of quasiparticles propagating in the presence of lines of phase singularities . adopting this approach",
    "enabled us to bring the full machinery of modern semiclassics to the problem .",
    "in particular we used torus quantisation to construct a generalised ebk quantisation rule for determining the semiclassical spectrum .",

    "the later is a direct consequence of phase singularities of the pairing potential , i.e. , vortices .",
    "the power of this approach , first considered by azbel in the superconducting context , and extended by us here , lies in the general nature of the hamiltonian system we have constructed . unlike the approach of other authors  @xcite where one must return to the bdg equations for each new problem and consider solving the differential equation across various length scales , here our starting point is with the hamiltonians , ( [ eqn : hdependentclassicalhamiltonian ] ) , and hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "once the pairing potential , vector potential and crystal lattice potential have been chosen for the problem at hand one can immediately investigate the quasiparticle orbits . in the case where the classical dynamics is integrable one",
    "can then proceed , via the generalised ebk rule , to quantise the quasiparticle motion . to make this possible",
    "a number of technical challenges needed to be overcome .",
    "most important amoungst these was the observation that ` standard ' semiclassics ( i.e. , asymptotics in the small parameter @xmath4 ) does not , in the multicomponent case , lead to the construction of a generalised ebk rule .",
    "we resolved this problem by constructing a new semiclassical theory whose corresponding hamiltonian system contains @xmath4-dependent terms .",
    "for such a system , as we have shown , a generalised ebk quantisation rule does exist .",
    "we demonstrated the power of our approach by solving two well known problems chosen to elucidate those aspects of the theory which are new ( @xmath4-dependent hamiltonians and topological phases due to vortices ) .",
    "of course the problems we have considered have integrable classical dynamics .",
    "however there are many situations one may wish to solve where the classical dynamics is non - integrable .",
    "thus we should examine which aspects of our theory remain valid in this case .",
    "when our hamiltonian system exhibits chaos our corresponding ( stationary ) hamilton - jacobi equation has no solution , i.e. , the eigenstates of the bdg equations can not have the ` simple ' multicomponent wkb form .",
    "since our ` classical ' mechanics was derived in the first place using this ansatz for the wave function one must question whether the hamiltonian system has any meaning for non - integrable systems .",
    "the answer is yes and the reason is as follows .",
    "if we start with the time - dependent bdg equations , ( replace @xmath491 by @xmath492 in ( [ eqn : bdgequations ] ) ) , and seek a solution in terms of a time - dependent multicomponent wkb ansatz , then we obtain , in place of the stationary hamilton - jacobi equation , the time dependent hamilton - jacobi equation : @xmath493 a solution to this equation always exists unlike for the stationary version .",
    "the hamiltonian system corresponding to ( [ eqn : timehamiltonjacobi ] ) is identical to the one for the stationary equation and thus we have discovered our ( fictitous ) classical mechanics is the correct one to describe quasiparticle dynamics in superconductors regardless of the type of the dynamics exhibited .",
    "( the same can not be said of our eigenfunction ( [ eqn : wavefunctioneffective ] ) , and the generalised ebk rule neither of which have any meaning in chaotic systems for which trace formulae must be derived  @xcite . )",
    "one of our principle motivations for developing the semiclassical theory was to construct a microscopic theory of quasiparticles in superconductors in large magnetic fields .",

    "this is a regular lattice of vortices , each carrying one superconducting flux quantum , @xmath232 , and having supercurrents associated with it .",
    "we have developed a simplified model of this state  @xcite , whose dynamics is integrable , and have used it to give an explaination of the origin of de haas - van alphen oscillations in type ii superconductors .",
    "another problem for which the above strategy may be usefully deployed is that of the mesoscopic metals proximity coupled a superconductor.the refined semiclassics we have presented here may serve as a bases for including ` quantum diffraction ' corrections missing from the naive analysis criticised by altland , simons and taras - semchuk  @xcite .",
    "finally we point out that the theory we have presented is restricted to @xmath494-wave pairing .",
    "an ongoing ` hot - topic ' in superconductivity research is exotic superconductivity , in particular @xmath1- and @xmath0- wave pairing .",
    "we are in the process of extending our present theory to encompuss exotic pairing so that we may study quasiparticle orbits in the presence of @xmath1- and @xmath0-wave pairing potentials in magnetic fields .",

    "returning to the problem at hand it is clear that a significant simplification of fig .",
    "[ fig : stokeslinesfortwoturningpointssns ] is possible .",
    "we need only consider those stokes lines ( shown in figure [ fig : simplifiedproblemstokeslines ] ) whose stokes constants are non - zero .",

    "this is what is expected for the maslov index of a lagrangian manifold which is topologically a circle . in the present case , from our approach",

    "this concludes our derivation of the quantisation condition .    before leaving this section",
    "we wish to comment that in the main body of this paper the explicit solutions are written down for each region .",
    "since we require these for @xmath769 , between the turning points , and our solutions in sector 3 and 4 are for @xmath770 , we must take the functional forms @xmath771 and rewrite them in terms of @xmath595 i.e. , we must follow the solutions in sector 3 across the branch cut connecting @xmath300 and @xmath385 .",
    "again we use the rules ( [ eqn : psi1intermsofpsi3])-([eqn : psi4intermsofpsi2 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : purephasefactor1to3])-([eqn : purephasefactor4to2 ] ) .",

    "it is well known  @xcite that in the @xmath430 limit the bdg equations can be solved exactly .",
    "writing the wave function in the form @xmath780 the bdg equations are reduced to a radial equation for @xmath781 : @xmath782 ( since @xmath783 as @xmath430 . ) here @xmath784 , @xmath785 the fermi wave vector , and @xmath786 is a pauli spin matrix .",

    "we see that the @xmath430 limit for @xmath781 is @xmath793 where @xmath794 , i.e. there is integer power law decay of the particle and hole wave functions approaching the origin .",
    "the spinor amplitudes in ( [ eqn : rtozerosemiclassical ] ) are given by equation ( [ eqn : normalisedamplitudes ] ) .",
    "expanding as @xmath430 , and noting that @xmath801 , we obtain @xmath802 ( here we have assumed @xmath803 . ) we also have : @xmath804 from which it follows that @xmath805 and since @xmath806 we have @xmath807 in the last two equations the phase reference point @xmath808 ( @xmath809 ) is chosen to be the classical turning point defined by @xmath810 ( @xmath811 ) .",
    "we have not yet calculated @xmath812 , but if we assume it can be neglected the appropriate superposition as @xmath430 , call it @xmath813 , takes the form @xmath814 in particular we note the _ half _ integer power law decay of the particle and hole wave functions in contrast to the exact result ( [ eqn : besselatorigin ] ) .",
    "this is completely unsatisfactory .",

    "using @xmath816 we have : @xmath817 and using @xmath818 @xmath819 then @xmath813 becomes @xmath820 which has the correct integer power law decay as required .",
    "by following through this analysis we have discovered the importance of the first order phase , @xmath815 .",
    "we have also checked that the semiclassical theory carried out correctly gives not only a quantisation rule but also the wave function as well .",
    "does our effective semiclassical theory do as well ?",
    "the spinor amplitudes in ( [ eqn : rtozeroeffective ] ) are given by equation ( [ eqn : normalisedamplitudeseffective ] ) .",
    "expanding these as @xmath430 we obtain @xmath822 the @xmath823 rather than @xmath28 correction arises since @xmath824 so that @xmath825 .",
    "now @xmath826 notice the appearance of @xmath827 here rather than @xmath828 in equation ( [ eqn : semiclassicalprexpanded ] ) .",
    "it follows from this that @xmath829 and @xmath830 thus the appropriate combination , call it @xmath831 , takes the form @xmath832 which has the correct integer power law decay agreeing with the previous two solutions . in the present case",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath833 in equation ( [ eqn : effectiveprexpanded ] ) was crucial to obtain the dependence upon @xmath834 .",
