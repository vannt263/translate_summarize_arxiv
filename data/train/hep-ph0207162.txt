    "a sketch of the nb / gaas / algaas structure is shown in fig .",
    "the semiconductor portion consists of a 1 @xmath0 m thick @xmath1-gaas(001 ) buffer layer si - doped nominally at @xmath2 @xmath3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on a @xmath1-gaas(001 ) substrate , followed by a 4 nm thick al@xmath4ga@xmath5as barrier .",
    "this was followed by the growth of a 12 nm thick gaas(001 ) epilayer si - doped at @xmath2 @xmath3 and by 14 nm of gaas doped by a sequence of six si @xmath6-doped layers spaced by 2 nm . a 1-@xmath0m - thick amorphous as cap layer",
    "was deposited in the mbe growth chamber to protect the surface during transfer in air to an uhv sputter - deposition / surface analysis system .",
    "after thermal desorption of the as protective cap layer , a 100-nm - thick nb film was then deposited _ in situ _ by dc - magnetron sputtering .",
    "the thickness of the gaas epilayer sandwiched between the superconductor and the algaas barrier was selected in order to have an experimentally - accessible single quasi - bound state below the superconductive gap , and the si @xmath6-doped layers at the nb / gaas interface were employed to achieve the required transmissivity .",
    "more detail on the contact fabrication procedure is reported elsewhere @xcite where the reference sn junctions are also described .",
    "the latter consisted of a nb/@xmath6-doped - gaas junction _ without _ the algaas insulating barrier .",
    "a qualitative sketch of the energy - band diagram of our snin structure is depicted in fig .",
    "100@xmath7160@xmath0m@xmath8 junctions were defined by standard photolithographic techniques and reactive ion etching .",
    "4-wire measurements were performed with two leads on the junction under study and the other two connected to the sample back contact .",
    "the measured differential conductances @xmath9 bias ( @xmath10 ) for the resonant structure ( snin structure , panel ( a ) ) and for the reference junction ( sn structure , panel ( b ) ) at @xmath11 k are shown in fig .",
    "comparison of the two characteristics clearly shows the presence of a marked dgsj subgap conductance peak in the snin , resonant device .",
    "the resonance is superimposed to the typical andreev - dominated subgap conductance .",
    "the symmetry of conductance and the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) peculiar to reflectionless tunneling ( rt ) @xcite further demonstrate the effectiveness of the fabrication protocol .",
    "quantitative determination of the resonant transport properties in such a system is not trivial as it can be inferred by inspecting fig .",
    "1(b ) and considering the diffusive nature of the normal regions .",
    "dgsj - enhancement , however , is an intrinsically ballistic phenomenon so that its essential features can be captured with relative ease .",
    "one study particularly relevant for our system was performed in ref.@xcite . in the context of ballistic transport a one - dimensional snin structure was studied as a function of the n interlayer thickness @xmath12 and it was demonstrated that resonances can occur in the subgap conductance spectrum for suitable geometric conditions .",
    "the insulating barrier was simulated by a @xmath6-like potential .",
    "customarily the barrier strength is described by the dimensionless coefficient @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electron fermi velocity @xcite and @xmath15 the barrier amplitude , and in the following we shall make use of it to characterize our system .",
    "the key - results of the analysis are : ( _ a _ ) the number of resonances increases for larger thickness @xmath12 of the metallic interlayer and is virtually independent of @xmath16 ; ( _ b _ ) the energy - width of such resonances decreases for increasing @xmath16 .",
    "this model is rather idealized , but is a useful tool to grasp the essential features of our system such as number and position of resonances @xcite . in order to apply it",
    "we must first determine parameters such as barrier strength , electron density and mean free path .",
    "also , any quantitative comparison with experiment requires us to estimate the sample series resistance , which influences the experimental energy position of the resonance peak .",
    "the above parameters can be obtained from an analysis of the rt - driven zbcp and from hall measurements .",
    "we performed hall measurements at 1.5 k and obtained carrier density @xmath17@xmath3 and mobility @xmath18@xmath19/v s. these data allow us to estimate the thermal coherence length @xmath20m@xmath21 , where @xmath22cm@xmath8/s is the diffusion constant , and the electron mean free path @xmath24 nm . @xmath25 compares favorably with the geometrical constraints of the structure ( @xmath26 nm @xmath27 ) and further supports our ballistic analysis .",
    "the zbcp can be described following the work by beenakker and co - workers @xcite .",
    "their model system consists of a normal disordered region of length @xmath28 and width @xmath29 separated by a finite - transparency barrier from a superconductor . under appropriate conditions a zbcp",
    "is predicted to occur , whose width @xmath30 ( i.e. , the voltage at which the zbcp is suppressed ) was estimated to be of the order of the thouless voltage , @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , upon application of a magnetic field , the zbcp is suppressed for fields of the order of @xmath32 . in real systems , at finite temperatures , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are to be replaced by @xmath33 , if it is smaller @xcite . at 0.34",
    "m and in our junctions we calculate @xmath35@xmath0v .",
    "comparison with the experimental value @xmath36@xmath0v in fig .",
    "2(c ) ( see solid line ) , allowed us to estimate the series resistance contribution to the measured conductivity .",
    "this rather large effect stems mainly from the algaas barrier and the sample back - contact resistance .",
    "we calculated the conductance for the nominal n - thickness value ( @xmath37 nm ) and @xmath38 , as appropriate for the algaas barrier @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the essential features such as the number and energy position of the dgsj resonances are virtually independent of z and are controlled instead by the value of @xmath12 .",
    "our calculations yield a single conductance peak at energies corresponding to about @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the superconductor energy gap . by including the above - determined series resistance contribution ,",
    "the resonance peak is positioned at about @xmath41mv ( see fig .",
    "2(c ) , dash - dotted line , @xmath11 k ) .",
    "the corresponding experimental value is about 3 mv ( solid line in fig .",
    "2(c ) ) , but the observed energy difference is well within the uncertainty resulting from the determination of the series resistance .",
    "the results of our model calculations strongly support our interpretation of the experimental structure in terms of dgsj resonant transport .    ordinary resonant tunneling in the normal double - barrier potential schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) can not explain the observed subgap structure .",
    "this is indicated by the symmetry in the experimental data for positive and negative bias and is further proven by the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the differential conductance .",
    "figure 3 shows a set of @xmath10s measured in the 0.34 - 1.55 k range for the zbcp , ( a ) , and for the resonance peak , ( b ) .",
    "both effects show a strong dependence on temperature and at @xmath42 k are totally suppressed .",
    "this temperature value is within the range where rt suppression is expected @xcite . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the conductance in the resonance region resembles that of the reference sn junction of fig .",
    "notably , the zbcp and the resonance peak disappear at the same temperature , hence indicating the coherent nature of the observed effect .",
    "further confirmation of the nature of the resonance peak can be gained observing its dependence from the magnetic field .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath10 at @xmath43k for several values of the magnetic field applied in the plane of the junction for the zbcp , ( a ) , and for the resonance peak , ( b ) .",
    "the measurements confirm the known sensitivity of zbcp to the magnetic field @xcite , and clearly indicate that the dgsj resonance is easily suppressed for critical fields of the order of 100 mt . in the perpendicular field configuration at @xmath44k ( see fig .",
    "4(c),(d ) ) the resonance and the zbcp displayed a similar dependence .",
    "such behavior is fully consistent with dgsj - related origin but is not compatible with a normal resonant tunneling description of the data @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally observed dgsj resonant states in nb / gaas / algaas hybrid heterostructures .",
    "transport was studied as a function of temperature and magnetic field and was successfully described within the ballistic model of riedel and bagwell@xcite .",
    "the present results suggest that the nb / gaas / algaas system is a good candidate for the implementation of complex mesoscopic structures that can take advantage of the mature algaas nanofabrication technology .",
    "such structures may represent ideal prototype systems for the study of coherent transport and the implementation of novel hybrid devices .",
    "this work was sponsored by infm under the pais project eiss .",
    "we confined our calculation to a one - dimensional case in light of the results by s. chaudhuri and p. f. bagwell , phys .",
    "b * 51 * , 16936 ( 1995 ) .",
    "these authors showed the insensitivity to dimensionality of the essential properties of transport resonances .",
    "resonances are determined by inspecting the @xmath10 behavior ."
