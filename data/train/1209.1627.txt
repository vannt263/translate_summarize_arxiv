    "in the accompanying letter , we describe how torsional oscillators ( to ) , containing disk - shaped slabs of @xmath0he - a , respond differently when the direction of rotation is reversed due to the presence of a chiral monodomain @xmath1 texture . in this supplementary note , we calculate @xmath125 for two different initial textures ( shown in fig",
    ". 2 in the letter and also reproduced in fig . 1 in this note ) .",
    "the changes in the moment of inertia are calculated and we find that the distinctive response observed in the experiment can be explained with an initial monodomain @xmath1 texture containing a trapped double - quantum atc vortex .",
    "superfluid @xmath0he benefits from a detailed microscopic theory @xcite , facilitating calculations that can be compared to experimental observations .",
    "we use the london limit , where the order parameter is always that for bulk @xmath0he - abut the container boundaries along with competing orientational effects determine the direction and spatial variation ( texture ) of the orbital vector @xmath1 .",
    "we have calculated axisymmetric @xmath1-textures in a slab of @xmath0he - ain the dipole - locked limit .",
    "the upper and lower surfaces of the slab are at @xmath126 with the outer perimeter at @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath1 texture , @xmath128 , was parameterized using euler angles ( @xmath129,@xmath130,@xmath131 ) as @xmath132 with the third angle , @xmath131 , representing an additional rotation about @xmath1 .",
    "the boundary condition that @xmath1 must be perpendicular to the slab surfaces for a monodomain texture with @xmath133 was obtained by setting @xmath134 at @xmath126 and @xmath135 at @xmath127 .",
    "the components of the superfluid velocity , @xmath136 , are given by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is an integer representing the number of circulation quanta that is trapped on the central axis of the slab .",
    "we use natural units where @xmath139 throughout this note .",
    "the normal component is locked to the container and undergoes solid body rotation , @xmath140 where @xmath71 is the angular velocity of the applied rotation .        where @xmath142 is the counterflow and",
    "we have neglected surface terms . the texture with the lowest free energy obtained under particular conditions will be determined by the competing terms in eq .",
    "[ fenergy ] along with the boundary condition .",
    "the second term favours @xmath143 whereas the final three terms favor spatially uniform textures .",
    "the third and fourth terms are due to the interaction between flow and regions of inhomogeneous texture .",
    "this coupling plays a vital role in our case because the to is primarily sensitive to the non - uniform textures at the outer perimeter and the applied flow due to rotation is also the highest in this region . at @xmath144",
    "the coefficents of the various terms in eq .",
    "[ fenergy ] are related by @xmath145 using the coefficients @xcite calculated for the temperature at which the measurement was performed produced a marginally better fit to the data , but does not change any of the main features of the calculated to response .",
    "thus , for simplicity , all of the calculations described below use @xmath146 . for the infinite slab geometry , the ground state is a uniform texture ( @xmath147 ) when @xmath148 .",
    "the texture in the middle of the slab ( @xmath149 ) will begin to align with the flow when @xmath150 , known as a fredericksz transition .",
    "we thus use @xmath151 as a natural unit for angular velocity in the simulations described below .",
    "the fredericksz transition in a finite disk - shaped slab will occur at @xmath152 due to the transition ( i.e. the inital tipping of @xmath1 in the azimuthal direction ) occurring at a distance @xmath64 from the outer perimeter .    in order to determine the equilbrium texture for particular values of @xmath153 , and @xmath138 the free energy was minimized by solving the euler lagrange equations , @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "the terms in the three euler - lagrange equations were found using _ mathematica _ and then solved numerically for different values of @xmath153 using _ flexpde _ , a commercial finite - element method solver .",
    "the simulations were typically started for @xmath156 . we found that using a simple initial guess of @xmath157 , @xmath158",
    ", @xmath159 rapidly converged to a stable solution .",
    "these solutions were then used as an initial guess for subsequent calculations with a slightly different value of @xmath71 . in order to compare the simulations to the experiments , we calculate @xmath160 which reflects the changes in the moment of inertia due to the anisotropy of the superfluid density following the flow induced re - alignment of @xmath1 ( @xmath161 when @xmath162 and @xmath163 when @xmath164 everywhere ) .",
    "thus , the small shifts in the resonant frequency and bandwidth of our to are proportional to changes in @xmath165 .",
    "firstly , a monodomain texture in a disk - shaped slab is essentially a mermin - ho vortex with a single quantum of circulation .",
    "there is thus superflow , @xmath166 , that flows within @xmath23 from the outer perimeter of the slab where the texture bends radially outwards .",
    "this means that the applied counterflow is slightly different ( @xmath167 ) depending on the sense of rotation and so will produce a splitting of the fredericksz transition for the two directions of rotation : @xmath168 for @xmath169=19.23 .",
    "this is much smaller than the experimentally observed splitting of @xmath170 ( fig . 3 in the main letter ) .",
    "secondly , a similar effect can be produced by trapped vorticity in the centre of the slab , which has superflow , @xmath171 , but unlike the superflow due to the edge texture , this flow affects the whole slab rather than a limited region at the outer perimeter .",
    "this gives a splitting @xmath172 and so choosing an appropriate value of @xmath138 will reproduce the observed splitting , however , it can not explain the very different slopes of the observed frequency shifts for @xmath173 .",
    "thirdly , there is coupling between regions of non - uniform @xmath1 ( where @xmath174 ) and flow due to the @xmath175 and @xmath176 terms in eq .",
    "[ fenergy ] . for the inital monodomain texture at low velocities @xmath177",
    ", @xmath178 is non - zero near the outer perimeter but also changes sign depending on the direction of the flow which will also result in splitting of the fredericksz transition but can also produce different slopes of the observed frequency shifts for the different directions of rotation as it affects the distance from the outer perimeter where the texture first begins to tip in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the components of @xmath1 across the middle of the slab ( @xmath149 ) going radially outwards from the centre are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1s ] for two different initial textures at three values of @xmath100 for both directions of rotation . in general",
    ", @xmath1 will begin to tip azimuthally when the local counterflow exceeds @xmath179 .",
    "this will occur somewhere near the outer perimeter initally and then the belt of tipped texture begins to spread radially inwards as the flow is increased .",
    "this is observed for all the configurations of parameters we have tried but the details of the texture differ due to the effects described above .",
    "[ fig1s](a ) corresponds to the texture described in the letter , where a double - quantum atc vortex is trapped in the centre of the slab due to ` stitching ' together the antiparallel textures in the slab and axial fill line .",
    "we do not calculate the texture associated with the vortex but include the superflow far from the axis by setting @xmath180 .",
    "[ fig1s](b ) shows how the texture is changed when the trapped vortex is removed .",
    "we have also tried removing the spontaneous superflow associated with the monodomain texture , but the difference this makes is hardly discernable .",
    "we have also calculated the textures with @xmath181 and found that this produces textures near the outer perimeter that are more symmetric when the direction of rotation is changed .",
    "we find that the @xmath175 and @xmath176 terms are responsible for producing the very different textures near the edge for the different directions of rotation and this leads to different gradients of @xmath165 with increasing @xmath71 , particularly near the fredericksz transition .",
    "the main effect of trapped vorticity is simply to shift the curves relative to each other .",
    "the corresponding @xmath182 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2s ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath183 for the texture with the trapped vortex look very similar to the observed frequency shifts .",
    "our conclusion is that only the combination of the trapped vortex and the different coupling between the non - uniform edge texture for the opposing directions of rotation can explain the distinctive features observed in our experiments .    99 a.p .",

    "<S> the `` @xmath71-loops '' ( like magnetization loops for type - ii superconductors ) thus show hysteresis in the measured to properties associated with vortex nucleation at finite @xmath93 @xcite ( see fig.[fig4](d ) ) . for @xmath76 mm ( 0.41 mm ) </S>",
    "<S> we found @xmath94mms@xmath56 ( 0.3mms@xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus interpret @xmath95 that decreases with increasing @xmath10 as @xmath96 as the critical velocity for vortex nucleation near the disks edge corners where the @xmath1-texture is severely distorted due to the boundary conditions at the walls @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these critical velocities are consistent with vortices having _ continuous _ cores , for which @xmath97mms@xmath56 @xcite , and not with those having _ singular _ cores with @xmath98mms@xmath56 @xcite ( @xmath99@xmath8 m is the dipole length above which the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are coupled ) .     in the 0.41 mm thick slab for a series of rotation sweeps with @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> solid ( open ) symbols are for increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the cartoons indicate how some vorticity is bound to the rim of the container.,width=302 ]    fast rotation with @xmath101 is expected to nucleate hyperbolic ( @xmath102 ) atc vortices , which when far from the rim will behave the same way as the previously discussed circular atc vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be the case for the 0.26 mm slab , where we observe similar @xmath71-loops albeit with reduced @xmath103 mm / s . </S>",
    "<S> the oriented texture still remained after rotation is stopped . </S>",
    "<S> however , the behavior for the 0.41 mm slab is very different : even though there are clear evidences of vortex nucleation above @xmath104mm / s ( @xmath105rad / s ) , the @xmath71-loops are still non - hysteretic ! only above @xmath106rad </S>",
    "<S> / s does the hysteresis gradually set in ( indicating that the nucleated vortices stay in the central cluster ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig4 ] shows changes in @xmath107 for a series of rotation sweeps to progressively higher @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 increases when @xmath108 but then begins to decrease when @xmath109 ( @xmath110mms@xmath56 ) is reached due to the creation of vorticity ( @xmath111 for this direction of rotation as well ) . if the rotation was slowed after reaching a maximum of 0.11rad / s as shown in fig.[fig4](a ) </S>",
    "<S> ( corresponding to introducing @xmath112 ) then there is no hysteresis at all . </S>",
    "<S> if the maximum angular velocity is now increased to 0.14rad / s ( fig.[fig4](b ) ) then there is some slight hysteresis during the final part of the deceleration . the next rotation ( fig.[fig4](c ) ) has a slightly higher @xmath75 consistent with @xmath113 being trapped from the previous rotation sweep . unlike vortices introduced by rotations in the original direction , @xmath114 , this vorticity is now strongly pinned @xcite , and can not be removed by gentle rotation in the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> it also seems that defects had been irreversibly introduced into the texture as the behavior for small @xmath71 @xmath115 was changed and no longer corresponded to the ones shown in fig.[fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> further rotation to higher angular velocities introduces more hysteresis ( fig.[fig4](c&d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that no hysteresis is seen just above @xmath109 means that vortices can be reversibly removed upon ( even small ) deceleration , which is extraordinary !    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a speculative scenario that the non - hysteretic vortex behavior results from vorticity that is bound to the disk s rim . </S>",
    "<S> this could occur when a crescent - shaped domain of @xmath54 is formed . </S>",
    "<S> its domain wall will have a reduced critical velocity for the nucleation of vortex kinks @xcite and can either become decorated with four vortex kinks and detach from the wall forming an individual @xmath102 atc vortex which will migrate towards the centre of the disk ( as apparently happens in the thinner slab ) , or it can stretch and become further decorated with vortex kinks forming a vortex sheet ( fig.[fig1](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ends of the vortex sheet will remain attached to the rim while the vortex kinks will be attracted towards the centre but this will be resisted by the tension of the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> the non - hysteretic behavior probably results from the nucleation of multiple vortex sheets , such a vortex configuration shows very little hysteresis in bulk @xmath0he - a  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sheets are able to shrink and disappear upon deceleration , until a second critical velocity ( @xmath116 rad / s ) is reached when certain domain walls and kinks remain after rotation is stopped , perhaps due to pinning . </S>",
    "<S> further rotations then show more hysteresis as the kinks are no longer bound to the rim and move towards the centre of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that , following the rotation , at @xmath71 well - above @xmath109 , in the direction opposite to that of @xmath117 the initially monodomain texture is permanently ruined ( as judged by the fredericksz transition ) also tells that domain walls have been introduced along with vortex nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be a natural process of gradual replacement of the metastable vortex state with hyperbolic vortices in @xmath118 texture by that with circular vortices in @xmath119 texture .    by breaking the time - reversal symmetry of the two competing ground states of chiral @xmath0he - a   by rotation at @xmath117 , </S>",
    "<S> we have created large monodomain samples of @xmath0he - a  in a slab geometry and , for the first time , determined their orientation @xmath1 as a function of the bias : @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this orientation is opposite to that expected from the interaction with the intrinsic orbital moment , but is due to the differences in the structures of vortex - skyrmions with opposite senses of circulation . </S>",
    "<S> it is hence the @xmath121 in the formula @xmath33 that explains that the lower - energy vortices with circular core ( @xmath35 ) are embedded into the @xmath14-texture oriented _ opposite _ to the sense of initial rotation . in chiral superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the inequivalence of energies of vortices with opposite senses of circulation @xcite , it might also be possible to create monodomain @xmath14-textures by a similar technique ( i.e. slow field - cooling into the vortex state in a substantial magnetic field up to @xmath122 ) ; this will result in @xmath123 orientation which is opposite to the one favored by field - cooling experiments with small fields @xmath124 @xcite .    </S>",
