    "surface - mediated processes , in which a particle randomly alternates between surface and bulk diffusions , are relevant for various chemical and biochemical processes such as reactions in porous media or trafficking in living cells @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown theoretically that intermittent dynamics between two diffusive phases can lead to faster kinetics .",
    "the kinetics was characterized by the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) of diffusing particles to a fixed reactant @xcite .    as a representative example of confined interfacial kinetics ,",
    "the case of a particle alternating bulk and surface diffusion over a sphere which contains a reactive cap , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the reactive cap can also be interpreted as a hole , in which case the mfpt is referred to as the mean exit time @xcite . while the desorption rate from the surface is independent of any geometrical parameter , the switching dynamics from the bulk to the surface is determined by the statistics of returns to the sphere .",
    "these statistics strongly depend on the boundary behavior of the process . after each desorption event , it was assumed in @xcite that the particle was ejected into the bulk at a distance @xmath0 that was required to avoid an immediate re - adsorption on the perfectly adsorbing sphere .",
    "a similar description was used in discrete square lattice versions of this model , in which the lattice spacing played the role of the cut - off distance @xmath1 @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the mfpt was found , under certain conditions , to be an optimizable function of the desorption rate .",
    "the favorable effect of desorptions was attributed in @xcite to the fact that bulk excursions reduce the time wasted due to the recurrence of surface brownian motion , by bringing particles through the bulk to unvisited regions of the sphere .",
    "previous mean - field treatments which ignored spatial correlations , missed this possible optimum @xcite . in the case of a",
    "uniformly semi - reflecting sphere , _ including the target _ , the mfpt was also found to be an optimizable function of the desorption rate even for a distance of ejection @xmath1 set to zero @xcite .",
    "recently , a coarse - grained approach to the surface - mediated search for a perfectly adsorbing target in an otherwise semi - reflecting sphere was considered in @xcite .",
    "this model is relevant in numerous real situations in which the particle reactivity with the target is not related to its affinity with the rest of the surface , as it is obviously the case in particular for exit problems .",
    "relying on an elegant first order kinetics scheme , concise approximate expressions were proposed in @xcite for the spatially averaged mfpts ( called here global mfpts and denoted gmfpts ) for a uniform distribution of starting points over either the sphere surface or the bulk .",
    "these averages will be called hereafter surface and bulk gmfpts .",
    "this approach , which treats the bulk and surface diffusive phases as two effective states coupled by first order kinetic equations , led to a monotonic gmfpt as a function of the desorption rate .",
    "this striking difference with ref .",
    "@xcite was attributed in @xcite to the non - locality of the desorption process , in which the instantaneous ejection at a non zero distance @xmath1 implied a violation of the detailed balance condition .    in this article",
    "we clarify this puzzling situation and address the question of the optimality of the gmfpts as a function of the desorption rate for the mixed boundary condition of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , ( i ) we provide an exact solution for the mfpt ; ( ii ) we prove that the surface gmfpt can still be optimized with respect to the desorption rate , under analytically determined criteria ; ( iii ) we compare our results with the coarse - grained approach of @xcite , which is shown to be accurate only in a limited region of the parameter space .     containing a perfectly adsorbing cap ( a target ) . for finite values of @xmath2 , particles ( represented as small spheres ) diffusing in the bulk randomly",
    "bind to or bounce from the remaining ( non - adsorbing ) part of the sphere surface ( outside the target cap ) .",
    "the target is reached either from the bulk ( shown by the green particle ) , or from the surface ( shown by the blue particle).,width=188 ]",
    "we consider particles diffusing in a three - dimensional spherical cavity of radius @xmath3 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : model ] ) switching between phases of surface diffusion with diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and phases of bulk diffusion with diffusion coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "the time spent on the surface is assumed to follow an exponential law with desorption rate @xmath6 .",
    "the target is a cap defined as the portion of the sphere @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the elevation angle in spherical coordinates .",
    "the target is considered as perfectly reactive , i.e. particles react as soon as they encounter the target for the first time .",
    "we will focus here on the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) on the target .",
    "the surface gmfpt @xmath9 is defined here as the average of the mfpt over a uniform distribution of the starting points on the sphere surface , _ including the target_. in turn , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mfpt was averaged over the starting points outside the target ; we denote this average as @xmath10}$ ] .",
    "the two averages are related by @xmath11}$ ] , where @xmath12 is a geometrical factor which is written as @xmath13    the non - reactive part of the sphere is considered as semi - reflecting : a particle reaching by bulk diffusion the non - reactive part of the sphere surface gets randomly either adsorbed or reflected back in the bulk .",
    "the probability for binding to the surface is an increasing function of the adsorption coefficient @xmath2 , which will be precisely defined through the radiative boundary condition for the mfpt in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcreflective ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 ( resp .",

    "notice that the model that we consider here is exactly the same as in @xcite .    the limits @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to simple situations . in the case",
    "@xmath18 , particles are trapped on the surface until they reach the target , and the exact expression for the surface gmfpt is @xcite : @xmath19 the limit @xmath20 is equivalent to a purely reflecting boundary . the asymptotic behavior for the narrow escape limit @xmath21 is given in @xcite : @xmath22 notice that the bulk and surface gmfpts diverge as @xmath23 tends to zero , as it can be seen in particular in the above limits .",
    "indeed a point - like target ( @xmath24 ) is detectable neither by bulk ( 3d ) excursions nor by surface ( 2d ) diffusion .",
    "using a standard formalism of backward equations @xcite , we derive the diffusive equations ( [ eq : temps1],[eq : temps2 ] ) and the appropriate boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcadsorb],[eq : bcreflective ] ) satisfied by the mfpt , which we proceed to solve in the next section .",

    "the mfpts are expressed in terms of the conditional probabilities through the relations @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 .    substituting the latter relations ( [ def : t1 ] ) and ( [ def : t2 ] ) into eqs .",
