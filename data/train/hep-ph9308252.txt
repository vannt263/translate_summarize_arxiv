    "by including the gallex ii data @xcite , we update our previous msw analysis @xcite which includes a joint @xmath0 analysis of all experiments , a full treatment of theoretical uncertainties including correlations between experiments , and the earth effect .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "the experimental data used in the analysis are summarized in table [ tab_expdata ] .",
    "the combined result of the homestake @xcite , gallium @xcite , and kamiokande ( including the day - night data ) @xcite experiments are shown in fig .  [ fig_daynight ] .",
    "the allowed large - angle region for @xmath1 has been reduced significantly by including the new gallex result . the allowed regions with respect to the global minimum .",
    "this prescription is only rigorously valid when the probability distribution in the parameter space is gaussian around the global minimum .",
    "improved treatments will be discussed in a subsequent paper @xcite . ] at 90 , 95 , and 99% c.l .",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cls ] ; there is a third allowed solution in the large - angle region at 99% c.l for @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_earth ] we show the combined result including the earth effect , but without the kamiokande day - night data .",
    "when the solar neutrino data are fit to a general solar model @xcite , using the @xmath3 , cno , @xmath4be , and @xmath5b fluxes as free parameters with the luminosity constraint imposed , the best fit value requires @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but with a large @xmath0 ( = 5.1 for 1 degrees of freedom ) ; this solution is excluded at 98% c.l .",
    "in the msw analysis it is important to include the standard solar model ( ssm ) flux uncertainties properly , since their magnitudes are comparable to the experimental uncertainties and also strongly correlated from experiment to experiment .",
    "one way to incorporate those ssm uncertainties is to carry out monte carlo simulations , as done by bahcall and haxton @xcite , which is robust but time consuming .",
    "alternatively , we parameterize the flux uncertainties with the uncertainties of the central temperature and of the the relevant nuclear reaction cross sections .",
    "this method was , however , questioned by bahcall on the grounds that this simplification might fail in estimating the uncertainties accurately @xcite .",
    "we have numerically compared the two methods and conclude that they yields almost identical results @xcite .",
    "first we have compared the uncertainties of the major fluxes ( @xmath3 , @xmath4be , and @xmath5b ) and their correlations .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab_magnitudes ] for the magnitudes and table  [ tab_correlations ] for the correlations .",
    "the results are also graphically shown in fig .  [ fig_beb ] .",
    "the numerical results show that the parameterization method accurately reproduces the monte - carlo flux uncertainties .",
    "we have also carried out the comparison for the uncertainties of the rate predictions for the experiments .",
    "the magnitudes and the correlations of the uncertainties are compared in table  [ tab_exp_magnitudes ] and table  [ tab_exp_correlations ] , respectively .",
    "again the agreement is excellent .",
