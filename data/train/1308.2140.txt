    "in recent years , there has been an ever - increasing research activity in the study of real - world complex networks  @xcite ( the world - wide web , the autonomous - systems graph within the internet , coauthorship graphs , phone - call graphs , email graphs and biological networks , to cite but a few ) .",
    "these networks , typically generated directly or indirectly by human activity and interaction ( and therefore hereafter dubbed `` social '' ) , appear in a large variety of contexts and often exhibit a surprisingly similar structure .",
    "one of the most important notions that researchers have been trying to capture in such networks is `` node centrality '' : ideally , every node ( often representing an individual ) has some degree of influence or importance within the social domain under consideration , and one expects such importance to surface in the structure of the social network ; centrality is a quantitative measure that aims at revealing the importance of a node .    among the types of centrality that have been considered in the literature ( see  @xcite for a good survey ) , many have to do with distances between nodes .",
    "take , for instance , a node in an undirected connected network : if the sum of distances to all other nodes is large , the node under consideration is _ peripheral _ ; this is the starting point to define bavelas s _ closeness centrality _",
    "@xcite , which is the reciprocal of peripherality ( i.e. , the reciprocal of the sum of distances to all other nodes ) .",
    "the role played by shortest paths is justified by one of the most well - known features of complex networks , the so - called _ small - world _ phenomenon .",
    "a small - world network  @xcite is a graph where the average distance between nodes is logarithmic in the size of the network , whereas the clustering coefficient is larger ( that is , neighborhoods tend to be denser ) than in a random erds - rnyi graph with the same size and average distance .",
    "the fact that social networks ( whether electronically mediated or not ) exhibit the small - world property is known at least since milgram s famous experiment  @xcite and is arguably the most popular of all features of complex networks . for instance , the average distance of the facebook graph was recently established to be just @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to pave the way for a formal well - grounded assessment of centrality measures , based on some simple guiding principles ; we seek notions of centrality that are at the same time _",
    "( they should be applicable to arbitrary directed graphs , possibly non - connected , without modifications ) and _ understandable _ ( they should have a clear combinatorial interpretation ) .    with these principles in mind ,",
    "we shall present and compare the most popular and well - known centrality measures proposed in the last decades .",
    "the comparison will be based on a set of _ axioms _ , each trying to capture a specific trait .    in the last part of the paper , as a sanity check",
    ", we compare the measures we discuss in an information - retrieval setting , extracting from the classic gov2 web collection documents satisfying a query and ranking by centrality the subgraph of retrieved documents .",
    "the results are somehow surprising , and suggest that simple measures based on distances , and in particular _ harmonic centrality _ ( which we introduce formally in this paper ) can give better results than some of the most sophisticated indices used in the literature .",
    "these unexpected outcomes are the main contribution of this paper , together with the set of axiom we propose , which provide a conceptual framework for understanding centrality measures in a formal way .",
    "we also try to give an orderly account of centrality in social and network sciences , gathering scattered results and folklore knowledge in a systematic way .",
    "in this section , we sketch the historical development of centrality , focusing on ten classical centrality measures that we decided to include in this paper : the overall growth of the field is of course much more complex , and the literature contains a myriad of alternative proposals that will not be discussed here .    centrality is a fundamental tool in the study of social networks : the first efforts to define formally centrality indices were put forth in the late 1940s by the group networks laboratory at mit  directed by alex bavelas  @xcite , in the framework of communication patterns and group collaboration  @xcite ; those pioneering experiments concluded that centrality was related to group efficiency in problem - solving , and agreed with the subjects perception of leadership . in the following decades ,",
    "various measures of centrality were employed in a multitude of contexts ( to understand political integration in indian social life  @xcite , to examine the consequences of centrality in communication paths for urban development  @xcite , to analyze their implications to the efficient design of organizations  @xcite , or even to explain the wealth of the medici family based on their central position with respect to marriages and financial transactions in the 15th century florence  @xcite ) .",
    "we can certainly say that the problem of singling out influential individuals in a social group is a holy grail that sociologists have been trying to capture for at least sixty years .    although all researchers agree that centrality is an important structural attribute of social networks and that it is directly related to other important group properties and processes , there is no consensus on _ what _ centrality is exactly or on its conceptual foundations , and there is very little agreement on the proper procedures for its measurement  @xcite .",
    "it is true that often different centrality indices are designed to capture different properties of the network under observation , but as freeman observed , `` several measures are often only vaguely related to the intuitive ideas they purport to index , and many are so complex that it is difficult or impossible to discover what , if anything , they are measuring ''  @xcite .",
    "freeman acutely remarks that the implicit starting point of all centrality measures is the same : the central node of a star should be deemed more important than the other vertices ; paradoxically , it is precisely the unanimous agreement on this requirement that may have produced quite different approaches to the problem . in fact , the center of a star is at the same time    1 .   the node with largest degree ; 2 .",
    "the node that is closest to the other nodes ( e.g. , that has the smallest average distance to other nodes ) ; 3 .",
    "the node through which most shortest paths pass ; 4 .",
    "the node with the largest number of incoming paths of length @xmath1 , for every @xmath1 ; 5 .",
    "the node that maximizes the dominant eigenvector of the graph matrix ; 6 .   the node with the highest probability in the stationary distribution of the natural random walk on the graph .",
    "these observations lead to corresponding ( competing ) views of centrality .",
    "degree is probably the oldest measure of importance ever used , being equivalent to majority voting in elections ( where @xmath2 is interpreted as `` @xmath3 voted for @xmath4 '' ) .",
    "the most classical notion of _ closeness _ , instead , was introduced by bavelas  @xcite for undirected , connected networks as the reciprocal of the sum of distances from a given node .",
    "closeness was originally aimed at establishing how much a vertex can communicate without relying on third parties for his messages to be delivered . in the seventies ,",
    "nan lin proposed to adjust the definition of closeness so to make it usable on directed networks that are not necessarily strongly connected  @xcite .",
    "centrality indices based on the count of shortest paths were formally developed independently by anthonisse  @xcite and freeman  @xcite , who introduced _",
    "betweenness _ as a measure of the probability that a random shortest path passes through a given node or edge .",
    "katz s index  @xcite is based instead on a weighted count of _ all _ paths coming into a node : more precisely , the weight of a path of length @xmath5 is @xmath6 , for some _ attenuation factor _ @xmath7 , and the score of @xmath3 is the sum of the weights of all paths coming into @xmath3 . of course , @xmath7 must be chosen so that all the summations converge .    while the above notions of centrality are combinatorial in nature and based on the discrete structure of the underlying graph , another line of research studies _ spectral _ techniques ( in the sense of linear algebra ) to define centrality  @xcite .",
    "the earliest known proposal of this kind is due to seeley  @xcite , who normalized the rows of an adjacency matrix representing the `` i like him '' relations among a group of children , and assigned a centrality score using the resulting left dominant eigenvector .",
    "this approach is equivalent to studying the stationary distribution of the markov chain defined by the natural random walk on the graph .",
    "few years later , wei  @xcite proposed to rank sport teams using the right dominant eigenvector of a tournament matrix , which contains 1 or 0 depending on whether a team defeated another team .",
    "wei s work was then popularized by kendall  @xcite , and the technique is known in the literature about ranking of sport teams as `` kendall  wei ranking '' .",
    "building on wei s approach , berge  @xcite generalized the usage of dominant eigenvectors to arbitrary directed graphs , and in particular to _ sociograms _ , in which an arc represents a relationship of influence between two individuals .",
    "curiously enough , the most famous among spectral centrality scores is also one of the most recent , pagerank  @xcite : pagerank was a centrality measure specifically geared toward web graphs , and it was introduced precisely with the aim of implementing it in a search engine ( specifically , google , that the inventors of pagerank founded in 1997 ) .    in the same span of years ,",
    "jon kleinberg defined another centrality measure called hits  @xcite ( for `` hyperlink - induced topic search '' ) .",
    "the idea is that every node of a graph is associated with two importance indices : one ( called `` authority score '' ) measures how reliable ( important , authoritative  ) a node is , and another ( called `` hub score '' ) measures how good the node is in pointing to authoritative nodes , with the two scores mutually reinforcing each other .",
    "the result is again the dominant eigenvector of a suitable matrix .",
    "salsa  @xcite is a more recent and strictly related score based on the same idea , with the difference that it applies some normalization to the matrix .",
    "we conclude this brief historical account mentioning that there were in the past some attempts to axiomatize the notion of centrality : we postpone a discussion on these attempts to section  [ sec : histax ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider directed graphs defined by a set @xmath8 of @xmath9 nodes and a set @xmath10 of arcs ; we write @xmath2 when @xmath11 and call @xmath3 and @xmath4 the source and target of the arc , respectively .",
    "an arc with the same source and target is called a _",
    "loop_.    the _ transpose _ of a graph is obtained by reversing all arc directions ( i.e. , it has an arc @xmath12 for every arc @xmath2 of the original graph ) .",
    "symmetric graph _ is a graph such that @xmath2 whenever @xmath12 ; such a graph is fixed by transposition , and can be identified with an undirected graph , that is , a graph whose arcs ( usually called _ edges _ ) are a subset of unordered pairs of nodes .",
    "successor _ of @xmath3 is a node @xmath4 such that @xmath2 , and a _ predecessor _ of @xmath3 is a node @xmath4 such that @xmath12 .",
    "the _ outdegree _",
    "@xmath13 of a node @xmath3 is the number of its successors , and the _ indegree _",
    "@xmath14 is the number of its predecessors .",
    "a _ path _ ( of length @xmath1 ) is a sequence xk , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "a _ walk _ ( of length @xmath1 ) is a sequence xk , where @xmath15 or @xmath17 , @xmath16",
    ". a connected ( strongly connected , respectively ) _ component _ of a graph is a maximal subset in which every pair of nodes is connected by a walk ( path , respectively ) .",
    "components form a partition of the nodes of a graph .",
    "a graph is _ ( strongly ) connected _ if there is a single ( strongly ) connected component , that is , for every choice of @xmath3 and @xmath4 there is a walk ( path ) from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "a strongly connected component is _ terminal _ if its nodes have no arc towards other components .",
    "the _ distance _",
    "@xmath18 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is the length of a shortest path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , or @xmath19 if no such path exists .",
    "the nodes _ reachable _ from @xmath3 are the nodes @xmath4 such that @xmath20 .",
    "the nodes _ coreachable _ from @xmath3 are the nodes @xmath4 such that @xmath21 .",
    "a node has _ trivial _",
    "( co)reachable set if the latter contains only the node itself .",
    "the notation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a nonnegative matrix , will be used throughout the paper to denote the matrix obtained by @xmath24-normalizing the rows of @xmath23 , that is , dividing each element of a row by the sum of the row ( null rows are left unchanged ) .",
    "if there are no null rows , @xmath22 is ( row-)_stochastic _ , that is , it is nonnegative and the row sums are all equal to one .",
    "we use iverson s notation : if @xmath25 is a predicate , @xmath26 $ ] has value @xmath27 if @xmath25 is false and @xmath28 if @xmath25 is true  @xcite ; we denote with @xmath29 the @xmath30-th harmonic number @xmath31 ; finally , @xmath32 $ ] is the characteristic vector of @xmath30 .",
    "we number graph nodes and corresponding vector coordinates starting from zero .",
    "we call _ geometric _ those measures assuming that importance is a function of distances ; more precisely , a geometric centrality depends only on how many nodes exist at every distance .",
    "these are some of the oldest measures defined in the literature .",
    "indegree , the number of incoming arcs @xmath14 , can be considered a geometric measure : it is simply the number of nodes at distance one .",
    "it is probably the oldest measure of importance ever used , as it is equivalent to majority voting in elections ( where @xmath2 if @xmath3 voted for @xmath4 ) .",
    "indegree has a number of obvious shortcomings ( e.g. , it is easy to spam ) , but it is a good baseline , and in some cases turned out to provide better results than more sophisticated methods ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "bavelas introduced closeness in the late forties  @xcite ; the closeness of @xmath3 is defined by @xmath33 the intuition behind closeness is that nodes that are more central have smaller distances , and thus a smaller denominator , resulting in a larger centrality .",
    "we remark that for this definition to make sense , the graph must be strongly connected . lacking that condition ,",
    "some of the denominators will be @xmath19 , resulting in a null score for all nodes that can not coreach the whole graph .",
    "it was probably not in bavelas s intentions to apply the measure to directed graphs , and even less to graphs with infinite distances , but nonetheless closeness is sometimes `` patched '' by simply not including unreachable nodes , that is , @xmath34 and assuming that nodes with an empty coreachable set have centrality @xmath27 by definition : this is actually the definition we shall use in the rest of the paper .",
    "these apparently innocuous adjustments , however , introduce a strong bias toward nodes with a small coreachable set .",
    "nan lin  @xcite tried to repair the definition of closeness for graphs with infinite distances by weighting closeness using the square of the number of coreachable nodes ; his definition for the centrality of a node @xmath3 with a nonempty coreachable set is @xmath35 the rationale behind this definition is the following : first , we consider closeness not the inverse of a sum of distances , but rather the inverse of the _ average _ distance , which entails a first multiplication by the number of coreachable nodes .",
    "this change normalizes closeness across the graph .",
    "now , however , we want nodes with a larger coreachable set to be more important , given that the average distance is the same , so we multiply again by the number of coreachable nodes .",
    "nodes with an empty coreachable set have centrality @xmath28 by definition .",
    "lin s index was ( somewhat surprisingly ) ignored in the following literature .",
    "nonetheless , it seems to provide a reasonable solution for the problems caused by the definition of closeness .      as we noticed",
    ", the main problem of closeness lies in the presence of pairs of unreachable nodes .",
    "we thus get inspiration from marchiori and latora  @xcite : faced with the problem of providing a sensible notion of `` average shortest path '' for a generic directed network , they propose to replace the average distance with the _ harmonic mean of all distances _",
    "( i.e. , the @xmath36 distances between every pair of distinct nodes ) .",
    "indeed , in case a large number of pairs of nodes are not reachable , the average of finite distances can be misleading : a graph might have a very low average distance while it is almost completely disconnected ( e.g. , a perfect matching has average distance @xmath37 ) .",
    "the harmonic mean has the useful property of handling @xmath19 cleanly ( assuming , of course , that @xmath38 ) .",
    "for example , the harmonic mean of distances of a perfect matching is @xmath39 : in fact , for every node there is exactly another node at a non - infinite distance , and its distance is 1 ; so the sum of the inverse of all distances is @xmath9 , making the harmonic average equal to @xmath40 .    in general",
    ", for each graph - theoretical notion based on arithmetic averaging or maximization there is an equivalent notion based on the harmonic mean .",
    "if we consider closeness the reciprocal of a denormalized average of distances , it is natural to consider also the reciprocal of a denormalized harmonic mean of distances .",
    "we thus define the _ harmonic centrality _ of @xmath3 as @xmath41 the difference with  ( [ eq : closeness ] ) might seem minor , but actually it is a radical change .",
    "harmonic centrality is strongly correlated to closeness centrality in simple networks , but naturally also accounts for nodes @xmath4 that can not reach @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it can be fruitfully applied to graphs that are not strongly connected .      _ spectral measures _ compute the left dominant eigenvector of some matrix derived from the graph , and depending on how the matrix is modified before the computation we can obtain a number of different measures .",
    "existence and uniqueness of such measures is usually derivable by the theory of nonnegative matrices started by perron and frobenius  @xcite ; we will not , however , discuss such issues , as there is a large body of established literature about the topic .",
    "all observations in this section are true for strongly connected graphs ; the modifications for graphs that are not strongly connected can be found in the cited references .      the first and most obvious spectral measure is the left dominant eigenvector of the plain adjacency matrix .",
    "indeed , the dominant eigenvector can be thought as the fixed point of an iterated computation in which every node starts with the same score , and then replaces its score with the sum of the scores of its predecessors .",
    "the vector is then normalized , and the process repeated until convergence .",
    "dominant eigenvectors fail to behave as expected on graphs that are not strongly connected . depending on the dominant eigenvalue of the strongly connected components , the dominant eigenvector might or might not be nonzero on non - terminal components ( a detailed characterization can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant eigenvector rationale can be slightly amended with the observation that the update rule we described can be thought of as if each node gives away its score to its successors : or even that each node has a _ reputation _ and is giving its reputation to its successors so that they can build their own .",
    "once we take this viewpoint , it is clear that it is not very sensible to give away our own amount of reputation to everybody : it is more reasonable to _ divide _ equally our reputation among our successors . from a linear - algebra viewpoint",
    ", this corresponds to normalizing each row of the adjacency matrix using the @xmath24 norm .",
    "seeley advocated this approach  @xcite for computing the popularity among groups of children , given a graph representing whether each child liked or not another one .",
    "the matrix resulting from the @xmath24-normalization process is stochastic , so the score can be interpreted as the stationary state of a markov chain . in particular ,",
    "if the underlying graph is symmetric then seeley s index collapses to degree ( modulo normalization ) because of the well - known characterization of the stationary distribution of the natural random walk on a symmetric graph .",
    "also seeley s index does not react very well to the lack of strong connectivity : the only nodes with a nonzero score are those belonging to terminal components that are not formed by a single node of outdegree zero .",
    "katz introduced his celebrated index  @xcite using a summation over all paths coming into a node , but weighting each path so that the summation would be finite .",
    "katz s index can be expressed as @xmath42 due to the interplay between the powers of the adjacency matrix and the number of paths connecting two nodes . for the summation above to be finite , the _ attenuation factor _",
    "@xmath7 must be smaller than @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dominant eigenvalue of @xmath23 .",
    "katz immediately noted that the index was expressible using linear algebra operations : @xmath45 it took some more time to realize that , due to brauer s theorem on the displacement of eigenvalues  @xcite , katz s index is the left dominant eigenvector of a _ perturbed matrix _ @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a right dominant eigenvector of @xmath23 such that @xmath48  @xcite . an easy generalization ( actually suggested by hubbell  @xcite )",
    "replaces the vector @xmath49 with some preference vector @xmath50 so that paths are also weighted differently depending on their starting node .. this additional multiplication by @xmath23 is somewhat common in the literature , even for pagerank ; clearly , it alters the order induced by the scores only when there is a nonuniform preference vector .",
    "our discussion can be easily adapted for this version . ]",
    "the normalized limit of katz s index when @xmath51 is a dominant eigenvector ; if the dominant eigenvector is not unique , the limit depends on the preference vector @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "pagerank is one of the most discussed and quoted spectral indices in use today , mainly because of its alleged use in google s ranking algorithm . by definition , pagerank is the unique vector @xmath52 satisfying @xmath53 where @xmath22 is again the @xmath24-normalized adjacency matrix of the graph , @xmath54 is a _ damping factor _ , and @xmath50 is a _ preference vector _ ( which must be a distribution ) .",
    "this is the definition appearing in brin and page s paper about google  @xcite ; the authors claim that the pagerank score is a probability distribution over web pages , that is , it has unit @xmath24 norm , but this is not necessarily true if @xmath23 has null rows .",
    "the following scientific literature thus proposed several ways to _ patch _ the matrix @xmath22 to make it stochastic , which would guarantee @xmath55 .",
    "a common solution is to replace every null row with the preference vector @xmath50 itself , but other solutions have been proposed ( e.g. , adding a loop to all nodes of outdegree zero ) , leading to different scores .",
    "this issue is definitely not academic , as in typical web snapshots a significant fraction of the nodes have outdegree zero ( the so - called _ dangling nodes _ ) .",
    "it is interested to note , however , that in the preprint written in collaboration with motwani and winograd and commonly quoted as defining pagerank  @xcite , brin and page themselves propose a different but essentially equivalent linear recurrence in the style of hubbell s index  @xcite , and acknowledge that @xmath22 can have null rows , in which case the dominant eigenvalue of @xmath22 could be smaller than one , and the solution might need to be normalized to have unit @xmath24 norm .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : prlin ] ) is of course solvable even without any patching , giving @xmath56 and finally @xmath57 which shows immediately that katz s index and pagerank differ only by a constant factor and by the @xmath24 normalization applied to @xmath23 , similarly to the difference between the dominant eigenvector and seeley s index .",
    "if @xmath23 has no null rows , or @xmath22 has been patched to be stochastic , pagerank can be equivalently defined as the stationary distribution ( i.e. , the left dominant eigenvector ) of the markov chain with transition matrix @xmath58 which is of course analogous to  ( [ eq : katzpert ] ) .",
    "del corso , gull and romani  @xcite have shown that the resulting scores ( which have always unit @xmath24 norm ) differ from the pagerank vector defined by  ( [ eq : prlin ] ) only by a normalization factor , provided that in  ( [ eq : prmarkov ] ) null rows have been replaced with @xmath50 . if @xmath23 had no null rows , the scores are of course identical as  ( [ eq : prinv ] ) can be easily derived from  ( [ eq : prmarkov ] ) .",
    "both definitions have been used in the literature : the linear - recurrence definition  ( [ eq : prlin ] ) is particularly useful when one needs linear dependence on @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the markov - chain definition  ( [ eq : prmarkov ] ) is nonetheless more common , albeit it raises the issue of patching null rows .",
    "analogously to what happens with katz s index , if the dominant eigenvalue of @xmath22 is one then the limit of pagerank when @xmath59 goes to 1 is a dominant eigenvector of @xmath22 , that is , seeley s index , and if the dominant eigenvector is not unique the limit depends on the preference vector @xmath60  @xcite .    in the rest of this paper , except when explicitly stated , we shall define pagerank as in equation ( [ eq : prinv ] ) , without any patching or normalization , and use a uniform preference vector .",
    "kleinberg introduced his celebrated hits algorithm  @xcite using the web metaphor of `` mutual reinforcement '' : a page is authoritative if it is pointed by many good _ hubs_pages which contain good list of authoritative pages , and a hub is good if it points to authoritative pages .",
    "this suggests an iterative process that computes at the same time an authoritativeness score @xmath61 and a `` hubbiness '' score @xmath62 starting with @xmath63 , and then applying the update rule @xmath64 this process converges to the left dominant eigenvector of the matrix @xmath65 , which gives the final authoritativeness score , and that we label with `` hits '' throughout the paper .. ]    inverting the process , and considering the left dominant eigenvector of the matrix @xmath66 , gives the final hubbiness score .",
    "the two vectors are the left and right _ singular vectors _ associated with the largest _ singular value _ in the singular - value decomposition of @xmath23 .",
    "note also that hubbiness is the positive version of authoritativeness .      finally , we consider salsa , a measure introduced by lempel and moran  @xcite always using the metaphor of mutual reinforcement between authoritativeness and hubbiness , but @xmath24-normalizing the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath67 . we start with @xmath63 and proceed with @xmath68 we remark that this normalization process is analogous to the one that brings us from the dominant eigenvector to seeley s index , or from katz s index to pagerank .",
    "similarly to what happens with seeley s index on symmetric graphs , salsa does not need such an iterative process to be computed .",
    "first , one computes the connected components of the symmetric graph induced by the matrix @xmath65 ; in this graph , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are adjacent if @xmath3 and @xmath4 have some common predecessor in the original graph .",
    "then , the salsa score of a node is the ratio between its indegree and the sum of the indegrees of nodes in the same component , multiplied by the ratio between the component size and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , contrarily to hits , a single linear scan of the graph is sufficient to compute salsa , albeit the computation of the intersection graph requires time proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "path - based measures exploit not only the existence of shortest paths but actually take into examination all shortest paths ( or all paths ) coming into a node .",
    "we remark that indegree can be considered a path - based measure , as it is the equivalent to the number of incoming paths of length one .",
    "_ betweenness centrality _ was introduced by anthonisse  @xcite for edges , and then rephrased by freeman for nodes  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to measure the probability that a random shortest path passes through a given node : if @xmath70 is the number of shortest paths going from @xmath4 to @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the number of such paths that pass through @xmath3 , we define the _ betweenness _ of @xmath3 as @xmath73 the intuition behind betweenness is that if a large fraction of shortest paths passes through @xmath3 , then @xmath3 is an important junction point of the network .",
    "indeed , removing nodes in betweenness order causes a very quick disruption of the network  @xcite .",
    "it is a general observation that all spectral measures can be interpreted as path - based measures as they depend on taking the limit of some summations of powers of @xmath23 , or on the limit of powers of @xmath23 , and in both cases we can express these algebraic operations in terms of suitable paths .",
    "for instance , the left dominant eigenvector of a nonnegative matrix can be computed with the power method by taking the limit of @xmath74 for @xmath75 . since , however , @xmath76 is a vector associating with each node the number of paths of length @xmath1 coming into the node , we can see that dominant eigenvector expresses the relative growth of the number of paths coming into each node as their length increases .",
    "analogously , seeley s index can be computed ( modulo a normalization factor ) by taking the limit of @xmath77 ( in this case , the @xmath24 norm can not grow , so we do not need to renormalize at each iteration ) .",
    "the vector @xmath77 has the following combinatorial interpretation : it assigns to each @xmath3 the sums of the _ weights _ of the paths coming into @xmath3 , where the weight of a path @xmath78 ,  @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 is @xmath82    when we switch to attenuated versions of the previous indices ( that is , katz s index and pagerank ) , we switch from limits to infinite summations and at the same time multiply the weight of paths of length @xmath5 by @xmath6 or @xmath83 . indeed ,",
    "the katz index of @xmath3 was originally defined as the summation over all @xmath5 of the number of paths of length @xmath5 coming into @xmath3 multiplied by @xmath6 , and pagerank is the summation over all paths coming into @xmath3 of the weight  ( [ eq : weight ] ) multiplied by @xmath83 .",
    "the reader can easily work out similar definitions for hits and salsa , which depend on a suitable definition of alternate `` back - and - forth path '' ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    "the comparative evaluation of centrality measures is a challenging , difficult , arduous task , for many different reasons .",
    "the datasets that are classically used in social sciences are very small ( typically , some tens of nodes ) , and it is hard to draw conclusions out of them . nonetheless , some attempts in this direction were put forth ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ; sometimes , the attitude was actually to provide evidence that different measures highlight different kinds of centralities and are , therefore , equally incomparably interesting  @xcite . whether the latter consideration is the only sensible conclusion or not is debatable . while it is clear that the notion of centrality , in its vagueness , can be interpreted differently giving rise to many good but incompatible measures , we will provide evidence that some measures tend to reward nodes that are in no way central .",
    "if results obtained on small corpora may be misleading , a comparison on larger corpora is much more difficult to deal with , due to the lack of ground truth and to the unavailability of implementations of efficient algorithms to compute the measures under consideration ( at least in cases where efficient , possibly approximate , algorithms do exist ) . among the few attempts that try a comparison on large networks we cite  @xcite and  @xcite , that nevertheless focus only on web graphs and on a very limited number of centrality indices .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to understand ( part of ) the behavior of a centrality measure using a set of axioms . while , of course , it is not sensible to prescribe a set of axioms that _ define _ what centrality should be ( in the vein of shannon s definition of entropy  @xcite or altman and tennenholtz axiomatic definition of seeley s index  @xcite ) , so they are actually formalizing seeley s venerable index  @xcite . ] ) , as different indices serve different purposes , it is reasonable to set up some _ necessary _ axioms that an index should satisfy to behave predictably and follow our intuition .",
    "the other interesting aspect of defining axioms is that , even if one does not believe they are really so discriminative or necessary , they provide a very specific , formal , provable piece of information about a centrality measure that is much more precise than folklore intuitions like `` this centrality is really correlated to indegree '' or `` this centrality is really fooled by cliques '' .",
    "we believe that a theory of centrality should provide exactly this kind of compact , meaningful , reusable information ( in the sense that it can be used to prove other properties ) .",
    "this is indeed what happens , for example , in topology , where the information that a space is @xmath84 , rather than @xmath85 , is a compact way to provide a lot of knowledge about the structure of the space .",
    "defining such axioms is a delicate matter .",
    "first of all , the semantics of the axioms must be very clear .",
    "second , the axioms must be evaluable in an exact way on the most common centrality measures .",
    "third , they should be formulated avoiding the trap of small , finite ( counter)examples , on which many centrality measures collapse ( e.g. , using an asymptotic definition as suggested by lempel and moran for rank _ similarity _ and _ stability _",
    "we assume from the beginning that the centrality measures under examination are invariant by isomorphism , that is , that they depend just on the structure of the graph , and not on particular labeling chosen for each node .",
    "to meet these constraints , we propose to study the reaction of centrality measures to _ change of size _ , to _ ( local ) change of density _ and to _",
    "arc additions_. we expect that nodes belonging to larger groups , when every other parameter is fixed , should be more important , and that nodes with a denser neighborhood ( i.e. , having more friends ) , when every other parameter is fixed , should also be more important . we also expect that adding an arc should increase the importance of the target .    how can we actually determine if this happens in an exact way , and possibly in an asymptotic setting ? to do so , we need to try something entirely new  evaluating _ exactly _",
    "( i.e. , in algebraic closed form ) all measures of interest on all nodes of some representative classes of networks",
    ". a good approach to reduce the amount of computation is using strongly connected _ _ vertex - transitive _ _ and @xmath4 there is an automorphism exchanging @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ]",
    "graphs as basic building blocks : these graphs exhibit a high degree of symmetry , which should entail a simplification of our computations . finally , since we want to compare density , a natural choice is to pick the _",
    "densest _ strongly connected vertex - transitive graph , the clique , and the _ sparsest _ strongly connected , the directed cycle . choosing two graphs at the extreme of the density spectrum",
    "should better highlight the reaction of centrality measures to density .",
    "moreover , @xmath1-cliques and directed @xmath86-cycles exist for every @xmath1 and @xmath86 ( this might not happen for more complicated structures , e.g. , a cubic graph ) .",
    "let us consider a graph made by a @xmath1-clique and a @xmath86-cycle ( see the figure in table  [ tab : cliquecycle ] ) .",
    "because of invariance by isomorphism , all nodes of the clique have equal score , and all nodes of the cycle have equal score , too ; but which nodes are more important ? probably everybody would answer that if @xmath87 the elements on the clique are more important , and indeed this axiom is so trivial that is satisfied by almost any measure of which we are aware , but we are interested in assessing the sensitivity to _ size _ , and thus we state our first axiom as follows :    [ def : size ] consider the graph @xmath88 made by a @xmath1-clique and a directed @xmath86-cycle ( table  [ tab : cliquecycle ] ) .",
    "a centrality measure satisfies the _ size axiom _ if for every @xmath1 there is a @xmath89 such that for all @xmath90 in @xmath88 the centrality of a node of the @xmath86-cycle is strictly larger than the centrality of a node of the @xmath1-clique , and if for every @xmath86 there is a @xmath91 such that for all @xmath92 in @xmath88 the centrality of a node of the @xmath1-clique is strictly larger than the centrality of a node of the @xmath86-cycle .    intuitively , when @xmath87 we do expect nodes of the cycle to be less important than nodes of the clique .",
    "the rationale behind the case @xmath93 is rather clear : the denser community is also getting larger , and thus its members are expected to become ultimately even more important .    on the other hand , if the cycle becomes very large ( more precisely , when its size goes to infinity ) , its nodes are still part of a very large ( albeit badly connected ) community , and we expect them to achieve ultimately greater importance than the nodes of a fixed - size community , no matter how dense it can be .    since one might devise some centrality measures that satisfy the size axiom for @xmath86 and not for @xmath1 , stating both properties in definition  [ def : size ] gives us a finer granularity and avoids pathological cases .",
    "designing an axiom for density is a more delicate issue , since we must be able to define an increase of density `` with all other parameters fixed '' , including size .",
    "let us start ideally from a graph made by a directed @xmath1-cycle and a directed @xmath86-cycle , and connect a node @xmath3 of the @xmath1-cycle with a node @xmath4 of the @xmath86-cycle through a bidirectional arc , the _",
    "bridge_. if @xmath94 , the vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 are symmetric , and thus must necessarily have the same score .",
    "now , we increase the density of the @xmath1-cycle as much as possible , turning it into a @xmath1-clique ( see the figure in table  [ tab : cliquecyclexyyx ] ) . note that this change of density is local to @xmath3 , as the degree of @xmath4 has not changed .",
    "we are thus _ strictly increasing the local density around @xmath3 , leaving all other parameters fixed _ , and in these circumstances we expect that the score of @xmath3 increases .",
    "[ def : density ] consider the graph @xmath95 made by a @xmath1-clique and a @xmath86-cycle ( @xmath96 ) connected by a bidirectional bridge @xmath97 , where @xmath3 is a node of the clique and @xmath4 is a node of the cycle ( table  [ tab : cliquecyclexyyx ] ) .",
    "a centrality measure satisfies the _ density axiom _ if for @xmath94 the centrality of @xmath3 is strictly larger than the centrality of @xmath4 .    note that our axiom does not specify any constraint when @xmath98 . while studying the behavior of the graph @xmath95 of the previous definition when @xmath98 shades some lights of the inner behavior of centrality measures , it is essential , in an axiom asserting the sensitivity to density , that size is not involved .    in our proofs for the density axiom ,",
    "we actually let @xmath1 and @xmath86 be independent parameters ( even if the axiom is stated for @xmath94 ) to compute the _ watershed _",
    ", that is , the value of @xmath1 ( expressed as a function of @xmath86 ) at which the centrality of @xmath3 becomes larger than the centrality of @xmath4 ( if any ) .",
    "the watershed can give some insight as to how badly a measure can miss satisfying the density axiom .",
    "finally , we propose an axiom that specifies strictly monotonic behavior upon the addition of an arc :    [ def : density1 ] a centrality measure satisfies the _ score - monotonicity axiom _ if for every graph @xmath99 and every pair of nodes @xmath3 , @xmath4 such that @xmath100 , when we add @xmath2 to @xmath99 the centrality of @xmath4 increases .    in some sense , this axiom is trivial : it is satisfied by essentially all centrality measures we consider _ on strongly connected graphs_. thus , it is an excellent test to verify that a measure is able to handle correctly partially disconnected graphs .",
    "the reader might be tempted to define a _ weak _ monotonicity axiom which just require the _ rank _ of @xmath4 to be nondecreasing .",
    "however , the centrality measure associating a constant value to every node of every network would satisfy such an axiom , which makes it not very interesting for our goals if used in isolation .",
    "nonetheless , a form of rank monotonicity would be an essential counterpoint to score monotonicity , as it would detect pathological centralities in which the addition of an arc towards @xmath4 does increase the score of @xmath4 , but also increase in a counterintuitive way the score of other nodes , resulting in a rank decrease of @xmath4 .",
    "we leave the statement and the study of such an axiom for future work .",
    "the idea of formalizing through axioms the behavior of centrality indices is not new : sabidussi , in his much - quoted paper on centrality  @xcite , describes in a section named `` axioms for centrality '' a set of axioms that should be satisfied by a sensible centrality on an undirected graph . indeed ,",
    "one of his conditions is identical to our score - monotonicity axiom ( see section  [ sec : mono ] ) .",
    "a few years later , nieminen  @xcite attempted a similar formalization for directed graphs .",
    "his axioms are only meaningful for geometric centralities as they are stated in term of the number of nodes at a given distance .",
    "consider the _ negative neighborhood function of @xmath3 in a graph @xmath99 _ defined by @xmath101 nieminen essentially states that if the neighborhood function of @xmath3 dominates strictly that of @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath102 for all @xmath5 and @xmath103 for at least one @xmath5 ) then the centrality of @xmath3 must be strictly larger than that of @xmath4 .",
    "since the new neighborhood function of @xmath4 after the addition of an arc towards @xmath4 always dominates strictly the old one , nieminen s axiom implies score monotonicity .",
    "he notes , indeed , that bavelas s centrality does not satisfy some of his axioms .",
    "the work of chien , dwork , kumar , simon and sivakumar  @xcite , albeit targeted exclusively at pagerank , contains a definition of score monotonicity equivalent to ours ( and sabidussi s ) and a definition of rank monotonicity that we think captures the essence of the problem : when we add an arc towards @xmath4 , nodes with a score smaller than @xmath4 must continue to have a score smaller that of @xmath4 , while nodes with a score equal to @xmath4 must get a score that is smaller than or equal to that of @xmath4 .",
    "sabidussi s paper tries to capture rank monotonicity , too , but with much weaker requirements : he requires that if @xmath4 has maximum score in the network , then it should have maximum score also after the addition of an arc towards @xmath4 .",
    "very recently , brandes , kosub and nick  @xcite proposed to call _ _ radial _ _ a centrality in which the addition of an arc @xmath2 does not decrease the rank of @xmath4 , in the sense that when we add an arc towards @xmath4 , nodes with a score smaller than or equal to @xmath4 continue to have this property .",
    "this is actually a weaker condition than the one used in  @xcite to state rank monotonicity ; in fact , it makes a form of non - monotonicity of ranks possible , as nodes with a score smaller than @xmath4 might end up having a score equal to @xmath4 when we add an arc towards @xmath4 .",
    "the authors of  @xcite propose also a different axiom for undirected networks .",
    "we have finally reached the core of this paper : since we are considering eleven centralities and three axioms , we have to verify 33 statements . for the size and density axioms",
    ", we compute in closed form the values of all measures , from which we can derive the desired results , whereas for the score - monotonicity axiom we provide direct proofs or counterexamples .",
    "we remark that in all our tables we use the proportionality symbol @xmath104 to mark values that have been rescaled by a common factor to make them more readable .",
    "table  [ tab : cliquecycle ] provides scores for the graph @xmath105 , from which we can check whether the size axiom is satisfied .",
    "the scores are immediately computable from the basic definitions ; as we noticed , @xmath88 is highly symmetrical , and so there are only two actual scores  the score of a node of the clique and the score of a node of the cycle . in the case of some spectral centrality measures",
    "there are several possible solutions , in which case we use the one returned by the power method starting from the uniform vector .",

    "the parameter @xmath7 is katz s attenuation factor . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is evident from table  [ tab : ir ] , such simple measures outperform in this test most of the very sophisticated alternatives proposed in the literature : this shows , on one hand , that it is possible to extract information from the graph underlying a query in very simple ways that do not involve any spectral or geometric technique and , on the other hand , that designing centralities around our axioms actually pays off .",
