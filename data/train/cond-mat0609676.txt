    "topological defects in two - dimensional crystals are relevant to a number of condensed matter systems including vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , wigner crystals @xcite , magnetic bubble arrays @xcite , atoms on surfaces , and dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "the creation of topological defects such as dislocations and disclinations leads to a two step melting process and an intermediate hexatic phase @xcite .",
    "topological defects play a role in the mechanical response of the system , such as when a shear is applied to the crystal , and also determine how effectively the crystal can be pinned to a disordered substrate .",
    "more recently , there has been growing interest in studying topological defects in two - dimensional systems on curved surfaces , such as colloidal particles on the surface of a liquid drop @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing insight into how defects can affect equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of these systems , understanding how individual topological defects move would also be valuable for technological applications , such as the nanoscale or mesoscale engineering of new two - dimensional materials .    in an effort to understand the dynamics of individual point defects in two dimensions ,",
    "recent experiments were conducted in which point defects were artificially created in a two - dimensional colloidal suspension by manipulating the colloids with optical tweezers @xcite . here , a defect is created by removing one or two colloids from a perfect triangular lattice , resulting in a mono- or divacancy .",
    "the defect configurations were shown to have a lower symmetry than the triangular lattice , and specific topological arrangements were characterized by the arrangement of fivefold and sevenfold coordinated colloids around the cores of the mono- and divacancies .",
    "the experiments showed that the trajectories of both types of defects followed the major axis directions of the triangular colloidal crystal . as a result , at short times the defect diffusion had one - dimensional characteristics .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the topological configurations and dynamics of single point vacancies and interstitial colloids in a two - dimensional triangular colloidal crystal .",
    "only vacancies were considered in the experimental work @xcite , but here we compare the behavior of vacancies to that of interstitial defects .",
    "we find that the point defects have numerous stable topological configurations as well as several frequently appearing excited configurations .",
    "the diffusive thermal motion of the defects is aligned with the major axes of the crystal , as also seen in the experiments . as the defect moves",
    ", it switches between gliding configurations , which contain two fivefold coordinated particles , and transient configurations , which contain three or more fivefold coordinated particles .",
    "the defect is able to change its gliding orientation in the transient configurations .",
    "the mobility of interstitial defects is greater than that of vacancy defects , and we show that this is a result of the fact that interstitial defects are more likely to undergo reorientations in their gliding direction than vacancy defects , giving the diffusion of the interstitial defects a more two - dimensional character .",
    "we discuss the implications of our work for other systems , such as the effect of the motion of interstitial and vacancy defects on transport in two - dimensional vortex lattices .",

    "temperatures are reported with respect to the melting temperature @xmath23 for the two - dimensional crystal . throughout this work ,",
    "we consider temperatures in the range @xmath24 , which is high enough to produce observable defect motion , but low enough to fall below the temperature at which a proliferation of fivefold and sevenfold defect excitations begins to occur .",
    "after initializing the system in a triangular lattice , we either add or subtract a single colloid from a location near the center of the sample .",
    "we then measure the time evolution of the system over a long time period of @xmath25 simulation time steps .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions in our sample prevent the individual defects from annihilating . since the interaction between topological defects is well known",
    "to be long ranged , finite size effects are always a concern in a periodic system .",
    "this is particularly important in studies of multiple interacting defects . in our case , we are working with only a single defect , which experiences a perfectly symmetrical interaction with its images across the periodic boundaries .",
    "this tends to minimize the impact of the periodic boundaries . to check for finite size effects , we tested larger systems and did not observe any changes in the diffusive behavior",
    ". additionally , our results for the vacancy defects are in good agreement with experiments , offering further evidence that we have avoided finite size effects .",

    "this indicates that the defect spends most of the time with @xmath64 oriented along the @xmath5 direction , meaning that the local burgers vector is oriented along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "reorientation transitions for the defect occur much less frequently than in the isotropic case , causing the defect to undergo one - dimensional diffusion for much longer periods of time , and resulting in a highly anisotropic diffusion over time .",
    "such anisotropic diffusion is consistent with the results obtained in the experiment of ref .  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : probabstates](b ) which shows the probability of observing interstitial defect configurations versus temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : probabstates](a ) shows that the vacancy defect spends most of the time in the split ( @xmath35 ) and the twofold crushed ( @xmath34 ) configurations , which both allow for gliding motion .",
    "the excited configuration @xmath37 occurs very infrequently and does not contribute significantly to the diffusive process .",
    "as the temperature increases , the transition states @xmath36 and @xmath37 occur with greater probability , indicating that the defect can reorient more easily .",
    "a greater number of defect reorientations combined with higher thermal excitation leads to a higher diffusion constant at higher temperature .",
    "since the gliding motion is one - dimensional , the defect can only move away from its starting position as rapidly as a one - dimensional random walk if no reorientation occurs .",
    "reorientation of the glide direction produces a more two - dimensional diffusion which allows the defect to move away more rapidly from its starting position .",
    "the interstitial defect spends much more time in the transition configuration @xmath39 than in any other configuration , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : probabstates](b ) .",
    "the excited @xmath42 configuration for the interstitial defect also appears with much higher probability than the excited @xmath37 configuration for the vacancy defect case .",
    "overall , this produces a much higher probability for reorientation of the direction of motion of the interstitial defect , and makes its diffusion _ more two - dimensional _ than that of the vacancy defect at all temperatures considered here .",
    "the result is a greater mobility of the interstitial with respect to the vacancy .",
    "an open question is how general our results are for defect motion in other two - dimensional systems where the particles have different types of interaction potentials .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to address this issue in detail , we believe that our results should hold for any two - dimensional system with relatively soft particle - particle interactions in which the ground state is a triangular lattice .",
    "very short range potentials , such as hard sphere interactions , are likely to produce significantly different behavior .",
    "it is possible for two - dimensional systems to have some other type of ordered ground state , such as a square or rectangular lattice .",
    "these lattices have different available gliding directions compared to the triangular lattice , so there could be either fewer or more modes of motion available to the defects .",
    "this would be an interesting issue to explore in the future .",
    "our results could have some implications for the mobility of defects in other two - dimensional systems where the number of vacancies or interstitials can be carefully controlled , such as superconducting vortices @xcite or colloids @xcite interacting with periodic substrates . at particle densities where there is one particle per substrate minimum , termed a matching density ,",
    "the system is free of topological defects , while vacancies appear for slightly lower particle densities and interstitial defects form at slightly higher particle densities .",
    "if the interstitial defects remain more mobile than vacancy defects in the presence of a substrate , the interstitials should depin more readily than the vacancy defects . in the case of superconducting vortices , this would imply that the critical current drops off more rapidly above the matching density ( when interstitials are present ) than below the matching density ( when vacancies are present ) . this is agreement with earlier observations @xcite .",
    "vacancy and interstitial defect motion has also been studied in three - dimensional systems in the context of atomic crystals .",
    "such systems are not only massive , making them sensitive to vibrational modes , but also can form a variety of different lattice structures depending on the details of the atomic interactions .",
    "a convenient method for producing isolated vacancies or interstitials in an atomic crystal is through ion damage processes .",
    "we note that in this context , unusually high mobility of self - interstitial atoms ( sias ) has been observed and attributed to the high likelihood of rotational motions for the dumbbell atomic configurations associated with the sia @xcite .",
    "although the dimensionality of the resulting motion is different , this resembles our observation that interstitial defects are more mobile than vacancy defects due to the greater likelihood of defect reorientation .",
    "another issue is the relative stability of interstitial and vacancy defects . due to the geometry of our system , which has periodic boundary conditions , both the interstitial and vacancy defects are completely stable since there is no free surface where the defects can annihilate . in a real crystal",
    ", the more mobile species of defect will reach the edge more rapidly and annihilate .",
    "thus , one implication of the faster mobility of interstitial defects is that a crystal that forms with an initial population of vacancy and interstitial defects will , over time , experience a greater loss of interstitial defects to the crystal edge compared to vacancies , particularly if there is a strain field that helps drive the defects to the edge .",
    "both interstitials and vacancies can still annihilate within the crystal , but the difference in edge annihilation could result in a dominant population of the slower moving vacancy defects in the relaxed crystal .",
    "in summary , we have studied the topological configurations and dynamics of individual vacancy and interstitial defects in a triangular two dimensional colloidal crystal .",
    "we use a voronoi cell construction to characterize the different topological configurations assumed by the defects . for vacancy defects , we find the same configurations that were observed in recent experiments . we show that interstitial defects , which were not studied in the experiment , appear in distinct configurations and have a significantly higher mobility than the vacancy defects . the mobility is affected by short lived excited configurations which have four or more fivefold or sevenfold coordinated colloids surrounding the defect .",
    "the defect diffusion process is one dimensional at short time scales when the defects glide along the symmetry directions of the crystal .",
    "periodically , the defects enter a transition configuration which has higher symmetry than the glide configuration .",
    "this permits the defect to reorient its glide direction when it returns to a glide configuration after a short period of time . as a result of these reorientations ,",
    "linear two - dimensional diffusion occurs in the long time limit .",
    "application of an anisotropic temperature causes the diffusion process to favor one of the permitted gliding directions .",
    "we describe the mechanisms of defect translation in detail , and show that the vacancy defect has one mode of motion , but the interstitial defect has three .",
    "it is these additional modes of motion that give the interstitial defect a has a much higher probability of undergoing a reorientation transition than the vacancy defect at a given temperature , causing the interstitial diffusion to be more two - dimensional in character and therefore faster .",

    "<S> the defect can glide along the crystal lattice directions , and it can rotate during an excited topological transition configuration to assume a different direction for the next period of gliding . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the vacancy defects are in good agreement with recent experiments . for interstitial point defects , which were not studied in the experiments , we find several of the same modes of motion as in the vacancy defect case along with two additional diffusion pathways . </S>",
    "<S> the interstitial defects are more mobile than the vacancy defects due to the more two - dimensional nature of the diffusion of the interstitial defects . </S>"
