    "while there is still no compelling experimental evidence that nature is supersymmetric on the weak scale , there have been recent reports of data that encourage this view .",
    "the most explicit is an event in cdf  @xcite that does not have a probable sm interpretation , and can naturally be explained as selectron pair production@xcite . in the interpretation when the lightest neutralino is the lsp",
    ", the analysis of this event leads to a fairly well determined range of masses and couplings for sleptons @xmath1 , charginos @xmath2 , and neutralinos @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the chargino and neutralino mass eigenstates , with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) being the lightest ( heaviest ) chargino and neutralino .",
    "if in addition there is a light stop squark @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , it is remarkable that the chargino mass and couplings from  @xcite can explain  @xcite the lep reported excess for @xmath8 decays @xmath9 , at least if that excess is not too large .",
    "another encouraging result  @xcite is that the lsp resulting from these studies has a mass and coupling such that it is a good candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe , giving @xmath10 in the following , we use the @xmath3 and @xmath2 masses and couplings reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if the stop squark @xmath6 and at least one neutralino @xmath3 are light , the top quark decay @xmath11 must occur along with @xmath12 with branching ratio about one  half .",
    "currently , the fnal top quark pair production counting rate is interpreted as a measurement of @xmath13 the reported values from cdf for this are about 7 pb @xcite , which is already larger than the predicted total cross section  @xcite ( about 5.5 pb ) for the top quark mass @xmath14 extracted from kinematic reconstruction ( about 175 gev ) .",
    "the d0 measurement for the production rate is smaller , but suffers from larger backgrounds . unless there is additional production of top quarks or other particles with similar decay modes ,",
    "there is no room for extra decay modes , such as @xmath15 , in this data sample ( this is made quantitative below ) .    in this paper",
    "we observe that supersymmetry , with certain reasonable and well  motivated choices of sparticle masses , will lead to extra top quark production .",
    "additionally , there are other final states from sparticles with a high purity of @xmath16quarks , leptons , and jets ; they can mimic the top quark signal .",
    "if squark ( @xmath17 ) and gluino ( @xmath18 ) masses ( excepting the stop squark ) are between 200 and 300 gev , then they have pb  level production rates at the tevatron .",
    "we assume squarks are heavier than gluinos , motivated by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite as well as the observation that gluinos decay predominantly to top quarks and stop squarks if the decays to other squarks are not kinematically allowed . a lower bound",
    "is set for the gluino mass by requiring @xmath19 so that the decay @xmath20 can occur for physical masses .",
    "since gluinos are majorana particles , they will decay equally to @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "pair production of @xmath23 will give a final state containing @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "if squarks are heavier than gluinos , they decay as @xmath27 @xmath28 ; @xmath29 has the largest coupling but the smallest phase space .",
    "we assume that @xmath30parity is approximately conserved , as implied by the interpretation of the cdf event as sparticle production , so that all sparticles decay to @xmath31 within the detector , and @xmath31 subsequently escapes .",
    "the couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 are largely determined by the analysis of ref .",
    "the size of the br@xmath32 is determined by the available phase space .",
    "we freely use the term minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to describe our models , and it should be understood that we do not assume gaugino mass unification , but we do assume that all squarks except the stop squark are mass degenerate .",
    "the relative masses of @xmath6 and @xmath2 are important for the signatures , and are not determined yet .",
    "motivated by the lep @xmath0 data , we assume @xmath33 then the dominant decays are @xmath34 and @xmath35  @xcite . if half of the top quarks decay to stop squarks , then @xmath36 followed by @xmath37 so half of all @xmath38 events give a @xmath39 signature ; the finite detector acceptance , clustering of jets , etc .",
    ", might lead to a similar final state in the standard model , but at a much lower rate .",
    "similar observable differences occur in every distinct @xmath25 channel ; results for some examples are shown in sec .",
    "4 . furthermore",
    ", a different value of @xmath40 is likely to be extracted from different channels if it is determined by comparison with a sm monte carlo , and the true value of @xmath40 might not be the apparent one .",
    "note that a large number of charm jets arise from stop decays ; if they could be tagged , e.g. by the lepton in charm semi  leptonic decays , it would help test our arguments .    in the following section , we review several results on the top quark which are relevant to our discussion . in section  3 , we present a supersymmetric model which is consistent with the results of section  2 , explains several other pieces of data , and predicts several signatures in the present and future fnal data samples .",
    "the detailed study of these models are shown in section  4 .",
    "finally , section  5 contains our conclusions .",
    "based on a number of measurements and predictions , it is possible to bound non  sm decay modes of the top quark which are `` invisible '' to the standard searches .",
    "the final state resulting from @xmath41 or @xmath42 would not have enough leptons or jets to be included in the leptonic , dileptonic , or hadronic event samples , and , hence , is invisible . here , we review briefly a previous analysis bounding these `` invisible '' decays@xcite .",
    "the fnal experiments report essentially two independent measures of the top quark mass : the kinematic measure , whereby the four  vectors of all the decay products are reconstructed into the four  vector of the parent particle , and the counting measure , whereby one compares the observed number of events , corrected by efficiencies , to the production cross section as a function of mass . additionally , based on single and double@xmath16tagged events ,",
    "cdf has reported a measurement of br@xmath43 for @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "we interpret this as a limit on @xmath45 br@xmath46 .",
    "the sm prediction for the production cross section @xmath47 is bounded theoretically and the current best prediction of @xmath47 at @xmath48 gev is 5.52@xmath49 pb from the first reference of  @xcite . given the measured quantities and the theoretical predictions and their uncertainties , one can perform a @xmath50 minimization in the variables @xmath40 , @xmath47 , and @xmath51 . finding the minimum value @xmath52 yields @xmath53 gev , @xmath54pb and @xmath55 . at the 95% confidence level , @xmath56 , so an upper limit on br(@xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 , exists of about 25% .",
    "this analysis disfavors a large component of non  sm top quark decays , such as a @xmath59 however , this result has limitations .",
    "namely , it does not include the possibility that the same physics which allows new top quark decays can also lead to more top quark production .",
    "( see @xcite for an analysis which includes @xmath60 production and the decays @xmath61 and concludes that a light @xmath6 is not excluded by the present fnal data even for br(@xmath62)=1/2 ) .",
    "furthermore , it assumes that all of the new decay modes result in final states which elude the standard searches .",
    "finally , it does not include the lep indirect fits to @xmath40 which favor a lower value ( for example , the world average top mass including lep , dis , slc , and fnal data is 161@xmath638 gev assuming an 80 gev higgs boson , as expected from ref .",
    "since this would weight the @xmath64 for a smaller @xmath40 and a larger @xmath47 , @xmath51 would be smaller . and",
    "more `` invisible '' decays would be allowed .",
    "based on these observations , it is premature to conclude that a light stop is inconsistent with the observed top quark events . in the following section , we present explicit supersymmetric models motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite which successfully address several of the loopholes in the previous analysis .",
    "squarks and gluinos are produced at a significant rate and decay largely into top quarks .",
    "the stop squark is light enough that the charginos @xmath65 and @xmath66 decay to @xmath67 , which in combination with other decays , give top  like final states .",
    "finally , a lower top mass predicts a larger sm production rate , allowing more `` invisible '' decays .",
    "if selectrons , charginos , and neutralinos have masses of order @xmath68 , then squarks and gluinos might be light enough to be produced in significant numbers at fnal . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is done with a general low energy softly broken supersymmetry theory , without assumptions about gaugino or squark mass unification . as a result",
    ", the gluino and squark masses are not determined .",
    "however , there are phenomenological reasons to settle on the range 200300 gev for these masses . given the analysis of @xmath0",
    ", we expect a light stop squark with mass less than about @xmath69 .",
    "lep and fnal limits do not allow this to be too small @xcite , and we are forced to @xmath70 values somewhere between about @xmath71 and @xmath69 . as explained in the previous section ,",
    "light stop squarks alone dilute the signal @xmath12 through decays @xmath11 at a level incompatible with the data , so a new top quark or top  like production mechanism is needed .",
    "the simplest method is to use the decay channel @xmath72 , which requires @xmath19 . for this to be the dominant decay channel",
    ", the other squarks must be heavier than the gluino . finally , the tevatron has limited parton luminosities to produce heavy particles .",
    "since about half of the top quark decays `` disappear '' , we need a production mechanism which is about the same size as the sm rate . therefore , we are naturally lead to squark and gluinos masses between 200 and 300 gev .",
    "we will see that a number of observables depend on the particular masses , so eventually they can be directly measured .",
    "a similar mass hierarchy follows from theoretical considerations .",
    "@xcite found gaugino masses obeying the mass relations @xmath73 rather than the unification relation @xmath74 this could be explained by anomalous behavior of the u(1 ) mass , so that the non - abelian masses may still approximately satisfy the unification relation @xmath75 then the gluino mass should be about three times the @xmath65 mass , or in the range 195270 gev .",
    "similarly , we assume here that squarks are ( except for stop mass eigenstates that are expected to be separated ) approximately degenerate , and about 2.5 times the selectron mass , as suggested by models . for numerical work ,",
    "we take a common squark mass @xmath76 for left- and right - handed squarks of five families which is slightly above @xmath77 . we study models with @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 gev , @xmath80 gev , and @xmath81 gev . all results are based on the analyses and models of ref .",
    "@xcite and are thus consistent with existing evidence for supersymmetry and with other particle physics constraints .",
    "in this section , we present separate results on the counting measurement of the top production cross section and kinematic measurement of the top quark mass in the supersymmetric models described in the previous section .",
    "all event simulation is performed using the monte carlo pythia 5.7 with supersymmetric extensions @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are computed at the born level with additional qcd radiation added in the leading  log approximation .",
    "the structure functions used are cteq2l , and the hard  scattering scale used in the evaluation of the structure functions and the running couplings is the partonic center of mass energy ( transverse mass ) if the partonic final state has no ( some ) non  zero qcd quantum numbers .",
    "particle energies are smeared using gaussian resolutions based on the cdf detector , and jets are defined using the pythia lucell subroutine .",
    "jets are @xmath16tagged with a constant efficiency when they contain a high@xmath82 @xmath16parton ; the exact efficiency is stated only when a result depends upon the choice .",
    "all leptons and photons must be isolated from excess transverse energy .    to eliminate dependence on the particulars of @xmath16tagging and isolation efficiencies and detector cracks",
    ", we will present some results as ratios with the sm signal expected using the same monte carlo routines . where there is no sm signal expected , or just a small one",
    ", then we show an expected number of events in 100 pb@xmath83 .",
    "first , we examine the counting measurement of the top quark production cross section .",
    "since there are so many production processes and decay chains at work when all sparticles have weak scale masses , it is clear that a multi  channel analysis should be performed . to illustrate this point",
    ", we present a unitarity table ( table 1 ) , based on a very loose set of experimental cuts , so that almost 100% of the simulated events fall into some category . on one hand , this is useful to check that a particular model does not contradict data by predicting an anomalously high rate in some channel . on the other hand",
    ", it can point the way to unexpected features in the data , or explain why various signals are not present .",
