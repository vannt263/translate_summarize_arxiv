    "recent articles on a model incorporating both a scalar electroweak higgs doublet and an electroweak higgs triplet @xcite have established that the model exhibits non - decoupling behavior @xcite , in the sense that deviations in the @xmath0 parameter from one do not necessarily vanish at one - loop in the limit of large triplet mass .",
    "such behavior appears difficult to reconcile with the expectation that the effects of the heavy fields should be suppressed by inverse powers of their mass .",
    "this presents a puzzle since the only renormalizable theory with a scalar higgs doublet has a @xmath0 parameter of precisely one ( at tree - level ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explicitly construct the low - energy effective field theory of this model obtained by integrating out the higgs triplet  thereby showing that there exists a perfectly sensible low - energy effective theory with a consistent dimensional analysis scheme .",
    "we find that the higher - dimensional , non - renormalizable , operators responsible for deviations in @xmath0 are suppressed not by inverse powers of the triplet mass , but rather by powers of the renormalized triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) divided by the renormalized doublet vacuum expectation value .",
    "therefore , the low - energy theory is perturbative only up to a scale which is inversely proportional to the renormalized triplet vev ( or , equivalently , inversely proportional to the square - root of @xmath3 ) .",
    "we show that two possibilities remain : either the contribution of the triplet vev is comparable to the existing experimental bounds , in which case the triplet scalars must have a mass of order 30 tev or lower , or if the triplet masses are very heavy ( much larger than 30 tev ) then the triplet vev is too small to be phenomenologically relevant .",
    "some authors @xcite have postulated that the model violates the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "we clarify that the presence of a large dimensionful coupling in this model implies that the decoupling theorem simply is not applicable in this case .    after introducing the full model in section [ sec : two ] ,",
    "we determine the mass - eigenstate fields and show that in the limit of small weak - isospin violation ( @xmath4 ) the spectrum consists approximately of a light higgs - doublet and a heavy higgs - triplet field .",
    "we then integrate out the heavy states to obtain a tree - level low - energy effective theory of the light states , which are dominantly composed of the original higgs - doublet states .",
    "we discuss the extension to higher loop order and use dimensional analysis to argue that the value of @xmath5 places an upper bound on the mass of the heavy mostly - triplet states  essentially because inclusion of these heavy states is the high - energy completion of the low - energy effective theory . in section iii , we make that mass bound more precise by analyzing perturbative unitarity in @xmath6 scattering , first at tree level and then at higher order .",
    "section iv discusses the non - decoupling behavior of the triplet states in the context of the effective field theory and shows that it arises only in the limit where a dimensionful coupling becomes large .",
    "this makes clear that the absence of decoupling is not a violation of the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "we then turn to the question of whether non - decoupling implies there must be low - energy consequences of the presence of the heavy fields .",
    "we find that , in order for the low- and high - energy theories to both be perturbative , one must adjust the renormalized value of the triplet vev to be of order @xmath7 , where @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 is the mass scale associated with the high - energy completion .",
    "if @xmath9 is greater than about 30 tev , this is more stringent than tuning the triplet vev to produce a phenomenologically acceptable higgs - triplet contribution to @xmath5 . as a result , in the context of a theory with a high completion scale , like a non - supersymmetric grand - unified theory ( gut ) @xcite , the constraint on the triplet vev",
    "is so severe that heavy higgs - triplet fields would not produce any experimentally - visible consequences  despite their intrinsic  non - decoupling \" nature .",
    "we will focus on the gauge- and scalar - sectors of an @xmath10 model @xcite with a complex scalar doublet @xmath11 , which transforms as a @xmath12 , and a real triplet field @xmath13 which transforms as a @xmath14 . for the triplet field we will use the @xmath15 matrix @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the usual pauli matrices . under an @xmath18 transformation @xmath19 ,",

    ", we also note that the scalar self - couplings @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the @xmath11-@xmath24 coupling @xmath28 must all be smaller than @xmath29 in order for the theory to remain perturbative .",
    "the form of the potential given above is convenient for matching the model to the expectations of , for instance , an @xmath30 grand unified theory @xcite : here the electroweak triplet arises @xcite from the * 24 * of @xmath30 and one expects @xmath23 and @xmath31 to be of order also to be of order @xmath32  this is the ordinary gauge hierarchy problem @xcite . ]",

    "[ eq : potentiali ] is useful in discussing the origin of the dimensionful terms in the potential , it is not the most convenient form in which to examine electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "we will show that this behavior prevents the model from satisfying the conditions necessary for the applicability of the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite ; the non - decoupling behavior of this model @xcite is discussed in section [ sec : decoupling ] .    as written in eq .",

    ", we see that the amount of fine - tuning required to keep @xmath108 small is @xmath191 , precisely of the same form as the amount of fine - tuning that is required to maintain the weak scale / gut scale hierarchy @xcite .",
    "while this result may seem surprising , it has a straightforward interpretation in terms of the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : unitarity ] . from eq .",
    "[ eq : unitaritybound ] , we see that if the low - energy theory is to remain perturbative and if @xmath192 , we must arrange for the properly renormalized low - energy triplet vev @xmath36 to be @xmath193 .",
    "the fine - tuning in eq .",
    "[ eq : finetuning ] is a reflection of the fine - tuning required to lower the triplet vev from @xmath194 to this much lower size .",
    "finally , we reiterate that as a consequence of the bound in eq .",
    "[ eq : unitaritybound ] , it is not sufficient for the low - energy triplet vev to be small enough to produce an experimentally acceptable value of @xmath108 .",
    "rather , in order for the low - energy theory to remain perturbative up to a scale of order @xmath32 , the properly renormalized value of @xmath36 must be @xmath195 or smaller .",
    "this , in turn , constrains @xmath196 to be far smaller than the current experimental bound",
    ". re - writing eq .",
    "[ eq : unitaritybound ] with @xmath197 , we find @xmath198 hence , for a fine - tuned non - supersymmetric grand unified theory that is perturbative at all energies , the presence of higgs - triplet bosons with gut - scale masses is entirely irrelevant for low - energy electroweak phenomenology .",
    "in contrast @xcite , for a little - higgs model @xcite in which the scale of new physics is of order @xmath199 tev , the properly renormalized value of @xmath36 must be @xmath200 or smaller . then assuming @xmath201 one has @xmath202 in this case , the constraints on @xmath196 from perturbativity and experiment are comparable because the scale of new physics is much closer to the weak scale .",
    "in this paper we have considered the properties of a model incorporating both a scalar electroweak higgs doublet and an electroweak higgs triplet .",
    "we constructed the low - energy effective theory below the scale of the triplet - mass , showing explicitly that the higher - dimensional , non - renormalizable , operators responsible for deviations in @xmath0 are suppressed not by inverse powers of the triplet mass , but rather by powers of the renormalized triplet vev ( @xmath124 ) divided by the renormalized doublet vev ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that perturbative unitarity in the low - energy theory breaks down at a scale inversely proportional to the renormalized triplet vev , both by using dimensional analysis and by an explicit computation of @xmath2 scattering in the low - energy theory .",
    "we have shown that two possibilities remain : either the contribution of the triplet vev is comparable to the existing experimental bounds , in which case the triplet scalars must have a mass of order 30 tev or lower , or if the triplet masses are much larger than 30 tev , as in the case of a non - supersymmetric gut theory , then the triplet vev is too small to be phenomenologically relevant .",
    "we have also clarified that , despite the non - decoupling behavior of the higgs - triplet , this model does not violate the decoupling theorem since it incorporates a large dimensionful coupling .",
    "finally , we note an interesting parallel between this work and non - decoupling effects in seesaw - extended mssm models @xcite .",
    "the non - decoupling of the triplet in the doublet - triplet higgs model can be viewed as arising from the fact that the goldstone bosons eaten by the @xmath70 are combinations of doublet- and triplet - states , as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : pions ] .",
    "similarly , in a seesaw - extended mssm it is possible to consider a limit in which the low - energy sneutrino field remains partially the superpartner of a sterile majorana seesaw neutrino field  even in the limit of large seesaw mass @xcite .",
