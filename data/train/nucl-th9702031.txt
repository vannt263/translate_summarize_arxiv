    "the electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout serves as a tool to study short - range correlations between two nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "thereby , one assumes that the photon interacts with the correlated pair through a one - nucleon current .",
    "however , nucleon pairs can also be ejected by two - nucleon currents which effectively take into account the influence of subnuclear degrees of freedom like mesons and isobars .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate this competing effect quantitatively , a reliable treatment of meson exchange as well as isobar currents is necessary before one can draw definite conclusions on the role of short - range correlations .",
    "experimental data of two - nucleon photoemission in the @xmath3 region were taken in different laboratories @xcite , while only one exploratory experiment on the @xmath4 reaction @xcite was completed .",
    "however , many new results will become available in the near future , exploiting continuous - wave accelerators and tagged - photon facilities .    in this note",
    "we would like to point out a pitfall which one may encounter when considering contributions from intermediate @xmath0 isobars to electromagnetic processes via the effective operator approach .",
    "to this end we remind the reader at the two first - order contributions of the @xmath0 to the effective electromagnetic two - body current of a two - nucleon subsystem shown diagramatically in fig .  [",
    "fig : graph ] .",
    "the first one ( i ) describes the @xmath0 excitation with subsequent deexcitation by pion exchange while the second ( ii ) describes the time interchange of the two steps , i.e. , first excitation of a virtual @xmath0 by pion exchange in a nn collision and subsequent deexcitation by photon absorption . in other words parts",
    "i and ii correspond to n@xmath0 admixtures in the final and the initial nn subsystem , respectively .",
    "they would be treated as explicit components of the wave function in the approach of nuclear isobar configurations ( ic ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is important to note that in diagram ii the @xmath0 is always far off - shell being part of the initial state irrespective of the energy transferred to the system by the real ( or virtual ) photon , whereas in diagram i the @xmath0 can become on - shell for a sufficiently high energy transfer .",
    "this then gives rise to a pronounced resonant behaviour of the matrix elements of diagram i when varying the energy transfer in the region between , say , 200@xmath5 and 400@xmath5mev .",
    "these features appear automatically in the ic approach , however , in the effective operator approach only if one keeps the full @xmath0 propagator in the intermediate state , making the effective two - body operator nonlocal .    for ( @xmath1,nn ) calculations on complex nuclei ,",
    "it is necessary to avoid this nonlocality in order to keep the numerical effort within reasonable limits .",
    "therefore , often the @xmath0 propagator is taken in the simplest static approximation keeping only the baryon mass difference @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the two contributions of fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] can be combined into one effective local two - nucleon operator .",
    "this approximation appears reasonable at low energies but it certainly fails when the transferred energy allows the excitation of an on - shell @xmath0 . in the latter case",
    "one might be tempted to replace @xmath7 by a resonant energy - dependent @xmath0 propagator .",
    "indeed this procedure has been followed in the past . however , it leads to a wrong effective operator , as is outlined in detail in the next section , and results in a strong overestimation of the contribution of diagram ii .",
    "this is shown in section [ results ] , where different treatments of the @xmath0 current are compared by means of a calculation for the @xmath2 process within the framework of refs .",
    "the effective current operator shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] is given by @xmath8 in the following we restrict ourselves to the dominant magnetic dipole n@xmath9 transition . for simplicity the hadronic n@xmath10nn transition is described by static @xmath11-exchange .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath12-exchange is straightforward but not essential for our purpose . under these assumptions ,",
    "the excitation current reads @xmath13 and the deexcitation part @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the photon momentum , and @xmath16 is the momentum of the exchanged pion .",
    "the factor @xmath1 collects various coupling constants , @xmath17 .",
    "the propagator of the resonance is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "it depends on the invariant energy @xmath19 of the @xmath0 . neglecting the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the intermediate n@xmath0 state ,",
    "one obtains a local approximation to @xmath18 .",
    "it reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy - dependent decay width of the @xmath0 and @xmath22mev its mass .",
    "clearly , @xmath19 can be very different in diagram i and ii . in diagram ii",
    ", it does not depend on the photon energy @xmath23 , and it is reasonable to approximate it by the nucleon mass @xmath24 on the other hand , @xmath25 depends on @xmath23 .",
    "it grows with @xmath23 and for @xmath26 the @xmath0 is essentially on - shell .",
    "following the recent suggestion made in @xcite for the choice of @xmath27 , the calculations presented below use @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the experimentally measured invariant energy of the two fast outgoing nucleons in an @xmath30 reaction .",
    "the energy dependence of the two parts of the @xmath0 current can also be considered from a different point of view .",
    "for forward propagating exchanged pions , both parts are related to the process of electromagnetic pion production on one nucleon followed by its reabsorption on the second nucleon .",
    "part i is connected to the @xmath31-channel contribution of the @xmath0 which leads to the well - known resonant @xmath32 pion production multipole , whereas part ii is connected to the @xmath33-channel contribution which has only a smooth energy dependence",
    ".    only for low energy transfers , say below 100@xmath5mev , it may be justified to approximate also @xmath34 .",
    "then the @xmath0 propagators in the excitation and deexcitation parts are equal and the spin and isospin structure of their sum simplifies due to the cancellation of terms . to see this , one first has to rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j1 ] ) and ( [ eq : j2 ] ) using the following identity for the n@xmath9 transition spin ( isospin ) operators @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are two arbitrary vectors",
    ". one finds @xmath38 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left ( 2i\\vec k - \\vec k \\times      \\vec\\sigma^{(1)}_{nn } \\right ) \\times \\vec q \\,\\ ,",

    "q    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{1}{m_\\delta - m_n}\\ ,    \\frac{\\vec\\sigma^{(2)}_{nn}\\cdot\\vec k}{\\vec k^2+m_\\pi^2}. \\label{eq : le}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form is usually quoted in the literature ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "it serves as starting point for model calculations in heavier nuclei @xcite as well as in few - nucleon reactions @xcite .",
    "the simple replacement of the low energy propagator @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) by the resonant @xmath18 of eq .  ( [ eq : prop ] ) in order to obtain an operator which is more appropriate for studying photon absorption at higher energies is , however , in no way justified .",
    "this procedure implies a strong overestimation of the deexcitation part at higher energies since it introduces a resonant behaviour also there .",
    "nevertheless , it has been used in the past ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . to make this point clearer , it is useful to consider the isospin matrix structure of the excitation and deexcitation current .",
    "table [ tab : iso ] summarizes the relevant isospin matrix elements .",
    "note that transitions between @xmath42 pairs with isospin @xmath43 are always forbidden for an isovector current . according to table [ tab : iso ]",
    ", the above replacement leads to wrong conclusions , in particular when the absorption on @xmath44 pairs is studied , or in cases where the absorption on @xmath42 pairs with isospin @xmath43 is expected to be relevant . in ( @xmath45 ) reactions , only those contributions which proceed via absorption on @xmath42 pairs with @xmath46 ( like the quasi deuteron mechanism for example ) remain unaffected with respect to the correct prescription , as the contribution of the operator ( [ eq : j2s ] ) vanishes .",
    "in this section we investigate the dependence of @xmath47 cross sections on the different treatments of the @xmath0 current within the theoretical model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "although different channels can be considered in the model , we here have chosen the @xmath47 channel since there the @xmath0 current is dominant at intermediate energies .",
    "exclusive cross sections of the @xmath2 knockout reaction have been calculated for transitions to the ground state and low - lying discrete excited states of @xmath48 . in the model",
    "the final state @xmath49 of the residual nucleus is obtained from the removal of a nucleon pair coupled to @xmath50 .",
    "the correlated wave function of the pair is calculated with the single - particle states of ref .",
    "@xcite and the jastrow - type correlation function of ref .",
    "the final - state interaction is taken into account by means of the optical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , describing the interaction of each one of the two protons with the residual nucleus .",
    "more details of the model and of the theoretical ingredients of the calculation are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections of the @xmath51 reaction at @xmath52mev and @xmath53mev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] in a coplanar and symmetrical kinematics as a function of the angle @xmath1 between the photon and one of the symmetrically outgoing protons .",
    "three different treatments of the @xmath0 current are compared .",
    "the solid curves refer to the correct form , i.e. , use of the resonant @xmath0 propagator in the excitation current only ( part i of fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] ) . adopting the resonant propagator in both excitation and deexcitation currents (",
    "part i and ii ) leads to the dotted curves .",
    "the dashed curves refer to the low energy approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) . in the following ,",
    "these three currents are referred to as @xmath54(rn ) , @xmath54(rr ) , and @xmath54(nn ) , respectively , indicating the use of either the resonant ( r ) or energy - independent nonresonant ( n ) propagator in part i and ii . already at 150@xmath5mev , @xmath54(rn ) and @xmath54(rr ) lead to peak cross sections which differ by nearly a factor two .",
    "the difference grows with the photon energy and at 300@xmath5mev the peak cross sections differ by more than a factor five .",
    "as one would expect , @xmath54(nn ) underestimates and @xmath54(rr ) overestimates the cross section .",
    "one notes also a different shape of the angular distributions for @xmath54(rn ) on the one hand and @xmath54(rr ) or @xmath54(nn ) on the other hand . at 300@xmath5mev",
    "the minimum is less pronounced for the solid curve .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath54(rn ) has a different operator structure with respect to its spin and angular momentum dependence , since its parts i and ii do not enter with equal weight as in @xmath54(rr ) and @xmath54(nn ) .",
    "for the same reason one may expect qualitatively different predictions for polarization observables .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] the differential cross section in coplanar and symmetrical kinematics at zero recoil momentum of the residual nucleus is plotted as a function of the photon energy .",
    "this corresponds to the region in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] where the cross section is maximal .",
    "[ fig : energy ] clearly shows the strong overestimation of the cross section when @xmath54(rr ) is used .",
    "this certainly would affect any analysis of experimental @xmath47 data in the @xmath0 region in view of the role of short - range correlations .",
    "the low - energy approximation @xmath54(nn ) can of course not predict a resonance peak .",
    "the dash - dotted curve has been calculated with @xmath54(rr ) as the dotted one , but the choice in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) has been replaced by the energy assignment @xmath55 used , e.g. , in ref .",
    "it shifts the resonance position towards lower energies and thus leads to a further overestimation of the cross section for energies below 260@xmath5mev .",
    "the effect of this choice of @xmath27 on the angular distribution has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath56 reaction .",
    "calculations for the transition to the excited @xmath57 and to the first excited @xmath58 state of @xmath48 have also been performed .",
    "qualitatively , the results agree with the former ones . however , the size of the overestimation varies .",
    "this again can be traced back to the different operator structure of @xmath54(rn ) and @xmath54(rr ) .",
    "it becomes visible when the quantum numbers of the active nucleon pair change and can not simply be simulated even by an energy - dependent rescaling factor .",
    "similar results are obtained in the @xmath56 reaction , where the presence of the longitudinal contribution , due to correlations , reduces the effects of the different treatments of the @xmath0 current .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the treatment of the @xmath0 isobar current in electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout reactions based on an effective two - nucleon operator . it has been emphasized that this current consists of a @xmath0 excitation part and a @xmath0 deexcitation part corresponding to a @xmath0 admixture in the initial state .",
    "these two parts are related to the @xmath31- and @xmath33-channel contributions of the @xmath0 to electromagnetic pion production on a nucleon .",
    "only the excitation part of the current has a resonant energy dependence which can result in a characteristic energy dependence of observables .",
    "this different energy dependence of excitation and deexcitation parts has to be taken care of when going to higher energy transfers .",
    "in particular , it does not allow to replace the propagator @xmath7 of the simplest static approximation to the current ( which is justified in the low - energy region ) by a resonant propagator .",
    "the error is two - fold : first , the deexcitation part would get a wrong energy dependence and , secondly , one would loose parts of the excitation current which have been cancelled by terms in the deexcitation current . in view of the fact that this prescription has been used in the literature , we have performed an explicit calculation for the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "it shows that the simple replacement may lead to an overestimation of the cross section ( in the preferred kinematic region around zero recoil momentum of the residual nucleus ) by more than a factor five .",
    "such a variation of the @xmath0 contribution is definitely too large when one wants to use two - proton knockout as a tool to study short range correlations in the nucleus .",
