    "in this paper , we consider mainly schrdinger operators @xmath3 on @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real - valued smooth function , which is supposed to be analytic outside of a compact set and to vanish at infinity .",
    "the resonances of @xmath3 near the real axis are thus well - defined through the analytic distortion method due to aguilar and combes @xcite and hunziker @xcite , and we denote @xmath7 their set .",
    "we are interested in resonances of @xmath3 generated by a unique non - degenerate global maximum of @xmath6 .",
    "we can suppose that it is at @xmath8 and that @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , our precise assumption is that the trapped set at energy @xmath12 , that is the set of bounded classical trajectories with energy @xmath12 , is @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath6 is globally analytic , this question has been solved by sjstrand @xcite in the general case of a non - degenerate critical point , and by briet , combes and duclos @xcite under a virial assumption ( see also the third author @xcite in dimension @xmath14 ) .",
    "they have proved that , in any complex neighborhood of @xmath15 of size @xmath16 , there is a bijection @xmath17 between @xmath18 and @xmath7 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 is what we call the set of pseudo - resonances .",
    "they obtained further a full asymptotic expansion for isolated resonances .",
    "then , under the assumption that the @xmath21 s are @xmath22-independent , kaidi and kerdelhu @xcite have extended this result to disks of size @xmath23 for any @xmath240,1]$ ] .",
    "eventually , hitrik , sjstrand and v ngc @xcite have obtained a similar result in dimension 2 for disks of size @xmath14 .",
    "this kind of resonances appears naturally in the context of general relativity , in particular for the study of black holes as in s barreto and zworski @xcite .    in all these works ,",
    "the potential was supposed to be analytic in a whole neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain here the same kind of result , with the weaker assumption that @xmath6 is @xmath2 everywhere and analytic at infinity .",
    "our approach also provides a polynomial estimate for the cut - off resolvent away from the resonances , and we are able to describe the resonant states .",
    "however , we do not control the multiplicity of the resonances .",
    "the precise statements are given in section [ s5 ] .",
    "note that , for shape resonances , lahmar - benbernou , martinez and the second author @xcite have already proved that one can relax the analyticity hypothesis in the work of helffer and sjstrand @xcite . concerning the study of the scattering amplitude at a barrier - top , the analyticity of the potential is not necessary ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as a matter of fact , our result about resonances is closely related to the description of the propagation of singularities in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic fixed point , for energies @xmath25 close to the critical energy @xmath12 .",
    "indeed we have proved in section 8 of @xcite that the absence of resonances follows from the uniqueness of the solution to the microlocal cauchy problem at the trapped set @xmath26 in this paper , we show uniqueness for when the energy @xmath25 is at distance @xmath16 of @xmath18 . the corresponding theorem can be found in section [ s6 ] . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "such a result was obtained for energies @xmath25 outside of some exceptional set which was not completely described . in other words , we prove here that the propagation of singularities results of @xcite hold whenever the energy @xmath25 is not close to a pseudo - resonance .",
    "the method we use here is quite different and less technical compared with that in @xcite .",
    "it is based on commutations with annihilation operators ( as for the computation of the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator ) rather than on energy estimates . for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us explain this approach for @xmath27 in dimension @xmath14 .",
    "if we denote the annihilation - like operator @xmath28 , a direct computation gives @xmath29 consider now a solution @xmath30 of with @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 . applying @xmath34 times , we get @xmath35 for all @xmath36 . since the operator @xmath37 is invertible for @xmath38 , we deduce @xmath39 for these values of @xmath34 . a standard argument of microlocal analysis implies that @xmath30 is a lagrangian distribution associated to @xmath40 , the characteristic manifold of the pseudodifferential operator @xmath41 .",
    "a similar idea was used by hassell , melrose and vasy @xcite in a different context .",
    "using that @xmath30 is a lagrangian distribution , becomes a transport equation on the symbol of @xmath30 .",
    "then , if @xmath25 is away from @xmath18 , we can conclude that @xmath42 microlocally near @xmath43 .",
    "this approach may be carried out in other contexts , even if only in the case of a general non - degenerate critical point .",
    "each time , the notion of lagrangian distribution associated to @xmath40 used above should be replaced by an appropriate class of functions .    for the reader s convenience , we recall some notations and terminology of microlocal analysis in appendix [ s7 ] .",

    "we consider the semiclassical schrdinger operator @xmath3 on @xmath4 given in and we assume that    [ h1 ] @xmath45 extends holomorphically in the sector @xmath46 for some @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 as @xmath49 in @xmath50 .    under this assumption , one can define the distorted operator @xmath51 of angle @xmath52 small enough .",
    "its spectrum is discrete in @xmath53 , and the resonances of @xmath3 are the eigenvalues of @xmath51 in @xmath54 .",
    "they can also be defined as the poles of the meromorphic extension of @xmath55 from the upper complex half - plane .",
    "we send back the reader to section 2 of @xcite ( and the references given there ) for the precise definitions and more details on the resonances .",
    "we denote @xmath56 the symbol of @xmath3 .",
    "the associated hamiltonian vector field is @xmath57 integral curves @xmath58 of @xmath59 are called hamiltonian or bicharacteristic trajectories , and @xmath60 is constant along such curves .",
    "we also suppose that    [ h2 ] @xmath6 has a non - degenerate maximum at @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "in other words , there may be more than one resonance near each pseudo - resonance ( and reciprocally ) . that the multiplicity is unknown comes from our method of proof . nevertheless , following the proof of proposition 4.2 of @xcite ( see also section 3 of @xcite )",
    ", one can show that the number of resonances counted with their multiplicity near each pseudo - resonance is uniformly bounded .",
    "it should also be possible to prove that number of resonances is greater or equal to the multiplicity of pseudo - resonances as in proposition 4.6 of @xcite .",
    "the results of this part are stated for schrdinger operators but hold true in more general settings .",
    "what is really needed is that the resonances of the pseudodifferential operator @xmath94 can be defined by complex distortion and that the trapped set at energy @xmath12 consists of a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "indeed , the results used in the proofs ( that is section 5 of @xcite and theorem [ a1 ] below ) are valid for pseudodifferential operators . in particular , if @xmath3 has a subprincipal symbol , say @xmath95 , then the set of pseudo - resonances should be replaced by @xmath96 note that the `` black box '' framework of sjstrand and zworski @xcite allows to define the resonances for a large class of operators .",
