    "a basic framework has been developed for the formation of low - mass stars in relative isolation @xcite .",
    "it involves gradual condensation of dense cores from strongly magnetized , background molecular clouds through ambipolar diffusion , followed by dynamic core collapse to form stars .",
    "quantitative studies based on this by now `` standard '' scenario have been carried out by many authors , with increasingly sophisticated input physics @xcite . however , with few exceptions @xcite , axisymmetry has been adopted .",
    "the adopted symmetry precludes a detailed investigation of cloud fragmentation , generally thought to be a necessary step in the formation of binary and multiple stellar systems ; it is in such systems that most stars are found .",
    "we seek to improve this situation by removing the restriction of axisymmetry and systematically investigating the effects of the strong magnetic fields envisioned in the standard picture of single star formation on fragmentation and their implications on binary and multiple star formation .",
    "fragmentation of nonmagnetic clouds has been studied extensively over the years , mostly through numerical simulations ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the canonical case of a spherical cloud",
    ", the fragmentation is mainly controlled by the ratios of the cloud thermal and rotational energy to the gravitational energy , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , although the distributions of density and angular momentum also play a role .",
    "molecular line observations @xcite suggest that star - forming cores of molecular clouds are far from being rotationally supported , with a typical ( low ) value of @xmath4 . for such slowly rotating cores ,",
    "the criterion for fragmentation is roughly @xmath5 , if the cores are idealized as spheres of uniform density and rigid rotation @xcite .",
    "more realistic , centrally peaked density distributions would lower the critical @xmath2 for fragmentation .",
    "such distributions are commonly inferred in the well - observed starless cores such as l1544 @xcite . the central concentration , if taken as an initial condition , tends to make fragmentation more difficult @xcite .    fragmentation of strongly magnetized clouds with mass - to - flux ratios below the critical value @xmath6 ( i.e. , subcritical ) is expected to be quite different @xcite . through magnetic braking",
    ", the field controls the angular momentum evolution of the cloud , until a supercritical dense core forms @xcite ; it thus determines the value of @xmath3 of the core .",
    "more importantly , the field can provide most of the cloud support against self - gravity and thus allow a cloud to have an arbitrarily small thermal energy compared to the gravitational energy and still be in a mechanical equilibrium initially .",
    "the low value of @xmath2 is a key ingredient of fragmentation . on the other hand , the presence of a strong magnetic field tends to stifle cloud fragmentation , if the field and matter are well coupled @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a frozen - in subcritical field , fragmentation is suppressed altogether @xcite .",
    "fragmentation can in principle resume in the part of cloud that has become magnetically supercritical @xcite , through ambipolar diffusion .",
    "it is however difficult to predict _ a priori _ how the fragmentation should proceed , if at all , in a cloud that is only _ partially _ coupled to a strong magnetic field .",
    "@xcite showed through linear analysis that , in a lightly ionized medium such as a molecular cloud , the jeans instability is not completely inhibited no matter how strong the magnetic field is ; rather , it grows on an ambipolar diffusion , rather than dynamic , timescale .",
    "@xcite followed the nonlinear evolution of a set of magnetically subcritical , super - jeans mass clouds assuming axisymmetry and found that either a dense , supercritical core or ring forms as a result of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the supercritical ring is expected to fragment readily into a number of dense cores , producing perhaps a small group of stars .",
    "the ring breakup will be studied elsewhere . in this letter",
    ", we shall concentrate on the more subtle problem of the fragmentation of magnetized single cores , with an eye on forming binaries and multiple stellar systems . as is common with numerical studies of cloud fragmentation and binary formation",
    ", we focus on the growth of @xmath0 ( or bar ) mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in   [",
    "sec : models ] we describe our formulation of the problem of nonaxisymmetric cloud evolution .",
    "numerical results on bar formation are presented in   [ sec : results ] , and their implications on binary and multiple star formation as well as the observed elongation of dense cores are discussed in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "an ordered , subcritical magnetic field allows cloud material to settle along field lines into a disk - like geometry .",
    "we assume that the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , and adopt the thin - disk approximation @xcite .",
    "the cloud evolution is followed in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane of a cartesian coordinate system @xmath9 . outside the disk , the magnetic field",
    "is assumed to be current free and uniform far from the cloud .",
    "an isothermal equation of state is adopted ( unless noted otherwise ) , so that the pressure and surface density are related through @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ( effective ) isothermal sound speed .",
    "the governing equations are the nonaxisymmetric versions of equations ( 1 ) through ( 7 ) of @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for star formation are not well determined either observationally or theoretically .",
    "following @xcite we prescribe an axisymmetric reference state for our model clouds with the distributions of mass and magnetic field given by @xmath12^{3/2}}\\ \\ \\ { \\rm and } \\ \\ \\ b_{z , \\rm ref } ( x , y ) = b_{z , \\infty},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "the background field strength @xmath14 is characterized by the dimensionless flux - to - mass ratio @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the reference clouds are not in an equilibrium state and are allowed to evolve into one with magnetic field frozen - in , before ambipolar diffusion is turned on at time @xmath16 . at @xmath16 ,",
    "we impose on top of the equilibrium surface density @xmath17 an @xmath0 perturbation of relative amplitude @xmath18 , @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle measured from the @xmath7-axis .",
    "a slow rotation is also added to the cloud at this time , according to the prescription @xmath21 where @xmath22 is essentially the magnetosonic speed , and @xmath23 measures the rotation rate .",
    "the subsequent , ambipolar diffusion - driven evolution of the perturbed cloud is followed numerically , subject to the condition of fixed @xmath24 and @xmath25 at the cloud outer radius , taken to be twice the characteristic radius @xmath26 .",
    "other choices of the reference state will be explored elsewhere .",
    "our calculations are carried out using an mhd code based on that of @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic part is solved using roe s method .",
    "the equation for magnetic field evolution has a form identical to that for mass conservation , and is solved in the same manner .",
    "both the magnetic and gravitational potentials satisfy the poisson equation , and are solved using a convolution method @xcite .",
    "we refine the computational grids whenever the so - called jeans condition is about to be violated @xcite , taking into account the magnetic effect on jeans condition .",
    "the computations are carried out using nondimensional quantities .",
    "the units we adopted are @xmath11 for speed , @xmath27 for surface density , @xmath28 for gravitational acceleration , and @xmath29 for magnetic field strength .",
    "the units for length and time are , respectively , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in two figures . in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we show the evolution of a `` benchmark '' cloud with the dimensionless radius @xmath32 , initial flux - to - mass ratio @xmath33 and rotation rate @xmath34 . the @xmath0 perturbation added has a relative amplitude of `` merely '' @xmath35 . during the initial , quasi - static stage of evolution ,",
    "a central core condenses gradually out of the magnetically subcritical cloud , with no apparent tendency for the mode to grow .",
    "rather , the iso - density contours appear to oscillate , changing the direction of ( slight ) elongation along the @xmath7-axis in the disk plane to @xmath8-axis , as evident from panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "( we confirmed that the disk continues to oscillate around the equilibrium state in the absence of ambipolar diffusion . )",
    "the period of the oscillation is more or less independent of @xmath23 as long as @xmath23 is small . after a supercritical core develops , the contraction becomes dynamic , as seen from the velocity field in panel ( c ) . by this time , the @xmath0 mode has grown significantly , resulting in a bar - like core at the center with an aspect ratio of roughly 2 .",
    "as the collapse continues , the bar growth remains relatively modest [ panel ( d ) ] until the very end of the starless collapse , when the growth rate increases dramatically [ panel ( e ) ] . beyond a critical dimensionless surface density of @xmath36 , corresponding to a volume density of @xmath37  @xmath38 , we change the equation of state from isothermal to adiabatic , with an index of @xmath39 , to mimic the transition to optically thick regime of cloud evolution .",
    "the density distribution and velocity field around the time when an accretion shock begins to develop are shown in panel ( f ) .",
    "the bar bound by the shock is analogous to the `` first '' core of spherical calculations .",
    "it has an aspect ratio of about 13 .",
    "this highly elongated `` first '' bar is expected to break up into two or more pieces , as discussed further in   [ sec : conclusions ] .    to discuss the bar growth more quantitatively , we plot in figure [ fig:2 ] the aspect ratio @xmath40 of the darkest region in figure [ fig:1 ] ( with @xmath41 ) as a function of the central surface density @xmath42 , together with the flux - to - mass ratio @xmath43 at the cloud center .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0 mode grows little when the entire cloud remains subcritical ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , as one might expect intuitively .",
    "as the central region becomes more and more supercritical , the mode grows significantly , producing a bar of aspect ratio @xmath45 .",
    "this ratio stays more or less `` frozen '' during the subsequent evolution , presumably due to the onset of rapid collapse , which leaves little time for the bar to grow .",
    "the flux - to - mass ratio does not change much either during this period , also as a result of the rapid collapse which prevents the magnetic flux from leaking out .",
    "the fairly strong trapped field ( with @xmath46 ) further hinders the bar growth , which picks up speed only towards the end of collapse before forming a singularity , as a result of the @xcite instability .",
    "we have studied other models with different initial parameters in the range of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we find that the bar grows more rapidly for a smaller @xmath51 , larger @xmath26 , larger @xmath23 , or larger @xmath18 .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath52 , @xmath53 ( adopted by @xcite for their axisymmetric model of the well - observed starless core l1544 ) , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , then the aspect ratio reaches 33 when the `` first '' bar forms , as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "interestingly , a plateau region is also evident , where the aspect ratio is temporarily `` frozen '' at @xmath54 , as in the benchmark model .",
    "we find that the frozen value of the aspect ratio depends weakly on the initial amplitude of perturbation , which may have observable consequences as we discuss below .",
    "we have followed numerically the growth of @xmath0 mode during the ambipolar - diffusion driven evolution of magnetically subcritical clouds .",
    "our main conclusion is that , despite the presence of the strong magnetic field , a perturbation of modest amplitude can grow nonlinearly into a highly elongated bar , which is expected to fragment into small pieces gravitationally . before discussing fragmentation ,",
    "we comment on the effects of bar growth on the observed shapes of molecular cloud cores .    dense cores of molecular clouds are intimately associated with star formation , with roughly half of them already harboring infrared sources @xcite .",
    "the other half are thought to be well on their way to star formation , with the `` starless '' phase lasting for only a few dynamic times .",
    "the cores are observed to have significant elongation , with a typical aspect ratio of 2 @xcite .",
    "statistics of core elongation have been interpreted as indicating most cores have prolate 3-dimensional shape @xcite , although oblate cores formed as a result of settling along magnetic field lines can have a projected aspect ratio similar to that observed @xcite .",
    "nonlinear growth of the bar mode in a direction perpendicular to the field lines modifies the core shape drastically , making it triaxial in general .",
    "some evidence for the triaxial nature of cores has been marshalled by @xcite .",
    "we propose that it is due to the significant bar growth during the transition period when @xmath43 decreases from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , after the core has become supercritical ( which makes bar growth possible ) but before a rapid collapse sets in ( which leaves little time for the bar to grow ) .",
    "the bar growth removes an oft - invoked objection against the standard scenario of ambipolar diffusion - driven core formation based on the elongated or filamentary shape of dense cores @xcite .",
    "indeed , the triaxial nature of the dense cores , coupled with the relatively slow , subsonic infall motion inferred @xcite , may provide the strongest support yet for the standard scenario .",
    "the continued evolution of bar - like cores , such as the one shown in figure [ fig:1]c , would formally lead to a singular filament , if the isothermal assumption is kept .",
    "however , it is well known that the equation of state stiffens when the optical depth exceeds unity ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "the stiffening slows down the collapse , allowing more time for the elongated bar to fragment gravitationally into small pieces .",
    "in fact , the major axis of the bar exceeds twice the critical wavelength for fragmentation of an infinitely - long filament @xcite in panels ( e ) and ( f ) of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "such bar formation is also shown by @xcite and @xcite for nonmagnetized clouds .",
    "recent examples of ( nonmagnetic ) bar fragmentation induced by the stiffening of equation of state are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for magnetized bars , one needs to consider in addition the rapid decoupling of magnetic field from matter , which occurs above a density of order @xmath57  @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the decoupling decreases the magnetic support quickly , and is in some sense equivalent to a sudden cooling .",
    "it should make the fragmentation easier .",
    "@xcite studied the fragmentation of 3d magnetic clouds numerically , treating the magnetic forces and ambipolar diffusion in an approximate way .",
    "he concluded that magnetic fields can enhance cloud fragmentation , by reducing the tendency for the development of a central singularity , which would make fragmentation more difficult .",
    "we also find that magnetic fields can promote fragmentation , but for a different reason .",
    "strong magnetic fields can support clouds of more than one jeans mass , which provides an initial condition that is conducive to fragmentation once the magnetic support weakens .",
    "we believe that it is the multi - jeans mass nature of the magnetically subcritical clouds that drives the nonlinear growth of the bar ( and higher order ) mode .",
    "we conclude that the magnetically subcritical clouds envisoned in the standard scenario of star formation can produce not only single stars but also , perhaps even preferentially , binary and multiple star systems .",
    "a parameter survey will be carried out to firm up this conclusion .",
