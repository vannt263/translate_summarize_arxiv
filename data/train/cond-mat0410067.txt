    "the problem of proving or verifying fourier s law , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thermal conductivity , in any system evolving through newtonian dynamics has been a challenge for theorists @xcite . so far most studies have been restricted to one - dimensional systems for the simple reason that they are easier to study through simulations and through whatever analytic methods that are available .",
    "also the hope is that such studies on one - dimensional systems provides insights which will be useful when one confronts the more difficult ( and experimentally more relevant ) problem of higher dimensional systems .",
    "for one dimensional systems , some of the most interesting results that have been obtained are : ( 1 ) for momentum conserving nonlinear systems , the heat current @xmath1 decreases with system size @xmath0 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus fourier s law ( which predicts @xmath10 ) is not valid .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 is expected to be universal but its exact value is still not known . a renormalization group analysis of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite predicts @xmath12 while mode - coupling theory @xcite gives @xmath13 .",
    "the results from simulations are not able to convincingly decide between either of these .",
    "( 2 ) for disordered harmonic systems we get @xmath8 again but the exponent @xmath11 depends on the properties of the heat baths @xcite",
    ".    in dimensions higher than one , there are few detailed studies and it is fair to say that it is totally unclear as to whether or not fourier s law will hold and , if not , then what the value of the exponent @xmath14 is . for nonlinear systems which are expected to show local thermal equilibrium ,",
    "both the hydrodynamic approach and mode coupling theories predict a logarithmic divergence of the conductivity in two dimensions .",
    "there have been simulations by lippi and livi @xcite who find a logarithmic divergence but simulations on larger - size systems by grassberger et al @xcite seem to obtain a power law divergence . a disordered harmonic model in @xmath15 was studied in simulations by yang @xcite who claimed that beyond some critical disorder one gets fourier s law , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath16 .",
    "it is doubtful if this claim is correct .",
    "the data in the paper seems to indicate @xmath17 which is _ not _ fourier s law . besides",
    ", these simulations were done with nose - hoover heat baths and it is known that these can be problematic when applied to harmonic systems @xcite .",
    "simulations by hu et al @xcite on the same model but with stochastic heat baths do not find a fourier behaviour .",
    "finally an older study by poetzsch et al @xcite looked at heat conduction in a @xmath15 system with both disorder and nonlinearity and they give some evidence for fourier behaviour .    in this paper",
    "we consider heat conduction in a @xmath15 disordered harmonic system .",
    "let us first try to see what one should expect theoretically .",
    "we expect localization phenomena ( for phonons ) to play an important role .",
    "a renormalization group calculation @xcite predicts : in @xmath18 all modes with @xmath19 are localized ; in @xmath15 all modes with @xmath20^{-1/2}$ ] are localized ; in @xmath21 there is a finite band of frequencies of extended states .",
    "this is similar to results for electron localization with the important difference that here the @xmath22 modes are extended even in @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "also for the case of electrons , only electrons near the fermi - level contribute significantly to transport while in heat transport all phonons contribute . from the localization",
    "results we expect that in @xmath21 the current in a disordered harmonic system should be independent of system size ( @xmath23 ) . in one and two",
    "dimensions it is the small number of low - frequency phonons ( @xmath24 ) which dominate transport properties .",
    "the fact that @xmath25 with increasing @xmath0 immediately implies that @xmath26 . in @xmath18 it has been shown @xcite that the exact value of @xmath14 depends on the low frequency spectral properties of the bath . a similar calculation is not available in the @xmath15 case and we address this specific question .",
    "here we present results from a detailed simulational study to determine the exponent @xmath14 for a mass - disordered harmonic system .",
    "two different kinds of stochastic baths are considered , one with white noise and the other with correlated noise .",
    "we also study a special case where the disorder is correlated .    *",
    "definition of model * : we consider heat conduction in a two - dimensional mass - disordered harmonic crystal described by the hamiltonian & h&= _ + _ [ ( x_ij - x_i-1j)^2 + & + & ( x_ij - x_i+1j)^2 + ( x_ij - x_ij-1)^2+(x_ij - x_ij+1)^2 ] where @xmath27 denote the position ( particle displacements about equilibrium positions ) , momentum and mass of a particle at the site @xmath28 .",
    "we set the masses of exactly half the particles to one and the remaining to two and make all configurations equally probable .",
    "heat conduction takes place in the @xmath29-direction and we assume that the ends of the system are fixed by the boundary conditions @xmath30",
    ". we will assume periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath31-direction so that @xmath32 .",
    "the heat baths are modeled through langevin equations and thus we get the following equations of motion : & & m_1j _ 1j=-4 x_1j+x_2j+x_1j-1+x_1j+1 + h^l_j + & & m_l_xj _",

    "a simple way of implementing correlated baths in the simulations is by introducing new dynamical variables @xmath43 for the bath and setting @xmath44 .",
