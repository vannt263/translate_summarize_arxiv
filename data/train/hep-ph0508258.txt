    "the narrow state @xmath0 was discovered by the belle collaboration@xcite in @xmath5 decay and subsequently confirmed by the babar collaboration@xcite .",
    "both the cdf@xcite and the d0 collaboration@xcite saw a clear signal of inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath6 collision . since @xmath0 decays into @xmath7 , it was the most natural to assign @xmath0 to one of the excited charmonia@xcite .",
    "in fact , the experimental study of the @xmath8 mode in @xmath5 decay had been encouraged by theorists , notably eighteen , lane and quigg@xcite , as a means to explore the excited charmonia .",
    "however , experiment has revealed unexpected properties of @xmath0 .",
    "the very narrow width rules out assignment of @xmath0 to a natural spin - parity state ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) since it would quickly decay into @xmath11 . among the unnatural spin - parity states ,",
    "the @xmath12 charmonium of @xmath13 was ruled out by belle@xcite at an early stage through the angular distribution of the final @xmath14@xcite .",
    "if we trust the potential - model calculations of the charmonium mass spectrum from the past , there is no suitable candidate for @xmath0 in the close neighborhood of 3872 mev .",
    "meanwhile , the coincidence of the @xmath0 mass ( @xmath15 mev@xcite ) with the @xmath16 threshold ( @xmath17 mev ) prompted many theorists@xcite to revive the idea of molecular states@xcite and to speculate that @xmath0 may be a loosely bound state of @xmath18 through a color - neutral force .",
    "then the belle collaboration@xcite reported the startling discovery that @xmath0 decays into @xmath19 as well , actually @xmath20 off the @xmath21 resonance peak , with roughly the same branching fraction as @xmath7 .",
    "since any hadron must have a definite charge parity , the dipion @xmath14 in @xmath22 ought to be in @xmath23-wave ( @xmath24 ) , namely , the @xmath25 and its resonance tail in @xmath26 . in the same analysis they saw a signal of the radiative decay mode @xmath27@xcite , reinforcing the @xmath28 assignment for @xmath0 . with the mass difference between @xmath16 and @xmath29 being as large as 8 mev",
    ", isospin violation may be enhanced if a very loosely bound molecule - like state should be formed .",
    "then it would nicely explain the large isospin mixing in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the most recent analysis of the decay angular distributions@xcite favors @xmath30 for @xmath0 among the positive @xmath31 states .",
    "since @xmath18 would be most likely bound in @xmath32-wave , if at all , @xmath33 fits well to the molecule .",
    "the molecule interpretation has gained steam among some theorists for this reason .",
    "if @xmath0 is indeed a molecule state , it would open a large new field in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "most recently , however , a few pieces of crucial experimental information@xcite , though yet preliminary , have appeared against the molecule assignment .",
    "we are now in a rapidly moving state of confusion .    in this paper we cast more doubt on the molecule interpretation of @xmath0 .",
    "we first show that unlike the proton and the neutron inside a deuteron , no long - range potential arises from one - pion exchange between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "though it may sound strange , it is a simple consequence of the numerical accident , @xmath36 , and of the derivative @xmath37 coupling .",
    "this makes the `` deuteron - like molecular binding '' of @xmath38 highly unlikely .",
    "secondly we argue that the observed decay branching of @xmath39 in @xmath5 decay and the inclusive production cross section of @xmath0 in high - energy proton - proton collision are both too large for a loosely bound object of binding energy 1 mev or less .",
    "we then turn to the charmonium option .",
    "we can not offer a quantitative resolution as for the mass spectrum computed in the potential model .",
    "it has been acknowledged that the computation involves large uncertainties near and above the open charm thresholds . in the 1960 s",
    "the elaborate coupled - channel n / d method was developed in the s - matrix theory to compute the spectrum of light hadrons , which were actually the molecule states in the present - day language .",
    "the n / d method in its simple version iterates the born amplitudes in @xmath32-channel .",
    "the computation is very close to the coupled - channel potential problem@xcite .",
    "but we were realized at the end how difficult it was to obtain reliable quantitative results and could not go much beyond semiquantitative analysis in most cases .",
    "the charmonia above the open charm threshold share similar uncertainties though the ambiguity coming from the high - energy tail is more contained .",
    "we leave the difficulty of the @xmath0 mass with the potential model calculation of charmonia to future study .",
    "instead we focus on the production rate and cross section of @xmath0 .",
    "our estimate shows that because of the very loose binding of the molecule , the production rates of the molecule @xmath0 should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than what we see in experiment . in comparison , the charmonium is more easily produced because of a little tighter binding . one obvious obstacle to the charmonium option is the large isospin breaking in the decay @xmath40 .",
    "however , the @xmath21 resonance peak is nearly two full widths outside the phase space boundary .",
    "we ask if there is any chance that this severe kinematic suppression of the isospin - allowed decay into @xmath19 can bring @xmath41 up close to @xmath42 .",
    "our finding is that such chance is not ruled out within the small range of experimental uncertainty in the mass of @xmath0 . equally or even more serious",
    "is the absolute magnitude of the @xmath40 decay rate ; the decay through @xmath3 annihilation should not dominate over the mode @xmath43 to hide them .",
    "if the charmonium mixes with a fair amount of the @xmath44 component , it could generate measurable branching fractions into @xmath45 .",
    "the best scenario that emerges is as follows : the @xmath0 state is the @xmath33 charmonium that is bound primarily with the gluon - exchange force but mixed to @xmath46 of @xmath47 through a light quark exchange .",
    "this scenario will survive even if @xmath0 is above the @xmath16 threshold and the decay @xmath48 indeed occurs .",
    "we must admit that many of the following analysis are only semiquantitative .",
    "this is an inevitable shortcoming due to the relevant long - distance dynamics that we do not really know in details .",
    "we first show that one - pion exchange produces practically no force between @xmath34 and @xmath49 contrary to intuition . in the limit of @xmath50",
    ", there exists only a @xmath51-function potential in the @xmath32-wave channel .",
    "therefore it is incapable of binding @xmath34 and @xmath49 .",
    "let us define the @xmath37 coupling by @xmath52 the value of @xmath53 can be fixed by the @xmath54 decay rate to @xmath55 .",
    "a single pion can be exchanged only in the @xmath56-channel of the @xmath57 scattering .",
    "( see fig . 1 . )    for concreteness , let us examine the @xmath58 exchange potential in @xmath59 .",
    "the one - pion exchange would be normally the primary source of the binding force . in the rest of this paper",
    "we shall write @xmath38 simply as @xmath60 unless it may cause a confusion .",
    "the potential is extracted from the born amplitude near the threshold : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the pion momentum , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the polarizations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "it is important to notice here a peculiarity of kinematics in the pion propagator .",
    "since the decay @xmath67 actually occurs with a tiny @xmath68-value , the denominator of the propagator is practically zero as compared with @xmath69 in the nonrelativistic limit ; @xmath70 where @xmath71 is very small ( @xmath72 mev ) .",
    "let us denote the static limit of the denominator by @xmath73 with the two powers of @xmath62 from the derivative @xmath74 coupling in the numerator , the born amplitude @xmath75 survives only at @xmath76 and varies slowly there .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath75 gives the one - pion exchange potential .",
    "since @xmath77 can occur on mass shell , the principal part of the pion denominator is relevant to the potential : @xmath78 for the @xmath32-wave potential relevant to binding of @xmath60 into a molecule of @xmath33 , only a tiny contribution of @xmath79 survives aside from the @xmath51-function term since the last term ( valid off @xmath80 ) in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) goes away up to @xmath79 after partial - wave projection .- exchange in @xmath81 , the yukawa potential appears rather than the oscillatory potential since the on - shell transition does not occur with @xmath82 .",
    "however , the leading long - range @xmath32-wave potential is @xmath83 instead of @xmath84 and still totally negligible . ]",
    "contrary to the naive expectation , therefore , the one - pion exchange potential is a @xmath51-function in good approximation between @xmath85 and @xmath86 . unlike the one - dimensional @xmath51-function potential",
    ", the three - dimensional @xmath51-function potential can not generate a bound state when one puts it in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the yukawa potential can arise only from `` crossed '' multipion exchange .",
    "although the dipion - exchange potential of an intermediate range plays an important role in tightly bound nuclei@xcite and even in the deuteron by providing a spin - isospin independent force , lack of the long range force would not lead to binding of the deuteron .",
    "therefore the speculation fails that @xmath0 may be an analog of the deuteron on the basis of a long range force@xcite .",
    "swanson@xcite `` appended '' the one - pion exchange potential with a quark - model potential which he calls the `` quark born diagram potential''@xcite .",
    "he turned his quark potential into a meson - meson interaction potential and added to it the standard one - pion exchange potential of range @xmath87 , which should be absent between @xmath34 and @xmath49 according to our argument . for a spatially",
    "extended composite state , it is the force of the longest range that is most sensitive to binding .",
    "it is not clear in his paper how much his quark - model potential is responsible for binding of @xmath0 .",
    "while we are unable to read quantitative details of calculation in his short paper , it appears that some fundamental revision is needed in his calculation of binding , at least in the one - pion exchange part .",
    "the imaginary part of the born amplitude @xmath75 due to the on - shell intermediate state gives an absorptive potential : its @xmath32-wave contribution is small : @xmath88 .",
    "this absorptive potential is nothing other than a tiny channel coupling to @xmath89 by pion emission from @xmath65 . the derivative pion coupling or the @xmath23-wave emission of the pion in @xmath90 is the source of the behavior @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "it is obvious why the one - pion exchange does not lead to the familiar yukawa potential of @xmath93 : the pion emission in @xmath94 can occur without violating energy conservation so that the emitted pion can travel over long distances .",
    "this would otherwise produce a long range potential of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , but the derivative coupling erases them leaving only the @xmath51-function in the small @xmath97 limit .",
    "is it possible to bind @xmath34 and @xmath49 through coupling to the @xmath19 channel ?",
    "in general , a channel coupling can enhance the effective potential for the channel of the strongest force .",
    "for this channel coupling to occur , @xmath34 ( or @xmath98 ) must be exchanged .",
    "( see fig .",
    "since the denominator of the @xmath99 propagator is @xmath100 or larger , the range of this off - diagonal yukawa potential is very short ( @xmath101 fermi ) .",
    "consequently no strong coupling occurs between the @xmath102 and the @xmath19 channel at distances large enough to be relevant to a loosely bound molecule . as for the diagonal potential of @xmath19 ,",
    "the elastic scattering process is the so - called `` disconnected '' quark diagram ( fig .",
    "3 ) or multi - gluon exchange processes .",
    "just as @xmath103 interacts only weakly with @xmath104 , @xmath25 , @xmath21 and so forth even at low energies , elastic @xmath19 scattering is expected to be weak and hardly a source of binding . to summarize",
    ", we see no chance of generating a bound state in the @xmath32-wave @xmath102 channels , no matter how the born diagrams are iterated , by solving the schrdinger equation or the bethe - salpeter equation with or without channel coupling , or by approximating the n - function of the matrix n / d with the born amplitudes .",
    "if there is any relevant channel coupling , it would be to the @xmath3 channel .",
    "the confining potential between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is stronger than the hadron exchange potentials .",
    "the coupling between @xmath60 and @xmath3 occurs through the @xmath107-quark exchange .",
    "( see fig .",
    "4 . ) if this channel coupling is strong enough , @xmath60 and @xmath3 can mix substantially .",
    "even when such a mixing occurs , the primary source of binding is the confining force of gluon exchange between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , not the van der waals force of qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ not the hadron exchange force in the @xmath60 channel .",
    "such a bound state is conceptually not the molecule and dynamically different from it",
    ". we will later discuss this possibility in more detail .",
    "we compare the observed production rates of @xmath0 with the theoretical expectation for the molecule state .",
    "we are limited to semiquantitative discussion here since accurate calculation would require much more information of long - distance dynamics and experimental input than we have at present .",
    "nonetheless we see a serious difficulty .",
    "the @xmath0 mass has been given by the four experimental groups as follows@xcite : @xmath108 olsen@xcite quotes @xmath109 mev as the weighted average from all groups .",
    "we should compare these numbers with @xmath110 mev and @xmath111 mev@xcite .",
    "for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we have added the quoted errors @xmath114 mev of the _ review of particle physics_@xcite since the errors are correlated between @xmath115 and @xmath116 and between @xmath117 and @xmath118 . although the central values are on the side of @xmath119 , even the number from belle that has the highest accuracy is not conclusive as to whether @xmath120 is really above the @xmath16 threshold or not .",
    "we have shown the current ranges of @xmath120 and @xmath121 in fig .",
    "5 .    in order for @xmath0 to be a molecular bound state",
    ", @xmath0 must be below the @xmath16 threshold ; @xmath122 .",
    "however , belle apparently saw a large decay branching to @xmath123 with the preliminary result@xcite , @xmath124 if this result holds , the molecule model ought to be modified into the `` virtual state '' model@xcite . for our discussion of the molecule ,",
    "we proceed with @xmath125 this places the binding energy of @xmath16 in @xmath0 at less than 1 mev .",
    "the production rate of a loosely bound state in decay and scattering is obtained generally by convoluting the bound state wavefunction with a production amplitude of its constituents .",
    "when the range of production dynamics is much shorter than the size of the bound state , the production of the constituents and the formation of a bound state factorize . if @xmath0 is a loosely bound state of @xmath16 , the constituent momenta in the @xmath0 rest frame is @xmath126 .",
    "the constituents are streaming in parallel with practically no relative motion . even after boosting to the overall _ cm _ frame in @xmath5 decay or in @xmath6 collision at small rapidity , the relative momentum is still much smaller than the characteristic momentum over which the production amplitude @xmath127 of @xmath128 varies significantly . in this case",
    "the invariant amplitude of production may be approximated as @xmath129 where we have suppressed dependence of @xmath130 on all other variables .",

    "nonetheless we must address to this question .    since we mean by charmonium the @xmath3 state that is bound primarily by the confining force , mixing of @xmath3 with @xmath60 is not large in a `` clean '' charmonium by definition",

    "the tractable approximation close to the potential model is to represent the n - function of given @xmath327 by the born amplitudes and to set to @xmath328 for the d - function .",
    "one advantage of the n / d method over the potential model is its notational simplicity in discussing channel coupling .",

    "although it is hard to get numerical results in our case , we can make one simple observation about the @xmath3-@xmath60 mixing .",
    "we are interested in the possibility that a large off - diagonal element @xmath340 for @xmath341 causes a strong mixing .",
    "the born diagram for @xmath342 is a light quark exchange ( fig .",

    "the confining potential of gluon exchange for @xmath350 is no weaker than the quark exchange for @xmath351 .",
    "we can thus set a bound on the mixing , @xmath352 if the mixing of @xmath353 really occurs , the binding force would be enhanced by about 60% as a channel coupling effect .",
    "we make the following observation from this exercise : it is possible for the @xmath33 charmonium to contain a @xmath60 component up to one third ( @xmath354 ) .",
    "a stronger mixing is possible only if the force of shorter distances in the elastic @xmath60 channel should play a role in binding .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath355 and @xmath356 should not generate a very large departure from isospin symmetry in the @xmath60 content of @xmath0 since the effective binding force is the integral of the born amplitudes smoothed out over energy , not the born amplitudes themselves at or near @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath60 content of @xmath0 is approximately in @xmath47 .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the binding force due to the channel coupling , determined by @xmath357 is insensitive whether @xmath0 is above or below the @xmath16 threshold .    in the presence of a large mixing , production of @xmath0",

    "the decay @xmath270 is a quark - rearrangement process and the strength of the @xmath60 binding is unimportant . since the @xmath60 component can make up to one third , @xmath40 is more competitive with @xmath318 than in the case of the unmixed pure charmonium . in our dispersion relation of the tree - point function in section iii ,",
    "a large @xmath102 component is present when the coupling @xmath358 is strong and the transition to the @xmath60 intermediate state is easy .",
    "the @xmath215 charmonium mixed with @xmath60 was discussed by meng , gao and chao@xcite in the case that binding is entirely due to the confining force .",
    "we have examined the molecule model and the charmonium model for @xmath0 .",
    "the main motivations of the molecule idea are the coincidence of the @xmath0 mass with @xmath250 and the large isospin violation in the decay modes .",
    "however , there is no long range force to bind @xmath34 and @xmath49 into a deuteron - like state .",
    "the observed production rates of @xmath0 in @xmath5 decay and @xmath6 collision are too large for a very loosely bound state .",
    "on the other hand the charmonium has its share of difficulties ; the mass does not agree with the potential model prediction of the @xmath215 state and the large decay branching for @xmath359 could make the experimental signal of @xmath360 hardly visible .",
    "one resolution appears to be as follows : @xmath0 is bound primarily by the confining force between @xmath105 and @xmath106 which is boosted by the channel coupling to @xmath60 .",
    "production of @xmath0 occurs mostly through its @xmath3 component .",
    "the @xmath60 component is in @xmath47 in good approximation .",
    "the large isospin breaking of the decay mode @xmath216 relative to @xmath19 results from a normal magnitude of isospin breaking due to @xmath361 mass difference that is enhanced by the severe kinematical suppression of the @xmath19 mode .",
    "this picture is very different conceptually from the molecule model or the multiquark model . in this picture",
    ", the binding force comes primarily from @xmath3 and secondarily from the channel coupling .",
    "the elastic @xmath60 channel provides practically no binding force .",
    "this is an important distinction from the viewpoint of hadron spectroscopy because if our picture is right , @xmath0 will not an opening of a flood gate for multiquark or molecule states .",
    "how can we distinguish among the different models and pictures by experiment ?",
    "we should test the particle content of @xmath0 . in the case of the charmonium and the charmonium mixed with @xmath60 of @xmath47 ,",
    "the production rate is the same for @xmath362 and @xmath363 by isospin symmetry as long as it occurs through the dominant interaction @xmath364 .",
    "independent of dynamics , therefore , we expect for the charmonium @xmath0 , @xmath365 this equality should hold equally well in the case of the large mixing between @xmath3 and @xmath60 since @xmath0 is produced primarily through its @xmath3 component whose @xmath324 is large . for the molecule @xmath0 where the @xmath60 component has a sizable isospin breaking , the equality would be violated since the decay amplitudes into @xmath47 and 1 , or",
    "@xmath366 and @xmath29 , are dynamical independent .",
    "if the molecule @xmath0 is made as @xmath367 we can express the decay amplitudes for @xmath178 as @xmath368 then the decay amplitude for @xmath369 is obtained by isospin rotation : @xmath370 the color of the spectator quark ( @xmath371 ) matches that of the @xmath106-quark from @xmath372 in @xmath373 and @xmath374 , but not in @xmath375 nor @xmath376 . in the @xmath377 expansion , therefore , @xmath378 .",
