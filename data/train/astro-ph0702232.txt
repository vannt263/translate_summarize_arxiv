    "measurements have shown the existence of bright rings around sunspots ( bonnet et al .",
    "1978 ; rast et al .  1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "the rings appear one spot radius beyond the spots and are reported to be about 10k warmer than the photosphere .",
    "there is a clear trend that larger spots have brighter rings .",
    "we shall discuss in the following whether simple mean - field models of more or less flat sunspots do develop such rings or not .",
    "the model concerns a horizontal layer with top and bottom at depths @xmath0 and @xmath1 below the photosphere . in our computations @xmath2  mm is fixed , slightly beneath the typical depth of wilson depression .",
    "the fluid is assumed to be a perfect gas .",
    "density and temperature at the top ( @xmath3 ) and bottom ( @xmath4 ) boundaries are prescribed with the solar structure model by stix & skaley ( 1990 ) .",
    "the reference atmosphere is approximated by adiabatic profiles , @xmath5 here the gravity is @xmath6  cms@xmath7 , @xmath8 is the layer depth ( here 15 mm ) , @xmath9 is the vertical coordinate , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are specific heat and adiabaticity index defined by the condition that the bottom temperature and density are exactly reproduced , i.e. @xmath12 the entropy equation with @xmath13 is @xmath14 the sunspot darkness is usually explained in terms of convective heat transport suppressed by magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , the eddy diffusivities in the model depend on the magnetic field ( cf .",
    "rdiger & kitchatinov 2000 ) .",
    "this dependence describes a steady decrease of the turbulent diffusivities with the magnetic field amplitude .",
    "hence @xmath15 where @xmath16 is nonmagnetic diffusivity and the quenching function @xmath17 depends on the field strength normalized to the energy equipartition value , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the rms turbulent velocity .",
    "any anisotropy of the eddy diffusivities is neglected .",
    "the depth profiles of the equipartition field , @xmath20 , and the ( nonmagnetic ) diffusivities are written in accordance with the mixing - length approximation , which yields @xmath21 where @xmath22 has been defined in ( [ 1 ] ) while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the thermal diffusivity and the equipartition field on the top boundary . a marginal value for thermal convection , @xmath25@xmath26/s , was taken for the diffusivity , and @xmath27 gauss .",
    "the density runs from @xmath28 g/@xmath29 at the top to @xmath30 g/@xmath29 at the bottom , and the temperature varies from 14,000 k to 120,000 k.    the horizontal boundaries are stress - free and impenetrable . for the magnetic field",
    "a vacuum condition is used for the top while the field is assumed vertical on the bottom .",
    "thermal conditions are the black - body radiation on the top and constant heat flux ( @xmath31gs@xmath32 ) at the bottom . if wall boundaries are used we assume zero stress , zero normal velocity , and superconductor outside .    a simplified model was used to probe the possibility of reproducing bright rings by heat transport alone . in this model",
    "the velocity is put to zero , the spot - like structure of the magnetic field is prescribed and stationary and the diffusion equation for the entropy is solved .",
    "it is a rather flat spot with an aspect ratio @xmath33 .",
    "the spot of this model has a magnetic flux of @xmath34mx and a depth of about 10 mm .",
    "the surface brightness at the initial state is uniform and equals @xmath35 .",
    "the brightness of the region occupied by magnetic field decreases due to magnetic quenching of the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the normalized surface brightness approaches the profile shown by the solid line in fig.[f3 ] ( left panel ) already after several hours and varies slowly after this time .",
    "the profile does not show any bright ring .",
    "the further evolution depends on the thermal conditions imposed on the wall boundary .",
    "the boundary condition ( zero heat flux across the boundary ) ensures that in the steady state the total irradiance from the surface equals the heat supply at the bottom ( @xmath36 ) . in the steady solution the heat flux blocked by the spot can reemerge _ for flat spots _ as a bright ring ( eschrich & krause 1977 ) .",
    "figure[f3 ] ( right ) shows that the luminosity does indeed recover after the initial reduction but it needs a very long time which is of the order of the kelvin - helmholtz time ( @xmath37  yrs for our model ) .",
    "the reason for this long time scale is the high heat capacity of the solar interior .",
    "the time passed before the rise in the surface irradiance can be seen is much longer than lifetimes of sunspots .",
    "steady solutions of the heat transport equation are thus not relevant for sunspots .",
    "also flatter spot models do not show any bright rings .",
    "for a more consistent mhd model for sunspots we work with the anelasticity condition , @xmath38 , and the complete momentum equation together with the induction equation @xmath39          the vertical size of the simulated spots is comparable to their diameter",
    ". the resulting mean ` meridional circulation ' is convergent on the top near the spots and it makes downdrafts beneath the spots in agreement with results of heliotomography ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , bottom ) .",
    "the amplitude of the flow is about 800  ms@xmath40 .",
    "the flow direction becomes divergent at larger radial distances .",
    "the field strength in the spot is about 2700 gauss .",
    "brightness and field strength are almost uniform in the central parts of the spots but they change rapidly with radius beyond the umbra.      a comparison of figs.[f5 ] and fig.[f7 ] shows that the position of the ring maximum is at the radius where the horizontal surface flow changes its direction and an upwards directed subsurface flow appears . at the same radius",
    "the surface field strength has a minimum .",
    "hence , the upward flow carries extra heat from beneath _ and _ the reduced field strength increases the diffusive heat flux due to reduced magnetic quenching of the thermal diffusivity ( [ 7 ] ) . if the flow is switched off to probe its contribution to the bright rings they do not disappear .",
    "we conclude that both the flow and the reduced diffusivity quenching contribute to the resulting bright rings .",
    "the contribution by the circulation should basically be steady .",
    "observations can help to decide between the two possible explanations for the rings by finding out whether the rings around big spots are decaying on a time scale of some days or not .",
    "for the time of 3 days in the runs for initial fields of 400 ( full line ) , 500 ( dashed ) , and 600gauss ( dotted ) .",
    "all runs show bright rings which are more pronounced for larger spots .",
