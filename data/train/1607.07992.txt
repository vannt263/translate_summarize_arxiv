    "the realization of artificial photosynthesis hinges on our ability to engineer materials and devices which can effectively convert solar energy into fuels  @xcite . since the discovery of photocatalytic water splitting more than four decades ago  @xcite titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath0 ) has been a lead contender in this field , and has found applications in a variety of cutting - edge research areas  @xcite . as water is ubiquitous in all these applications it is not surprising that numerous studies have been devoted to understanding the physics of the interface between tio@xmath0 and h@xmath0o , particularly the rutile ( 110 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "however in the context of nanotechnology the anatase ( 101 ) surface is even more interesting , since this is the most common surface in nanostructured tio@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question in this area is whether h@xmath0o molecules adsorbed on the anatase surface are intact ( molecular adsorption ) , or dissociated into a hydroxyl group and a proton ( dissociative adsorption ) . until very recently experimental and theoretical studies",
    "consistently promoted the notion that only molecular adsorption occurs on the pristine anatase ( 101 ) surface .",
    "in fact , the density - functional theory ( dft ) study of ref .",
    "@xcite found molecular adsorption to be energetically favorable over dissociation by 0.44  ev/0.28  ev per h@xmath0o molecule ( at low / monolayer coverage , respectively ) .",
    "a few years later the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded in favor of the molecular adsorption scenario , based on their analysis of x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and temperature - programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiments .",
    "furthermore , apart from a couple of exceptions  @xcite , most computational studies continue to find molecular adsorption to be energetically favorable  @xcite .",
    "more recently , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments combined with dft calculations identified molecular water on the anatase surface at very low coverage  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of stm images for higher coverages proved more challenging due to the appearance of an unexpected 2@xmath12 superstructure .",
    "then , in contrast with the prevailing view of molecular adsorption of water on anatase , the authors of a recent high - resolution xps study  @xcite reported the presence of oh groups at the surface , and challenged the accepted model of the interface . from an analysis of the xps spectral intensities the authors of ref",

    "our approach consists of calculating the o-@xmath3 core - level spectra of interface models where water is adsorbed either molecularly or dissociatively , and comparing our _ ab initio _ spectra to the experimental data of ref .",
    "the present analysis is motivated by the very high accuracy ( @xmath40.2  ev ) that can now be achieved in dft calculations of core - electron binding energies , as demonstrated by recent work  @xcite .",
    "as we show below , the comparison between our calculated spectra and experiment provides evidence for the presence of dissociated water in the experiments of ref .",

    "this finding prompted us to re - examine the factual evidence underlying the molecular model of the tio@xmath0:h@xmath0o interface  @xcite , namely the unfavorable energetics calculated for dissociative adsorption and the measured stm images .",
    "we found that the energetics of h@xmath0o dissociation on anatase is altered when two water molecules are adsorbed on adjacent sites . in these conditions",
    "the energetic cost of dissociation is compensated by the energy gain due to the formation of the h - bonded complex ho@xmath5h@xmath0o , and dissociative adsorption becomes possible .",
    "this h - bonded complex also leads to a 2@xmath12 superstructure like that observed in the stm images of ref .",

    "for the sake of accuracy , adsorption energy calculations were also performed with the pbe0 hybrid functional  @xcite .",
    "core - level shifts were calculated as differences in dft total energies between systems containing a core - hole , as obtained by replacing the pseudopotential of a given oxygen atom by one containing a hole in the 1@xmath6 level  @xcite . in order to minimize the unphysical interaction of charged replicas  @xcite we used model systems containing up to 432 atoms and 3200 electrons . as in experiment",
    "we can determine core - electron binding energies only modulo a constant , which here we choose such that the calculated bulk o-1@xmath6 peak is aligned to the experimental spectra .",

    "@xmath9 is the o-@xmath3 binding energy of the atom @xmath10 at a distance @xmath11 below the surface , @xmath12 is the dirac delta function , and the exponential accounts for the finite escape depth @xmath13 of the photoelectrons  @xcite . in the sum we explicitly included the contributions of the adsorbates and those of the 6 topmost tio@xmath0 layers of the slab",
    "in order to also describe the contribution of bulk tio@xmath0 far from the surface , we added the contributions from an infinite number of `` virtual '' atoms , whose positions were determined by the bulk anatase lattice .",
    "the o-1@xmath6 binding energy of virtual atoms was set to the average value taken over the central 4 tio@xmath0 layers of our slab model .",

    "two important exceptions appear as satellites at 530.42  and  530.76  ev , indicated by arrows .",
    "these satellites arise from the structural relaxation taking place at the surface  @xcite .",
    "the fivefold coordinated ti atoms at the surface relax towards the substrate , causing a 0.1    contraction of the ti  o bond formed with a nearest neighbor o atom underneath ( indicated in blue ) .",
    "this contraction is responsible for an increase in the o-1@xmath6 binding energy by 0.59  ev with respect to bulk ( blue arrow ) .",
    "similarly the surface relaxation also causes a distortion in the second o layer ( marked in green ) , raising these atoms by 0.34     out of their ideal planar bonding with the 3 ti neighbors .",

    "this feature is explained as follows .",
    "the oh group obtained from water dissociation interacts strongly with a neighboring h@xmath0o molecule .",
    "this leads to the formation of a ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex carrying a distinct spectral fingerprint ( gray shaded curve in fig .  [ fig.3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the hydrogen bond between oh and h@xmath0o ( length 1.71   ) reduces the o-@xmath3 binding energy on the coordinated h@xmath0o molecule by 0.64  ev compared to the other water molecules .",
    "the reduction of core - level binding energies by h - bonds is a well - documented effect  @xcite .",

    "@xcite may be induced by the x - ray irradiation  @xcite , our present finding requires us to critically re - examine previous evidence for molecular adsorption . in this spirit",
    "we first consider the calculation of the energetics of water adsorption .",
    "careful test calculations indicated that the adsorption energy is rather sensitive to the thickness of the tio@xmath0 model slab and the sampling of the surface brillouin zone ( appendix  [ app.conv ] ) . in the case of the undissociated water monolayer",
    "our converged adsorption energy ( obtained using 8 tio@xmath0 layers and a 2@xmath12 surface brillouin zone mesh ) is 0.64  ev per water molecule . at the same time we found that the energy required for dissociating one in four water molecules , so as to obtain the model interface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , is only 60  mev .",
    "this surprisingly small energy penalty results from the balance between the cost of splitting h@xmath0o and the energy gained by forming the h - bond in the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex discussed above .",
    "this is similar to the case of water adsorption on rutile tio@xmath0 , where computational and experimental studies provided evidence for such complexes  @xcite .",
    "we found a similar trend for the case of an isolated water dimer . in this latter case",
    "we calculated the energy required to form the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex to be 150  mev , i.e.  at very low coverage complex - assisted dissociation is only slightly less favorable than at full coverage .",
    "given that the calculated total energies of the undissociated and of the partially dissociated monolayers differ by only 60  mev , we proceed with an analysis of quantum nuclear zero - point effects .",
    "for this purpose we investigated the vibrational eigenmodes for two model surfaces , with h@xmath0o adsorbed either molecularly or dissociatively .",
    "we found that upon dissociation the zero - point energy decreases by 80  mev .",
    "this decrease can be understood by noting that the contribution to the vibrational energy from the bending mode of the h@xmath0o molecule at 1580  @xmath16 is removed upon dissociation . after taking this zero - point correction into account ,",
    "the partially ( 25% ) dissociated water monolayer becomes marginally more stable ( 20  mev ) than the molecular monolayer .",
    "similarly at low coverage the formation of the h - complex is only marginally unstable ( by 70  mev ) and could be temperature - activated .",
    "the above suggests that vibrational spectroscopy could be employed to quantify the fraction of dissociated water , through the relative intensities of the bending mode at 1580  @xmath16 ( present only for molecular h@xmath0o ) and the stretching modes at 3700  @xmath16 ( present for both molecular and dissociated h@xmath0o ) .",
    "obviously the energetic differences here are so small that these results may be sensitive to the choice of the exchange and correlation functional , and may be affected by the neglect of dispersion forces , subsurface defects , and step edges  @xcite . to demonstrate this aspect we repeated full structural relaxations of the interface models using the pbe0 hybrid functional  @xcite which previously was shown to improve the accuracy of calculations of the vibrational properties of liquid water  @xcite .",
    "interestingly the formation energy of the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex starting from two water molecules is reduced when using the pbe0 hybrid functional ( appendix  [ app.pbe0 ] ) , further demonstrating that this complex plays an important role in the structure of water on tio@xmath0 .",
    "our present analysis of the adsorption energetics indicates that there may not necessarily be a contradiction between the spectroscopic observation of dissociated water and dft calculations of adsorption energies .",
    "previous calculations taken as evidence against dissociative adsorption , although technically correct , did not consider the possibility of forming the energetically favorable ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex , thus reaching conclusions that water adsorbs molecularly .",
    "our calculations indicate that complex - assisted dissociation is slightly more favorable than molecular adsorption .",
    "having identified that the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex might play an important role in the adsorption of water on anatase tio@xmath0 ( 101 ) , we wanted to check whether this complex might be related to the 2@xmath12 superstructure observed in the stm experiments of ref .",

    "further reduces this difference . using a 2@xmath12 @xmath22-point sampling and an 8-layer tio@xmath0 slab we obtain adsorption energies of 0.69  ev and 0.42  ev for molecular and dissociated h@xmath0o .",
    "the obtained difference in adsorption energies , 0.27  ev , is 0.11  ev smaller than the unconverged case . as a footnote",
    ", we note that our calculations highlight a potential danger with using only the molecular adsorption energy to test convergence , since this quantity changes by less than 0.001  ev on moving from a 4 to a 6-layer slab .",
    "our work has shown that careful numerical convergence , combined with consideration of quantum nuclear zero - point effects , leads to energetic differences between molecular and partially dissociated models of the tio@xmath0:h@xmath0o interface which are very small ; at monolayer coverage , the partially dissociated monolayer is favorable by 20  mev , while at low coverage the cost of forming the h - bonded ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex was found to be 70  mev .",
    "these energy differences are so small that the results may be sensitive to the choice of the exchange and correlation functional . to explore this point",
    "further we decided to repeat our calculations of adsorption geometries and energies using the pbe0 hybrid functional  @xcite , which has previously been shown to improve the accuracy of calculations of the vibrational properties of liquid water  @xcite .",
    "a difficulty with hybrid functional approaches , particularly when combined with planewave basis sets , is their significant computational expense as compared to local or semilocal functionals .",
    "furthermore , the implementation of hybrid functional calculations in the current general release of ` quantum espresso ` is not compatible with ultrasoft pseudopotentials .",
    "therefore , we employed a reduced computational setup for the hybrid functional calculations , and used norm - conserving pseudopotentials . in order that we might assess the effect of the exact exchange",
    "directly , we also performed additional calculations with an identical computational setup at the pbe level of theory .",
    "finally we compare the values calculated within the reduced computational setup with the fully converged ( conv . )",

    "a converged value of 100  ry was used for the planewave kinetic energy cutoff of the wavefunctions .",
    "a 1@xmath11 surface cell was used to construct structural models , as for the fully - converged setup ; however the slab thickness was reduced to 4 tio@xmath0 layers and the brillouin zone sampled at the @xmath21-point only .",
    "the lattice parameters used to construct the slab were obtained by relaxing anatase tio@xmath0 in bulk with the norm - conserving pseudopotentials at the pbe level of theory , sampling the brillouin zone on a 6@xmath16@xmath16 mesh .",
    "the periodic slab replicas were separated by a vacuum region of 9   .",
    "full geometry optimizations were performed exactly as in the fully - converged setup , with the bottom tio@xmath0 layer fixed in order to mimic a semi - infinite layer and carried out until the forces on all the other atoms were below 30  mev /  .        the structural models considered at the pbe0 level of theory are shown in fig .  [ fig.app4 ] .",
    "we obtained the fully - relaxed geometries of ( a ) molecularly - adsorbed h@xmath0o at low coverage , ( b ) dissociated ( intrapair ) h@xmath0o at low coverage , ( c ) two molecularly - adsorbed h@xmath0o molecules and ( d ) the h - bonded ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex .",

    "our hybrid functional calculations have produced some interesting results .",
    "first , comparing the energies for molecular and dissociative adsorption at the reduced computational setup , we find that the pbe0 hybrid functional predicts an increased stability of dissociative adsorption compared to pbe .",
    "overall the difference in molecular and dissociative adsorption energies decreases by 0.10  ev in the pbe0 calculations [ fig .",
    "[ fig.app4](e ) ] . further comparing the pbe calculations obtained for the reduced and converged computational setups we find this same difference to decrease by 0.11  ev .",
    "therefore we expect that the calculated difference between molecular and dissociative h@xmath0o adsorption with pbe0 of 0.28  ev represents an upper bound , and further converging these calculations with @xmath22-points and slab thickness would further reduce this difference .",
    "second , considering the energy cost of forming the complex [ fig .",
    "[ fig.app4](f ) ] , we again find a reduction on moving to the pbe0 level of theory , by 0.14  ev .",
    "this reduction can be attributed to the lower cost of water dissociation in pbe0 ( 0.10  ev , as discussed above ) and to a stronger hydrogen bond in the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex ( 0.04  ev ) . again noting that the energy cost of forming the complex decreases by 0.26  ev on moving from the reduced to the converged computational setups at the pbe level of theory , we are left with a possibility that a fully - converged pbe0 calculation would predict the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex to be stable even before considering the vibrational contribution to the energy .    as well as",
    "adsorption energetics , the full geometry relaxations provide insight into the different descriptions of the structure of the h - bonded ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex in pbe and pbe0 .",
    "we found that the length of the h - bond [ dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig.app4](d ) ] increases by just 0.012    on moving from pbe to pbe0 .",
    "this observation can be explained simply by noting that the formation of the ho@xmath5h@xmath0o complex is determined by the competition of the covalent ti  o bond of the hydroxyl , the covalent ti  o bond of the h@xmath0o molecule , and the h - bond between the hydroxyl and h@xmath0o molecule .",
    "given the enhanced strength of covalent bonds compared to h - bonds , it is not surprising that there are fewer changes observed on moving from a semilocal to nonlocal description of exchange compared to that observed for homogeneous molecular water  @xcite , where h - bonds dominate .",
    "clearly , in light of the discussion of numerical convergence in the previous section , the values presented in table  [ tab.app1 ] and figs .  [ fig.app4](e )  and  ( f ) can not be considered definitive .",
    "however , the hybrid functional calculations clearly show that the energetic balance between molecular and dissociative h@xmath0o adsorption on the anatase tio@xmath0 ( 101 ) surface is extremely delicate . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that current first - principles calculations can not rule out the possibility of water dissociation on this surface .",
    ", width=283 ]    figure  [ fig.app5 ] shows the calculated stm image of purely molecularly - adsorbed water .",
    "each adsorbed water molecule appears as a bright spot in the spectrum , with the calculated image thus showing a 1@xmath11 periodicity . in order to account for the experimentally - observed 2@xmath12 periodicity using only molecular water , it is necessary for water not to adsorb at adjacent sites but rather be staggered , as proposed in ref .",
    "in 1998 , the authors of ref .  @xcite considered previous experimental studies of the anatase tio@xmath0:h@xmath0o interface and noted that `` on the basis of this experimental information , different models of the anatase surface and of water adsorption at this surface have been proposed , but no clear picture has emerged yet . '' subsequently , to our knowledge three experimental works were published aimed at obtaining a clearer picture of the behavior of water on well - defined anatase ( 101 ) surfaces : a combined temperature - programmed desorption and xps study  @xcite , an stm study  @xcite and another xps study published more recently  @xcite .",
    "our current work supports the interpretation of the xps measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite as evidence for water dissociation .",
    "we also showed that features found in the stm images measured in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the 2@xmath12 superstructure and zigzag pattern ) can also be explained in terms of a partially dissociated monolayer of h@xmath0o , although the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite provided an alternative explanation in terms of a purely molecular monolayer .",
    "the remaining experimental work is the tpd / xps study of ref .",
    "@xcite . first considering the xps , comparing the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite to ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the latter has achieved the higher resolution in measuring the o-@xmath3 spectrum .",
    "this higher resolution is essential to discern the presence of oh groups , since they appear only as a shoulder to the bulk tio@xmath0 peak [ c.f .",
    "2(b ) of our work ] .",
    "partial dissociation of h@xmath0o stabilized by h - bonding interactions also provides an explanation for the coverage - dependent shift of the molecular h@xmath0o peak observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since our calculations showed that this feature is sensitive to intermolecular h - bonding .",
    "now turning to the tpd measurements , the tpd spectrum of hydrated anatase shows a broad peak at 250k , and additional features at 190 and 160 k at coverages greater than one monolayer .",
    "in contrast to experiments performed on the rutile ( 110 ) surface  @xcite , there is no peak at @xmath15500  k. the absence of this peak was considered significant , since the 500  k feature in rutile was assigned to dissociated water in ref .",
    "however , as noted by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the hydroxyls found on the rutile ( 110 ) surface are thought to form at o vacancies ; therefore , it is not clear how the behavior of hydroxyl species formed at defects on rutile should correspond to that of dissociated water on the stoichiometic anatase surface .",
    "indeed we note that the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite found an adsorption energy of 0.94  ev for dissociated h@xmath0o on the defective rutile ( 110 ) surface , which is larger than the adsorption energies calculated for water on stoichiometric anatase .",
    "in fact , as shown by the xps measurements at different temperatures reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hydroxyl groups on the anatase ( 101 ) surface observed by the xps have all been desorbed by 400 k.    the question remains therefore of how to assign the broad peak observed in the tpd spectrum at 250  k. the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite assigned the peak as originating from the desorption molecular water only , on the basis that the adsorption energy obtained by them through a redhead analysis was found to be similar to that obtained in the previous theoretical work of ref .",
    "however , if the adsorption energies of molecular and dissociated h@xmath0o are similar , as showed by our work , the broad peak at 250  k could equally be assigned to the desorption of both molecular and dissociated h@xmath0o .",
