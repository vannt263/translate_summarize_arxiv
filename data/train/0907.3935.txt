    "the properties of the dilepton and real photon production in relativistic heavy ion collisions constitute a significant fraction among the various signatures of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "being produced at all stages of the collision and practically lacking the final state interactions , they convey dual information . from one side ,",
    "their production rate and kinematics are sensitive to the properties of the surrounding matter : dominance of the partonic or hadronic constituents , temperature , density , flow etc . in turn",
    ", the hot and dense matter is expected to affect spectral functions of the dilepton emission .",
    "disentangling these two effects poses both interpetational and experimental problems : the `` conventional '' sources of the observed effects need to be understood , and the small production rates and large backgrounds require large integrated luminosity measurements .",
    "the mentioned difficulties are the reason behind the scarce results on direct photons collected so far at the sps .",
    "15 - 20@xmath4 upper limits ( 95@xmath4 cl ) on the excess over hadronic sources ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays ) were set by wa80  @xcite and  @xcite in the central s - au collisions at 200 a @xmath8 .",
    "the most significant result  @xcite is the observation of up to @xmath9 excess for @xmath10 in pb - pb collision at 158 a @xmath8 .",
    "it is well described by theoretical models involving pqcd photons and thermal emission both from hadron gas and qgp  @xcite , but the interpretation is ambiguous : the thermal photon emission rate is determined by the temperature and close to the transition point both phases provide similar rates .",
    "the situation is much more advanced in the dilepton sector .",
    "conventionally , its mass spectrum is separated into three regions , distingished by their dominant contributions in p - p and p - a collisions : ( i ) low mass region ( lmr , @xmath11 ) where the emission is mostly determined by the leptonic decays of vector mesons ( resonant part ) and non - resonant contribution from dalitz decays ; ( ii ) intermediate mass range ( imr , @xmath12 ) composed of drell - yan dileptons and pairs coming from uncorrelated decays of open charm ( mostly @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons ) ; ( iii ) high mass range ( hmr , @xmath15 ) dominated by the heavy quarkonia and drell - yan pairs .",
    "this part of the spectrum was covered by @xcite in this volume and will not be considered here .      with arrival of the ion",
    "beams on cern sps all dilepton experiments observed an enhancement of the @xmath16 production with respect to the extrapolation from p - a collision .",
    "helios/3  @xcite and na38  @xcite experiments reported the continuum excess in @xmath17 , comparing the s - w and s - u collisions at 200 a @xmath8 respectively with p - w interactions at the same energy .",
    "an important milestone was set by the ceres experiment which measured electron pairs using a system of two rich detectors .",
    "it observed a strong ( @xmath18 ) lmr excess in @xmath19 production in s - au collision  @xcite with respect to the `` cocktail '' of hadronic decays  @xcite , well describing the p - be and p - au spectra  @xcite .",
    "the triggered theoretical activity , trying to describe these data , was not successful until the appearence of calculations involving in - medium @xmath20 annihilation via a modified @xmath21 spectral function .",
    "the model  @xcite , exploring the idea of the brown - rho scaling  @xcite , assumed a decrease of the @xmath21 pole mass close to the chiral symmetry restoration point , while  @xcite predicted a brodening of the @xmath21 , with significant contribution from the interactions with baryons .",
    "unfortunately , the low statistics and insufficient ( @xmath22 ) mass resolution did not allow to give preference to one of the models . the excess was later confirmed ( @xmath23 ) in pb - au interactions at 158 a @xmath8 .",

    "the possible explanation of the significantly larger excess at lower energy is the higher baryonic density due to the stronger stopping .    in the same period",
    "another important result was provided by na50  @xcite . using the muon spectrometer inherited from na38 and equipped with a very selective @xmath27 trigger system",
    ", it observed in pb - pb collisions at 158 a @xmath8 an imr excess with respect to the expected drell - yan and open charm contributions .",
    "these latter were extrapolated from the p - a dimuon spectra at 450  @xmath8 .",
    "combined with the reanalyzed s - u data of the na38 , the excess showed an approximately linear rise with the number of participants , reaching a factor 2 in the central pb - pb collisions .",
    "the excess , which had a kinematics resembling that of the open charm , could be accounted for  @xcite either by some mechanism enhancing the latter contribution in the na50 acceptance window or by the long sought thermal dimuons  @xcite .",

    "its upgrade of the na50 setup by a radiation tolerant silicon pixel vertex tracker ( vt )  @xcite placed in a 2.5 tesla dipole magnet between the target and the hadron absorber provided numerous advantages with respect to its predecessors .",
    "particularly , by matching the muons from the spectrometer to tracks reconstructed in the vt , na60 significantly improved the dimuon mass resolution ( from @xmath28  80  @xmath29 to @xmath2820  @xmath29 at @xmath30 mass ) and was able to measure the offset of the muons wrt the production vertex with a resolution of @xmath2850  @xmath31 : enough to distinguish between prompt dimuons and those coming from the open charm decays .    in 2003 na60",

    "such a faster than linear rise of the excess with multiplicity is compatible with emission from the annihilation process .",

    "the fits are done in terms of multiplicative factors for the reference cross sections .",
    "the latter are defined in the following way : for the drell - yan , it reproduces the cross sections measured above the @xmath48 by na3  @xcite and na50  @xcite , while for the open charm the result of a similar fit to na50 p - a data at 450 @xmath8  @xcite rescaled to 158 @xmath8 by pythia is used ( @xmath49 ) . due to the insufficient high - mass drell - yan statistics ,",

    "the results are fully compatible with observations of na50 in pb - pb data  @xcite : while the drell - yan contribution agrees well with the expectations ( and the data above @xmath48 ) , a strong excess with a mass shape resembling the open charm contribution is found .",
    "the global fit to both data sets leads to the enhancement factors @xmath50 for drell - yan and @xmath51 for open charm . to clarify the origin of this excess",

    "the global fit to low and high current data sets leads to enhancement factor of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the prompt and open charm samples .",

    "for this reason , in the differential analysis the kinematic distributions for open charm and drell - yan are taken from pythia spectra , while for the dependence on centrality both are assumed to scale with the number of binary collisions extracted from the measured number of @xmath3 events in a given @xmath58 bin ( corrected for the suppression ) .",
    "the imr excess is defined as the difference between the measured signal and the sum of these two contributions .",
    "the dependence of the excess on the number of the collision participants shows a faster than linear scaling with the number of binary collisions ( with excess / dy reaching a factor @xmath59 for the most central with @xmath60 ) , but is slower than quadratic increase with the squared number of participants@xcite . as in the case of the lmr excess",

    "all hadrons - @xmath6 ,  @xmath30 ,  @xmath21 ( defined as the peak on top of the lmr excess ) and @xmath44 show the rise of @xmath66 with mass characteristic for the `` blue - shift '' due to radial flow .",
    "the deviations @xmath67 from nearly linear scaling with mass ( @xmath68 ) are compatible with different freeze - out times of the corresponding hadrons due to their different coupling to the expanding medium .",
    "this is supported by a `` blast - wave '' analysis  @xcite : the @xmath44 decouples first , when the flow is not yet fully developed , while the @xmath21 , whith its strong coupling to pions , freezes out last and profits from the full flow ( with @xmath66 reaching @xmath69 in the most central collisions ) .",
    "a similar increase of @xmath66 with mass is observed for the lmr excess . since , due to the `` soft point '' in the equation - of - state @xcite the ( eventually produced )",
    "partonic phase at sps energies is not expected to develop significant flow , this suggest an emission from the thermalized hadronic expanding gas .",
    "surprisingly , the rise of the excess @xmath66 with mass changes to the flat behaviour after the sudden drop by nearly @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "the most plausible explanation of this effect is that the excess at these masses is dominated by thermal dimuons from a partonic source lacking significant flow . -3.4",
    "mm    -3 mm    -3 mm such an interpetation is supported by the theoretical calculations .",
    "the models labeled hees/ rapp @xcite and renk / rupppert  @xcite assume the dominant contribution in the lmr to be @xmath72 annililation via modified @xmath21 spectral function ( @xcite and  @xcite respectively ) , while the imr excess is defined by the combination of 4 @xmath73 annihilation processes and a significant contribution from the annihilation in the partonic phase .",
    "they differ in the estimate of the fraction of the latter :  @xcite puts emphasis on chiral mixing via the @xmath74 process , keeping the partonic contribution within @xmath75 ( depending on the fireball evolution scenario ) , while  @xcite assumes @xmath76 contribution from the partonic phase .",
    "the model dusling / zahed  @xcite uses hydrodynamic calculation with a virial expansion for the rates in the hadronic phase and @xmath77 annihilation in the partonic one .",
    "the latter contributes @xmath78 to the imr excess .",
    "all models roughly agree with the data .",
    "the differences at low masses reflect the differences in the tail of the @xmath21 spectrum ( @xcite with a strong effect from baryons provides the best description ) .",
    "a detailed comparison of these models with data in narrow @xmath32 bins is contained in  @xcite .",
    "the thermal origin of the excess is further supported by the abscence of any polarization in the excess dimuons@xcite .",
    "all coefficients of the @xmath79 parameterization are found to be compatible with zero , which is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition of the emission from an isotropic thermalized source .      despite various predictions  ( @xcite and",
    "references therein ) , no anomaly in the pole positions and widths of the @xmath30 and @xmath44 mesons was observed so far within the experimental reach of na60 . due to the longer lifetimes",
    ", only a small fraction of these mesons produced in the medium contributes to the observed dilepton signal . for this reason any in - medium modifications will have much weaker effect on the measured @xmath30 and @xmath44 spectra than for the @xmath21 . besides that , the possible",
    "broadening of the @xmath30 would be practically inobservable since it would merge with the @xmath21 peak .",
    "instead one could look for the deficit of low-@xmath80 @xmath30 dileptons ( with strongest contribution from in - medium decays ) in the nominal pole position .",
    "na60 has reported the first observation of such an effect  @xcite for the @xmath30 . while the @xmath80 spectra of the @xmath44 in the whole @xmath32 range and of the @xmath30 at @xmath81 are perfectly thermal and agree very well with the `` blast - wave '' fits at all centralities ,",
    "the low-@xmath32 @xmath30 spectra become gradually depleted as centrality increases , with almost complete disappearence of the @xmath30 with @xmath82 for the most central collisions .",
    "significant attention was paid recently to so called @xmath44-puzzle : the disagreement between @xmath83 measured by na49  @xcite and @xmath84 measured by na50  @xcite .",
    "na50 , whose @xmath44 acceptance is limited by @xmath85 sees nearly twice the yield observed by na49 whose statistics is limited by @xmath86 , with a significant difference in the inverse slope parameters : @xmath87 vs. @xmath88 in the central pb - pb collisions .",
    "recent measurements by ceres  @xcite of @xmath44 production in central pb - au collisions at 158 a @xmath8 both in the @xmath89 and @xmath19 channels are consistent with each other and seem to confirm the na49 results ( although with large errors on the @xmath66 in @xmath19 ) .",

    "[ fig : phi]_(left ) _ ) yield per participant than na50 and slighly stronger than both na49 and ceres do .",
    "taking into account that na50 recently reanalysed its pb - pb data and confirmed the previous results  @xcite , at present ,",
    "it is difficult to reconcile all of the observations into a coherent picture , albeit there is some hint for a possible physics mechanism leading to a difference in the two channels  @xcite . -3 mm    -4 mm    -4 mm [ fig : phi ]",
    "a summary of dilepton measurements at the sps was presented .",
    "the most prominent result is the excess observed in heavy ion collisions at all masses below the @xmath3 .",
    "its most plausible explanation by the production of thermal dimuons is supported by the thermal - like spectra both in mass and in transverse momentum , the lack of any polarisation and by the reasonable agreement with theory . at low masses ,",
    "the @xmath91 pairs are dominated by @xmath92 annihilation via the short - lived @xmath21 meson broadened by the hot medium ( the brown - rho scenario of a dropping @xmath21 mass is ruled out by the data ) .",
    "the monotonic rise of @xmath66 with mass up to @xmath93 with a sudden drop and then stabilization at higher masses , seen by na60 , suggests that in the imr the dominant contribution is due to the @xmath77 anniliation in the partonic phase , when the radial flow has not yet developed . the suppression of the low-@xmath32 @xmath30 mesons in the central in - in collisions hints on the first observation of its in - medium modifications .",
    "the @xmath44-puzzle : the contradiction between the @xmath91 and @xmath94 decay channels studied by the na50 and na49 experiments in pb - pb collisions is not solved despite the consistent results obtained for both channels by ceres and na60 in pb - au and in - in collisions , respectively .",
