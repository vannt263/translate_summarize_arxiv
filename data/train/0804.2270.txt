    "recently there has been considerable interest in understanding the dynamics of systems of active interacting biological agents ( active systems , for short ) , such as flocking birds , schooling fish , swarming bacteria , etc @xcite .",
    "properties of these strongly self - organizing dissipative systems are of fundamental interest to nonequilibrium statistical dynamics @xcite and to potential technological applications @xcite .",
    "common swimming ( motile ) bacteria , such as _ bacillus subtilis _ , _ escherichia coli _ , and many others , are rod - shape microorganisms ( length about 5 @xmath0 , diameter of the order 1 @xmath0 ) , propelled by the input of mechanical energy at the smallest scales by the rotation of helical flagella attached to the cell wall .",
    "suspensions of swimming bacteria ( active suspensions ) are a convenient representative of self - organizing biological systems . at relatively high filling fractions of bacteria ,",
    "they interact mostly through hydrodynamic entrainment induced by their swimming with respect to ambient fluid @xcite , which are instrumental in the establishment of long - range order . at the same time , they are amenable to accurate experimental studies , control , and manipulation @xcite . in the dense regime , the dynamics of active suspensions is dominated by the multiple body interactions and long - range self - organized coherent structures , such as recurring whorls and jets with the spatial scale exceeding the size of individual bacterium by an order of magnitude .",
    "this , however , makes the analysis rather challenging .    in the dilute regime , the hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria ( or passive particles ) are often ignored as the interparticle distance exceeds the range of the flows resulting from the particle motion . therefore , in this case it is possible to isolate the effect of the particle - fluid interactions on the effective properties of active suspensions .",
    "this constitutes a step towards the full understanding and utilization of the novel properties of active suspensions .",
    "the first step was taken in @xcite by einstein , who derived an explicit formula for the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of passive spheres .",
    "this formula shows an increase of the viscosity over that of the ambient fluid alone .",
    "the correction to the effective viscosity is to the first order in the volume fraction of the inclusions .",
    "later , batchelor and greene obtained the second order asymptotic formula , which takes into account pairwise interactions between particles @xcite .",
    "jeffrey calculated the effective viscosity of a suspension of ellipsoidal particles to first order in @xcite . unlike the spherical case , here the value of the viscosity is affected by the distribution of orientations of the inclusions , which is assumed to be uniform .    in this work",
    ", einstein s classical dilute limit result is extended to the case of _ self - propelled _ disk inclusions in a 2d stokesean fluid .",
    "the choice of two - dimensional hydrodynamics is motivated by the tractable nature of calculations involving green s functions in 2d and also by the quasi - two - dimensional thin film geometry of the experiment @xcite .",
    "in particular , the correction to the effective viscosity is explicitly calculated as a function of the orientations of the bacteria s flagella , the intensity of the their force of self - propulsion , and the volume fraction of the suspension . in the case of an absence of self propulsion and , alternatively , the case of a uniform distribution of orientations , the result recovers the 2d version of einstein s result ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the model of the bacterium and the corresponding hydrodynamics are described in section  [ sec - model ] . following batchelor @xcite , the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension",
    "is defined in section  [ sec - model ] , in terms of a suitable background flow and the disturbance flow produced by the inclusion of a bacterium in the background flow . in the case of self - propulsion",
    "the disturbance flow is due both to the passive response of the background flow to the inclusion of a particle as well as the response of the stationary fluid to the particle s self - propulsion . because of the linearity of stokesean hydrodynamics ,",
    "the two components of the disturbance flow can be computed independently using the green s function for the disk .",
    "the disturbance flow @xmath1 due to the locomotion of a single bacterium is calculated in section  [ sec - flow ] .",
    "this flow translates the bacterium .",
    "it is also shown that this disturbance flow decays at infinity .",
    "this result is emphasized since it is a point of well - known deficiency of 2d hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed , while the translation of a ball in 3d produces no flow at infinity , in the well - known stokes paradox , the 3d flow due to an infinite cylinder ( described by the corresponding force monopole ) translating transversely to its axis generates a non - zero flow at infinity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . thus prevents the decoupling of rods , which is needed for the dilute limit , where it is assumed that the flow due to a suspension can be approximated by the sum of solutions due to a single inclusion",
    "however , a self - propelled particle is constrained by the viscous drug force opposing the propulsion force , thus producing a force dipole which decays at infinity , unlike the force monopole in the case of the moving disk .    for the other disturbance flow , @xmath2 , due to the bacterium s passive response to a background flow , care must be taken to ensure that no flow is produced at infinity .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec - ev ] such a flow is selected to ensure the disturbance decays at infinity .",
    "once it has been done , the effective viscosity is calculated as a function of the flagella s orientations relative to the background flow .",
    "the time - dependent nature of the effective viscosity , due to active alignment of the inclusions to the flow , is also discussed .",
    "conclusions are discussed in section  [ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "finally , the details of calculations are discussed in the appendices .",
    "a 2d dilute suspension of bacteria is modeled as a collection of discs of radius @xmath3 , each of which has an associated point force , representing the flagellum , placed at a distance @xmath4 from the disk , as shown in figure  [ orientation ] .",
    "the point force is directed radially outward from the center of the bacterium and has some orientation angle @xmath5 , measured from the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the bacteria are distributed throughout an ambient fluid of viscosity @xmath7 which takes up the entire domain @xmath8 . a single bacterium in an infinite fluid moves with respect to the fluid with constant velocity driven by the point force @xmath9 .",
    "the suspension is assumed to contain sufficiently many bacteria so as to produce appreciable changes in the properties of the equivalent homogenized fluid . at the same time , the size of the bacteria and the propulsion force are assumed to be sufficiently small , so that the disturbance flow produced by bacteria is negligible at inter - bacterial distances and hence can be ignored at the locations of other bacteria .",
    "therefore , in the following calculations , it is sufficient to consider a single bacterium with orientation @xmath5 in an unbounded volume of fluid .",
    "this is analogous to einstein s assumptions for passive suspensions .",
    "this unbounded volume is an idealization of the microscopic volume element surrounding a single one of the particles located within a macroscopic fluid element . because of the decay assumption",
    ", this idealization is permissible for the solution of the stokes equation within that region .",
    "the viscous dissipation in the macroscopic fluid element is then the sum of the dissipations in all of the subordinate microscopic volumes , containing a collection of particles having some prescribed distribution of orientations .",
    "analogous to the method of batchelor in @xcite , the effective viscosity @xmath10 of a suspension in an ambient fluid of viscosity @xmath7 is defined as the viscosity of an equivalent fluid with no inclusions that produces the same energy dissipation in each macroscopic volume element .    for a suspension of passive particles ,",
    "the existence of an equivalent newtonian fluid with the scalar effective viscosity @xmath10 is a classical result of homogenization theory ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the analysis for active particles is more subtle and has not been carried out in a rigorous mathematical context .",
    "the assumption is made that the effective viscosity can be defined in the same way for active particles .",
    "nevertheless , the technique is presented somewhat cryptically in the literature . to clarify the main points ,",
    "the conceptual side of the calculation is presented here in some detail ; the technical details can be found in [ app - def_ev ] ( also see @xcite for the derivation in the case of passive particles ) .    .",
    "]    since the effective viscosity is defined in terms of energy dissipation , a background flow ( which describes the flow throughout the homogenized fluid and on the boundary of the suspension ) is chosen so that it has a non - zero rate of energy dissipation ( i.e. , requiring a non - zero strain rate ) . choosing @xmath8 to represent the microscopic volume with coordinates @xmath11 the velocity components of the background flow are @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is constant and symmetric strain rate tensor but otherwise left to be specified later .",
    "adding a single self - propelled disk inclusion @xmath14 somewhere in the plane produces the disturbance flow @xmath15 .",
    "provided that @xmath16 is selected properly , @xmath15 vanishes at infinity , decoupling the bacteria , as required of the dilute limit .",
    "the disturbance flow can be computed explicitly and it is done below .",
    "the total flow of the suspension is @xmath17 and in principle it should be possible now to compare the dissipation rates of @xmath16 and @xmath18 by integrating over @xmath8 and @xmath19 respectively .    as shown in @xcite , the integration over the unbounded volume @xmath8 leads to technical difficulties .",
    "this motivates the more efficient method of comparing the dissipation rates within a bounded domain @xmath20 which contains sufficiently many bacteria .",
    "figure  [ fig - omega ] shows such a domain encompassing two bacteria",
    ". inside @xmath20 are the regions representing the bodies of the bacteria , @xmath21 and , for each , an @xmath22-disk @xmath23 around the corresponding point force .",
    "the disturbance flow in the domain @xmath24 is required to vanish at the outer boundary @xmath25 .    [ fig - omega ]   for which the modified dissipation rate is computed ; includes the complement of two @xmath3-disks ( bacteria ) and @xmath22-disks ( neighborhoods of point forces).,title=\"fig : \" ]    this models a finite container with the background flow applied at the boundary and simplifies the computation of the dissipation rate integrals by replacing a volume integral with an integral over the boundaries of the bacteria .",
    "calculating the disturbance flows @xmath26 , however , involves solving a boundary value problem in the two - dimensional domain @xmath24 . to avoid this",
    ", the total dissipation rate in this domain can be equivalently calculated as the integral of the work of forces at the boundary @xmath27 . by requiring that @xmath28 vanish at @xmath29 , the flow of the homogenized fluid and total flow of the suspension",
    "agree on the boundary @xmath30 , @xmath31 , but the corresponding values of the stress tensors @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not necessarily the same .",
    "now , the density of work at the boundary is @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the homogenized and total suspension flows respectively .",
    "the effective viscosity is defined by integrating these quantities over @xmath30 and setting them equal : @xmath36 using the stokes equation @xmath37 and repeatedly applying the divergence theorem ( see appendix [ app - def_ev ] ) , the integrals of these densities over @xmath27 can be reduced to integrals over the boundary of the bacterial domain only : @xmath38 .",
    "these integrals are independent of @xmath27 and upon passing to the limit @xmath39 they are expressed in terms of the disturbance flow @xmath15 vanishing at infinity .",
    "the effective viscosity is then determined from the expression resulting from summing over all inclusions : @xmath40 applying the dilute assumption , the solution to ( [ stokesfull ] ) is replaced by a superposition of solutions for the flow due to a single bacterium , derived in the next section .",
    "thus , for aligned bacteria , the above integral can be replaced with one over the boundary of one bacterium in @xmath8 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the volume fraction occupied by bacteria .",
    "let @xmath43 be the exterior of the unit disk in @xmath8 and @xmath44 be the dirac delta evaluated at @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the location of the point force . in the low reynolds number limit , the flow due to the bacterium obeys the stokes equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the force strength and @xmath49 .",
    "for simplicity of calculations , set @xmath50 and @xmath51 . note that here , @xmath52 is set to @xmath53 on @xmath30 .",
    "this is the reference frame in which the bacterium is moving  for the purpose of finding the total flow of the suspension , the reference frame in which the fluid is at rest at infinity must be used . by writing @xmath16 as the curl of a stream function @xmath54 and taking the divergence of ( [ stokes ] ) , this reduces to the inhomogeneous biharmonic equation @xmath55    the green s function @xmath56 for the domain @xmath43 with these boundary conditions is known and yields the solution @xmath57 explicitly , in polar coordinates , @xmath58 . \\nonumber \\ ] ]        it is easy to see that @xmath59 as @xmath60 . subtracting this flow ( moving to the reference frame where the water is at rest at @xmath61 ) and rescaling to a disk of radius @xmath3 ,",
    "is shown in figure [ velocity ] and is given asymptotically by @xmath62    now , by taking the divergence of ( [ stokes ] ) , one obtains @xmath63 the solution to ( [ pressurepde ] ) is found using complex function theory ( see appendix [ app - pressure ] ) , and is the real part of the complex function @xmath64",
    "in order to calculate the effective viscosity , it remains to perform the integration in ( [ evintegral ] ) .",
    "the effective viscosity is independent of the background flow , so one is free to choose the flow which simplifies the necessary calculations . in ( [ evintegral ] ) ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath65 are the solutions to @xmath66 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath67 note that , as mentioned in section [ sec - flow ] , one is not free to choose the value of the constant that @xmath16 takes on @xmath30 .    the formula for the effective viscosity does not depend on the choice of background flow ( i.e. , the choice of the strain rate tensor @xmath13 in ( [ bgflow - bcs ] ) ) . however , the choice of this flow is not completely arbitrary .",
    "first , since the effective viscosity is defined in terms of energy dissipation , a non - zero rate of strain is required so that there is energy being dissipated due to viscosity .",
    "second , the background flow is chosen so that it does not rotate bacteria , which allows for the computation of the effective viscosity for a fixed ( time - independent ) distribution of orientations of bacteria ( see figure [ orientation ] ) .",
    "third , upon placing a disk ( i.e. , bacterium ) in the flow , it is necessary that the disturbance flow @xmath68 as @xmath60 . if this were not the case , the dilute assumption that this flow is negligible at the locations of other bacteria would be violated . in 2d",
    ", this is only possible for a background flow that satisfies the conditions for existence of such a decaying flow derived in @xcite .",
    "the background flow is chosen to be the simplest flow that matches these criteria  the sum of two perpendicular shearing flows , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the amplitude of the strain rate .",
    "the disturbance flow due to the presence of a bacterium will be @xmath71 with the pressure given by @xmath72 where , using notation , @xmath73 as a polar vector and @xmath74 , rotated to allow for an arbitrary orientation of a bacterium in the background flow .    for a suspension of bacteria that are not fully aligned",
    ", the effective viscosity can be written in terms of the function @xmath75 which gives the probability density of orientations of the bacteria @xmath76 , which are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables . in this case , ( [ evintegral ] ) becomes @xmath77 where @xmath42 is the volume fraction occupied by bacteria . performing the integration over @xmath78 ,",
    "one obtains the following formula for the effective viscosity : @xmath79 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the two - dimensional volume fraction .",
    "note that for isotropically oriented bacteria ( @xmath80 ) , the angular term goes to zero and the effective viscosity reduces to the result in @xcite for the effective viscosity of a two - dimensional dilute suspension of disks , @xmath81 nevertheless , in experiments a reduction in viscosity is anticipated @xcite . in reality , bacteria are not spherical .",
    "an interaction with the background flow thus produces a torque on the bacteria which will tend to align them in particular preferred directions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for a fully aligned suspension of bacteria , one obtains , from ( [ evformula ] ) , @xmath82.\\ ] ] for the background flow ( [ bgflow ] ) , the corresponding preferred directions are @xmath83 . thus , after aligning , @xmath84.\\ ] ] this formula can be used to explain the experimental data on the reduction of viscosity in bacterial suspensions observed in @xcite .",
    "here a rather puzzling result has been obtained : the effective viscosity of active bacterial suspension _ may decrease _ with the increase in volume fraction of particles .",
    "moreover , the viscosity may even become formally negative ( when the flagella add more energy than is being dissipated ) if the volume fraction @xmath42 and the magnitude of the propulsion force @xmath85 exceed critical values .",
    "manifestations of negative viscosity have been observed in experiments @xcite via large - scale instability and the formation of non - decaying whorls and jets of collective locomotion ( see also simulations @xcite for dense suspensions ) .",
    "the reduction of effective viscosity can be interpreted as a result of transformation by swimming bacteria of chemical energy of the surrounding nutrient medium into mechanical energy of fluid motion , and thus replacing energy loss due to viscous dissipation .",
    "it is also notable that the coefficient @xmath86 , which characterizes the strength of the background flow , shows up in the formula for effective viscosity ( unlike in a newtonian fluid ) .",
    "thus , the additional term due to self - propulsion is inherently non - newtonian .",
    "since @xmath86 appears in the denominator , there is a blow up in the effective viscosity as @xmath87 .",
    "nevertheless , this is to be expected , as the viscosity is , roughly , the ratio of stress of the entire flow to rate of strain of the background flow  in the case of a bacterial suspension , as the rate of strain of the background flow goes to zero , the stress does not , since the bacteria will continue swimming .",
    "we also comment that the limit of vanishing background flow @xmath88 is not trivial .",
    "as mentioned above , the reduction of viscosity occurs only when the bacteria become aligned in a certain direction determined by the principal axis of the strain - rate tensor .",
    "however , when @xmath87 , the bacteria no longer have a tendency to align ( also , a preexisting aligned state would be destroyed by fluctuations , e.g. due to random tumbling of bacteria ) and hence the third term in eq .",
    "( [ evformula ] ) does not blow up .",
    "thus , in the limit of @xmath88 , the steady state is in fact the isotropically oriented suspensions @xmath89 , which recovers the classical result for disks eq .",
    "( [ eq : disks ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the effective viscosity for small strain rates is determined by the interplay between the response of the bacterium , through its orientation , to the shear strain and random fluctuations , one needs to solve self - consistently the equation for the orientation distribution function @xmath90 ) in the presence of non - zero strain rate .",
    "this isotropic orientation can also explain the results of recent simulations @xcite in which no reduction of the effective viscosity due to swimming bacteria ( modeled by spherically symmetric particles ) was detected : the reduction of viscosity requires particle reorientation by shear flow .",
    "however , the orientation of spherical particles is not affected by shear flow . in contrast",
    ", the effect is expected for elongated particles ( ellipsoids or cylinders with large aspect ratios ( of the order of 1:5 for swimming bacteria ) .    obviously , more dedicated controlled experiments with bacterial suspensions and further generalizations of the obtained result to more general flow geometries , such as three - dimensional films and slabs , are keenly needed . the puzzling phenomenon of reduced viscosity in bacteria - laden fluids may find rather unexpected technological applications in bio - medical research and chemical technology , such as microscopic bacterial mixers and chemical reactors @xcite .    *",

    "the right hand side of ( [ defev ] ) is the additional rate of dissipation due to the suspension .",
    "employing the divergence theorem yet again , this integral is transformed into an integral over the surfaces of the particles , producing @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the volume occupied by a single bacterium , @xmath105 is a ball of radius @xmath106 around its corresponding point force , and the summation is taken over all bacteria inside @xmath43 .",
    "now , the fluid in @xmath43 obeys the inhomogeneous stokes equation @xmath107 where the subscript @xmath108 has been added to all quantities that can vary among the bacteria . in particular , @xmath109 is its velocity of the @xmath108th bacterium , @xmath110 is the location of its point force , and @xmath111 indicates the strength and orientation of each point force .",
    "thus , @xmath112 in @xmath113 .",
    "additionally , @xmath114 since the surface integral over @xmath30 vanishes . applying these observations to ( [ defev ] ) produces @xmath115 .",
    "recall that the velocity field @xmath16 solves the stokes equation , @xmath116    for simplicity , it is assumed that @xmath117 and @xmath118 . since @xmath119 , the velocity can be expressed as the ( 2d ) curl of a scalar stream function @xmath120 .",

    "<S> suspensions of self - propelled particles are studied in the framework of two - dimensional ( 2d ) stokesean hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a formula is obtained for the effective viscosity of such suspensions in the limit of small concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> this formula includes the two terms that are found in the 2d version of einstein s classical result for passive suspensions . to this , the main result of the paper is added , an additional term due to self - propulsion which depends on the physical and geometric properties of the active suspension . </S>",
    "<S> this term explains the experimental observation of a decrease in effective viscosity in active suspensions . </S>"
