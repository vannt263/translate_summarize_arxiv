    "apart from the scaling , model parameters ( the initial density power - law , @xmath42 , and preshock temperature ) are constrained by observations , leaving only the mach number of the shock free in the fit .",
    "the model has a number of shortcomings ( the actual outburst is aspherical , does not inject energy in a single explosion and the initial gas density is not a power law , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that it can only be expected to match the data over a limited range of radius behind the shock . nevertheless , the fit provides a stringent test that this feature is due to a shock propagating into the cluster .",

    "density error bars are 90% confidence ranges .",
    "the continuous line shows the density profile for the best fitting model . ]    in order to determine physical properties of the outburst from the model , we must determine the density and temperature of the unshocked gas .",
    "however , outside the shock from @xmath20 to @xmath43 , in the sectors of the surface brightness profile , there are only @xmath44 photons in the 0.6  7.5 kev band .",
    "we have therefore used a single spectrum extracted from this region to determine the temperature and normalize the density of the unshocked gas .",
    "using an absorbed mekal model , with @xmath45 , redshift @xmath8 and the abundance set to 0.5 , gives a temperature of @xmath46 kev ( 90% ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the spectrum is not significantly affected by the particle background . assuming that the gas is spherically symmetric and its density @xmath47 from the shock to infinity , the normalization of the spectral fit gives an electron density of @xmath48 at a radius of 276 kpc ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "using these parameters , the radius of the shock is 158 kpc , the time since the outburst is @xmath50 y and the total energy of the outburst is @xmath51 erg .",
    "this energy is similar to the lobe enthalpy @xcite , as expected if the lobes drive the shock .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the age of the outburst ( @xmath52 ) is due to the uncertainty in the preshock temperature .",
    "the shortcomings of the model do give rise to systematic uncertainty in the shock energy , but this is unlikely to be more than a factor @xmath53 @xcite .    in the temperature range 1.6 ",
    "10 kev , the _ chandra _  count rate in the band 0.6 - 7.5 kev is very insensitive to gas temperature , varying @xmath54 about its mean over the whole range of temperature , for a fixed emission measure .",
    "this enables us to deproject the gas density with reasonable accuracy , despite poor knowledge of the gas temperature ( doubling the abundance to 1.0 would reduce the electron density by @xmath55 ) .",
    "a deprojection was done , using the method of @xcite , with the gas temperature fixed at 4 kev and other parameters as above .",
    "the resulting electron density profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep ] , together with the electron density profile obtained from the mach 1.65 shock model .",
    "the results agree well with the model , clearly showing the density jump at the shock .",
    "the failure of the model for @xmath56 kpc is a numerical artifact , but other shortcomings are expected to make the model inaccurate at small radii .    in the models ,",
    "adiabatic expansion limits the size of the region where the temperature of the shocked gas exceeds that of the unshocked gas .",
    "nevertheless , the strength of the shock in hercules a makes it a good candidate for detecting the temperature rise due to the shock . for the mach 1.65 model , after projection onto the sky , the emission measure weighted temperature exceeds the preshock temperature by at least 20% for 110 kpc @xmath57 150 kpc . with other fit parameters as above , a spectrum extracted from this region (",
    "@xmath58 0.6  7.5 kev source counts ) gives a temperature of @xmath59 kev ( 90% ) , in reasonable agreement with the model .",
    "the mean power of the outburst in hercules a , @xmath60 , is two orders of magnitude larger than the total power radiated from the region where the cooling time is shorter than @xmath61 y. hercules a joins a small collection of cooling flow clusters known to have large - scale shocks driven by an outburst from an agn at the cluster center @xcite .",
    "three of these systems , hydra a , ms0735.6 + 7421 and hercules a , have outburst energies of @xmath62 erg .",
    "the outburst in hercules a currently has the strongest shock and its total energy is the second largest known ( ms0735.6 + 7421 is twice as energetic , * ? ? ?",
    "along with the other systems , it has important implications for the energetics of cooling flows , the preheating of clusters , the interaction of radio sources with the icm and the growth of nuclear black holes @xcite .",
    "if the outburst is powered by accretion onto a black hole , then the outburst energy is @xmath63 , where the mass @xmath64 was accreted to fuel the outburst and @xmath65 is the efficiency of jet energy production by the black hole .",
    "unless @xmath66 , the mass swallowed by the black hole exceeds @xmath67 to fuel this outburst . if this mass was swallowed in a time comparable to the age of the outburst , @xmath68 y , the mass increase is hard to reconcile with a tight correlation between bulge properties and black hole mass @xcite , unless the black hole is very massive indeed .    in our mach 1.65 model ,",
    "the shock inverts the entropy profile of gas inside 58 kpc ( @xmath69 ) , creating a buoyant bubble at the cluster center that would then rise .",
    "a large bubble can rise at a significant fraction of the sound speed @xcite , but always more slowly than the shock front .",
    "although the shock model is not expected to match reality closely , the cavities in hercules a are comparable in size to the entropy inversion of the model , suggesting that this is how they were formed .",
    "this would explain the lack of radio emission from the cavities .",
    "analysis of a _ chandra _",
    "x - ray image of the hercules a cluster shows that it has cavities and a shock front associated with the powerful radio source .",
    "unusually , the cavities show no clear connection to the radio source .",
    "the shock front is elongated in the direction of the radio lobes and appears to be its cocoon shock .",
    "fitting a simple hydrodynamic model to the surface brightness profile gives a mach number for the shock of @xmath70 .",
    "the age of the outburst that drove the shock is @xmath71 y and its total energy is @xmath72 erg .",
    "the deprojected density profile is consistent with the shock model and , in particular , with the density jump at the shock . within the limits of the spectroscopic data ,",
    "the temperature jump is also consistent with the shock model .",
    "the shock outburst is highly significant for the energetics of any cooling flow in hercules a and for the cluster as a whole .",
