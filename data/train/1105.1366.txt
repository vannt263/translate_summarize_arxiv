    "when a piece of thin sheet like paper crumples , it develops a network of two types of sharp structures : straight stretching ridges and pointlike vertices . since thin sheets and membranes are very common in both natural and man - made structures at almost all length scales , crumpling has applications in a broad range of systems , such as graphene sheets @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , virus capsids @xcite , pollen grains @xcite , polymerized membranes @xcite , and leaves @xcite .",
    "the pointlike vertex singularity has mostly been studied via the simple realization known as the developable cone or d - cone , shown in figure [ dcone](a ) .",
    "a d - cone is the shape created by pushing the center of a thin sheet into a circular container of radius @xmath0 by a distance @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "d - cones , stretching ridges , and crumpling in general have been studied extensively @xcite . in certain cases",
    "it is possible to set bounds on the energy of singular structures @xcite , but to our knowledge such bounds have not been established for d - cones . furthermore , while the scaling properties of stretching ridges have been determined analytically and numerically @xcite , several phenomena in d - cones are still beyond our understanding @xcite . one mysterious behavior of d - cones is the reported vanishing of mean curvature at the rim region where a d - cone is supported @xcite .",
    "the deformation of a d - cone can be characterized by the deflection @xmath7 and its young s modulus is denoted by @xmath6 . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined as radial and angular components in the material coordinate system . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the radial and azimuthal curvature respectively . in principle",
    "the shape of a d - cone is governed by the fppl - von krmn equations@xcite , whose analytical solution is known only in a few special cases @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a d - cone is not one of these cases .",
    "however , it is energetically much cheaper for thin sheets to bend than to stretch , so a d - cone is asymptotically unstretched , and thence developable , except in the core region where it is pushed . assuming that a d - cone is unstretched almost everywhere , cerda and mahadevan @xcite described the deformation in terms of the classical elastica of euler @xcite and obtained the shape of the d - cone by minimizing the bending energy .",
    "numerical study @xcite has confirmed their finding .",

    "this bending deformation can be captured either by the three dihedral angles @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 between @xmath15 and its three neighbors or by the curvature tensor , which is assumed constant across the four triangles.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a variable lattice for a d - cone is created in two stages @xcite .",
    "first a uniform triangular lattice of spacing @xmath16 is used to span the desired area .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath16 is the distance between adjacent lattice points .",
    "then this lattice is mapped to the desired nonuniform lattice e.g. figure [ dcone](b ) .",
    "let the point density of the initial uniform lattice be @xmath17 . for our purposes we may choose a mapping with radial symmetry .",
    "for a point @xmath18 in the uniform lattice , we transform @xmath8 so its new position in the variable lattice is @xmath19 .",
    "then the local point density in the variable lattice is @xmath20 . in practice , we choose @xmath21 to be a function form of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g_{i}(r , r_i , w_i , s_i)}{\\partial r}=\\frac{s_i}{(r - r_i)^2+w_i^2 } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and the index @xmath24 labels the regions where local point density needs adjustment . in figure [ dcone](b ) there are four such regions : the center region , the rim region , the region between the center and the rim , and the outer region . in the center region and the rim region",
    "the point densities are increased while in the two other larger regions the point densities are reduced .",
    "the overall average point density remains close to that of the uniform lattice before the density adjustment .",
    "as shown in figure [ mapping_function ] , the graph of @xmath25 is a simple u - shaped curve centered around @xmath26 , and we can control its width through @xmath27 and depth through @xmath28 .     vs. @xmath8",
    "when @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the resulting nonuniform lattice defines the initial undeformed state of figure [ strain ] for each triangle in the nonuniform lattice .",
    "thus the lattice positions defined by this map constitute the state of zero stretching energy . by construction , these positions lie in a plane , so that each triangle also has zero curvature energy as defined by figure [ bend_fig ] .",
    "creating the nonuniform lattice for a c - cone requires two additional steps . to simulate a c - cone with opening angle equal to @xmath32",
    ", we make a cut along the radial line @xmath33 , and map every lattice point through the transformation @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the last step is to join the two free boundary lines .",
    "that is , we identify each point on the free radial boundary line with its counterpart on the other free boundary line , so that the two lattice positions are constrained to occupy the same spatial position in the simulation .    the constraining container rim and the pushing force are simulated in almost the same way as previously used in ref .",
    "the rim is in the @xmath36 plane and its shape is determined by the equation @xmath37 , where @xmath0 is the radius of the container .",
    "we introduce an external potential to implement the geometric rim constraint @xmath38 for all points in the sheet .",
    "to implement such a constraint for a discrete lattice we must assure that every lattice point remains a distance of order @xmath16 from the rim line . for numerical tractability",
    "we assure this by adding an external potential felt by all lattice points that maintain the required separation while having negligible effect on more distant points .",
    "we find empirically that a short range @xmath39 potential is adequate .",
    "more specifically , we implement the repulsive normal force from the rim by introducing a potential of the form @xmath40 ^ 4 \\ , , \\nonumber\\]]where @xmath41 is a constant , @xmath42 is the coordinate of the @xmath43th lattice point , and the summation is over the whole lattice .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is chosen so that the shortest distance between the lattice points and the rim is approximately the local lattice spacing in the radial direction .",
    "the potential due to the central pushing force is @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the coordinate of the lattice point in the center , @xmath5 is effectively the magnitude of the pushing force , and the function @xmath46 is given by @xmath47^{-1 } \\ , , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a constant of order @xmath49 .",
    "this @xmath46 is introduced to make sure that when the sheet is being pushed the lattice point in the center does not stray away from the axis of the cylindrical container , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the total energy of the system is the sum of the total elastic energy in the sheet and the potential energies due to the rim and the applied pushing force .",
    "the conjugate gradient algorithm@xcite is used to minimize the total energy as a function of the coordinates of all lattice points to get the final shape of the sheet @xcite . to verify that the energy of the final configuration is at a global minimum , we can move each lattice point away from its equilibrium position by a random amount in a random direction and see if the energy minimization process will bring the system back to its original state ; the magnitudes of the random displacements introduced are usually much less than the local lattice spacing .",
    "we can also check how sensitive the final configuration is to the starting configuration .",
    "a high sensitivity generally signals the thickness of the sheet is too small for the current lattice to simulate and the results are likely unreliable .",
    "this model faithfully represents continuum sheets provided that the radii of curvature are everywhere much larger than the local lattice spacing .",
    "this limitation restricts the values of deflection @xmath51 to be less than or equal to @xmath52 in our simulations .",
    "@xcite reports further details about this simulation technique .",
    "the simulation program using the nonuniform lattice has been validated to show uniform elastic behavior for states of planar stress and for cylinders .",
    "it has been validated against uniform lattices for d - cones of thickness @xmath2 that can be simulated by both methods .",
    "@xcite also provides further simulated sheets , as well as our relaxation protocol and timing information .",
    "our computer program is sequential and the bottleneck of the simulation is the cpu speed .",
    "a typical d - cone or c - cone is simulated with @xmath53 lattice points , and it usually takes more than one month to finish the energy minimization process on a @xmath54 @xmath55 intel core @xmath56 processor .",
    "each processor usually runs only one instance of the program at a time , but we have up to @xmath57 processors to run multiple instances with different parameters simultaneously .",
    "once the final configuration of a d - cone is obtained , the curvature tensor in each triangle can be determined using the procedure stated earlier .",
    "we then solve the characteristic equation of each curvature tensor to get the principal curvatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 . to find the radial profile of @xmath10 , we pick a circular sector with angle @xmath58 and for each triangle within this sector , its @xmath10",
    "is associated with the radial coordinate of its center . as shown later",
    ", @xmath10 reaches its maximum at the rim where the interaction between the sheet and the container is the strongest . within each sector",
    "we average the four largest values of @xmath10 near the peak as the rim value of @xmath10 .",
    "the four corresponding @xmath11 are averaged to get the rim value of @xmath11 .",
    "the rim curvatures depend on the angular separation between the center line of the circular sector and that of the buckled region .",
    "the angular separation is @xmath59 for the rim profiles of @xmath10 and rim values of @xmath60 reported in subsequent sections .",
    "the estimated percentage uncertainty of the reported rim values of @xmath60 due to this angular dependence is about @xmath61 for the whole range of thickness considered .",
    "a better approach is to average the rim @xmath10 and @xmath11 across multiple sectors , but this will have no noticeable impact on our results .",
    "our tests also show that different initial configurations will cause @xmath60 at the rim to change by less than @xmath62 for the range of thickness considered here .",
    "if we assume these two sources of uncertainties are independent , the total percentage uncertainty for the reported rim values of @xmath60 should be about @xmath63 .",
    "the results for c - cones are determined in the same way and have the same level of uncertainties as in the d - cone data .",
    "figure [ ratio_dcone_fig ] shows @xmath60 at the rim of d - cones versus relative thickness @xmath64 for two different values of @xmath51 .",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , @xmath0 and young s modulus @xmath6 are assumed to be constant . for both @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", @xmath60 goes below 1 as @xmath64 is sufficiently thin , and it does not show any sign of leveling off as it reaches as low as 0.76 in the thinnest sheets simulated . more strikingly , for each fixed @xmath51 , @xmath60 scales as @xmath67 .",
    "this clearly contradicts the previous observation of vanishing mean curvature which requires @xmath60 to stay at 1 when the sheet gets very thin . to resolve this contradiction , we need a better understanding of how @xmath60 at the rim responds to changes in @xmath68 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , in d - cones there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath68 and @xmath5 for a fixed @xmath51 . to gain more flexibility and to explore the generality of this feature , we study d - cone s close relative , the c - cone .     and @xmath66 .",
    "it clearly shows that the ratio is less than one for very thin sheets and the ratio keeps decreasing as the sheet gets thinner .",
    "the slopes of the fitted lines are 0.36 and 0.34 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in c - cones , for a fixed @xmath65 , while @xmath68 and @xmath5 are changed independently we find that @xmath60 at the rim scales as @xmath4 , as shown in figure [ crr_over_ctt_ratio_ccone_dcone ] .",
    "this scaling law is justified in section iv . in d - cones , even though @xmath68 and @xmath5 are interdependent , the same scaling law also holds .",
    "moreover , figure [ crr_vs_dcone_radial ] demonstrates that for the same set of @xmath68 , @xmath5 , and @xmath51 the radial profile of normalized @xmath10 near the rim is the same in the d - cone as in the c - cone .",
    "these two findings together suggest very strongly that the behavior of @xmath10 in the rim region of a d - cone is identical to that in a c - cone , and should be explained by the same mechanism .     at the rim as a function of @xmath4 for both c - cones and d - cones . @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath5 are changed independently in the c - cone data . for a specific @xmath68 ,",
    "if we denote @xmath69 as the center force needed in the d - cone to give the @xmath51 of the c - cone , namely 0.1 , the pushing forces used in the corresponding c - cone simulations may vary from @xmath70 to @xmath71.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     in both a c - cone and a d - cone . the c - cone and the d - cone",

    "each profile is normalized by dividing the vertical scale by its corresponding peak value .",
    "there is no normalization for the horizontal scale .",
    "as stated in section ii , for the d - cone the angular separation between the buckled region and the radial sector used to generate the radial profile is @xmath59 .",

    "figure [ d_vs_f_h_cd_cone ] shows that @xmath72 has a linear response to @xmath5 and scales as @xmath74 . from figure [ b_vs_h_r_cd_cone ] , we can see that @xmath73 is independent of @xmath5 and scales as @xmath75{hr } $ ] .",
    "it s worth noting that for the same @xmath68 and within numerical accuracy @xmath73 is exactly the same in a d - cone as in a c - cone .",
    "it scales in the same way as the width of a pogorelov ring ridge formed by pushing a convex thin shell with a large inward concentrated normal force @xcite .",
    "our scaling arguments in the next section will closely follow how the scaling properties of the pogorelov ring ridge are derived .     of the local deformation near the rim as a function of @xmath74 .",
    "the constant container radius @xmath0 is set to be the unit length . in the c - cone data @xmath68 and @xmath5 are changed independently as in figure [ crr_over_ctt_ratio_ccone_dcone ] .",

    "the energy contribution of the local deformation includes both bending and stretching energy .",
    "let us first find how each of them scales with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    to evaluate the bending energy component , we start with the principal curvatures .",
    "we denote quantities unperturbed by the rim force by an overbar , e.g. , @xmath77 .",
    "we denote changes induced by the the rim force by a @xmath78 , e.g. , @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 be the deviation of the tangent vector away from the original direction along a meridian as shown in figure [ ccone_shape](b ) .",
    "in the deformed region @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we also have @xmath83 , and radius of the azimuthal curvature @xmath84 . due to the local deformation , @xmath85 , so @xmath86 , or @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 as argued below , @xmath89 is much less than @xmath90 and can be safely ignored .",
    "locally there is a contribution to the @xmath91 part of the bending energy of equation [ bend_density ] .",
    "the change in this energy induced by the rim force is of order @xmath92 .",
    "however , this @xmath91 energy must integrate to zero because of the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "thus the bending energy @xmath93 due to the local deformation near the rim ( over an area @xmath94 ) is : @xmath95    for the stretching component , @xmath96 and @xmath97 is negligible here .",
    "increases by @xmath98{d^2+b^2}-b \\sim d^2/b $ ] , but the stretching due to this elongation is spread over a distance much larger than @xmath73 .",
    "this can be shown through the following exercise .",
    "for the cone shown in figure [ ccone_shape](a ) , let us remove the top part that is above the rim , fix the outer edge , and pull the top edge of the remaining cone along the meridian away from the outer edge by a distance of @xmath99 .",

    "plugging this back into equations [ bend_energy_rim ] and [ stretch_energy_rim ] , the total elastic energy is @xmath108 taking the derivative of the total elastic energy with respect to @xmath72 and equating the result to the pushing force @xmath5 , we find @xmath109 .",
    "thus @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "all the scaling relations obtained here agree with the numerical results presented in the previous section .",
    "the deformation of shells of revolution under symmetrical loading is a classical problem @xcite .",
    "the governing fppl - von krmn equations@xcite are 4th order nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified by treating the limiting regime of weak loading , so that the equations can be linearized in the deformation . from the linearized solution",
    ", we may then verify that for loading forces of interest , the linearized treatment is completely valid for asymptotically thin sheets .",
    "for a c - cone , assuming that the supporting container s rim is infinitely hard ( i.e. the range of the normal force from the rim is close to zero ) , @xmath80 satisfies the following differential equations as shown in appendix b : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is half of the underlying cone s opening angle , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "these equations have closed form solutions in terms of bessel functions . for @xmath116 ,",

    "the @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 functions are known as the thomson or kelvin functions @xcite .",
    "evidently @xmath80 goes to zero for large @xmath8 .",
    "however , @xmath121 and @xmath120 diverges there , and are linearly independent .",
    "thus their coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 must vanish . the solution for the @xmath126 has an extra term : @xmath127+b_6[ber(\\zeta)-\\frac{2}{\\zeta}bei'(\\zeta ) ] \\\\ & + b_7[kei(\\zeta)+\\frac{2}{\\zeta}ker'(\\zeta)]+b_8[ker(\\zeta)-\\frac{2}{\\zeta}kei'(\\zeta ) ] \\\\ & -a_2/r \\end{split}\\quad.\\ ] ] even though @xmath128 and @xmath129 are divergent at @xmath130 , the @xmath123 and @xmath122 terms are needed to balance the @xmath131 term that also diverges at the apex .",
    "however , @xmath128 and @xmath132 decreases almost exponentially as @xmath119 increases , so these two terms are negligible near the rim . for our purpose of getting the radial profile of @xmath10 near the rim , the term @xmath133 can also be ignored because it changes in length scale @xmath134 , which is much larger than the width of the rim region .",
    "the contribution of this term to @xmath10 at the rim is vanishingly small compared with the @xmath10 we got from numerical simulations and scaling arguments : @xmath135_{r = r\\csc(\\theta_0 ) } \\sim \\frac{a_2}{r^2}\\frac{yr^3}{(r / h)^{5/2}f } \\sim ( \\frac{h}{r})^{3/2}.\\ ] ]    we conclude from the preceding reasoning that it is sufficient to specify @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 for the inner and outer regions . to determine these four coefficients",
    ", we may use the four matching conditions applicable at the forcing point @xmath140 : @xmath80 is continuous and equal to zero , the curvature @xmath141 is also continuous , and there is a jump for @xmath142 which equals @xmath143 . the last condition is due to the assumption that the rim of the supporting container is infinitely hard . any localized force on an elastic sheet",
    "produces a discontinuity of curvature derivative of this type @xcite .",
    "finally , we can compare the radial profile of @xmath10 from analytical solution with that from numerical simulation . the overall excellent agreement between them , as shown in figure [ ccone_vs_theory ] , gives convincing evidence that our numerical results are valid .",
    "it should be stressed that there is no normalization in either axis .",
    "the @xmath144 difference between the peak values are primarily due to three factors .",
    "first , as noted in section ii the percentage uncertainty of the rim curvatures from simulation is about @xmath63 .",
    "second , the analytical solution assumes an infinitely sharp container edge , but the force range of the normal force used in the simulation is close to @xmath145 of the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the peak for this specific c - cone .",
    "third , the local lattice spacing in the radial direction is also about @xmath145 of the fwhm .",
    "the last two factors cause the simulated curve to have a rounded peak .",
    "the effect of the finite thickness of the sheet is negligible here since the thickness is less than a tenth of the normal force range .",
    "finite size of the simulation can also influence the curvature profile .",
    "in addition to the stronger peak , the analytical solution shown in figure [ ccone_vs_theory ] has a @xmath61 stronger dip on either side .",
    "we believe this is due to the local compensation of gaussian curvature @xcite , which requires the integral under the curve to be zero .",
    "so if the analytical solution has extra area under the peak , it must have extra negative area at the dips .    over the full range of the c - cone sheet thickness covered in our simulation ,",
    "the peak values of the @xmath10 at the rim from simulation is lower than that given by the analytical solutions by between @xmath61 and @xmath144 .",
    "we should expect a similar level of discrepancy between the simulation and analytical solutions for the d - cone .",
    "thus the lowest @xmath146 value achieved for d - cones in our simulations may increase from @xmath147 to a value as high as @xmath148 , which is much closer to @xmath149 , but this level of discrepancy should have no material impact on the scaling relationship between @xmath146 , @xmath68 , and @xmath5 , which is the much stronger evidence that @xmath146 at the rim will drop below one and keep decreasing as the thickness of the sheet approaches zero .     in a c - cone from both numerical simulations and analytical solutions .",
    "@xmath10 is in units of @xmath150 .",

    "in this paper we have shown numerically that contrary to previous claims , the mean curvature at the rim in a d - cone does not vanish as the thickness of the sheet goes to zero .",
    "this vanishing requires that @xmath60 goes to @xmath149 .",
    "however , in the range we studied , @xmath60 at the rim appears to vary as @xmath67 . more generally , in both c - cones and d - cones , @xmath152 .",
    "these identical scaling laws and the similarity of the radial profiles of @xmath10 in d - cones and c - cones suggest that the core region of a d - cone has no influence on how the rim region reacts to the normal rim force pressure .",
