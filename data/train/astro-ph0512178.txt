    "microquasars in our galaxy display large flux variability in x - ray band .",
    "such luminosity variations are thought to reflect violent phenomena in accretion disks around black holes .",
    "the dwarf - nova type disk - instability is responsible for the luminosity changes on the time - scale of months ( e.g. , mineshige & wheeler 1989 ; for a review kato et al .",
    "1998 ,  5 ) .",
    "in contrast , the mechanism causing the short - term variability ( @xmath6 s ) is not well understood yet .",
    "one of the plausible mechanisms for it is thermal and secular instability which arises when the radiation pressure becomes dominant over gas pressure ( e.g. , lightman & eardley 1974 ; shibazaki & hshi 1975 ; pringle 1976 ; shakura & sunyaev 1976 ) .",
    "s - shaped sequence on the @xmath7 ( mass accretion rate vs. surface density ) plane was completed by the finding of a slim - disk branch ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1998 ) , in which the viscous heating is balanced by the advective cooling .",
    "it was suggested that the disk may undergo limit - cycle oscillations , like the dwarf nova outbursts ( for a review kato et al .",
    "1998 ,  10 ) .",
    "this instability is expected to occur when the mass accretion rate is comparable to or moderately exceeds the critical value , @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the eddington luminosity and @xmath9 is the velocity of light .",
    "the limit - cycle oscillations have been investigated by one - dimensional ( 1d ) , vertically - integrated approach .",
    "the quasi - periodic outbursts were first demonstrated by honma et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using the time - dependent 1d simulations of the accretion disks and have then been investigated in detail ( szuszkiewicz & miller 1997 , 1998 , 2001 ; watarai & mineshige 2003 ) .",
    "however , the 1d model can not treat the multi - dimensional motion , i.e. , convection , circulation , and outflow , although they would influence the flow dynamics significantly via the transport of mass , momentum / angular momentum , and energy .",
    "the modification of the accretion disk model , where the mass ejection from the disk surface is taken into account , was suggested by nayakshin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( see also janiuk et al . 2000 ; 2002 and janiuk & czerny 2005 ) .",
    "but they still used simplified 1d method without treating the multi - dimensional flow motion .",
    "we need to perform at least two - dimensional ( 2d ) analysis in order to understand the accretion flow correctly .",
    "recently , teresi et al . ( 2004a , 2004b ) first reproduced the quasi - periodic luminosity variations by a 2d smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations .",
    "however , their simulations focused on the time evolution of the disk itself and do not treat the optically thin regime correctly , i.e. , the disk surface as well as the atmosphere surrounding the disk .",
    "they assumed the equilibrium between gas and radiation without treating the energy of gas and radiation separately . in their simulations ,",
    "the transport of the radiation energy was not solved in the optically thin regime , though the radiation flux was evaluated by using the diffusion approximation deep inside the disk .",
    "the thermal energy was extracted from the sph particles located near the disk surface .",
    "it should be calculated by solving the interaction between gas and radiation as well as radiative transfer .",
    "their assumptions and method are valid only in the optically thick regime , i.e. , deep inside the disk . as a result , the outflow was not found in their simulations even though the luminosity exceeded the eddington luminosity in the high - luminosity state .",
    "the outflow would have an important role on the evolution of the disk through the extraction of the mass , momentum / angular momentum , and energy from the disk .",
    "in addition , the simulations for stable disks were not performed in their work .",
    "a comparison of their results with those of simulations for stable disks is essential in order to understand the physical mechanism of the disk oscillations .",
    "hence , it is important to confirm the limit - cycle behavior by the grid - based simulations , in which the multi - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) equations are properly solved .",
    "it is also important to investigate the time evolution of not only an unstable disk but also a stable disk .",
    "the photon trapping is also basically a multi - dimensional effect , by which some or large part of photons generated inside the disk is swallowed by the black hole in supercritical accretion regime , leading to a reduction of the energy conversion efficiency ( ohsuga et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "it has been reported by the analysis of the x - ray data of grs 1915 + 105 that the disk luminosity is comparable to or exceeds the eddington luminosity in the high - luminosity state ( yamaoka et al .",
    "2001 ) , implying the supercritical accretion .",
    "thus , the photon trapping is expected to appear in high - luminosity state of the quasi - periodic oscillations . here , by solving full set of 2d rhd equations including viscosity term , we report the 2d rhd model for the quasi - periodic oscillations of the accretion disks around black holes .",
    "our numerical simulations carefully treat the 2d effects , including the outflow motion and the photon trapping .",
    "we also show in our simulations that the disk is unstable on condition that the mass accretion rate is moderately larger than the critical value and the viscous stress tensor is proportional to the total pressure .",
    "it is consistent with the disk theory and proves that the bursting behavior in our simulations arises from the disk instability in the radiation - pressure dominant region . in ",
    "2 , our model and numerical method are described .",
    "we present the numerical results in  3 .",
    " 4 and  5 are devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "basic equations and our numerical method are described in detail in ohsuga et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the model and the numerical method .",
    "the set of rhd equations including the viscosity term are solved by an explicit - implicit finite difference scheme on the eulerian grids .",
    "we use spherical polar coordinates @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radial distance , @xmath12 is the polar angle , and @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle . in the present study , we assume the axisymmetry as well as the reflection symmetry relative to the equatorial plane .",
    "we also assume that only @xmath14-component of the viscous stress tensor , @xmath15 , is non zero .",
    "this component plays an important role for the transport of the angular momentum and heating of the disk plasma .",
    "we describe the gravitational field of the black hole in terms of pseudo - newtonian hydrodynamics ( paczynski & wiita 1980 ) , and assume the flow to be non self - gravitating .",
    "the basic equations are the continuity equation , @xmath16 the equations of motion , @xmath17 \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\frac { \\chi}{c } f_0^r,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath18 @xmath19 the energy equation of the gas , @xmath20 ^ 2 , \\ ] ] and the energy equation of the radiation , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the gas mass density , @xmath23 is the velocity , @xmath24 is the gas pressure , @xmath25 is the internal energy density of the gas , @xmath26 is the blackbody intensity , @xmath27 is the radiation energy density , @xmath28 is the radiation flux , @xmath29 is the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath30 is the dynamical viscosity coefficient , @xmath31 is the absorption opacity , and @xmath32 is the total opacity with @xmath33 being the thomson scattering cross - section and @xmath34 being the proton mass .    for the equation of state we use @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the specific heat ratio .",
    "the temperature of the gas , @xmath37 , can then be calculated from @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath40 is the mean molecular weight . to complete the set of equations ,",
    "we apply flux limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation developed by levermore and pomraning ( 1981 ) . adopting this approximation ,",
    "the radiation flux and the radiation pressure tensor are expressed in terms of the radiation energy density ( turner & stone 2001 , ohsuga et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in this paper , the dynamical viscosity coefficient is given by @xmath41 where @xmath0 is the viscosity parameter",
    ", @xmath42 is the keplerian angular speed , and @xmath43 is the flux limiter . in this form ,",
    "the @xmath14-component of the viscous stress tensor is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total pressure .",
    "this is because the flux limiter , @xmath43 , becomes @xmath46 in the optically thick limit , and vanishes in the optically thin limit in the framework of the fld approximation .",
    "the flux limiter , @xmath43 , is almost @xmath46 in the disk region .",
    "thus , our viscosity model is basically the same as the @xmath0 prescription of the viscosity proposed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , although @xmath43 is almost null above and below the disk .",
    "the computational domain consists of spherical shells of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and is divided into @xmath49 grid cells , where @xmath50 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we start the calculations with a hot , rarefied , and optically - thin atmosphere .",
    "there is no cold dense disk initially , and we assume that matter is continuously injected into the computational domain through the outer - disk boundary ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , we can avoid the influence of the initial configuration on the final result , although a long integration time is required .",
    "the injected matter is supposed to have a specific angular momentum corresponding to the keplerian angular momentum at @xmath53 , and we set the injected mass - accretion rate ( mass input rate ) so as to be constant at the boundary . throughout the present study ,",
    "we assume the black - hole mass to be @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . for the absorption opacity",
    ", we consider the free - free absorption and the bound - free absorption for solar metallicity ( hayashi , hoshi , & sugimito 1962 , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "figure 1 represents the time evolution of the mass accretion rate onto the black hole , @xmath58 ( blue ) , the outflow rate , @xmath59 ( magenta ) , the luminosity , @xmath60 ( red ) , and the trapped luminosity , @xmath61 ( green ) .",
    "here , the outflow rate means the ejected mass per unit time at the outer boundary of the computational domain .",
    "the luminosity is evaluated by integrating the radiation flux at the outer boundary . on the other hand , the trapped luminosity is the integration of the radiation flux at the inner boundary , which means the radiation energy swallowed by the black hole per unit time .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath60 , almost equals to the luminosity of the disk , since the emission of the less dense atmosphere surrounding the disk does not contribute very much to the luminosity .",
    "the mass input rate is set to be @xmath62 .",
    "the injected matter accumulates within the computational domain and the accretion disk forms around the black hole ( @xmath63 s ) .",
    "subsequently , the limit - cycle oscillation starts . at @xmath64s , the mass accretion rate onto the black hole ( @xmath58 )",
    "drastically varies , although the mass is continuously injected into the computational domain at constant rate .",
    "it suddenly rises , retains high value for about 40 s , and then decays .",
    "such time variation of the mass accretion rate causes the quasi - periodic luminosity changes between high- and low - luminosity states .",
    "whereas the luminosity ( @xmath60 ) is not more than @xmath2 in the low - luminosity state , it reaches around @xmath3 in the high - luminosity state .",
    "the burst duration is also about 40 s , which is roughly correspond to the viscous timescale , @xmath65 s. the physical mechanism of such limit - cycle oscillations is the thermal instability in the radiation - pressure dominant region ( discussed later ) .",
    "moreover , we can see in this figure that our simulations reveal two important phenomena .",
    "one of them is that the outburst is accompanied by the strong outflow . as shown in the top panel ,",
    "while the outflow rate ( @xmath59 ) is very small in the low - luminosity state , it suddenly rises together with mass accretion rate and retains the high value during the outburst .",
    "since the luminosity is larger than the eddington luminosity , the outflow is driven by the strong radiation force .",
    "another one is that the photon - trapping effects appear during the burst .",
    "it is found that the trapped luminosity ( @xmath61 ) is comparable to the luminosity in the high - luminosity state .",
    "thus , considerable number of photons falls onto the black hole , reducing the apparent luminosity , although the disk is very luminous in this state .",
    "in contrast , the photon trapping does not work effectively in the low - luminosity state .",
    "the multi - dimensional effects are significant in the high - luminosity state .",
    "to understand the difference of the disk structure between two states , we display the cross - sectional view of the density distribution in the low-(left panel ) and high - luminosity states ( right panel ) in figure 2 .",
    "the velocity vectors are overlaid in the right panel .",
    "it is clear that the disk becomes geometrically thick and is accompanied by the outflow in the high - luminosity state , whereas the thin disk forms in the low - luminosity state .",
    "further , the patchy structure as well as the circular motion appears within the disk in the high - luminosity state .",
    "they would be caused by the kelvin - helmholtz instability around the disk surface and by probably convection ( see ohsuga et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is stressed again that the multi - dimensional effects are significant in the high - luminosity state .    in figure 3 , we plot the radiation temperature profiles at the equatorial plane ( top panel ) and the effective temperature profiles ( bottom panel ) in the high- and low - luminosity states . here , the radiation temperature is evaluated as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the radiation constant , and it is roughly equivalent to the gas temperature around the equatorial plane . as shown in the top panel , the temperature of the disk is a few times larger in the high - luminosity state than in the low - luminosity state .",
    "we calculate the effective temperature by solving the radiation transfer equation in the face - on view .",
    "we find that the effective temperature is roughly proportional to @xmath68 in the low state and @xmath69 in the high state except for the very vicinity of the black hole ( see bottom panel ) .",
    "they are consistent with the relations for the standard and slim disks .    here",
    ", we need to remark that the sum of the mass accretion rate and outflow rate is about half of the mass input rate on average .",
    "it means that the total mass within the computational domain monotonically increases with time .",
    "however , the increase of the mass mainly occurs in the outer part of the disk ( @xmath70 ) , and it does not influence the time evolution of the inner part of the disk ( @xmath71 ) so much .",
    "thus , we conclude that our simulations can reproduce the quasi - periodic oscillations of an unstable disk around the black hole .",
    "much longer computation time is required , compared with the present simulations , for reproducing @xmath72 on average .",
    "finally , we prove that the limit - cycle behavior in our simulations is triggered by the thermal instability in the radiation - pressure dominant region . according to the accretion disk theory",
    ", the limit - cycle oscillations occur when two conditions are satisfied .",
    "one of them is that the mass accretion rate is moderately high , @xmath73 .",
    "another one is that the viscous stress tensor is proportional to the total pressure . to investigate the physical mechanism of the oscillations in our simulations",
    ", we study whether or not the limit - cycle oscillations occur by assuming @xmath74 ( comparison model a ) and @xmath75 ( comparison model b ) .",
    "the top panel in figure 4 shows the time evolution of the mass accretion rate as well as the luminosity of the comparison model a. the viscosity prescription is the same as that of the original model , that is , @xmath76 in the disk .",
    "as shown in the panel , it is found that the disk becomes a quasi - steady ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "this represents that the disk is stabilized when the mass accretion rate highly exceeds the critical value . on the other hand",
    ", the disk with the viscosity model of @xmath75 does also not exhibit the limit - cycle oscillations .",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath58 and @xmath60 of the comparison model b in the bottom panel . in this model , although the disk is not quasi - steady yet ( @xmath79 ) , the mass accretion rate is high enough to give rise to the instability in the case of @xmath76 ( chen and taam 1993 , see also kato et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the elapse time exceeds the viscous timescale in the inner region , @xmath80 s. it means that the viscosity model of @xmath75 does not cause the disk instability .",
    "since we succeed in reproducing the prediction of the disk theory , we can conclude that recurrent outbursts in our simulations are caused by the disk instability in the radiation - pressure dominant region .",
    "resulting light curve in our simulations gives a nice fit to the time variation of the luminosity of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "based on the analysis of the data of grs 1915 + 105 taken by rxte and asca , yamaoka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have produced the light curve ( see also watarai & mineshige 2003 ) .",
    "the luminosity is several times higher in the high - luminosity state than in the low - luminosity state .",
    "the duration of the high - luminosity state is about @xmath81 s , and there is sharp edges between the high and low states .",
    "our numerical results succeed in reproducing these observed features as shown in figure 1 .    in our simulations ,",
    "the observed bursting behavior is reproduced using the simple @xmath0 prescription of the viscosity proposed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "[ note that our viscosity model gives @xmath76 inside the disk as we have already mentioned .",
    "] this also might be purely 2d effect , since the modification of the viscosity model is required by the 1d simulations .",
    "watarai & mineshige ( 2003 ) explained the x - ray observations of grs 1915 + 105 using @xmath82 .",
    "some authors have proposed the phenomenological viscosity model , in which the effects of the dissipation of the energy in disk corona or in jets are simply taken into consideration ( nayakshin et al .",
    "2000 ; janiuk et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 , 2005 ) , to match the observed burst duration and luminosity .",
    "the multi - dimensional motion , which is treated in our simulations , would affect the time evolution of the disk .",
    "the mass , momentum / angular momentum , and energy are extracted from the disk by the outflow and transported by the convective motion and circulation . through these multi - dimensional effects ,",
    "the viscosity law might practically change and affect the limit - cycle behavior of the disk . to investigate the role of the multi - dimensional motion for the time evolution of the disk in detail",
    "is left as a future work .",
    "the radial profiles of the temperature and pressure of the disk in our ( grid - based ) simulations look similar to those of the sph simulations ( case 2 in teresi et al .",
    "the temperature of the disk is a few times larger in the high - luminosity state than in the low - luminosity state ( see top panel in figure 3 ) , and the radiation pressure exceeds the gas pressure by more than two orders of magnitude in the high state .",
    "however , the duration time of the low - luminosity state in their sph simulations is quite differ from our results . in their simulations",
    ", the disk stays in the low state for a few second and it does not agree with observations of grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. janiuk & czerny 2005 ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that the duration time of the low state is roughly comparable to that of the high state .",
    "also , the luminosity is a few times larger in their simulations than in our study , although the relatively small mass - input rate , @xmath83 , is employed in their simulations ( we set @xmath84 in the present work ) .",
    "these discrepancies may arise from the difference of the method of the numerical calculations .",
    "also , the treatment of the multi - dimensional effects might lead to the difference of the time evolution of the disk .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the outflow motion as well as the photon trapping are carefully treated in our simulations , although the sph simulations by teresi et al ( 2004b ) focused on the time evolution of the disk only .",
    "although we investigate the disk instability in the framework of the @xmath0 prescription of the viscosity , the realistic formalism about the viscosity should be investigated from the magneto - hydrodynamical point of view ( e.g. , machida et al .",
    "2000 ; stone & pringle 2001 ) .",
    "we need radiation mhd simulations as future work .",
    "by performing the 2d rhd simulations , we investigate the time evolution of the accretion disks around the black holes and find the limit - cycle oscillations . in this study , we carefully treat the 2d effects including the outflow and the photon trapping .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    \\(1 ) the luminosity sharply rises from @xmath85 to @xmath86 in our simulations .",
    "duration of the high - luminosity state is about @xmath81 s. the resulting variation amplitude and duration nicely fit to the observations of microquasar , grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "\\(2 ) it is also found that the 2d effects are significant in the high - luminosity state . in this state ,",
    "the trapped luminosity is comparable to the luminosity due to the effective photon trapping .",
    "the outflow , circular motion , and patchy structure appear in this state .",
    "the outflow is driven by the strong radiation force .",
    "\\(3 ) the physical mechanism , which causes the limit - cycle oscillations , is the thermal instability in the radiation - pressure dominant region . in our simulations ,",
    "the disk is stabilized when the mass accretion rate highly exceeds the critical value .",
