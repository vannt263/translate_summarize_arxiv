    "the kolkata paise restaurant ( kpr ) problem @xcite is a repeated game , played between a large number @xmath0 of agents having no interaction amongst themselves . in kpr problem ,",
    "prospective customers ( agents ) choose from @xmath0 restaurants each evening simultaneously ( in parallel decision mode ) ; @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "each restaurant has the same price for a meal but a different rank ( agreed upon by all customers ) and can serve only one customer any evening .",
    "information regarding the customer distributions for earlier evenings is available to everyone .",
    "each customer s objective is to go to the restaurant with the highest possible rank while avoiding the crowd so as to be able to get dinner there .",
    "if more than one customer arrives at any restaurant on any evening , one of them is randomly chosen ( each of them are anonymously treated ) and is served .",
    "the rest do not get dinner that evening .    in kolkata",
    ", there were very cheap and fixed rate ",
    "paise restaurants \" that were popular among the daily laborers in the city . during lunch hours",
    ", the laborers used to walk ( to save the transport costs ) to one of these restaurants and would miss lunch if they got to a restaurant where there were too many customers . walking down to the next restaurant would mean failing to report back to work on time !",
    "paise is the smallest indian coin and there were indeed some well - known rankings of these restaurants , as some of them would offer tastier items compared to the others .",
    "a more general example of such a problem would be when the society provides hospitals ( and beds ) in every locality but the local patients go to hospitals of better rank ( commonly perceived ) elsewhere , thereby competing with the local patients of those hospitals .",
    "unavailability of treatment in time may be considered as lack of the service for those people and consequently as ( social ) wastage of service by those unattended hospitals .    a social planner s ( or dictator s ) solution to the kpr problem is the following : the planner ( or dictator s ) asks everyone to form a que and then assigns each one a restaurant with rank matching the sequence of the person in the que on the first evening .",
    "then each person is told to go to the next ranked restaurant in the following evening ( for the person in the last ranked restaurant this means going to the first ranked restaurant ) .",
    "this shift process than continuous for successive evenings .",
    "call this solution the _ fair social norm_. this is clearly one of the most efficient solution ( with utilization fraction @xmath2 of the services by the restaurants equal to unity ) and the system arrives at this this solution immediately ( from the first evening itself )",
    ". however , in reality this can not be the true solution of the kpr problem , where each agent decides on his own ( in parallel or democratically ) every evening , based on complete information about past events . in this game ,",
    "the customers try to evolve a learning strategy to eventually get dinners at the best possible ranked restaurant , avoiding the crowd .",
    "it is seen , the evolution these strategies take considerable time to converge and even then the eventual utilization fraction @xmath3 is far below unity . the kpr problem",
    "have some basic features similar to the minority game problem @xcite in that diversity is encourage ( compared to herding behavior ) in both , while it differs from ( two - choice ) minority games in terms of the macroscopic size of the choices .",
    "as already shown in ref @xcite , a simple random - choice algorithm , if adapted by all the agents , can lead to a reasonable value of utilization fraction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "compared to this , several seemingly `` more intelligent '' stochastic algorithms lead to lower utilization of the services .",
    "@xcite studied a few more such `` smarter '' algorithms , having several attractive features ( including analytical estimate possibilities ) , but still failing to improve the overall utilization fraction beyond its random choice value . here",
    "we develop a stochastic strategy , which maintains a naive tendency ( probability decreasing with past crowd size ) to stick to any agent s own past choice ( successful or not ) , leading to a maximum , so far , value of the utilization fraction @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) in the kpr problem .",
    "we also estimate here analytically the @xmath2 values for several of such strategies .",
    "let the symmetric stochastic strategy chosen by each agent be such that at any time @xmath6 , the probability @xmath7 to arrive at the @xmath8-th ranked restaurant is given by @xmath9,\\hspace{.1 in } z=\\sum_{k=1}^n\\left[k^{\\alpha}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{n_k(t-1)}{t}\\right)\\right],\\label{generalstoch}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the number of agents arriving at the @xmath8-th ranked restaurant in period @xmath6 , @xmath11 is a scaling factor and @xmath12 is an exponent . note that under ( [ generalstoch ] ) the probability of selecting a particular restaurant increases with its rank and decreases with its popularity in the immediate past ( given by the number @xmath13 ) .",
    "certain properties of the strategies given by ( [ generalstoch ] ) are the following :    1 .   for @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 corresponds to the complete random choice case for which we know @xcite that the utilization fraction is around @xmath17 , that is on an average there is 63% utilization of the restaurants ( see appendix a ) .",
    "2 .   for @xmath14 and @xmath18 ,",
    "the agents avoid those restaurants visited last evening and choose again randomly from the remaining restaurants @xcite . with appropriate simulation it was shown that the distribution of the fraction @xmath19 of utilization of the restaurants is gaussian around @xmath20 ( see subsection 2.2 ) .      for any natural number @xmath21 and @xmath15",
    ", an agent goes to the @xmath8-th ranked restaurant with probability @xmath22 ; which means in the limit @xmath15 in ( [ generalstoch ] ) gives @xmath22 .",
    "let us discuss the results for such a strategy here .",
    "if an agent selects any restaurant with equal probability @xmath23 then probability that a single restaurant is chosen by @xmath24 agents is given by @xmath25    therefore , the probability that a restaurant with rank @xmath8 is not chosen by any of the agents will be given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 hence @xmath28    therefore the average fraction of agents getting dinner in the @xmath8-th ranked restaurant is given by @xmath29    ) versus rank of the restaurants ( @xmath8 ) for different @xmath21 values .",
    "the inset shows the distribution @xmath30 of the fraction @xmath19 agent getting dinner any evening for different @xmath21 values . ]    and the numerical estimates of @xmath31 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . naturally for @xmath14 , the problem corresponding to random choice @xmath32 , giving @xmath33 and for @xmath34 , @xmath35 giving @xmath36 as already obtained analytically earlier ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we consider here the case ( see also @xcite)where each agent chooses on any evening ( @xmath6 ) randomly among the restaurants in which nobody had gone in the last evening ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this correspond to the case where @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ generalstoch ] ) .",
    "our numerical simulation results for the distribution @xmath40 of the fraction @xmath19 of utilized restaurants is again gaussian with a most probable value at @xmath41 .",
    "this can be explained in the following way : as the fraction @xmath2 of restaurants visited by the agents in the last evening is avoided by the agents this evening , the number of available restaurants is @xmath42 for this evening and is chosen randomly by all the @xmath0 agents .",
    "hence , when fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson_mm ] in appendix a ) , @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson_mm ] ) , we can write the equation for @xmath2 as    @xmath44=\\bar { f } .\\ ] ]    the solution of this equation gives @xmath41 .",
    "this result agrees well with the numerical results for this limit ( @xmath14 , @xmath39 ) .      in this section",
    "we start with the following stochastic strategy : if an agent goes to restaurant @xmath8 in period ( @xmath37 ) then the agent goes to the same restaurant in the next period with probability @xmath45 and to any other restaurant @xmath46 with probability @xmath47 . in this process , the average utilization fraction is @xmath48 and the distribution @xmath40 is a gaussian around @xmath49 ( see fig . [ fig2 ] )",
    ".    an approximate estimate of @xmath2 : let @xmath50 denote the fraction of restaurants where exactly @xmath51 agents @xmath52 appeared on any evening and assume that @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and hence @xmath57 . given",
    "the strategy , @xmath58 fraction of agents will make attempts to leave their respective restaurants in the next evening @xmath59 , while no intrinsic activity will occur on the restaurants where , no body came ( @xmath60 ) or only one came ( @xmath61 ) in the previous evening @xmath62 .",
    "these @xmath58 fraction of agents will now get equally divided ( each in the remaining @xmath63 restaurants ) . of these @xmath58 ,",
    "the fraction going to the vacant restaurants ( @xmath60 in the earlier evening ) is @xmath64 .",
    "hence the new fraction of vacant restaurants is now @xmath65 . in restaurants having",
    "exactly two agents ( @xmath58 percent in the last evening ) , some vacancy will be created due to this process , and this is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "steady state implies that @xmath67 and hence using @xmath57 we get @xmath68 , giving @xmath69 and @xmath70 . of course",
    ", the above calculation is approximate as none of the restaurant is assumed to get more than two costumers on any evening ( @xmath53 for @xmath71 ) .",
    "the advantage in assuming @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath58 only to be non vanishing on any evening is that the activity of redistribution on the next evening starts from this @xmath58 fraction of the restaurants .",
    "this of course affects @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the next evening and for steady state these changes must balance .",
    "the computer simulation results also conform that @xmath72 for @xmath71 and hence the above approximation does not lead to serious error .",
    "in this section we assume that agents have two possible exogenously given values of @xmath21 : @xmath14 or @xmath34 .",
    "we start by taking some random allocation of @xmath21 over the set of @xmath0 agents .",
    "the strategy followed by each agent thereafter is the following : if an agent starts with an @xmath73 and fails to get dinner for the successive @xmath74 evenings then , in the next evening , the agent shifts to @xmath75 .",
    "the steady state distribution of the @xmath21 values in the population of agents do not depend on the initial allocation of @xmath21 values in the population ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . however , as in obvious , for large values of @xmath76 , the stability of the distribution disappears .    .",
    "the same for @xmath34 will be given by just complementary function . ]",
    "in the kpr problem if the rational agents interact then a _ fair social norm _ that can evolve is a periodically organized state with periodicity @xmath0 where each agent in turn gets served in all the @xmath0 restaurants and all agents get served every evening . can we find deterministic strategies ( in the absence of a dictator ) such that the society achieves this fair social norm ?",
    "there is one variant of pavlov s win shift lose stay strategy ( see @xcite ) that can be adopted to achieve the fair social norm and another variant that can be adopted to achieve the fair social norm in an asymptotic sense .",
    "of course , these strategies are deterministic in nature .",
    "the fair strategy works as follows :    1 .   at time",
    "( evening ) @xmath77 , agents can choose any restaurants either randomly or deterministically .",
    "2 .   if at time @xmath6 agent @xmath51 was in a restaurant ranked @xmath8 and was served then , at time @xmath78 , the agent moves to the restaurant ranked @xmath79 if @xmath80 and moves to the restaurant ranked @xmath0 if @xmath81 .",
    "3 .   if agent @xmath51 was in a restaurant ranked @xmath8 at time @xmath6 and was not served then , at time @xmath82 , the agent goes to the same restaurant .",
    "it is easy to verify that this strategy gives a convergence to the fair social norm in less than or equal to @xmath0 periods .",
    "moreover , after convergence is achieved , the fair social norm is retained ever after .",
    "the difficulty with this strategy is that a myopic agent will find it hard to justify the action of going to the restaurant ranked last after getting served in the best ranked restaurant .",
    "however , if the agent is not that myopic and observes the past history of strategies played by all the agents and can figure out that this one evening loss is a tacit commitment devise for this kind of symmetric strategies to work then this voluntary loss is not that implausible .",
    "therefore one needs to run experiments before arguing for or against this kind of symmetric deterministic strategies .",
    "more importantly the fair strategy can be modified to take care of this justification problem provided one wants to achieve the fair social norm in an asymptotic sense .",
    "the asymptotically fair strategy works as follows :    1 .   at time",
    "( evening ) @xmath77 , agents can choose any restaurants either randomly or deterministically .",
    "if at time @xmath6 agent @xmath51 was in a restaurant ranked @xmath8 and was served then , at time @xmath82 , the agent moves to the restaurant ranked @xmath79 if @xmath80 and goes to the same restaurant if @xmath83 .",
    "if agent @xmath51 was in a restaurant ranked @xmath8 at time @xmath6 and was not served then , at time @xmath78 , the agent goes to the restaurant ranked @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the kpr problem where the decision made by each agent in each time period @xmath6 is independent and is based on the information about the rank @xmath8 of the restaurants and their occupancy given by the numbers @xmath84 .",
    "we consider here in sec .",
    "@xmath85 several stochastic strategies where each agent chooses the @xmath8-th ranked restaurant with probability @xmath7 given by eq .",
    "( [ generalstoch ] ) .",
    "the utilization fraction @xmath86 of the @xmath8-th ranked restaurants on every evening is studied and their average ( over @xmath8 ) distributions @xmath40 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for some special cases . from numerical studies ,",
    "we find their distributions to be gaussian with the most probable utilization fraction @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath20 for the cases with @xmath14 , @xmath89 ; @xmath34 , @xmath89 ; and @xmath14 , @xmath39 respectively .",
    "for the stochastic crowd - avoiding strategy discussed on sec .",
    "@xmath90 , we get the best utilization fraction @xmath91 .",
    "the analytical estimates for @xmath2 in these limits are also given and they agree very well with the numerical observations .    finally , we suggest ways to achieve the fair social norm either exactly in the presence of incentive problem or asymptotically in the absence of such incentive problem . implementing or achieving such a norm in a decentralized way is impossible when @xmath92 limit .",
    "the kpr problem has similarity with the minority game problem @xcite as in both the games , herding behavior is punished and diversity s encouraged .",
    "also , both involves learning of the agents from the past successes etc . of course , kpr has some simple exact solution limits , a few of which are discussed here . in none of these cases considered here ,",
    "learning strategies are individualistic ; rather all the agents choose following the probability given by eq .",
    "( [ generalstoch ] ) . in a few different limits of such a learning strategy ,",
    "the average utilization fraction @xmath2 and their distributions are obtained and compared with the analytic estimates , which are reasonably close .",
    "needless to mention , the real challenge is to design algorithms of learning mixed strategies ( e.g. , from the pool discussed here ) by the agents so that the fair social norm emerges eventually even when every one decides on the basis of their own information independently .",
    "as we have seen , some naive strategies give better values of @xmath2 compared to most of the `` smarter '' strategies like strict crowd - avoiding strategies ( sec @xmath93 ) etc .",
    "this observation in fact compares well with earlier observation in minority games ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it may be noted that all the stochastic strategies , being parallel in computational mode , have the advantage that they converge to solution at smaller time steps ( @xmath94 or weakly dependent on @xmath0 ) while for deterministic strategies the convergence time is typically of order of @xmath0 , which renders such strategies useless in the truly macroscopic ( @xmath92 ) limits .",
    "however , deterministic strategies are useful when @xmath0 is small and rational agents can design appropriate punishment schemes for the deviators ( see @xcite ) .    in brief",
    ", the study of the kpr problem shows that while a dictated solution leads to one of the best possible solution to the problem , with each agent getting his dinner at the best ranked restaurant with a period of @xmath0 evenings , and with best possible value of @xmath3 ( @xmath95 ) starting from the first evening itself .",
    "the parallel decision strategies ( employing evolving algorithms by the agents , and past informations , e.g. , of @xmath96 ) , which are necessarily parallel among the agents and stochastic ( as in democracy ) , are less efficient ( @xmath97 ; the best one discussed here in sec . @xmath90 , giving @xmath98 only ) .",
    "we also note that most of the `` smarter '' strategies lead to much lower efficiency .",
    "is there an upper bound for the value of utilization fraction @xmath2 ( less than unity ; easily achieved in the dictated solution ) for such stochastic strategies employed in parallel ( democratically ) by the agents in kpr ?",
    "if so , what is this upper bound value ? also , what is the learning time required to arrive at such a solution ( compared to zero waiting time to arriving at the most efficient dictated solution ) in kpr ?",
    "these are the questions are to be investigated in future .",
    "the authors would like to thank anindya sundar chakrabarti and satya ranjan chakravarty for useful comments and discussions .",
    "suppose there are @xmath99 agents and @xmath0 restaurants .",
    "an agents can select any restaurant with equal probability .",
    "therefore , the probability that a single restaurant is chosen by @xmath24 agents is given by a poission distribution in the limit @xmath92 : @xmath100 therefore the fraction of restaurants not chosen by any agents is given by @xmath101 and that implies that average fraction of restaurants occupied on any evening is given by @xcite    @xmath102    in the kpr problem .",
    "in this case , an agent goes to the @xmath8-th ranked restaurant with probability @xmath103 ; that is , @xmath7 given by ( [ generalstoch ] ) in the limit @xmath34 , @xmath15 . starting with @xmath0 restaurants and @xmath0 agents , we make @xmath104 pairs of restaurants and each pair has restaurants ranked @xmath8 and @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , an agent chooses any pair of restaurant with uniform probability @xmath107 or @xmath0 agents chooses randomly from @xmath104 pairs of restaurants .",
    "therefore the fraction of pairs selected by the agents ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson_mm ] ) )    @xmath108    also , the expected number of restaurants occupied in a pair of restaurants with rank @xmath8 and @xmath105 by a pair of agents is @xmath109 therefore , the fraction of restaurants occupied by pairs of agents @xmath110 hence , the actual fraction of restaurants occupied by the agents is    @xmath111",
