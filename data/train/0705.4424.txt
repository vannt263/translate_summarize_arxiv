    "high-@xmath3 superconductivity occurs in doped mott - insulators @xcite , electronic states which are insulating because of dominating electron - electron interactions and characterized by spin - only antiferromagnetism .",
    "the study of the fate of this magnetism in the doped , superconducting systems has been on the forefront of high- research from the very beginning with inelastic neutron scattering being the primary source of experimental information .",
    "this is now well documented in the hole doped ( p - type ) superconductors where one finds the famous `` hourglass '' spectrum of magnetic fluctuations @xcite , but the interpretation of these findings has been subject of severe controversy . on the one hand",
    "this can be interpreted as the signature of strong interaction physics , where the magnetic fluctuations signal the competition between superconductivity and incommensurate , mott - like antiferromagnetism ( the `` stripes '' ) @xcite : what matters most in this interpretation is that it is envisaged that the measurements reflect the quantum dynamics of competing , highly collective order parameter fields @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that these data find also a credible interpretation in terms of conventional fermi - liquid ( fl ) physics @xcite . here",
    ", it is asserted that the electron system renormalizes in a weakly interacting fermi - gas , acquiring a conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) gap in the superconducting state .",
    "the residual interactions then give rise to weakly bound states residing in the gap formed in the non - interacting particle - hole spectrum , governed by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .    only very recently inelastic neutron scattering data became available for the magnetic fluctuations in the electron doped ( n - type ) superconductor pr@xmath0lace@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( plcco ) @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a dynamical peak ( resonance ) at an energy @xmath4 mev residing at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath5 whereas the incommensurate branches ( wings ) found in the p - type superconductors in the vicinity of the resonance are conspicuously absent .    here",
    "we will employ tunneling spectra obtained for the same sample as used for the neutron measurement , in combination with angular resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) by others on a similar sample to characterize the fermionic quasiparticle excitations in great detail .",
    "we subsequently use this information to derive the magnetic spectrum employing the rpa , to find out that there is a profound disagreement between the theoretical predictions for the magnetic fluctuations coming from this fermiology interpretation and the measurements @xcite . in particular , ( i ) this framework predicts a very asymmetric almost step - like feature slightly above the edge of the particle - hole continuum instead of a sharp resonance peak seen in neutron scattering ,",
    "( ii ) it suggests a strong temperature dependence of the resonance feature , both in intensity and position , inconsistent with the data , ( iii ) it underestimates the absolute intensity of the resonance by an order of magnitude , and finally ( iv ) it predicts that most of the spectral weight resides in incommensurate wings below the resonance feature in clear contradiction to the data @xcite .",

    "the dispersing incommensurate wings merging into the commensurate resonance peak at @xmath16 are interpreted as a dispersing bound state formed in the gap below the particle - hole continuum .",

    "[ sec.res ] we have seen that for @xmath107 mev the fl / rpa approach reproduces a feature at @xmath69 mev .",
    "however , since this feature is located at an energy above the gap of the particle - hole continuum its lineshape and spectral weight are inconsistent with the experimental observations .",
    "we start with a momentum independent four - point vertex @xmath108 ( hubbard - like approximation ) which in the the case of p - type compounds turns out to give a pretty good description of the magnetic excitation spectra@xcite , much better than for a strong momentum dependent @xmath8@xcite .    using a constant @xmath67 mev producing a resonance feature at the experimentally observed energy @xmath69 mev@xcite",
    "the fl / rpa predicts for the n - type superconductor the spectrum shown in figure [ plcco ] : this spectrum is dominated by strong incommensurate wings below the resonance which are in fact predicted to be much more pronounced than in the case of the p - type superconductors .",
    "this is precisely opposite to the experimental findings where the incommensurate fluctuations are pronounced in the p - type systems , but completely absent in the n - type superconductor !    including a small @xmath42-modulation of the form @xmath109 $ ] as used recently@xcite with a relative modulation @xmath110 to obtain a slightly better quantitative agreement with continuously improving neutron scattering data on optimally doped ybco , does not lead to significant improvements but only to a small change of the incommensurability of the wings .",
    "the only way to repair this gross inconsistency is by invoking a @xmath8 which sharply peaks at @xmath16 .",
    "recently , it was argued@xcite that by taking a full momentum dependent four - point vertex ( @xmath111 ) , @xmath112/2 $ ] , the incommensurate wings can be suppressed .",
    "this strongly momentum - dependent form of the four - point vertex peaking at @xmath16 was motivated by the proximity of the superconducting and ( commensurate ) antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "however , such a form of the four - point vertex is clearly unphysical since it corresponds to a nearest neighbor exchange whereas the onsite coulomb repulsion which is known to control the mottness in the copper oxide planes is completely ignored .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath113-model , in the quasiparticle picture used here double occupancies are not projected out . moreover , using our set of quasiparticle parameters ( tab .",
    "[ par ] ) , this would imply an effective superexchange of @xmath114 mev which is about 5 times bigger than in the parent undoped compounds@xcite . while this is obviously unphysical , the value @xmath115 mev taken in ref .",
    "is even much bigger .",
    "the reason why incommensurate wings at low energies appear generically within the fl / rpa approach for any realistic set of parameters both for p - type and n - type materials is actually a very generic one , rooted in the assumption that there is a direct relation between the free particle - hole and the magnetic spectrum . within this framework ,",
    "the rpa response @xmath17 for any realistic form of @xmath8 basically reflects the momentum dependence of the gap of the ph - continuum nicely seen in the bare lindhard function @xmath20 ( fig . [ chi0 ] ) .",
    "the superconducting @xmath6-wave gap is close to its maximum for particle - hole pairs separated by @xmath16 and goes continuously down if we move away from the antiferromagnetic to incommensurate wavevectors separations ( see figs .",
    "[ gap],[disp ] ) .",
    "the gap of the ph - contiuum closes at the incommensurate wavevectors connecting points of the fermi surface coinciding with the nodes of the @xmath6-wave gap .",
    "although the momentum dependence of the gap of the particle - hole continuum looks very similar in the p - type and n - type case , a crucial difference becomes apparent when comparing the distribution of the spectral weight @xmath20 . whereas in p - type ybco spectral weight is accumulated at @xmath16 the intensity in the close vicinity of the antiferromagnetic wavevector is strongly suppressed in n - type plcco . on the other hand the spectral weight at incommensurate momenta is strongly enhanced in the n - type compound ( fig .",
    "[ chi0 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the reshuffling of the weight in the bare lindhard function @xmath20 from @xmath16 to incommensurate wave vectors in going from p- to n - type superconductors is simply related to the number of particle - hole pairs contributing to the magnetic response . in fig .",
    "[ disp ] we compare the normal state dispersions , fermi surfaces , and fermi velocities of ybco and plcco .",
    "whereas in ybco the saddle - points in the band structure responsible for the van hove singularities at the antinodal points are very close to points on the fermi surface separated by @xmath16 , in plcco the bands are very steep at points connected by @xmath16 and a nesting of the fermi surface for incommensurate wavevectors in regions of very flat bands give rise to the drastic spectral weight enhancement of the wings .",
    "to summarize , by combining experimental measurements of the quasiparticle and dynamical magnetic properties we have demonstrated that in a n - type cuprate superconductor the magnetic excitations to be expected from a weakly interacting fermi - gas are inconsistent with experimental observations .",
    "in particular , we have performed tunneling experiments on the same sample of plcco showing a magnetic resonance in the superconducting phase @xcite and used arpes data@xcite on a similar sample to extract normal - state band structure and @xmath6-wave gap parameters . the neutron scattering raw data on the magnetic resonance@xcite we have converted to absolute units by normalization to acoustic phonons .    using the detailed information on the quasiparticles obtained from the arpes and tunneling experiments we have calculated the expected magnetic excitation spectrum within the conventional fl / rpa framework which assumes that there is a direct relation between the free particle - hole and the magnetic spectrum .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical results with the magnetic fluctuation measured in inelastic neutron scattering shows that the fermiology approach fails to explain the magnetic fluctuations .    since the magnetic resonance of plcco",
    "is located at an energy near the gap of the particle - hole continuum as confirmed by our tunneling experiment , it is difficult to explain it as a bound state within the fl / rpa approach . consequently , within the fl / rpa framework we obtain an almost step - like feature rather than a symmetric resonance peak seen in experiment and underestimate the spectral weight of the resonance by an order of magnitude .",
    "additionally , taking the temperature dependence of the gap measured by our tunneling experiment , the fl / rpa approach predicts a very strong temperature dependence of the resonance well below @xmath3 inconsistent with the experimental observation .",
    "the failure of the fermiology framework is highlighted by the incommensurate wings which from the theoretical calculations are expected to be much more pronounced than in the p - type case whereas they have never been observed in electron - doped superconductors .    within the fl",
    "/ rpa approach such incommensurate wings in the magnetic response of a @xmath6-wave superconductor appear generically for any physically reasonable set of parameter , both in the p - type and n - type case .",
    "this finding is quite robust and does not depend on details of the bandstructure .",
    "however , the different forms of the quasiparticle dispersion and of the @xmath6-wave gap of plcco compared to ybco gives rise to an additional reshuffling of spectral weight in the free particle - hole spectrum from the antiferromagnetic to incommensurate wavevectors leading to an enhancement of the wings and an additional intensity loss in the close vicinity of @xmath16 .",
    "the drastic failure of the fermiology approach for the n - type case opens the question whether the apparent agreement for the p - type superconductors is just coincidental .",
    "since incommensureate wings are generically expected within the fl / rpa approach it is not surprising that one finds a reasonable agreement up to the resonance energy .",
    "however , this approach can not explain the upper branches of the hourglass spectrum seen in various experiments .",
    "more severely , the fermiology interpretation can neither account for the anomalous properties of the normal state which is known to be a non - fermi liquid nor for the persistence of the resonance and the hourglass above @xmath3 in the underdoped regime .",
    "on the other hand , above the spin gap the magnetic excitation spectra of superconducting ybco@xcite and la@xmath116sr@xmath117cuo@xmath2 @xcite are remarkably similar@xcite to that found in stripe ordered la@xmath118ba@xmath119cuo@xmath2 @xcite suggesting that the magnetic fluctuations in the p - type superconductors correspond to fluctuating stripes competing with superconductivity .",
    "theoretically , the hourglass spectrum characteristic for both , stripe ordered and superconducting p - type cuprates , has been obtained in various models for static stripes@xcite but also in a phenomenological lattice model for thermally fluctuating , short - ranged stripe order@xcite .    whereas the magnetic fluctuations in the p - type cuprates seem to reflect the competition between superconductivity and incommensurate , mott - like antiferromagnetism ( the `` stripes '' ) , incommensurate fluctuations have never been observed in n - type superconductors suggesting instead a competition with commensurate antiferromagnetism@xcite .    to conclude , by combining experimental measurements of the quasiparticle and dynamical magnetic properties we have demonstrated that in the n - type cuprate superconductor plcco there is no relation whatsoever between the magnetic excitations to be expected from a weakly interacting fermi - gas and the magnetic fluctuations observed experimentally .",
    "this demonstrates that the magnetic fluctuations actually correspond with highly collective motions which likely reflect the quantum competition between superconductivity and strongly coupled antiferromagnetism .",
    "the challenge for the theorist is to explain how this system manages to simultaneously support conventional looking fermionic quasiparticle excitations and highly collective order parameter fluctuations .",

    "<S> by combining experimental measurements of the quasiparticle and dynamical magnetic properties of optimally electron - doped pr@xmath0lace@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with theoretical calculations we demonstrate that the conventional fermiology approach can not possibly account for the magnetic fluctuations in these materials . in particular , we perform tunneling experiments on the very same sample for which a dynamical magnetic resonance has been reported recently and use photoemission data by others on a similar sample to characterize the fermionic quasiparticle excitations in great detail . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently use this information to calculate the magnetic response within the conventional fermiology framework as applied in a large body of work for the hole - doped superconductors to find a profound disagreement between the theoretical expectations and the measurements : this approach predicts a step - like feature rather than a sharp resonance peak , it underestimates the intensity of the resonance by an order of magnitude , it suggests an unreasonable temperature dependence of the resonance , and most severely , it predicts that most of the spectral weight resides in incommensurate wings which are a key feature of the hole - doped cuprates but have never been observed in the electron - doped counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> our findings strongly suggest that the magnetic fluctuations reflect the quantum - mechanical competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting orders . </S>"
