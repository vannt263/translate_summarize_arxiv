    "bob filters his output photon with a long - pass glass filter ( lp ) and a 3@xmath31 band - pass filter ( bp ) , before collecting it with an aspheric lens ( l2 , f=18.4@xmath32 ) into a single - mode fibre .",
    "he performs his measurement in an external fibre bridge , with a combination of a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) , hwp , a polarising beam displacer ( bd ) and multi - mode - fibre - coupled single - photon avalanche diodes ( spads ) . to minimise loss",
    ", alice performs her measurement directly at the source using a qwp , hwp and a polarising beamsplitter ( pbs ) , followed by a lp filter and fibre collection with focussing optics identical to bob s , finally detecting her photons with highly efficient , superconducting transition edge sensors ( tess )  @xcite .",
    "]    we followed  @xcite in the basic design of our source . to maximise the conditional coupling between the alice and bob s collection apparatus ,",
    "we optimised the pump and collection spots based on  @xcite , with the optimum found at using pump spot and collection mode diameters of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the crystal , respectively . with these parameters , we achieved typical pair detection efficiency of 40% measured with standard single - photon avalanche diodes ( spads ) , whose detection efficiency was estimated to be 50% at @xmath35 , implying a collection efficiency of 80% . due to the asymmetry of the steering task",
    ", the source and detection system do not have to be symmetric .",
    "for example , in our setup alice does not employ narrow - band filters ; this choice increases her overall background , but reduces her loss , thus increasing the detection efficiency conditioned on bob s measurement .",
    "another key requirement is high photon detection efficiency .",
    "the upper bound of the conditional detection probability @xmath24 is limited by the performance of alice s photon detectors , and therefore would not even in a loss - less , noise - free case allow us to meet the requirements of eq . with our spads and two measurement settings ; in our experiment , alice thus employs superconducting tungsten transition edge sensors  @xcite ( tess ) .",

    "signal was digitised with a constant fraction discriminator ; because the tess rethermalise after each detection event , with a relaxation period of @xmath44 , the non - number resolving discriminators were set to impose a dead time of the same length to avoid false detections during the tes relaxation period . to match the delay caused by the tes detection system , bob s spad signals",

    "coincident events were then detected with a field - programmable gate array with a timing window of 98@xmath42 .",
    "the long dead time period imposed by our electronics leads to a rate - dependent loss and we therefore operated the source at comparatively low rates of photon - pair creation .",
    "we achieved optimal conditional detection efficiency at a laser pump power of 250@xmath46 , generating @xmath47@xmath48 of single photons in each tes channel . at this rate ,",

    "our experimental violation of inequality has a quite intuitive interpretation : it shows that alice can , at her will , _ steer _ bob s qubit state to be preferably polarised along any of the three axes of the bloch sphere , see fig .",
    "[ fig : viseta ]  ( a ) .",
    "while we have closed the detection loophole , we have not addressed the locality and freedom of choice loopholes@xcite in this work ; closing these would require alice and bob s choice and implementation of measurements to be space - like separated , as demonstrated in a very recent experiment reported in  @xcite . for practical purposes in quantum communication , however , these loopholes are typically not problematic@xcite : it is a necessary assumption that alice and bob can choose their measurements independently of the state preparation , and that no unwanted information leaks from alice and bob s laboratories .    besides the criteria employed here there are others that can be used to demonstrate steering@xcite .",
    "if alice can not achieve the high heralding efficiencies obtained in our experiment , some of these may be advantageous : as recently shown in  @xcite , generalising the linear criteria of  @xcite allows for steering with arbitrarily high losses .",
    "these however require a larger number of different measurement settings ; the experiment reported in  @xcite used up to @xmath70 measurements .",
    "our choice to test inequality  ( [ steering_ineq ] ) was motivated by its simplicity in how it naturally accounts for alice s detection inefficiencies , and by its minimality in the number of settings .",
    "note that @xmath27 is the number of settings initially discussed by epr ; it is also the canonical number of settings in applications to quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "increasing alice s detection efficiency above 66% will infact enable steering to be used for quantum key distribution where one party distrusts their apparatus@xcite ; our experiment thus constitutes an important step towards practical applications of quantum steering .",
    "furthermore , our results imply that a fully loophole - free photonic bell test seems to be within arm s reach . while the symmetric photon pair detection efficiency for our setup is somewhat lower than the conditional detection probability @xmath24 , it is not far below the @xmath71  % limit required to violate a clauser - horne inequality  @xcite with non - maximally entangled states  @xcite .",
    "although still a technological challenge , it is now becoming conceivable to surpass this efficiency in the near future , while simultaneously addressing the locality and freedom - of - choice loopholes such as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "inequality  ( [ steering_ineq ] ) is equivalent to previously derived variance criteria  @xcite ; for completeness , we give here a simple proof .",
    "if the observed correlation can be explained by the source sending non - entangled states to alice and bob , then the probability distribution @xmath15 can be decomposed in the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 describes the source preparation , used with probability @xmath74 ( such that @xmath75 , @xmath76  note that the sum could in principle be continuous and infinite ) : it specifies alice s response function @xmath77 implemented by her ( untrusted ) measurement device , and the state @xmath78 sent to bob .",

    "as already highlighted , inequality is highly dependant on bob s measurements : it is only valid when bob measures mutually unbiased observables on qubits . in a practical experiment however",
    ", bob will not measure along perfectly mutually unbiased bases , and his operators may not act on a 2-dimensional system only .",
    "we show now that the parameter @xmath89 can still be used to demonstrate steering , but the upper bound in must be adapted according to bob s actual measurement .",
    "let us start by giving a more accurate description of the measurement bob performs in our experiment .",
    "first , he uses quarter- and half - wave plates , that define a direction ( _ i.e. _ , a unit vector ) @xmath90 on the bloch sphere , representing his choice of basis .",
    "the beam displacer ( bd ) then separates the @xmath91 and @xmath20 polarisations : a fraction @xmath92 of the @xmath91 polarisation goes to its first output channel , and later on to the  + 1 \" detector , while a fraction @xmath93 ( in our experiment , @xmath94 ) goes to the second output channel , and to the  -1 \" detector .",
    "we can assume that , symmetrically , a fraction @xmath95 of the @xmath20 polarisation goes to the second output channel , while a fraction @xmath96 goes to the first output channel , as we utilise a calcite beam displacer as our polarising element ; its intrinsic birefringence maps polarisation into different spatial modes , which is a fundamentally symmetric effect  @xcite other polarising elements rely on other effects , not necessarily symmetric , requiring a slightly more thorough analysis .",
    "we finally denote by @xmath97 and @xmath98 the overall detection efficiencies of the + 1 and -1 detectors ( spads ) , respectively , including all losses in bob s lab , including coupling and detection losses .    for a single photon state entering bob s lab , represented by a vector @xmath99 in the bloch sphere , the probability that it gives a click on the + 1 or -1 detector is then @xmath100 \\ , .",

    "these will however only introduce some white noise into bob s data , and can not increase the bound in the steering inequality .",
    "note finally that all the above calculations assumed that bob received qubit states , encoded in the polarisation of single photons .",
    "this is however not guaranteed , and the source could indeed send multiphoton states . these possibly lead to double clicks ; in the experiment , a negligible fraction of about 1 in @xmath121 of bob s events were double - click events .",
