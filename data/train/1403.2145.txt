    "deuteron - induced reactions , in particular ( d , p ) one - neutron transfer reactions , have been used for decades to investigate the structure of nuclei .",
    "these reactions , carried out in inverse kinematics , are expected to play a central role in the study of weakly - bound systems at modern radioactive beam facilities  @xcite . while the theoretical framework and its computational implementation for describing ( d , p )",
    "reactions have seen much progress over the decades , open questions remain and need to be addressed .",
    "resonances , for example , occur in all nuclei , and are of special interest in the low - energy spectra of weakly - bound nuclei . their properties ,",
    "in particular their energies and widths , are of great interest to nuclear astrophysics , as many reaction that occur in astrophysical environments proceed through resonances .",
    "furthermore , resonances provide both challenges and stringent tests for nuclear structure models , as predicting their properties involves a proper treatment of the nuclear many - body system including the continuum  @xcite .",
    "current theoretical descriptions of transfer reactions that populate resonance states suffer from two major shortcomings . on the practical side",
    ", one has to deal with numerical convergence issues , as the matrix element that describes the transition to the final state includes contributions from very large distances outside the nucleus .",
    "conceptually , it is also not clear what spectroscopic information can be extracted from a transfer to a resonance . a clear connection between experimental transfer observables and typical resonance parameters remains to be established .",
    "recently , a new formalism that utilizes concepts known from the successful and popular r - matrix theory was proposed for the description of deuteron - induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "r - matrix theory is a standard tool for extracting resonance properties such as energies and widths from nucleon capture and scattering experiments  @xcite , and the new approach establishes a similar link between resonance properties and transfer reactions .",
    "the formalism covers transfers to bound and resonance states , and is general enough to include deuteron breakup .    a central tenet of the formalism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the recasting of the reaction amplitude , a volume integral , in terms of a surface integral plus ( presumably small ) remnant terms that contain contributions from the interior and exterior of the final nucleus .",
    "interior and exterior are defined with respect to the distance between the transferred nucleon and the target nucleus .",
    "the surface - integral formalism , as we will refer to it here , holds the potential to overcome present difficulties in describing transfers to resonance states and to become a practical method for extracting structure information from transfer experiments , since : 1 ) it reduces the dependence of the cross section calculations on the model used for the nuclear interior ; 2 ) it avoids the convergence problems that affect traditional calculations of transfers to resonances ; and 3 ) it establishes a useful link between resonance properties and transfer observables , since the cross section obtained from the surface integral can be parameterized in terms of quantities that are familiar from traditional r - matrix approaches .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to test the formalism proposed in ref .",
    "in particular , we study the role of interior and exterior contributions to the cross sections , for both post and prior formulations of the transfer amplitudes .",
    "this allows us to draw some conclusions about the sensitivity of the post and prior expressions to model assumptions made about the nuclear interior .",
    "we then investigate the relative contributions from the surface term and the residual interior and exterior terms to the transfer cross section and the dependence of these contributions on the chosen radius @xmath0 at which the surface integral is evaluated .",
    "this is done in order to assess to which extent the surface term captures the essentials of the reaction and reproduces the full cross section .",
    "the calculations are carried out in the framework of the dwba formalism .",
    "the implications for generalizing the study to the continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) formalism  @xcite , which incorporates effects of deuteron breakup in the reaction , are briefly considered .    in the next section ,",
    "section  [ sec_formalism ] , we summarize the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular the introduction of ` exterior ' and ` interior ' contributions to the transfer matrix element and the emergence of a surface term . in section  [ sec_study ] , we investigate the contributions of the interior , surface , and exterior terms to the transfer cross sections .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "in the r - matrix approach for a binary reaction  @xcite , the configuration space is separated into two regions : an exterior region , in which the reaction partners are well - separated and interact only via the coulomb interaction ( for charged particles ) , and an interior region , where a confined compound system exists that is governed by nuclear and coulomb forces .",
    "formally , the nuclear wave function in the interior is expanded in some suitable set of basis functions , while in the exterior , it takes the form of a scattering wave function , and matching conditions are imposed at the surface . in typical applications , the parameters ( resonance energies and width parameters ) are adjusted to reproduce measured cross sections .",
    "this approach makes it possible to parameterize the collision matrix , and thus the calculated cross section , in terms of a few formal r - matrix parameters , which can then be related to observed quantities .",
    "r - matrix theory  @xcite is typically employed in the description of binary reactions , such as elastic or inelastic scattering , or capture reactions , but the underlying ideas can be applied more generally .    for reactions of the type @xmath1(d , p)@xmath2 , where @xmath1 denotes the target and",
    "@xmath2 the residual nucleus , mukhamedzhanov  @xcite introduced an analogous separation of the model space into interior and exterior regions .",
    "the separation into the different regions is based on the distance @xmath3 of the deposited neutron from the center of the target nucleus . the standard distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) transition matrix element",
    "can be written in post or prior form  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the wave functions of the initial ( @xmath1 ) and final ( @xmath7 ) nuclei , respectively , and @xmath8 @xmath9 is the associated overlap function , which depends on the coordinate of interest , @xmath3 . in applications ,",
    "this is typically approximated by a single - particle wave function obtained from a potential - model calculation  @xcite .",
    "the distorted waves in the entrance and exit channels are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath12 is the deuteron wave function .",
    "post and prior forms require different transition operators @xmath13 respectively . in the post form , @xmath14 contains the interaction between the proton and the target nucleus ( @xmath15 ) , the proton - neutron interaction ( @xmath16 ) , and the optical potential for the exit channel ( @xmath17 ) , while in the prior form , @xmath18 contains the interaction between the neutron and the target ( @xmath19 ) , the proton and the target ( @xmath15 ) , and the optical potential in the entrance channel ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the interactions include both nuclear and coulomb terms . in the first - order distorted - wave approach , post and",
    "prior formulations give identical matrix elements , provided the interactions and wave functions are chosen consistently  @xcite .",
    "this implies , e.g. , that the deuteron wave function @xmath12 has to be an eigenfunction of the potential @xmath16 ( prior form ) , and that the overlap function @xmath21 has to be an eigenfunction of @xmath19 ( post form ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 and @xmath17 have to be consistent with the distorted waves @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    while post and prior forms are equivalent , historically there has been a preference for using the post formalism for describing ( d , p ) reactions . one advantage of using the transition operator in eq .",
    "[ eq_transop_post ] over using the one in eq .",
    "[ eq_transop_prior ] is that it lends itself to the approximation @xmath22 and @xmath16 is short - ranged , which makes it possible to treat the interaction between proton and neutron inside the deuteron in a zero - range approximation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the johnson - soper model  @xcite , an early description of deuteron stripping and elastic scattering that includes the effects of deuteron breakup , is formulated in the post form and makes use of the zero - range approximation .",
    "similarly , the johnson - tandy  @xcite extension of the model to finite range uses the post form .",
    "one disadvantage of the post form , however , is that for stripping reactions that populate resonance final states , convergence becomes difficult . unlike in the prior case , where contributions from the long tails of resonance wave functions are suppressed by the short - range nature of the interactions in eq .",
    "[ eq_transop_prior ] , post calculations typically have contributions from the resonance wave function at very large distances @xmath3 , due to the @xmath16 term .    in both the post and prior formulations , the transition matrix element can be separated into two parts , @xmath23 where @xmath0 refers to the specific value chosen for the coordinate @xmath3 , for which to carry out the separation .",
    "the interior term involves an integration from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , while the exterior term involves an integration from @xmath25 to very large radii , @xmath26 . in section  [ sec_study ]",
    ", we will illustrate that for typical ( d , p ) transfer reactions and separation radii roughly equal to the size of the target nucleus , the main contributions to the post form matrix element come from the exterior region , while the prior form matrix element is dominated by interior contributions from further inside the nucleus .",
    "this is significant , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was further demonstrated that green s theorem can be employed to convert the post - form exterior matrix element into a surface integral plus a prior - form exterior matrix element : @xmath27    using this in the post version of eq .",
    "[ eq_intext ] , the full dwba matrix element becomes : @xmath28 the same result is obtained if one starts with a consideration of the prior form and expresses the interior part in terms of a surface integral and remaining contributions from the interior , @xmath29    the interior post term in eq .",
    "[ eq_msurf ] involves an integration over the overlap function @xmath8 for small @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e.  _ it depends on a model for the nuclear interior .",
    "the exterior prior and surface terms , on the other hand , are related to the asymptotic properties of the overlap function , as long as @xmath0 is outside the boundary of the neutron binding potential .    for transfer reactions that populate resonance reactions",
    ", this surface formulation is particularly attractive . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the surface term @xmath30 , which is evaluated at a specific radius @xmath0 , can be parameterized by quantities that are familiar from traditional r - matrix approaches , namely a channel radius ( here the separation radius @xmath0 ) , logarithmic boundary conditions ( here logarithmic derivatives of known hankel functions ) , and reduced - width amplitudes ( here related to the asymptotic normalization of the overlap function ) .",
    "thus , a useful link between resonance properties and transfer observables could be established .",
    "a dominant surface matrix element would reduce the dependence of the cross section calculations on the model used for the interior portion of the overlap function .    in the next section",
    "we investigate the relative contributions of interior , surface , and exterior terms , for various target nuclei and at various reaction energies .",
    "we will focus on the dwba implementation .",
    "transfer cross sections calculated in the dwba framework are proportional to the square of the full matrix element @xmath31 given in eqs .",
    "[ eq_intext ] and [ eq_intsurext ] . to better assess the relevance of the various contributions for realistic situations , we begin with a full cross section calculation , with model parameters selected to reasonably reproduce measured ( d , p ) cross sections .",
    "we then repeat each cross section calculation with all contributions other than the term of interest set to zero and compare the resulting cross section to the full calculation .",
    "this comparison is made in one of two ways : 1 ) we compare the peak cross section obtained in the restricted calculation to that obtained in the full calculation .",
    "this is done when we are interested in the dependence of the contribution on the separation radius @xmath0 . in that case",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the peak value of the full cross section , and @xmath34 is the peak value of the cross section obtained by including only the term @xmath35 , for @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath30 , or @xmath38 .",
    "we consider the first ( smallest - angle ) peak , as this peak plays a prominent role in comparisons of calculations with experimental data .",
    "2 ) for specific cases of interest , we also compare the angular behavior of the cross section @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "focusing in particular on @xmath41 allows us to assess to which extent the surface term is able to describe the reaction considered .    in our study , we included target nuclei from different mass regions and considered different beam energies . here ,",
    "we present representative calculations for the target nuclei @xmath42o , @xmath43ca , and @xmath44zr . additional cases ( @xmath45c , @xmath46ca , @xmath47pb ) give similar results .",
    "for the @xmath44zr case , we considered transfer reactions with @xmath48 = 11 mev  @xcite .",
    "we calculated cross sections for transfers to the @xmath49 ground state , the @xmath50 first excited state , and to a narrow @xmath51 resonance state that lies about 1 mev above the neutron separation threshold of 7.195 mev . for @xmath43ca",
    ", we studied three different beam energies , @xmath48 = 13 , 19.3 , and 56 mev  @xcite , and considered reactions involving both the @xmath52 ground and first excited @xmath53 state in @xmath54ca .",
    "the @xmath42o(d , p ) reaction was recently studied in inverse kinematics , at equivalent deuteron energy @xmath48 = 21 mev .",
    "measurements were carried out for transfers to two bound states ( @xmath49 ground state and @xmath50 first excited state ) and two resonance states ( a @xmath55 resonance at @xmath56 = 4.77 mev and a resonance at @xmath56 = 6.17 mev , which has either @xmath55 or @xmath57 character . ) we carried out calculations for the two bound states and the two resonances , considering both spin - parity assignments for the second resonance .",
    "finite - range dwba calculations were carried out with a modified version of the reaction code fresco  @xcite that allowed setting specific contributions to the transition matrix element to zero .",
    "the reid soft - core potential  @xcite was used to describe the deuteron .",
    "we used the deuteron - nucleus optical - model potential by daehnick  @xcite and employed the koning - delaroche potential  @xcite for the proton - nucleus interaction .",
    "the manner in which we calculated the surface term , as a difference between prior - interior and post - interior contributions ( eq .  [ eq_intpotosurfpluspri ] ) , requires good post - prior agreement .",
    "we therefore matched the approximation used by the fresco code , specifically the omission of the spin - orbit term in @xmath20 and @xmath17 in the transition operators ( eqs .",
    "[ eq_transop_post ] and [ eq_transop_prior ] ) , by eliminating this term also from the optical - model potential in the entrance and exit channels .",
    "in order to still carry out comparisons to experimental results , small adjustments to the potential parameters were made to reproduce the elastic scattering cross section , where available , and to improve the fit of the full calculations with measured ( d , p ) cross sections .",
    "we verified that the overall conclusions of our study are not affected by these changes in potential parameters . for final bound states ,",
    "the overlap function was approximated by a single - particle function in a woods - saxon well , with a depth adjusted to reproduce the proper binding energy . for resonance states",
    ", we adopted a bin description for the overlap function .",
    "bin functions are momentum - averaged continuum wave functions",

    "subsequently , we study the separation into three terms , given in eq .",

    "transfer experiments are often carried out under conditions that presumably make the reaction peripheral , _",
    "i.e.  _ they probe the overlap function in the region of the nuclear surface .",
    "the primary contributions to the transfer matrix elements should therefore come from @xmath3 values that are roughly equal to the size of the target nucleus .",
    "our calculations , however , will illustrate that the importance of a particular nuclear region depends on the form ( post or prior ) chosen .",
    "the potential well used for calculating the one - neutron overlap functions of various states in @xmath68zr with the ground state of @xmath44zr had a radius of 5.53 fm and a diffuseness of 0.66 fm ; the rms radius of the overlap associated with the @xmath49 @xmath68zr ground state was 4.94 fm .",

    "as expected , for small separation radii , the exterior terms contain all cross section contributions ( @xmath70 @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) and for very large radii , the interior terms carry the bulk of the cross section ( @xmath73 @xmath71 for @xmath74 ) . in both post and prior cases , contributions to the transition matrix element are very small for radii below 2 fm as well as for radii above 15 fm , as indicated by curves that are largely flat in those regions . the interesting region , however , is where the cross - over from interior - dominated to exterior - dominated occurs . we observe that this cross - over lies at much smaller radii when the prior formulation is used than in the post formulation .    in the post formulation , integration over @xmath3 from 0 out to 7 - 8",
    "fm yields less than 30% of the peak cross section , while in the prior formulation such integration captures over 80% ( see post and prior _ interior _ contributions ) .",

    "this illustrates that , although the full post and prior dwba amplitudes are equal , their behavior is quite different in the subspace over the variable @xmath3 .",

    "we carried out a set of calculations for @xmath44zr(d , p)@xmath68zr that included stripping to the ( bound ) ground and first excited states , as well as to a narrow @xmath51 resonance at about 1 mev above the neutron separation threshold .",

    "at all separation radii for which @xmath30 dominates , there are also remnant contributions from one or both of the other terms , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . as a result , the surface term alone does not completely reproduce the angular behavior of the cross section .",

    "in fact , in the region below 10 degrees , the measured cross section does not exhibit this upturn .",
    "the full calculation is not able to reproduce the experimental data correctly without introducing a ( somewhat artifical ) lower cutoff in the integration .",

    "the calculated cross sections show some dependence on the choice of @xmath0 , and the absence of the other terms is clearly significant .",
    "it is known that with increasing beam energy a reaction becomes less peripheral and is increasingly affected by the structure of the nuclear interior .",

    "the first two cases resemble the zr example discussed , with a dominant surface term around @xmath0 = 6.5 fm and 7.0 fm , respectively , that approximately reproduces the shape of the full cross section but underpredicts the magnitude . for the highest beam energy considered , @xmath48 = 56 mev , however , the surface term peaks at smaller radii , around @xmath0 = 5.25 fm . in this region , there are sizable contributions from the post - interior and the prior - exterior terms .",

    "in both cases , the surface term does not provide a good representation of the reaction for the higher energies , but shows clear improvements as one moves to lower energies , @xmath48 = 19.3 and 13.0 mev : the shape of the calculated cross section becomes less dependent on the choice of of the surface radius @xmath0 and better approximates the exact cross section .               achieving convergence for transfer calculations involving resonances",
    "has long been known to be difficult and we find this again in the calculations presented here .",

    "various methods have been suggested to achieve numerical convergence  @xcite , but their implementation in modern reaction codes is incomplete . here",
    "we investigate to which extent the surface term is able to reproduce the full cross sections for several resonances . a surface term that captures the essentials of the reaction would reduce the dependence of the calculated cross section on slowly - converging radial integrals .",
    "furthermore , it would provide strong motivation for the implementation of the formalism within the framework of the continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) approach , as the prior term is identically zero in that case  @xcite .",

    "this was expected , since these were carried out in the traditional dwba approach that does not make use of any simplifications that the surface approach might offer .",

[ eq : mpost ] ) from far outside the nucleus that have to be taken into account , while contributions from large distances to the prior - form matrix element ( eq .  [ eq : mprior ] ) are suppressed by the transition operator .",

    "the radii are selected to be 0.5 fm smaller than in the right column . while this shift in @xmath0 reduces the surface - only cross section , it increases the cross section arising from the the exterior - prior term , with the sum giving a much better approximation to the exact cross section . when moving to smaller radii , which improves the agreement of the surface - plus - prior - exterior approximation with the exact result , care",
    "must be taken to remain at a radius @xmath0 for which the nuclear potential @xmath19 can be approximately neglected . in the present case ,",
    "the potential binding the neutron to the @xmath42o target has fallen to 15% of its maximum strength at @xmath0=4.5 fm and to 8% of its strength at @xmath0=5.0 fm .    the exterior term , which involves an integral over @xmath3 from @xmath0 to very large distances , includes contributions from the same operator @xmath18 ( see eq .",

    "the drawback of this latter approach , however , is that it requires a model for the one - nucleon overlap function in the nuclear interior .",
    "it will still be an improvement over the traditional calculations , since i ) the interior contribution , and thus the model - dependence , of the cross section is reduced , and ii ) the dominant part of the cross section can be parameterized in terms of useful spectroscopic quantities .",

    "experimentally , resonance structures are most often studied in elastic and inelastic scattering reactions . in this context , the phenomenological r - matrix approach has been extremely useful for the interpretation of experiments and for extracting resonance energies and widths from measured cross sections  @xcite .    a formalism that makes use of r - matrix ideas and is applicable to ( d , p ) transfer reactions ,",
    "was recently proposed  @xcite with the goal to provide a practical way for extracting structure information from transfer experiments . in this approach ,",

    "we find that the surface term is dominant in the region where one expects it to be strong , near 5 - 7 fm for bound states , and at slightly larger radii for resonance states . at all radii",

    "it is clearly necessary to include additional contributions .",
    "possible remedies include increasing the surface radius , which leads to improved cross sections , at the expense of having a model - dependent contribution from the nuclear interior ( albeit one that is smaller than the model dependence in traditional calculations ) .",
    "alternatively , one can decrease the chosen surface radius . in the dwba implementation of the method , this will require the explicit inclusion of external ( prior ) contributions . in the cdcc extension of the approach",
    ", we expect these external contributions to be partially accounted for by the deuteron breakup components that are included in the cdcc formalism .    if the latter strategy is followed , the surface - integral approach has potentially very significant advantages over conventional calculations : 1 ) it removes the dependence of the cross section calculations on the model used for the nuclear interior .",
