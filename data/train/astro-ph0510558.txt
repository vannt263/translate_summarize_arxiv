    "the term supershell was observationally defined by @xcite where eleven hi objects were examined .",
    "the supershells have been observed as expanding shells , or holes , in the hi - column density distribution of our galaxy , in the magellanic clouds , in the dwarf irregular galaxy ho - ii  @xcite , and in the nearby dwarf galaxy ic 2574  @xcite .",
    "the dimensions of these objects span from 100   to 1700   and often present elliptical shapes or elongated features , which are difficult to explain based on an expansion in a uniform medium .",
    "these structures are commonly explained through introducing theoretical objects named bubble or superbubble ; these are created by mechanical energy input from stars ( see for example  @xcite ; @xcite ) . thus , the origin of a supershell is not necessarily a superbubble , and other possible origins include collisions of high - velocity clouds ( see for example  @xcite ; @xcite  ) .",
    "the worm is another observed feature that may , or may not , be associated with a wall of a superbubble .",
    "galactic worms were first identified as irregular , vertical columns of atomic gas stretching from the galactic plane ; now , similar structures are found in radio continuum and infrared maps ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the models that explain supershells as being due to the combined explosions of supernova in a cluster of massive stars are now briefly reviewed .",
    "semi - analytical and hydrodynamical calculations are generally adopted . in semi - analytical calculations",
    "the thin - shell approximation can be the key to obtaining the expansion of the superbubble ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the thin - shell approximation has already been used in a variety of different problems , and with both analytical and numerical approaches ( aside from the review by @xcite , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus the validity and limitations of the method are well known .",
    "for instance , modelling is fast and simple because only shell dynamics are included in an approximate way , while fluid variables are not included at all .",
    "the price that one has to pay is a lack of knowledge of the density and velocity profiles and , obviously , the onset and development of turbulence , instabilities or mixing can not be followed .",
    "these facts limit the applications of this method to derive only general shapes , approximate expansion rates , and gross features of the surface mass - density distributions of the shells .",
    "a detailed comparison with the results of so - called thin - layer approximation , as described for example in @xcite is now being carried out .",
    "* the two main assumptions , which are ( i ) all swept - up gas accumulates infinitely in a thin shell just after the shock front and ( ii ) the gas pressure is uniform inside the cavity , are in common with the two models . *",
    "the numerical equations of motion are different . for examples  ( [ eq_momentum ] ) and ( [ eqn : dpdt ] )",
    "are for during the bursting phase , and silich s set from ( 5 ) to ( 9 ) is for the three cartesian coordinates . * in our model",
    "the shear due to galactic rotation is neglected in a first approximation .",
    "see subsubsection  [ galrot ] for a late addition on shear .",
    "* our treatment includes the concept of efficiency of the simulation , equation ( [ eq : reliability ] ) , which is neglected by silich .",
    "another source of comparison can be made with the 3d models of  @xcite , in which a number of processes not considered here are now included :    * two mechanisms of mass injection into the cavity are adopted : thermal evaporation of both the cold expanding shell , and the clouds engulfed by the shell , and dynamic disruption of clouds penetrating into the bubble interior . * a power - law density and temperature distribution inside the superbubble during the entire evolution . * a cooling function that takes into account the metallicity gradients in the galaxy .",
    "however the astrophysical results of  @xcite are basically similar to ours , and the maximum elongation of the superbubbles along the z - direction can reach 2  kpc in both models .",
    "similar results are also obtained concerning the morphologies : in both models the hourglass - shape is obtained when equality between the bursting time and the elapsed time is assumed .",
    "the vertical walls considered here are the belt of subsection 4.2 of  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical approximation was used by @xcite . as for the effect of magnetic fields ,",
    "a semi - analytical method was introduced by  @xcite and a magneto - hydrodynamic code has been adopted by various authors @xcite .    the plane of the numerical analysis is now outlined .",
    "a numerical code that solves the momentum equation coupled with the variation of pressure in the presence of the injection of mechanical luminosity and adiabatic losses was developed in section  [ code ] ; testing with numerical hydro - dynamic calculation was developed in subsubsection  [ sec : hydro ] .",
    "the analytical `` expansion law '' of the superbubbles can be set up both in the bursting phase ( see section  [ approximation ] ) and in the adiabatic phase after the sn burst stops , ( see subsection  [ approximation2 ] ) .",
    "the various types of obtained shape ( elliptical , egg , v , vertical and hourglass ) are described in subsection  [ shapes ] .",
    "a numerical law that describes the raising of the vertical walls is deduced in subsubsection  [ verticalwalls ] .",
    "the map of the expanding superbubble s velocity can be tentatively traced by generating random points on the expansion surface ( see subsection  [ ref_velocity ] ) .",
    "the developed theory was then applied to the supershells associated with gw  46.4 + 5   and gsh-238 ( see subsection  [ sec464 ] and subsection  [ sec238 ] , respectively ) .",
    "the hi structure in the galactic plane can be tentatively simulated by using the percolation framework to trace the spiral - arm structure ( see section  [ percolation ] and appendix  [ spiral ] ) .    by adopting the framework of radiation coming from the layer comprised between two shells",
    ", we can deduce the center darkening law ( see appendix  [ sec_ring ] ) .",

    "it is clear that an upper limit should be inserted into the basic equation  ( [ eq : pressure ] ) ; this is the time after which the bursting phenomena stops , @xmath25 .    since there is the @xmath26 term in the the first theorem of thermodynamics ( @xmath27 ) , the total thermal energy decreases with time . the pressure of the internal gas decreases according to the adiabatic law , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the equation for the conservation of momentum becomes @xmath30 it is important to remember that this phase occurs after the sn burst stops .",
