    "high redshift ( @xmath2 ) qsos , especially radio - quiet objects , are rare in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , voges _",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "a comparison of the radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos detected in the rass indicated that the x - ray detection rate of radio - quiet qsos drops much faster towards higher redshift than that of radio - loud qsos ( yuan _ et al .",
    "the catalogue of yuan _",
    "( 1998 ) ( see table 1 in that paper ) contains 18 radio - quiet qsos with @xmath3 detected in the rass . in the northern sky with galactic latitude @xmath4 , only 20 qsos with @xmath5 and four qsos with @xmath6",
    "have been known in the literature so far .    at high redshifts the rest frame energy range",
    "is shifted to higher energies , e.g. , for @xmath7 the rosat / pspc ( sensitive between 0.1 and 2.4kev ) receives photons emitted between 0.35 and 8.4kev . only upper limits exist for radio - quiet qsos above 100kev whereas several radio - loud objects with blazar properties have been detected above 100 kev ( e.g. von montigny",
    "_ et al . _",
    "1995 ) . from several high redshift qsos",
    "low energy cut - offs have been found , which are interpreted as due to the strong low energy absorption probably caused by the material near the qso itself ( elvis _ et al .",
    "higher resolution spectroscopy with future x - ray telescopes , e.g. , axaf , xmm , and astro - e , will be able to quantify the contribution of metals to this proposed strong absorption .",
    "low energy cut - offs have mainly been discovered in radio - loud objects , only some tentative evidence for low energy cutoffs are known in several radio - quiet qsos . however ,",
    "the statistics above @xmath8 is poor ; only three radio - quiet objects are included in a previous study ( fiore _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , high redshift qsos found in the rass belong to the most luminous members of this class , making the upper end of the luminosity function .",
    "it is known from the magnification bias ( borgeest _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) that such objects have high probability to be gravitationally magnified .",
    "this is particularly true for radio - quiet objects , which seem to be the more common but intrinsically x - ray faint population . among the radio - quiet @xmath3 qsos in the rass ,",
    "two are known gravitationally lensed objects .",
    "he11041805 ( @xmath9 ) is a double qso detected in hamburg ( wisotzki _ et al .",
    "the other object is rxj0911.4 + 0551 ( @xmath10 , bade _",
    "1997 ) , a gravitationally lensed system with at least four qso images .    the full sky coverage and the sensitivity of the rass make it the most appropriate for finding these rare objects .",
    "radio - loud qsos have been selected mainly during the identifications of bright radio sources .",
    "projects which may be able to select radio - quiet qsos down to @xmath11 on large sky areas are under way ( e.g. sdss , see kent 1994 ; hamburg / eso survey , see wisotzki _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) ; but up to now results are only available for comparatively small and patchy areas of the sky",
    ". therefore studies using correlations between existing agn catalogues and the rass to determine the relation between radio bright and quiet qsos in the x - rays are probably affected by selection effects .    in order to enlarge the current sample of x - ray luminous radio - quiet high redshift qsos",
    ", we start this survey project to select this kind of qsos in the rass using optical observations",
    ". our study will also verify whether some selection effects are serious in the above mentioned correlation studies .",
    "we used the digitized objective prism spectra from the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs , hagen _",
    "1995 ) for the selection of qsos with high redshifts",
    ". currently the hamburg identification project of rass sources ( bade _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) covers about 10,200deg@xmath12 of the northern high galactic latitude sky ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this survey uses photo plates which are sensitive between 5400  and the atmospheric limit at @xmath14 .",
    "thus the ly-@xmath15 line can be detected between @xmath16 .",
    "if the civ1549 emission line is discernible in the objective prism spectrum , too , the reliability of the classification is very high ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "if only one strong emission line is visible , other strong emission lines can be source of the line ( e.g .. ciii 1909 , mgii 2798 , [ oiii]5007 ) and smaller redshifts are possible .",
    "follow - up observations of the qso candidates are thus necessary .    the classification of agn candidates in the hamburg identification project of rass sources is based mainly on their blue continuum which can be well described by a power law . for the selection of qsos with higher redshifts we inspected the objective prism spectra by eye , looking for strong emission lines .",
    "if the magnitude of the agn candidate is near the plate limit , it is difficult to distinguish emission lines from noise .",
    "another problem for number counts is the varying detection limit of the objective prism plates . taking all effects into account",
    ", @xmath18 is a good approximation of the detection limit for strong emission lines . following these procedures we finally selected 22 qso candidates in the northern sky with galactic latitude @xmath19 .    in the 1st to 7th columns of table 1 , we list their rosat names , coordinates of the x - ray sources and their optical counterparts , offsets between the x - ray and optical positions , x - ray fluxes , b - band magnitudes and 1.4ghz radio fluxes from nvss ( condon _ et al .",
    "the x - ray fluxes between 0.1 and 2.4kev are calculated by assuming a power law with photon index @xmath20 and only galactic neutral hydrogen absorption .",
    "the follow - up observations were split into two observing campaigns in the spring of 1998 when the area of 300 hqs plates covering 6500@xmath21 was observable . because varying + weather conditions prevented us from observing the high redshift qso candidates uniformly",
    ", the surveyed area is only a rough estimate .",
    "we have performed the spectroscopic observations on the 22 selected high redshift qso candidates using the 2.16 m telescope at xinglong station of beijing astronomical observatory . the exposure time varied from 10 to 70 minutes for each object depending on weather conditions and object brightness .",
    "the spectra of these high redshift qso candidates were obtained after the standard sky subtraction and relative flux calibration using the midas software package developed at the european southern observatory ( banse _ et al .",
    ". the observation dates , exposure times , types and redshifts of these high redshift candidates are given in the 8th to 11th columns of table 1 .",
    "the 12th column gives the rest frame luminosity @xmath22 between @xmath23 .",
    "for the determination of the luminosity @xmath24 and @xmath25 are assumed .",
    "1.32 mm    [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,<,>,^,>,<,^ , < \" , ]      + notes : @xmath26 @xmath27 is in unit of @xmath28 ; @xmath29 l@xmath30 is the luminosity between @xmath23 in units of @xmath31 ; @xmath32 a radio detected object but is formally radio quiet +    -.2 cm    -3.5 cm -1.5 cm    ' '' ''    -11 cm    -2.5 cm",
    "-1.8 cm    ' '' ''    -4.0 cm    table 1 shows that seven objects are qsos with redshift larger than 1 , and four of them have redshift larger than 2 .",
    "12 candidates are qsos with redshifts between 0.3 and 1 .",
    "three candidates are low redshift seyfert galaxies .",
    "if the strongest emission line in the objective prism spectrum is @xmath33 , redshift of the object is larger than 2 .",
    "if the strongest line is civ or mgii in the prism spectrum , the redshift is larger than 1 or between 0.3 and 1 , respectively .",
    "however , in several cases the emission line in the prism spectrum is produced by a strong forbidden emission line of seyfert galaxies , such as [ oii ] or [ nev ] .",
    "this is the reason why we also identified three seyfert galaxies .",
    "we checked the radio fluxes of our high redshift candidates with three main radio catalogues , namely gb 5ghz catalogue ( gregory _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , nvss 1.4ghz catalogue ( condon _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and first 1.4ghz catalogue ( white _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . according to the definition of radio - loud agns , namely @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the ratio of 5ghz radio flux and the b - band optical flux ( kellermann _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , we found that eight objects in our sample are radio - loud ( see table 1 ) . among them",
    "six objects are weak radio sources and only two new quasars have strong radio emission .",
    "rx j1616.9 + 3621 with @xmath36 , was found to be positionally coincident with a radio - loud object first j161655.5 + 362134 .",
    "another new qso , rx j1604.6 + 5714 with @xmath37 , is coincident with 87 gb 160335.3 + 572233 .",
    "one weak radio source ( rx j1259.8 + 3423 ) , which does not match the definition of radio - loud agns , and other 13 sources with no previous radio detection are most probably radio - quiet objects .",
    "table 1 shows that five new qsos have @xmath38 + @xmath39 , and all of them are radio - quiet qsos with @xmath40 .",
    "another radio - quiet qso with @xmath40 , rx j1541.2 + 7126 , also has @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , these six new radio - quiet qsos are really x - ray luminous objects . in figure 1 and 2",
    ", we give the finding charts and spectra of these six new qsos .",
    "the finding charts were extracted from the palomar ( poss - i ) digitized sky - survey .",
    "table 1 lists 18 sources having offsets less than @xmath42 between x - ray and optical positions .",
    "they are all the most nearby optical sources to the x - ray positions , so that we suggest that they are the most likely true identifications of the x - ray sources .",
    "four candidates have x - ray to optical offsets larger than @xmath42 , which are not uncommon for rosat detection at the detection limit . here",
    "we discuss briefly each of these cases . for _",
    "rx j0959.8 + 0049 _ , the optical counterpart we selected is @xmath43 away from the x - ray position and is identified as a quasar with @xmath44 .",
    "three other optical sources ( fainter than @xmath45 ) are found to be closer to the x - ray position , but all of them are red objects with @xmath46 .",
    "although such colors are compatible with a m - type dwarf , the optical weakness makes this identification unplausible .",
    "therefore , our identification of this x - ray source with a @xmath44 qso is highly likely , though a future high resolution x - ray image of this source is required to confirm this identification . for _",
    "rx j1208.3 + 5240 _ , it is identified with a qso with @xmath47 , which is @xmath48 away from the x - ray position .",
    "another nearby optical source is fainter than our candidate and is @xmath49 far away from the x - ray source .",
    "thus we regard our identification is most likely correct . for _",
    "rx j1428.9 + 2710 _ , its x - ray position is @xmath50 away from a qso with @xmath51 .",
    "we note that another optical source , is only @xmath52 away from the x - ray position .",
    "this source , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , is fainter than our candidate qso and is also point - like .",
    "again future high quality x - ray observations are needed to confirm our identification . finally for _",
    "rx j1701.4 + 3511 _ , the optical source we selected is @xmath55 away from the x - ray position and was found to be a new qso with @xmath56 .",
    "other four nearby optical sources , with angular distances from @xmath57 to @xmath58 to the x - ray position , are faint and red objects with @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we believe that our identification is reliable .",
    "-0.2 cm      among the new radio - quiet qsos discovered by us , six have redshifts larger than 1.3 and three of them have redshifts larger than 2 .",
    "these identifications substantially increase the number of such objects detected in the rass . in the sky area of high galactic latitudes ( @xmath60 )",
    ", we have made a correlation between the catalogue of identifications of rass sources from the hqs schmidt plates and the catalogue of qsos and agns ( vron - cetty & vron 1996 ) .",
    "this area contains only 18 previously known qsos with 5ghz radio fluxes less than 20mjy and redshifts larger than 1.3 , and only four of them have redshifts larger than 2 .",
    "these four qsos are rx j09190 + 3502 , kuv 12461 + 2710 , pg 1247 + 268 and wee 83 . the qso identified with rx j09190 + 3502 was discovered at hamburg ( bade _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , but a confident identification was not made previously because an agn with low redshift was detected closer to the x - ray position .",
    "wee 83 was selected by weedman ( 1985 ) on objective prism plates , because it showed a strong emission line , which was regarded as @xmath61 . in figure 3",
    "we show the slit spectrum of wee 83 which we took in february 1998 .",
    "clearly we can see at least four emission lines and the average redshift of this object is 0.311 rather than 2.04 .",
    "therefore , actually only two x - ray luminous and radio - quiet qsos with @xmath62 in the sky area of @xmath19 were known previously . in figure 4",
    "we show the redshift distributions of the previously known radio - loud and radio - quiet agns in the area with @xmath19 , and the redshift distribution of the new radio - quiet agns in our sample .",
    "it is clear that the radio - quiet qsos are more numerous than the radio - loud qsos at lower redshift ( @xmath63 ) ; most of the qsos with higher redshift have high radio fluxes , and radio - quiet qsos with higher redshifts are relatively rare .",
    "the new qsos discovered by us represent a substantial contribution to the number of radio - quiet , x - ray luminous qsos with @xmath64 .",
    "a histogram of the ratio between the 1.4 ghz radio flux density and the 1 kev x - ray flux density for the high redshift qsos in our survey area is given in figure 5 .",
    "it includes 22 radio - loud qsos and 9 radio - quiet qsos with @xmath64 ( an upper limit of 2.5mjy was adopted for the sources with no radio detection in the nvss catalogue ) .",
    "it demonstrates again that the radio - loud objects with high redshift are more numerous than the radio - quiet objects in the rass , however the amount of radio - quiet high redshift qsos was obviously underestimated in earlier studies .",
    "this histogram shows clearly that the radio - loud qsos and radio - quiet qsos are well separated and there is a strong distinction between these two populations of x - ray loud qsos ; it is clear from figure 5 that all radio - loud high redshift qsos have @xmath1 larger than @xmath65 while all radio - quiet qsos have @xmath1 less than @xmath65 .",
    "they seem to support the suggestion that radio - loud qsos and radio - quiet qsos may have different physical properties .",
    "this has already been shown and discussed in earlier papers .",
    "for example , the differences of the x - ray color and the x - ray spectra of radio - quiet qsos and radio - loud qsos at high redshift have been found by bechtold _",
    "( 1994 ) , and these differences may imply that the central engine and the environment of these two kinds of qsos are probably different . it has also been found that the x - ray spectra of the radio loud high redshift qsos are significantly harder compared to the radio quiet population ( schartel _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; brinkmann , yuan & siebert 1997 ) .",
    "it is thus possible that an additional spectral component is necessary in order to explain the observations .",
    "such a component may be contributed by the beamed radiation from a highly relativistic plasma jet aligned nearly to our direction ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; kollgaard 1994 ) .      for high redshift qsos ,",
    "the spectral region of the soft x - ray excess found with rosat is shifted partially out of the observable window and with the spectral resolution of rosat it is difficult to distinguish the soft excess and the power law component .",
    "however , a strong soft x - ray excess with an extension to higher energies is probably responsible for the high x - ray fluxes of the radio - quiet high redshift qsos .",
    "the origin of the soft x - ray excess is extensively discussed in the literature , but no firm conclusion can be drawn currently ( piro , matt & ricci 1997 ) .",
    "many authors have proposed the inner regions of the accretion disk as emission region ( e.g. arnaud _ et al . _ 1985 ; saxton _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; brunner _ et al .",
    "spectroscopic asca observations have shown that narrow - line seyfert 1 s and low redshift radio - quiet qsos have generally steeper intrinsic hard x - ray continua ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ; reeves _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . but whether the x - ray luminous , radio - quiet high redshift qsos have similar x - ray spectral properties as narrow line seyfert 1 s ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) and low redshift radio - quiet qsos is still unclear ( see vignali",
    "_ et al . _",
    "we expect that the future broad band spectroscopic observations on these qsos using xmm and axaf will lead to significant progress in understanding the x - ray emission mechanism of them .",
    "we thank weimin yuan for reading the manuscript critically and the referee , wolfgang brinkmann , for helpful comments .",
    "wu acknowledges the support from the director funds of beijing astronomical observatory .",
