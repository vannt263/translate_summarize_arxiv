    "in this paper , the idea of an independent test of the applicability of a statistical model for the description of the soft part of particle production in a heavy - ion collision postulated in @xcite , is developed for the much more realistic case of a hadron gas and its expansion .",
    "so far , the statistical model has been applied successfully in description of particle yield ratios and @xmath2 spectra measured in heavy - ion collisions @xcite ( there are also computation packages for thermal studies available from the web @xcite ) .",
    "now , the freeze - out parameters obtained from those analyses will be used to evaluate global observables : the transverse energy density @xmath5 , the charged particle multiplicity density @xmath6 and their ratio .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is based on the fact that transverse energy measurements are independent of hadron spectroscopy ( in particular , no particle identification is necessary ) , therefore they could be used as an additional test of the self - consistency of a statistical model .",
    "the same holds true for the charged particle multiplicity , which actually is the charged _ hadron _ multiplicity , according to the experimental definition given in @xcite .",
    "the experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the polar angle , @xmath9 denotes @xmath10 ( @xmath11 means the nucleon mass ) for baryons and the total energy @xmath12 for all other particles , and the sum is taken over all @xmath13 emitted particles @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the case of rhic at @xmath1 gev , @xmath14 is taken instead of @xmath12 for antibaryons @xcite",
    ".    the statistical model with single freeze - out is used ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the model reproduces very well ratios and @xmath2 spectra of particles measured at rhic @xcite .",
    "the main assumption of the model is the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and thermal freeze - outs , which is important if @xmath2 spectra are considered ( this enables to neglect the possible elastic interactions after the chemical freeze - out ) . since in the present paper the integrated quantities over @xmath2 are dealt with , the above - mentioned assumption should not be so important for final results .",
    "the actually detected ( stable ) particles have two sources : ( _ a _ ) a thermal gas and ( _ b _ ) secondaries produced by decays and sequential decays of primordial resonances .",
    "all stable hadrons and confirmed resonances up to a mass of @xmath15 gev from the particle data tables @xcite are constituents of the gas .",
    "the distributions of particles from source ( _ a _ ) are given by a bose - einstein or a fermi - dirac distribution at the freeze - out .",
    "the distributions of secondaries ( source ( _ b _ ) ) can be obtained from the elementary kinematics of a many - body decay or from the superposition of two or more such decays ( for details see the appendix and @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "all possible ( 2- , 3- and 4-body ) decays with branching ratios not less than @xmath16 are considered .",
    "also almost all possible sequential decays are taken into account , namely : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where 2 , 3 and 4 mean the 2- , 3- and 4-body decay respectively , and a cascade proceeds from the right to the left ( as in the usual mathematical definition of the superposition of functions ) .",
    "it should be stressed that all contributions from weak decays are included .",
    "the contribution to the transverse energy from the omitted cascades has been estimated at @xmath28 .",
    "but since the most of these cascades ends with two photons , they do not contribute to the charged particle multiplicity at all .",
    "the following are the foundations of the model .",
    "a noninteracting gas of stable hadrons and resonances at chemical and thermal equilibrium is created at the central rapidity region ( crr ) of a collision .",
    "the gas cools and expands , and after reaching the freeze - out point it ceases .",
    "the conditions for the freeze - out are expressed by values of two independent thermal parameters : the temperature @xmath29 and the baryon number chemical potential @xmath30 .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath31 is determined from the requirement that the overall strangeness of the gas equals zero .",
    "a freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the condition    @xmath32    which means that the freeze - out takes place at a fixed moment of the invariant time @xmath33 .",
    "additionally , it is assumed that the four - velocity of an element of the freeze - out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate ,    @xmath34    then the following parameterization of the hypersurface is chosen :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the rapidity of the element , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 determines the transverse radius    @xmath39    to keep the transverse size finite , @xmath40 is restricted by the condition @xmath41 . in this way one has two additional parameters of the model , @xmath33 and @xmath42 , connected with the geometry of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "also the transverse velocity , @xmath43 , can be obtained    @xmath44    which is the value of the transverse velocity @xmath45 from the central slice after boosting it in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the transverse velocity can be expressed as a function of the transverse radius    @xmath46    since it is an increasing function of @xmath40 , the maximum value of @xmath45 called the maximum transverse - flow parameter ( or the surface velocity ) , is given by    @xmath47    so it depends only on the ratio @xmath48 .",
    "according to the general description founded in @xcite and developed in @xcite for the case with decays taken into account , the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species @xmath49 has the form    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the normal vector on a freeze - out hypersurface , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the four - velocity of a fluid element and @xmath54 is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question .",
    "the final distribution means here that @xmath54 is the sum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution ( for details see @xcite ) . for the hypersurface and expansion described in sect .",
    "[ foundat ] , eq .",
    "( [ cooper ] ) takes the following form :    @xmath55    where    @xmath56    note that the distribution expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ cooper2 ] ) and ( [ peu ] ) is explicitly boost invariant ( in fact , it is constant with respect to rapidity ) .",
    "the rapidity density of particle species @xmath49 is given by    @xmath57    whereas the corresponding pseudorapidity density reads    @xmath58    analogously , the transverse energy pseudorapidity density for the same species can be written as    @xmath59    for the quantities at midrapidity one has    @xmath60    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the velocity of the center of mass of two colliding nuclei with respect to the laboratory frame ( only for rhic @xmath63 ) . for rhic at @xmath1 gev the case @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ etdenmid ] ) is replaced by    @xmath65    now , the overall charged particle and transverse energy densities can be obtained    @xmath66    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) denote sets of species of finally detected particles . in the view of the definition given in @xcite and the detailed description of the experimental setup and the analysis procedure from @xcite , the set of charged particles @xmath69 can consist of stable hadrons only , @xmath71 , whereas @xmath68 also includes photons , @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "to check the self - consistency of the described model , rapidity densities of pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons have been calculated for the @xmath74 most central au - au collisions at @xmath75 gev at rhic .",
    "the supplied values of the thermal and geometric parameters are in this case @xmath76 mev , @xmath77 mev , @xmath78 fm and @xmath79 fm @xcite .",
    "the geometric parameters were obtained from the fit to the @xmath2 spectra of the above - mentioned particles @xcite .",
    "the integrated yields over @xmath2 are also given in @xcite , so the comparison with the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ parapdens ] ) can be done easily .",
    "the results are presented in table[table1 ] .",
    "note that the very good agreement has been found .",
    "the presentation of the main results of the paper needs a few comments concerning the ags case . in the all",
    "cited papers the same method of establishing the thermal parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 is applied .",
    "the method is based on the best fit of calculated particle density ratios to the relative particle abundance data .",
    "but the different model of the freeze - out was applied for the description of @xmath2 spectra measured at ags @xcite . in that model ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) , the freeze - out happens instantaneously in the @xmath40 direction , _",
    "i.e. _ at a constant value of @xmath80 ( _ not _ at a constant value of @xmath33 as here ) .",
    "the shape of a hypersurface in the longitudinal direction is not determined explicitly , but due to the factorization of the transverse mass spectrum it can affect only the normalization .",
    "the parameters connected with the expansion are the surface velocity @xmath81 and @xmath42 .",
    "the transverse velocity profile has the following form    @xmath82    with the choice @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the implementation of values of @xmath81 obtained within that model into the presented one is entirely _ ad hoc _ , nevertheless it works surprisingly well",
    ". of course , one directly could apply the description of the transverse flow from @xcite to calculate the transverse energy and charged particle densities , but it is much more tempting and elegant to work within one model .",
    "additionally , there is one technical problem connected with the treatment of resonance decays . here , the very convenient form of the invariant distribution , eq .",
    "( [ cooper ] ) , has been derived because the normal vector is proportional to the four - velocity , @xmath84 .",
    "this is not the case for the hypersurface chosen in @xcite , so the calculation of resonance decay contributions would be much more complex ( for the exact formulae , see @xcite ) .",
    "note also that in the view of @xcite , particle distributions depend very weakly on the exact form of the velocity profile ( _ i.e. _ for considered @xmath85 and @xmath15 ) in the model described in @xcite .",
    "it can be checked that profile ( [ betprof1 ] ) lies in between two profiles of the form ( [ betprof2 ] ) with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    ".[table1 ] comparison of the statistical model estimates of the rapidity densities of charged particles with the experimental values for the @xmath74 most central collisions at @xmath75 gev at rhic @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the first is governed mainly by the temperature and the second by the maximum transverse - flow parameter @xmath81 . for a given temperature",
    ", the increase of @xmath81 should cause the weighting of the expansion contribution .",
    "but for a constant value of @xmath81 , the strengthening of this contribution can be maintained by the lowering of the temperature .",
    "this is why for almost the same @xmath81 ( see the first column of table[table2 ] ) the relative growth of the transverse energy per charged particle , after switching the expansion on , is much greater for ags au - au collisions than for rhic ones . on the other hand , for comparable temperatures",
    ", the expansion contributes to the transverse energy per charged particle much stronger for sps than for rhic ( the former has substantially greater @xmath81 ) .",
    "the expanding thermal hadron gas model has been used to reproduce transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity pseudorapidity densities and their ratio measured at ags , sps and rhic .",
    "the importance of the present analysis originates from the fact that the transverse energy and the charged particle multiplicity are _ independent observables _ , so they can be used as new tools to verify the consistency of predictions of a statistical model for all colliders simultaneously .",
    "the predictions have been made at the previous estimates of thermal and geometric freeze - out parameters obtained from analyses of measured particle ratios and @xmath2 spectra at ags @xcite , sps @xcite and rhic @xcite .",
    "the overall good agreement , not only of the ratio but also absolute values of @xmath88 and @xmath4 , with the data has been achieved . and the observed discrepancies can be explained reasonably .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that the thermal expanding source is responsible for the soft part of the particle production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "moreover , the description of various observables is consistent within one statistical model .",
    "in fact , there are additional arguments which make the above statement even more valuable . in principle",
    ", one could think at first glance that this analysis is nothing more like a kind of an internal consistency check of various measurements . and",
    "such a check could be done even in an model - independent way simply by integrating spectra of stable particles ( the first time with the expression for transverse energy to obtain @xmath88 and the second time without , to receive @xmath4 ) and then adding them all .",
    "but there are two reasons that this can not be done without any external input .",
    "first , transverse momentum spectra are measured in _ limited ranges _ , so very important low-@xmath2 regions are not covered by the data .",
    "for instance at rhic , the first point for pions is at @xmath89 gev / c , for kaons at @xmath90 gev / c and for protons and antiprotons at @xmath91 gev / c @xcite .",
    "there are also upper limits , but contributions from ranges above them are suppressed strongly in comparison with the low-@xmath2 regions .",
    "therefore , to obtain integrated yields some extrapolations below and above the measured ranges are used .",
    "usually two functions are used for each species and the contributed value is the average of their integrals .",
    "in fact these extrapolations are only analytical fits without any physical reasoning , but , for instance , contributions from regions covered by them account for @xmath92 of the yield for pions , @xmath93 for kaons and @xmath94 for protons and antiprotons for rhic at @xmath75 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a calorimeter acts very effectively for these species in the low-@xmath2 range , namely pions with @xmath95 gev / c , kaons with @xmath96 gev / c and protons and antiprotons with @xmath97 gev / c deposit all their kinetic energy @xcite . since the very accurate predictions for the transverse energy density at midrapidity have been obtained ( see table[table2 ] ) , the present analysis can be understood as an undirect proof that in these unmeasurable @xmath2 regions spectra are also explicable by means of the thermal source with flow and decays .",
    "second , it is impossible to check the consistency of the transverse energy data because not all stable hadron spectra are measured at midrapidity for each collision case .",
    "this mainly concerns neutrons and @xmath98 .",
    "the lacking contribution from hadron decay photons could be approximated to some extent with the use of @xmath99 and @xmath100 spectra , but they are also limited in ranges . and",
    "again , the very good agreement of model estimates of the transverse energy density at midrapidity with the data can be interpreted as the strong argument that the production of neutral stable particles can be described in terms of the expanding thermal source with superimposed decays .    and",
    "last but not least , in opposite to the transverse energy , there is some inconsistency ( of the order of @xmath101 ) of the independent measurements of charged particle multiplicities with the corresponding sums of integrated charged particle yields at rhic ( see sect .",
    "[ finl ] ) .",
    "however , only for the case of @xmath1 gev the substantial gap ( of the order of @xmath102 with respect to the direct measurement ) between error bars of these two differently obtained values of @xmath4 exists . for the case of",
    "@xmath75 gev the error bars overlap almost one half of each other .",
    "but since the data at @xmath1 gev are still preliminary , it is difficult to judge whether this inconsistency has the physical or experimental ( an additional systematic error ? ) reason .",
    "the role of expansion is substantial .",
    "it produces about @xmath103 of the transverse energy per charged particle .",
    "but , as can be seen from table[table5 ] , the expansion is not necessary to explain the experimental data for @xmath104 .",
    "the results suggest that the most of the transverse energy per charged particle is produced by the thermal movement .",
    "for sure , the expansion is necessary to explain the absolute values of @xmath88 and @xmath4 . to obtain these one needs a volume of a place of `` action '' and the most adequate way to do it is to parameterize the evolution of the system in space and time , that is to put the expansion in .    as the last comment",
    ", it should be stressed that the results of the present paper have been obtained within the model where the chemical freeze - out happens simultaneously with the thermal one .",
    "however , so far the most extensively studied scenario is that where the thermal freeze - out occurs later then the chemical freeze - out ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this problem has not been addressed here .",
    "but one should notice that the distinction between these two freeze - outs means the introduction of the next parameter ( the fifth here ) into the model .",
    "of course , an extra parameter in a phenomenological model always causes ( or at least should cause ) better agreement with the data . at the present level of investigations both spectra ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) and global observables @xmath88 and",
    "@xmath4 ( this analysis ) are predicted accurately with the assumption of the one freeze - out .",
    "however , more detailed studies should be performed to check whether the transverse energy per charged particle measurement could help somehow in distinction or not between these two freeze - outs and this will be the subject of further investigations .",
