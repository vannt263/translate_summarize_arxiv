    "galaxy mergers and interactions are believed to have a profound impact on the structural evolution and star formation activity of galaxies .",
    "the recent advent of large space - based surveys with thousands of galaxies , such as gems , goods , cosmos , and aegis , has led to the use of different methods for identifying interacting / merging galaxies , such as detailed visual classification , and quantitative codes like cas ( conselice et al . 2000 ) . however , detailed assessment of the results from different methods has been altogether lacking .",
    "we quantify the concentration , asymmetry , and high - spatial frequency clumpiness of the sample galaxies using the cas concentration ( @xmath4 ) ( bershady et al .",
    "2000 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath5 ) and clumpiness ( @xmath6 ) indices ( conselice et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the concentration index ( @xmath4 ) is the ratio of the two radii containing @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the total flux , which is then normalized logarithmically .",
    "the asymmetry index ( @xmath5 ) is found by rotating the original image of the galaxy by 180 degrees , and then subtracting this image from the original .",
    "the residual flux of this subtracted image is then normalized by the original galaxy s flux .",
    "the clumpiness index ( @xmath6 ) is computed by reducing the original galaxy s effective resolution to create a new image that is smoothed so that the high - frequency structure has been washed out .",
    "the original image is then subtracted from the smoothed image to produce a residual map , which then contains only the high frequency part of the original galaxy s light distribution .",
    "the flux of this light is then summed and divided by the sum of the original galaxy s flux to obtain the @xmath6 index .",
    "the cas criteria for identifying distorted / interacting systems ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are empirically derived from nearby galaxies ( conselice et al .",
    "1 .   the cas criteria ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) captures 38% to 58% ( fig .  1 ) of the galaxies visually classified as interacting .",
    "this is not unexpected , given that on average , the @xmath11  0.35 criterion is only satisfied for one third of the major merger timescale in n - body simulations ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "we inspected the morphologically distorted galaxies , which the cas merger criteria fail to capture and find the following .",
    "the criteria do not pick up systems where the externally - triggered tidal features ( e.g. , light bridges between galaxies , tidal tails , arcs , shells , ripples ) and tidal debris ( e.g. , small accreted satellite in the main disk of a galaxy ) , contribute less than @xmath12 of the total light ( e.g. , fig .  3 , cases 1 and 3 ) .",
    "in addition , in galaxies with close double nuclei where the center is assumed to be between the two nuclei , the resulting low @xmath5 value will prevent the system from satisfying the cas criteria ( e.g. , fig .  3 ,",
    "the cas criteria suffer from contamination by relatively undistorted , so - called ` normal ' galaxies .",
    "the contamination rate ( i.e. fraction of ` normal ' galaxies misidentified by cas as distorted / interacting ) increases with redshift ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is due to several factors : 1 .",
    "s ( clumpiness ) and a ( asymmetry ) values are higher in systems with increased star formation .",
    "small - scale asymmetries due to stochastic star formation can be separated from truly interacting systems by visual classification .",
    "however , cas ( designed in rest - frame optical ) may identify high star - forming systems as interacting ( e.g. , fig .  3 , cases 4 and 6 ) at bluer / uv wavelengths as in @xmath13  0.60.8 .",
    "( fig .  1 ) 2 .",
    "galaxies whose outer parts look irregular ( e.g. , fig .  3 ,",
    "cases 7 and 8) , whether intrinsically or due to cosmological surface brightness dimming , can be picked by the cas criteria .",
    "3 .   in systems without a clear center ( e.g. dusty bright galaxies , local and distant irrs , and distant sds that are dimmed to resemble irrs ) the a ( asymmetry ) parameter can be high ( e.g. , fig .  3 cases 4 and 8) .",
    "4 .   in edge - on systems and compact systems ,",
    "where the light profile is steep , small centering inaccuracies can lead to large a ( asymmetry ) values .",
    "( e.g. , fig .  3 case 9 ) 4 .   in jogee , miller , penner , et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we reported the following from visual classification .",
    "the average sfr of strongly disturbed / interacting systems is only modestly enhanced , by a factor of 23 , with respect to normal undisturbed galaxies .",
    "contrary to common lore , large order of magnitude enhancements in the sfr are rare in strongly disturbed systems .",
    "in fact , such systems contribute below @xmath8 of the cosmic sfr density over @xmath13  0.20.8 .",
    "thus , the decline over this regime is driven primarily by a shutdown in the star formation of relatively undisturbed galaxies .",
    "our results are consistent with earlier findings , over a narrower redshfit bin ( @xmath13  0.650.75 ) , that relatively undisturbed galaxies produce most of the uv ( wolf et al .",
    "2005 ) and ir ( bell et al .",
    "2005 ) luminosity density .",
    "a certain element of uncertainty and subjectivity is inherent in visual classification .",
    "however , the robustness of the results can be illustrated by an independent analysis based on the cas system , yielding the same conclusions .",
    "in particular , we show that the cosmic sfr density is dominated by systems classified as ` normal ' by cas , rather than as distorted ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the interpretation here is complicated due to the fact that the cas ` normal ' class includes a small number of distorted galaxies missed by the cas merger criteria , while the cas ` distorted ' class is contaminated by a number of irregular systems .",
    "nonetheless , it is encouraging that the same conclusions are reached with cas .",
