    "effective description of gauge interactions in terms of string has a long history @xcite ( see @xcite for a more recent review ) .",
    "last years the development of the field has streamlined into what is know as ads / cft ( or maldacena ) conjecture @xcite , which claims that superstring theory in the background of ads@xmath1 is essentially the same as @xmath2 super yang  mills ( sym ) model in four  dimensional minkowski space which is the topological boundary of ads@xmath3 .",
    "the assumption is based on the fact that two theories have the same symmetry group whose bosonic part @xmath4 is one one hand the symmetry group of ads@xmath1 space and one the other hand is the conformal group of four  dimensional minkowski space .",
    "( due to vanishing of @xmath5functions @xmath2 sym model is a conformally invariant model . )    identifying irreducible representation of both groups one can put into one - to - one correspondence operators in sym and states in the string theory . in particular , anomalous dimensions of operators in sym theory ( which are eigenvalues of the dilations )",
    "correspond to energy levels in string theory ( see @xcite for a review of ads / cft correspondence ) .",
    "recently much progress was achieved in understanding the scaling properties of sym operators ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "it was found for the scalar sector of sym theory operators that in the planar limit the anomalous dimension matrix can be mapped into the hamiltonian of integrable @xmath6 spin chain @xcite , this result was further generalized to the whole symmetry supergroup @xmath7 in @xcite .",
    "thus , bethe ansatz allows one to find the planar anomalous dimension of any operator in sym without computing explicitly the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "this spin chain is supposed to be a discrete version of the string in ads background .",
    "going beyond the planar limit results in allowing chains to split and join .",
    "( when a fixed number of impurities is considered this dynamics can be described in terms of a quantum mechanical system like one in @xcite . )",
    "the natural task is , then , to extend the spin chain description to the nonplanarity .",
    "indeed , one can do a one - to - one map of sym operators into a system of interacting spins  _ spin bits _ such that the anomalous dimension matrix of sym operators maps to a hamiltonian for this spin system at finite @xmath0 . in this note",
    "we are going to review this model .",
    "interesting reader can find more details in the original paper @xcite .",
    "we consider scalar @xmath8trace operators of the type , @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the lengths of traces and @xmath11 is the total length . the above operators can be equivalently represented in the following form , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an element of the permutation group of @xmath14 and @xmath15 labels the indices @xmath16 . in particular",
    ", the operator corresponds to a permutation with cycles @xmath17 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that to each permutation one can put into correspondence a trace of operators if one specifies the index of each letter .",
    "graphically the field @xmath18 insertion will be represented by a site with two valent lines , like follows :    the incoming arrow connects with the site @xmath19 while the outgoing one goes to @xmath20 . in general , the arrow denote the action of the permutation .",
    "the hamiltonian in the combinatorial form is obtained by computing the action of the operator @xcite @xmath21[\\check{\\phi}_m,\\check{\\phi}_n]:-    \\sfrac{1}{2}:{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}[\\phi_m,\\check{\\phi}_n][\\phi_m,\\check{\\phi}_n]:\\,,\\ ] ] where , @xmath22 and colons denote that derivatives do not act on other fields in the group .",
    "let us compute directly the action of the operator on a state @xmath23 , [ h - state:1 ] h|s;&= & ( ^a_1a_(1)_i_1  ^a_la_(l)_i_l ) .",
    "application of the operator from the second line of yields , [ second - line ] 2^a_ka_(l)(^a_1a_(1)_i_1 ",
    "^a a_(k)_i_k  ^a_la_i_l  ^a_la_(l)_i_l)- + -2^a_ka_(l)(^a_1a_(1)_i_1 ",
    "^a_l a_i_k  ^aa_(k)_i_l  ^a_la_(l)_i_l).this corresponds to graphs with modified cyclic structure : @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively for the first and second line of ( see fig . [ fig : sigma ] .",
    "therefore , action of this part of the hamiltonian can be represented as , @xmath26.\\ ] ]    analogously , the second line of produce the modified cycles given by , @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ]    -10 mm    combining both results and together , one gets for the total hamiltonian  : [ hamiltonian ] h|s;&= & _ kl2(|s;_k_l- |s;_kl_k_l_kl ) + + & & + _ klk_kl(|s_k_l- |s;__k_l)= + & = & _ kl |s_kl + & & _",
    "kl(h_k^-1(l)-h_^-1(k)^-1(l))_kl |s;.here we introduced the joining / splitting operator @xmath28 , which change the permutation group element as follows , @xmath29 factor @xmath0 for coinciding @xmath8 and @xmath30 appears due to the fact that splitting and joining the trace in the same point results in multiplying by @xmath31 .",
    "note that since @xmath32 appears as index in the spin part the order between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is important .",
    "one can , however re - sum in order to get a form in which spin and permutation parts are completely independent and commute : @xmath35",
    "consider the description of the operators in terms of the spin states . the @xmath36-field operator like should be labelled by the spin variables @xmath37 and a permutation group element @xmath13 .",
    "the spin part itself is represented by a vector in the tensor product of one spin representations corresponding to each `` site '' @xmath38 , @xmath39    obviously , one can choose an orthonormal , basis in the one  spin space such that , @xmath40 and @xmath41    the `` graph '' part of the state we denote by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , permutation group of @xmath36 elements . for the space of permutation there is a natural scalar product , @xmath44 i.e. it is zero for different permutations and unity when contracted with itself .",
    "the states in our model should be represented as elements tensor product of the above two spaces modulo the symmetry group @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the symmetry group acts as follows , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a permutation of indices given by @xmath49 . indeed , as it is not very difficult to see the original and permuted states describe , in fact , the same trace in sym model .",
    "given an arbitrary basis element @xmath50 one can find an element of the factor by averaging with respect to the action of the group @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the cyclic symmetry projector , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the following operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 stays for the order of @xmath45 . as we mentioned",
    "@xmath53 is a projector , i.e. @xmath59 , also it is not difficult to see that @xmath53 commutes with permutation invariant operators .    obviously , the above states are invariant with respect to the action of the gauge group @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath60 this symmetry represents the cyclicity of the trace(s ) .",
    "let us show that the spin bit hamiltonian can be seen as arising from gauging of the planar spin chain . since @xmath13 has the natural interpretation of the connection then the @xmath13 preserving symmetry @xmath61 has the meaning of the `` global '' gauge symmetry .",
    "( in fact this is translation symmetry . )    as we have seen in the previous section , an arbitrary permutation leads to more general transformation rules for `` points '' and `` connections '' @xmath62 now , this is the localized version of the shift transformation , i.e. the discrete analog of the diffeomorphism transformations .    by direct evaluation of the hamiltonian one can show that it is invariant with respect to transformations .",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten in the following form , @xmath63 where , @xmath64 in above expression @xmath65 can be expressed as the discrete gauge connection between sites @xmath8 and @xmath30 .    on the other hand , consider the planar spin chain hamiltonian , @xmath66 where , @xmath67 the above expression differs from the complete nonplanar @xmath65 in eq . by the only fact that operators @xmath28 are replaced by kronecker delta symbols @xmath68 .",
    "now it is clear , that passing from planar to general non - planar description amounts in `` switching on '' the gauge field operator @xmath65 ( or @xmath28 ) , which plays the role of the gauge field .",
    "this procedure is sensitive to transformation properties of the fields to the permutation group action only and not on the structure of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , this procedure can be applied for obtaining the nonplanar hamiltonian in the case of the spin chain with arbitrary group just passing from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
