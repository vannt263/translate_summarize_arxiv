    "it is well known that the critical properties of a given statistical - mechanical system depend only on a small number of parameters like the dimensionality @xmath1 of the system , the symmetry of the order parameter characterizing the corresponding phase transition , and on general properties of the interaction coupling the order parameter at different locations .",
    "for example , in an isotropic @xmath13 system one expects that all critical exponents and scaling function of a given physical quantity are independent on , say , lattice structure , or on short - range details of the interaction .",
    "let us , for definiteness of notation , speak about ising - like systems ( i.e. @xmath14 ) with hamiltonian @xmath15 in the context of the critical phenomena the usual criterion for a given interaction to be considered as short - ranged is finite second moment of @xmath16 , i.e. in terms of the fourier transform @xmath17 of this interaction for small @xmath18 one has @xmath19 where @xmath20 is asymptotically smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "then , if @xmath4 , for the bulk two - point correlation function @xmath22 one normally writes @xmath23 where @xmath24 are two universal scaling functions ( for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) , @xmath27 is a nonuniversal , slowly varying function of temperature that well can be approximated by a constant in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the bulk correlation length , i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 . for @xmath33 one has @xmath34 the above is , in fact , the classical result of fisher @xcite for the two - point correlation function in the critical region of a simple fluid .",
    "note , that when @xmath35 the correlations decay exponentially fast with the distance @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that in simple nonpolar fluids the interactions are characterized by potentials that decay as inverse powers of the distance at large @xmath2 . in @xmath36",
    "the most prominent case is the induced dipole - induced dipole ( or van der waals ) interaction for which ( neglecting the retardation effects ) the potential decays as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a positive constant .",
    "one easily can check that this interaction has a fourier transform which is indeed of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) .",
    "but for such systems ( @xmath1-dimensional ising model ) , in which the interactions decrease in inverse power with respect to the distance between the interacting objects , i.e. as @xmath3 , @xmath39 , the following _ rigorous _ result due to iagolnitzer and souillard @xcite is available .",
    "_ theorem_@xcite : the two - point correlation function @xmath40 of a ferromagnetic system in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath41 does not decay faster than its potential @xmath42 . for any @xmath43 and any real @xmath41 there exists a strictly positive constant @xmath44 , such , that @xmath45    for @xmath46 the theorem is valid for @xmath25 and for any of the two `` pure '' phases ( the `` plus '' and the `` minus '' ones ) for @xmath26 .",
    "the immediate consequence of this theorem is that if @xmath47 ( [ cor ] ) - ( [ cplus ] ) could not be true for @xmath2 large enough independently on how close @xmath48 is to the critical point .",
    "the only way to reconcile ( [ cor ] ) - ( [ cplus ] ) with the above theorem is to realise that if @xmath47 ( [ cor ] ) - ( [ cplus ] ) could be valid only up to some @xmath49 .",
    "then for @xmath50 the correlations will decay as @xmath51 , for @xmath52 they will fall off exponentially , but , for @xmath53 they should again decay in a power law as a function of the distance , namely as @xmath3 . in other words",
    "one should observe a crossover from power law to exponential and then , again , to power law behavior of the correlations .",
    "saying this one immediately stacks with at least two important questions that appear naturally : 1 ) what is the value of @xmath54 , i.e. where this crossover happens and 2 ) what are the properties of the function describing that crossover .",
    "one of the aims of the current article is to answer those questions in the framework of an exactly solvable model .",

    "this asymptotic is confirmed by the exact results for the spherical model due to joyce @xcite and it is in tune with the above theorem for the ising model .",
    "note that for @xmath2 large enough the correlations always fall off in a power law with the distance with the only exception of interactions of a fully finite range when they do decay exponentially .",
    "that ( [ cor ] ) - ( [ cplus ] ) should be modified for the case of subleading long - range interactions has been noticed by several authors .",

    "definitely , if the finite - size two - point correlation function is known for a given _ finite _ system with a characteristic size @xmath99 , then one can determine in this way also the behavior of the finite - size susceptibility @xmath100 . in a recent article @xcite chen and dohm have addressed the question : could one say what should be the scaling structure of the _ finite - size _ susceptibility under periodic boundary conditions if one knows only the _ bulk _ two - point correlation function ?",
    "they suggest a hypothesis , that this is possible by interpreting in a proper way the functional dependence of @xmath96 on @xmath2 as a dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath99 .",

    "the article closes with a discussion ( section [ d ] ) where we speculate about the possible extensions of our results for other models .",
    "we consider a @xmath1-dimensional mean spherical model @xcite , @xcite ( for a comprehensive review on the results available for this model see @xcite ) .",

    "the term @xmath111 in ( [ int2 ] ) is associated with a contribution to the real - space interaction going as @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that @xmath113 if @xmath114 , which reflects the fact that there are no competing interactions in the system and that the only ground state is the ferromagnetic one .",
    "of course , it would be interesting to consider such systems  say with a combination between antiferromagnetic short range and ferromagnetic subleading long - range interactions , but this is out of the scope of the current article .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by the multiple integral @xmath115 ,          \\label{partfun1}\\ ] ] supplemented by the mean spherical condition @xmath116 which can be enforced with the use of a `` lagrange multiplier '' term going as @xmath117 into the effective hamiltonian , and thence into the partition function .",
    "the spherical model equation of state then takes the form @xmath118 the phase transition in this model occurs when the combination @xmath119 takes on a value asymptotically close to zero .",
    "the difference between the equation of state in ( [ msc2 ] ) and the standard mean spherical model condition in short range systems lies in the addition of the term going as @xmath120 in the denominator on the left hand side of ( [ msc2 ] ) .",
    "in general , this term is taken to be negligible , but we will soon see that it leads to interesting effects .    for the model defined in the above way it can be shown , following @xcite , that the bulk correlation function @xmath121 is given by , if @xmath4 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 , and @xmath124 and @xmath125 are nonuniversal constants .",
    "let us note that the values of @xmath126 and @xmath127 are such , that there are no real roots of the equation @xmath128 .",
    "the last follows from the propositions we made for @xmath129 .",
    "note also that in ( [ cord ] ) we have taken the cut - off in the @xmath109-space to be infinity ( for a lattice system it will mean that one considers the limit of a zero lattice spacing ) .",
    "this is possible because of the rapid oscillations of the exponential function in the integrand , but in this way we neglect all finite cut - off effects that will give nonuniversal contributions towards the critical behavior of the two - point correlation function ( see @xcite for details ) . in ( [ cord ] ) @xmath130 is the second moment correlation length defined via ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath131^{-1 } \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k^2 } \\tilde{g}({\\bf k};k|d,\\sigma)\\right |_{k=0},\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is the fourier transform of @xmath121 .",
    "because of this identification one can , in fact , skip for our purposes the analysis of the spherical field equation ( [ msc2 ] ) - one directly has @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath39 and since we are interested in the behavior of @xmath121 for @xmath134 ( note that then the leading order contributions of the integral in ( [ cord ] ) will be coming from small @xmath109 values ) , one can rewrite ( [ cord ] ) in the form @xmath135 i.e. as a sum of `` short - range '' and `` long - range '' parts .",
