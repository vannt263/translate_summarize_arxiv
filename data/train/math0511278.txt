    "( see @xcite for a brief introduction to some of the mathematical aspects of quantum computing . ) in the context of quantum error correction , the @xmath317 are often called `` error operators '' .",
    "it is the effects of such operators that must be mitigated for whenever there is a transfer of quantum information determined by @xmath314 .",
    "there are numerous strategies that have been , and are being , developed for this type of error correction .",
    "we go into detail on this subject in @xcite , but here we indicate how the mathematical conditions that characterize correction in the fundamental protocol for quantum error correction connects with the higher - rank numerical ranges . in the `` standard model '' for quantum error correction @xcite ,",
    "codes are identified with subspaces of the system hilbert space , and `` correctability '' of a given code subspace @xmath318 in terms of an error model @xmath314 is shown to be equivalent to the existence of scalars @xmath319 such that @xmath320 here @xmath321 denotes the projection of the system space onto @xmath318 .",
    "thus , the problem of finding correctable codes for a given error model @xmath322 is equivalent to finding the compression - values inside the higher - rank numerical ranges @xmath323 , @xmath324 and @xmath325 , along with the corresponding projections .",
    "as indicated in @xcite , this problem may be reduced to a system of such problems for hermitian or normal operators .",
