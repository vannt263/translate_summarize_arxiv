    "in an ongoing series of papers , cohen and his colleagues have described a framework for absolute ir calibration that embraces a variety of spaceborne , airborne , and ground - based photometers and spectrometers ( see cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 : hereafter  paper x \" ) , and references therein ) .",
    "the framework currently consists of an all - sky network of over 600 stars ( walker & cohen 2002 ) , each represented by a complete , absolute , low - resolution spectrum from 1.2 to 35  @xmath1 m .",
    "this reliance on calibrated spectra provides the flexibility to incorporate any well - characterized photometer s passbands , and spectrometers , into this common calibration scheme .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 : hereafter  paper xiii \" ) have described the extension of this approach from purely ir template spectra to  supertemplates \" and kurucz ( 1993 ) models , that extend from the ultraviolet to the mid - ir .",
    "these procedures were designed to furnish on - orbit absolute calibrators for the instruments on board nasa s space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) , notably for the infrared array camera ( irac ) .",
    "the technique involves normalizing a spectral supertemplate or model shape , appropriate to the spectral type and luminosity class of a star and suitably reddened , on the basis of optical photometry of the individual star .",
    "irac has four detector arrays , with central wavelengths of 3.6 , 4.5 , 6.5 and 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "the irac detectors are roughly 2000 times more sensitive than those of iras and would have saturated on all but the faintest stars of the existing network .",
    "to create faint calibrators for irac , 2mass @xmath0 data will be used to support these normalizations in the near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "therefore , it is essential to incorporate the 2mass rsrs into the larger context described in papers x and xiii , which already include approximately 110 characterized passbands .",
    "the present paper describes our characterization of the three 2mass passbands , incorporating information on the optics of the 2mass cameras , their detector properties , the atmosphere above the two 2mass telescopes and , in particular , the robustness of the 2mass rsrs to variations in precipitable water vapor above the telescopes .",
    " 2 describes the elements that contribute to the rsrs of the three cameras , and tabulates the requisite combinations of optics+filter+detector+atmosphere that represent the path of starlight through each camera .",
    " 3 presents the rsrs , and provides their absolute ",
    "zero magnitude \" attributes consistently with all other characterized passbands already within table 2 of paper x ( ir bands ) , and tables 3 and 12 of paper xiii ( optical rsrs ) . ",
    "4 investigates the influence of variations in water vapor on the calibration of the @xmath2-band . ",
    "5 builds on the set of thirty three absolute calibrators of intermediate brightness recently constructed in paper xiii , by predicting their 2mass magnitudes and comparing these with those actually observed .",
    "these comparisons are used to determine the  zero point offsets \" ( hereafter zpos : see  5 for their definition ) for 2mass , the final prerequisites before one is able to normalize supertemplate and model spectra directly by 2mass photometry ( see table 3 of paper x for details of the zpos for other ir photometric systems ) .",
    "our effort to characterize the end - to - end rsrs of 2mass is based on the transmission data for the various components of the cameras , which appears as part of the explanatory supplement for 2mass .",
    "figure  [ camera ] illustrates light paths through the overall instrument , while table  [ instrument ] arranges these components from star to detector for each 2mass band .",
    "no end - to - end wavelength - dependent rsrs were measured for the 2mass system .",
    "therefore , we have constructed these , from the products of the reflection and transmission characteristics of the relevant elements in the optical trains , to yield single files that can be used for synthetic photometry .",
    "[ instrument ]    the primary and secondary mirrors of the pair of 2mass telescopes have identical coatings .",
    "the plotted curve at the explanatory supplement s url is for a single reflection and , therefore , appears squared when one accounts for total system transmission .",
    "the transmission of the external dewar window applies identically to the @xmath0 paths .",
    "all three optical paths through the cameras contain seven coated lenses : one common lens ahead of the dichroics and six lenses per channel behind the dichroics .",
    "the  camera lens coatings \" curve on the web is for transmission through a single lens element with its coatings .",
    "thus , it is raised to the 7th power to assess the total spectral transmission through each lens assembly .",
    "the three dichroic mirrors occur in different combinations of reflection and transmission to provide the distinct light paths for the cameras ( table  [ instrument ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 filter profiles quoted were tested at 77  k. the optical coatings were almost certainly tested at room temperature but the vendor provides no specifications or comparisons to document their behavior at the actual operating temperatures in the 2mass cameras .",
    "the appropriate curves are already flat so that the expected wavelength shifts and shape changes are probably insignificant .",
    "the same consideration applies to the dichroic profiles : steep gradients in transmission and/or reflection occur in regions already blocked by the filters .",
    "adequate data exist within the 2mass project for all components except for the detector quantum efficiency ( hereafter dqe ) curves that pertain to the actual 2mass detector arrays .",
    "only limited work was performed by rockwell , in general , to characterize dqe as a function of wavelength .",
    "no specific characterization was provided for the 2mass arrays . however",
    ", real curves were measured and supplied by rockwell as part of the characterization and calibration of denis ( fouqu   et al . 2000 ) for 12 regions surrounding the denis detectors , in each of the boules that provided the material from which the denis @xmath5 detectors were cut .",
    "the arcetri near - infrared camera ( arnica ) also contains a 256@xmath6256 nicmos3 array and was tested in tucson at the same time as the 2mass arrays were tested .",
    "l. k. hunt has kindly provided us with the generic dqe information that she was offered by rockwell when arnica s array was delivered , and she reports that arnica has lower quantum efficiency than the 2mass devices .",
    "figure  [ dqe ] compares the actual dqe curves for the denis @xmath2 and @xmath7 arrays with the generic information accompanying arnica .",
    "there are broad similarities between the structure displayed in the curves for all three devices , particularly within the range from 12.2  @xmath1 m .",
    "we have , therefore , chosen to represent the 2mass dqe curves by the  generic \" curve accompanying arnica , which was intended as an exemplar of the material used in the 256@xmath6256 format .",
    "the generic curve clearly satisfies the characteristics of nicmos3 hgcdte , as suggested by the denis curves .",
    "given our ignorance of the actual 2mass devices performance with wavelength , the qualitative statement that the overall value of the dqe for 2mass s arrays exceeds that for arnica is not an issue because we will renormalize all derived rsrs so their peaks are unity .",
    "we are grateful to dr .",
    "m. f. skrutskie for locating a set of plots from rockwell characterizing the hgcdte material produced at about the same time that the 2mass nicmos3 arrays were in production ( 1996 ) .",
    "this documents dqe at 8 locations , albeit for a 1024@xmath61024 array .",
    "the curves are in broad agreement with those we offer in figure  [ dqe ] , and combine the broad plateau seen in arnica around 1.3  @xmath1 m with the elevated levels of the denis arrays beyond 2.0  @xmath1 m .      to represent the intervening telluric transmissions above mt hopkins , az ( mho ) and cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile",
    ", we represented the atmospheric transmissions using plexus , an afrl validated  expert system \" that incorporates atmospheric code , specifically modtran 3.7 , samm , and fascode3p with the hitran98 archives .",
    "plexus contains an extensive database to support its expert aspect , so that the effects of aerosols and particulates appropriate to the desert conditions of the 2mass sites were included .",
    "paper x also used plexus calculations to represent the site - specific atmospheric transmissions necessary to represent the more than one hundred ground - based filters characterized in that work .",
    "we first verified that the ratio of plexus - computed transmissions at mho and ctio was flat over the entire passbands of the @xmath3 and @xmath7 filters , and almost all the @xmath2 band , and very similar .",
    "therefore , the use of a single calculation to incorporate the atmosphere for both 2mass telescopes is justified .      with the sole exception of the dqe curves , every element in the 2mass instrument",
    "is represented by data germane to the final survey cameras .",
    "strictly , the direct products of all these component curves are valid only if we can ignore the  stierwalt effect \" . if an interference filter is placed in close proximity to a detector array , the out - of - band - rejection may be greatly changed due to the increased solid angle seen by the detector .",
    "filters are usually measured in a  collimated \" beam , the rejected flux being scattered into a larger solid angle .",
    "we have explicitly assumed that this effect is not an issue within the 2mass cameras .",
    "lacking quantitative uncertainties for the characteristics of all these components , we have assigned an overall wavelength - independent error of 5% to the resulting rsrs .",
    "figure  [ rsrs ] presents the three rsrs for 2mass , including all the optics described above , the ( arnica ) generic dqe curve , and a single plexus atmosphere representative of typical survey conditions .",
    "we have followed standard practice by normalizing each rsr to unity at its peak .",
    "note that these rsrs are designed to be integrated directly over stellar spectra in f@xmath8 form , in order to calculate synthetic photometric magnitudes .",
    "the quantum efficiency based component was converted to yield photon - counting rsrs by multiplying by @xmath9 and renormalizing , exactly as described by bessell ( 2000 ) .",
    "these three rsrs can be found on the web at : http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/second/doc/sec3_1b1.tbl12.html ( @xmath2 ) ; + http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/second/doc/sec3_1b1.tbl13.html ( @xmath3 ) ; + http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/second/doc/sec3_1b1.tbl14.html ( @xmath4 ) , but will soon be moved to analogous urls on the  allsky \" site .      on some 2mass survey nights , as much as a 20% variation in response in the @xmath2-band channel has been seen , presumably due to changes in telluric transmission .",
    "figure  [ rsrs ] indicates that the @xmath2-band rsr is significantly influenced by water vapor near 1.35  @xmath1 m .",
    "it is particularly susceptible to intra - night , as well as night - to - night , variations .",
    "if all else were unchanged , it is of interest to find out how variable the response might be if it depended solely on the water vapor content of the atmosphere , especially in the @xmath2-band .",
    "therefore , we investigated the rsrs that would arise as a result of an order of magnitude variation in precipitable water , specifically for amounts of 0.5 and 5  mm .",
    "the former would have been a rather rare occurrence during 2mass operations , while somewhat more than 5  mm would represent the worst conditions under which survey data were collected .",
    "these calculations were performed with the atran code ( lord 1992 ) .",
    "calculating for the altitude of mho , atran predicts about 6.5  mm of precipitable water , but atran enables arbitrary changes , to our selected values of 0.5 and subsequently to 5  mm , without altering any other aspect of the atmosphere ( note that , although atran lacks aerosols , particulates , and an expert database , it is a highly flexible code for the study of water vapor variations ) . figure  [ jh2o ] illustrates the pair of resulting rsrs .",
    "the final adopted @xmath2 rsr also appears in figure  [ jh2o ] where it is seen to compare very favorably with the atran transmission curve for 5  mm of water .",
    "we still prefer the plexus products because they have been used throughout paper x , and for denis ( fouqu  et al .",
    "2000 ) , and because the  expert \" mode offers additional realism to our characterization of the atmosphere .",
    "the amount of precipitable water vapor in an atran model is not directly comparable to that implied by a plexus model for the same site because of the dependence on the database of actual measurements in plexus , and the inclusion of other phenomena .",
    "no effects were found on the 2mass @xmath3 or @xmath7 bands due to these gross variations in water vapor .",
    "to intermingle optical and ir photometry in the normalization of calibrated supertemplates ( paper xiii ) requires that every band be well - characterized and that all are integrated over the identical , absolutely calibrated , kurucz spectrum of vega published by cohen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which underpins the entire context of paper x and , consequently , that of 2mass and sirtf too . in the ir",
    "we adopt the synthetic vega spectrum as the definition of zero magnitude , whereas small but nonzero magnitudes apply in the optical ( e.g. bessell et al .",
    "1998 ; paper xiii ) .",
    "table  [ cal ] details the attributes for zero magnitude for 2mass , giving in - band fluxes , isophotal wavelengths and frequencies , and the corresponding isophotal monochromatic intensities in f@xmath10 and f@xmath11 units , all calculated using the rsrs in this paper .",
    "2mass @xmath0 can thereby be transparently compared with photometry in any of the bands in paper x , and with spectra from all instruments using this common calibration scheme that unifies ground - based , airborne , and spaceborne calibrators .",
    "table  [ water ] offers an estimate of the _ differences _ in the absolute calibration of the 2mass @xmath2-band for both 0.5 and 5  mm of water , based on the results of constructing rsrs using atran , not plexus . although the resulting in - band fluxes vary by almost 11% , the isophotal quantities are quite robust in showing only a 2% variation .",
    "our _ recommended _ calibration of 2mass at @xmath2 appears in table  [ cal ] , based on plexus .",
    "table  [ water ] is shown purely to quantify the impact of isolated water variations on the @xmath2-band absolute calibration .",
    "[ cal ]    [ water ]",
    "2mass represents an extremely large body of system magnitudes , defined with respect to an internally homogeneous set of reference stars .",
    "because these stars are not already members of the all - sky network of relatively bright calibrators of paper x , we require one final step before we can convert 2mass magnitudes into physical units that are self - consistent with those used by the diffuse infrared background explorer , infrared telescope in space , kuiper airborne observatory , midcourse space experiment , infrared space observatory , and sirtf .",
    "this step is the definition of the 2mass zpos .",
    "the zpos are necessary in order to compute absolute quantities using 2mass magnitudes and table  [ cal ] , in the form @xmath12(0@xmath13 ) , where _ m _ is the observed 2mass magnitude and _ z _ is the algebraic zpo for that band .",
    "ideally , any photometric system calibrated in the common context of paper x would be based on the use of any of the more than 600 stars now represented by complete , absolute , 1.235  @xmath1 m spectra ( e.g. , those of paper x ) .",
    "however , the extension of this network to a set of calibrators of intermediate brightness ( i.e. @xmath14=410 ) , suitable for use by 2mass , has occurred only very recently , in readiness for sirtf .",
    "therefore , we will compute the zpos _ post facto _ , as the ensemble - averaged algebraic differences between observed and predicted 2mass @xmath0 for a set of stars previously absolutely calibrated using other well - characterized nir data not based on 2mass .",
    "paper xiii sets out the procedures by which the suite of irac absolute calibrators has been defined , and then applies them to the creation of a set of thirty three 1.235  @xmath1 m fiducial k0-m0iiis and a0-a5v stars , drawn from two sets of precision standards : landolt s ( 1992 ) optical standards , and the carter & meadows ( 1995 ) optical - nir photometric stars .",
    "these stars now extend the all - sky network described in paper x downward by factors of 100 - 1000 in ir brightness . at these levels",
    ", they are suitable for cross - ties to 2mass .",
    "the twenty four cool giants are based on @xmath15 data ( supplemented when available by hipparcos and tycho data , also calibrated in the common context : see table 12 in paper xiii ) and on well - characterized @xmath16 measurements either from tenerife (  tcs \" ) or south africa (  saao \" : see paper x , tables 2 and 3 ) . the nine a - dwarfs are based entirely on @xmath17 data from carter & meadows ( 1995 ) .    by integrating these absolute spectra through the newly - defined 2mass rsrs and converting the resulting in - band fluxes into magnitudes using table  [ cal ] , we have derived the predicted set of 2mass magnitudes .",
    "direct comparison of these with the final version of observed 2mass magnitudes enables us to define the ",
    "mean algebraic deviation \" ( hereafter mad ) of a star , by averaging the @xmath18 differences for that star .",
    "table  [ cml ] presents the data for all thirty three stars , giving , for every star : name ; spectral type ; predicted and observed 2mass @xmath0 magnitudes and uncertainties ; the differences between these , with their associated errors ; and the mad .",
    "the ensemble average mad results from combining all the ( observed - minus - predicted ) differences among the thirty three stars , either without weighting ( -0.001@xmath190.005 mag ) or using inverse - variance weighting ( + 0.002@xmath190.003 mag ) .",
    "we conclude that this set of stars has no significant bias , rendering it ideal to define the 2mass zpos .",
    "the uncertainty used for each observed 2mass magnitude is the associated @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or  @xmath22 \" ,",
    "i.e. the  complete \" error which incorporates the results of processing the photometry , internal errors ( from @xmath23n photon statistics and sky background ) , and calibration errors ( nightly zero point , flat fielding , and normalization uncertainties for each band ) .",
    "we were able to use differences for 33 @xmath2 , 30 @xmath3 , and 32 @xmath7 magnitudes .",
    "@xmath3-band data for three stars ( hd172651 = sa110 - 471 ; sa107 - 35 ; sa108 - 827 ) were rejected because of saturation and/or the concomitant reduced ",
    "n out of m \" ( where only n measurements with aperture photometry above 3@xmath24 were obtained out of a possible m , a common occurrence for objects on the r1 saturation threshold ) , or the intrusion of an artifact on one star s @xmath3-band image .",
    "one @xmath7 magnitude ( for sa110 - 471 ) was rejected from consideration because fewer than 3 non - saturated frames were obtained (  ph_qual\"=e \" ) .",
    "all rejected magnitudes and the associated mads are identified by an asterisk in table  [ cml ] .",
    "we have plotted the resulting mads for the individual stars of the ensemble against spectral type ( figure  [ madspt ] ) , 2mass @xmath25 color ( figure  [ madjk ] ) , and 2mass @xmath14 magnitude ( figure  [ madk ] ) and found no perceptible biases with respect to these quantities . the resulting ensemble - averaged zpos required to align 2mass with our common context by algebraically adding them to the final 2mass magnitudes are : + 0.001@xmath190.005 ( @xmath2 ) ; 0.019@xmath190.007 ( @xmath3 ) ; + 0.017@xmath190.005 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have defined element - by - element , photon - counting rsrs for all three 2mass filter bands , incorporating the properties of detectors , filters , dichroics , lenses , coatings , dewar window , telescopes , and the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the rsrs are absolutely calibrated in the common context of cohen et al .",
    "( 1999,2003 ) , and zero point offsets have been developed for 2mass using thirty three new absolute calibrators of intermediate brightness .",
