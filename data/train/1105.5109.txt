    "the study of the superfluid density or superfuid stiffness in response to disorder or defects can provide valuable information about the nature of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the superfluid density @xmath5 is proportional to the inverse - square of the penetration depth @xmath8 , a characteristic length of a bulk superconductor determining the penetration of a magnetic field inside it .",
    "the low - temperature dependence of @xmath9 is being studied extensively to unravel the pairing symmetry of the ground state of bulk superconductors . in conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs )",
    "superconductors , with a fully gapped excitation spectrum , the penetration depth exhibits exponential behavior at low temperatures . in contrast , in unconventional superconductors , with nodal lines or nodal points of the gap function on the fermi surface , @xmath9 shows power - law behavior depending on the type of nodes.@xcite therefore the observation of power laws in @xmath10 has been taken synonymous with unconventional pairing symmetries in the heavy - fermion and high - temperature copper - oxide superconductors .",
    "it is known that disorder changes the power - law behavior from linear to quadratic in @xmath7 for @xmath1-wave superconductivity as disorder fills in impurity states in the nodal gap regions.@xcite since then it was shown that disorder in unconventional superconductors leads to an even stronger suppression of the superfluid density @xmath5 relative to its superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 than expected from unitarity scattering in the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) theory .",
    "in particular , franz and co - workers@xcite investigated short - coherence - length superconductivity in cuprates , that is , the coherence length @xmath11 is comparable to the lattice parameter @xmath12 , and demonstrated that it behaves markedly differently from the ag theory of impurity - averaged order parameters .",
    "in fact , detailed calculations of the spatial dependence of the local density of states and order parameter in the vicinity of an impurity with strong ( unitarity ) nonmagnetic scattering potential showed that the order parameter is abruptly suppressed within just a few lattice parameters resembling the holes within a swiss cheese.@xcite this is in stark contrast to the assumption in the ag theory of pair - breaking with a spatially uniform suppressed impurity - averaged order parameter .",
    "the swiss cheese model was originally introduced to explain the universal scaling behavior of superconducting transition temperature versus zero - temperature superfluid density in the uemura plot , @xmath3 vs.  @xmath13,@xcite of underdoped high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors@xcite and found a recent revival for describing the behavior of kondo holes in heavy - fermion superconductors.@xcite    in this work , we use the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) lattice model to study the effects of disorder on bulk and local properties in superconducting pucoga@xmath0 .",
    "plutonium - based superconductors can be thought of as superconducting clocks , since the natural radioactivity of pu ( @xmath14pu half - life = @xmath15 years ) creates lattice defects like clockwork , which scatter electrons and break cooper pairs .",
    "pair - breaking creates impurity bands in the nodal regions affecting the signature of a pure @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "such pair - breaking effects are evident in the suppression of @xmath3 with time,@xcite the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath16,@xcite where the @xmath17 temperature dependence switches to a linear - in-@xmath7 behavior , and the penetration depth @xmath9 , where the linear - in-@xmath7 temperature dependence gives way to a @xmath18 behavior at low temperatures.@xcite unlike other bulk probes , the magnitude of @xmath19 is very sensitive to defects owing to its nature of measuring the stiffness of the superconducting phase coherence in the sample , whereas the magnitude of @xmath3 is less sensitive to defects , since it is related to the spatial average of the order parameter .",
    "a detailed account of this difference will be presented .",
    "the main result of our study is that self - irradiation - induced defects in pucoga@xmath0 violate the ag theory of dilute disorder in superconductors , which is based on the premise of an impurity - averaged order parameter , while it is fully consistent with the swiss cheese model of short - coherence - length superconductors .",
    "our detailed calculations show that measurements of the transition temperature and superfluid density in fresh ( 25 day - old ) and aged ( 400 day - old ) pucoga@xmath0 are fully consistent with the swiss cheese model of disorder , which captures both the 20% suppression of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 and a large 70% suppression of the superfluid density @xmath20 between aged and fresh samples , as well as the temperature dependence of @xmath21 .",
    "finally , our study of the swiss cheese model exemplifies the common behavior of the superfluid density in unconventional short - coherence - length superconductors with disorder . because of spatially extended quasiparticle excitations along the nodal directions of the order parameter , in the presence of a strong on - site impurity potential , one finds the suppression of @xmath21  to extend over several coherence lengths , whereas the suppression of the order parameter is very localized and limited to a few lattice sites . in that respect a close relationship between the copper - oxide and plutonium based superconductors exists .",

    "iii b. in sec .",
    "iii c we present the uemura plot of @xmath3 vs.  @xmath13 for the pu - based compound and compare with the results for cuprate superconductors . finally , we conclude in sec .  v.",
    "we begin with the bdg mean - field theory of the attractive hubbard model which was used extensively to describe superconductivity in correlated electron systems .",

    "this generic approach was consequently applied to two - dimensional @xmath1-wave @xcite and @xmath23-wave  @xcite superconductors .",
    "it has been shown that superconductivity in pucoga@xmath0 is unconventional because thermodynamic , transport , nuclear magnetic resonance , and neutron scattering data are consistent with a model based on @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry ( that is , based on nodal lines in the gap function).@xcite first - principles calculations@xcite have shown that pucoga@xmath0 hosts a fermi surface with four sheets , of which two are cylindrical sheets centered at the m point in the brillouin zone .",
    "the quasi - two - dimensional nature is related to the layered structure of pu atoms forming a square lattice . for simplicity , we consider only a single - band model , which captures the essential physics of @xmath1-wave superconductors . in order to describe the disorder effect on superconductivity , we consider a tight - binding model hamiltonian defined on a square lattice : @xmath24 here @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at the @xmath27-th site of spin @xmath28 .",

    "once the bdg equations are solved , many interesting properties can be explored .",
    "for example , for a given concentration of disorder , the superconducting transition temperature can be determined by the condition that the averaged superconducting order parameter vanishes .",

    "our bdg lattice formulation of the superfluid density follows closely the seminal work by scalapino and coworkers@xcite for the hubbard model on a lattice .",

    "the spatial dependence of the superfluid density @xmath84 is also strongly localized around the impurity with characteristic features more similar to the ldos than the order parameter . to illustrate this type of swiss cheese phenomenon of strongly suppressed superconducting properties near an impurity",

    "the spatial order parameter amplitude @xmath83 , plotted in fig .",
    "1(b2 ) , creates a resonance state at the impurity site , reflecting the pair - breaking characteristics of @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "the fourfold modulation of the order parameter is preserved in the case of a scalar impurity , while the suppression is smoother along the nodal direction where strongly damped friedel oscillations are found .",
    "in contrast , the superfluid density @xmath84 shows the usual fourfold modulation but in addition picks up the phase of the @xmath46-wave pairing symmetry as shown in fig .",
    "along the ( 100)-antinodal direction , where the gap is positive , @xmath94 shows a remarkable enhancement from its average value at the nn lattice site from the impurity ( red line ) , whereas the nn lattice site along the ( 010)-antinodal direction exhibits stronger suppression ( blue dashed line ) .",

    "the low - temperature ( @xmath95 ) approximation yields a linear behavior of the superfluid density for gapless nodal quasiparticles on the fermi surface : @xcite @xmath96 here , the slope @xmath97 is determined by the bcs ratio @xmath98 . in the presence of an impurity with large broadening @xmath99 , the lowest order temperature dependence of the superfluid density becomes @xmath18 [ refs .  ]",

    "1(c3 ) we see that at the nn site ` a ' along the ( 100 ) direction , where @xmath102 shows a peak , the corresponding @xmath103 shows a quasilinear behavior at low temperatures , within the error produced by finite - size effect . at the nnn site ` b ' along the node , the superfluid density is suppressed showing a @xmath18 dependence in accord with the average value .",
    "we believe that in principle magnetic field - angle dependent measurements of the magnetization can provide a unique and indispensable tool to probe the presence of gap nodes and shed light on the pairing symmetry in the ground state of a bulk superconductor .",
    "this idea is related to the observation of the nonlinear meissner effect predicted by yip and sauls@xcite for fields along the nodal and antinodal directions . however , its analysis will be complicated by surface bound states.@xcite    next we turn to the case of randomly distributed impurities in fig .  2 for a concentration @xmath104 , where the local information of the previously discussed quantities changes more dramatically across the entire lattice",
    "nevertheless , the local response of all quantities with respect to the impurity location as well as the one - to - one correspondence between ldos , order parameter , and superfluid density is present for all impurity concentrations studied .",
    "differences between multiple impurities and single impurity are appreciable in all calculated spectra . due to the quasiparticle interference and the overlap of wavefunctions of quasiparticles scattering off impurities ,",
    "friedel oscillations are enhanced and present for all directions shown in fig .",

    "similarly , the differences in the @xmath7 dependence of properties at each site is more clearly visible here as can be seen in fig .",
    "2(a3)-(c3 ) .",
    "for example , at position ` b ' , which sits at the center along the nodal direction between two impurities , one can probe the gapless quasiparticles and thus show quasi - linear behavior in @xmath21 at low @xmath7 .",
    "whereas at site ` a ' , which sits nearly at the center between two impurities , but along an off - nodal direction , one sees enhancement in @xmath88 and @xmath22 at low @xmath7 .",
    "figure  3 presents the calculated dos ( averaged over the entire 35-by-35 lattice sites ) as a function of energy for the @xmath1-wave pairing case and impurity concentrations @xmath105% . the disorder - induced change in the dos is also reflected in the temperature dependence of the spatially averaged superfluid density . since finite - size effects are more pronounced at low energy and for low impurity concentrations , for example , the zero - energy dos of the pure sample ( red line ) in fig .",
    "3(a ) is expected to vanish , while it is of the order of the numerical broadening term @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the normal state dos at the fermi level .",
    "for the same reasons , the low - temperature values of @xmath21 are expected to be less accurate .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations reproduce the hallmark ` v'-shaped feature of the dos due to @xmath108wave pairing for all concentrations .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , with increasing concentration not only is the gap amplitude decreasing , but also the gap nodes become more filled in by impurity states , see shaded and colored areas in fig .",

    "we show that the quadratic dependence of the superfluid density arises from the combined effects of the sc ` gap filling ' and ` gap closing ' in response to the presence of strong disorder .",
    "furthermore , both the fresh and aged pucoga@xmath0 samples are consistent with the swiss cheese model for a weak - coupling gap @xmath138 [ @xmath113 , averaged over four nn sites for @xmath1-wave pairing ] that is suppressed by strong impurity scattering .",
    "finally , our lattice calculations show that although the order parameter is significantly suppressed in the immediate vicinity of impurities , and the superfluid density is strongly suppressed over extended regions along the nodal directions , the superconductivity remains remarkably resilient .",
    "these calculations provide further evidence that pucoga@xmath0 is the link between low - temperature heavy - fermion and high - temperature cuprate superconductors .",

    "<S> we present superfluid density calculations for the unconventional superconductor pucoga@xmath0 by solving the real - space bogoliubov - de gennes equations on a square lattice within the swiss cheese model in the presence of strong on - site disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we find that despite strong electronic inhomogeneity , one can establish a one - to - one correspondence between the local maps of the density of states , superconducting order parameter , and superfluid density . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> strong on - site impurity scattering punches localized holes into the fabric of @xmath1-wave superconductivity similar to a swiss cheese . </S>",
    "<S> already a two - dimensional impurity concentration of @xmath2 gives rise to a pronounced short - range suppression of the order parameter and a suppression of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 by roughly 20% compared to its pure limit value @xmath4 , whereas the superfluid density @xmath5 is reduced drastically by about 70% . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with available experimental data for aged ( 400 day - old ) and fresh ( 25 day - old ) pucoga@xmath0 superconducting samples . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the @xmath6dependence of the low-@xmath7 superfluid density , a signature of dirty @xmath1-wave superconductivity , originates from a combined effect in the density of states of ` gap filling ' and ` gap closing ' . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstate that the uemuera plot of @xmath3 vs.  @xmath5 deviates sharply from the conventional abrikosov - gorkov theory for radiation - induced defects in pucoga@xmath0 , but follows the same trend of short - coherence - length high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors . </S>"
