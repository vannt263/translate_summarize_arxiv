    "the performance of the cern lhc and the rapid collection of data by both atlas and cms will allow for detailed studies of the properties of the recently discovered boson  @xcite in the coming years .",
    "the first reported observations of the production cross section and branching fractions are consistent  @xcite with the expectation from a standard model higgs boson  @xcite with the observed mass @xmath2 , but sizeable uncertainties caused by the limited statistics are still present .",
    "the projected amount of data collected this year will not only reduce these uncertainties , but may also allow for the study of properties beyond total rates .    in many extensions of the standard model the existence of @xmath3-odd bosons",
    "are predicted .",
    "therefore , studying the @xmath3  properties of the boson is of great importance to confirm if the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is minimal or not . a detailed study of the kinematic distributions in the production of the boson in association with two jets  @xcite will eventually allow for the direct measurement of the @xmath3  of the boson  @xcite .",
    "equally important are direct measurements of the higgs couplings to all other particles of the standard model . in particular , the loop - induced @xmath4 vertex is sensitive to new degrees of freedom , where direct production might be beyond the energy reach of the lhc .",
    "the number of observed signal events depends on the sum of the production processes and the decay branching ratio : @xmath5 assuming no interference between the different production channels @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denote the involved higgs couplings .",
    "the sum in the denominator runs over all kinematically accessible final states in the decay .",
    "the precision in measuring any coupling of the higgs boson obviously benefits from separating the production mechanisms .    in this respect",
    "@xmath8 is important for two reasons .",
    "first we observe an excess in @xmath9 in current analyses , especially in the @xmath10 category @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of the @xmath11 channel heavily relies on the @xmath10 final state .",
    "for @xmath12 we currently observe under - production @xcite .",
    "if both these findings prevail and follow from new physics beyond the sm , a precise investigation beyond simple ratios , which will also incorporate modifications of the gf and wbf production modes , will majorly depend on wbf / gf separation in this channel .",
    "@xmath13 is roughly composed 50:50 by gluon fusion ( gf ) and weak boson fusion ( wbf ) , depending on , _",
    "e.g. _ , the cut on the invariant dijet mass . in this context , it is important to note that the quantum interference between the gf and wbf components of @xmath14 production is completely negligible  @xcite , and hence it is possible to consider these two contributions separately .",
    "also , the theoretical uncertainty of the gf contribution is much larger than it is for wbf production @xcite , especially within the wbf - selection cuts .    in this letter",
    ", we construct a likelihood function which is based on wbf and gf matrix elements which precisely serves this purpose to separate the production mechanisms , _",
    "i.e. _ we apply the _ matrix element method _",
    "@xcite to the @xmath15 process on the fully - showered and hadronized final state .",
    "we also generalize the gf  vs.  wbf vs.  background discrimination in a realistic analysis by including the @xmath16 matrix elements .",
    "this constitutes the main irreducible backgrounds to this search  @xcite .",
    "employing this strategy allows to optimize cut scenarios to enhance signal - over - background @xmath0 .",
    "given that the irreducible @xmath17 constitutes @xmath18% of the total background @xcite an additional handle to reduce it will greatly improve the sensitivity of the experimental analyses .",

    "[ sec:14tev ] .",
    "this is the setup , for which most precision higgs results can be obtained from a large luminosity sample @xmath21experiment .",
    "we discuss the systematic uncertainties of various approximations of the signal event generation , especially for the gf contribution , and we also include the impact of finite detector resolution .    equipped with these insights , we discuss the implications of the matrix element method for @xmath22 for the 8  tev run and current results  @xcite in sec .",

    "we implement the cteq6l1 set @xcite in the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq : signaln ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : signaln ] ) provides a one - dimensional probability distribution , which expresses statistical compatibility with either of the two hypotheses in the best suitable way , by definition . by including @xmath27 to the event selection",
    ", we can optimize @xmath28 depending on the purification requirement .",
    "the expectation values @xmath29 follow from mc simulations of signal and background , similar to the construction of simple binned log - likelihood ratio hypothesis tests  @xcite .",
    "exclusive number of jets distribution for the lhc running 14 tev .",
    "the selection cuts are described in the text . ]",
    "we apply the effective top approximation in the following for the gf contribution and the @xmath30 decay via operators @xcite @xmath31 new degrees of freedom which alter the gf contribution and/or modify the higgs couplings to weak bosons can be included as a global factor in the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq : signaln ] ) .",
    "a global factor merely shifts the @xmath32 by a constant factor , which is irrelevant for the probabilistic discrimination of gf vs.  wbf .",
    "the model - specific details enter the sampling of @xmath33 and in the individual normalizations .      +            the matrix elements that enter eq .",
    "( [ eq : signaln ] ) are functions of parton - level kinematics and we have to define an algorithm which maps the fully showered and hadronized jet final state to a suitable set of ( massless ) kinematics , which also includes information about the events initial state .",
    "we do this in the following way : we first cluster jets with @xcite and reconstruct the isolated photons according to the respective analysis requirements ( see further below ) .",
    "we count the number of jets passing the @xmath34 threshold in the events .",
    "we then re - distribute the transverse recoil against unresolved radiation .",

    "we scale the energy of the resulting objects such that @xmath35 . from the sum of these objects",
    ", we get an overall energy reconstructed boost of the considered particle system , which allows to define two momentum fractions of initial state momenta . this way , starting from an exclusive number of reconstructed jets @xmath36 and photons @xmath37 , that comply with the analysis requirements we end up with a set of parton level four momenta which we use for the calculation of the ratios @xmath38 .",
    "this procedure is obviously not limited to mc studies and can be incorporated by experiments straightforwardly .    to discriminate signal from background we generalize eq .",

    "we generate two and three jet ckkw - matched @xcite and un - matched samples with @xcite , which implements the effective top approximation in the gluon fusion channels @xcite .",
    "the events are generated with s default ct10  @xcite pdf set to avoid biasing the analysis of the likelihood distributions .",
    "it is known that the effective theory does not provide a valid description of the phenomenology as soon as we are sensitive to momentum transfers larger than the top mass , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath41 .",
    "cross sections , on the other hand , are reproduced at the percent level , which follows from smaller effective theory cross sections for @xmath42 cancelling the excess with respect to the full calculation for @xmath43 . for large momentum transfers",
    "@xmath44 the deviations become larger than @xmath45 . to fully capture the dynamics in a two - dimensional likelihood , which extends eqs .",
    "( [ eq : signaln ] ) ,  ( [ eq : signalb ] ) by the inclusion of the events energy scale would need to incorporate the full mass dependence and a parametrization of potential new physics .    to test our effective theory approximation",
    "( note that we both simulate and analyze the event within the effective approximation ) , we also analyze a gf event sample obtained with @xcite , which includes the full top and bottom contributions .",
    "we pass the parton - level events to  @xcite for showering and hadronization .",
    "this allows us to asses the bias of analyzing the events with effective theory matrix elements .",
    "finite detector resolution effects give rise to an additional systematic uncertainty when we want to analyze the discriminating power of the matrix element method .",

    "@xcite : @xmath46 for the photons we have performed a comparison of the invariant diphoton mass against the experimental results of @xcite and find that a resolution uncertainty parametrized by 3% describes the experimental situation in sufficiently well for our purposes .    details of the 14 tev cut set - up are currently unknown ; they will depend on the new pile - up and underlying event conditions as well as on the potential excess in the @xmath19 signal cross sections .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we therefore adopt a cut setup which is based on phenomenological analyses ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in sec .",
    "( [ sec:8tev ] ) we employ the current 8 tev selection of atlas  @xcite .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath47 jets @xcite with @xmath48 and threshold @xmath49 in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath50 , and require @xmath51 . the exactly two isolated photons",
    "are required to be central in the electromagnetic calorimeter @xmath52 with @xmath53 ( we define a photon to be isolated if the electromagnetic and hadronic activity in the cone with size @xmath54 is less then @xmath55 of the @xmath56 of the photon candidate ) .",
    "the photons have to reconstruct the higgs mass @xmath57 within @xmath58 . on top of these generic cuts",
    "we impose a typical wbf selection : the two jets , leading in @xmath59 are required to have a large invariant mass @xmath60 and have to fall into opposite detector hemispheres @xmath61 .",
    "+          for these 14 tev selection criteria we show the normalized distribution of the exclusive number of jets for 14 tev in fig .  [",
    "fig : nj14 ] ( for a detailed analysis of this observable see ref .",
    "the cross sections are @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "from this we see that we can limit our analysis to @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "higher jet multiplicities contribute at a level which is challenged by the theoretical uncertainties of the inclusive @xmath66 cross sections @xcite .",
    "the extension to @xmath67 is technically straightforward .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig:2jllh ] .",
    "an immediate first observation is that neither the definition of the likelihoods nor the impact of either detector resolution or details of the event simulation have a significant impact on the discriminating power of @xmath68 . keeping in mind that we already look at wbf - like events and have a reconstructed higgs boson , a cut on @xmath69",
    "will significantly enhance the wbf contribution over gf production .",
    "this is even more the case for @xmath70 .",
    "this can be understood along the following lines .",
    "additional jet radiation in the wbf component is essentially qcd bremsstrahlung off the leading jets since there is no color exchange between the quark legs .",
    "this is entirely different for the gf contribution , which tends to populate the large available phase space in the central region with qcd activity @xcite .",
    "not only the presence of this radiation  @xcite , but , more importantly , the information that is encrypted in the differential energy - momentum flow associated with it @xcite provides an elaborate handle to separate wbf from gf .",
    "this is most efficiently reflected in @xmath71 , of which only @xmath72 is statistically relevant as jet based observables is not considered . ] .",
    "the result of gf / wbf purification is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : llhr14 ] .",
    "going to large values @xmath73 , we recover a high level of purification within the limits of the selection criteria as expected , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , respectively . comparing to figs .",
    "[ fig:2jllh ] , this comes at the price of increasingly small signal cross sections . a more realistic analysis ( that also includes a more realistic description of the detector environment , pile - up , etc . ) needs to optimize the signal rate with respect to purification .",
    "applying multiple cuts on @xmath38 for an identically chosen basic cut set - up , on the other hand , can be used to define distinct signal regions which allow to reconstruct the wbf / gf content upon correlating the two measurements .",
    "+        this finding needs to be contrasted to the standard paradigm of wbf / gf separation via a larger @xmath76 cut . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjj14 ] , we show the relative fraction of full one - loop gf vs.  nlo qcd wbf for @xmath20 as a function of the imposed @xmath76 selection .",
    "we see that the emerging quark - induced processes at large @xmath77 for a stiff @xmath76 cut saturate the relative fraction at about @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting event topology is wbf - like at small total cross sections .",
    "central jet vetos can further decrease the relative contribution , but challenges the perturbative description @xcite .",
    "we now turn to signal vs.  background discrimination . in fig .",
    "[ fig:14bkg ] we show the distributions for @xmath79 for our @xmath20 selection .",
    "obviously , by cutting on @xmath80 , we can purify the signal+background sample without loosing too much of the signal count . this way the signal compared to the irreducible background",
    "can be increased by @xmath81 .",
    "it is worth noting that this will affect the gf and wbf contribution almost identically ( this is the reason why we choose to plot wbf and gf as separate samples in fig .",
    "[ fig:14bkg ] ) .    in order to gain a better handle on the gf distributions we can relax the @xmath76 cut such that the event is not forced into a wbf - type topology . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjj14 ] , we also show distributions for @xmath82 .",
    "as expected , the difference in the wbf / gf samples is now more pronounced in @xmath83 .",
    "the irreducible @xmath84 background grows by approximately a factor of two while the gluon fusion and weak boson fusion cross sections are @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is an increase by factors @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively , compared to the @xmath89 selection .",
    "we find similar wbf / gf separation properties as in fig .",
    "[ fig : llhr14 ] .",
    "note that the irreducible background grows disproportionally , and a signal vs.  background enhancement will vitally depend on a good @xmath0 discriminator , which is exactly provided by @xmath90 .",
    "exclusive number of jets distribution for lhc 8 tev . ]",
    "we can straightforwardly adopt the strategy of sec .  [",
    "sec : meme ] to the current 8 tev setup .",
    "the atlas selection for the two jet category of the @xmath91 search is as follows @xcite : we cluster anti-@xmath47 jets @xcite with @xcite for @xmath92 and select at least two jets with @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the more forward region @xmath95 .",
    "the hardest jets are required to have a rapidity gap @xmath96 and the dijet system has to recoil against the diphoton system in the transverse plane @xmath97 .",
    "again as in sec .",
    "[ sec:14tev ] we require a higgs mass reconstruction within 20 gev interval centered around @xmath57 .    the exclusive number of jets for this selection is again shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nj8 ] ; and we find agreement of our analysis with the experiment s quoted number of 3 expected events in @xmath98 .",
    "obviously , there is again no need to go beyond @xmath72 .",
    "finally we again analyze the potential @xmath0 improvement ( where @xmath99 refers to the irreducible background for our purposes ) , which is the key limiting factor when dealing with the small event rates for the 8 tev run .",
    "[ fig8tev_result ] shows a similar behavior as fig .",
    "[ fig:14bkg ] , we infer that we can at least gain a factor of @xmath100 in @xmath0 without cutting into the signal count in the currently applied selection .",
    "all remarks of the 14 tev results generalize to the lower energy of 8 tev , and again the gf and wbf signals rates are affected identically by selecting events according to @xmath101 .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the matrix element method to @xmath102 production and investigated the prospects to separate the gf and wbf contributions .",
    "this is of utmost importance for @xmath3  analyses of the newly discovered particle , as well as for the measurement of its couplings to known matter .",
    "the same method can be applied to other decay modes of the higgs boson , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath103 .",
    "we find that the matrix element method provides an excellent discriminator , which is stable against finite detector resolution effects and event generation systematics .",
    "we have extended wbf / gf separation to signal vs.  ( irreducible ) background discrimination an find promising results .",
    "wbf / gf separation and enhanced signal vs.  background discrimination can be achieved simultaneously .",
    "our results are directly relevant for the current 2-jet category of @xmath30 analysis , improving the sensitivity to the signal over the irreducible @xmath104 background by @xmath105 , thus leading to a potential sensitivity increase by 35% when reducible backgrounds are considered unaltered .",
    "selection strategies which are based on @xmath107 in a experimentally realistic analysis will allow to measure higgs properties to better precision than currently foreseen .",
    "the implementation of the method will become publicly available to the experiments .",

    "<S> after the recent discovery of a standard model higgs boson - like particle at the lhc , the question of its couplings to known and unknown matter is eminent . in this letter , we present a method that allows for an enhancement in @xmath0(irreducible ) of the order of 100% in @xmath1 for a center of mass energy of 8 and 14 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by applying the matrix element method . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of detector resolution effects and various approximations of the involved event simulation and reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element method provides a reliable , stable , and efficient handle to separate signal from background , and the gluon and weak boson fusion components involved in this process . employing this method , </S>",
    "<S> a more precise higgs boson coupling extraction can be obtained , and our results are of immediate relevance for current searches . </S>"
