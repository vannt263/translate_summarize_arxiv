    "incorporation of quantum optical effects is a necessary and interesting extension of active ongoing research on multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves in random media @xcite .",
    "it becomes particularly important when the medium is active , as is the case in experimentally realized `` random lasers '' @xcite .",
    "quantum effects have been largely ignored in many publications devoted to propagation in disordered amplifying waveguides @xcite , in which only amplified stimulated emission of external incoming flux but not of spontaneously emitted internal noise was taken into account ( ref .",
    "being a notable exception ) .",
    "amplified internal noise can lead to excitation of low - threshold lasing modes of the waveguide , making practical use of amplifying waveguides problematic .",
    "the difficulty of the waveguide geometry is the onset of localization . in this paper",
    "we consider a simpler cavity geometry , which does not show localization , but retains two essential features of the problem : large sample - to - sample fluctuations and spontaneous emission .",
    "a complete description of the fluctuations is possible in the universal regime characterized by a chaotic pattern of classical trajectories .",
    "we assume that the cavity ( volume @xmath6 ) is confined by conducting walls , filled with a lasing medium ( central frequency of the gain profile @xmath7 ) , and coupled to external detectors via one or several small holes .",
    "it was demonstrated recently that a non - integrable shape of the resonator can significantly affect its lasing properties @xcite .",
    "chaoticity of classical trajectories can be achieved either by a peculiar shape of the resonator @xcite , or by a small amount of disorder scattering .",
    "we will speak about `` chaotic cavities , '' meaning any of the two mechanisms responsible for the onset of chaos .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of well - resolved cavity modes , which means that 1 ) resistive loss @xmath8 in the cavity walls is less than the mean modal spacing @xmath9 , 2 ) characteristic size of the holes @xmath10 is smaller than the wavelength @xmath11 .",

    "this regime is experimentally accessible , as was demonstrated by a recent series of experiments on microwave cavities with superconducting niobium walls @xcite .",
    "each act of spontaneous emission in a pumped cavity is a source of radiation into some cavity mode .",
    "classical condition of the lasing threshold in a given cavity mode is satisfied if the gain due to stimulated emission equals the loss .",
    "threshold for the cavity is the smallest value of the pumping rate at which threshold is attained for one of the modes .",
    "the questions we ask are : what is the threshold rate of pumping ?",
    "how many lasing modes can coexist for a given pumping rate above the threshold ?",
    "the problem of spectral content of outgoing radiation has been widely studied for integrable cavities of definite shape . considering arrays of chaotic cavities of slightly varying shape or with different configurations of scatterers we address the problem statistically and",
    "compute the probability of lasing , the distribution of the threshold , and the average number of excited modes .",
    "trivially , gain greater than mean loss @xmath12 will be on the average sufficient to ensure lasing , while gain smaller than @xmath8 will never suffice .",
