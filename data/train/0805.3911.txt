    "the present experimental world average of the branching ratio of @xmath2 , which includes measurements by cleo , babar and belle @xcite , is performed by the heavy flavor averaging group @xcite and , for photon energies @xmath3 , is given by @xmath4 where the errors are combined statistical and systematic and due to the extrapolation to the common lower - cut in the photon energy , respectively .",
    "moreover , the total uncertainty , being already below 7% , is expected to reduce down to 5% at the end of the b - factory era .    in order to keep pace with the improving experimental accuracy the theoretical prediction of the @xmath2 branching ratio has to be known at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) level . a first estimate of the @xmath2 branching ratio at this level of accuracy has been presented in @xcite . for @xmath5gev it reads @xmath6 this estimate includes the three - loop dipole operator matching conditions @xcite , the three - loop mixing of the four - quark operators @xcite , the three - loop mixing of the dipole operators @xcite , and the four - loop mixing of the four - quark operators into the dipole operators @xcite .",
    "also the two - loop matrix elements of the electromagnetic dipole operator together with the corresponding bremsstrahlung terms ( at @xmath7 ) @xcite , as well as the three - loop matrix elements of the four - quark operators within the so - called large-@xmath8 approximation @xcite have been taken into account .",
    "finally , in order to obtain estimates of these matrix elements ( together with other still unknown ones ) at the physical value of the charm quark mass @xmath9 an interpolation in the latter has been performed in @xcite .",
    "we should mention here that there are several perturbative and non - perturbative effects that have not been considered when deriving the estimate given in ( [ estimate ] ) .",
    "some of them are already available in the literature : the four - loop mixing of @xmath10 into @xmath11 @xcite ; the bremsstrahlung contributions of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14-interference at @xmath15 @xcite ; the exact charm quark mass dependence of the @xmath16-interference at @xmath1 @xcite ; the three - loop virtual corrections due to charm and bottom quark loop insertions into gluon propagators in the @xmath17 and @xmath13-interference @xcite ; the updated knowledge of the semileptonic normalization factor @xcite ; photon energy cut - off related effects @xcite ; and estimates for the @xmath18 corrections @xcite .",
    "other effects are unknown at the moment , like the complete virtual and bremsstrahlung contributions to the @xmath14 and @xmath19-interference at @xmath1 ( only the contribution of the @xmath14-interference at @xmath20 is known @xcite ) , and of course the exact @xmath9-dependence of various matrix elements beyond the large-@xmath8 approximation , in order to improve ( or even remove ) the uncertainty due to the interpolation in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the individual contributions listed above are all expected to remain within the uncertainty given in ( [ estimate ] ) , nevertheless they should be taken into account in future updates .    in the present paper",
    "we repeat the calculation of the @xmath14-interference contribution performed in @xcite and extend it to include not only the effects of massless quark loops but also those due to massive ones .",
    "more precisely , we calculate those @xmath1 contributions which can be obtained from the feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath14-interference at @xmath21 when dressing the gluon propagators with massless up , down and strange quark loops as well as with massive charm and bottom quark loops .",
    "we work out the effects of these contributions to the photon energy spectrum @xmath22 and to the total decay width @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the cut in the photon energy .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our final results for the total decay width and the photon energy spectrum and describe briefly the calculation of the relevant feynman diagrams .",
    "the numerical impact of the fermionic corrections on @xmath25 is estimated in section 3 .",
    "finally , we summarize in section 4 .",
    "within the low - energy effective theory the partonic @xmath26 decay rate can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the pole and the running @xmath30 mass of the @xmath31 quark , respectively , @xmath32 the effective wilson coefficients at the low - energy scale , and @xmath24 the energy cut in the photon spectrum .",

    "all powers of a sum of several terms could be replaced by one- or two - fold mellin - barnes integrals which made the integration over the feynman parameters trivial . finally , we closed the integration contours @xmath97 sidewards by a half - circle with infinite radius and summed up the enclosed residues . in our case",
    "all infinite sums involving the mass ratio @xmath101 could be reduced to the inverse binomial sums given in @xcite , and we obtained solutions for all two - loop integrals which are valid for arbitrary values of @xmath101 .",

    "the last check concerns the asymptotic behavior for @xmath112 . in this limit",

    "they differ from the ones shown in the left frame by adding the contributions from the 3- and 4-particle cuts , with the latter depending on the ( rescaled ) photon energy cutoff @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical value we chose in this illustration is given by @xmath123 and corresponds to @xmath124gev . as seen , the main effect of the bremsstrahlung corrections is to shift the function for @xmath116 ( red solid line ) and @xmath106 ( black dotted curve ) down by a factor of about 1.7 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "also the aforementioned logarithmic singularity for @xmath106 can be observed for @xmath108 .",
    "there is no shift for @xmath107 ( blue dashed line ) since we set @xmath125 equal to @xmath28 in our illustration ( see ( [ yz0nh ] ) ) .",
    "we remark that other values for the renormalization scale @xmath125 than @xmath28 lead merely to a shift of the three curves plotted in the left frame of figure [ plot ] by the same amount up or down .",
    "the reason for this is that the three quantities given in ( [ y2cutsnl])([y2cutsnv ] ) have exactly the same @xmath125-dependence .",
    "the same comment is also true for the three curves shown in the right frame of figure [ plot ] , as can be seen from ( [ y0nl])([yz0nv ] ) .",
    "however , it is clear that a variation of @xmath125 will change the relative importance with which each individual contribution enters the function @xmath33 .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath126 leads to @xmath127 , and hence the fermionic corrections will be dominated by the two functions with @xmath116 and @xmath106 . on the other hand , for smaller values of @xmath125 than @xmath28 the situation can be reversed .",
    "next , we compare the fermionic corrections at nnlo with the nlo result . using the numerical values @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( for the other input parameters we use the same values as before )",
    ", we find @xmath132 where the two numbers after the first equality sign correspond to the @xmath21 and the fermionic @xmath1 contributions given in ( [ g77_exp ] ) , and the ellipses denote the still unknown @xmath1 terms proportional to @xmath46 and @xmath47 as well as higher order corrections . thus , at @xmath133 , the effect of the nnlo fermionic corrections is to lower the nlo value of @xmath134 by around 10% . for @xmath135 and @xmath136gev , the @xmath21 term in @xmath33",
    "changes to 0.009 and 0.124 , respectively , and the @xmath1 correction shifts these values by around 3% and -11% , respectively .    finally , we estimate the effect of the fermionic corrections at @xmath1 on the branching ratio of @xmath0 . as seen in figure [ plot ] , the contributions with massive charm quark loops ( @xmath106 ) at the physical value @xmath120 are of comparable size as those with massless quarks in the loops ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "hence , the charm quark mass effects can with good accuracy be described by a single massless quark entering the large-@xmath8 approximation . on the other hand , approximating the contributions due to massive bottom quark loops ( @xmath107 ) by massless ones is not very accurate ( see figure [ plot ] ) . here",
    ", however , one should bear in mind that in the physical application we have three massless and only two massive quarks .",
    "that is the leading correction to @xmath25 will be given by the sum of the contributions with @xmath137 and @xmath138 , where the former is weighted by a factor of three , and the correction due to the contribution with @xmath139 will only appear at the subleading level .",
    "in fact , the exact result of the fermionic corrections at @xmath133 can be accurately approximated by setting @xmath140 and @xmath141 in ( [ colorf ] ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the massive bottom quark loops at @xmath133 can be accounted for in the large-@xmath8 approximation by reducing the number of massless quark flavors by -0.4 .",
    "given that the large-@xmath8 corrections of the @xmath14-interference affect the branching ratio of @xmath0 by around 0.7% for @xmath133 , we conclude that this will not be altered drastically when implementing the exact results for the fermionic corrections with massive quarks .",
    "corrections in the @xmath14-interference on the branching ratio of @xmath0 stays below 1% when varying @xmath125 between 1.25gev and 5gev . ] we remark here that for other values of the renormalization scale @xmath125 than @xmath28 it happens that the exact result can only be approximated by the massless contribution when using a negative number of massless quark flavors .",
    "for example , for @xmath142 , the exact result can be approximated by setting @xmath143 and @xmath141 in ( [ colorf ] ) .",
    "determining the effect of the new fermionic corrections on @xmath25 in this case would require to repeat the interpolation procedure performed in @xcite .",
    "since we expect that it will also be 1% at most ( when combining large-@xmath8 and massive quark loop corrections ) , that is below the total uncertainty given in ( [ estimate ] ) , we postpone this to a forthcoming analysis which will also include other contributions not considered so far .",
    "in this paper we calculated the nnlo fermionic corrections to the total decay rate and the photon energy spectrum induced by the interference of the electro- and chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "we confirmed the results for the @xmath15 terms given in @xcite and also presented analytical results for the contributions with massive bottom and charm quark loops .",
