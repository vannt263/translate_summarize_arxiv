    "<S> we investigate the quantum teleportation between a conformal detector alice and an inertial detector bob in de sitter space in two schemes , ( i ) one uses free scalar modes and ( ii ) one utilizes cavity to store qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fidelity of the teleportation is degraded for bob in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> while the fidelity - loss is due to the gibbons - hawking effect associated with his cosmological horizon in the scheme ( i ) , the entanglement decreases in the scheme ( ii ) because the ability to entangle the cavities is reduced by the spacetime curvature . with a cutoff at planck - scale , comparing with the standard bunch - davies choice , we also show that the possible planckian physics cause extra modifications to the fidelity of the teleportation protocol in both schemes . </S>",
    "<S> +    one of the main challenges in modern physics is to find a complete theory of quantum gravity which merges quantum mechanics and general relativity into a unified framework . </S>",
    "<S> evidences from some candidate theories ( e.g. string theory ) have shown @xcite that typical quantum gravitational phenomena should be a unitary process . </S>",
    "<S> this however conflicts with the semiclassical analysis that predict the information loss during the process . to resolve this paradox , </S>",
    "<S> it has become increasingly clear @xcite that non - locality , the basic feature of quantum information theory , should be employed . </S>",
    "<S> this indeed allows one to understand some quantum gravitational effects in a quantum - information framework . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a new fast growing field called relativistic quantum information ( rqi ) ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) has shed new light on this issue . </S>",
    "<S> the insight from rqi is the novel observer - dependent character of quantum correlations like entanglement . for a bipartite entangled system in flat space , this means @xcite an accelerated observer would experience decrement of quantum entanglement he shares initially with an inertial partner due to the celebrated unruh effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such kind of environmental decoherence has later been generalized to curved background @xcite . for a static observer nearby the black hole , </S>",
    "<S> a degradation of quantum correlations provoked by hawking radiation from event horizon would be detected . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement produced in the formation of a black hole has also been studied and provides a quantum information resource between the field modes falling into the black hole and those radiated to infinity . by imposing proper final - state boundary conditions at the singularity @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this non - locality could transmit information outside the event horizon via a teleportation - like process and restore the unitarity of black hole evaporation process . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it has been emphasized @xcite that even the standard teleportation protocol @xcite is highly non - trivial in the rqi framework . in </S>",
    "<S> flat space , as a result of entanglement degradation , the fidelity of a teleportation process would also suffer a reduction for an observer with uniform acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , quantum teleportation process in a black hole background was also investigated @xcite and it was shown that the fidelity is considerably reduced for the fixed observer near the horizon . an analogues experiment using sonic black hole is proposed @xcite to test this phenomenon in a suitable laboratory setting .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a quantum teleportation process in de sitter space , which idealizes the inflation epoch of early universe and plays a fundamental role in quantum gravity theory ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a protocol to teleport an unknown qubit @xmath0 from a conformal observer alice to her inertial partner bob while they initially share a bell state . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we investigate two schemes of our protocol , ( i ) one using free scalar modes from which a qubit can be truncated @xcite , and ( ii ) another scheme utilizing moving cavities to store the field modes related with respective observers .    in the scheme ( i ) , unlike the standard teleportation protocol , we will show that the decoherence , provoked by the gibbons - hawking effect associated with bob s cosmological horizon @xcite , would reduce the fidelity of the teleportation process . </S>",
    "<S> while de sitter space provide the best scenario to the so - called trans - planck problem @xcite , we also discuss its influence on our teleportation scheme from the existence of some fundamental scales ( like planckian or even stringy ) . with a cutoff on physical momentum of field mode at planck - scale , comparing with the standard bunch - davies choice , we calculate the extra modifications to the fidelity of the teleportation process from the possible high - energy new physics .    in the scheme ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> , since the field modes are localized in cavities by the reflecting mirrors , the entanglement between the cavities could be protected from the degradation once it has been prepared @xcite . however , as we will show that , even using of localized cavity states could save the protocol from the gibbons - hawking radiation , the ability to entangle the different cavity mode is still decreased by the curvature of spacetime , that results a similar qualitatively dependence as in ( i ) between the fidelity and the hubble parameter @xmath1 .    to proceed , we first recall the thermal feature of quantum field theory in de sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> consider the mode expansion of a free scalar field in de sitter space @xmath2 \\label{modeboson}\\ ] ] the vacuum state , which respects the spacetime isometries , is defined by @xmath3 . to specify the mode functions @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate systems affiliated to different observers should be employed prior to solve the field equation .    </S>",
    "<S> a conformal observer in de sitter space adopts the planar coordinates which reduce the spacetime metric to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is conformal time , and the coordinates cover the upper right triangle of the carter - penrose diagram ( both regions i and ii ) , as depicted in fig.[telep - ds ] .     </S>",
    "<S> ( or the entanglement decrease during entangling cavities ) , the fidelity of teleporting a qubit @xmath7 would be suppressed . ]    </S>",
    "<S> since the space undergoes an accelerated expansion , it follows that the wavelength of field mode could become arbitrarily small if one goes backwards in @xmath8 long enough , where any distinction between de sitter space and minkowski space could be safely ignored . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an essentially unique bunch - davies vacuum @xmath9 could be defined , by requesting it approaching the conformal vacuum of minkowski space in the limit @xmath10 .    however , the existence of the fundamental scales , where the quantum gravitational effects become unignorable , prevents us from following a mode back unlimited ( or equivalently , to the arbitrary short distance ) @xcite . imposing a reasonable cutoff on physical momentum as @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the latest time with quantum gravity dominant is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 refers to the planck energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> this results a modified vacuum state of the conformal observer as @xmath14 , which is in general different from the bunch - davies choice and could be formally realized as a squeezed state @xmath15 where the superscript @xmath16 indicates the bunch - davies choice and throughout . without a complete theory of quantum gravity , </S>",
    "<S> this new vacuum of conformal observer can provide a typical signature of planck - scale physics . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it was shown ( see @xcite and the references therein ) that the inflation power spectrum @xmath17 with respect to the new vacuum would be modified as @xmath18 , which is expected to be observed in the wmap or planck satellite experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> more ambitious view is that above argument indeed provides a one - parameter family of vacua with the @xmath13 predicted by various quantum gravity theories , e.g. an energy scale interpolated between planckian and stringy scales . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , this leads the so - called @xmath19-vacua which have been known for a long time @xcite .    introducing the new mode basis related to the bunch - davies one by the mottola - allen ( ma ) transformation @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is an arbitrary complex number with re@xmath21 , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the one - parameter family of vacua is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 \\label{maboson}\\ ] ] are the corresponding annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath19-vacua preserve all @xmath25 de sitter isometries , and clearly include the bunch - davies vacuum as one element since @xmath26 if re@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the condition ( [ bc2 ] ) can now be explicitly resolved as |0^_k=|0^_k[bcboson ]    in a realistic model , the value of @xmath19 could be strictly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> first , for a theory consistent with @xmath28-invariance , @xmath19 should be real . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , we henceforth adopt @xmath29re@xmath19 for simplicity . on the other hand , rather than the bunch - davies choice , </S>",
    "<S> if a non - trivial @xmath19-state ( @xmath30 ) is chosen as an alternative initial state of inflation , the modified power spectrum of inflationary perturbations requires that @xcite @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown @xcite that the vacuum state defined by the conformal observer would be nonempty in the view of a static observer . </S>",
    "<S> while the bunch - davies vacuum appears thermal with the gibbons - hawking temperature @xmath32 , it is clear that these @xmath19-vacua would exhibit non - thermal feature encoding the quantum gravitational corrections .    in terms of the static coordinates , </S>",
    "<S> de sitter metric becomes ds^2=(1-r^2h^2)dt^2-(1-r^2h^2)^-1dr^2-r^2d^2 [ static ] where @xmath33 is the cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates only cover the region i in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ telep - ds ] , half of the planar coordinates dose . </S>",
    "<S> the hypersurface on @xmath34 is a cosmological horizon for an observer situated at @xmath35 . since the existence of the killing vector @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , a static vacuum @xmath37 could be defined unambiguously . to analyze the thermality of this vacuum , we employ the particular useful painlev coordinates @xcite , which reduce the metric ( [ confmetric ] ) into ds^2=(1-h^2r^2)dt^2 + 2hrdrdt-dr^2-r^2d^2 covering both regions i and ii , and @xmath38 , admitting the same killing vector as in ( [ static ] ) throughout the whole space but change its character from timelike to spacelike upon passing through the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the most attractive feature that we utilized is that the coordinates admit the same bunch - davies vacuum , while the out - state can be split into a tensor product @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , after tracing over the degrees in region ii unaccessible for the static observer in region i. denoting by @xmath41 and @xmath42 the particle annihilation operators in regions i and ii , we can relate them with those in the conformal framework by the bogoliubov transformations a^_k = r </S>",
    "<S> a_k^i - r a_-k^ii [ bogoboson ] with the squeezing operator @xmath43 $ ] , the bunch - davies vacuum for the conformal observer can be realized as a squeezed state in the view of inertial observer    @xmath44 obtained from the gibbons - hawking effect . </S>",
    "<S> this means that particles are created in pairs on either side of event horizon , and only the one in region i could be detected as de sitter radiation by an inertial observer .    for the general @xmath19-vacua </S>",
    "<S> , deviations from thermality should be included . from ( [ bcboson ] ) and ( [ bogoboson ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that    @xmath27 , these corrections can be neglected and a pure thermal de sitter radiation associated with the bunch - davies choice is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> the one - particle excitation in @xmath19-vacua can also be obtained as     we now investigate our teleportation protocol in de sitter space . as stated in the introduction , the scheme ( i ) of the protocol </S>",
    "<S> utilizes the free field modes with infinite levels , from which a a qubit can be truncated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we work with so - called dual rail encoding which is used in linear - optical quantum computing schemes and the experimental scheme of quantum teleportation protocol @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the bipartite system contains two conformal observers alice and bob , sharing a bell state when they coincide . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that each one supports two orthogonal modes , with the same frequency , labelled @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 , the total state of alice and bob encodes a two - qubit bell state    @xmath48 , @xmath49 , with similar expression for bob . </S>",
    "<S> here the superscript @xmath19 indicates a general choice of vacuum state with cutoff at certain fundamental scales in de sitter space .    after their coincidence , we suppose bob becomes inertial while alice maintains her comoving motion with respect to conformal time @xmath8 . as we analyzed before , for the inertial observer bob , the vacuum state chosen by alice becomes thermal and can be written as the two - mode squeezed states ( [ bosealpha ] ) and ( [ onealpha ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> to establish a teleportation protocol between alice and bob , which means to teleport an unknown state from conformal detector alice to now inertial detector bob , alice possesses an additional qubit @xmath50 in dual - rail basis . </S>",
    "<S> the input state to system is then @xmath51 , which can be expanded in the bell basis associated with cavities @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> if alice makes a joint projective measurement on her two logical qubits with the result @xmath54 , the full state could be projected into |=(|i|j)_ac|_ij_b where bob s state is    @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . depending on the results of measurement @xmath59 sent from alice by classical channel </S>",
    "<S> , bob can recover the unknown state by applying a proper unitary transformation on his qubit and complete the protocol in his local frame . </S>",
    "<S> the main point is , such a teleportation process in de sitter space should be indeed influenced by the local gibbons - hawking radiation detected by bob . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , additional modification from the existence of minimal fundamental scale should also be taken into account if one starts from general conformal vacuum like ( [ bosealpha ] ) rather than the bunch - davies choice .    </S>",
    "<S> the way to probe the deviations of our scheme from the standard teleportation process in flat space is to calculate the fidelity of the teleported state of bob . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that alice should not yet cross bob s event horizon at @xmath60 when she sends her measurement result out , otherwise bob would never receive it via a classical channel . </S>",
    "<S> since bob has no access to field modes beyond his cosmological horizon , his state would be projected into a mixed one by tracing over the states in region ii . from ( [ bosealpha ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> ( [ onealpha ] ) and ( [ cstate ] ) we have & & _ ij^i=_k , l=0^  _ iik , l|_ij_b_ij|k , l_ii + & & = ( 1-^2r^2)^3_n=0^_m=0^n[bobstate ] which can also be written in block diagonal form as @xmath61 , with the coefficients p_0&=&0  ,  p_1=(1-^2r^2)^3 , + p_n&=&(^2r^2)^n-1(1-^2r^2)^3    it should be emphasized that , by applying a proper unitary operation , bob can only turn his state ( [ bobstate ] ) into a region i analogue of the unknown state from alice , like @xmath62 , expanded in the restricted rail basis @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation from the standard teleportation protocol can be measured by the fidelity defined as f^i_i(|_i_i|^i)=_i|^i|_i=(1-^2r^2)^3 [ fidelity ] which indicates the probability that the bob s state @xmath64 will pass a test to identify it as the desired teleported state @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> recall the relation @xmath44 and ( [ bosoncorrec ] ) , above result can be depicted as in fig.[fidelity - ds ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    our first observation is that , the fidelity of the teleportation process in de sitter space is closely related to the hubble parameter @xmath1 ( or the curvature radius @xmath65 of spacetime ) . as we demonstrated before , this phenomenon roots from the information loss via de sitter radiation detected by inertial observer bob , similar to the unruh effect for accelerated frame in flat space or hawking radiation from black hole . </S>",
    "<S> for the bunch - davies state which has @xmath66 with pure thermal spectrum , we could reach an conclusion compatible to the remarkable results of @xcite where the hubble parameter @xmath1 is replaced by the acceleration of the unruh detector or the surface gravity of black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also observe that , if one consider the possible cutoff at fundamental scales , the resulting quantum gravitational effect could be encoded in the pattern of fidelity evolution for our teleportation scheme . comparing with the standard bunch - davies choice , the fidelity is suppressed for all @xmath19-vacua choice with @xmath30 . in a realistic model @xcite with @xmath67gev and @xmath68gev </S>",
    "<S> , the typical value of @xmath19 can be estimated to be @xmath69 . by proper tuning of the remaining parameters , </S>",
    "<S> this choice could result in a significantly modification in the degradation pattern of fidelity for bob .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the scheme ( ii ) which utilizes cavity to store the qubit for each observer . </S>",
    "<S> the reflecting mirrors impose the boundary conditions on the field , which result a localized mode restricted inside the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> while the exact solutions of field equation in curved background are highly involved , for simplicity , we demonstrate our model in a 2-dimensional de sitter space .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume alice possesses cavity @xmath52 described in ( [ confmetric ] ) with two mirrors position at @xmath70 and the length @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution for the scalar field equation @xmath72 which satisfied the dirichlet boundaries @xmath73 is ^_a , k(,z)=n_ah^(2)_(k_n)realizing the bunch - davies vacuum , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the hankel function with the order @xmath76 . the further simplification could be made for ignoring the tiny mass , then a general mode related with @xmath19-vacua is^_a , k(,z)=(e^-ik_n+e^e^ik_n ) [ bdsolution ]    similarly , the localized mode in bob s cavity @xmath77 situated at @xmath78 could be solved in static coordinates by the hypergeometric function @xcite . within the same limitation </S>",
    "<S> , we have _ b , k(t , r)=e^-ik_nt [ staticsolution ] where @xmath79 and the static vacuum has been admitted . by the transformations between different charts ( [ confmetric ] ) and ( [ static ] ) = -,z = r [ atomcoordtransf ] the cavities length in different observers view could be related by @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> since we assume perfectly reflecting mirrors , the field modes inside a cavity are protected and the detector should not be kicked @xcite . as the resource for quantum information tasks , </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement between the cavities now should be maintained once it was prepared . by this meaning </S>",
    "<S> , the teleportation protocol could be saved from hawking radiation . </S>",
    "<S> however , since entangling cavities is a very non - trivial process in curved background , the ability to prepare the entangled state between alice and bob would result a curvature - dependence in protocol .    </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the robust scheme in flat space @xcite to prepare the entangling cavities in the curved de sitter background , which employees a two - level excited atom , passing through cavities @xmath52 and @xmath77 in their ground states . </S>",
    "<S> after subsequently measurement on the atom , a photon has been emitted into one of the cavities if the atom is found in its ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the atom and cavity modes is described by the hamiltonian _ </S>",
    "<S> i=()[_a()_a(x())+_b()_b(x ( ) ) ] where @xmath81 is atom s proper time and the monopole operator is @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the switching functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 model the effective interaction time for the atom passes through the length of cavity . by mode functions ( [ bdsolution ] ) , ( [ staticsolution ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the final entangled state between alice and bob s cavities can be given    & = & _ k(c_a^_k+c_b^i_k)|0_a^|0^s_b + & = & _ k(c_a|1_a^|0^s_b+c_b|0_a^|1^s_b ) [ entangling ] which depends on the spacetime curvature in terms of @xmath1 , and clearly is not a maximally entangled state as ( [ maxentg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> once the entangled state is prepared , same local measurements could be made as in scheme ( i ) . however , while the localized cavity states have been protected from the gibbons - hawking radiation , the degradation of entanglement during entangling cavity results an imperfect teleported state for bob , similar as ( [ cstate ] ) but with the coefficients @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the fidelity loss in this scheme depends on our ability in preparing the entangled state .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the planckian modification has been included in the possibility amplitude @xmath89 . to calculate it , </S>",
    "<S> we specify the atom s trajectory , @xmath90 in conformal coordinates , and can be expressed in the static coordinates as @xmath91 , -\\frac{z}{h\\tau}\\big ) $ ] , where @xmath92 is the spatial location of the atom . for alice s cavity , </S>",
    "<S> we choose a gaussian - like switching function @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denotes the time that atom passing through the cavity center , and @xmath95 depends on both the cavity geometry and the atom s transverse velocity . from ( [ bdsolution ] ) , ( [ entangling ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we have c_a&=&-iw n_a ( ) + & & + where @xmath96 . as @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> the bunch - davies choice is recovered , a counterpart of the remarkable results in flat space @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the fidelity loss of a teleportation protocol in de sitter space is unavoidable , either due to the gibbons - hawking radiation in scheme ( i ) , or the imperfection in entangling different cavities in scheme ( ii ) . with a cutoff at planck scale , </S>",
    "<S> the possible planckian physics cause some extra modification on the fidelity in both schemes of our teleportation protocol .    since the important role of planck - scale physics in early universe </S>",
    "<S> , we hope that those discussions on the rqi process in cosmological background @xcite may shed some light on our understanding of quantum fluctuation decoherence during / after inflation . </S>",
    "<S> even it takes a certain amount of foolhardiness to do that directly , we can at least simulate these planckian modifications by analogue gravity experiments , like using ion trap . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in detector picture @xcite , to simulate planckian modification , the detector s response function represents the probability for an ion excited by interaction with the field . the ion analogue of the wightman function @xmath97 should be evaluated in some motional - state@xcite , since the @xmath19-vacua can be interpreted as squeezed states over the bunch - davies vacuum state . </S>"
