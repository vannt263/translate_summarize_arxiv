    "a summary of the main features and conclusions of the results of this section is presented in table 1 .",
    "further details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the physical properties ( energy , pressure ) of a gas of circular strings in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes . in static coordinates , we thus consider the spacetimes : @xmath122 for simplicity we consider the string dynamics in a 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "all our solutions can however be embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , where they will describe plane circular strings .",
    "we are interested in the three cases : @xmath123 the equations describing the evolution of circular strings are : @xmath124 @xmath125 and generalize eqs.(2.2)-(2.3 ) .    properties like energy and pressure of the strings are more conveniently discussed in comoving ( cosmological ) coordinates : @xmath126 including as special cases minkowski , de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes : @xmath127 the spacetime energy - momentum tensor is given in @xmath0 dimensions by : @xmath128 after integration over a spatial volume that completely encloses the string @xcite , the energy - momentum tensor for a circular string takes the form of a fluid : @xmath129 where , in the comoving coordinates ( 3.4 ) : @xmath130 @xmath131 represent the string energy and pressure , respectively .",
    "we have already described all the circular string solutions in de sitter spacetime , section 2 .",
    "the circular string solutions in anti de sitter spacetime were obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the general solution is : @xmath132,\\ ] ] where : @xmath133 for arbitrary values of the elliptic modulus @xmath134 , the solution describes one oscillating string .",
    "let us now return to the energy - momentum tensor for circular strings .",
    "the circular string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes depend on the elliptic modulus @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , as we have seen . from these exact solutions we find the corresponding energy - momentum tensors .",
    "they turn out to have the perfect fluid form with an equation of state : @xmath137 where @xmath19 in general is time - dependent and depends on the elliptic modulus ( @xmath138 or @xmath136 ) as well .",
    "we have analyzed the equation of state , eq.(3.11 ) , for all circular string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , ref.@xcite .    in de sitter spacetime , for strings expanding from zero radius towards infinity , the equation of state changes continuosly from the ultra - relativistic matter - type @xmath139 ( in @xmath0 dimensions )",
    "when @xmath140 to the unstable string - type @xcite , @xmath141 when @xmath142 see fig.4 .",
    "on the other hand , for an oscillating stable string in de sitter spacetime , @xmath19 oscillates between @xmath143 and @xmath144 where @xmath145.$ ] averaging over one oscillation period , the pressure _ vanishes _ @xcite .",
    "that is , these stable string solutions actually describe ( in average ) _ cold matter_. see also fig.5 .    in anti de sitter spacetime , only the oscillating ( stable )",
    "circular string solutions , eq.(3.9 ) , exist .",
    "we find that @xmath19 oscillates between @xmath143 and @xmath146 i.e. the equation of state `` oscillates '' between @xmath147 and @xmath148 this is similar to the situation in flat minkowski spacetime . when averaging over an oscillation period in anti de sitter spacetime , we find that @xmath19 takes values from @xmath149 to @xmath150 for the allowed range of the elliptic modulus .",
    "that is , the average pressure over one oscillation period is always _ positive _ in anti de sitter spacetime .    in conclusion",
    ", positive pressure characterizes the regime in which the string radius is small relative to the string maximal size , while negative pressure is characteristic for the regime in which the string radius is large . in minkowski spacetime ,",
    "the two regimes are of equal `` size '' , in the sense that the average pressure is identically zero .",
    "the influence of the spacetime curvature is among other effects , to modify the relative `` size '' of the two regimes .",
    "a summary of these features are presented in table 2 .",
    "more details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we perform a semi - classical quantization of the circular string configurations discussed in the previous sections .",
    "we use an approach developed in field theory by dashen et .",
    "@xcite , based on the stationary phase approximation of the partition function .",
    "the method can be only used for time - periodic solutions of the classical equations of motion . in our string problem , these solutions however , include all the circular string solutions in minkowski and in anti de sitter spacetimes , as well as the oscillating circular strings ( @xmath151 c.f .",
    "section 2 ) in de sitter spacetime .",
    "the result of the stationary phase integration is expressed in terms of the function : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the action of the classical solution , @xmath154 is the mass and the period @xmath155 is implicitly given by : @xmath156 in string theory we must choose @xmath27 to be the period in a physical time variable .",
    "for example , when a light cone gauge exists , @xmath27 is the period in @xmath157 the bound state quantization condition then becomes @xcite : @xmath158 for @xmath11 ` large ' .",
    "the method has been successfully used in many cases from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory . for integrable field theories",
    "the semi - classical quantization happens in fact , to be exact .",
    "it must be noticed that string theory in de sitter spacetime is exactly integrable @xcite .",
    "the actual computation of @xmath159 is straightforward but tedious ; the details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for completeness we first considered flat minkowski spacetime . in that case , eq.(4.3 ) reproduces the exact mass spectrum , except for the intercept .",
    "that is , the mass spectrum becomes @xmath160    we find for de sitter ( anti de sitter ) spacetime that the mass is exactly proportional to the square - root of the casimir operator @xmath161 of the @xmath3-de sitter [ @xmath4-anti de sitter ] group : @xmath162 in fig.6 we give parametric plots of @xmath163 as a function of @xmath164 for @xmath145 $ ] for de sitter spacetime and for @xmath165 for anti de sitter spacetime , respectively .",
    "we find for de sitter spacetime : @xmath166 this is different from the mass spectrum in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the level spacing is however still approximately constant , but the levels are less separated than in minkowski spacetime .",
    "notice in particular that the level spacing slightly decreases for larger and larger @xmath167 in de sitter spacetime there is only a _",
    "finite _ number of levels as can be seen from fig.1 .",
    "the number of quantized circular string states can be estimated to be : @xmath168 it is interesting to compare this result with the number of particle states obtained using canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "one finds in this way a maximum number of states : @xmath169 which is of the same order as the semi - classical value eq.(4.6 ) .",
    "it must be noticed that in de sitter spacetime , these states can _ decay _ quantum mechanically due to the possibility of quantum mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier , see fig.1 .",
    "semi - classically , the decay probability is however highly suppressed for @xmath170 and for any value of the elliptic modulus @xmath171 except near @xmath172 where the barrier disappears , and for which the tunneling probability is close to unity , see ref.@xcite .    in anti de sitter spacetime",
    "arbitrary high mass states exist .",
    "the quantization of the high mass states yields ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath173 thus the ( mass)@xmath174 grows like @xmath175 and the level spacing grows proportionally to @xmath167 this is a completely different behaviour as compared to minkowski spacetime where the level spacing is constant .",
    "a similar result was recently found , using canonical quantization of generic strings in anti de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "the physical consequences , especially the non - existence of a critical string temperature ( hagedorn temperature ) , of this kind of behaviour is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .    for both de sitter and anti de sitter",
    "spacetimes we find thus a strong qualitative agreement between the results obtained using canonical quantization , based on generic string solutions ( string perturbation approach ) , and the results obtained using the semi - classical approach , based on oscillating circular string configurations .",
    "a summary of these features are presented in table 3 .",
    "more details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have found the exact general evolution of circular strings in @xmath0 dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "we have expressed it closely and completely in terms of elliptic functions , see ref.@xcite for the details .",
    "the solution generically describes infinitely many ( different and independent ) strings , and depends on one constant parameter @xmath39 ( for fixed @xmath42 ) related to the string energy .",
    "we have computed _ exactly _ the equation of state of the circular string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the string equation of state has the perfect fluid form @xmath18 with @xmath176 and @xmath177 expressed closely and completely in terms of elliptic functions ( see ref.@xcite for the details ) and the instantaneous parameter @xmath19 depending on an elliptic modulus .",
    "we have quantized the time - periodic ( oscillating ) string solutions within the semi - classical ( stationary phase approximation ) approach and found the mass formulas in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the semi - classical quantization of the _ exact _ circular string solutions and the canonical quantization of generic strings ( string perturbation series approach ) , provide the same qualitative results .",
