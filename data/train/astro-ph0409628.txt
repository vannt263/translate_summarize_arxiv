    "surveys in the optical are known to be affected by strong selection effects ( e.g. disney 1976 ; disney & phillipps 1983 ; mcgaugh 1996 ) which bias our understanding of the local galaxy population .",
    "corrections for these selection effects can be made , but these are large and controversial and must be applied to small numbers of sources , leading to large uncertainties ( impey & bothun 1997 ; disney 1999 ) .",
    "low surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies could make a significant contribution to the universe that would not be recognised in an optical survey .",
    "they may dominate the luminosity , baryon or mass density of the galaxies in the universe ( e.g. fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) and could contribute significantly to qso absorption line spectra ( e.g. churchill & le brun 1998 ) .",
    "zwaan et al . ( 2003 ) derived the hi mass function for the 1000 galaxies in the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) bright galaxy catalogue ( koribalski et al .",
    "2004 ) and put a value of 15 per cent on the contribution of lsb galaxies to the neutral hydrogen density of the universe",
    ". however , this number depends crucially on their assumption that optical catalogues are as ( in)complete for lsb galaxies as for high surface - brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "this is obviously not the case as lsb galaxies are much harder to detect than hsb galaxies . indeed , most of the new galaxies , outside of the zone - of - avoidance , found in the hipass bright galaxy catalogue are lsb galaxies ( ryan - weber et al .",
    "thus the value of zwaan et al . should be considered only a lower limit to the contribution of lsb galaxies to the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "the idea of searching for galaxies via the 21-cm neutral hydrogen line has long been considered as an alternative to optical surveys ( e.g. disney 1976 ) . however , until recent advances in technology such as multibeam receivers and powerful correlators , such a survey has not been practical .",
    "the hideep survey ( minchin et al . 2003 ; paper 1 hereafter ) was motivated by the desire to reach previously inaccessible surface - brightness levels . if optical surface - brightness ( e.g. luminosity per square arcsec ) were to correlate with hydrogen column - density ( e.g. hi flux per square arcsec ) , then to reach low surface - brightnesses it would be necessary to reach low column - densities . with an integration time of 9000 seconds per beam , hideep is significantly more sensitive to low column - density gas than any previous survey and thus potentially more sensitive to low surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "hideep followed the same survey strategy and data - reduction path as hipass ( barnes et al .",
    "1998 ) , but with twenty times the integration time .",
    "the parkes multibeam system was actively scanned in declination to cover a @xmath10 region , with full sensitivity being reached over the central @xmath11 .",
    "scans were interleaved to give nyquist sampling and repeated to reach the required depth .",
    "the data were treated in the same way as hipass data : they were reduced in aips++ using the livedata and gridzilla programs and continuum sources were removed by template - fitting with the luther program . in order to minimise the noise ,",
    "all the observations were carried out at night .",
    "the full sensitivity reached was 3.2 mjy beam@xmath12 , which is consistent with a @xmath13 improvement on hipass .    to complement the deep hi data , we obtained eight 1-hour exposures on tech pan films at the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) .",
    "these covered a sky area of @xmath14 , with the same centre as the hi survey data .",
    "the films were digitised using the supercosmos machine at the royal observatory , edinburgh ( hambly et al .",
    "digital stacking of these films brings a @xmath13 improvement in signal to noise ( bland - hawthorn , shopbell & malin 1993 ) , thus gaining us a little over a magnitude in depth .",
    "the use of tech pan films gives a further magnitude improvement over the iii - af _ r_-band plates previously used at the ukst ( parker & malin 1999 ) .",
    "for galaxies with ordinary colours , our @xmath15 surface - brightness limit of 26.5 _ r _ mag arcsec@xmath1 is equivalent to @xmath16 _ b _ mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the bandpass limit of the multibeam system means that only objects with a heliocentric velocity less than 12,700 kms@xmath12 can be detected ( 173 mpc for h@xmath17 = 75 kms@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , after correction to cmb rest frame velocities ) , thus the volume of the 36 square degree optical overlap region is 19,000 mpc@xmath18 . within this volume",
    "we find a total of 129 sources , of which 107 can be identified with individual galaxies .",
    "in paper 1 , we identified sources found in the hi data with optical counterparts on the tech pan films .",
    "a comparison of the offsets of the optical positions from the hi positions for the sources with secure identifications ( those with catalogued velocities matching the hi velocity and those confirmed by hi interferometry or optical spectroscopy follow - up observations ) with the offsets for less certain counterparts ( those without catalogued velocities or follow - up observations ) showed no significant difference . of the 107 galaxies in this paper ,",
    "87 are secure identifications ; this includes 18 confirmed with our interferometric follow - up and 2 with our spectroscopic follow - up . of the remaining 20 ,",
    "18 are previously catalogued galaxies that do not have redshifts in the literature and two are new detections .",
    "an hi - selected sample is expected to appear different from an optically - selected one . in particular low surface - brightness galaxies  which are seen over much smaller volumes than high surface - brightness galaxies with the same total luminosity in optical surveys ( disney & phillipps 1983 )  are expected to be seen much more easily .",
    "however , gas - poor galaxies , such as ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals , which are found by optical surveys will be invisible at 21-cm .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case with our sample .",
    "as expected , our surface - brightness distribution ( figure [ sbhist ] ) is higher towards lower surface - brightnesses than one finds in optically selected samples such as the eso - lv ( lauberts & valentijn 1989 ) , which is also shown in the figure . a kolmogorov - smirnov test on our observed surface - brightness distribution and the surface - brightness distribution of the eso - lv , which also uses _",
    "r_-band effective surface - brightness , shows that the hypothesis that both are drawn from the same parent population has a significance of less than 1 per cent , due to the larger number of lsb galaxies seen in the hideep sample .",
    "this confirms that hi surveys do , as expected , avoid some of the surface - brightness selection effects present in optical surveys .",
    "optical photometry of hideep galaxies was carried out using a combination of sextractor ( bertins & arnouts 1996 ) and the stsdas package in iraf , where the ellipse task was used to obtain radial surface - brightness profiles .",
    "the measured optical parameters are displayed in table 1 ( a sample is shown here , the full table is available in the online edition ) where column ( 1 ) gives the source name and ( 2 ) the catalogued identification  if there is one .",
    "column ( 3 ) gives the type of the identification graded into 3 classes : `` i d '' denotes objects where both positions and velocities coincide , `` pcg '' ( for previously catalogued galaxy ) where there is a positional coincidence with a previously catalogued galaxy in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) and `` pug '' ( for previously uncatalogued galaxy ) where there is no possible counterpart in ned , and thus no previous positional or redshift data .",
    "three further sub - classes , `` id - vla '' , `` id - atca '' , and `` id - spec '' denote where a previously catalogued galaxy without a redshift has been confirmed as the optical counterpart through our follow - up observations ( by interferometry with the vla or the atca or by spectroscopy at the anu 2.3-m telescope at siding spring respectively ) .",
    "the tabulated optical parameters are as follows : column ( 4 ) gives the apparent magnitude ( @xmath19 ) as measured by the _",
    "mag___best _ parameter in sextractor .",
    "this takes the form of either an adaptive aperture magnitude ( kron 1980 ) , where the size of the aperture is 2.5 times the first - moment radius of the galaxy , or , for crowded fields , an isophotal magnitude ( to the 26 @xmath0 mag arcsec@xmath1 isophote ) with a correction made for the part of the galaxy beyond the isophotal limit ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) , the best algorithm being selected automatically by the program .",
    "simulations by bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) of an _ r_-band ccd image with an isophotal limit of 26 _ r _ mag arcsec@xmath1 ( i.e. very similar to our image ) show that , to the magnitude level of the faintest galaxy in our survey ( 18.6 _ r _ mag ) , the true magnitude is recovered to better than 0.1 mag .",
    "column ( 5 ) gives the effective radius , @xmath20  the radius enclosing half the _",
    "r_-band light .",
    "column ( 6 ) gives the effective surface - brightness @xmath21  the _ r_-band surface - brightness at the effective radius .",
    "this gives a model - independent measure of the surface brightness which can be applied to all types of galaxies .",
    "column ( 7 ) gives the sextractor ellipticity ( @xmath22 ) and ( 8) the estimated _ r_-band absorption at the position of the object from schlegel et al .",

    "column ( 9 ) gives the absolute magnitude @xmath23 , including corrections for galactic absorption , cosmological dimming and internal absorption ( estimated using @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is calculated from @xmath26 ) .",
    "the k - correction out to the bandpass limit of 12,700 kms@xmath12 is negligible .",
    "we use the distances from paper 1 except for galaxies in the centaurus a group ( taken to be those within 1000 kms@xmath12 ) , where we use the distance to the m83 subgroup of 4.5 mpc from thim et al .",
    "column ( 10 ) gives the physical effective radius @xmath27 in kpc .",

    "table [ optpos ] gives the positions of the optical counterparts of the pugs . where these have been confirmed by interferometric follow up , this is indicated by a code in column ( 4 ) giving the run in which they were detected .",
    "the pugs that were not detected in earlier runs were followed up again in later runs , with the result that there are no galaxies in the table that have been followed - up but not detected , although there are two sources which have not been followed - up interferometrically",
    ".    .positions of newly - discovered galaxies in the hideep optical area . for those detected interferometrically ,",
    "column ( 4 ) gives the code for the observing run : a1 - atca , 11/1999 ; a2 - atca , 01/2000 ; v - vla , 01 - 03/2003 ; a3 - atca , 04/2003 .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     table [ importantlsb2 ] summarises the findings of this section .",
    "it can be seen that lsb galaxies make up over half of all gas - rich galaxies , yet have less than 10 per cent of the luminosity density .",
    "the relationship between dynamical @xmath31 and surface - brightness means that luminosity is a biased indicator of the cosmological significance of lsb galaxies .",
    "similarly , the higher hi mass - to - light ratios of lsb galaxies means that they have more gas than would be indicated by their light on a straight extrapolation of @xmath32 from freeman - law galaxies .",
    "the relatively larger sizes of lsb galaxies means that their contribution to cross - sectional area , around 40 per cent , is much higher than would be expected from their luminosity or even from their hi mass .",
    "the totals given here are only for galaxies with @xmath33 .",
    "these are almost entirely spiral galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies , even gas - rich ones , tend to have lower gas masses than this , while elliptical galaxies are too gas - poor to be detected .",
    "most dwarf galaxies have low surface - brightnesses , therefore if these were included it is likely that the total contributions from lsb galaxies would rise .",
    "these numbers should therefore be seen as lower estimates for the total contribution of lsb galaxies .",
    "this survey does not find any lsb ` crouching giant ' galaxies , such as malin 1 . from this , we can rule out lsb galaxies making up more that 6 per cent of the population of luminous ( @xmath34 ) galaxies .",
    "indeed , there does seem to be a minimum surface - brightness at every magnitude level given approximately by @xmath35 ( figure [ bbd ] ) . to higher surface - brightnesses ,",
    "galaxies seem to populate fairly evenly a band approximately 4 magnitudes wide in luminosity and 2 in surface - brightness . beyond this ,",
    "high surface - brightness , low - luminosity galaxies also appear to be rare in the gas - rich population .",
    "the populated band broadens slightly towards lower luminosities , giving it an approximate slope of @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is surface brightness in luminosity per unit area and @xmath38 is the total luminosity ) . from this",
    ", it can be calculated that the radius , @xmath0 , is related to the surface - brightness as @xmath39 , i.e. the radius only changes very slightly with surface - brightness .",
    "once volumetric corrections are made , the number of galaxies per unit volume is flat as we go to lower surface - brightnesses . even within the surface - brightness limit reached by this survey , lsb galaxies contribute over half of the number density of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we find that lsb galaxies contribute approximately 30 per cent of the neutral - hydrogen density , twice the lower limit set by zwaan et al .",
    "lsb galaxies may also contribute around 20 per cent of the total mass density ( again with large errors ) , but only 7 per cent of the luminosity - density .",
    "overall , hi - rich lsb galaxies do not appear to contribute much to the universe .",
    "however , the cross - section to qsoals made by lsb galaxies , which is around 40 per cent of the total cross - section , is disproportionate to their luminosity or baryonic content .",
    "this implies that lsb galaxies could contribute substantially to those qsoals where galaxies are the absorbers .    future work in progress",
    "will see an order of magnitude larger sample assembled from the overlap between hipass and the sdss .",
    "this will give not only an increase in the significance of the results but will also give 5-colour optical data , thus greatly extending our knowledge of hi - selected galaxies",
    ". a larger sample of hi - selected samples from the sdss may be assembled in the medium term by the proposed alfalfa drift - scan survey with the arecibo l - band feed array or in the longer term by surveys carried out with the square kilometre array . however , as neither hipass nor alfalfa reach column - density levels as low as hideep it is unlikely that they will turn up any significant population of extremely lsb galaxies that we have missed .",
    "this is not to say that extremely lsb galaxies do not exist , just that if they do make up a significant population then the amount of hi they contain must be small . in order to search for these galaxies , techniques",
    "other than hi surveys will be necessary .",
    "the optical channel available to us on the ground is fundamentally unsuited to looking for lsb galaxies , but a quite modest switch in wavelengths to either side of the solar peak , which is possible from space , could yield dramatic results .",
    "oconnell ( 1987 ) has discussed the idea of using uv wavelengths , while in the @xmath40-band at 1.6 @xmath41 m the contrast between the sun s scattered zodiacal spectrum and the light from red stars in lsb galaxies could be two orders of magnitude higher than the contrast from the ground .",
    "wide - field near - ir cameras , such as the wfc-3 instrument currently awaiting shipment to the hst , will be needed to exploit this window which is , in principle , capable of revealing galaxies 7 magnitudes lower in surface - brightness than we can detect from the ground .",
