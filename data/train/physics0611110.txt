    "the formulation of the polarization - sensitive spectroscopy in terms of the orientational correlation functions ( ocfs ) has opened up a possibility of the unified description of various signals and clarified information content of different spectroscopic techniques .",
    "@xcite as has been demonstrated , all large variety of different polarization signals can be described by the ocfs of the first and second rank . @xcite more specifically , one can  measure  either ocfs in the time domain , or their time derivatives , or their fourier spectra , or their integral relaxation times .",
    "it is this unification which has made it possible to compare the results of different measurements and to learn about the mechanisms of molecular reorientation , both in the gas phase and in the condensed phase .",
    "the contemporary nonlinear ( third order ) ultrafast polarization spectroscopy is interpreted in terms of the three - time correlation functions ( cfs ) of the dipole moments or polarizability tensors involved .",
    "@xcite however , in practices , their influence on a signal is normally accounted for by a static averaging , or the three - time polarization cfs reduce to the standard ocfs of the second rank , due to either the strong optical dephasing or the shortness of the laser pulse on the rotational dynamic timescale .",
    "all the written above pertains to spectroscopy of ensembles , in which the measured response is averaged over many single - particle contributions .",
    "the situation with the single molecule ( sm ) spectroscopy in general , @xcite and the sm polarization spectroscopy in particular , @xcite is very different .",
    "the sm signal delivers a response of an individual system , whose time dependence reports about fluctuations caused by the system \" nanoenvironment  .",
    "ideally , one would prefer to measure the three - dimensional orientation of the emission dipole moment(s ) in real time .",
    "indeed , there exist several schemes which allow us to do that@xcite .",
    "these techniques require , typically , many photons to get a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this obstacle restricts the length and the time resolution of the recorded signal .",
    "fourkas has suggested that the time evolution of the emission dipole can be determined `` on the fly '' , by detecting sm emission along three different polarization directions.@xcite hohlbein and hbner have recently implemented this method.@xcite    so far , many sm experiments have been designed to detect the in - plane projection of the sm emission along two different ( mutually perpendicular ) polarization directions .",
    "thereby long enough transients can be measured , which permit of the reliable calculation of sm cfs .",
    "the sm dichroism cf is the key dynamic quantity which is delivered by the polarization sm fluorescence microscopy.@xcite this cf is much more complicated than its counterparts which describe polarization responses in ensemble measurements .",
    "the sm dichroism cf is the core object of the present study , which has been inspired by the recent papers.@xcite our aim is threefold .",
    "first , we generalize the approach , which has been developed in @xcite for spherical top molecules within the small - angle rotational diffusion model , to asymmetric top molecules and beyond any particular model of molecular reorientation .",
    "the key dynamic quantities here are the even - rank ocfs , which can either be evaluated within any model of the molecular reorientation available in the literature , @xcite or simulated on a computer .",
    "@xcite second , we discuss a possibility of gaining additional knowledge about molecular reorientation by utilizing non - orthogonal schemes for the detection of sm polarization responses .",
    "third , we demonstrate that a valuable information about the ocfs of the rank higher than second can be extracted from the sm cfs . until recently ,",
    "such an information was available only through the computer simulations and model calculations .",
    "the key quantity in the sm polarization microscopy is the dichroism @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the intensities of the light emission which are detected at two different ( usually , mutually perpendicular ) polarizations @xmath5 , @xmath6 . within the oscillator model , the excitation and emission processes are independent , so that the emission intensity is proportional to the product of two probabilities , @xcite @xmath7 and the sm dichroism ( [ x ] ) is independent of the absorption cross - section @xmath8 .",
    "the absorption probability is given by the square of the scalar product of the polarization of the absorbed light @xmath9 and the absorption dipole moment @xmath10 : @xcite @xmath11 the emission cross - section is given by a similar expression , @xcite @xmath12 in which the polarization of the emitted light , @xmath13 , is explicitly given by the equation@xmath14 @xmath15 being the unit vector along the propagation of the light beam , and @xmath16 being the emission dipole moment .",
    "@xcite    when the fluorescence is collected from an ensemble of molecules , molecular contributions add up incoherently .",
    "thus , in order to get the total emission intensity , one has to average eq.([eps ] ) over all possible orientations of the wave vector @xmath15 .",
    "this yields @xmath17 so that the averaged emission cross - section becomes similar to its absorption counterpart:@xmath18 eq.([i ] ) , in conjunction with eqs.([sa ] ) and ( [ siens ] ) , embody the standard starting point for the calculation of the intensity of the polarized emission in ensemble measurements , @xmath19 , see refs .",
    "@xcite    if we collect emission from a single molecule , the above incoherent averaging procedure is not legitimate any longer .",
    "since the wave vector @xmath15 is specific to a photon which has been emitted by the molecule but the direction of @xmath15 is unknown , we have to average the emission probability ( [ si ] ) over all those @xmath15 which can be collected by the objective .",
    "let @xmath20 be the unit vector along the axis of the objective ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the spherical angles of the unit vector @xmath15 , so that @xmath23 .",
    "we also introduce the light - collection cone angle @xmath24 @xmath25 being the numerical aperture of the objective and @xmath26 being the refraction index of the medium in which the sample is embedded ( fig .",
    "1 clarifies the meaning of the introduced quantities ) .",
    "if we further assume that the emitting molecule is located at the focal point of the ideal and polarization - preserving objective which collects the emission , then the @xmath15-averaging of the emission probability ( [ si ] ) yields@xmath27 the numerical parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are uniquely determined by the collection angle @xmath30 : @xcite@xmath31 where the quantities @xmath32 are defined in the standard way : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 eq.([sisi ] ) generalizes slightly its counterparts from,@xcite allowing for an arbitrary direction of the polarizer @xmath36 in the laboratory frame .",
    "fig.2 shows the behavior of the coefficients of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "both of them increase monotonically with @xmath30 : @xmath39@xmath40@xmath41 , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for every @xmath30 , @xmath44 .",
    "eq.([sisi ] ) reduces to eq.([siens ] ) in the limit of small collection angle ( @xmath45 ) . in this case , the beams with @xmath46 are collected only , the @xmath15-dependent portion of eq.([eps ] ) does not contribute into eq.([si ] ) , so that eq.([sisi ] ) reduces to ( [ siens ] ) since both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "after the insertion of eq.([sisi ] ) into eq.([x ] ) , one gets the general expression for the sm dichroism : @xmath49 if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 and the dichroism attains the familiar form @xmath52 if we employ the orthogonal signal detection scheme ( @xmath53 , then eq.([xgen ] ) simplifies to @xmath54 if , additionally , @xmath25 is high ( @xmath55 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , then the denominator in eq.([xper ] ) becomes constant and @xmath56",
    "let @xmath57 denote collectively the set of three euler angles @xmath58 which specify orientation of the molecular frame with respect to the laboratory one .",
    "let us further introduce the conditional probability density function , @xmath59 which is the probability density that the molecule has orientation @xmath57 at time @xmath2 , provided it had orientation @xmath60 at @xmath61 . by definition",
    ", the quantity ( [ cond ] ) obeys the initial condition @xmath62 .",
    "we also assume that the molecule can be subjected to an external ( anisotropic ) potential @xmath63 , so that the corresponding equilibrium boltzmann distribution reads    @xmath64    @xmath65 being the boltzmann constant , @xmath66 being the temperature , and @xmath67 being the partition function . evidently , @xmath68 .",
    "we are in a position now to define the ocf @xcite @xmath69 @xmath70 being the wigner d - functions .",
    "@xcite if the conditional probability density function ( [ cond ] ) is known , then the ocf ( [ ocf ] ) can be evaluated as follows :    @xmath71    the ocfs ( [ ocf ] ) have been explicitly computed , for example , within the rotational diffusion model .",
    "@xcite    if the ocfs ( [ ocf ] ) are known , one can evaluate any polarization response of interest .",
    "indeed , the cf of any ( for simplicity , real ) orientation - dependent quantity @xmath72 at the time moments @xmath1 and @xmath2 can immediately be expressed through ocfs ( [ ocf ] ) : @xmath73 here @xmath74 are the expansion coefficients of the quantity @xmath72 over the d - functions .",
    "there exists an important particular case , in which cf ( [ b(t ) ] ) simplifies greatly .",
    "namely , let us assume that there are no external fields ( @xmath75 ) , so that rotational phase space is isotropic",
    ". then one can show ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) , that the fundamental ocf ( [ ocf ] ) becomes @xmath76 @xmath77 being the kronecker symbol .",
    "therefore , the cf ( [ b(t ) ] ) is now evaluated as @xmath78 @xmath79 ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities    @xmath80    are the standard ocfs of the rank @xmath81 ( @xmath82 being the angle of relative reorientation )",
    ". they can either be simulated on a computer @xcite or evaluated within the models of molecular reorientation available in the literature .",
    "@xcite    eq.([b1(t ) ] ) can further be simplified in the following important particular case .",
    "let us assume that the quantity of interest , @xmath72 , is specified by the orientation of a unit vector ( for example , a dipole moment ) @xmath83 , which is \" rigidly attached  to the molecule , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "the orientation of the unit vector @xmath83 is uniquely determined by the the spherical angles @xmath85 and is specified , therefore , by the reduced d - function @xmath86 which , apart from the numerical factor , coincides with the corresponding spherical harmonics , @xcite @xmath87 on writing eq.([dred ] ) , we have tacitly assumed that the unit vector @xmath83 is pointed along the @xmath88-axis of the molecular reference frame . in this case , the terms with @xmath89 survive only in eq.([b1(t ) ] ) , so that @xmath90 thus , from the formal point of view , the cf ( [ b2(t ) ] ) is determined by the linear combination of the ocfs @xmath91 with different ranks @xmath81 . of course , the relative significance of the contributions from different ocfs is determined by the weighting coefficients @xmath92 , which depend on a particular form of the quantity under study , @xmath93 .",
    "the cf , which is normally extracted from the sm polarization signal , is defined via the expression @xcite @xmath94 in which @xmath95 is the sm dichroism ( [ xgen ] ) and its time - dependence is induced by molecular rotation .",
    "@xcite to apply a general formalism outlined in the previous section for the evaluation of eq.([c(t ) ] ) , one has to express all the scalar products in eq.([xgen ] ) in terms of the wigner d - functions .",
    "this is easily achieved by the formula @xmath96 and similar expressions for the scalar products @xmath97 .",
    "emphasize that the spherical angles @xmath98 and @xmath99 in eq.([ms ] ) are time - independent and specify orientations of the vectors @xmath20 and @xmath16 , correspondingly , in the laboratory and molecular reference frames .",
    "the proper description of molecular reorientation is accounted for by the ( time - dependent ) euler angles @xmath57 .    to simplify the subsequent calculations",
    ", we can proceed as has been described in the previous section and choose the molecular reference frame in such a way that the emission dipole moment @xmath16 is directed along the @xmath88-axis of this frame .",
    "this is tantamount to putting @xmath100 in eq.([ms ] ) .",
    "then @xmath101 ( the latter being the kronecker delta ) , and eq.([ms ] ) becomes independent of the angle @xmath102 of rotation about the molecular @xmath88-axis : @xmath103 upon the insertion of this formula ( and similar expressions for @xmath97 ) into eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) one realizes that dichroism @xmath104 ( eq.([xgen ] ) ) becomes a function of two euler angles @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ bd])-([ocf1 ] ) are applicable to this case . by using the interconnection ( [ dred ] ) between the spherical harmonics and d - functions ,",
    "one finally gets @xmath108 @xmath109 these are exactly the formulas which have been derived in refs.@xcite emphasize that the domain of validity of eqs .",
    "( [ c(t)sim ] ) , ( [ bd1 ] ) is not confined to linear rotors and spherical tops .",
    "they are valid for a general asymmetric top molecule and will be employed in the remainder of the present paper .",
    "a word of caution is however in order .",
    "first , one should keep in mind that eqs .",
    "( [ c(t)sim ] ) , ( [ bd1 ] ) are applicable for molecular rotation in an isotropic space .",

    "this direction , however , may not coincide with the molecular symmetry axis .",
    "this means that such a choice of the molecular frame may not accommodate the molecular symmetry properly . in order to do that and to evaluate @xmath91 efficiently",
    ", we can switch from the initial frame to another `` convenient '' molecular frame via the corresponding wigner matrix @xmath110 , evaluate the ocf @xmath111 in the reference frame which fully accounts for molecular symmetry and return back to the original molecular frame:@xmath112 emphasize that the angles @xmath113 which specify the relative orientation of the molecular frames introduced above are fixed and known for any particular molecule . to illustrate the use of eq.([mm ] ) , let as consider a perpendicular transition of a symmetric top molecule . then @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the small angle rotational diffusion , for example , @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 being the corresponding diffusion coefficients .",
    "@xcite asymmetric top ocfs @xmath91 within the small angle rotational diffusion equation can be computed , e.g. , by the method described in . @xcite    for the sake of the further comparison , we also present the standard formulas for the intensity of the polarized emission in ensemble measurements . @xcite incorporating the cross - sections ( [ sa ] ) and ( [ siens ] ) into eq.([i ] ) and applying eqs .",
    "( [ b1(t)])-([ocf1 ] ) , one obtains the standard result that the averaged emission intensity is uniquely determined by the second - rank ocf of the dipole moments involved , @xmath119 here @xmath120 are the @xmath81-rank legendre polynomial and @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath99 being the spherical angles which specify the orientation of the absorption ( @xmath123 ) and emission ( @xmath16 ) dipole moments in the molecular reference frame .",
    "once the emission dipole moment @xmath16 is pointed along the @xmath88-axis of the molecular reference frame , then eqs .",
    "( [ c(t)sim ] ) and ( [ bd1 ] ) determine the sm cf .",
    "the coefficients @xmath92 depend upon the ocf rank @xmath81 , the @xmath25 angle @xmath30 , and the relative orientation @xmath124 of the polarizers @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "hereafter , we denote these coefficients as @xmath128 .",
    "the standard choice of the orthogonal detection scheme corresponds to @xmath129 .",
    "the term @xmath130 , since the isotropic component does not contribute to dichroism ( [ xgen ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry of the d - functions dictates that only the coefficients with even @xmath81 contribute into eq.([c(t)sim ] ) .",
    "it can thus be recast into the form@xmath131 ( we have dropped the @xmath132-subscripts for the clarity of notation , and the cf is assumed to be normalized to unity , that is @xmath133 ) .",
    "formally speaking , the sm cf is expressed by the linear combination of all even - rank ocfs.@xcite their relative contributions are determined by the weighting coefficients @xmath134 , which decrease rapidly with the ocf rank @xmath81 , so that a few of them contribute significantly into eq.([c(t)ev ] ) .",
    "let us consider a special case of the orthogonal registration scheme ( @xmath135 ) first .",

    "thus , apart from the numerical factor , the sm cf coincides with the ensemble averaged anisotropy . since the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 in eq.([sisi ] ) increase monotonously with @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the significance of all coefficients @xmath143 with @xmath144 decreases with @xmath30 . as has been shown in,@xcite for example , the cf @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath145 , @xmath146 coincides , practically , with @xmath147 .    the analysis which has been carried out in ref.@xcite and the above considerations mean that , under some typical experimental conditions ( @xmath135 and @xmath30 being close to @xmath148 ) , the sm cf @xmath0 is indistinguishable from the second - rank ocf @xmath147 . if one considers a complicated dependence of @xmath0 on ocfs of various ranks as a nuisance , which obscures interpretation of the measured signal , then the use of the orthogonal detection scheme in conjunction with high-@xmath25 optics allows one to `` measure '' the standard second - rank ocf . on the other hand , eq.([c(t)ev ] ) hints at a unique opportunity to learn about higher - rank ocfs experimentally , even with the use of high-@xmath25 optics .",
    "we suggest that the non - orthogonal registration scheme , when @xmath125 and @xmath126 are not perpendicular to each other , makes this possible .",
    "to clarify the situation , let us consider the signal intensity ( [ ifl ] ) which is measured within the ensemble - averaged spectroscopy .",
    "the intensity consists of the sum of the isotropic component , which contains no information about molecular rotation , and the anisotropic component , @xmath149 .",
    "the effect of the detection scheme is exclusively defined by the numerical factor @xmath150 , which determines the relative weights of the two components . therefore , in order to extract ocf @xmath149 out of the signal , it is sufficient to perform measurements of the emission intensities at any two different polarizations @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "a common practice is to use the magic angle conditions ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) , as well as parallel ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) detection schemes .",
    "the situation with the sm polarization spectroscopy is very different .",
    "the sm cf ( [ c(t)ev ] ) has weighted contributions from virtually all even - ranked ocfs , and the weights themselves , @xmath134 , are clearly detection scheme dependent .",
    "the coefficients @xmath134 for several few first @xmath157 are plotted in fig . 3 for @xmath136 ( small @xmath25 ) and for @xmath141 ( high @xmath25 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 in eq.([xgen ] ) increase monotonously with @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "one thus expects that the coefficients @xmath134 transform gradually from those depicted in fig . 3 in the upper panel to those depicted in the lower panel , following the increase of @xmath30 .",
    "evidently , @xmath158-components dominate the signal for any polarization scheme , so that the contribution due to the second rank ocfs is the most significant .",
    "both @xmath159 and @xmath160 reach their maxima at @xmath135 : @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "this means that the standard orthogonal scheme reflects predominantly the decay of the second rank ocf , since @xmath163 of the low-@xmath25 signal and @xmath164% of the high-@xmath25 signal is determined by @xmath147 . if the angle @xmath124 between the polarizations @xmath125 and @xmath126 decreases , then the contribution due to @xmath159 also dominates , but the higher rank ocfs start to contribute more and more significantly .",
    "for a low-@xmath25 signal , for example , the forth - rank contribution achieves its maximum of @xmath165% at @xmath166 while the second order contribution remains as high as @xmath167% .",
    "the shapes of the curves @xmath168 and @xmath169 are evidently different . every coefficient @xmath168 with @xmath144 , as a function of @xmath124 , exhibits an ( asymmetric ) bell - like shape with a single maximum .",
    "@xmath160 , as well as @xmath159 , increase monotonously with @xmath124 , while all @xmath169 with @xmath144 decrease rapidly .",
    "an overall tendency can be described as follows : the closer are @xmath125 and @xmath126 to each other , the more @xmath134 coefficients contribute to the signal .",
    "this is clarified by figs .",
    "4 , in which we present the completeness parameters @xmath170 for few first @xmath171 . as to the low-@xmath25 detection ,",
    "the first few @xmath157 are necessary to faithfully reproduce the signal for @xmath124 close to @xmath148 , while much more terms are necessary for small @xmath124 .",
    "the same is also true for the high-@xmath25 detection , but the convergence is much more rapid . in general , the high-@xmath25 detection is more second - rank ocf dominated than the low-@xmath25 one .",
    "we emphasize however that the high-@xmath25 cf @xmath0 coincides with @xmath147 in the case of the orthogonal detection scheme only ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "otherwise , it also depends on ocfs of different even ranks .",
    "we conclude the present section with the following comment . on writing the starting eq.([x ] ) for the sm dichroism , we have tacitly assumed that the emission intensities @xmath172 and @xmath173 scale identically . to take into account a possible imbalance @xmath174 of the channels",
    ", we can redefine the sm dichroism as @xmath175 .",
    "@xcite we can then repeat the above analysis , taking into account that the coefficients @xmath134 acquire an additional @xmath174-dependence . in that case , for example , the isotropic contribution is nonzero , @xmath176 .",
    "if , furthermore , there are several emission dipole moments,@xcite the above approach can also be generalized straightforwardly .",
    "as has been demonstrated in sec.5 , the non - orthogonal detection schemes contain , potentially , more information on the high - rank ocfs than the standard orthogonal schemes .",
    "the question thus arises if it is possible to extract @xmath177 with @xmath144 from the sm cf @xmath0 .",
    "to clarify the situation , we compute the signal within the simplest model of molecular reorientation , the spherical top small angle diffusion . within this model , @xcite the ocfs",
    "are described by the exponential formula @xmath178 we have chosen this model since it is most frequently applied for the interpretation of sm cfs .",
    "let us consider the small-@xmath25 detection first ( fig .",
    "@xmath0 calculated within the orthogonal detection scheme ( @xmath135 ) and within the scheme with @xmath166 ( this angle provides the maximum for the @xmath179-contribution , see fig .",
    "3 , upper panel ) are seen to be markedly different , both mutually and from @xmath147 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm cf with @xmath135 is rather close to @xmath147 , and the slopes of both sm cfs , as well as the slope of @xmath147 , are almost the same .",
    "this is totally understandable , since ( i ) @xmath180% of the @xmath135 cf and @xmath181 of its @xmath166 counterpart are determined by @xmath147 and ( ii ) the higher - rank ocfs decay much more rapidly than those with @xmath182 .    theoretically speaking ,",
    "the procedure of the extraction of the high - rank ocfs from @xmath0 is straightforward .",
    "one can perform several ( say , @xmath183 ) measurements at @xmath183 different detection angles @xmath124 , truncate the number of summations in eq.([c(t)ev ] ) by @xmath183 , and solve the corresponding system of linear equations for @xmath177 , @xmath184 .",
    "such a procedure , however , can hardly be feasible in practice .",
    "there exists a cruder , but much more robust procedure which is exemplified by fig .",
    "we can calculate the quantity @xmath185 evidently , @xmath186 represents a weighted sum of the ocfs of the rank @xmath187 and higher . since the higher - rank contributions into @xmath186 decrease rapidly with @xmath157 ( fig .",
    "3 ) one expects that @xmath186 is determined , predominantly , by @xmath179 .",
    "this qualitative expectation is corroborated by fig .",
    "5 . evidently , @xmath186 and @xmath179 do not coincide but , as has been explained above , their slopes are virtually the same .    the procedure described above can also be applied to the high-@xmath25 detection , see fig .",
    "furthermore , the situation is much more fortunate in this case , since the orthogonal cf is now solely determined by the second rank ocf @xmath147 ( @xmath188 , see also fig .",
    "it is interesting that cfs @xmath189 and @xmath190 , which are presented in the fig .",
    "6 , are rather close to each other , since both of them are predominantly determined by @xmath147 . however , the cf@xmath191 is almost indistinguishable from @xmath179 .",
    "the above results demonstrate that the proposed ( or similar ) procedure of the extraction of high - order ocfs from the sm cf @xmath0 is useful and robust , both for high- and low @xmath25 objectives .",
    "once the higher order ocfs are available , one can get valuable information on the dynamics of the sm reorientation .",
    "for example , let us suppose that orientational relaxation proceeds exponentially .",
    "then , if the second - rank ocf is available only , one can extract an effective time of the ocf decay , but can not learn anything about rotational dynamics . if both @xmath147 and @xmath179 are known , one then can calculate the ratio of their relaxation times .",
    "this quantity , being very model - specific , allows one to discriminate between different reorientation mechanisms . for the small - angle diffusion model",
    ", the ratio equals to @xmath192 ( see eq.([dif2 ] ) ) . for the jump diffusion model ,",
    "it is close to @xmath193.@xcite more sophisticated approaches to the orientational relaxation @xcite also predict that the comparison of the behavior of ocfs of different ranks makes it possible to identify the underling mechanisms of orientational relaxation .    before concluding the present section",
    ", we wish to discuss possible causes of the deviation of @xmath0 from the exponential form ( see also refs .",
    "there can be two fundamentally different groups of reasons .",
    "first , @xmath0 is described by the weighted sum of the even - rank ocfs , eq.([c(t)ev ] ) . despite",
    "the second - rank ocf contributes predominately into @xmath0 , the contributions due to the higher - rank ocfs can not be neglected , in general .",
    "it is only for a high-@xmath25 objective and close - to - orthogonal detection scheme that these higher order contributions are vanishingly small and @xmath194 .",
    "second , the ocfs ( including the second - rank ocf ) can be non - exponential due to a variety of reasons .",
    "molecular rotation is not necessarily diffusive . while the jump diffusion model predicts exponentially decaying ocfs @xcite (",
    "although their rank - dependence differs from that given by eq.([dif ] ) ) , the restricted diffusion model , @xcite the diffusion - equation - with - memory models and other memory function approaches @xcite predict the ocfs of a spherical molecule to be described by the sum of several ( in general , complex ) exponentials .",
    "more sophisticated approaches deliver , of course , more complex ocfs . on the other hand , the so - called inertial effects , which induce highly non - exponential behavior of ocfs , @xcite are irrelevant for the sm spectroscopy since they manifest themselves on a time scale which is much faster than the time resolution of typical sm experiments .",
    "a deviation of the molecular shape from spherical complicates molecular reorientation even in the small angle diffusion limit .",
    "the second - rank ocf @xmath195 of an asymmetric top , for example , is described by the sum of two exponentials .",
    "@xcite ( iii ) . of relevance is the direction of the emission dipole moment @xmath16 in the molecular reference frame ( see eqs .",
    "( [ mm ] ) and ( [ mms ] ) ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath16 is parallel to the axis of the linear or symmetric rotor , the corresponding second - rank ocf is mono - exponential . if @xmath16 is perpendicular to the molecular axis , then the corresponding ocf is two - exponential ( see eq.([dif ] ) ) .",
    "( iv ) . finally , internal rotations can also cause deviations from exponentiality .",
    "we have developed an approach for the calculation of the sm cf @xmath0 , eq.([c(t ) ] ) , in the general case of asymmetric top molecules .",
    "the key dynamic quantities of our analysis are the even - rank ocfs @xmath196 ( [ ocf1 ] ) , the weighted sum of which constitutes @xmath0 .",
    "the ocfs can either be evaluated within any model of molecular reorientation available in the literature @xcite or simulated on a computer .",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated that the use of non - orthogonal schemes for the detection of sm polarization responses allows one to manipulate the weighting coefficients in the expansion of @xmath0 on ocfs .",
    "thus a valuable information about the ocfs of the rank higher than second can be extracted from the sm cf @xmath0 . until recently",
    ", such an information was available only through computer simulations and/or model calculations . neither the corresponding information is accessible within the ensemble - averaged spectroscopy , in which one `` measures '' exclusively the second - rank ocf ( [ ifl ] ) .",
