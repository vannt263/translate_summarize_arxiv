    "brownian motion is one of the paradigms of statistical mechanics . following the seminal works of einstein , langevin and smoluchowsky , a detailed mathematical analysis can be made on the basis of langevin or fokker - planck equations .",

    "somewhat surprisingly , the full time - dependent solution for linear @xmath10 and @xmath11 is not available , see @xcite for a detailed discussion . in the case of nonlinear dynamics ,",

    "however , contrary to the claims made in some of these papers , the problem of the first passage time moments , and the related issue of finding the asymptotic drift velocity @xcite , was not solved in the most general case . indeed , with a few exceptions @xcite , all the results that have been obtained exclude the cases when one or both of the  @xmath12 \" dynamics have _ unstable _ fixed points , and thus do not consider the possibility of crossing unstable fixed points in the long time dynamics . the technical subtleties were first highlighted and discussed in detail in a recent paper @xcite . in view of the broad applicability and importance of dichotomous markov noise , a comprehensive review of the results for the asymptotic drift velocity in periodic systems driven by such a noise is called for and is the subject of this paper . as a first illustration we also apply these results to the calculation of the drift for the rocking ratchet .",
