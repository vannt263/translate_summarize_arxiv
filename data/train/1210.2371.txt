    "as is well known , most materials , regardless how pure they may seem at the macroscopic level , have a rather complicated microscopic structure .",
    "it may then come as a surprise that physical phenomena such as heat or electric conduction are described so well using differential equations with smooth , sometimes even constant , coefficients .",
    "an explanation has been offered by homogenization theory : rapid oscillations at the microscopic level average out , or homogenize , at the macroscopic scale . however",
    ", this does not mean that the microscopic structure is simply washed out .",
    "indeed , while it disappears from the structure of the resulting equations , it remains embedded in the values of effective material constants , e.g. , the coefficients .",
    "an illustrative example of a homogenization problem is that of effective conductance .",
    "we will formulate an instance of this problem in the setting of resistor networks .",
    "let  @xmath0 denote the @xmath5-dimensional hypercubic lattice and suppose that each unordered nearest - neighbor edge  @xmath6 is assigned a value @xmath7  called the _ conductance _ of @xmath6 . for any @xmath8 , let  @xmath9 be the edges with at least one endpoint in @xmath10 . given an @xmath11 and a finite @xmath8 , let @xmath12 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where each pair @xmath13 is counted only once .",
    "this is the electrostatic ( dirichlet ) energy for the potential  @xmath14 with dirichlet boundary condition on the boundary vertices of  @xmath10 .",
    "consider now the square box @xmath15 .",
    "a quantity of prime interest for us is the _ effective conductance _ , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and where @xmath18 are those vertices outside @xmath10 that have an edge into  @xmath10 . by kirchhoff s and ohm s laws",
    "( see , e.g. , doyle and snell  @xcite ) , @xmath19 is the total electric current flowing through the network when the boundary vertices are kept at voltage  @xmath20 .    for homogeneous resistor networks ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath21 for all @xmath6 , the infimum is achieved by @xmath22 and so @xmath23 . a question of ( reasonably ) practical interest is then what happens when the conductances  @xmath24 are no longer constant , but remain close to a constant .",
    "in particular , we may assume that they are uniformly elliptic , i.e. , @xmath25 a comparison of @xmath26 with these @xmath24 s and the homogeneous case shows that @xmath27 is still of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , thanks to the choice of the linear boundary condition , by subadditivity arguments the limit @xmath29 exists almost surely for any ergodic distribution of the conductances .",
    "the problem left to resolve is thus a computation of the limit value .",
    "although @xmath30 can be computed explicitly only in a handful of ( mostly periodic ) cases , it can be characterized in large generality : suppose that @xmath31 is a sample from a shift - ergodic law  @xmath32 on the product space @xmath33 $ ] indexed by edges of  @xmath0 .",
    "( technically , @xmath34 is the coordinate projection on edge @xmath6 . )",
    "as is well known ( papanicolaou and varadhan  @xcite , kozlov  @xcite and knnermann  @xcite and the book jikov , kozlov and oleinik  @xcite ) , @xmath35 here @xmath36 is expectation with respect to  @xmath32 , @xmath37 are the unit coordinate vectors in  @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the gradient of  @xmath40 in direction of  @xmath41 with @xmath42 denoting the shift by  @xmath43 ; i.e. , the map on @xmath44 such that  @xmath45 .",
    "the expression in can be interpreted as the dirichlet energy density  with the spatial average naturally replaced by the ensemble average .",
    "once the ( deterministic ) leading - order of @xmath27 has been identified , the next natural question is that of fluctuations .",
    "it is obvious  e.g. , by checking the explicitly computable @xmath46 case  that no universal limit law can be expected for general conductance distributions , but progress could perhaps be made for the ( physically most appealing ) case of i.i.d",
    ".  conductances .",
    "however , even here establishing just the order of magnitude of the fluctuations turned out to be an arduous task .",
    "indeed , more than a decade ago wehr  @xcite showed that @xmath47 for some  @xmath48 but a corresponding upper bound has been furnished only recently by gloria and otto  @xcite .",
    "both of these results contain important technical caveats : wehr requires continuously distributed @xmath24 s while gloria and otto express their results under a `` massive '' cutoff ( at least in dimension 2 ) .",
    "gloria and otto drew important ideas from an earlier unpublished note by naddaf and spencer  @xcite where ( optimal ) upper bounds on the variance are derived for certain correlated conductance laws .",
    "the main tool of @xcite is the _ meyers estimate _ ( cf meyers  @xcite ) , to be used heavily in the present note as well",
    ". other noteworthy earlier derivations of ( suboptimal ) variance upper bounds include an old paper by yurinskii  @xcite and a more recent paper by benjamini and rossignol  @xcite .",
    "closely related to these estimates are recent derivations of quantitative central limit theorems for random walk among random conductances and approximations of the limiting diffusivity matrix , e.g. , caputo and ioffe  @xcite , bourgeat and piatnitski  @xcite , boivin  @xcite , mourrat  @xcite , gloria and mourrat  @xcite , etc .",
    "incidentally , the meyers estimate is also the key tool in  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present note is to prove that , for i.i.d .",
    "conductances which are ( deterministically ) not too far from a constant , the asymptotic law of @xmath27 is in fact gaussian .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the normal random variable with mean  @xmath50 and variance  @xmath51 .",
    "then we have :    [ thm1 ] suppose the conductances @xmath24 are i.i.d . for each @xmath52 ,",
    "there is @xmath53 such that the following holds : if is satisfied @xmath32-a.s .  with this  @xmath54 ,",
    "then for each @xmath17 there is @xmath55 such that @xmath56 whenever the conductance law is non - degenerate we have @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "the proof also immediately yields :    [ cor1.2 ] under the conditions of theorem  [ thm1 ] , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is as in .",
    "a few remarks are in order :    \\(1 ) notice that does not give us much information on the `` order expansion '' of @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , we know that @xmath62 is to the leading order equal to @xmath63 but when this order is subtracted , the next - order term is ( presumably ) of boundary size . in @xmath64",
    ", this is still larger than the typical size of the fluctuations .",
    "( this is referred to as the systematic error in @xcite . ) notwithstanding , what does tell us is the character of the leading order _",
    "random _ term .",
    "\\(2 ) there is in fact a formula for @xmath60 , see theorem  [ thm2 ] below , which also shows that @xmath65 is a bi - quadratic ( and thus smooth ) function of  @xmath66 .",
    "however , the formula involves complicated conditioning and does not seem very useful for practical computations .",
    "\\(3 ) there is no restriction on the single - conductance law other than . in particular",
    ", this law can have a non - absolutely continuous part including atoms .",
    "certain technical problems do arise at this level of generality ; see section  [ sec2.5 ] which , we believe , is of independent interest .",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm1 ] by reducing it to the martingale central limit theorem .",
    "there are two main technical ingredients : homogenization theory ( which enables a stationary martingale approximation of  @xmath27 ) and analytical estimates for finite - volume harmonic coordinates ( by which we control the errors in the martingale approximation ) .",
    "the restrictions to rectangular boxes , linear boundary conditions and small ellipticity contrasts permit us to encapsulate the analytical input into a single step , the meyers estimate , cf proposition  [ prop : meyers estimate ] and  theorem  [ lpbound - k ] .",
    "these restrictions can be relaxed but not without additional arguments not all of which have been handled satisfactorily at this time .",
    "these are deferred to a follow - up paper .",
    "we remark that two recent preprints have been brought to our attention at the time this work was first announced in conference talks .",
    "first , nolen  @xcite has established a normal approximation to the effective conductance defined over a periodic environment , in the limit when the period tends to infinity .",
    "second , in a preprint that was posted at the time of writing the present note , rossignol  @xcite formulates and proves a central limit law for the _ effective resistance _ for the corresponding problem on a torus .",
    "nolen defines the problem over continuum , albeit with a rather strong assumption on an underlying gaussian i.i.d .  structure .",
    "rossignol s setting is based on minimizing the electrostatic energy over currents ( rather than potentials ) subject to a restriction on the total current flowing around the torus . by a well known reciprocity relation between effective conductance and resistance , these papers appear to address similar problems .",
    "the present paper differs from both nolen  @xcite and rossignol  @xcite primarily in its emphasis on fixed ( dirichlet ) , as opposed to periodic , boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , a majority of our technical work is aimed at controlling the resulting boundary effects . also the way a gaussian limit law is established is quite different : nolen appeals to stein s method",
    ", rossignol uses noise - sensitivity tools while we invoke the martingale central limit theorem .",
    "a notable deficiency of the present paper compared to  @xcite and  @xcite is the limitation on ellipticity contrast .",
    "nolen overcomes this by an appeal to gloria and otto  @xcite , although this ultimately precludes the most interesting conclusion ( namely , the clt without `` massive '' cutoff ) in  @xmath67 .",
    "approach appears to work seamlessly for all elliptic product laws thanks to `` enhanced '' form of averaging coming from the periodic boundary condition .",
    "while the gloria - otto method can perhaps be adapted to our situation as well , just as for nolen  @xcite it fails to deliver the desired conclusion in @xmath67 .",
    "the issue is that the method yields bounds on the moments of the corrector , which diverge in @xmath67 , while we need only moments of the gradients of the corrector .",
    "( _ update in revised version _ :",
    "this issue has now been overcome in gloria , neukamm and otto @xcite , albeit only in either infinite volume or for periodic boundary conditions . ) notwithstanding , our point of view is that the moment bounds seem to be a separate technical matter , and so , for the present paper , we decided to sacrifice on generality of the distribution and derived the clt only in the simplest , albeit still physically interesting , case .",
    "here we discuss the strategy of the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] and state its principal ingredients in the form of suitable propositions .",
    "the actual proofs begin in section  [ sec3 ] . -1 mm      a standard way to control fluctuations of a function of i.i.d .",
    "random variables is by way of a _ martingale approximation_. let us order the random variables @xmath68 in any ( for now ) convenient way and let @xmath69 to be the @xmath70-algebra generated by the first  @xmath71 of them .",
    "( since we only aim at a distributional convergence , the @xmath70-algebras may depend on  @xmath72 . )",
    "then @xmath73 where @xmath74 obviously , the quantity @xmath75 is a martingale increment . in order to show distributional convergence to @xmath76 , it suffices to verify the ( lindenberg - feller - type ) conditions of the martingale central limit theorem due to brown  @xcite :    1 .",
    "there exists @xmath77 such that @xmath78 in probability , and 2 .",
    "for each @xmath79 , @xmath80 in probability .",
    "the sums on the left suggest invoking the spatial ergodic theorem , but for that we would need to ensure that the individual terms in the sum are ( at least approximated by ) functions that are stationary with respect to shifts of  @xmath0 .",
    "this necessitates the following additional input :    1 .   a specific choice of the ordering of the edges , and 2 .   a more explicit representation for @xmath75",
    ".    we will now discuss various aspects of these in more detail .",
    "recall that @xmath81 denotes the set of all ( unordered ) edges in  @xmath0 .",
    "we will order @xmath81 as follows : let @xmath82 denote the lexicographic ordering of the vertices of  @xmath0",
    ". explicitly , for @xmath83 and @xmath84 we have @xmath85 if either @xmath86 or @xmath87 and there exists @xmath88 such that @xmath89 for all @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    ". we will write @xmath92 if @xmath87 and @xmath85 .    for the purpose of defining a stationary ordering of the edges , and also easier notation in some calculations that are to follow , we now identify @xmath81 with the set of pairs @xmath93 , where @xmath41 and @xmath88 , so that @xmath93 corresponds to the edge between the vertices @xmath43 and @xmath94",
    ". we will then write @xmath95 again , @xmath96 if @xmath97 but @xmath98 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath82 is a complete order on  @xmath81 .",
    "a key fact about this ordering is its stationarity with respect to shifts :    [ lemma-2.3 ] if @xmath97 then also @xmath99 for all @xmath100 .",
    "proof this is a trivial consequence of the definition .",
    "now we proceed to identify the sigma algebras @xmath101 in the martingale representation above .",
