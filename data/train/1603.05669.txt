    "these authors demonstrate that the 2  gev excess gamma - ray emission from the gc detected by _",

    "similar conclusions were also reached by other authors ( qiang & zhang 2014 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the _ fermi _ results can also be explained by a dark matter model ( e.g. , hooper & goodenough 2011 ) .",
    "a significant effort is being invested into further searches for dark matter in the gc ( see , e.g. , van eldick 2015 ) .    one way to discriminate between the msp and dark matter scenarios",

    "although such searches are now being carried out , their success is strongly dependent on the scattering environment in the gc region which is still not well understood .",
    "the principle focus of this paper is to develop a new approach to constraining the pulsar population in the gc .",
    "as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we propose that when a neutron star ( ns ) approaches within @xmath12  pc from sgr  a * , the ram pressure from the accretion disk shocks the pulsar wind fairly close to the ns .",

    "nss residing in the inner 0.1  pc of the gc are characterized by fast motions with the winds undergoing strong interactions with the gas surrounding sgr  a * and its accretion disk . here",
    "we demonstrate that when the ns dives into the accretion disk , its relativistic wind is shocked , giving a powerful nonthermal x - ray and gamma - ray transient that lasts from @xmath13  1 month to years .",
    "pulsar winds are known to be bright x - ray and @xmath14-ray sources when they interact with an ionized medium ( e.g. , romani et al .",
    "these interactions are particularily intense in systems where the pulsar has a close , massive star companion ( paredes et al .",
    "2013 ; dubus 2013 ) .",
    "the interaction model we propose , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , is based on earlier work by giannios & sironi ( 2013 ) can be applied to any type of spin - powered pulsar .    , has a wind that is sufficiently energetic to produce a synchrotron emitting , bow - shock region with termination distance @xmath15 which can be observable at x - ray energies . ]",

    ", the gas may have sufficient angular momentum to form an accretion disk . because of the low accretion rate to the black hole , the accretion is likely to take place through a geometrically thick disk with its density profile being rather model dependent .",

    "1995 ) or @xmath22 as , e.g. , motivated by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( tchekhovskoy & mckinney  2012 ) . in the case of a convection dominated accretion flow solution , the density profile is shallower ( @xmath23 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) . for",

    "the ram pressure @xmath27  cgs of the disk is maximal and shocks the ns wind at a distance from the ns at which it matches the wind pressure , @xmath28 . the resulting termination distance from the ns , @xmath29 the shocked wind moves at a mildly relativistic speed @xmath30 and expands on a timescale @xmath31    at the termination shock",

    "for @xmath48 , the pairs radiate at a rate comparable to the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar for the adopted particle power - law slope of @xmath49 .",
    "this estimate is likely to be optimistic for the @xmath14-ray emission from the transient since , for a steeper particle index @xmath50 , the @xmath14-ray emission is weaker .",
    "the luminosity from the shocked wind at pericentre can easily exceed that of the quiescent x - ray emission and , under favorable conditions , be comparable to that in the _ fermi - lat _ band .    the pericentre passage of the pulsar takes place over a timescale @xmath51 this is also the characteristic timescale over which the pulsar wind undergoes the most intense interaction with the surrounding accretion disk and , as a result , marks the duration of the flares .",
    "whether one expects a single flare or a pair of flares , depends on the relative inclination of the orbit of the neutron star with respect to that of the accretion disk ( see giannios & sironi 2013 ) .",
    "if the disk is co - planar with the stellar orbit ( e.g. , they are co- or counter - rotating ) the emission from the bow shock will peak at pericentre . for large inclination of the two orbital planes , two flares are expected : one before and one after the pericentre passage . since for thick disks , where the height is comparable to the radius ,",
    "the timescale for each crossing of the midplane of the disk is similar to the duration of the pericentre passage @xmath52 ( for lightcurve examples , see giannios & sironi 2013 ) .",
    "the previous estimates of the synchrotron emission from the shocked pulsar wind are based on a simple one - zone model .",
    "the shocked fluid follows a bow shock structure .",
    "the accelerated particles radiate substantially close to the termination shock but they continue to radiate further back in the tail .",
    "the pulsar spends at pericentre much longer the time it takes for the shocked fluid to leave the termination shock : @xmath53 . in the tail of the bow shock , the shocked fluid",
    "is still confined by the thermal pressure from the accretion disk .",
    "the pressure of the disk is not negligible @xmath54 ; containing substabtial turbulent magnetic field of strength @xmath55",
    "g. therefore , after a modest initial expansion , the shocked wind will undergo a much longer process of mixing with the disk material .",
    "substantial emission for the ultrarelativistic particles is expected at this stage possibly enhancing the power of the transient .",

    "as demonstrated above , pulsars and msps with spin down luminosity @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 and with orbit with pericentre distance of @xmath62  pc from sgr  a * make promising sources for an observable transient .",
    "given the highly elliptical orbits of the stars observed in the region ( see next section for details ) , these ns are expected to spend most of their orbit at apocentre distance of @xmath63 . as can be seen from the current sample of pulsars shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edotage ] , a significant fraction , approximately 7% of all observed pulsars , have @xmath64  ergs  s@xmath1 . for msps ,",
    "the corresponding fraction is 8% .",
    "it is important to note , however , that these estimates are based on observationally selected samples of radio pulsars which are necessarily biased towards bright objects .",

    "2005 ) . ]",
    "a simple argument can be made by noting that we have observed one magnetar with projected distance of @xmath66  pc from sgr  a * ( mori et al .",
    "2013 ; eatough et al .  2013 ) . in total",
    "there are 26 magnetars currently known in the milky way ( for a complete list , see olausen & kaspi 2014 and the mcgill magnetar catalogpulsar / magnetar ] ) .",
    "their typical lifetime from spin - down age arguments is @xmath67  yr , giving a crude estimate on the magnetar birthrate to be one every @xmath68  yr . when compared to the pulsar birthrate of 23 per century ( vranesevic et al .",
    "2004 ; faucher - giguere & kaspi 2006 ) , we conclude that for every 10 ns born , one of these will be a magnetar .",
    "the existence of one magnetar in sgr  a * therefore suggests the existence of @xmath69  ns younger than @xmath67  yr . most of the pulsars in fig .  4 with characteristic ages below @xmath67  yr have @xmath70  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , those pulsars with ages below @xmath67  yr but @xmath71  ergs  s@xmath1 are thought to be associated with the magnetar population : j1550@xmath725418 ( camilo et al .  2007 ) , j1622@xmath724950 ( levin et al .",
    "2010 ) , j1734@xmath723333 ( espinoza et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "an independent check on this simple estimate of @xmath69  ns with @xmath70  ergs  s@xmath1 can be made from the results of chennamangalam & lorimer ( 2014 ) who found an upper bound of 200 radio pulsars in the gc region that are beaming towards the earth .",
    "assuming a beaming fraction of 10% the total number of radio - loud pulsars in this region is @xmath73 . making use of the psrpoppy simulation software ( bates et al .",
    "2014 ) , we generated a sample of radio pulsars which evolve with time according to the prescription described in detail by faucher - giguere & kaspi ( 2006 ) . under these assumptions , we find that the fraction of pulsars with @xmath64  ergs  s@xmath1 is approximately 0.5% .",
    "the results of chennamangalam & lorimer ( 2014 ) therefore limit the population of @xmath64  ergs  s@xmath1 to be @xmath74 .",
    "relaxing the assumption of spin - down such that @xmath75  ergs  s@xmath1 would raise this limit by a further factor of three .",
    "given the uncertainties involved in both these estimates , we conclude that one can reasonably expect of the order of several to a dozen non - recycled pulsars of substantial spin down luminosity in the region of interest .      in their population study , making use of the diffuse gamma - ray emission observed by _",

    "the fraction of sources with @xmath64  ergs  s@xmath1 is approximately 0.1% , suggesting a population of @xmath78  sources . the corresponding fraction above @xmath79  ergs  s@xmath1 is about 3% , implying a population of @xmath80 millisecond pulsars .",
    "so far one magnetar is known within 0.1  pc from the gc .",
    "there is also evidence that the source g359.950.04 at a projected distance of 0.3  pc from the gc is powered by the wind of an energetic pulsar ( wang , lu & gotthelf 2006 ) .",
    "we demonstrated above that @xmath81 msps and pulsars with @xmath82  ergs  s@xmath1 may be expected to orbit arround sgr a * within @xmath83 .",
    "these pulsars spend most of their orbit at apocentre distance that determines their orbital period of @xmath84 years . depending on the ellipticity of their orbit",
    ", they can have brief excursions close to sgr  a*. the stars observed at this scale  the s cluster are characterized by highly elliptical orbits of median eccentricity @xmath85 ( genzel et al .",
    "if the pulsars have similar orbits , their pericentre is @xmath86  pc ; well within the distance of interest here .",
    "the rate at which pulsars have their pericentre passage may be estimated to be @xmath87 per century .    the relatively large gas density in this region , in connection with the large pulsar velocities results in strong interactions of the pulsar wind with the ambient gas .",
    "pairs accelerated at the shocked pulsar wind are strong synhrotron emitters . given its high spatial resolution , _ chandra _ is well positioned to observe these interactions in the x - ray band , _ fermi - lat _ may also be able to detect the source .",
    "characteristic signatures include a flaring , non - thermal source with luminosity @xmath88  ergs  s@xmath1 that lasts for months or years .",
    "other observed sources within the chandra psf at sgr a  * are the steady bremsstrahlung emission from @xmath89  kev gas and flares from the black - hole vicinity ( baganoff et al .",
    "the flares last for minutes to hours and are clearly distinct from the @xmath90 long flares that are discussed here .",
    "month long flares from the same region may originate from the interaction on",
    "_ non_-relativistic winds of massive stars with the disk ( giannios & sironi 2013 ) . in this case , however , the flares are expected to be thermal and with their emission peaking in the soft x - ray band , in contrast to the non - thermal transients discussed here .",
    "the interaction can serve as a probe of the density , temperature and thickness of the accretion disk that surrounds sgr a  * at a scale that is hard to probe otherwise ( see also nayakshin , cuadra & sunyaev 2004 ; giannios & sironi 2013 ) .",
    "the duration of the event directly contrains the pericentre distance of the source @xmath91  s. depending on the inclination of the ns orbit with respect to that of the accretion disk , one or two flares are possible .",
    "we encourage chandra archival searches for such long transients as well as systematic monitoring of sgr  a*.",
