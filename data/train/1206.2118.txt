    "one big difference between @xmath64 and @xmath1 is that the former algebra is _ filtered _ whereas the latter is _",

    "the usefulness of @xmath64 relies on the fact that @xmath64 is semisimple as an algebra , i.e. forgetting the filtration ( see proposition  [ prop : gsemisimple ] ) .",
    "0.5 cm let us explain the connection to some of the existing work in the literature .",
    "we first comment on the relation of our results with known results in the @xmath10 case .",
    "khovanov  @xcite introduced the arc algebras @xmath4 in his work on the generalization of his celebrated categorification of the jones link polynomial to tangles .",
    "as he showed , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fundamental @xmath67-module .",
    "the grothendieck classes of the indecomposable graded @xmath4-modules , with a suitable normalization of their grading , correspond bijectively to the dual canonical basis elements of the invariant tensor space .",
    "the proof of these facts is completely elementary and does not require any categorified skew howe duality .",
    "huerfano and khovanov categorified the irreducible level - two @xmath36-representations with highest weight @xmath68 in  @xcite , using the arc algebras and categorified skew howe duality ( without calling it that explicitly ) , but without explaining the relation with the level - two cyclotomic klr algebras which had not yet been invented at that time .",
    "that relation only appeared in the work by brundan and stroppel  @xcite , who studied the representation theory of the arc algebras in great detail in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "khovanov showed that the center of the arc algebra @xmath4 is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the @xmath69-springer variety @xmath70 and stroppel and webster showed that @xmath4 can be realized using the intersection cohomology of @xmath70 .",
    "the results in this paper are the @xmath0 analogues of some of the results in the papers cited above .",
    "there are several results for @xmath10 for which we have not yet found the @xmath0 analogues , e.g. we have not defined the quasi - hereditary cover of @xmath1 in this paper .",
    "the quasi - hereditary cover of @xmath4 is due to chen and khovanov  @xcite and stroppel  @xcite and was studied by brundan and stroppel in  @xcite,@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite brundan and stroppel found a remarkable representation theoretic relation between general linear super groups and certain generalized arc algebras .",
    "this is another result for which we do not have an @xmath0-analogue .",
    "0.5 cm let us now comment on the connection with other work on categorified @xmath27-representations and link homologies , for @xmath71 .",
    "there are essentially three diagrammatic or combinatorial approaches which give @xmath27-link homologies ( there are other approaches using representation theory or algebraic geometry for example , but we will not consider those in this introduction ) .    1 .",
    "there is the approach using matrix factorizations due to khovanov and rozansky  @xcite , which was proved to be equivalent to an approach using foams  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "2 .   there is webster s approach using cyclotomic tensor algebras , which generalize the cyclotomic klr - algebras , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "there is an approach using chuang - rouquier complexes over cyclotomic quotients  @xcite ( its details have only been worked out and written up completely for @xmath72 in  @xcite , but see our remarks below for the general case .",
    "note that chuang and rouquier did not prove invariance under the third reidemeister move nor did they discuss braid closures , i.e. knots and links in  @xcite )    only for @xmath73 and @xmath74 it is known that all three approaches give isomorphic link homologies . for @xmath75 they are conjectured to be isomorphic , but only the first and the third approaches are known to give isomorphic link homologies .",
    "let us explain this in a bit more detail .",
    "the paper by lauda , queffelec and rose  @xcite appeared online a little after our paper became available and is completely independent .",
    "they used a slightly different type of @xmath0-foams in order to define their version of categorified level - three skew howe duality and used it to relate the first and third aforementioned approach to @xmath0-link homologies .",
    "although link homologies have attracted a lot of attention , it seems important to us to understand the bigger picture of the categorified representation theory behind the link homologies .    in this paper",
    "we do not work out the application to link homology , but concentrate on the indecomposable projective modules and the center of @xmath1 . in proposition",
    "[ prop : unitriang ] we actually prove a conjecture due to morrison and nieh  @xcite about the relation between the basis webs in @xmath76 and the indecomposables in @xmath62 ( see remark  [ rem : mn ] ) . for related results in this direction , see the work by robert in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it is not so hard to generalize our results in this paper to the case for @xmath27 , with @xmath77 , using matrix factorizations instead of foams . as a matter of fact",
    ", this has been done in the meanwhile by mackaay and yonezawa in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "general @xmath27-foams have not been defined yet ( for a partial case , see  @xcite ) , so they can not be used .",
    "but the results in  @xcite will probably be helpful to define a finite set of relations on @xmath27-foams and to prove that these relations are consistent and sufficient .",
    "having such a definition of @xmath27-foams is important , just as it is important to have generators and relations for any interesting algebra . in our opinion ,",
    "the categorified skew howe duality using foams would be a proper categorification of cautis , kamnitzer and morrison s results on quantum skew howe duality in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27-foams might be very helpful in computing the khovanov - rozansky link homologies effectively ( i.e. using computers ) .",
    "although mackaay and yonezawa did not work out the details , it is fairly straightforward to show that their definitions and results in  @xcite imply that the equivalence between level-@xmath31 cyclotomic klr algebras and @xmath27-web algebras maps the colored chuang - rouquier complex of a braid over a cyclotomic klr algebra to the corresponding colored khovanov - rozansky complex ( due to wu  @xcite and yonezawa  @xcite in the colored case ) .",
    "this would imply the above claim that the third aforementioned construction of @xmath27-link homologies works for all @xmath77 and that the first and the third construction give isomorphic @xmath27-link homologies .",
    "in proposition 4.4 in  @xcite , webster proved that his and khovanov s @xmath0-link homologies are isomorphic , but the proof is quite sophisticated and relies on mazorchuk and stroppel s approach to link homology using functors and natural transformations on certain blocks of category @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "our results in this paper might help to give an elementary and direct isomorphism between webster s and khovanov s @xmath0-link homologies . in order to do that",
    ", one would have to use yet to be defined bimodules over the cyclotomic tensor algebras which categorify the @xmath0-webs .    for @xmath75 webster",
    "conjectured his @xmath27-link homology to be isomorphic to khovanov and rozansky s , but did not prove it . following the same reasoning as for @xmath74 , such a proof should now be within reach .",
    "0.5 cm finally , let us mention one interesting open question w.r.t .",
    "@xmath0-web algebras . in  @xcite ,",
    "fontaine , kamnitzer and kuperberg studied spiders using an algebro - geometric approach .",
    "for @xmath0 these spiders are exactly the webs in our paper . given a sign string @xmath5 , the _ satake fiber _ @xmath79 , denoted @xmath80 in  @xcite , is isomorphic to the spaltenstein variety @xmath11 mentioned above .",
    "let us point out the difference in these notations that otherwise might confuse the reader : the @xmath12 in  @xcite is equal to @xmath13 in our paper , which is also equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "given a web @xmath81 with boundary corresponding to @xmath5 , fontaine , kamnitzer and kuperberg also defined a variety @xmath82 , called the _ web variety_. one interesting question is the following ( asked to us by kamnitzer ) .",
    "for any two basis webs @xmath83 , does there exist a degree preserving algebra isomorphism @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the decomposition of @xmath1 in section  [ sec : webalgebra ] . the product on @xmath86 is given by convolution .",
    "if the answer to this question is affirmative , then that would be the @xmath0 analogue of the aforementioned result for @xmath10 due to stroppel and webster  @xcite .",
    "our theorem  [ thm : center ] could be a first step towards answering kamnitzer s question .",
    "0.5 cm this paper is organized as follows .    1 .",
    "in section  [ sec : basic ] , we recall the definitions and some fundamental properties of webs , foams and categorified quantum algebras and their categorical representations .",
    "the reader who already knows all this material well enough can just leaf through it , in order to understand our notations and conventions .",

    "sections  [ sec : center ] and  [ sec : grothendieck ] are largely independent of each other . however , the proof of theorem  [ thm : center ] requires proposition  [ prop : morita ] .",
