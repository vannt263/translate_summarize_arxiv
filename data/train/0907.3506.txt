    "the strong interactions at finite temperature are believed to display a number of interesting , non - perturbative phenomena , among which are the confinement / deconfinement transition , spontaneous @xmath0 and @xmath1 violation and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the latter is believed to have its origin in topological fluctuations .",
    "lattice simulations , e.g.  @xcite , and phenomenology , e.g.  @xcite , have shown that the chiral dynamics of qcd is well described by instanton models .",
    "another interesting question related to topological fluctuations is the determination of the axion mass .",
    "axions couple to instantons and their mass is directly proportional to the topological susceptibility .",
    "the latter turns out to be a chiral property of qcd and can thus also be expected to be well described by the iilm .",
    "the main physical question that we want to address is the computation of the topological susceptibility and the systematic effects that pertain to its determination with instanton methods in the chiral regime of light , physical quark masses .",
    "instanton models are based on a combination of semi - classical expansion @xcite and variational approach @xcite . taking this variational path integral as a starting point ,",
    "shuryak investigated what has become known as the interacting instanton liquid model ( iilm ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "many bulk properties were computed and seen to be consistent with the available lattice data and phenomenology .",
    "some recent studies @xcite corroborate the earlier results that the iilm rather accurately describes the chiral properties of qcd , i.e.  that instantons are the dominant degrees of freedom as far as the chiral regime of qcd is concerned",
    ". however , the iilm fails to reproduce confinement .",
    "the topological susceptibility is a key parameter of qcd and has been investigated in many lattice studies .",
    "comparatively few studies have addressed this quantity within the iilm @xcite .",
    "one reason is that , so far , the iilm is based on a canonical ensemble . although one can extract the topological susceptibility from the canonical ensemble through the decay of correlators , e.g.  see @xcite for iilm and @xcite for lattice simulations , it is most natural to use the grand canonical ensemble to study the topological susceptibility .",
    "recent investigations of the iilm in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite were based on canonical simulations and a fugacity expansion , while we will set up a grand canonical iilm that uses grand canonical monte carlo simulations ; see also @xcite for a ` mean - field ' study of the grand - canonical ensemble and @xcite for an exploratory investigation of grand canonical simulations in a simpler framework .    while developing the grand canonical iilm , we have found that the existing finite temperature iilm , @xcite , displays an unphysical behaviour in that it does not allow for a thermodynamic limit .",
    "specifically the instanton  instanton interaction , eq .",
    "( 3.11 ) in @xcite , contains a term that decays very slowly with instanton separation @xmath2 , @xmath3 and is not integrable . in their original paper",
    "the authors do discuss this long - range interaction and point out that they found the @xmath4 dyon  dyon behaviour for a wide range of intermediate separations .",
    "it might well be that the interactions are still well described by this ansatz for the simulation boxes used in subsequent numerical investigations , e.g.  @xcite , but for studying the large volume behaviour it is not appropriate .",
    "we remedy this deficiency by re - deriving the interactions and setting up a numerical framework that avoids using parametric fitting formulas , such as ( [ eq : dyon_dyon_interaction ] ) ; instead we will integrate the lagrangian density for a pair of instantons exactly , i.e.  numerically .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the exact action density for a pair has not been published in the literature before ; we will provide it for harrington ",
    "shepard calorons @xcite .",
    "the explicit form allows us to perform the numerical integration in an efficient way by exploiting the symmetries of the integrand , and an exact analytic computation for widely separated pairs is possible because of the localised nature of the integrands .",
    "hence , the large separation interactions are under very good control .",
    "in particular , the large separation instanton  instanton interaction at finite temperature is not given by ( [ eq : dyon_dyon_interaction ] ) , as we will see more explicitly in the final paper of this series @xcite ; in this paper , however , we will restrict ourselves to zero temperature .",
    "we hope that this framework can be build upon to include the non - trivial holonomy calorons @xcite , which may play part in the confinement / deconfinement phase transition , and for which good fitting formulas will be even harder to come by because of their more complicated structure . as mentioned before , in this series we will restrict ourselves to the harrington  shepard calorons .    in section",
    "[ sec : saturate ] we will review the standard strategy used to derive the partition function for an ensemble of background gauge fields , i.e.  the semi - classical approximation .",
    "we will then re - derive the interactions for the so - called ratio ansatz , used to construct multi - instanton backgrounds from individual instantons , in section [ sec : interactions ] and compare it with other available anstze .",
    "in section [ sec : numerical : implementation ] we present the numerical framework we have set up to deal with the simulations . given that different anstze are available",
    ", we will study their effect on some bulk properties in section [ sec : ansaetze ] and we endeavour to get a handle on systematic uncertainties inherent in this approach .",

    "finite temperature simulations will be dealt with in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the iilm path integral is an approximation to the fundamental path integral by saturating the latter with a given ansatz for the multi - instanton background .",
    "the functional measure consists of small fluctuations around that classical configuration . to make analytical progress ,",
    "the action is expanded to quadratic order to define the ` free ' part that is used in perturbation theory . in general",
    "the background induces non - gaussian fluctuations that need to be treated exactly .",
    "the directions of these zero modes can ( sometimes ) be integrated up , and correspond to the tangent space of a generically non - trivial manifold .",

    "this will lead to new interactions which have no classical counterpart but are purely quantum mechanical ; to 1-loop order , we are allowed to discard them . from this matrix structure",
    "it follows that the jacobian is given by @xmath21 .",
    "now , we do not know the set @xmath22 of exact low lying eigenfunctions . however , we can approximate it by constructing an orthonormal set of the known single particle zero modes that descend from the exact solutions used to build up the background field .",
    "with a slight abuse of notation , we substitute @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the matrix that generates an orthonormal basis from the original set @xmath22 of single particle zero modes .",
    "the jacobian is then given by @xmath25 it corresponds to the quantum mechanical gluonic interactions .",
    "the high - frequency eigenvalues , encoded in the determinant of the fluctuation operator @xmath26 are assumed to be @xmath8-fold degenerate , and so the fluctuation determinant factorises .    in qcd",
    "we also need to introduce quarks and treat their interactions with the background field . in the case where the dirac operator admits quasi - zero modes we can approximate the low frequency part in the same way as for the gluonic case ;",

    "the simplest background configuration is the sum ansatz , as used for instance in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that the sum ansatz produces an unphysical amount of repulsion ; this is due to the fact that the field strength actually diverges at the individual centres , and is in sharp contrast to the individual singular gauge instanton whose field strength is finite at the centre . in this case , the author therefore proposed a different ansatz , inspired by t hooft s multi - instanton form , that stays finite at the centre of the instantons , and dubbed it the ratio ansatz .",

    "these are only available at zero temperature , @xcite @xcite .",
    "phenomenological considerations have lead to the conclusion that the qcd vacuum consists of a dilute ensemble of instantons ; a fact corroborated by lattice studies and self - consistency checks within the iilm .",
    "diluteness and the localised nature of instantons render negligible contributions other than two - body interactions , given here for an instanton  anti - instanton pair , @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",

    "the complete classical gluonic interaction is given by the sum over all the possible pairings .",
    "it is clear from the structure of ( [ eq : ratio ] ) that the colour degrees of freedom can be completely factorised out .",

    "for equal sizes the agreement with @xmath46 is very good , see fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction : gluonic : equal ] .",
    "however , for unequal sizes there are noticeable differences , see fig .  [ fig : interaction : gluonic : unequal ] .",
    "the discrepancy follows from the functional dependence on the size parameters being of the form @xmath54 in @xmath46 .",
    "as can be seen from the asymptotic behaviours , see appendix [ app : interaction : gluonic : asymptotic ] , the sizes enter rather in the combination @xmath55 , at least in the parameter regions of large and small separations ; this is in agreement with @xcite .     in this case",
    ", large differences start to become apparent .",
    "the reason is that the dependence on the sizes is more complicated than the functional form @xmath54 used in @xmath46 .",
    "note that the attractive well is much deeper in the @xmath46 case which will eventually lead to a denser ensemble .",
    "( we have set @xmath50 . ) ]    we will a adopt a couple of simplifications in the practical implementation that have been introduced in previous work .",
    "these are , on the one hand , the approximation of the high - frequency quantum interaction by an inverse running coupling constant evaluated at the scale of the mean instanton size and , on the other hand , the neglect of the jacobian that introduces the collective coordinates and represents the low - frequency quantum interaction .    in the single instanton case the high frequency quantum fluctuations",
    "lead to charge renormalisation and the coupling constant is replaced by the running coupling at the scale given by the instanton size @xcite , @xmath56 . the same calculation has never been performed for a pair . in the original paper @xcite , the interaction part of high - frequency quantum fluctuations have been estimated to be subdominant to the classical interactions . in that paper",
    "the authors argue then that the quantum interaction can be estimated by modulating the ( total ) classical interaction with the inverse running coupling constant , a slowly varying function of the background field , at the scale provided by the mean instanton size @xmath57 .",
    "we will adopt the parametrisation put forth in @xcite that estimates the scale of the running coupling constant on a pair - by - pair basis and uses the geometrical mean of the sizes to set this scale .",
    "the full gluonic interaction is then given by @xmath58    the jacobian interaction is positive by definition and can therefore be interpreted as a repulsive ( low - frequency ) quantum interaction .",
    "a rough estimate of the large distance behaviour suggests that the asymptotic power - law decay is @xmath59 , with @xmath2 the separation between the pair .",
    "this is a faster decay than the well - known dipole ",
    "dipole interaction that follows from the classical action . for strong overlaps",
    "the jacobian matrix will become approximately degenerate , and its determinant small , essentially because the matrix elements of the pair with the other instantons will be roughly equal . for complete degeneracy",
    "the singularity should be logarithmic because one singular value will tend to zero as the rank of the matrix decreases by one .",
    "the repulsion will thus be of the form @xmath60 with proportionality factor of order @xmath61 because , as we argued , the degeneracy is due to one overlapping pair and should not get contributions from other instantons . in ( [ sec : numerical : implementation : interpolation : matching ] ) we will discuss the small separation asymptotic behaviour for the ratio ansatz ; the analytical expressions are given in appendix [ app : interaction : gluonic : small ] , and we note that the singular behaviour is also repulsive and logarithmic , @xmath62 with a proportionality factor that is again of order @xmath61 . in the intermediate region it is harder to estimate the jacobian interaction , but the logarithm should make its contribution subdominant . also , the classical interaction is boosted by the quantum contribution through charge renormalisation .",
    "we conclude that the jacobian interaction is probably negligible compared to the classical interactions .",
    "thus , the gluonic interactions we will use in this work will be given solely by the classical interaction .",
    "the quark interaction arises from ( [ eq : quark : overlap ] ) , as is clear from our discussion in section [ sec : saturate ] , and is purely quantum mechanical .",
    "as for the gluonic interaction , some further approximations have been used in the literature ; we will adopt these , albeit rephrased sightly differently .",
    "we will assume that the single instanton zero modes @xmath63 form a functional orthonormal basis , i.e.  we neglect contributions arising from non - vanishing overlaps among the @xmath64 . with this in mind ,",

    "( we have set @xmath50 . ) ]    the rather large difference between @xmath44 and @xmath46 , see top of fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap : quark ] , is due to the fact that the latter use a sum ansatz .",
    "the ratio ansatz was introduced to remove the unphysical divergence in the field strength ; no such problem afflicts the overlap matrix elements . on top of that the quark determinant",
    "is a pre - exponential factor and as an effective interaction the extra logarithmic factor should make it rather insensitive to its exact form , see @xcite . within our numerical framework , the full ratio ansatz does not produce any additional overhead and has the merit to be more consistent with the gluonic interactions .",
    "we have checked that upon neglect of the contributions special to the ratio ansatz , i.e.  simplifying the overlaps so as to recover the sum ansatz , our results agree very well with those of @xmath46 , apart form the aforementioned discrepancy in the instanton size parametrisation . as for the gluonic interactions , the colour matrices could again be completely factorised out .     and @xmath46 is not as pronounced , i.e.",
    "the relative difference has decreased substantially .",
    "we can clearly see that light quark masses lead to a stronger attractive interaction between instantons and anti - instantons .",

    "the instantons have been set up with equal sizes .",

    "therefore the quark fluctuation operator has the following form @xmath78 with @xmath79 the @xmath80 matrix of overlaps @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is the number of instantons ( anti - instantons ) ; the @xmath84-matrices are @xmath85 and @xmath86 dimensional , respectively ; finally , @xmath87 is the identity operator on the quasi - zero mode space of dimension @xmath88 . to diagonalise @xmath74[c]{$d$}\\makebox[0ex][c]{$\\slash$}\\hspace*{0.5\\mywidth}}$ ] , it suffices to know the singular - value - decomposition of @xmath79 .",

    "if we are only interested in the determinant , and not so much in the eigensystem , this can be put in the equivalent form @xmath102    upon placing this term into the exponential , the normalised determinant of quark zero mode overlaps leads to an effective interaction .",
    "the normalisation consists of dividing ( [ eq : interaction : quark : determinant ] ) by @xmath103 .",
    "the quark interaction is thus given by @xmath104 with @xmath105 the number of active quark flavours .",
    "note that the quark interaction is always attractive .",
    "this follows from the fact that we can write the overlap matrix for each flavour as @xmath106 , and this form makes it explicit that the determinant is bounded from below by unity because the smallest eigenvalue is easily seen to satisfy @xmath107 .",
    "this exhausts the interactions in the iilm because the fluctuation operator of the ghost part is positive definite and its lack of zero modes prevents the construction of the low frequency part of the spectrum within the moduli - space approximation .",
    "we are thus left with the high - frequency part which , as in the other cases , is assumed to factorise and can not lead to interactions .",
    "the decoupling of the colour degrees of freedom is a computational benefit : by using global @xmath108 transformations , without loss of generality , we place the first instanton at the origin and the second along the @xmath109-direction . the initial orientational dependence is then factored out of the integrand and combines with the colour matrices as in @xcite .",
    "these integrations are too time consuming to perform during actual simulations ; instead , they are computed beforehand to fill interpolation tables that are , in turn , used during the simulations .",
    "the interpolation grid is three - dimensional , and depends on @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . for numerical stability",
    "we choose to use simple linear interpolation .    a uniform grid can , of course , only extend over a finite region and we must decide which portion of the parameter space to cover .",
    "we took the single instanton moduli - space measure as a guide for the size grid because , suitably normalised , it can be interpreted as a probability density .",
    "we choose the lower limit , @xmath113 , to be a fairly small quantile . here , @xmath114 is the scale at which qcd starts to become strongly coupled .",
    "the upper limit is set to @xmath115 .",
    "larger instantons can not be treated consistently in the iilm because it uses perturbation theory , which breaks down below @xmath114 .",
    "we believe that these choices cover the relevant parameter space , and we sample the sizes from the interval @xmath116 $ ] . as a consistency check we monitored the actual size distribution and did not find any evidence for a significant weight at the edges of the sample interval .",
    "we therefore conclude that this procedure is well - defined .",
    "the classical gluonic interaction in the ratio ansatz suffers from gauge singularities that prevent us from extending the grid down to vanishingly small instanton separations , @xmath117 .",
    "the opposite limit , @xmath118 , can not be covered either unless we use a non - uniform measure on @xmath119 . in principle",
    "this would seem like the most elegant approach , however , it is not feasible practically because the numerical integration becomes inaccurate at larger separations ; the only remedy would be to set very small error tolerances for the numerical integrations , but that is computationally prohibitive .",
    "therefore , we decided to use matching formulas for both the large and small separation regimes .",
    "the rationale is not to derive accurate formulas in absolute terms but to get the absolute value from the interpolation results at a matching point @xmath120 .",
    "the matching formulas are thus to be understood as accurate in a relative sense , i.e.  the asymptotic interactions @xmath121 should behave , asymptotically , like the exact numerical interactions @xmath122 .",
    "this ensures that we reproduce the correct fall - off or singularity behaviour .",

    "since the localisation of the instantons is set by the sizes , it is natural for the matching point to be proportional to the former .",
    "eventually , the exact proportionality factor follows from an ` optimisation ' procedure , given that we aim for the interpolated interactions to be correct at the one percent level .",
    "the full gluonic interaction consists of different pieces that are added together , ( [ eq : interaction : gluonic : density ] )",
    ". we could use ( [ eq : asymptotic : matching ] ) for these subinteractions term by term but it turns out that such a matching is numerically rather unstable .",

    "region i accounts for possible singularities . after adding up all the different subinteractions , the singularities from region i dominate the total interaction .",

    "the quark overlap consists of just one term , which is not well described in region i. we estimated that the correct asymptotic behaviour can be obtained at second order .",
    "however , this is unnecessary since the quark interaction is bounded in that region and the gluonic interaction completely dominates . combining the gluonic and fermionic interactions",
    ", we see that the total pair interaction is accurate on the one percent level .",
    "note that we use interpolation up to very strong overlaps ; also , instantons rarely enter region i during simulations because it makes up a very small part of the total volume box . in any case ,",
    "region i overlaps will almost certainly be rejected in monte carlo moves , and therefore quantities that are computed solely from the quark interaction , as for instance the quark condensate , are very insensitive to large errors in region i. ultimately , this is the reason why we chose the interpolation grid to cover such strong overlaps .",
    "previous studies , lattice results and phenomenology indicate that the instanton ensemble is fairly dilute . therefore , we organise the partition function into a dilute gas measure times the exponential of interactions , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is given in ( [ eq : interaction : gluonic ] ) and @xmath143 is given in ( [ eq : interaction : quark ] ) .",

    "more precisely , we will use the metropolis algorithm to sample the important integration regions of the partition function .",
    "this is , of course , all well known , but it seems appropriate to introduce the , possibly less known , monte carlo moves corresponding to insertion and deletion of instantons needed for grand canonical simulations .    following the usual strategy of imposing detailed balance , the simplest insertion / deletion algorithm consists of randomly placing an instanton in the box and randomly selecting an instanton to be removed . imposing detailed balance and considering the case of an instanton",
