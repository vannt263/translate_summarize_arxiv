    "observations of l dwarfs with effective temperatures of 1400 - 2200 k have led to the investigations of dust condensates in their atmospheres @xcite . because of complete gravitational settling , grains are expected to condense beyond the visible atmosphere for objects with effective temperatures below 1400 k. at higher effective temperatures , grains can be present in the visible atmosphere due to incomplete gravitational settling @xcite .    using a thermodynamical model based on homogeneous and heterogeneous condensation assumptions , ( * ? ? ? *",

    "using solutions of dust moment equations in a static atmosphere , @xcite studied the continuous nucleation of solid particles from the gas phase . by imposing the requirement of minimum mixing activities and thermodynamical stability , they were able to determine the upper boundary ( called `` cloud deck '' ) and the lower boundary ( called `` cloud base '' ) respectively .",
    "the possibility of detecting polarization at optical from grains in the atmospheres of l dwarfs was first raised by @xcite .",
    "since fast rotation of l dwarfs @xcite will induce the shape of their photosphere into the form of an oblate ellipsoid , this non - sphericity will lead to incomplete cancellation of the polarization from different areas of the stellar surface .",
    "this prediction was first confirmed by the detection of linear polarization at 768 nm from a few l dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , have reported r and i band detection of linear polarization from several l dwarfs . since polarization in",
    "the optical is unlikely to be due to zeeman splitting of atomic or molecular lines or by synchrotron radiation , the observed polarization can best be explained by single dust scattering in a rotationally induced oblate atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the observed polarization of denis - p j0255 - 4700 and 2massw j0036 + 1821 was modeled by @xcite by assuming minimum oblateness of these objects based on a model of complete degeneracy of a non - relativistic polytropic gas under hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the observed degree of polarization was obtained by considering different parameters for the scale height , number density , and mean radius of the grains . by minimizing the oblateness and the number density of grains , an upper limit on the mean grain radius that is consistent with the polarization observed by @xcite",
    "was obtained .",
    "however , the process of dust condensation was not considered .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present detailed theoretical models of optical linear polarization from l dwarfs of spectral types ranging from l0 to l6 based on the dust condensation model of c03 . with this model",
    ", we fit the observed polarization from several l dwarfs and predict the amount of polarization expected from any l dwarfs with given rotational velocity .    in section 2",
    ", we present the formalism for the calculation of polarization from single dust scattering in an oblate medium . in section 3",

    "the estimation of rotationally induced oblateness is presented in section 4 , and the dust model parameters are described in section 5 . the results and discussions are presented in section 6 , followed by conclusions in section 7 .",
    "if a stellar object is perfectly spherical then the net polarization would be zero due to the cancellation of the contribution of each point on the photosphere .",
    "the observation of non - zero polarization from a few l dwarfs therefore suggests that the scattering geometry is asymmetric , which could be the result of fast rotation of the objects .",
    "since the dust density is low and scattering by atoms and molecules does not contribute to polarization significantly , single scattering approximation is reasonable for the region where the optical depth @xmath0 .",
    "if present , multiple scattering can reduce the degree of polarization by a few orders of magnitude @xcite because the planes of the scattering events are randomly oriented and average each other s contribution out from the final polarization .",

    "the effective temperature @xmath41 is used and hence the degree of polarization should be considered strictly as a function of @xmath41 rather than the spectral type .    the surface gravity of l dwarfs older than about a few hundred million years varies from @xmath42 cm s@xmath43 to @xmath44 cm s@xmath43 .",

    "this is mainly because of the fact that the presence of dust cloud affects the radiative equilibrium of the upper atmosphere and hence alters the t - p profile from that of a cloud - free atmosphere . on the other hand , the t - p profile dictates the position and the chemical equilibrium of condensates .",
    "allard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented atmospheric models for two limiting cases , e. g. , one with inefficient gravitational settling wherein the dust is distributed according to chemical equilibrium predictions ( ames - dusty ) and another with efficient gravitational settling in which situation dust has no effect on the thermal structure ( ames  cond ) .",
    "@xcite have proposed a unified cloudy model ( ucm ) in which the segregation of dust from the gaseous mixture takes place in all the ultra - cool dwarfs and at about the same critical temperature .    in the present work ,",
    "the temperature - pressure profiles for the l dwarfs with different spectral type are calculated by solving the non - lte radiative transfer equations coupled with the hydrostatic equilibrium equations .",
    "we have employed the full mie theory , incorporating the dust opacity as well as the mie phase function .",
    "the calculations are first performed by taking only gas opacities .",
    "we have adopted the atmospheric opacity sources discussed in @xcite and assumed solar metallicity .",

    "nevertheless , the polarization profile would change depending on the chemical equilibrium procedure adopted in different atmospheric models .",
    "the observation of non - zero polarization from unresolved objects indicates the non - sphericity of the photosphere . the non - sphericity may results from several causes .",
    "for example , rotation of a stellar object will result in a shape of an oblate ellipsoid , as is evident in the outer solar planets . at 1 bar pressure level ,",
    "the eccentricity of jupiter , saturn and uranus are 0.35 , 0.43 and 0.21 respectively . apart from rotational effects , tidal interaction with the companion in a binary system",

    "the observation of optical polarization from l dwarfs with known projected angular velocity implies non - sphericity of the photosphere due to rotation .",

    "the effect of other species on the degree of polarization is discussed later .",
    "we have used the data from c03 for forsterite : @xmath81 g mol@xmath47 , @xmath82 g @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( assuming solar abundance distribution of the elements as discussed in c03 ) . throughout our investigation",

    "is observed by @xcite at r band ( centered at 0.641 @xmath86 ) as well as at i band ( centered at 0.85 @xmath86 ) .",
    "the same object is observed by @xcite at i band ( centered at 0.768 @xmath86 ) .",
    "therefore , for this object we model the degree of polarization at different wavelengths .",
    "the real part of the refractive index is fixed at 1.65 and the imaginary part is taken by interpolating the data given in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the refractive index of amorphous condensates might differ under different physical conditions .",
    "apart from the calculation of the grain number density , the location of the cloud in the atmosphere plays an important role in determining the amount of polarization .",
    "the location of the cloud base for different atmospheric models and different chemical species is determined by the intersection of the t - p profile of the atmosphere model and the condensation curve @xmath73 as prescribed in c03 .",
    "taking the condensation curve for forsterite , we determine the base of the cloud for each spectral type , from l0 to l8 .",
    "figure  [ pbase ] presents the atmospheric pressure height at which the cloud base is situated for models with different spectral types .",
    "as the effective temperature decreases from l0 to l8 , the cloud base is pushed deeper into the atmosphere . according to the condensation curve given in c03 ,",
    "the base of forsterite cloud for a l8 object ( @xmath871480 k ) is situated at about 10.0 bar pressure height when the surface gravity of the object is assumed to be @xmath45 cm s@xmath43 . for a similar model , @xcite found the base of tio@xmath78 at 9.4 bar pressure height .",
    "similarly , for a l4 ( @xmath881820 k ) object , the forsterite cloud base is found to be situated at 2.2 bar while @xcite found it to be at 2.7 bar for tio@xmath78 cloud .",
    "theoretical investigation @xcite claims that the thickness of the dust clouds and hence the location of the cloud deck influences the spectral energy distribution of l and t dwarfs .",
    "also , it is suggested that the vertical height of dust cloud may vary for a given @xmath41 and surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization too is strongly dependent on the vertical height of the dust cloud and hence on the location of the cloud deck . in c03 ,",
    "the cloud deck is considered to be at one scale height above the base .",
    "the condensation curve @xmath73 decreases exponentially with the decrease in the atmospheric temperature and the value of @xmath73 become negligibly small at @xmath89 . for different atmospheric models ,",
    "this temperature is attained at different atmospheric pressure height .",
    "the position of the cloud deck for different spectral types is also presented in figure 2 . from figure  [ pbase ]",
    "we note that the thickness of the cloud decreases as one goes from l8 to l0 .",
    "in other words , the thickness of the dust cloud decreases with the increase in effective temperature for a fixed value of surface gravity . for l dwarfs hotter than l2",
    ", the cloud is very thin , much less than one scale height . for a l8 object",
    ", the forsterite cloud deck is calculated to be situated at about 4 bar pressure height . for a similar atmospheric model ,",
    "@xcite calculated the tio@xmath78 cloud deck at 0.24 bar . for a l4 object",
    "the forsterite cloud deck in our model is at 0.5 bar pressure height while the tio@xmath78 cloud deck calculated by @xcite for a similar object is at 0.1 bar .",
    "therefore the cloud thickness in our model is smaller than that of @xcite .",
    "the number density of tio@xmath78 grains for l4 and l8 objects is presented graphically in woitke & helling ( 2004 ) .    at present",
    ", there is no convincing justification in favor of any specific form of the particle size distribution function .",
    "c03 considered a particle size distribution function that is consistent with the measurements of grain distribution attained in earth s water clouds while ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) and saumon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) considered a broad lognormal size distribution . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the size distribution function given by the latter authors which is expressed as : @xmath90\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the diameter of the particles and @xmath92 is the mean diameter , @xmath93 is fixed at 1.3 that provides good fit to the red spectrum of l dwarfs .",
    "in a heterogeneously condensing cloud model with forsterite as the dominant constituent , the number density of grains , the cloud base and its vertical scale height are fixed .",
    "the remaining free parameters are the mean particle diameter @xmath92 and the oblateness induced by rotation . as discussed by c03 , the particle sizes significantly vary with the effective temperature , surface gravity and vertical height of the dust cloud . in the present work we have calculated the degree of polarization for a fixed surface gravity",
    "@xmath42 cm s@xmath47 . figure 4 shows how the degree of polarization is altered with different mean particle diameter for objects with different spectral type and hence for different effective temperature . in a multiple scattering scenario ,",
    "it is important to consider different mean particle size at different pressure scale .",
    "however , in a single scattering , the photon scatters only with one particle and therefore , for a fixed effective temperature , a fixed mean particle size is sufficient .",
    "this means that at every atmospheric pressure level , we use the lognormal distribution with particle mean diameter @xmath92 .",
    "we have included contributions to polarization by multipoles @xmath94=2 , 4 and 6 in eq .  [ pol ] .",
    "however , it is found that at optical wavelengths and for the particle size needed to account the observed polarization , contribution from @xmath95 is dominant over that of higher values for @xmath94 .",
    "the projected rotational velocity for several l dwarfs has been determined from observational data . in the absence of any knowledge on the inclination angle ,",
    "the actual rotational velocity can not be determined , yielding uncertainties in the oblateness . in the present work we have considered rotational velocity of 15 , 25 , 30 , 40 and 50 km s@xmath47 .",
    "figure  5 and figure  6 show how the degree of polarization significantly increases with the increase in rotational velocity .",
    "a comparison of the degree of polarization presented in figure  5 and figure  6 shows that if the mean particle diameter is increased , the degree of polarization decreases significantly because with the increase in grain size , the grain number density reduces according to eq .",
    "[ density ] .    as mentioned in section 5 , the location of the cloud base plays an important role in determining the degree of polarization .",
    "as one moves from l0 to l8 , the cloud base goes deeper in the atmosphere owing to the decrease in effective temperature .",
    "this makes the vertical size of the cloud larger ( figure  2 ) and hence substantial increase in the total number of dust grains . in figure  3 , we show how the degree of polarization is altered when the cloud base is changed but the particle number density remains unaltered . for an object of spectral type l4.0 ( @xmath87 1820 k ) with surface gravity",
    "@xmath96 cm s@xmath43 , the cloud base should be situated at an atmospheric temperature about 1750 k. keeping the particle number density the same as that calculated for l4 object , we calculated the degree of polarization by varying the location of the cloud base .",
    "the degree of polarization is found to increase as the location of the cloud base is pushed to the deeper in the atmosphere where the temperature increases from 1600 k to 1800 k. this implies that as one moves from l8 to l0 , that is from cooler to hotter dwarfs , the degree of polarization decreases owing to the decrease in the vertical height of the dust cloud .    as mentioned in section 1 , menard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the first time , detected linear polarization from three l dwarfs .",

    "the object 2mass j2252 - 17 belong to the spectral type l 7.5 .",

    "larger grain size would have made the polarization to peak at longer wavelength .",
    "the degree of polarization increases with the decrease in the polytropic index because with @xmath56 , the oblateness of the object is higher than that with @xmath58 for the same rotational velocity and surface gravity .",
    "on the other hand sengupta ( 2003 ) showed that the oblateness decreases with the increase in surface gravity yielding into less amount of polarization .",
    "as mentioned before , we have considered only forsterite in our models as it is very common in the atmosphere of l type dwarfs with solar metalicity .",
    "this is because of large abundances of mg , si and o. however , gehlenite , enstatite etc",
    ". should also be present in the atmosphere in fairly good abundance .",
    "the condensation curve presented in c03 shows that the base of gehlenite is situated much deeper in the atmosphere than that of forsterite yielding into a larger verticle size of the cloud .",
    "further , iron with higher refractivity may undercircle most of the silicate clouds .",
    "inclusion of all these will lead to substantial increase in degree of polarization and therefore , much smaller grain size may be needed in order to explain the observed degree of polarization .",
    "lastly , multiple scattering will lead to much less polarization and therefore in order to fit the observed polarization one has to either consider much higher oblateness of the objects or has to increase the grain number density substantially . an increase in grain number density",
    "needs smaller grain size which may contradict the present theoretical understanding on the nature and formation of dust grain . on the other hand , differential photometric observation of several l dwarfs",
    "could not detect any non - periodic variability of many objects that show high polarization .",
    "this indicates optically thin dust shell and therefore polarization by single dust scattering is quite reasonable .",
    "we have investigated the optical linear polarization from l dwarfs of different spectral type by considering single dust scattering .",
    "forsterite is considered to be the dominant species among the various condensates that could be present in the atmosphere of l dwarfs .",
    "the location of the cloud base and the cloud deck is determined from the condensation curve for forsterite and the atmospheric temperature - pressure profiles of different spectral types .",
    "the surface gravity is fixed at @xmath45 cm s@xmath43 and a wide range of rotational velocity is considered .",
    "it is found that the degree of linear polarization decreases from hotter to cooler l dwarfs .",
    "however , l dwarfs with effective temperature greater than 2200 k should not show detectable amount of polarization due to dust scattering as most of the dust would either evaporate from the atmosphere or condensation is not favored at such high temperature .",
    "it is found that the mean diameter of grains that is consistent with the observed polarization should not exceed a few micron although a small amount of very large grains at the base of the cloud for comparatively cooler l dwarfs may well be accommodated .",
    "however , the observational data of 2mass j0036 + 1821 clearly indicates the presence of sub - micron size grain .",
    "further polarimetric observation at the optical and at other wavelengths would provide convincing information on the properties and distribution of dust in the atmosphere of l dwarfs .",
