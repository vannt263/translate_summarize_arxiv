    "the luttinger liquid ( ll ) is one of the best understood strongly correlated system and departs strikingly from the more familiar landau fermi liquid with features such as spin - charge separation and charge fractionalization @xcite . of interest",
    "is the exploration of luttinger physics in a mesoscopic context : several materials at the mesoscopic scale such as the quantum wires or the carbon nanotubes have been indeed proposed as realizations of a luttinger liquid@xcite . in this",
    "regard ac transport probes are an important tool because they allow access to the non - equilibrium physics of the ll .    in this paper",
    "we propose to discuss ac transport in a luttinger liquid resistively connected to two reservoirs through arbitrary interface resistances ( not necessarily quantized at half a quantum of resistance ) : we will consider in turn ( i ) a gated luttinger liquid , ( ii ) the response when one disconnects one of the reservoirs and ( iii ) application of an arbitrary ac electric field along the sample .    the first calculation for settings ( i ) and ( iii ) was done by ponomarenko using the inhomogeneous luttinger liquid model , where one models the reservoirs as 1d non - interacting fermi systems@xcite .",
    "his results for the gated wire were later recovered using rpa by blanter , hekking and bttiker@xcite and using the inhomogeneous ll model and then a boundary conditions formalism by safi@xcite ; the case of a constant electric field was also considered by sablikov and shchamkhalova with results consistent with ponomarenko s ; appealing to shockley s theorem they however claim that the real current measured at an electrode is not given by the electron current but add a displacement current contribution due to a charging of the reservoir caused by the charging of the wire itself : for a uniform electric field this results in a net current measured equal to a spatial average of the current through the wire@xcite .",
    "another approach has been advocated by cuniberti , sasseti and kramer who consider an infinite system with long - range interactions and compute an absorptive conductance which has the advantage of being measurable by absorption of electromagnetic radiations without application of voltage or current probes@xcite .",
    "an interesting development in several of these groups has been a focus on both capacitive and inductive effects with consideration of the kinetic inductance of a ll @xcite .",
    "a transmission line approach to ac transport in a ll has also been proposed by burke@xcite to investigate the plasmon physics of ll based on earlier works on single - walled@xcite and multi - walled carbon nanotubes@xcite ; the ll is modelled as a rl line coupled capacitively to a ground voltage .",
    "additionally burke discusses plasmon damping , a topic rather unexplored so far in that context .",
    "inclusion of coulomb interactions has also been considered in several papers@xcite .    in the case of short - range interactions ( the pure ll )",
    "it is noteworthy that the dc limit of earlier calculations corresponds to contact resistances quantized at @xmath7 the quantum of resistance ( or equivalently to interface sample - electrode resistances @xmath8 ) .",
    "we consider in this paper a more general situation by allowing for interface resistances distinct from @xmath8 : while leaving open the experimental possibility that interface resistances are quantized at @xmath8 , this permits dirty contacts to electrodes , which a priori is a not too unreasonable assumption .",
    "we generalize earlier expressions for the dynamical conductance in situations ( i ) and ( iii ) above@xcite , and additionally compute the dynamical impedance .",
    "case ( ii ) where only one electrode is connected is considered because it is a setting paradigmatic of time - dependent transport where the role of displacement currents is especially clear . for case ( i )",
    "we show explicitly that to second order in frequency the ll can be represented by an equivalent electrical circuit comprised of interface resistances @xmath9 and @xmath1 connected in series to an intrinsic inductance ( per unit length ) @xmath10 ( which is not purely kinetic but includes the effect of interactions ) , the whole being capacitively coupled to the ground through an intrinsic ll capacitance ( per unit length ) @xmath11 .",
    "( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this shows explicitly from first principles the validity of the transmission line analogy considered by burke up to order two in a low - frequency expansion@xcite ( our results however do not assume galilean invariance which implies in turn the relation @xmath12 for the fermi velocity ) .",
    "this in turn shows that ac measurements of both the dynamical gate conductance @xmath13 and the impedance of the system up to order two in frequency allow full determination of the luttinger liquid parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the plasmon velocity and interaction strength ) and of the interface resistances @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the expected parallel law addition for the charge relaxation resistance is explicitly recovered as @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce a boundary condition formalism which allows for the modelling of reservoirs resistively contacted to the luttinger liquid .",
    "we discuss the gated luttinger liquid computing both dynamical conductance and impedance matrices , as well as the ll connected to a single reservoir .",
    "we impose an ac electric field .",
    "we consider the standard luttinger hamiltonian for a wire of length @xmath14 . @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 is a gate potential which controls the fermi level of the ll , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are chiral particle densities which obey the relation @xmath19 .",
    "their sum is just the total particle density @xmath20 while the electrical current is simply @xmath21 .",
    "we now define the following operators :    @xmath22 physically they correspond to ( canonical ) chemical potential operators : their average value yields the energy needed to add a particle locally at position @xmath23 to the chiral density : @xmath24 .",
    "similar operators have been introduced in safi s boundary conditions formalism@xcite : the main difference being that we consider chiral chemical potentials linked to the eigenmodes of the luttinger liquid while she defines chemical potentials related to the left or right moving ( bare ) electrons .",
    "such chiral operators are much more convenient for calculations since they are directly related to the ll eigenmodes .    from their definition",
    "it follows that : @xmath25 and therefore : @xmath26 it is convenient to redefine the chemical potentials by taking @xmath16 as reference : @xmath27 and using the fact that these shifted operators have a chiral time evolution : @xmath28 it follows immediately that :    @xmath29      up to now the luttinger liquid is free standing . in real experimental settings coupling to probes is however unavoidable but in the absence of an exact solution of the problem of a mesoscopic ll wire coupled to many electrodes we decide to model the coupling to reservoirs through boundary conditions imposed on the otherwise free standing luttinger liquid .    to enforce that we appeal to sharvin - imry contact resistance@xcite : at the interface between a reservoir and a ballistic wire",
    "there is a voltage drop between the electrode voltage and the mean chemical potential within the wire ; for a two - terminal geometry this in turn implies the existence of a contact resistance which can be viewed as the series addition of two interface resistances . for constrictions adiabatically connected to the reservoirs the contact resistance is quantized as @xmath30 . but",
    "in general it need not be ; as shown by bttiker incoherent transport through barriers can affect quantization@xcite .    for the ll we therefore make the hypothesis that as far as transport is concerned the resistive coupling to reservoirs",
    "can be modelled as :    @xmath31    in the above equations we have considered two electrodes connected at the boundaries of the ll , the left electrode being a source at voltage @xmath32 and the right electrode being a drain at voltage @xmath33 .",
    "currents are oriented from left to right .",
    "we stress that these relations are operator ones : we work therefore in the heisenberg representation . for computation of noise properties it is indeed crucial that these relations are enforced at the operator level and not as average ; knowledge of a current average",
    "is insufficient to specify fluctuation properties .",
    "these relations extend an earlier formalism developed by the author and collaborators@xcite : the main difference is that earlier we considered the chemical potentials as uniform ( as is the case in a dc context ) in a grand - canonical approach while here we work in a canonical setting with local potentials , which is more suitable to the ac context .",
    "we note in passing that such relations can be derived explicitly in several exactly solvable models : for instance for the inhomogeneous luttinger liquid with interface resistances @xmath34 ; for a chiral luttinger liquid connected by a point contact to a fermi liquid with @xmath35 or more generally for a reservoir which is a ll with ll parameter @xmath36 also connected through a point contact to the sample , the interface resistance is @xmath37 .",
    "safi s boundary conditions@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the _ electron densities at the right and left fermi points ( and not the chiral densities ) _ coincide with our boundary conditions for the special values @xmath34 . for a detailed discussion of these relations we refer to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "simple though these relations may seem they permit to go beyond earlier ac results found by using for instance the inhomogeneous ll model as will next be shown .",
    "we now consider time - varying voltage sources @xmath40 and @xmath41 and a gate voltage @xmath42 and compute the dynamical impedance and conductance matrices of the ll .",
    "the currents at the boundaries of the system then acquire the same time dependence ; we define currents as entering the system : @xmath43    to enforce current conservation there will in general be a displacement current corresponding to the charging of the sample . in that section",
    "we fix the currents at the boundaries as @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the voltages @xmath46 and @xmath41 can be viewed as responses to the currents .",
    "the boundary conditions are therefore rewritten as : @xmath47 using eq.([current - def ] ) and eq.([chemical ] ) it follows that : @xmath48 defining the vector @xmath49 as : @xmath50 and using eq.([chemical],[boundary],[shifted - chem ] ) there follows : @xmath51 inserting eq.([current - mu ] ) , there comes : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are resistances measured against the quantum of resistance @xmath55 .",
    "inverting now eq.([current - mu ] ) and inserting it in eq.([v - mu ] ) one gets : @xmath56    defining the dynamical impedance matrix as : @xmath57 one finally finds : @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the length of the system , and @xmath2 is the plasmon velocity ) .",
    "this is the main result of this sub - section .",
    "we now consider the following experimental arrangement in order to measure the impedance of the ll : @xmath61 .",
    "the impedance of the system is therefore related to the matrix elements of the full impedance matrix by : @xmath62 and therefore : @xmath63    that especially simple formula admits as low frequency limit : @xmath64 where @xmath14 is the size of the system .",
    "comments :    \\(i ) this shows firstly that the total contact resistance results as it should be from a series addition of the two interface resistances @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "\\(ii ) secondly , since @xmath65 there appears an inductance per unit length :    @xmath66    this is as it should be ; indeed direct inspection of the luttinger hamiltonian shows that the luttinger liquid must have an inductance precisely set at that value . indeed : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the difference between bare right and left electron densities ( at right and left fermi points @xmath69 ) . rewriting the hamiltonian in terms of charge density and current : @xmath70 ( the last expression follows from charge conservation and the equations of motion ) there follows : @xmath71",
    "this shows indeed an inductance per unit length @xmath72 while the zero mode of the first term yields @xmath73 which shows there is a capacitance per unit length : @xmath74 while there has been ample emphasis on the intrinsic capacitance of the luttinger liquid@xcite the fact that the ll possesses an intrinsic inductance is less well stressed : see however@xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the term @xmath75 in the hamiltonian results from both kinetic energy and interactions : the inductance @xmath76 has therefore a mixed origin and is not merely contrarily to what burke argues a kinetic inductance @xcite : this point is somewhat obscured by the fact that in galilean invariant systems @xmath77 which implies then that the intrinsic ll inductance assumes exactly the same value as in a non - interacting system ; however since galilean invariance is in general not realized the previous identity does not hold and a renormalization by the interactions of the kinetic inductance should follow . at any rate whether experiments can provide independent measurements of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 : therefore one need not assume that @xmath77 , since the validity or non - validity of that relation can be checked .",
    "\\(iii ) for carbon nanotubes assuming a length @xmath78 and a plasmon velocity of the order of @xmath79 means that each successive term in the low - frequency expansion of the impedance goes as @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that at already a frequency of about @xmath81 the inductive correction is @xmath82 . while the first order correction is quite measurable the next order ( three ) correction is much less accessible unless one goes to the @xmath83 range .",
    "we now fix voltages ; therefore the relation @xmath84 is not valid any more . as amply stressed by bttiker",
    "there is a displacement current @xmath85 due to the charging of the system@xcite .",
    "current conservation is enforced only if one considers that additional current .",
    "one now inverts the relation @xmath86 ; whence the upper @xmath87 part of the dynamical conductance matrix : @xmath88 @xmath89    using current conservation @xmath90 the full conductance matrix follows : @xmath91 with matrix elements : @xmath92 } { \\left (   \\frac{1}{2}+k\\overline{r_{s}}\\right ) \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}+k\\overline{r_{d}}% \\right ) -\\exp",

    "we now expand the gate conductance @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the contact resistance .",
    "the previous expression shows :    \\(i ) firstly that the capacitance per unit length @xmath103 is independent of the coupling to the reservoirs : this is quite sensible ; its value is just that expected from a direct inspection of the luttinger hamiltonian ( see above ) .",
    "measurement of both @xmath76 and @xmath100 therefore provides a direct way to get the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as already noticed by burke using the telegraphist equation@xcite the plasmon velocity is just @xmath104 an identity well - known to electrical engineers while the transmission line impedance is just : @xmath105 .",
    "this justifies a posteriori the transmission line analogy proposed by burke .",
    "note however that our results show that the transmission line analogy is valid only up to order two in a low frequency expansion .",
    "\\(ii ) that capacitance @xmath106 is fully chemical and corresponds to ( the inverse of ) the density of states : as stressed by bttiker@xcite in a general experimental setting one has to add a geometrical capacitance describing the coupling to a wire so that the total capacitance is @xmath107 .",
    "\\(iii ) there appears a charge relaxation resistance @xmath5 which obeys a parallel addition law : @xmath108 .",
    "this is quite sensible because relaxation probabilities should add for independent relaxation processes .",
    "the charge relaxation resistance is distinct from the contact resistance in that it corresponds to an @xmath109 time for the discharging of a system and not ( directly ) to energy dissipation@xcite .",
    "we also observe that by measuring both impedance and gate conductance up to order two in frequency one can directly measure both interface resistances : there is therefore no need to assume that they are a priori set at @xmath110 since this can be checked experimentally .",
    "\\(iv ) several approaches have been advocated for determining the luttinger parameters using ac measurements .",
    "ponomarenko@xcite , sablikov and shchamkhalova@xcite proposed to measure the period of the conductance since they are oscillating functions of the parameter @xmath111 .",
    "this has been criticized by blanter et al . who argue that the frequency is quite high ( ghz range)@xcite .",
    "safi proposed to measure the conductance at low frequency and measure its deviation to the dc limit@xcite , by showing that at low frequency for a symmetric electric field arrangement one can neglect the displacement current so that @xmath112 : this allows access to the product @xmath113.blanter et al .",
    "argued that such deviations are hard to identify and proposed to measure the gate conductance up to order three@xcite to determine the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    as is apparent from our discussion of the inductance of the luttinger liquid a joint measurement of both impedance and gate conductance",
    "circumvents the need to go to order three in frequency : it is sufficient to go to order one , which means that measurements at the khz range should be enough rather than the 100 ghz range . that measurement of the impedance is equivalent to the measurement of @xmath114 proposed by safi with the advantage that fixing the currents as in an impedance measurement avoids the complications of displacement current .",
    "in addition note that our derivation does not require a symmetric configuration for the electrodes .",
    "\\(v ) but if conversely one is able to make measurements up to order three ( i.e. up to @xmath115 , or at @xmath83 range ) , the order third term instead of providing a _ mere fit _ of the ll theory to experiments now constitutes a distinct non - trivial prediction of the theory . but as is obvious from eq.([gate ] ) instead of the simpler expression @xmath116 given by blanter et al . , charge relaxation and contact resistances enter in an intricate way if they do not take the trivial values @xmath117 and @xmath118 . the same comment applies to the dynamical impedance : @xmath119 we note in passing that the appearance of @xmath120 in the formula can be understood quite simply as the translation of inductive corrections since @xmath121 .      that experimental setting is especially interesting because in the dc limit there is no current .",
    "the dynamics within an ac experiment is wholly governed by the charge dynamics within the sample and illustrates nicely the role of the displacement current as stressed by bttiker@xcite .    to the author s knowledge such a setting for",
    "a ll has not been treated in the literature even in the case of @xmath122 . yet in our formalism that situation is quite straightforwardly described : it suffices to take the limit of infinite interface resistance @xmath1 if one wants for instance to disconnect the drain electrode .",
    "no current can flow into the drain and the current @xmath123 is therefore zero .",
    "the only non - zero matrix elements of the dynamical conductance are @xmath124 and are determined by a single number : @xmath125 in that situation the incoming current charges the luttinger liquid and therefore @xmath126 the displacement current compensates exactly the charge current .",
    "the impedance @xmath127 is the inverse of @xmath128 : @xmath129    the low - frequency expansion of the conductance is : @xmath130 in such a setting the inductive effects are much more difficult to see : one must go to order three in the conductance to observe them .",
    "we now apply an ac electric field along the sample and give therefore a spatial dependence to @xmath16 : @xmath131 the luttinger hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of the phase field @xmath132 conjugate to the density as ( we set @xmath133 ) : @xmath134 the equations of motion in the heisenberg representation for the density and the particle current are : @xmath135 where the particle current is ( as can be checked from the current conservation equation ) : @xmath136 these operators can therefore be written as : @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are arbitrary particular solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "one can choose @xmath140 to be proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "indeed using current conservation @xmath142 it follows immediately that : @xmath143 which implies that we can set : @xmath144    the chiral chemical potential operators are now:@xmath145 it is readily checked that the current operator is given by eq.([current - def ] ) : @xmath146 again it is convenient to shift the chemical potential operators to have operators which have a purely chiral time - evolution : @xmath147 we now consider the following boundary conditions : @xmath148 these boundary conditions correspond to source and drain voltages set to the ground ( zero voltage ) : therefore only the potential @xmath16 appears ; it corresponds to the energy gained due to the initial ( or final ) acceleration given by the applied electric field . in the previous section",
    "one did not have to take it into account since no electric field was applied .",
    "defining again the currents as entering the system :    @xmath149 the boundary conditions are rewritten as :    @xmath150 therefore : @xmath151    where the vector @xmath49 is defined as above ( eq.([mu ] ) ) . but according to eq.([current - def ] ) the current is rewritten as : @xmath152 therefore substitution of the previous equation in eq.([rho - mu ] ) yields : @xmath153 elimination of @xmath49 then yields : @xmath154    where the matrix @xmath155 is the same dynamical impedance matrix found above in eq.([impedance - matrix ] ) : @xmath156 @xmath157 is just the @xmath87 upper restriction of the dynamical conductance matrix @xmath158 found for the gated ll . equation ( [ main - result3 ] ) is the main result of this sub - section . it can be rewritten as :    @xmath159 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } ej_{0}(-a ) \\\\",

    "@xmath34 this matrix equation does not seem to appear in the literature : for instance ponomarenko writes the current at a given position in the inhomogeneous ll model for an arbitrary electric field as a green function convolution@xcite but that simple matrix relation between the response of a gated wire and the response to an arbitrary electric field is not explicitly written .",
    "joint measurements in both context would be interesting to reveal such relations between the dynamical responses .",

    "they find that : @xmath172 and therefore the current measured at the left electrode is : @xmath173 for _ a uniform electric field _ and _ plane electrodes orthogonal to the wire_.    that point of view is however valid only if one does not take into account relaxation processes in the reservoir : the charging of the reservoir must be taken into account only for frequencies @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the relaxation time of the reservoir , i.e. the inverse of the plasma frequency @xmath176 . for optical processes",
