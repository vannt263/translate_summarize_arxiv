    "protoplanetary disks are believed to be the birthplaces of planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; hence , understanding the evolution of these disks guides our understanding of the process of planet formation .",
    "disks which have substantial infrared excesses but reduced fluxes at wavelengths @xmath920 @xmath10 m , i.e. , transitional disks @xcite , could be related to the early phases of planet formation ( see a recent review of * ? ? ? * ) and are therefore particularly important for understanding how , where , and when planets form . for many transitional disks , partial inner holes or partial gaps",
    "have been directly resolved by interferometry at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and imaging at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the clearing of gaps in transitional disks , including grain growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photoevaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and gravitational interactions with orbiting planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two possible methods to distinguish the disk - planet interactions from other aforementioned proposed gap - clearing mechanisms could be the detection of ( 1 ) a planetary companion in the inner hole / gap region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or ( 2 ) a ring - like gap between optically thick inner and outer disks ( i.e. , pre - transitional disk ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because dynamical formation of wide gaps could be the only surviving mechanism for wide gapped disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    one good candidate to investigate the inner hole / gap region at tens au in the disk in pre - transitional disks is the weak - lined t tauri star pds  70 ( k5 type ; 0.82@xmath11 ; @xmath1210 myr ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a scattered light disk with a radius at 14 to 140 au was detected by @xmath13-band imaging @xcite .",
    "the possible presence of inner and outer disks with different temperatures were suggested by @xcite and @xcite , which may imply that pds  70 is a pre - transitional disk object . in this @xmath14 , we present high resolution imaging of pds  70 with subaru / hiciao and gemini / nici .",
    "observations of pds  70 were conducted with hiciao @xcite on the subaru telescope in polarized differential imaging ( pdi ) mode , combined with angular differential imaging ( adi ) mode @xcite , on 2012 february 28 ut .",
    "@xmath0-band linear polarization images were taken under the program seeds ( strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in pdi+adi , we employed a double wollaston prism to split incident light into four images , each has 5@xmath6 by 5@xmath6 field of view with a pixel scale of 9.5 mas / pixel , to make the saturated radius as small as possible .",
    "polarization was measured by rotating the half waveplate to four angular positions ( in the order of 0@xmath15 , 45@xmath15 , 22.5@xmath15 , and 67.5@xmath15 ) .",
    "we obtained 22 full waveplate rotation cycles , taking a 15-s exposure per waveplate position .",
    "the total integration time of the @xmath1 image was 660 s. even with a large airmass of @xmath72 during observations of pds  70 , the adaptive optics system ( ao188 ; * ? ? ? * ) provided a stellar psf of pds  70 with fwhm of 0.@xmath61 in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the angle of the total field rotation was @xmath713@xmath15 .",
    "the polarimetric data were reduced with the same procedure as for @xcite using iraf . since the strehl ratio of the stellar psf of pds  70 was @xmath70.26 , a stellar halo remained in the image , i.e , the psf convolved by seeing was not perfectly corrected by the ao and partially remains .",
    "this halo appears to be polarized along the minor axis of disks since the polarization of forward and back scattering is smaller due to the deviation from 90@xmath15 in the scattering angle , and then the stellar halo has a significant net - polarization . in other words , since the flux of a psf convolved by seeing contains contributions from both the central star and disk , the seeing - psf might be polarized along the minor axis of a disk . to correct for this @xmath16polarized halo@xmath17",
    ", we first derived the net - polarizarion of pds  70 with aperture polarimetry .",
    "we then made a model @xmath16polarized halo@xmath17 of pds  70 by multiplying the added image of @xmath18- and @xmath19-rays by the derived polarization of @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the errors were calculated with the photometric errors , and are thus a lower limit . finally , we subtracted the model @xmath16polarized halo@xmath17 and obtained final stokes @xmath22 and @xmath23 images .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] demonstrates the subtraction of the @xmath16polarized halo@xmath17 .",
    "we carried out adi observations of pds  70 in the @xmath3 band on 31 march 2012 , using the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) and the 85-element ao system @xcite mounted on the 8.1 m gemini south telescope at cerro pachon , chili .",
    "nici utilizes a 1024 @xmath24 1024 aladdin insb array with an plate scale of 18 mas / pix and field of view of 18 @xmath24 18 arcsec .",
    "we obtained 145 frames for pds  70 with 0.76-s @xmath24 25 coadd for @xmath3 band .",
    "although the sky was clear for the full night , the seeing was variable , therefore a subset of 95 frames were combined to produce the final image .",
    "the total exposure time was 1805 sec and the spatial resolution was achieved 0.@xmath611 .",
    "the angle of the total field rotation is @xmath7100@xmath15 .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the loci algorithm @xcite in annular regions of 1000 @xmath24 fwhm ( @xmath25 1000 ) with reference images selected from frames with at least 0.5 @xmath24 fwhm field rotation ( @xmath26 0.5 ) .",
    "a large optimization area diminishes the impact of the disk on the optimization process @xcite .",
    "the ratio of radial and azimuthal width of the optimization area ( @xmath27 ) is 1 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows @xmath0-band pi images and the @xmath3-band loci image of pds  70 assuming a distance of 140 pc , along with radial surface brightness profiles .",
    "we find a clear elliptical ring in the @xmath0-band , which has not been reported in previous high - resolution imaging @xcite .",
    "a partial elliptical disk is observed in the @xmath3-band , due to the inevitable loss of flux in the process of loci ; hence , we derive radial profiles of suface brightness based on the @xmath0-band pi image only and companion mass limits from the @xmath3-band loci image only .",
    "we consider that the ellipse shape is due to the system s inclination , and show the results of fitting an ellipse to these data in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the position angle of the major axis and the inclination of the disk are similar with those of @xmath28-band imaging ( pa @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we measured an offset of 44 @xmath31 3 mas ( @xmath76 au ) at pa=87.9@xmath15 between the geometric center of the disk and the central star .",
    "the positional accuracy of the central star is 1.5 mas ( 0.2 au ) .",
    "the direction of this offset is roughly consistent with that of the minor axis of 68.6@xmath15 , and the sign of this offset indicates that the southwest side is inclined toward us ( i.e. the near side ) ( see the model image in @xcite ) .",
    "this geometry is also consistent with the facts that ( 1 ) the northeast side of the disk is wider due to the back illumination of the wall @xcite , and ( 2 ) the southwest side is brighter than the northwest side due to forward scattering @xcite .",
    "assuming the cavity edges correspond to the peak pi of the disk , a radius of the cavity is measured as @xmath770 au . the outer radius of the disk is measured to be @xmath7140 au in figure  [ f2](d ) , and corresponds to the location at which our sensitivity is no longer sufficient to detect extended emission .",
    "we also found a flux deficit of @xmath1 in the direction of the minor axis .",
    "since the observed scattering angle at the minor axis deviates from 90@xmath15 , the polarization fraction along the minor axis is lower .",
    "the @xmath1 at the minor axis is therefore lower than at the major axis , and such hole - like structures are similar to those discussed in @xcite .",
    "we checked the proper motion of the companion cadidate to the north of pds  70 reported by @xcite .",
    "pds  70 has a proper motion of @xmath32 mas / yr @xcite ; the separation between pds  70 and the companion cadidate should increase if the companion cadidate is a background star . since the separation in hiciao and nici images are 324.13 @xmath31 0.15 au and 324.44 @xmath31 0.10 au , respectively , the separation in @xcite is inferred to be @xmath33 au .",
    "our estimation has a good agreement with the actual observed separation of 301.75 @xmath31 0.06 au in @xcite , and therefore , we concluded that the companion cadidate is a background star .      since the follow - up @xmath3-band observations with gemini / nici failed to detect any significant signals of point - like sources in the gap we put constraints of upper limits for companion(s ) .",
    "figure  [ f2](f ) shows the detectable masses of companions at 5@xmath34 .",
    "the loci parameter of the optimization area is 250 @xmath24 fwhm , which is different from that described in sec .",
    "[ loci ] . for that",
    ", we first applied a median filter with 0.@xmath611 width to the image , and then calculated the standard deviation as a noise level in concentric annuli along the major axis of the disk .",
    "the mass was calculated by assuming the cond evolutionary model @xcite , a distance of 140 pc , and an age of 10 myr @xcite .",
    "we took into account the flux loss due to the partial self - subtraction by testing how point sources are affected by loci .",
    "the detectable mass limit is tens @xmath8 , therefore , stellar companions down to masses associated with massive brown dwarfs are excluded within the gap .",
    "although the sed fitting for pds  70 has been performed in previous studies @xcite , both the availability of new archival photometric data ( table  [ table2 ] ) and our imaging results motivates us to revisit the sed of the system using monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) .",
    "note that though pds  70 has been observed by spitzer irs , the object was mispointed by @xmath72.3@xmath6 with components along both the spatial and dispersion axes , therefore , the irs spectrum of pds  70 is not used in this work .    * setup for modeling . * the method for our mcrt simulations is described in @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * in prep . ) . in a subsequent paper ii (",
    "* in prep . )",
    ", we will perform a detailed radiative transfer modeling of both the sed and the seeds imagery , and present a fiducial disk+cavity model which reproduces both observations well .",
    "we will also explore the parameter space around the fiducial model in paper ii , and provide a full discussion on the constraints on the various model parameters there . in this letter",
    ", we only briefly describe the fiducial model and its resulting sed .",
    "we note that this model is not a _",
    "best _ fitting model in an absolute sense , since a full @xmath35 fitting of the observations with all the free parameters in a protoplanetary disk is essentially impossible @xcite .",
    "however the constraints on many parameters such as the cavity size , depletion , and the surface density of the inner disk are reasonably tight , as will be shown in paper ii .",
    "our model contains a cavity 70 au in radius .",
    "the surface density both inside and outside the cavity decreases with radius as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 au , while @xmath38 inside the cavity is reduced to @xmath39 the extrapolated value from the outer disk , with @xmath40 being the depletion factor .",
    "the temperature structure of the disk is determined from the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the inner edge of the disk is self - consistently determined at the dust sublimation temperature ( @xmath41 k ) .",
    "we ignore accretion in the model , as suggested by its nature of being a weak line t tauri star @xcite .",
    "we use a pre - main sequence star of spectral type k5 , radius 1.39 @xmath42 , mass 0.82 @xmath43 , and temperature 4500  k for the central source , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disk has a gaussian density distribution in the vertical direction , with scale heights @xmath44 as input parameters .",
    "two disk components are included : a thick disk with small grains ( sub - micron - sized ) , representing the pristine ism - like dust ; and a thin disk with large grains ( up to @xmath7mm - sized ) and 20% of the scale height of the small grains , as the result of grain growth and settling @xcite .",
    "most of the dust mass ( 0.967 ) is in the settled disk , and the total dust - to - gas ratio is assumed to be 1/100 .",
    "the sed is produced assuming a disk inclination angle @xmath45 .",
    "the other parameters are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "* sed fitting . *",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the good agreement between our model sed and available photometric data . as we will show in paper ii , the thermal emission from the cavity wall at @xmath770 au peaks at @xmath46 m .",
    "the wall emission is a major signature of ( pre-)transitional disk sed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the surface density of small dust is @xmath47 g @xmath48 at 0.1 au , and the opacity of small dust is @xmath49@xmath50 g@xmath51 at @xmath52 m ( roughly the peak of the stellar radiation ) .",
    "this makes the inner disk optically thick in the vertical direction .",
    "since we assume a surface density profile decreasing with increasing radius , when moving out the cavity gradually becomes vertically optically thin , and the transition happens at @xmath53 au if only taking into account the small dust ( the existence of big dust inside the cavity is poorly determined from sed and scattered light image ) . as we will discuss in detail in paper ii , this optically thick inner disk is needed to explain the @xmath72 - 40 @xmath10 m sed , as models with optically thin inner disk fail to reproduce the sed .",
    "following the convention in the literature @xcite , we classify pds  70 as a pre - transitional disk object .",
    "grain growth is one mechanism which can potentially form disk gaps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is capable of reproducing the sed of transitional disks but not observed millimeter - wavelength images .",
    "however , the sharpness of pds  70 s @xmath0-band gap edge suggests grain growth is unlikely to be the primary reason , since the models generally predict smooth gap edge features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "photoevaporation is another possible mechanism .",
    "a photoevaporative wind can prevent outer disk material from feeding the inner disk ; without this supply , the inner disk material will rapidly accrete onto the central star , creating a cavity inside out @xcite .",
    "although a pre - transitional disk - like structure could be produced for a very short period ( see figure  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is quite unlikely to observe such a snap - shot by coincidence , so that it may be difficult to explain the existence of the optically thick inner disk inferred from the sed .",
    "dynamical interactions with ( sub)stellar companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or orbiting planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also potential mechanisms , as several binary systems ( e.g. , coku tau 4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are known to have a cavity in their circumbinary disk , and simulations show that multiple planets can open wide gaps @xcite , furthermore , the survival of an optically thick inner disk within a few au in @xcite mimics the inner disk of pds  70 .",
    "our @xmath3-band observation has only ruled out companions with a mass of @xmath5450@xmath8 in the gap region .",
    "therefore , dynamical interactions with low mass brown dawarfs or giant planets may be the origin of the gap .",
    "to put a futher constraint of an upper limit mass , future observations should be pursued , such as the aperture - masking interferometric observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a better contrast than loci imaging .",
    "since pds  70 harbors the pre - transitional disk with one of the largest gaps , this object may be one of the best candidate for future high - contrast planet imagers .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for providing many useful comments leading to an improved paper .",

    "<S> we present high resolution @xmath0-band polarized intensity ( @xmath1 ; fwhm = @xmath2 : 14 au ) and @xmath3-band imaging data ( fwhm @xmath4 : 15 au ) of the circumstellar disk around the weak - lined t tauri star pds  70 in centaurus at a radial distance of 28 au ( @xmath5 ) up to 210 au ( 1.@xmath65 ) . in both images , </S>",
    "<S> a giant inner gap is clearly resolved for the first time , and the radius of the gap is @xmath770 au . </S>",
    "<S> our data show that the geometric center of the disk shifts by @xmath76 au toward the minor axis . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the brown dwarf companion candidate to the north of pds  70 is a background star based on its proper motion . as a result of sed fitting by monte carlo radiative transfer modeling </S>",
    "<S> , we infer the existence of an optically thick inner disk at a few au . combining our observations and modeling , </S>",
    "<S> we classify the disk of pds  70 as a pre - transitional disk . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , based on the analysis of @xmath3-band imaging data , we put an upper limit mass of companions at @xmath730 to @xmath750@xmath8 within the gap . taking account of the presence of the large and sharp gap </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the gap could be formed by dynamical interactions of sub - stellar companions or multiple unseen giant planets in the gap . </S>"
