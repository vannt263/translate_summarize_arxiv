    "for a rapidly rotating magnetized star , the centrifugal force at the magnetospheric radius may be larger than the gravitational force . in this case the magnetosphere acts as a  propeller \" pushing away incoming matter ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ; illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; lipunov 1992 ) . the propeller regime has been discussed in connection with different astrophysical situations ( e.g. , stella , white , & rosner 1986 ; treves , colpi & lipunov 1993 ; cui 1997 ; alpar 2001 ; eksi & alpar 2003 ; mori & ruderman 2003 ) .",
    "a detailed understanding of the propeller regime is important for the analysis of a number of astrophysical systems , including classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) , cataclysmic variables , x - ray pulsars , isolated neutron stars , and possibly anomalous x - ray pulsars .    for quasi - spherical accretion ,",
    "the propeller regime was investigated analytically by davies , fabian , and pringle ( 1979 ) , davies and pringle ( 1981 ) , and ikhsanov ( 2002 ) , and numerically by romanova et al .",
    "( 2003a ) for the case of an aligned magnetic rotator .",
    "the numerical simulations have shown that the propelling star expels significant magnetic flux in the radial direction , thus forming the low - density , azimuthally wrapped equatorial magnetic wind .",
    "at the same time , some matter was observed to accrete along the magnetic poles of the star ( as observed in the non - rotating case , toropina et al .",
    "these simulations revealed a complicated flow geometry not considered in the theoretical models .",
    "disk accretion to a star in the propeller regime was investigated theoretically by li and wickramasinghe ( 1997 ) , lovelace , romanova , and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1999 ) .",
    "wang and robertson ( 1985 ) analyzed numerically the disk - star interaction in the propeller regime , but only in the equatorial plane .",
    "romanova et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter rukl ) did axisymmetric simulations of disk accretion to the fast rotating star , however only in the regime of very soft propeller . in this paper",
    "we discuss for the first time axisymmetric mhd simulations of disk accretion to fast propellers .",
    "axisymmetric mhd simulations have been done for the interaction of an accretion disk with a rapidly rotating magnetized star in the propeller regime .",
    "the arrangement of the model is similar to that used in rukl for analysis of disk accretion to slowly rotating magnetized stars .",
    "that is , ( 1 ) a spherical grid ( r,@xmath2,@xmath3 ) was used which assures the high spatial resolution near the star ; the grid @xmath4 was used in most of simulations ; ( 2 ) a godunov - type numerical method was used ; the code was improved compared to rukl so that now we were able to deal with extremely fast rotating magnetized stars ( see details in ustyugova et al . 2004 ) ; ( 3 )  quiescent \" initial conditions were used so that we were able to investigate the slow viscous accretion of disk matter to the star .",
    "we use the same scaling parameters as in rukl .",
    "the length - scale @xmath5 is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the radius of the star .",
    "the velocity scale is @xmath8 , and the time - scale is @xmath9 .",
    "the unit of time in our plots is the rotational period at @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "the other scaling parameters are those for the magnetic field , @xmath12 , the density , @xmath13 , and the pressure , @xmath14 .",
    "the corotation radius , @xmath15 , is the distance at which the angular velocity of the star @xmath16 equals the keplerian angular velocity of the disk , @xmath17 . in dimensionless form , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we use the dimensionless angular velocity normalized to the keplerian velocity at the surface of the star : @xmath21 .",
    "subsequently , we use only dimensionless variables @xmath22 , etc . but drop tildes .",
    "results obtained in dimensionless form are general and can be applied to objects with widely different scales .",
    "the initial conditions are similar to rukl .",
    "namely , there is a cold dense disk with inner radius @xmath23 and a hot rarefied corona elsewhere .",
    "the region @xmath24 rotates with the angular velocity of the star , while in the region @xmath25 both the disk and the corona rotate with the angular velocity @xmath26 so as to avoid an initial discontinuity of the magnetic field at the boundary between the disk and corona .",
    "the density and temperature distribution in the disk and corona are derived from the balance of the gravitational , centrifugal , and pressure gradient forces . the disk and corona are in pressure balance .",
    "the initial density distribution of the disk is different from a stationary , non - magnetized shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) disk in the respect that the initial surface density increases gradually with distance in the outer part of the disk well outside of the alfvn radius .",
    "an @xmath27type viscosity was incorporated in our code so as to give a controllable inflow of matter from the outer disk .",
    "we tried different @xmath28 values in the range @xmath29 and used @xmath30 as the base one for most of simulations . as a result of the viscosity",
    "the outer disk evolves slowly towards a stationary shakura - sunyaev disk , but there is insufficient time for the equilibrium to be reached .",
    "the conditions at the outer boundary ( located at @xmath31 ) allow the inflow of additional matter to the computational region . however , matter inflow across @xmath32 was not significant for the simulation times discussed here .    compared with rukl , we gradually increased the rotation rate of the star from a small value @xmath33 up to the final value @xmath34 during several rotations of the star .",
    "the inner radius of the disk was placed at the corotation radius corresponding to the initial spin , @xmath35 , that is , far away from the star .",
    "these modifications of initial conditions helped to overcome numerical difficulties in this extreme case of a rapidly rotating star .",
    "these initial conditions were tested and checked in multiple runs with different initial @xmath23 , different times of rotational acceleration , variations of the matter distribution in the disk and corona , and sizes of the simulation region .",
    "we performed multiple simulation runs for different angular velocities of the star @xmath0 with the other parameters fixed .",
    "the investigated range was from @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ( weak propeller ) to @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "below we discuss a case where @xmath34 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we observed , that initially the disk moved outward so that the inner radius of the disk increased from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "then it stabilized around this value .",
    "we observed that the structure of magnetosphere around the star was different from the magnetospheres of slowly rotating stars .",
    "namely , the magnetosphere expanded in both radial and vertical directions .",
    "magnetic field lines from the poles of the star expanded vertically and open , forming  magnetic towers \" ( figure 1 , top ) .",
    "only a fraction of the total magnetic flux ( @xmath43 ) goes into the magnetic tower .",
    "the remainder of the flux forms a _ closed _ magnetosphere , which does not expand vertically , but instead expands in radial direction .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "the magnetic field is strongly twisted in this magnetosphere so that the toroidal component is much larger than the other components .",
    "this is shown in the left - hand panel of figure 2 .",
    "the field varies as @xmath44 in the equatorial region .",
    "note that similar gradual distribution of the field was found in case of spherical accretion to the propelling star ( romanova et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "the magnetosphere expands due to the rapid rotation of the star .",
    "the accreting matter stops at the alfvn radius @xmath45 , where the matter pressure equals the magnetic pressure , @xmath46 .",
    "because the @xmath47field becomes non - dipolar , we can not use the standard formulae for @xmath45 , but instead must to find @xmath45 numerically .",
    "we found that the alfvn radius @xmath48 which is much larger than that for a non - rotating star ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we performed simulations at a wide variety of @xmath0 and found that the alfvn radius increases with @xmath0 as @xmath50 .",
    "the magnetosphere rotates with a super - keplerian velocity , but not rigidly as shown in the right - hand panel of figure 2 .",
    "the angular velocity gradually decreases from a maximum value near the star to a keplerian velocity of the disk at the magnetospheric radius @xmath45 .",
    "thus , there is no sharp transition in angular velocity between the magnetosphere and the disk and  classical \" propeller effect of pushing away incoming matter by the rigidly rotating magnetosphere is not observed .",
    "instead , the disk  stands off \" near @xmath45 and tends to be `` lifted '' out of the equatorial plane .",
    "this leads to the formation of elongated funnel stream ( see figure 3 , left panel ) .",
    "this stream first encounters the barrier formed by the rotating magnetic tower .",
    "however , the stream gradually forces the magnetic field lines of the tower to reconnect and thus creates the path for accretion to the surface of the star ( middle panel ) . after the accretion event , the magnetic field of the tower expands , forming an obstacle to further accretion ( right panel ) .",
    "then matter accumulates again and a new cycle of the accretion begins ( see animation in : @xmath51 ) .",
    "this phenomenon of quasi - periodic outbursts associated with reconnection of the magnetic field lines was predicted by aly & kuijpers ( 1990 ) and was observed in numerical simulations of accretion to slowly rotating stars ( see goodson et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; rukl ; van rekowsky & brandenburg 2004 ; kato , hayashi & matsumoto 2004 ) .",
    "accretion is possible because in the magnetosphere of the propelling star the angular velocity decreases with the distance . at the distance @xmath52 , the centrifugal force is about equal to the gravitational force",
    "this is why matter accretes through the funnel streams as in cases of slowly rotating stars . in case of propeller",
    "the variability is much stronger because the magnetic tower temporarily blocks the accretion .",
    "the quasi - period observed in the case of the propeller with @xmath34 is about @xmath53 is large compared to cases of propellers with smaller angular velocity , @xmath54 ( rukl ) .",
    "we estimated the accretion rate through the disk at the distance @xmath55 which is beyond the alfvn radius .",
    "we observed that the inner regions of the disk oscillate in the radial direction with a quasi - period @xmath56 which is shorter than the main quasi - period of accretion to the star .",
    "the average accretion rate is @xmath57 .",
    "angular momentum is transported between the star and the disk by the magnetic field of the closed magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic tower influences to the dynamics of gas flow around the propelling star , but it is not important for the angular momentum transport .    figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of the matter flux to the star @xmath58 , and the torques due to the matter flow @xmath59 , and due to the magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "the total torque is mainly due to the magnetic field .",
    "the torque due to the accreting matter is negligibly small even in periods of enhanced accretion , like in cases of slowly rotating stars ( rukl ) .",
    "we note that the star spins down _ continuously _",
    ", even during periods when the accretion is blocked by the magnetic tower . when the accretion rate increases , the _ spin - down torque also increases_. this is in opposite to the standard spin - down theory , where the spin - down torque decreases with accretion rate .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that during periods of enhanced accretion , a larger fraction of the star s flux is in the closed magnetosphere .",
    "this leads to a larger spin - down torque . running a number of cases with different @xmath0",
    ", we obtained the dependence for the average torque in the form @xmath61 .",
    "note , that the same dependence was found in simulations of quasi - spherical accretion to the propelling star , which were done with different numerical code ( romanova et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "the early ideas that accreting stars may spin - down due to the magnetic disk - star interaction were developed by ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) and included the prediction that a star may accrete and spin - down at the same time .",
    "this last conclusion was observed in rukl for the case of a weak propeller .",
    "the effect is observed in the present simulations of much more rapidly rotating stars .",
    "the spin - down rate is observed to _ increase _ with accretion rate .",
    "this dependence is new and different from that for slowly rotating stars .",
    "we observed that disk accretion to a star in the propeller regime exhibits a number of interesting new features : ( 1 ) the most remarkable one is the fact that the _ rate of spin - down increases as the accretion rate increases .",
    "_ this is opposite the dependence in the non - propeller regime ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the fact that accretion _ occurs _ in the strong propeller regime is also important .",
    "the accretion is _ quasi - periodic _ and occurs through elongated funnel streams which go around the region of centrifugally - dominated magnetosphere .",
    "( 3 ) about 1/3 of the star s magnetic flux goes to the magnetic tower which represents a region of opened field lines .",
    "however , the remainder of the flux goes into a radially expanded closed magnetosphere , which connects the star and the disk .",
    "this magnetic field is responsible for the strong angular momentum transport between the star and the disk .",
    "( 4 ) the propeller stage may be very efficient in spinning - down rapidly rotating accreting stars .",
    "it was recently suggested that the opening of the magnetic field lines disconnects the star and the disk ( e.g. , lovelace et al .",
    "1995 ) so that the spin - down of the star should be significantly reduced ( agapitou & papaloizou 2000 ; matt & pudritz 2004 ) .",
    "our simulations show that most of the magnetic flux of the star is in a closed magnetosphere and is coupled to the accretion disk .",
    "the angular momentum of the star is magnetically transported to the disk .",
    "thus , the propeller mechanism may explain the spinning - down of the classical t tauri stars .",
    "for much stronger magnetic fields , propeller - driven outflows were observed , which will be discussed in a subsequent paper ( ustyugova et al .",
    "recently , we were able to perform full 3d simulations of the disk accretion to an inclined dipole ( koldoba et al .",
    "2002 , romanova et al . 2003b , 2004 )",
    "next , we plan to investigate the propeller regime using fully three - dimensional mhd simulations .",
