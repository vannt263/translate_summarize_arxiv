    "water exhibits a wide variety of solid phases , which are referred to as forms of ` ice ' .",
    "most of these phases are produced by the application of high pressures , which yields a denser packing of water molecules than in the usual hexagonal ice ih .",
    "thus , sixteen different crystalline ice phases have been identified so far @xcite , and their stability range in the temperature - pressure phase diagram has been investigated for several decades .",
    "some of their properties lack , however , a complete understanding , mainly due to their peculiar structure , where hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules give rise to the so - called ` water anomalies ' @xcite .    in the known ice phases except ice x",
    ", water keeps its molecular character , building up a network connected by h - bonds . in this network each water molecule is surrounded by four others , in such a way that its orientation with respect to the neighboring ones fulfills the so - called bernal - fowler ice rules @xcite .",
    "these rules allow for the presence of orientational disorder in the water molecules , which causes that in several ice phases hydrogen atoms present a disordered spatial distribution , as indicated by a fractional occupancy of their lattice sites .",
    "thus , hexagonal ice ih , the stable phase of solid water under normal conditions , displays hydrogen disorder compatible with the ice rules , whereas other phases such as ice ii are h - ordered @xcite .",
    "given the number of ice structures , a unifying classification can help to deeper understanding of their specific properties @xcite . for crystalline solids , classification schemes usually rest on the space symmetry , short - range atomic environments , or geometrical aspects of packing of structural units .",
    "these classification procedures have a geometrical nature , as their main criteria are geometrical characteristics of crystal structures @xcite .",
    "these geometrical classification methods , however , can be hardly applicable to find relations between solids whose structures are somewhat distorted .",
    "a possible alternative consists in using classification schemes relying on topological criteria .",
    "this means centering attention mainly on the organization of interatomic bonds in a crystal structure as a basic criterion for a crystal - chemical analysis . in this line ,",
    "topological properties of crystalline solids have been taken into account along the years to describe properties of different types of materials @xcite .",
    "for the ice polymorphs , a discussion of different network topologies and the relation of ring sizes in the various phases with the crystal volume was presented by salzmann _",
    "topological studies of three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrogen - bonded frameworks in organic crystals have also helped to classify this kind of structures @xcite . moreover , graph theory has been used to study isotypism and order / disorder problems in crystal structures @xcite .",
    "a direct and rather simple topological classification of ice structures can be based on structural rings , i.e. , loops of water molecules characteristic of each polymorph @xcite .",
    "a more elaborate procedure can be based on the so - called ` coordination sequence ' , defined as a series of numbers @xmath5 ( @xmath6 = 1 , 2 , ... ) , where @xmath7 is the number of sites located at a topological distance @xmath6 from a reference site @xcite .",
    "the coordination sequence can be used to define a topological density , as a structural characteristic related to the increase in the number @xmath7 of sites accessible through @xmath6 links in a given structure @xcite .",
    "note that these concepts are based only on the topology of the considered network , and are not affected by lattice distortions or other structural factors .",
    "these concepts have been recently applied to ice polymorphs , allowing us to find a correlation between topological density and volume @xcite .    in this paper , a different way to characterize the ice polymorphs is introduced .",
    "namely , it is based on self - avoiding walks in the corresponding structures . a self - avoiding walk ( saw )",
    "is a sequence of moves on a network that does not visit any node more than once .",
    "contrary to unrestricted walks , saws contain implicit information on the topology of the considered network , as they are sensitive to characteristics such as the number and size of loops present in the structure .",
    "a particularly interesting parameter is the so - called connective constant or effective coordination number of the ice networks , which can be calculated from the long - distance behavior of the number of possible saws in the corresponding structures .",
    "these concepts are explained in detail in the following section .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "on one side , knowledge of the connective constants of ice structures is interesting from a basic point of view for their comparison with other crystal structures , for which this kind of statistical - mechanics questions have been analyzed in detail . on the other side",
    ", they are relevant for a topological and physico - chemical characterization of ice phases , allowing us to connect structural and thermodynamic properties of this type of solids .",
    "in particular , the configurational entropy associated to the hydrogen distribution on the available lattice sites is known to depend on the ice structure @xcite , so that a search for structural variables suitable to quantify in some way such a dependence is worthwhile in the context of ice thermodynamics .",
    "in order to study saws for the different ice polymorphs , we consider each structure as defined by the positions of the oxygen atoms .",
    "one has thus a network , where the nodes are o sites , and the links are h - bonds between nearest neighbors .",
    "the network coordination is four ( @xmath8 ) , which gives a total of @xmath9 links , @xmath10 being the number of nodes .",
    "we implicitly assume that on each link there is one h atom , but its consideration is not relevant for our present purposes .",
    "a self - avoiding walk on an ice network is defined as a walk in the simplified structure which can never intersect itself . on a given network ,",
    "the walk is restricted to move to a nearest neighbor site during each step , and the self - avoiding condition constrains the walk to occupy only sites which have not been previously visited in the same walk @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the application of this definition to ice ih in fig .  1 , where an eight - step saw is shown .",
    "note that the link indicated with a cross is not available for step @xmath4 = 8 , as the walk would reach a node already visited in an earlier step .",
    "saws have been used in condensed - matter science for several purposes .",
    "for instance , they were employed for modeling the large - scale properties of long - flexible macromolecules in solution and adsorbed on surfaces @xcite , as well as for the study of polymers trapped in confined regions , gel electrophoresis , and size exclusion chromatography , which deal with the transport of polymers through membranes with very small pores @xcite .",
    "they have been also employed in the analysis of critical phenomena in lattice models @xcite , and to study complex networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , saws with multiple site weightings and restrictions have been discussed in the literature @xcite .    given a network and a site @xmath11 in it ,",
    "we will call @xmath12 the number of different saws of length @xmath4 starting from this site . for networks where all sites are topologically equivalent ,",
    "the sequence @xmath13 will coincide for all nodes , but in general , sequences corresponding to different nodes in a network may be different .",
    "( note that for all sequences mentioned in the following @xmath4 is understood to run from 1 to @xmath14 , although not explicitly indicated . )",
    "it is important to recall that crystallographically equivalent sites are always topologically equivalent , but sites non - equivalent crystallographically may be topologically equivalent or not @xcite .",
    "then , we define an average sequence @xmath15 for each network , where for a given @xmath4 , @xmath0 is obtained by averaging the @xmath12 values for the oxygen sites in the unit cell : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the multiplicity of site @xmath11 in the unit cell and @xmath18 . for ice structures including oxygen sites topologically",
    "non - equivalent ( e.g. , ices iii , iv , v , vi , and xii ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , relative differences between @xmath12 values corresponding to different sites in a given structure decrease fast with the walk length @xmath4 . in fact",
    ", the relative difference is about 1% for @xmath4 = 25 , and becomes negligible in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "it is remarkable that universal constants are known to describe some properties of self - avoiding walks .",
    "these constants depend on the network dimension , and have been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "other parameters controlling the long - distance behavior of saws are network - dependent , and can be used to characterize different networks with the same dimension .",
    "analytical expressions describing the asymptotic behavior of saws for large @xmath4 are significantly different from those of unrestricted walks .",
    "it is particularly interesting the dependence of @xmath0 on the number of steps @xmath4 for long walks .",
    "its asymptotic behavior for large @xmath4 is known to be given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a critical exponent which takes a value @xmath21 for 3d structures @xcite , and @xmath2 is the so - called ` connective constant ' or effective coordination number of the corresponding structure @xcite .    defining the ratio @xmath22 one",
    "has @xmath23 so that the ( non - universal ) parameter @xmath2 can be obtained as the large-@xmath4 limit of the sequence @xmath24 .",
    "the connective constant depends upon the particular topology of each structure , and has been determined very accurately for standard 3d lattices . in particular , for the diamond structure ( with the same topology as cubic ice ic ) , one has @xmath2 = 2.8790 @xcite .",
    "in general , for structures with coordination number @xmath25 , one has @xmath26 @xcite .    for some ice networks ,",
    "the convergence of @xmath27 to the connective constant @xmath2 is rather smooth , but in other cases an odd - even alternation is present . for this reason , it is convenient to average out this effect partially by evaluating the average values @xmath28 and then studying the convergence of the sequence @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "this is the procedure that will be employed here .",
    "we have verified that the connective constant @xmath2 so obtained from the average sequence @xmath15 coincides within error bars with that yielded by averaging the values derived independently from the sequences @xmath31 of different network nodes .",
    "this procedure gives a good estimate of the connective constant , but other , more elaborate , numerical methods such as differential approximants are known to yield more accurate estimates for the extrapolated values of @xmath2 from the sequence @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such a high precision , required for some studies in statistical physics , is not necessary for our present purposes .",
    "in fact , the estimated error bar of the @xmath2 values derived from our extrapolation of the sequence @xmath29 is @xmath32 .",
    "a check of this extrapolation method is provided by the ice ic network , that is equivalent in our context to the diamond structure .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 derived here for ice ic is consistent with the value found for diamond in earlier estimations @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath15 for a given ice structure depends only on the topology of the network , and not on the actual symmetry , cell parameters , or other structural data .",
    "in particular , it is not affected by the ordering of h atoms , and structures such as those of ices ih and xi ( the former being h - disordered and the latter h - ordered ) , with the same topology , will have the same sequence @xmath33 .",
    "at present , there are five other known pairs of ice structures sharing the same topology , and related one to the other through an order / disorder phase transition . then , one has six pairs of ice polymorphs : ih - xi , iii - ix , v - xiii , vi - xv , vii - viii , and xii - xiv @xcite , where the first polymorph in each pair is h - disordered and the second is h - ordered . for our present purposes",
    ", we will only refer in the following to the disordered case , but understanding that it represents both members of the corresponding pair of ice polymorphs .",
    "in addition to these , there exist other ice structures for which no pair has been found : ice ic ( h - disordered ) , ice ii ( h - ordered ) , and ice iv ( h - disordered ) .",
    "finally , ice x is topologically equivalent to ices vii and viii , but with the important difference that in ice x hydrogen atoms lie midway between oxygen atoms , so that water molecules lose in fact their own entity ( this is however unimportant for our present considerations ) .",
    "thus , one has 9 topologically different ice structures .",
    "we note that the network associated to ice vii ( as well as ices viii and x ) is composed of two interpenetrating but disjoint subnetworks , each of them equivalent to the ice ic network .",
    "there is another case , the pair vi - xv , for which the network also consists of two disjoint subnetworks , but they are not equivalent to the network of any other known ice polymorph .    cccc + phase & crystal system & space group & ref .",

    "in general , a study of the asymptotic behavior of the sequence @xmath15 for a given network requires the generation of large supercells . for the ice structures considered in this work ,",

    "a first characteristic observable in the ice networks is the presence of loops ( rings of water molecules ) , which define the particular topology of each structure .",

    "the number of saws is given by @xmath60 where @xmath25 is the number of nearest neighbors ( degree or connectivity in the language of graph theory ) , assumed to be the same for all sites .",

    "for example , for our networks with @xmath8 the maximum number @xmath54 of 5-step saws is that corresponding to the bethe lattice : @xmath63 = 324 .",
    "then , the lower values of @xmath54 for some ice networks ( see table  ii ) are due to the presence of rings including five or less nodes .",
    "this happens for ices v and vi which contain four - membered rings ( @xmath64 ) and ice iii with @xmath65 . for longer saws ( larger @xmath4 ) ,",
    "loops with higher number of nodes also contribute to reduce the number @xmath0 with respect to that of the bethe lattice .",

    "although results for those non - equivalent sites can be clearly different for small @xmath4 values , for larger @xmath4 they converge for each ice polymorph to the same limit .",
    "this should be expected , as for large length @xmath4 , the walk looses memory of the starting node .",
    "the resulting values for the connective constant @xmath2 of the considered structures are given in table  ii .",

    ", the connective constant @xmath2 is a purely topological concept , and therefore should in some way be related with other ( more basic ) topological aspects of the ice structures .",
    "the first quantity to be compared with @xmath2 will be the mean loop size @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "4 we present the connective constant of various ice polymorphs vs @xmath58 . for the sake of comparison , we include a data point for the 2d square lattice , where all loops have @xmath70 .",
    "one first observes in this plot a tendency of the connective constant @xmath2 to increase for rising @xmath58",
    ". there appears , however , an appreciable dispersion of the data points for different ice polymorphs , indicating a low correlation between both quantities . a more careful observation of the data shown in fig .",
    "4 reveals that the points corresponding to the ice structures are roughly aligned , with the exception of ices v and vi that appreciably depart from the general trend .",
    "common to these two ice polymorphs is that they are the only ones including four - membered rings ( @xmath64 ) .",

    "4 is a linear fit to the data points of ice structures not including four - membered rings . for these structures we have @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath65 for ice iii , @xmath72 for ices ih , ic , ii , and iv , and @xmath73 for ice xii .",
    "we observe in fact that the point corresponding to ice iii lies below the dashed line , whereas that corresponding to ice xii appears above it .",
    "this is in line with the trend found for ices v and vi , since @xmath74 .    from these results",
    "we conclude that the connective constant tends to increase as the ring mean size increases , but the presence of four - membered rings strongly affects the actual value of @xmath2 .",

    ", the actual coordination sequences corresponding to different sites may be different , but the coefficient @xmath57 coincides for all sites in a given structure @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 can be used to define a ` topological density ' for ice polymorphs , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number of disconnected subnetworks in the considered network @xcite .",
    "usually @xmath78 , but for ice structures including two interpenetrating networks ( as ices vi and vii ) one has @xmath79 .    in fig .  5 we display the connective constant @xmath2 of ice polymorphs vs the coefficient @xmath57 derived from the coordination sequences",
    "as in fig .  4",
    ", we also include a point for the 2d square lattice .",
    "we find again that @xmath2 increases for increasing parameter @xmath57 , but there appears a dispersion in the data points , which can be associated to the minimum ring size of the considered ice structures .",
    "in particular , ice polymorphs including four - membered rings ( @xmath64 ) depart appreciably from the general trend of the other structures , similarly to the correlation between @xmath2 and the mean loop size @xmath58 shown in fig .",

    "on one side , the dashed - dotted line is a linear fit for the structures with @xmath64 , including the 2d square lattice . on the other side ,",
    "the dashed line is a least - square fit for the ice polymorphs with @xmath80 , where all of them have @xmath72 except ice xii , for which @xmath73 ( see table  ii ) . for the remaining ice polymorph ( ice iii ) , with @xmath65 , the corresponding point ( full square ) lies on the region between both lines in fig .",
    "one of the goals of the present work consists in finding relations between topological characteristics and thermodynamic properties of ice polymorphs . in this line",
    ", it has recently been shown that the network topology plays a role to quantitatively describe the configurational entropy associated to hydrogen disorder in ice structures @xcite .",
    "this has been in fact known after the work by nagle @xcite , who calculated the entropy for ices ih and ic .",
    "this author showed that the actual structure is relevant for this purpose , by comparing his results with pauling s value for the configurational entropy , derived in a simple approximation for a loop - free network ( bethe lattice ) .",
    "it has been recently shown that a simple procedure based on thermodynamic integration yields reliable results for the configurational entropy , @xmath81 , of other ice structures with hydrogen disorder @xcite .",
    "this method was applied to ice vi , for which an entropy per site @xmath81 = 0.4214(1 ) was found , vs @xmath81 = 0.4107(1 ) for ice ih and pauling s value @xmath81 = 0.4055 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath81 is dimensionless and can be converted to the physical configurational entropy @xmath82 as @xmath83 , with @xmath10 the number of water molecules ( nodes in the simplified network ) and @xmath84 boltzmann s constant .",
    "it thus appears that the topology of the network has a non - negligible influence on the entropy of the hydrogen distribution over the available lattice sites .    in fig .",
    "6 we present the configurational entropy per site vs the connective constant @xmath2 for ices ih and vi , as well as for the bethe lattice ( pauling result ) and the 2d square lattice .",
    "the entropy value for the ice model on the square lattice has been taken from an exact calculation by lieb @xcite : @xmath81 = 0.4315 .",
    "one observes in this figure a negative correlation between the entropy @xmath81 and @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed line is a least - square fit to the data points .",
    "we do not see any reason why this correlation should be linear , but it seems clear that there is a relation between both magnitudes .",
    "a qualitative argument for this relation is the following .",
    "the connective constant is a measure of the mean effective number of sites connected to a node in a long self - avoiding walk . for the distribution of hydrogen atoms on the links of the ice networks according to the bernal - fowler rules , a larger @xmath2 means an increase in the correlations in the occupancy of the available hydrogen sites , as information on the actual occupancy of a link propagates ` more effectively ' through the ice network",
    "such an increase in the site - occupancy correlations causes a reduction in the number of available configurations compatible with the ice rules on a given structure , which translates into a decrease in the configurational entropy of the hydrogen distribution on the considered ice network . in this line , relations between saws and order / disorder problems , such as the ising model on lattices ,",
    "have been found and studied in the past @xcite .",
    "looking at fig .  6 in more detail , one expects also that dimensionality can play a role in the actual values of the configurational entropy , and thus values derived for the 2d square lattice and the bethe lattice ( without a well defined dimension @xmath85 ; for some purposes @xmath86 ) may depart from the general trend found for 3d structures .",
    "this question should be investigated in the future , as configurational entropy associated to hydrogen disorder can be precisely calculated for other crystalline ice structures using methods as those described in refs .",
    "we have presented a calculation of self - avoiding walks on eight crystalline ice structures , which include all topologically different ice networks known so far .",
    "saws have been enumerated up to a walk length @xmath1 , which allowed us to obtain the connective constants for the different polymorphs .",
    "this parameter @xmath2 has turned out to be a quantitative topological characteristic of ice structures .",
    "correlations between the connective constant and other topological aspects of ice polymorphs have been found .",
    "the constant @xmath2 is in fact related with the mean ring size @xmath58 , although the correlation between both quantities is largely influenced by the minimum ring size @xmath59 in each structure .",
    "a similar correlation between the connective constant and the parameter @xmath57 controlling the coordination sequences in these crystalline structures ( @xmath87 ) has been found .",

    "a generalization to other crystalline ice polymorphs would be interesting , to check the extent to which this correlation is followed for this kind of structures .",
