    "a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in a high magnetic field and low temperature exhibits a rich structure of phases as a function of the filling factor @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the electron density and @xmath4 is the magnetic field ) . the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite",
    "is characterized by quantized plateaus in the hall resistance , where @xmath5 , and a vanishing longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath6  around @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon occurs because the 2des at integer filling factors @xmath8 is an incompressible liquid with a finite excitation gap .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite refers to plateaus at @xmath9 in the vicinity of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a fraction .",
    "our understanding of the physics of the lowest landau level ( lll ) has evolved greatly in the last two decades . the fqhe has been explained by the composite fermion ( cf ) theory @xcite as the iqhe of quasiparticles called cf s , which are electrons bound to an even number ( @xmath12 ) of quantized vortices of the many - body wave function .",
    "cf s feel a reduced magnetic field @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "composite fermions form landau - like levels in the reduced magnetic field , which we will call @xmath0-levels  ( @xmath0l s ) .",
    "@xmath0-levels are analogous to landau levels ( ll s ) of electrons at @xmath15 .",
    "( the @xmath0-levels have been called cf - quasi - landau levels in the literature . to avoid confusion with the landau levels of electrons ,",
    "we prefer to use @xmath0-levels .",
    " landau level \" will refer below exclusively to _ electronic _ landau levels .",
    "composite fermions can fill many @xmath0-levels within one landau level . ) when cf s fill an integral number @xmath16 of @xmath0-levels , an incompressible quantum liquid with a finite excitation gap results , producing an iqhe of cf s .",
    "such conditions are achieved at electron fillings @xmath17 , which are precisely the prominently observed fractions .",
    "further , the microscopic wave functions based on this physics provide an excellent account of the actual eigenfunctions .",
    "cf theory with neglected inter - cf interaction thus successfully explains most of the observed fractions in the lll .",
    "this paper is concerned with fractional quantum hall effect in the @xmath18  ll .",
    "given that more than 50 fractions have been observed in the lowest ll , one might expect a large number of fractions in the second ll as well , but fqhe is relatively scarce in the second or higher ll s .",
    "however , with improved experimental conditions ( higher mobilities and lower temperatures ) , many fractions have been observed outside of the lll . as seen in the experiments of xia",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the observed fractions are @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the filling factor of the second ll .",
    "( the total filling factor is @xmath22 or @xmath23 , with each ll contributing two to the filling factor , taking the spin degree of freedom into account . )",
    "gervais _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also seen evidence for fqhe at @xmath24 and @xmath20 in the _ third _ ll . indeed , the decreasing stability of cf formation has been suggested on theoretical grounds @xcite , and charge - density wave phases are known to be dominant in @xmath25 ll s  @xcite .",
    "the competition between many nearly degenerate ground states is illustrated by the observation of the so - called re - entrant integral quantum hall effect : the system goes back and forth between the iqhe and the fqhe state several times ( see , for example eisenstein _",
    "_ @xcite and xia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , with the re - entrant iqhe interpreted in terms of a localization of a correlated bubble crystal proposed theoretically by koulakov , fogler , and shklovskii  @xcite .",
    "because the observed fractions are consistent with the expectation from a trivial generalization of the cf theory to the second ll , it is natural to attempt an explanation in terms of composite fermions .",
    "however , the microscopic description of the observed fractions in the @xmath18  ll has not been as successful as in the lowest ll .",
    "as noted by haldane @xcite and by dambrumenil and reynolds @xcite , a generalization of the laughlin wave function for the ground state at @xmath26 to the @xmath18  ll @xcite has rather poor overlaps with the exact second ll ground state ( from 0.47 to 0.61 for @xmath27 particles ) , which is to be contrasted with near unity overlaps in the lowest ll .",
    "in fact , exact diagonalization studies @xcite on small systems have been unable to capture conclusively the incompressibility of @xmath28 , because the system is compressible for some particle numbers and incompressible for others , and for the incompressible states , the gap varies widely with the number of particles @xcite .",
    "the observation of many fqhe states in the filling factor range @xmath29 has motivated us to seek a better quantitative understanding of the fqhe in the second ll .",
    "another motivation arises , interestingly , from certain new fqhe states within the lowest landau level .",
    "et al._@xcite have observed several fractions ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) that fall outside the primary jain sequences @xmath17 .",
    "although these sequences exhaust the possible fractions for a system of _ non_interacting composite fermions , the residual interaction between the cf s can generate more fractions , in perfect analogy to the appearance of the fqhe for electrons because of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the new fractions are interpreted in terms of the _ higher _ @xmath0-level _ fractional _ qhe of composite fermions  @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath36 is related to the fqhe at @xmath37 of cf s , i.e. , @xmath1 of cf s in the second cf @xmath0l .",
    "( in sufficiently high magnetic fields the system is fully polarized , and electrons or composite fermions can be taken to be effectively  spinless . \"",
    "this is equivalent to the limit in which the zeeman energy is much larger than the cyclotron energy .",
    "the filling factor @xmath21 in the second ll corresponds to @xmath38 for spinless electrons , but to @xmath22 for the real  spinful \" electrons of experiment . )",
    "it was shown by chang and jain  @xcite that the actual 4/11 state is extremely well described quantitatively by analogy to the 1/3 state in the _ second _ ll , but not to the 1/3 state in the lowest ll .",
    "that further underscores the need for a better quantitative understanding of the fqhe in the second ll .",
    "wjs and quinn @xcite have argued that the difference between the lll and the @xmath18  ll physics is due to some kind of pairing in the @xmath18  ll .",
    "they study the occupation number of various relative angular momentum @xmath39 channels in the exact ground states for @xmath40 electrons in the spherical geometry and find that as the filling factor is varied ( tuned by the monopole strength @xmath41 in the spherical geometry , which corresponds to @xmath42 flux quanta penetrating the surface of the sphere ) , there are peaks in the occupation of the @xmath43 channel at certain flux values that they identify with @xmath44 .",
    "these findings are taken as evidence for pairing of electrons in the @xmath43 channel .",
    "wjs and quinn thus assign a qualitatively different physics to fqhe in the second ll than that in the lowest ll , as reflected in the fact that , in the spherical geometry , their paired state at 1/3 in the second ll occurs at the ll degeneracy @xmath45 as opposed to @xmath46 for the 1/3 state in the lowest ll .",
    "( the ll degeneracy is related to the monopole strength @xmath41 by @xmath47 in the second ll . )",
    "no explicit wave functions have been constructed for the conjectured paired states which can be compared to the exact wave functions .",
    "it is noted that the likely explanation for the fqhe at @xmath48 @xcite is based on the notion of pairing of composite fermions @xcite described by a pfaffian wave function of moore and read @xcite .",
    "our approach is different .",
    "we attribute the same _ qualitative _ physics to the odd - denominator fqhe in the lowest and the second ll s ( the half filled ll state behaves very differently in the two ll s ) and argue that the _ quantitative _ differences arise because of substantial @xmath0-level mixing in the second ll .",
    "the @xmath0-level mixing is a signature of the residual interaction between cf s .",
    "the negligibility of @xmath0l mixing for the lowest ll fqhe states is taken to imply that the cf s are weakly interacting .",
    "we will see that composite fermions are more strongly interacting in a range of filling factor in the second ll , although not so strongly as to destabilize all fqhe completely . the pairing at 5/2",
    "is already recognized as a consequence of a weak attractive interaction between composite fermions .",
    "the higher ll fqhe has also been investigated by goerbig , lederer and morias - smith  @xcite using the murthy - shankar formulation of composite fermions  @xcite .",
    "they do not consider @xmath0l mixing in their approach .",
    "we will restrict electrons to the second ll and neglect any ll mixing .",
    "( in practice , we map the second ll problem into an effective lowest ll problem , and work within the lll . )",
    "the @xmath0l mixing is treated perturbatively by diagonalizing the full hamiltonian within a correlated basis which includes the  unperturbed \" cf ground state as well as the  unperturbed \" particle - hole pair excitations across @xmath0-levels . this is called cf diagonalization .",
    "the resulting ground state incorporates @xmath0l mixing , and can be improved perturbatively by inclusion of successively higher energy cf excitons . with minimal @xmath0l mixing ( keeping the lowest energy cf exciton )",
    ", cf diagonalization produces explicit wave functions which , when tested against exact wave function , are found to be excellent approximations to the ground states , thus demonstrating that @xmath0l mixing captures the physics of the second ll fqhe .",
    "this will be seen to be the case for the entire filling factor range where the second ll behaves differently from the lowest ll . in particular , for @xmath49 , the overlap with the exact wave function increases from 0.71 to 0.95 ( for six particles in the disk geometry ) upon lowest - order @xmath0l mixing .",
    "the @xmath0l mixing caused by the residual inter - cf interactions has been studied through cf diagonalization previously in various other contexts , for example the quantum dot states @xcite , the luttinger liquid at the edge of the fqhe @xcite , the stability of the fqh liquid state against cf excitons @xcite , and for obtaining improved variational bounds for the fqhe ground state energies in the lowest ll @xcite .",
    "it has quantitative , and sometimes even qualitative consequences .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section shows , by comparison of the exact ground states in the lowest , the second and the third landau levels for six electrons on a disk , that there exists a filling factor range where they behave differently . sec .",

    "however , in practice we find that the monte carlo error is too large for any reasonable number of iterations , perhaps due to the nature of the effective potential ( eq .  [ form ] ) at short distances and the smallness of the gap .",
    "we have shown that the residual interaction between cf s accounts for the deviation of @xmath18  ll fqhe states and the lll fqhe states in certain range of filling factors .",
    "this interaction can be taken into account by allowing for @xmath0l  mixing , i.e. , letting the ground state hybridize with cf particle - hole excitations across @xmath0l s , which is caused by the inter - cf interactions .",
