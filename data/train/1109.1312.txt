    "there is a well - established core population of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) distinguished by striking spectroscopic homogeneity @xcite .",
    "the maximum light ultraviolet - optical - infrared spectra of these sne carry signatures of predominantly intermediate - mass and iron - peak elements ( often identified : oxygen , magnesium , silicon , sulfur , calcium , and iron )",
    ". the consistent presence of these features in the spectra of the sn  ia  core population contrasts with the intermittent detection of carbon lines .",
    "such carbon is detected in the earliest data , but fades away by the time of peak brightness .",
    "sne  ia  probably arise from the thermonuclear incineration of carbon / oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "since carbon is consumed during the explosion , constraints on its quantity , distribution , and incidence in sn  ia  ejecta help identify viable explosion mechanisms . for example , turbulent deflagration models predict that a large amount of unprocessed carbon may be left over ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) while models where the deflagration is followed by a detonation phase can more completely burn it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interpreting oxygen signatures is more ambiguous , since oxygen is produced as well as consumed in the explosion .",
    "thus , constraints on carbon in sne  ia  are expected to be an important piece of the explosion mechanism puzzle .",
    "unfortunately , multiple factors hinder an unbiased accounting of carbon signatures in sn  ia  spectra .",
    "challenges inherent in both discovering and coordinating time - series spectroscopic follow - up of early , nearby sne  ia  result in relatively poor statistics at phases optimal for studying carbon ( i.e. , within 10 days after explosion or before about a week prior to maximum light ) : early observations probe the outermost layers of the sn , the region of the ejecta where carbon is most likely to be found .",
    "optical carbon features are seldom conspicuous even at the earliest phases , so noise may muddle detection in `` screening '' spectra of young sne  ia . to achieve large numbers of sn candidates with a high `` purity '' of early sn  ia  discoveries",
    ", sn surveys must cover as much sky as possible while maintaining a few - day cadence ; a difficult endeavor .",
    "such surveys with associated on - demand access to spectroscopy resources , like the nearby supernova factory ( snfactory , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the palomar transient factory ( ptf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provide a direct way to address the relative lack of spectroscopic time series sustained from the earliest phases .",
    "such data sets provide opportunities to obtain new constraints on sn  ia  physics . by comparison ,",
    "spectra obtained at and after maximum light are already plentiful and well - studied .",
    "the need to understand the sn  ia  explosion mechanism and progenitor system is as critical as ever , especially because of the important role sne  ia  play in observational cosmology .",
    "observations of high - redshift sne  ia  resulted in the discovery of dark energy , a revelation that has changed our view of the universe radically over the past decade .",
    "the universe is not only expanding , but the rate of expansion itself is _ accelerating _ , in contrast to previous expectations that it would be found to be decelerating @xcite .",
    "new techniques show promise for improving sn  ia  distance measurement precision @xcite",
    ". however , the fact that sne  ia  couple dark energy results to stellar evolution astrophysics amplifies concerns that drift in emergent sn properties as a function of redshift could be confused with a cosmology signal .",
    "for example , the demographics of the underlying progenitor population may drift over time , leading to a shift in measured sn properties such as decline rate @xcite .",

    ", we consider the occurrence of unburned carbon in a large set of early phase spectra obtained by the snfactory .",
    "our analysis supplements that of @xcite who conducted the first comprehensive carbon signature survey using publicly available ( and some new ) sn  ia  spectroscopy",
    ". together , our studies find or verify several `` definite '' or `` probable ''  @xmath16580 detections in sne  ia  that are neither super - chandrasekhar candidates nor otherwise obviously peculiar .",
    "six of 27 normal sne  ia  with snfactory observations before @xmath5  d and with sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) have definite  @xmath16580 detections .",
    "such normal sne are the foundation of the sn  ia  hubble diagram ; studying observables correlated with the incidence of carbon may provide new constraints on the explosion mechanism , leading to new systematics controls or ruling out the need for some . in particular , we are interested in addressing the question of whether carbon - positivity in sne  ia  is idiosyncratic ( distributed randomly within the population without regard to other observables like light curve shape or color ) or specifically correlated with other parameters .",
    "for example , if the frequency ( or strength , or persistence ) of carbon signatures is somehow correlated with luminosity or light - curve shape , explosion models need to reproduce this relationship .",
    "our results are the strongest indication so far of such a connection between carbon - positivity and broad - band photometric properties in normal sne  ia .",

    "snifs is mounted on the south bent cassegrain port of the university of hawaii 2.2  m telescope on mauna kea , and is operated remotely .",

    "* ) .    to help identify candidate carbon features , we systematically conduct fits to the relevant portion of each spectrum using the ` synapps `  code @xcite . `",
    "synapps `  uses a highly parameterized but fast sn spectrum synthesis technique , and as such does not solve the full model sn atmospheres problem , in contrast to programs like ` phoenix `  @xcite , ` cmfgen `  @xcite , or ` sedona `  @xcite .",
    "the other codes mentioned are examples designed for full / partial non - local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer , enabling detailed post - processing of stellar explosion models for comparison to observations . `",
    "synapps `  is useful in the opposite sense , producing constraints on explosion models from observations , since it identifies ion species and estimates their characteristic ejection velocities . given the schematic radiative transfer model that ` synapps `  uses and its as yet unquantified systematic uncertainty , we employ the fit results as an adjunct in our examination of the spectra rather than as a direct quantitative discriminant . the radiative transfer assumptions underlying ` synapps `  match those of the well - known ` synow `  sn spectrum synthesis program @xcite : spherical symmetry , a sharply - defined blackbody - emitting pseudo - photosphere , pure - resonance line transfer under sobolev formalism , with line opacity parameterized radially using convenient functional forms and in wavelength assuming boltzmann excitation . `",
    "synapps `  combines this parameterized spectrum synthesis calculation with a parallel non - linear optimization framework @xcite to reduce the need for tedious interactive adjustment of fit parameters and to assure more systematic sampling of the parameter space .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but it is problematic : it does not seem to produce a reliable , distinct feature in the spectrum , and is vastly weaker than  @xmath16580 at the relevant temperatures .",
    "there is some evidence for the high - excitation  @xmath14649 line in the spectra of sn  1999aa - like @xcite and sn  1991t - like @xcite sne  ia , but it is the only strong optical feature and is not reliably detected in the spectra of less luminous objects .",
    "lines are mostly too red or too weak ( e.g. , @xmath1@xmath19087 , 9406 , 10693 ) for us to consider with snifs data @xcite . thus ,  @xmath16580 seems to be the best choice , especially considering the observational constraints .",
    "as @xcite demonstrated ( their figure  9 ) ,  @xmath16580 absorptions caused by carbon at higher velocities ( much faster than that at the photosphere at the phases of interest ) will disappear into the  @xmath16355 absorption trough where they can not be detected reliably .",
    "hence , inferences about carbon from the  @xmath16580 notch are limited to lower velocities .",
    "fortunately , the low velocity regime is what is of greatest interest for constraining the explosion mechanism .",
    "carbon at the highest velocities may not be surprising ; the presence of carbon is much more variable at lower velocities in existing models .",
    "a final , but related , issue worthy of mention is the systematic error that could be incurred when estimating the ejection velocity of carbon directly from the position of the absorption notch instead of with the aid of modeling , that of center - to - limb variation @xcite . without the aid of any kind of spectral modeling",
    ", the velocity of the carbon layer could be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 . however , ` synapps `  ( at least ) handles line blending explicitly , and the velocity at the photosphere will be estimated by a fit to the full spectrum , so we can be reasonably confident that the carbon is located near or just above the photosphere .",

    "strong iron - peak lines only become important after the phases considered here .",
    "a second - order polynomial warping function multiplied against the synthetic spectrum is included to mitigate limitations of the parameterized model continuum , which does not affect our ability to detect a  @xmath16580 absorption `` notch , '' a much smaller scale feature . since ` synapps `  models the sn spectrum but not the intervening gas",
    ", we mask out rest - frame wavelengths between 5875 and 5915  , a generous allowance to exclude host galaxy interstellar ( or circumstellar )  d contamination , based on the width of the strongest  d feature observed in the sample ( snf20080720 - 001 , * ? ? ?",
    "all spectra presented and fit by ` synapps `  are corrected for observer - frame milky way ( @xmath11 ) extinction using the ccm @xcite dust law , with color excess estimates from @xcite .",
    "three fits are performed to each spectrum to find candidate features .",
    "the first set of fits including only , , and provides a carbon - free baseline .",
    "the second set of fits adds with a `` photospheric '' sobolev optical depth profile , meaning that the minimum velocity of the profile is constrained to equal the velocity at the photosphere .",
    "the third set of fits substitutes a `` detached '' optical depth profile , with the minimum velocity of the profile unconstrained with respect to the photospheric velocity . in all 3 fits ,",
    "the sobolev opacity declines with velocity exponentially .",
    "a set of fits allowing opacity to be detached was also performed , but in practically all cases ` synapps `  found a better fit without detachment .    some of the targets included in the analysis have previously been identified or suspected of being carbon - positive , in particular snf20080514 - 002 @xcite .",
    "to reduce ( somewhat ) the risk of confirmation bias , the process of organizing and executing the fits includes concealing the identity of the parent sn of each spectrum and its phase .",
    "this is accomplished by shuffling the spectra and assigning a unique integer identifier to each .",
    "the mapping from spectrum to sn and phase is kept in a hash file that is only consulted after the carbon detections have been made .",
    "this procedure , along with the ` synapps`fitting , forced us to consider more spectra more carefully .",
    "it also concealed the measured light curve fit parameters while identifying strong carbon features , ensuring that any correlation between them and the presence of carbon would also be uncovered without bias .    for a detection to be considered definitive , we require that be detected in at least 2 spectra of an object s time - series , either from the same night of observation or across multiple consecutive nights .",
    "the final identifications are confirmed by visual inspection and comparison of the fits in the region of the @xmath16355 emission peak .",
    "cases where the fits with and without are basically identical are considered non - detections ( the addition of opacity does not improve the fit ) . fits with that differ from the baseline fit , and moreover improve upon it , are flagged for closer scrutiny .",
    "several example fits are shown in figure  [ fig : feature ] . while the detailed agreement in all cases is not perfect , the ` synapps `  fits greatly improve our confidence in the identifications we otherwise would have made purely by visual inspection . `",
    "synapps `  also highlighted cases we might have overlooked , but in practice few of these cases ultimately made it into the sample , usually because they fail the 2-spectrum cut or were less convincing .",

    "instead , we use a different procedure to investigate whether sn  2005di could simply be a reddened member of the fast - decliner / blue - color subclass .    to see if this is at least a plausible hypothesis , we warp the spectral time series of sn  2005di according to the ccm dust law , fitting for the optimal differential @xmath46 that brings the spectra into detailed agreement above 5000    with each of sne  2005el , 2005ki and snf20080514 - 002 .",

    "our data suggest that unburned carbon , while far from ubiquitous , is also not particularly rare  in line with the result of @xcite .",
    "a detailed rate calculation is beyond the scope of this article , but we can try to estimate the frequency of photospheric - velocity carbon in normal sne  ia  based on the latest phase ( @xmath37  d ) and lowest median s / n per 2.4    bin in the wavelength range of interest ( 11.7 , that of sn  2005di at @xmath49  d ) where  @xmath16580 is detected .",

    "optical light curve analysis for sn  2008hv is yet to be published , but a preliminary decline - rate estimate from the uvot photometry appears to be faster than average .",
    "next , we consider whether normal sne  ia  with previous  @xmath16580 detections in the literature have a tendency towards narrow light curves and blue colors .",

    "is there a particularly strong case for deviation from basically spherical composition symmetry . a dominant axis in the stokes q / u diagram is at least identifiable for sn  2005el , suggestive of some combination of global and smaller scale asymmetries .",
    "while spectropolarimetry may be more definitive for constraining the geometry of the unburned material , it is interesting to consider the constraints we can set with our pure flux measurements .",
    "the comparison of synthetic spectra with and without shown in figure  [ fig : closeup ] suggests that the spatial distribution of unburned carbon in the ejecta may be quite consistent with spherical symmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : blending ] demonstrates our reasoning simply , using toy model synthetic line profiles .",
    "the classic sn spectroscopic feature formed by a single line is plotted at the top of figure  [ fig : blending ] : blueshifted absorption produced by material in front of the photosphere and expanding toward the observer , with an emission hump centered at the rest wavelength of the line arising from material adjacent to the photosphere in projection . for discussion purposes , we label this line `` line a '' and assign it a rest wavelength of 6355   .",
    "consider a second line , `` line b '' with rest wavelength 6580   , a doppler shift of @xmath38  km  s@xmath3 , a shift quite similar to the cases seen in the data .",
    "if the ejecta bearing the parent ions of line b are distributed in a `` blob '' that only partially covers the photosphere and/or line a emissivity in projection , it is quite easy to construct a line b absorption notch blended with the line a emission component .",
    "an example of the resulting blend appears in the middle of figure  [ fig : blending ] , overlaid on the line a profile .    now , suppose the line b ions are distributed spherically symmetrically . in this case , a quite different blended profile results . line b notches can be produced , but not without additional disruption of the line a profile .",
    "flux redward of the notch is suppressed and there is even a mild red emission feature relative to the single unblended line a case .",
    "such a blend is depicted at the bottom of figure  [ fig : blending ] , again overlaid on the single line a profile for comparison .    because line b opacity does not encircle the photosphere in the blob case , its effect is restricted to wavelengths corresponding roughly to where the blob is optically thick in blueshift parallel to the line of sight . however , when line b ions are distributed under spherical symmetry , the photosphere is cocooned by them , and they scatter away continuum and line a photons alike over a larger range of projected velocity .",
    "this results in the notch , the flux suppression to the red of it , and the small emission further on . essentially , the driving factor is the projected area over which line b photons screen continuum but also line a emissivity , at a given wavelength .",
    "the fits in figure  [ fig : closeup ] appear more consistent with the spherically symmetric case demonstrated in figure  [ fig : blending ] .",
    "our toy models are quite simple , but illustrate the leading - order screening effect quite clearly . at the very least ,",
    "our results highlight the critical need for detailed spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry of sne  ia  at early phases to make the most definitive conclusions about the geometry of the carbon ejecta .",
    "the possible existence of a family of sne  ia  with similar properties to those demonstrated by sn  2005el , sn  2005ki , snf20080514 - 002 , and perhaps sn  2005di , is particularly intriguing .",
    "the combination of a narrow light curve , large uv excess or at least blue colors , and the presence of photospheric velocity carbon suggests a very particular conceptual picture . a faster than average decline rate indicates lower than average luminosity for a sn  ia , in turn suggesting a lower than average mass of freshly synthesized radioactive nickel .",
    "the blue colors suggest that the amount of iron - peak elements synthesized or mixed into the outer layers is low ( suppressing line - blanketing at shorter wavelengths ) , and these elements are limited to lower velocities .",
    "also , a relatively high carbon abundance in the material above the photosphere indicates less efficient processing of the white dwarf progenitor material .",
    "the above picture is somewhat consistent with a subset or region of delayed - detonation model space .",
    "estimates of the mass fraction of photospheric carbon in sne  ia  are generally low ( of order 1% , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are also generally consistent with most such models . of particular interest",
    "is the recent grid of multi - dimensional models presented by @xcite . in these models ,",
    "a strong ignition ( arising from numerous initiating sparks ) raises the amount of burning that takes place during the initial sub - sonic deflagration phase .",
    "this allows the outer , unburned layers to pre - expand more relative to the weaker ignition case .",
    "when the later detonation wave passes through the pre - expanded material , nuclear burning is less efficient and the abundance of iron - peak elements is lower relative to the weak ignition case .",
    "this results in relatively lower radioactive nickel mass which is more centrally peaked in the ejecta .",
    "however , the total amount of unburned carbon left in these models is below 1% by mass , and the s / n of the synthesized monte carlo spectra is too low to attempt to detect any carbon signatures in them .",
    "this result is actually at variance to earlier ( one - dimensional ) delayed - detonation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where some amount of unburned carbon can be left behind .",
    "simply put , the multi - dimensional model grids may not yet be extensive enough .    in most of the carbon - positive sne  ia  discussed here",
    ", there seems to be intriguing evidence that the carbon is distributed roughly spherically symmetrically , and at velocities overlapping silicon .",
    "there may still be room for deviation from spherical symmetry in the distribution of unburned material that we can not rule out here .",
    "for example , large scale asymmetries , such as proposed by @xcite to explain spectroscopic diversity , may allow for almost hemispherical covering of the photosphere by carbon .",
    "in that particular picture , an offset ignition in the white dwarf progenitor yields an asymmetric distribution of burning products .",
    "this scenario is proposed to explain the origin of `` high - velocity gradient '' ( hvg ) and `` low - velocity gradient '' ( lvg ) subclasses of sne  ia , segregated by the rate of decrease in measured  @xmath16355 blue - shift with time @xcite .",
    "viewed from the side closest to the ignition , one observes an lvg sn  ia ; and viewed from the other an hvg sn  ia .",
    "detonation products are distributed in the outer layers in all directions , but it is not yet clear how complete the burning is .",
    "interestingly , @xcite remarked that of 3 lvg sne  ia  they studied , all had marginally detected  @xmath16580 , and blue colors .",
    "their analysis suggests that lvg sne  ia  undergo less intense burning than their counterparts .",
    "a systematic examination of  @xmath16355 blueshift evolution of snfactory sne  ia  is in progress , but our preliminary results indicate that all 5 objects identified here are also lvg members .",
    "whether or not a @xcite scenario is capable of explaining all the observables , and can yield carbon amounts and distributions consistent with observations , remains to be seen through detailed multi - dimensional explosion modeling and radiative transfer .",
    "we have presented new detections of carbon signatures in the spectra of several sne  ia . for the most part ,",
    "the carbon - positive sne are normal spectroscopically , with the only significant deviation being the presence of hv and in one of them .",
    "four of the 5 objects discussed may form a robust subfamily of sne  ia  with a relatively fast decline rate and intrinsically blue colors .",
    "the carbon is detected at velocities consistent with the ejection velocity at the photosphere , and in the same velocity range as other freshly synthesized material .",
    "the distribution of carbon is apparently consistent with spherical or near - spherical symmetry .",
    "the behavior of most of the carbon - positive sne  ia  discussed here suggests strong radial abundance stratification , consistent with some delayed detonation models .",
    "only one of the objects uncovered in the course of our analysis has ever been previously identified in the literature as carbon - positive , either at the time of initial spectroscopic classification or in subsequent analysis .",
    "our intent in pointing this out is not to criticize ; indeed we have highlighted cases that earlier escaped our notice as well . rather , we suggest that the  @xmath16580 notch signature is not well - known , easy to overlook , or easy to mistake for a reduction artifact .",
    "in fact , this is part of why we required 2 spectra for labeling detections as definitive .",
    "the examples provided here should help to sensitize observers to carbon signatures in early - phase sn  ia  spectra .",
    "understanding the frequency , distribution , and amount of unburned carbon in sne  ia  is indeed a useful discriminator among competing explosion models , so constraints on theory depend on reliable and efficient early triggering of spectroscopic ( and spectropolarimetric ) follow - up of sne  ia  for detailed study . as current sn",
    "ia  cosmology efforts approach their limits in terms of calibration and empirical standardization , enhancing our understanding of sn  ia  physics becomes all the more important .",
