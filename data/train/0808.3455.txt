    "the electron temperature gradient ( etg ) driven mode @xcite is often considered as a possible candidate for the explanation of electron thermal transport through internal transport barriers when ion temperature gradient ( itg ) turbulent fluctuations are suppressed by @xmath1 shear flow . at the same time , small scale etg fluctuations have the typical spatial scale of the order of electron gyroradius @xmath2 , and are less susceptible to quenching by shearing @xcite .",
    "it is widely thought that drift - wave - type turbulence can excite zonal flows which are associated with azimuthally symmetric band - like shear flows that depend only on the radial coordinate @xcite .",
    "zonal flows play a crucial role in regulating drift - wave turbulence and transport in tokamaks .",
    "it is now quite clear that zonal flows are generated by modulational instability of drift waves @xcite . for etg driven turbulence ,",

    "it is well known that the presence of shear flow give rise not only to instability of the sheared layer ( kelvin  helmholtz instability ) , but also to stabilization of other instabilities ( itg driven modes , resistive interchange modes etc . ) @xcite . up to now ,",
    "the stabilizing effect on the linear instabilities has been considered only for the case of mean smooth flows .",
    "note , that zonal flow shearing differs from that for mean flow shearing on account of the complexity of the flow pattern .",
    "in contrast to smooth , static mean flows , the zonal flow patterns can be expected to have finite correlation time and complex , possibly random , spatial structure @xcite .    in the present work we consider the influence of zonal flow on the linear stability of etg drift modes .",
    "we show that the presence of random shearing by zonal flows strongly affects the linear stability of etg modes and has a stabilizing effect .",
