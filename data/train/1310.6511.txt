    "energy efficiency is of paramount importance for future communication networks and is a main design target for all 5 g radio access solutions .",
    "it refers to an efficient utilization of the available energy and consequently extends the network lifetime and/or reduces the operation cost .",
    "specifically , conventional battery - powered communication systems suffer from short lifetime and require periodic replacement or recharging in order to maintain network connectivity .",
    "on the other hand , communication systems that are supported by a continuous power supply such as cellular networks require a power grid infrastructure and may result in large energy consumption that will further increase due to the increasing growth of data traffic .",
    "the investigation of energy - aware architectures as well as transmission techniques / protocols that prolong the lifetime of the networks or provide significant energy savings has been a hot research area over several years , often under the umbrella of the green radio / communications @xcite .",
    "due to the limited supply of non - renewable energy resources , recently , there is a lot of interest to integrate the energy harvesting ( eh ) technology to power communication networks @xcite .",
    "energy harvesting is a new paradigm and allows nodes to harvest energy from natural resources ( i.e. , solar energy , wind , mechanical vibrations etc . ) in order to maintain their operation .",
    "related literature concerns the optimization of different network utility functions under various assumptions on the knowledge of the energy profiles .",
    "the works in @xcite assume that the eh profile is perfectly known at the transmitters and investigate optimal resource allocation techniques for different objective functions and network configurations .",
    "on the other hand , the works in @xcite adopt a more networking point of view and maximize the performance in terms of stability region by assuming only statistical knowledge of the eh profile .",
    "although energy harvesting from natural resources is a promising technology towards fully autonomous and self - sustainable communication networks , it is mainly unstable ( i.e. , weather - dependent ) and thus less efficient for applications with critical quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements .",
    "an interesting solution that overcomes the above limitation is to harvest energy from man - made electromagnetic radiation . despite the pioneering work of tesla , who experimentally demonstrated wireless energy transfer ( wet ) in late 19th century , modern wireless communication systems mainly focus on the information content of the radio - frequency ( rf ) radiation , neglecting the energy transported by the signals .",
    "recently , there is a lot of interest to exploit rf radiation from energy harvesting perspective and use wireless energy transfer in order to power communication devices .",
    "the fundamental block for the implementation of this technology is the rectifying - antenna ( rectenna ) which is a diode - based circuit that converts the rf signals to dc voltage .",
    "several rectenna architectures and designs have been proposed in the literature for different systems and frequency bands @xcite .",
    "an interesting rectenna architecture is reported in @xcite , where the authors study a rectenna array in order to further boost the harvesting efficiency .",
    "although information theoretic studies ideally assume that a receiver is able to decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal @xcite , this approach is not feasible due to practical limitations . in the seminal work in @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce two practical rf energy harvesting mechanisms for `` simultaneous '' information and energy transfer : a ) time switching ( ts ) where dedicated time slots are used either for information transfer or energy harvesting , b ) power splitting ( ps ) where one part of the received signal is used for information decoding , while the other part is used for rf energy harvesting .",
    "the employment of the above two practical approaches in different fundamental network structures , is a hot research topic and several recent works appear in the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the problem of beamforming design for a point - to - point multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel and characterize the rate - energy region for both ts and ps techniques .",
    "this work is extended in @xcite for the case of an imperfect channel information at the transmitter by using robust optimization tools .",
    "the work in @xcite investigates the optimal ps rule for a single - input single - output ( siso ) channel in order to achieve different trade - offs between ergodic capacity and average harvested energy .",
    "an interesting problem is discussed in @xcite , where the downlink of an access point broadcasts energy to several users , which then use the harvested energy for time - division multiple access ( tdma ) uplink transmissions . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study a fundamental multi - user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) channel where the single - antenna receivers are characterized by both qos and ps - eh constraints . on the other hand ,",
    "cooperative / relay networks is a promising application area for rf energy harvesting , since relay nodes have mainly limited energy reserves and may require external energy assistance .",
    "the works in @xcite deal with the integration of both ts and ps techniques in various cooperative topologies with / without batteries for energy storage .",
    "the simultaneous information / energy transfer for a mimo relay channel with a separated energy harvesting receiver is discussed in @xcite .",
    "although several studies deal with the analysis of communication networks with rf energy harvesting capabilities , most of existing work refers to specific ( fixed ) single / multiple user network configurations . since harvesting efficiency is associated with the interference and thus the geometric distance between nodes , a fundamental question is to study rf energy harvesting for large - scale networks by taking into account random node locations .",
    "stochastic - geometry is a useful theoretical tool in order to model the geometric characteristics of a large - scale network and derive its statistical properties @xcite .",
    "several works in the literature adopt stochastic - geometry in order to analyze the outage probability performance or the transmission capacity for different conventional ( without harvesting capabilities ) networks e.g. , @xcite .",
    "large - scale networks with energy harvesting capabilities are studied in @xcite for different network topologies and performance metrics .",
    "these works model the energy harvesting operation as a stochastic process and mainly refer to energy harvesting from natural resources e.g. , solar , wind , etc .",
    "however , few studies analyze the behavior of a rf energy harvesting network from a stochastic - geometry standpoint . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the interaction between primary and cognitive radio networks , where cognitive radio nodes can harvest energy from the primary transmissions , by modeling node locations as poisson point processes ( ppps ) .",
    "a cooperative network with multiple transmitter - receiver pairs and a single energy harvesting relay is studied in @xcite by taking the spatial randomness of user locations into consideration .",
    "the analysis of large - scale rf energy harvesting networks with practical ts / ps techniques , is an open question in the literature .    in this paper , we study the performance of a large - scale network with multiple transmitter - receiver pairs , where transmitters are connected to the power grid , while receivers employ the ps technique for rf energy harvesting . by using stochastic - geometry , we model the randomness of node locations and we analyze the fundamental trade - off between outage probability performance and average harvested energy . specifically , we study two main protocols : a ) a non - cooperative protocol , and b ) a cooperative protocol with orthogonal relay assistance . in the non - cooperative protocol ,",
    "each transmitter simultaneously transfers information and energy at the associated receiver via the direct link .",
    "the outage probability of the system as well as the average harvested energy are derived in closed form in function of the power splitting ratio .",
    "in addition , an optimization problem which minimizes the transmitted power under some well - defined outage probability and average harvesting constraints , is discussed and closed form solutions are provided .",
    "the cooperative protocol is introduced to show that relaying can significantly improve the performance of the system and achieve a better trade - off between outage probability performance and energy harvesting transfer .",
    "relaying cooperation is integrated in several systems and standards in order to provide different levels of assistance ( i.e. , cooperative diversity , energy savings , secrecy etc ) ; in this work , relays are used in order to facilitate the information / energy transfer . for the cooperative protocol",
    ", we introduce a set of potential dynamic - and - forward ( df ) relays , which are randomly distributed in the network according to a ppp ; these relays have similar characteristics with the transmitters and are also connected to the power grid . in this case , information and energy can be received at each destination via two independent paths ( in case of cooperation ) . for the relay selection ,",
    "we adopt a random selection policy based on a sectorized selection area with central angle at the direction of each receiver .",
    "the outage performance of the system for a selection combining ( sc ) scheme as well as the average harvested energy are analyzed in closed form and validate the cooperative diversity benefits .",
    "numerical results for different parameter set - up reveal some important observations about the impact of the central angle and relay density on the trade - off between information and energy transfer .",
    "it is the first time , to the best of the authors knowledge , that stochastic - geometry is used in order to analyze a ps energy harvesting network with / without relaying .",
