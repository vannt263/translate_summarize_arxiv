    "secure network coding offers a method securely transmitting information from the authorized sender to the authorized receiver .",
    "cai and yeung @xcite discussed the secrecy for the malicious adversary , eve , wiretapping a subset @xmath0 of all channels in the network . using the universal hashing lemma @xcite , the papers @xcite showed the existence of a secrecy code that universally works for any types of eavesdroppers under the size constraint of @xmath0 . also , the paper @xcite discussed construction of such a code .    as another attack to information transmission via the network ,",
    "the malicious adversary contaminates the communication by contaminating the information on a subset @xmath1 of all channels in the network . using the method of error correction , the papers @xcite proposed a method to protect the message from the contamination .",
    "the correctness of the recovered message by the authorized receiver is called robustness .",
    "now , for simplicity , we consider the unicast setting . when the transmission rate from the authorized sender , alice to the authorized receiver , bob is @xmath2 and the rate of noise injected by eve is @xmath3 , using the result of the papers @xcite the paper @xcite showed that there exists a sequence of asymptotically correctable code with the rate @xmath4 if the rate of information leakage to eve is less than @xmath4",
    ".    however , there is a possibility that the malicious adversary makes a combination of eavesdropping and the contamination .",
    "that is , contaminating a part of channels , the malicious adversary might improve the ability of eavesdropping . in this paper , we discuss the secrecy when eve eavesdrops the information on the channels in @xmath0 , and adds artificial information to the information on the channels in @xmath1 sequentially based on the obtained information .",
    "we call such an active operation a strategy . when @xmath5 , under this assumption eve is allowed to arbitrarily modify the information on the channels in @xmath1 sequentially based on the obtained information",
    ".    the aim of this paper is the following .",
    "firstly , we show that any strategy can not improve eve s information when the any operations in the network are linear .",
    "then , to clarify the necessity of the linearity assumption , we give a counterexample for the non - linear network , in which , there exists a strategy to improve eve s information .",
    "this example shows the importance of the assumption of the linearity .",
    "also , when the transmission rate from alice to bob is @xmath2 , the rate of noise injected by eve is @xmath3 , and the rate of information leakage to eve is @xmath6 , we discuss a code satisfying the secrecy and the robustness . in the asymptotic",
    "setting , we show the existence of such a secure protocol with the rate @xmath7 .    the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] formulates our problem and shows the impossibility of eve s eavesdropping under the linear network .",
    "section [ s4 ] gives a counterexample in the non - linear case .",
    "section [ s3 ] discusses the asymptotic setting , and show the achievability of the asymptotic rate @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the unicast setting .",
    "assume that the authorized sender , alice , and the authorized receiver , bob , are linked via a network with the set of edges @xmath8 , where the operations on all nodes are linear on the finite filed @xmath9 with prime power @xmath10 .",
    "alice inputs the input variable @xmath11 in @xmath12 and bob receives the output variable @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "we also assume that the malicious adversary , eve , wiretaps the information @xmath15 in @xmath16 on the edges of a subset @xmath17 .",
    "now , we fix the topology and dynamics ( operations on the intermediate nodes ) of the network .",
    "when we assume all operations on the intermediate nodes are linear on @xmath12 , there exist matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that the variables @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 satisfy their relations @xmath20 that is , the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are decided from the network topology and dynamics .",
    "we call this attack the _ passive attack_.    to address the active attack , we consider stronger eve , i.e. , we assume that eve adds an error @xmath23 in @xmath24 on the edges of a subset @xmath25 . using matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "we rewrite the above relations as @xmath28 which is called the _ wiretap and addition model_.    now , to consider the time ordering among the edges in @xmath8 , we assign the numbers to all elements of @xmath8 such that @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the information transmission on each edge is done with this order . in this representation ,",
    "the elements of @xmath23 and @xmath15 are arranged in this order .",
    "hence , the elements of the subsets @xmath0 and @xmath1 are expressed as @xmath30 and @xmath31 by using two strictly increasing functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the causality yields that @xmath34 it is natural that eve can choose the information to be added in the edge @xmath35 based on the information obtained previously on the edges in the subset @xmath36 .",
    "that is , the added error @xmath23 is given as a function @xmath37 of @xmath38 , which can be regarded as eve s strategy .",
    "we call this attack the _ active attack _ with the strategy @xmath39 .",
    "now , we consider the @xmath40-transmission setting , in which , alice uses the same network @xmath40 times to send the message to bob .",
    "alice s input variable ( eve s added variable ) is given as a matrix @xmath41 ( a matrix @xmath42 ) , and bob s ( eve s ) received variable is given as a matrix @xmath43 ( a matrix @xmath44 ) .",
    "we assume that the topology and dynamics of the network and the edge attacked by eve are not changed during @xmath40 transmissions .",
    "their relation is given as @xmath45    to discuss the secrecy , we formulate a code .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the message set and the set of values of the scramble random number .",
    "then , an encoder is given as a function @xmath48 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , and the decoder is given as @xmath51 from @xmath52 to @xmath46 .",
    "our code is the pair @xmath53 , and is denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "then , we denote the message and the scramble random number by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath46 is called the size of the code and is denoted by @xmath57 .    here",
    ", we treat @xmath58 as deterministic values , and denote the pairs @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . in the following , we fix @xmath63 . as a measure of the leaked information",
    ", we adopt the mutual information @xmath64 between @xmath55 and eve s information @xmath65 and @xmath66 since the variable @xmath66 is given as a function of @xmath65 , we have @xmath67 .",
    "since the leaked information is given as a function of @xmath63 in this situation , we denote it by @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "when we always choose @xmath69 , the attack is the same as the passive attack .",
    "this strategy is denoted by @xmath70 . when @xmath71 are treated as random variables independent of @xmath72 , the leaked information is given as the expectation of @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "this probabilistic setting expresses the situation that eve can not necessarily choose her position to attack by herself while she knows the position , and chooses her strategy dependently of the position .",
    "now , we have the following theorem .    for any eve s",
    "strategy @xmath39 , eve s information @xmath65 with strategy @xmath39 and that with strategy @xmath70 can be simulated by each other .",
    "hence , we have the equation @xmath73 = i(m;y_e^n)[\\phi_n,\\bm{k},\\bm{h},\\alpha].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this theorem shows that the information leakage of the active attack with the strategy @xmath39 is the same as the information leakage of the passive attack .",
    "hence , to guarantee the secrecy under an arbitrary active attack , it is sufficient to show the secrecy under the passive attack .",
    "we define two random variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "eve can simulate her outcome @xmath76 under the strategy @xmath39 from @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath66 .",
    "so , we have @xmath79 .",
    "conversely , since @xmath77 is given as a function of @xmath76 , @xmath66 , and @xmath78 , we have the opposite inequality .    to compare the passive attack with the active attack , we count the number of choices of both attacks . in the passive attack ,",
    "when we fix the rank of @xmath22 ( the dimension of leaked information ) , by taking account into the equivalent class , the number of the possible choices is upper bounded by @xmath80 . in the active attack case , this calculation is more complicated . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case with @xmath81 . now",
    ", we do not count the choice for the inputs on the edge @xmath82 with @xmath83 because it does not effects eve s information . then , even when we fix the matrices @xmath84 , the number of choices of @xmath39 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "notice that @xmath87 when @xmath5 . if we count the choice on the remaining edges , we need to multiply @xmath88 on . for general @xmath40 ,",
    "the number of choices of @xmath39 is @xmath89    the above analysis discusses the case when eve adds the error @xmath23 .",
    "however , eve might replace the information on the edges in @xmath1 by another elements @xmath90 , which is called the _ wiretap and replacement model_. this situation has different network structure . by using matrices @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 different from @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath95 and @xmath78 ,",
    "the observations @xmath13 and @xmath15 are given as @xmath96 however , when the set @xmath1 is the same as the set @xmath0 , it is allowed to employ the original model and because any strategy with the model and can be written as a strategy with the original model and .",
    "theorem [ t1 ] discusses the unicast case .",
    "it can be trivially extended to the multicast case because we do not discuss the decoder .",
    "it also can be extended to the multiple unicast case , in which , there are several pairs of sender and receiver . when there are @xmath97 pairs in this setting , the random variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 have the forms @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "so , we can apply the discussion of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "to clarify the impossibility of theorem [ t1 ] under the non - linear network , we show a counter example composed of non - linear operations . we consider the network given in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , whose edges are @xmath100 . each edge @xmath101 is assumed to send the binary information @xmath102 .",
    "the intermediate node makes the non - linear operation as @xmath103    to send the binary information @xmath104 , we prepare the binary uniform scramble random variable @xmath105 .",
    "we consider the following code .",
    "the encoder @xmath106 is given as @xmath107 the decoder @xmath108 is given as @xmath109 .    since",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 are given as follows under this code ; @xmath112 the decoder can recover @xmath55 nevertheless the value of @xmath56 .",
    "now , we consider the leaked information for the passive attack .",
    "eve is allowed to attack two edges of @xmath8 except for the pairs @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the mutual information of these cases are calculated to @xmath115 in this section , we choose the base of the logarithm to be @xmath116 .",
    "now , we consider the active attack with @xmath5 of the above four cases .",
    "( i ) : :    when @xmath117 , eve replaces    @xmath118 by @xmath119 . then ,    @xmath120 because @xmath121 .",
    "( ii ) : :    when @xmath122 , eve replaces    @xmath118 by @xmath70 .",
    "then ,    @xmath120 because @xmath123 .",
    "( iii ) : :    when @xmath124 or    @xmath125 , eve has no good active attack .    to see the difference from the linear case ,",
    "we adopt a weak secrecy criterion in this section .",
    "when @xmath15 is eve s information and @xmath126 for all of eve s possible attack , we say that the code is secure . otherwise , it is called insecure .    when eve is allowed to use the above passive attack ,",
    "shows that the code is secure .",
    "when eve is allowed to use the above active attack , the above calculation shows that the code is insecure .",
    "therefore , this example is a counter example of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "our analysis covers the optimal codes . as another encoder",
    ", we can consider @xmath127 replacing @xmath128 by @xmath56 , the analysis can be reduced to the presented analysis .",
    "other encoders clearly leaks the message @xmath55 to @xmath129 or @xmath130 .    in this model , eve can",
    "perfectly contaminates the message @xmath55 .",
    "when eve take the choice ( i ) , and replace @xmath110 by @xmath131 , bob s decoded message is @xmath132 . under the choice ( ii ) ,",
    "eve can perfectly contaminates the message @xmath55 in a similar way .",
    "next , under the same assumption as section [ s2 ] , we consider the asymptotic setting by taking account into robustness as well as secrecy .",
    "we have assumed that the topology and dynamics of network and the edge attacked by eve are not changed during @xmath40 transmission .",
    "now , we assume that eve knows these matrices and alice and bob know none of them because alice and bob often do not know the topology and dynamics of the network the edge attacked by eve .",
    "when eve adds the error @xmath66 , there is a possibility that bob can not recover the original information @xmath55 .",
    "this problem is called the _ robustness _ , and may be regarded as a kind of error correction . under the conventional error correction ,",
    "the error @xmath66 is treated as a random variable subject to the uniform distribution . however , our problem is different from the conventional error correction .",
    "since the decoding error probability depends of the strategy @xmath39 .",

    "we fix @xmath189 .",
    "now , we choose a universal2 linear random hash function @xmath173 from @xmath171 to @xmath190 .",
    "to make our code , we consider a virtual protocol as follows .",
    "first , alice sends her larger message @xmath55 by using the code @xmath54 , and bob recovers it .",
    "second , alice randomly chooses @xmath176 deciding the hash function @xmath173 and sends it to bob via public channel .",
    "finally , alice and bob apply the hash function @xmath173 to their message , and denote the result value by @xmath191 so that alice and bob share the information @xmath191 with probability almost close to @xmath119 .",
