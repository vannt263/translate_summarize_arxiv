    "_ motivation . _ in multi - agent systems like social networks or a group of mobile robots completing a task , agent behavior is determined by local interactions between neighboring agents . in distributed control problems ,",
    "reaching a consensus state is often necessary for the agents to achieve a control objective @xcite . within the context of distributed sensor fusion , the agents exchange evidence to eventually have a good estimate of unknown parameters @xcite .",
    "agents in a social network typically exchange opinions in some manner with their neighbors , and update their own opinions , possibly resulting in consensus .",
    "the work in @xcite discusses models of opinion diffusion among rational agents and social learning , explaining how opinions emerge or fail to emerge in contexts of economics and social sciences .",
    "understanding the conditions under which a group of agents will reach a possible consensus in a network with time - varying links is a challenging problem that has recently garnered much interest .    _",
    "previous work .",
    "_ previous work within signal processing , control , and data fusion geared towards analyzing agent consensus formation has mostly modeled an agent state as a real - valued vector @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while such an assumption is useful in the context of agents achieving consensus on a control vector , or sensing network agents achieving a consensus signal estimate , the assumption of a real - valued vector may not necessarily be always suitable within higher - level fusion , or the analysis of opinion dynamics in social networks . in higher - level fusion",
    ", agents could reach a consensus assessment regarding a situation , while in opinion dynamics , agents gravitate to reach a possible consensus opinion .",
    "the inherent uncertainty within such applications may necessitate a more structured agent state vector such as a probability mass function ( p.m.f . ) or an imprecise probabilisitic formalism , such as _ dempster - shafer ( ds ) theory _ @xcite .",
    "agent states / opinions in complex fusion environments and social networks involve more qualitative and nuanced information and hence are associated with higher and a wider variety of uncertainties .",
    "uncertainty modeling formalisms based on imprecise probability , such as ds theory , provide a convenient framework for such scenarios .",
    "the ds theoretic ( dst ) framework stands apart from alternate uncertainty handling frameworks ( such as , fuzzy sets , rough sets , etc . ) in that it bears a close relationship to the probabilistic framework @xcite .",
    "dst models converge to and/or can be converted to p.m.f .",
    "models in limiting cases , thus allowing for a swift generalization of legacy techniques .",
    "moreover , dst models provide a more intuitive and convenient approach for handling the types of uncertainties and the nuances that are characteristic of agent states and opinions in complex fusion environments and social networks @xcite .",
    "for example .",
    "complete ignorance can be captured via the ` vacuous ' model and lack of evidence can be captured by allowing evidential support for non - singleton propositions ( see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) . for the variety of data imperfection types that dst models can conveniently capture , see table  1 in @xcite .",
    "however , much of the work on opinion dynamics in social networks has focused on modeling the agent states as either scalar real numbers , or a vector of real numbers @xcite , e.g. , see the _ hegselmann - krause ( hk ) model _ @xcite and the _ deffuant - weisbuch ( dw ) model _ @xcite .    in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we utilized the dst framework to address consensus formation in asynchronous dynamic / ad - hoc networks with applications to high - level fusion networks , and opinion dynamics in social networks . by utilizing ds theory ,",
    "the methods by which an agent models an opinion and updates its opinion are now equipped with a powerful mechanism for grappling with the uncertainty inherent in the problem , whether in the form of vague agent opinions , or imprecise data in a fusion network ( e.g. , vague witness statements ) . in @xcite , we presented the foundations of analyzing opinion dynamics and revision of agent state beliefs in asynchronous dynamic / ad - hoc , demonstrating conditions under which consensus is achieved .",
    "our more recent work in @xcite utilized ideas from psychology , namely social judgment theory ( sjt ) @xcite , which examines the basic psychological processes underlying the expression of attitudes and their modifiability through communication . in particular , in @xcite , we specifically used the notion of _ bounded confidence _ which stems from the concept of _ latitude of acceptance _ in sjt . in a social network , agents may only communicate and exchange opinions with their neighbors who have similar opinions on a particular topic . in other words ,",
    "an agent may be willing to update its opinion with the neighboring agent s opinion only if the ` distance ' to that opinion is within a certain bound of confidence .",
    "the opinion exchange models in the hk and dw models account for these bounded confidence notions .",
    "the work in @xcite addresses statistical estimation of the bound of confidence . in @xcite agents are treated as bayesian decision - makers and bayes risk error has been used to estimate the bounds .",
    "the bounded confidence assumption is also useful within high - level fusion networks to capture situations where agents may only exchange evidence with agents that have states similar to their own and perhaps avoiding the use of faulty outlier sensors / agents .",
    "_ contributions .",
    "_ as in @xcite , this present work of ours on agent consensus formation in dynamic networks is formulated within the dst framework .",
    "this allows us to embrace a wider variety of uncertainties and nuances that are more representative of agent states / opinions in complex fusion networks and social networks .    taking this dst setting as a springboard , for the main contributions of this work , we focus on two special cases of dst agent opinion models , viz . , opinions modeled as a p.m.f . and a dirichlet body of evidence ( which allows one to retain ds theory s ability to capture complete ignorance with only a slight increase in computational complexity ) @xcite .",
    "utilizing results from matrix theory , graph theory , and networks , we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the conditions for consensus formation among a group of agents residing within a dynamic network ( i.e. , the network connectivity graph is dynamic , so that links can appear , or disappear , meaning that the agents may not have the same neighbors at each time instant ) . of particular value",
    "are the following :    ( 1 )  each agent may employ either _ cautious _ or _ receptive _ opinion update strategies , which essentially determines whether the agent acts as an opinion ` leader ' or an opinion ` follower . '",
    "( 2 )  the agents employ bounded confidence notions so that an agent exchanges and updates its state / opinion with only those neighbors whose opinions are similar ( as measured by a suitable norm ) to its own opinion .",
    "( 3 )  the notion of _ opinion dynamic chains _ and corresponding results being presented in this work capture network topologies , and conditions under which , where one or two groups of agents interact with another group of agents to drive them toward a consensus opinion or opinion clusters .",
    "( 4 )  focusing on the two cases of p.m.f . and dst dirichlet agent opinion models , the behavior of the network in the presence of multiple opinion leaders is explored .",
    "the analytical results require significantly less restrictive assumptions than those in @xcite , which , to the authors knowledge , is the only other work that deals with multiple opinion leaders .",
    "( 5 )  these general analytical results are then used to study how opinion leaders interact with opinion followers . in particular",
    ", it is shown that the arrival at a consensus opinion or opinion clusters is dependent on the the number of opinion leaders present and the agents bounds of confidence .",
    "( 6 )  several cases of interest in both opinion dynamics and fusion domains are studied .",
    "this includes the the _ leader - follower problem _ @xcite",
    "where a subset of the networked agents achieve an opinion cluster which is then followed and adopted by the remaining agents .    ( 7 )  finally , experimental evaluations are carried out to explore whether these results on p.m.f . and",
    "dirichlet agent opinions apply to and are valid for agent opinions represented via general dst models .",
    "as elaborated upon earlier , dst framework offers a more intuitive and convenient avenue to capture the types of uncertainties and the nuances associated with agent opinions . this current work and the results regarding p.m.f . and",
    "dirichlet agent opinions constitute an important step toward understanding how agents whose states / opinions are captured via more general dst models behave in terms consensus and opinion cluster formation .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : preliminaries ] covers basic background material .",
    "section  [ sec : ourmodel ] presents our opinion update model with the conditional update equation ( cue ) as the governing equation .",
    "our main theoretical contribution on opinion dynamic chains driven by one group ( _ 1-odc _ ) and opinion dynamic chains driven by two groups ( _ 2-odc _ ) are in section  [ sec : odc ] where we focus on two special cases of the dst agent opinion model : section  [ subsec : pmf ] deals with agent opinions captured via p.m.f.s which would appeal to readers with background knowledge in probabilistic opinion representation ; section  [ subsec : dirichletbba ] deals with dst dirichlet agent opinions . section  [ sec : results ] provides experimental validation of our results , including their applicability in scenarios where",

    "<S> the problem of analyzing the performance of networked agents exchanging evidence in a dynamic network has recently grown in importance . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has relevance in signal and data fusion network applications and in studying opinion and consensus dynamics in social networks . due to its capability of handling a wider variety of uncertainties and ambiguities associated with evidence , we use the framework of dempster - shafer ( ds ) theory to capture the opinion of an agent . </S>",
    "<S> we then examine the consensus among agents in dynamic networks in which an agent can utilize either a _ cautious _ or _ receptive _ updating strategy . in particular , we examine the case of _ bounded confidence updating _ where an agent exchanges its opinion only with neighboring nodes possessing ` similar ' evidence . in a fusion network , this captures the case in which nodes only update their state based on evidence consistent with the node s own evidence . in opinion dynamics , this captures the notions of social judgment theory ( sjt ) in which agents update their opinions only with other agents possessing opinions closer to their own . focusing on the two special ds theoretic cases where an agent state is modeled as a dirichlet body of evidence and a probability mass function ( p.m.f . ) , we utilize results from matrix theory , graph theory , and networks to prove the existence of consensus agent states in several time - varying network cases of interest . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we show the existence of a consensus in which a subset of network nodes achieves a consensus that is adopted by follower network nodes . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the case of multiple opinion leaders , where we show that the agents do not reach a consensus in general , but rather converge to ` opinion clusters ' . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results are provided to illustrate the main results .    </S>",
