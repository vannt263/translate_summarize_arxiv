    "it is now widely believed that neutrino oscillations are modified by matter effects , which is often referred to as the mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite . in this effect ,",
    "the coherent forward scattering in matter by charged currents results in phase shifts in neutrino oscillations . since ordinary matter consists of electrons , but no muons or taus , the @xmath3 boson exchange causes a relative phase shift of the electron neutrino flavor .",
    "this relative phase shift then translates into changes of the neutrino oscillation probabilities .    the establishment of the lma ( large mixing angle ) solution in solar neutrino oscillations by the combined knowledge from sno  @xcite , kamland  @xcite , and the other solar neutrino experiments has lead to `` indirect '' evidence for the msw effect within the sun",
    ". a more direct test of these matter effects would be the `` solar day - night effect '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , where the solar neutrino flux can ( during the night ) be enhanced through matter effects in the earth due to regeneration effects  @xcite .",
    "so far , the solar day - night effect has not been discovered at a high confidence level by super - kamiokande and sno solar neutrino measurements  @xcite .",
    "a future very large water cherenkov detector used for proton decay ( @xmath4 @xmath5 super - kamiokande ) could establish this effect at the @xmath6 confidence level within ten years  @xcite .",
    "similar tests could be performed with supernova neutrinos  @xcite , which , however , have a strong ( neutrino flux ) model , detector position(s ) , and @xmath7 dependence  @xcite . in addition , strong matter effects can also occur in atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the earth  @xcite .",
    "since the muon neutrino disappearance probability is , to first order in @xmath8 and @xmath9 , not affected by earth matter effects  @xcite , testing the matter effects in atmospheric neutrinos is very difficult .",
    "however , the appearance signal of future long - baseline experiments is supposed to be very sensitive towards matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations ( see , for example , refs .",
    "this makes the long - baseline test one natural candidate to directly discover the msw effect at a very high confidence level .",
    "since the direct verification of the msw effect would be another consistency check for our picture of neutrino oscillations , we study the potential of future long - baseline experiments to test matter versus vacuum oscillations .",
    "a similar measurement based upon matter effects in neutrino oscillations is the mass hierarchy sensitivity , which assumes that the matter effect is present and then tests the difference between the normal and inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "we will use this measurement in some cases for comparison in order to show the similarities and differences to the matter effect sensitivity . note that the direct test of the msw effect at neutrino factories was , for example , studied in ref .",
    "since at that time the parameter @xmath8 was very small for the lma best - fit values , the contributions from the solar terms in the appearance probability were neglected and the msw effect sensitivity was therefore determined to be strongly suppressed by @xmath0 . we will show that the now larger best - fit value of @xmath10 ( and thus @xmath11 ) does not justify this assumption anymore .",
    "for long - baseline beam experiments , the electron or muon neutrino appearance probability @xmath12 ( one of the probabilities @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) is very sensitive to matter effects , whereas the disappearance probability @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) is , to first order , not .",

    "the sign of the second term is positive for @xmath27 or @xmath28 and negative for @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the sign of @xmath31 is determined by the sign of @xmath32 and choosing neutrinos ( plus ) or antineutrinos ( minus ) .",
    "note that the matter effect in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) enters via the matter potential @xmath31 , where the equation reduces to the vacuum case for @xmath33 ( _ cf .",
    "_ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath34 has not yet been established , any suppression by @xmath0 would be a major disadvantage for a measurement .",
    "therefore , let us first investigate the interesting limit @xmath35 . in this limit , only the fourth term in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) survives , which is often referred to as the `` solar term '' , since the appearance signal in the limit @xmath36 corresponds to the contribution from the solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "it would vanish in the two - flavor limit ( limit @xmath37 ) and would grow proportional to @xmath38 in vacuum ( limit @xmath33 ) , as one expects from the solar neutrino contribution in the atmospheric limit . note that this term is equal for the normal and inverted mass hierarchies , which means that it can not be used for the mass hierarchy sensitivity . in order to show its effect for the matter effect sensitivity compared to vacuum , we use @xmath39 .",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) @xmath40 thus , this remaining effect does not depend on @xmath0 and strongly increases with the baseline .",

    "note that the argument @xmath45 evaluates to @xmath46 independent of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which means that it only depends on the baseline @xmath49 .",
    "this also implies that the msw effect in the limit @xmath36 actually modifies the solar oscillation frequency , because the argument @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : matter3 ] ) does not depend on @xmath48 .",
    "] in the earth , where eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) is valid because of the approximation @xmath50 , we therefore have @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the matter effects will suppress the appearance probability , where maximal suppression is obtained at the magic baseline . for short baselines ,",
    "the expansion in @xmath52 shows that @xmath53 strongly grows with the baseline , and for very long baselines , the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ equ : matter3 ] ) becomes close to @xmath54 , which means that @xmath55 compensated the @xmath56-dependence of the flux .",
    "thus , we expect to be able to test the matter effect even for vanishing @xmath7 if the baseline is long enough .",
    "there is , however , another important ingredient in these qualitative considerations : the statistics has to be good enough to detect the term suppressed by @xmath57 . for the current best - fit values",
    ", @xmath57 evaluates to @xmath58 .",
    "one can easily estimate that the statistics of superbeams will normally be too low to measure the solar term for this value of @xmath57 to a high accuracy : let us compare the first and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) , which are suppressed by @xmath0 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "if one assumes that the other factors in the first and fourth terms are of order unity ( at least for @xmath59 close to the first oscillation maximum ) , one can estimate for a specific experiment that the contribution from the @xmath57-term only becomes significant if the @xmath0-sensitivity limit of this experiment is much better than @xmath57 .",
    "this condition is , in general , not satisfied for the proposed superbeams and could only be circumvented by a very long baseline , where the probability difference in eq .",
    "( [ equ : matter3 ] ) grows @xmath60 .",
    "for example , the  superbeam in the simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite would only lead to about four events with almost no dependence on the matter effect for @xmath36 ( dominated by the intrinsic beam background ) . for neutrino factories , however , this order of @xmath57 should be accessible for long enough baselines .",
    "for example , for the neutrino factory  of ref .",
    "@xcite at a baseline of @xmath1 , we find for @xmath36 about 90 events in matter compared to 421 in vacuum .",
    "another interesting limit is the one of large values of @xmath0 , where the first term in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) dominates , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath61 , which is equivalent to @xmath62 .",
    "it is strongly enhanced close to the matter resonance , where the resonance condition is given by @xmath63 .",
    "this condition evaluates to a resonance energy of @xmath64 ( for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) in the earth s mantle , which is usually covered by a neutrino factory energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , neutrino factories are supposed to be very sensitive to matter effects , which are in this limit driven by the atmospheric @xmath48 .",
    "since the sign of @xmath31 depends on the mass hierarchy ( and using neutrino or antineutrinos ) , it leads to a strong enhancement ( + ) or suppression ( - ) of the appearance probability .",
    "one therefore expects a very good sensitivity to the mass hierarchy for large enough @xmath0 and long enough baselines .",
    "similarly , one would expect a very good sensitivity to the matter effect itself compared to the vacuum case , since the appearance probability in matter becomes for long baselines very different from the vacuum case  @xcite .",
    "however , at least in the limit of small @xmath52 or @xmath31 , the difference between the matter and vacuum probabilities is by about a factor of two smaller than the one between the normal and inverted hierarchy matter probabilities , since the vacuum probability lies in between the other two .",
    "one can easily understand this in terms of the matter potential which `` pulls '' the probabilities in two different directions apart from the vacuum case .",
    "in addition , it is well known that the correlation with @xmath67 highly affects the mass hierarchy sensitivity in large regions of the parameters space ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "similarly , one can expect this correlation will destroy the matter effect sensitivity , too .",
    "therefore , for large values of @xmath0 , it is natural to assume that the test of the matter effect will be harder than the one of the mass hierarchy .",
    "in general , we use a three - flavor analysis of neutrino oscillations , where we take into account statistics , systematics , correlations , and degeneracies  @xcite . the analysis is performed with the @xmath68 method using the globes software  @xcite .    for the sensitivity to the matter effect ,",
    "we test the hypothesis of vacuum oscillations , _ i.e. _ , we compute the simulated event rates for vacuum and a normal mass hierarchy .",
    "note that there is not a large dependence on the mass hierarchy in vacuum , though the event rates depend ( even in vacuum ) somewhat on the mass hierarchy by the third term in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) ( if one is far enough off the oscillation maximum ) .",
    "we then test this hypothesis of vacuum oscillations by switching on the ( constant ) matter density profile and fit the rates to the simulated ones using the @xmath68 method . in order to take into account correlations ,",
    "we marginalize over all the oscillation parameters and test both the normal and inverted hierarchies . as a result",
    ", we obtain the minimum @xmath68 for the given set of true oscillation parameters which best fit the vacuum case .    for the mass hierarchy sensitivity",
    ", we compute the simulated rate vector for the chosen mass hierarchy and fit it with the opposite sign of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , it is determined by the minimum @xmath68 at the @xmath69-degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "note that for neutrino factories this minimum at the opposite sign of @xmath48 might be very difficult to find because of mixed degeneracies . since we assume maximal mixing , the only relevant mixed degeneracy here is the @xmath70-degeneracy  @xcite for the inverted @xmath48 .",
    "the correlations originate in the minimization of the six - dimensional fit manifold at the position of the @xmath69-degeneracy , _ i.e. _ , any solution with the opposite sign of @xmath48 fitting the original solution destroys the mass hierarchy sensitivity  @xcite . in addition , we assume a constant matter density profile with 5% uncertainty , which takes into account matter density uncertainties as well as matter profile effects  @xcite .    for all measurements , we assume that each experiment will provide the best measurement of the leading atmospheric oscillation parameters at that time , _",
    "i.e. _ , we use the information from the disappearance channels simultaneously .",
    "however , we have tested for this study that the disappearance channels do not significantly contribute to the matter effect sensitivity . and large @xmath0 .",
    "however , in this region , the relative contribution of the disappearance @xmath68 to the total one is only at the percent level . ] furthermore , for the leading solar parameters , we take into account that the ongoing kamland experiment will improve the errors down to a level of about @xmath71 on each @xmath10 and @xmath72  @xcite .    as experiments , we will mainly use neutrino factories based upon the representative from ref .",
    "@xcite . in its standard configuration ,",
    "it uses muons with an energy of @xmath73 , @xmath74 target power ( @xmath75 useful muon decays per year ) , a baseline of @xmath76 , and a magnetized iron detector with a fiducial mass of @xmath77 .",
    "we choose a symmetric operation with @xmath78 in each polarity . for the oscillation parameters , we use ,",
    "if not stated otherwise , the current best - fit values @xmath66 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "we only allow values for @xmath0 below the chooz bound @xmath82  @xcite and do not make any special assumptions about @xmath67 .",
    "however , we will show in some cases the results for chosen selected values of @xmath67 .",
    "sensitivity to the msw effect for  as function of the true value of @xmath0 and the baseline @xmath49 . for the simulated oscillation parameters , the current best - fit values , @xmath83 , and a normal mass hierarchy are assumed , whereas the fit parameters are marginalized .",
    "sensitivity is given at the shown confidence level on the upper sides of the curves . ]",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : mswsens ] the sensitivity to the msw effect for as function of the true values of @xmath0 and the baseline @xmath49 , where @xmath83 and a normal mass hierarchy are assumed .",
    "the sensitivity is given above the curves at the shown confidence levels .",
    "obviously , the experiment can verify the msw effect for long enough baselines even for @xmath84 .",
    "the vertical dashed line separates the region where this measurement is dominated by the first term ( @xmath7-dominated ) and the fourth term ( solar - dominated ) in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) .",
    "it is drawn for @xmath85 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in this region all the terms of eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) have similar magnitudes . obviously , the performance in the @xmath7-dominated ( atmospheric oscillation - dominated ) regime is much better than the one in the solar - dominated regime , because the @xmath7-terms provide information on the matter effects in addition to the solar term . in this figure ,",
    "the curves are shown for different selected confidence levels . however , in order to really establish the effect , a minimum @xmath86 signal will be necessary .",
    "therefore , we will only use the @xmath86 curves below .    in order to discuss the most relevant parameter dependencies and to compare the matter effect and mass hierarchy sensitivities , we show in figure  [ fig : mswsign ] these sensitivities for two different values of @xmath67 .",
    "as we have tested , the true value of @xmath67 is one of the major impact factors for these measurements .",
    "in addition , the mass hierarchy sensitivity is modified by a similar amount for a simulated inverted instead of normal mass hierarchy , whereas the matter effect sensitivity does not show this dependence ( because the reference rate vector is computed for vacuum ) .",
    "as far as the dependence on @xmath10 is concerned , we have not found any signficant dependence of the msw effect sensitivity within the current allowed @xmath87 range @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "hence , we show in figure  [ fig : mswsign ] the selected two values of @xmath67 for estimates of the ( true ) parameter dependencies , since there are no major qualitative differences",
    ".        as one can see from this figure , the behavior of the msw sensitivity for short baselines and large @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to the one of the mass hierarchy sensitivity , because both measurements are dominated by the @xmath7-terms of eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) .",
    "however , as we have indicated in section  [ sec : analytical ] , the difference between the normal and inverted hierarchy matter rates is about a factor of two larger than the one between vacuum and matter rates ( for any mass hierarchy ) .",
    "thus , for large @xmath0 , the mass hierarchy sensitivity is better than the msw sensitivity ( better means that it works for shorter baselines ) .",
    "note that the solar ( fourth ) term in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) is not dependent on the mass hierarchy , which means that there is no mass hierarchy sensitivity for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "in general , there are three regions for the msw effect sensitivity in figure  [ fig : mswsign ] :    @xmath89 : : :    only the solar term in eq .",
    "( [ equ : probmatter ] ) is present .",
    "the msw    effect sensitivity therefore does not depend on    @xmath67 or the mass hierarchy . @xmath90 : : :    the measurement is dominated by the first term in    eq .  ( [ equ : probmatter ] ) with some contribution of the second and third    terms , which means that there is some dependence on    @xmath67 . @xmath91 : : :    in the intermediate region , these two effects are competing , which    leads to the `` bump '' in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mswsign ] . in    particular , the relative contribution of the cp terms in    eq .  ( [ equ : probmatter ] ) is quite large , which means that one expects    the strongest @xmath67-dependence there .    for the msw effect sensitivity , one can easily see from both panels of figure  [ fig : mswsign ] that for @xmath92 a baseline of @xmath76 would be sufficient , because in this case the @xmath7-signal is strong enough to provide information on the matter effects . however , in this case , @xmath0 will be discovered by a superbeam and it is unlikely that a neutrino factory will be built . for smaller values @xmath93 , longer baselines",
    "will be necessary .",
    "in particular , to have sensitivity to the matter effect independent of the true parameter values , a neutrino factory baseline @xmath94 is a prerequisite .",
    "therefore , this matter effect test is another nice argument for at least one very long neutrino factory baseline .",
    "note that one can read off the impact of correlations with the oscillation parameters from the comparison between the dashed and solid black curves in figure  [ fig : mswsign ] .",
    "if one just fixed all the oscillation parameters , one would obtain the dashed curves . in this case",
    ", one could come to the conclusion that a shorter baseline would be sufficient , which is not true for the complete marginalized analysis .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we have discussed in section  [ sec : analytical ] , the msw test is very difficult for superbeams . for the combination of , , and  from ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not even possible at the @xmath95 confidence level for @xmath96 at the chooz bound .",
    "however , for a very large superbeam upgrade at very long baselines , there would indeed be some sensitivity to the matter effect even for vanishing @xmath7 .",
    "for example , if one used the  setup from ref .",
    "@xcite and ( hypothetically ) put the detector to a longer baseline , one would have some matter effect sensitivity at the @xmath87 confidence level for selected baselines @xmath97 . for the `` magic baseline '' @xmath44 , one could even have a @xmath6 signal , but @xmath86 would hardly be possible .",
    "we have investigated the potential of long - baseline experiments to test the matter effect ( msw effect ) in neutrino oscillations .",
    "in particular , we have discussed under what conditions one can directly verify this msw effect compared to vacuum oscillations at a high confidence level .",
    "though it is generally known that beam experiments are , for sufficiently long baselines , very sensitive to matter effects , we have demonstrated that the @xmath7-terms in the appearance signal have much less matter effect sensitivity than one may expect .",
    "especially , the comparison with another matter effect - dominated measurement , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mass hierarchy sensitivity , has shown that the msw effect sensitivity is much weaker for short baselines @xmath98 .",
    "note that both of these measurements suffer from correlations and degeneracies especially for intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "however , for long enough baselines @xmath99 and good enough statistics , the solar term in the appearance probability is sensitive to matter effects compared to vacuum , which means that the msw effect sensitivity is not suppressed by @xmath0 anymore .",
    "note that the solar term is not sensitive to the mass hierarchy at all , but it is reduced in matter compared to vacuum . in summary , we have demonstrated that a neutrino factory with a sufficiently long baseline would have good enough statistics for a @xmath86 msw effect discovery independent of @xmath0 , where the solar term becomes indeed statistically accessible .",
    "however , a very long baseline superbeam upgrade , such as a -like experiment at the `` magic baseline '' @xmath100 , could have some sensitivity to the solar appearance term at the @xmath6 confidence level .",
    "this result has three major implications : first , it is another argument for at least one very long neutrino factory baseline , where the other purposes of such a baseline could be a `` clean '' ( correlation- and degeneracy - free ) @xmath0-measurement at the `` magic baseline ''  @xcite and a very good mass hierarchy sensitivity for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "the verification of the msw effect would be a little `` extra '' for such a baseline .",
    "in addition , note that the mass hierarchy sensitivity assumes that the matter effects are present , which means that some more evidence for the msw effect would increase the consistency of this picture .",
    "second , the absence of the @xmath0-suppression in the solar appearance term means that the direct msw test at a beam experiment could be competitive with others methods , for a summary , see table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "however , it could be also partly complementary : if @xmath0 turned out to be large , it is the atmospheric oscillation frequency which would be modified by matter effects and not the solar one .",
    "in addition , the msw effect in earth matter could be a more `` direct '' test under controllable conditions , because the earth s mantle has been extensively studied by seismic wave geophysics .",
    "note that for atmospheric neutrinos , this test is much harder , an example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "third , we have demonstrated that the solar term in the appearance probability can really provide statistically significant information , which may also be useful for other applications .",
    "for example , the dependence of the solar appearance term on @xmath101 instead of @xmath102 in the disappearance probability could , for properly chosen baselines , be useful to resolve the @xmath103-degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "thus , the formerly unwanted background term affecting any @xmath7 measurement could indeed be useful for other applications .",
