    "in recent years , renewable energy has gained much popularity and attention because of it s potential in economic and environmental advantages . some of the benefits include- high stainability , low carbon emission , reduction of environmental impact , saving fuel cost and so on .",
    "other advantages include economical benefits to remote communities and supporting the microgrids during the operation in islanded mode .",
    "although renewable energy , e.g. , wind and solar , offers huge benefits  @xcite , their practical use is limited due to their intermittent nature which makes it very challenging to ensure a steady power supply in the grid  @xcite . because of the variable nature of the renewable energy based power generation sources , transmission and distribution system operators need advanced monitoring and control .",
    "wind power generation relies on wind speed which varies depending on location and time . for economic and stable operation of the wind power plant ,",
    "accurate forecasting of wind power is critical .",
    "there are two main wind power forecasting approaches , physical method and statistical method . in the first approach",
    ", the physical system and power translation processes are modelled in detail . therefore , physical approaches not only need the information of historical wind speed data but also other information , i.e. , meteorological output , hub height of the turbine and physical modelling of power conversion process from wind speed are essential  @xcite . on the other hand , in a statistical approach ,",
    "wind power output is modelled as a time - series where the power output at any time instant depends on its previous observation values .",
    "the physical approach provides good accuracy for long term forecasting but not so good for short term forecasting as it is computationally very demanding . on the contrary ,",
    "statistical approaches are well suited for short therm forecasting .    for short term wind power forecasting , different approaches are well studied  @xcite . in a conventional statistical approach",
    ", wind power output behaviour is modelled as a time - series .",
    "autoregressive ( ar ) model has been used for wind energy forecasting in  @xcite and autoregressive moving average ( arma ) model has been used in  @xcite . the artificial neural network ( ann )",
    "is also widely used  @xcite . however , the ann based approaches has very slow convergence during the training phase  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "statistical regressive models are computationally very efficient and widely used for short term forecasting  @xcite .    in the statistical approaches ,",
    "the forecasting accuracy is highly dependent on the estimated model of the wind power output behaviour .",
    "therefore , it is important to identify the estimated model parameters accurately .",
    "different methods are widely used to estimate the ar model parameters , such as , ordinary least squares ( ls ) approach , forward backward ( fb ) approach , geometric lattice ( gl ) approach and yule - walker ( yw ) approach , etc  @xcite .",
    "as the wind power output has variable characteristics , the error function obtained from the estimated model may have many local minima .",
    "for short - term load forecasting , it has been shown that the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) , one of the major paradigms of the computational swarm intelligence , converges to the global optimal solution of a complex error surface and finds better solution compared with gradient search based stochastic time - series techniques  @xcite .",
    "previously , pso has been widely used in different applications of power system  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a modified variant of pso based on constriction factor ( cf ) is employed to identify the ar parameters more accurately .",
    "the proposed cf - pso based identified ar parameters have better error minimization profiles compared to the well - established ls , fb , gl and yw based approaches .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows- the formulation of basic pso and cf - pso is discussed in section  [ psos ] .",
    "autoregressive model order selection and parameter estimation methodology is described in section  [ armodel ] .",
    "the proposed ar parameter estimation method based on cf - pso is illustrated in section  [ psomodel ] . in section  [ rnd ] , results obtained from this experiment are given and compared with four standard techniques . finally , the paper concludes with some brief remarks in section  [ secend ] .",
    "pso is a multi - objective optimization technique which finds the global optimum solution by searching iteratively in a large space of candidate solutions .",
    "the description of basic pso and cf - pso formulation is discussed in the following subsections :      this meta - heuristic is initialized by generating random population which is referred as a swarm .",
    "the dimension of the swarm depends on the problem size . in a swarm ,",
    "each individual possible solution is represented as a ` particle ' . at each iteration",
    ", positions and velocities of particles are updated depending on their individual and collective behavior .",
    "generally , objective functions are formulated for solving minimization problems ; however , the duality principle can be used to search the maximum value of the objective function  @xcite . at the first step of the optimization process , an _",
    "n_-dimensional initial population ( swarm ) and control parameters are initialized .",
    "each particle of a swarm is associated with the position vector and the velocity vector , which can be written as + velocity vector , @xmath0 $ ] and    position vector , @xmath1 $ ] + where n represents the search space dimension . before going to the basic pso loop ,",
    "the position and velocity of each particle is initialized .",
    "generally , the initial position of the @xmath2 particle @xmath3 can be obtained from uniformly distributed random vector u ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents the lower and upper limits of the solution space respectively .    during the optimization procedure ,",
    "position of each particle is updated using  ( [ peq ] ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "+ at each iteration , new velocity for each particle is updated which drives the optimization process .",
    "the new velocity of any particle is calculated based on its previous velocity , the particle s best known position and the swarm s best known position .",
    "particle s best known position is it s location at which the best fitness value so far has been achieved by itself and swarm s best known position is the location at which the best fitness value so far has been achieved by any particle of the entire swarm  @xcite .",
    "the velocity equation drives the optimization process which is updated using  ( [ veq ] )    @xmath10    in this equation , _ w _ is the inertia weight .",
    "@xmath11 represents the ` self influence ' of each particle which quantifies the performance of each particle with it s previous performances .",
    "the component @xmath12 represents the ` social cognition ' among different particles within a swarm and quantify the performance relative to other neighboring particles .",
    "the learning co - efficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the trade - off between the self influence part and the social cognition part of the particles  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are adopted from previous research and is typically set to 2  @xcite . in eqn  ( [ veq ] ) , @xmath15 is particle s best known position and @xmath16 is swarm s best known position .    in the solution loop of pso , the algorithm continues to run iteratively , until one of the following stopping conditions is satisfied  @xcite .    1 .",
    "number of iterations reach the maximum limit , e.g. , 100 iterations .",
    "no improvement is observed over a number of iterations , e.g. , error less than @xmath17  =  0.001      to achieve better stability and convergent behavior of pso , a constriction factor has been introduced by clerc and kennedy in  @xcite . the superiority of cf - pso over inertia - weight pso is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "basically , the search procedure of cf - pso is improved using the eigenvalue analysis and the system behavior can be controlled which ensures a convergent and efficient search procedure  @xcite . to formulate cf - pso , ( [ veq ] )",
