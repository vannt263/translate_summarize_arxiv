    "the recent discovery of highly deformed shapes and superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands in the n = z nuclei @xmath1ar  @xcite , @xmath2ca  @xcite , @xmath3cr  @xcite and @xmath4ni  @xcite has renewed the interest in theoretical calculations for _ sd_-shell nuclei around @xmath2ca  @xcite .",
    "therefore the a@xmath12 @xmath13 30 - 60 mass region becomes of particular interest  @xcite since quasimolecular resonances have also been observed for these @xmath0-like nuclei , in particular , in the @xmath9si+@xmath9si reaction  @xcite .",
    "although there is no experimental evidence to link the sd bands with the higher lying rotational bands formed by known quasimolecular resonances  @xcite , both phenomena are believed to originate from highly deformed configurations of these systems .",
    "the interpretation of resonant structures observed in the excitation functions in various combinations of light @xmath0-cluster nuclei in the energy regime from the barrier up to regions with excitation energies of 30 - 50  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate .",
    "in particular , in collisions between two @xmath14 nuclei , these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite . however , in many cases these structures have been connected to strongly deformed shapes and to the alpha - clustering phenomena  @xcite .",
    "there has been a continuing discussion as to whether these molecular resonances represent true cluster states in the @xmath8 mg compound system , or whether they simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential . in this paper , a few examples will be given showing the close connection between molecular resonance phenomena , alpha - clustering , and nuclear deformation .",
    "r[0cm]8 cm     the molecule - like sequences of resonances observed in @xmath9si + @xmath9si with measured angular momenta up to l = 42@xmath15 represented some nuclear excitations with the highest spins ever observed  @xcite . in the number of open channels",
    "model  @xcite , highly successful in selecting the systems showing resonance behavior , the main condition for observing a resonance behavior is associated with surface transparency .",
    "the @xmath9si + @xmath9si reaction is a particularly favorable case  @xcite , where the corresponding optical model ( om ) potentials have small imaginary components at distances corresponding to peripheral collisions .",
    "therefore , the well established j@xmath10",
    "= 38@xmath11 molecular resonance observed in @xmath9si + @xmath9si data at e@xmath16 = 112  mev has been studied at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires by both fragment - fragment and fragment - fragment-@xmath5 coincidence measurements  @xcite .",
    "a subsequent experiment  @xcite using charged particle spectroscopy techniques with the icare multidetector array  @xcite has indicated the occurence of strongly deformed shapes at high spin ( with axis ratios consistent with sd bands ) for the @xmath4ni composite system at the resonant energy in agreement with very recent @xmath5-ray spectroscopy data obtained at much lower spins  @xcite . from the analysis of the particle angular distributions of the mass - symmetric @xmath9si + @xmath9si exit - channel  @xcite , it could be concluded that , at the resonance energy , the spin vectors of the @xmath9si fragments do not couple with the orbital angular momentum , leading to @xmath17 . the fragment - fragment-@xmath5 coincidence data",
    "@xcite demonstrate that for the @xmath9si fragments , the mutually excited states are the most strongly populated .",
    "the resonance behavior appears to involve preferentially the low - lying states of the mass - symmetric channel .    in fig .",
    "1 the results of the @xmath5-ray angular correlations for the mutual excitation exit - channel ( 2@xmath18,2@xmath18 ) are shown .",
    "the distributions are presented in terms of the polar angles with respect to the three different quantization axes defined as :  ( a ) the beam axis , ( b ) the axis normal to the scattering plane , and ( c ) the axis perpendicular to both axes defined in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the ( c ) axis corresponds approximately to the molecular axis of the outgoing binary fragments .",
    "the strong minimum in fig .",
    "1(b ) at 90@xmath19 implies that the magnetic substate m is equal to zero ( @xmath17 ) , and , thus , that the intrinsic spin vectors of the 2@xmath11 states are oriented in the reaction plane perpendicularly to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the value of the total angular momentum , therefore , remains close to @xmath20 , in good agreement with the angular distributions results  @xcite .",
    "these observations do favor the calculations of the molecular model of uegaki and abe  @xcite , which predict a vanishing spin alignment for @xmath9si + @xmath9si arising from a butterfly mode of vibration of the di - nuclear system at the resonance energy .",
    "the present @xmath9si + @xmath9si data show , for the first time in a heavy - ion collision , a vanishing spin alignment . therefore , the comparison between the three symmetric systems @xmath6c + @xmath6c , @xmath8 mg + @xmath8 mg and @xmath9si + @xmath9si in fig .",
    "2 shows an interesting contrast in the spin orientation at resonance energies .",
    "r[0cm]8 cm     the results indicate that the @xmath9si + @xmath9si oblate - oblate system , illustrated by fig .",
    "2(b ) , is characterised by spin disalignment in contrast to the spin alignment observed for both the @xmath6c + @xmath6c system  @xcite of fig .",
    "2(c ) ( oblate - oblate ) and the @xmath8 mg + @xmath8 mg system  @xcite of fig",
    ".  2(a ) ( prolate - prolate ) .",
    "molecular - model calculations  @xcite are capable to explain the vanishing spin alignment in the oblate - oblate @xmath9si + @xmath9si system  @xcite , where both nuclear spin vectors are perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum lying in the reaction plane .    a new butterfly mode of vibration for the @xmath9si-@xmath9si triaxial molecule can then be speculated . however , the question of why the spin orientations in the two oblate - oblate systems @xmath9si + @xmath9si and @xmath6c + @xmath6c are so different is still unclear .",
    "differences in the interactions between the constituent nuclei may play a key role .",
    "for example , there is a remarkable difference in the available molecular configurations in the excitation spectra of the @xmath6c and @xmath9si nuclei . in @xmath6c",
    "+ @xmath6c there are few molecular configurations , located at the energies associated with the observed resonances , while in @xmath9si + @xmath9si there are many more configurations .",
    "it is possible that the large number of available configurations  @xcite allows for the formation of coherent or collective states .",
    "this explains the sharp resonances which decay into many inelastic channels . in the @xmath6c + @xmath6c system",
    ", such coherent effects may not be allowed to develop . in this case",
    "the individual configurations may be observed .",
    "overall , the results of these experiments provide further support for recent theoretical investigations that view the resonances in terms of shape - isomeric states stabilized in hyperdeformed secondary minima  @xcite",
    ". however , a more global understanding will surely require a more fundamental synthesis of the theories which describe reaction mechanisms with those describing nuclear structure at high excitation energy and angular momentum .",
    "in the framework of the search for nuclear molecules the most spectacular results have often been obtained for the @xmath6c+@xmath6c reaction  @xcite . however",
    ", the question whether @xmath6c+@xmath6c molecular resonances represent true cluster states in the @xmath8 mg compound system , or whether they simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential is still unresolved  @xcite . in many cases these structures",
    "have been connected to strongly deformed shapes and to the alpha - clustering phenomena , predicted from the @xmath0-cluster model  @xcite , hartree - fock calculations  @xcite , the nilsson - strutinsky approach  @xcite .",
    "various decay branches from the highly excited @xmath8mg@xmath21 nucleus , including the emission of @xmath0 particles or heavier fragments such as @xmath22be and @xmath6c , are possibly available .",
    "however , @xmath5-decays have not been observed so far . actually the @xmath5-ray branches are predicted to be rather small at these excitation energies ,",
    "although some experiments have been reported  @xcite , which have searched for these very small branches expected in the range of 10@xmath23 - 10@xmath24 fractions of the total width  @xcite .",
    "the rotational bands built on the knowledge of the measured spins and excitation energies can be extended to rather small angular momenta , where finally the @xmath5-decay becomes a larger part of the total width .",
    "the population of such states in @xmath0-cluster nuclei , which are lying below the threshold for fission decays and for other particle decays , is favored in binary reactions , where at a fixed incident energy the composite nucleus is formed with an excitation energy range governed by the two - body reaction kinematics .",
    "these states may be coupled to intrinsic states of @xmath8mg@xmath25 as populated by a breakup process ( via resonances ) as shown in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8mg+@xmath6c reaction has been extensively investigated by several measurements of the @xmath6c(@xmath8mg,@xmath6c@xmath6c)@xmath6c breakup channel  @xcite .",
    "sequential breakups are found to occur from specific states in @xmath8 mg at excitation energies ranging from 20 to 35 mev , which are linked to the ground state and also have an appreciable overlap with the @xmath6c+@xmath6c quasi - molecular configuration .",
    "several attempts @xcite were made to link the @xmath6c+@xmath6c barrier resonances @xcite with the breakup states .",
    "the underlying reaction mechanism is now fairly well established  @xcite and many of the barrier resonances appear to be correlated indicating that a common structure may exist in both instances .",
    "this is another indication of the possible link between barrier resonances and secondary minima in the compound nucleus .",
    "the study of particle-@xmath5 coincidences in binary reactions in reverse kinematics is probably a unique tool for the search for extreme shapes related to clustering . in this way the @xmath8mg+@xmath6c reaction has been investigated with high selectivity at e@xmath16(@xmath8 mg ) = 130 mev with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) in coincidence with euroball iv installed at the vivitron  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the @xmath26 reaction implies that for an incident energy of e@xmath16 = 130  mev an excitation energy range up to e@xmath25 = 30  mev in @xmath8 mg is covered  @xcite .",
    "the brs gives access to a novel approach to the study of nuclei at large deformations  @xcite .",
    "the excellent channel selection capability of binary and/or ternary fragments gives a powerful identification among the reaction channels , implying that euroball iv is used mostly with one or two - fold multiplicities , for which the total @xmath5-ray efficiency is very high .",
    "the brs trigger consists of a kinematical coincidence set - up combining two large - area heavy - ion telescopes .",
    "both detector telescopes comprise each a two - dimensional position sensitive low - pressure multiwire chamber in conjunction with a bragg - curve ionization chamber .",
    "all detection planes are four - fold subdivided in order to improve the resolution and to increase the counting rate capability ( 100 k - events / s ) . the two - body q - value has been reconstructed using events for which both fragments are in well selected states chosen for spectroscopy purposes as well as to determine the reaction mechanism responsible for the population of these peculiar states .",
    "the inverse kinematics of the @xmath8mg+@xmath6c reaction and the negative q - values give ideal conditions for the trigger on the brs , because the chosen angular range is optimum and because the solid angle transformation gives a factor  10 for the detection of the heavy fragments .",
    "thus we have been able to cover a large part of the angular distribution of the binary process with high efficiency , and a selection of events in particular angular ranges has been achieved . in binary exit - channels",
    "the exclusive detection of both ejectiles allows precise q - value determination , z - resolution and simultaneously optimal doppler - shift correction .",

    "all known transitions of @xmath8 mg  @xcite can be identified in the energy range depicted .",
    "as expected we see decays feeding the yrast line of @xmath8 mg up to the 8@xmath27 level .",
    "the population of some of the observed states , in particular , the 2@xmath11 , 3@xmath11 and 4@xmath11 members of the k@xmath10 = 2@xmath11 rotational band , appears to be selectively enhanced .",
    "the strong population of the k@xmath10 = 2@xmath11 band and his 4@xmath11 member at e@xmath28 = 6.01 mev has also been observed in the @xmath6c(@xmath6c,@xmath5 ) radiative capture reaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is an indication of a @xmath5-ray around 5.95 mev which may be identified with the 10@xmath29 @xmath30 8@xmath27 transition as proposed in ref .",
    "it has been checked in the @xmath5-@xmath5 coincidences that most of the states of fig .",
    "3 belong to cascades which contain the characteristic 1368 kev @xmath5-ray and pass through the lowest 2@xmath11 state in @xmath8 mg .",
    "still a number of transitions in the high - energy part of the spectrum ( 6 - 8  mev ) have not been clearly identified . even at higher energies , @xmath8 mg states appear to show up around 10  mev ( not shown ) with very poor statistics and of unknown structure .",
    "similar states were also observed in the radiative capture reaction  @xcite .",
    "their occurence may be in qualitative agreement with a decay scenario of radiative capture states proposed by baye and descouvemont  @xcite in the framework of a microscopic study of the @xmath6c+@xmath6c system with the coordinate generator method .",
    "the reason why the search for a @xmath5-decay in @xmath6c+@xmath6c has not been conclusive so far  @xcite is due to the excitation energy in @xmath8 mg as well as the spin region ( 8@xmath15 - 12@xmath15 ) which were chosen too high",
    ". the next step of the analysis will be the use of the brs trigger in order to select the excitation energy range by the two - body q - value ( in the @xmath6c+@xmath8 mg channel ) , and thus we will be able to study the region around the decay barriers , where @xmath5-decay becomes observable . according to recent predictions @xmath5-rays from 6@xmath11 @xmath30 4@xmath11 should have measurable branching ratios .",
    "work is currently in progress to analyse the @xmath5 rays from the @xmath6c(@xmath8mg,@xmath6c @xmath6c)@xmath6c ternary breakup reaction .",
    "we have discussed the possible link between resonant states in collisions with identical bosons such as @xmath6c+@xmath6c , @xmath8mg+@xmath8 mg and @xmath9si+@xmath9si and the sd bands recently discovered in light n = z nuclei such as @xmath1ar , @xmath2ca , @xmath3cr , and @xmath4ni . a new butterfly mode of vibration of the well established j@xmath10 = 38@xmath11 resonance of the @xmath9si-@xmath9si triaxial molecule has been discovered experimentally .",
    "the connection of alpha - clustering and quasimolecular resonances has been discussed with the search for the @xmath6c+@xmath6c molecule populated by the @xmath8mg+@xmath6c breakup reaction .",
    "the most spectacular result is the strong population of the k@xmath10 = 2@xmath11 band of the @xmath8 mg nucleus that has also been observed in an exploratory investigation of the @xmath6c(@xmath6c,@xmath5 ) radiative capture reaction  @xcite .",
    "subsequent radiative capture experiments are planned in the near future with highly efficient spectrometers ( the dragon separator at triumf and the fma at argonne ) to investigate the overlap of @xmath8 mg states observed in the present work with radiative capture states .",
    "as far as the @xmath5-ray spectroscopy is concerned , the coexistence of @xmath0-cluster states and sd states predicted in @xmath31s by recent antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations  @xcite is still an experimental challenge .",
    "this kind of experiments designed to measure very small @xmath32@xmath33/@xmath32@xmath34 branching ratios is extremely difficult since it requires not only high - efficient fragment detection in conjunction with a high - resolution ge multidetector such as the gammasphere and euroball 4@xmath35 @xmath5 arrays but also a large amount of beam time .",
