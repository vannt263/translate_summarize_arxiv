    "two - dimensional version of a fermi accelerator , consisting of a free particle in a circular trap with a radius varying periodically in time , has been extensively studied in classical and quantum mechanics @xcite .    it has been noted by godoy and okamura @xcite that particles motion in a nanoscopic circuit can be regarded as a quantum wave , moving inside a wave guide filled with a scattering medium , and transient currents in these circuits can be produced by rapidly removing ( or adding ) boundary walls to the guide .",
