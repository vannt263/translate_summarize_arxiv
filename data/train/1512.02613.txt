    "since its discovery , graphene has been the subject of considerable research @xcite , including the propagation of electrons through multilayer systems @xcite .",
    "akin to monolayer graphene , gbg has become a very interesting research material @xcite . in particular , at low energies , the properties of gbg are described by massive chiral quasiparticles that obey a quadratic dispersion relation .",
    "this opens an important door to the path of electronics because bilayer graphene is intrinsically an undoped gapless semiconductor @xcite , and both the carrier density and the energy bandgap can be controlled by doping or gating @xcite .",
    "+ one of the most remarkable differences of gapless bilayer graphene as compared with gapless monolayer graphene is that propagating and evanescent states coexist inherently in this material , giving rise to quite interesting and exotic phenomena such as anti - klein tunneling @xcite and fano resonances @xcite .",
    "the case of fano resonances in gbg is unique , since in practically all material systems in which this phenomenon is manifested an external source that provides extended states is required @xcite .",
    "this dichotomy , the propagating and evanescent character , of dirac electrons in gbg turns out in an asymmetric line shape of the transmission probability , when the material is subjected to an electrostatic barrier .",
    "even , the signatures of the fano resonances can be manifested in the transport properties of gbg , opening the possibility of testing this quite exotic phenomenon in conductance measurements .",
    "even more , fano resonances are appealing from the technological standpoint , since their asymmetric line shape gives the possibility of modulate the transmission properties from a negligible value to a high value in a very narrow energy or frequency range .",
    "this makes gbg an excellent candidate for electronics applications as sensors , lasing and nonlinear devices @xcite .",
    "+ from the formal point of view the coefficient transfer matrix method ( @xmath1 ) is suitable to study charge transport properties ( e.g. , transmission coefficients , conductance , etc . ) in bilayer graphene based electrostatic single and multi - barrier systems @xcite .",
    "this method is so popular due to its simplicity as well as its adaptability to a wide range of wave - propagation phenomena .",
    "however , the practical application of this matrix method in gbg superlattices is hampered by a numerical degradation , the so called : the @xmath3 problem @xcite .",
    "the name associated with this numerical instability derives from the elastic waves studies where this instability is present at high frequencies @xmath0 and/or big thicknesses ( @xmath4 ) of the structure layers .",
    "this is because the matrix elements contain a mixture of exponentially growing and decaying terms that lead to loss of precision during computations @xcite . in gbg this mixture is given by the presence of evanescent - divergent states in the eigenfunctions linear superposition representing the dirac spinors . due to the peculiarities presented in this material @xcite",
    "the @xmath3 problem is more likely in gbg superlattice studies where parameters such as the energy and angle of the incidence electrons as well as the thickness and number of barriers is increased . likewise , in aperiodic or quasi - periodic structures this numerical degradation is natural , since the size of these structures increases as a function of the generation number @xcite .",
    "+ different techniques have been proposed to avoid the @xmath3 problem .",
    "some of them , as the global transfer matrix involve matrices with dimensions increasing with the number of layers forming the system .",
    "other approaches employ transfer matrices with dimensions independent of the number of layers . among them",
    "we can find the scattering matrix method , the impedance matrix method , the compound matrix , and the hybrid compliance - stiffness matrix or simply the hybrid matrix @xcite .",
    "from all these possibilities , the hybrid matrix method is an excellent option , since it is numerically stable , well - conditioned , and accurate irrespective of the thickness ( large , small or even zero ) of the system @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we study transmission properties of electrons in gbg superlattice using the transfer matrix method . we show that the practical application of the common coefficient transfer matrix @xmath5 may leads to numerical instabilities ( the @xmath3 problem ) when the electron energy , the angle of incidence , the height of the barriers and/or the size of the structures grows . to overcome this numerical problem we resorted to the hybrid matrix method using the straightforward methodology addressed in @xcite . to this end",
    "we transform the effective hamiltonian describing the motion of charge carriers in bilayer graphene into an ordinary second order differential system that take the sturm - liouville form @xcite .",
    "our results show that the hybrid matrix method gives reliable outputs for transmission properties of electrons in gbg superlattice , irrespective of the system size .",
    "our basic system is a graphene - based device , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this consists of two graphene sheets sited on a non - breaking symmetry substrate like @xmath6 .",
    "a back gate ( bg ) controls the fermi energy of dirac electrons and a top gate ( tg ) suspended at a certain distance from the bilayer graphene controls the width ( db ) and the height @xmath7 of the electrostatic barrier .",
    "two conducting leads are attached at right and left ends of the bilayer graphene structure .",

    "we can easily calculate the transmittance @xmath58 through the equation : @xmath59 as can be seen , the transmittance can be calculated using only 4 of the 16 matrix elements of the coefficient transfer matrix @xmath5 .",
    "+ at this point we draw attention to the value of the determinant of the matrix @xmath1 expressed in ( [ matrix - k ] ) . considering ( [ matrix - p ] ) it can be checked directly from ( [ matrix - k ] ) that the determinant of the matrix @xmath1 is one . in the analysis of our results we used the value of this determinant to check the numerical accuracy of our calculations . when the numerical instability is present the determinant takes values quite different from exactly one , being in some cases several orders of magnitude bigger or smaller than 1.0 .",

    "<S> gapless bilayer graphene ( gbg ) , like monolayer graphene , is a material system with unique properties , such as anti - klein tunneling and intrinsic fano resonances . </S>",
    "<S> these properties rely on the gapless parabolic dispersion relation and the chiral nature of bilayer graphene electrons . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , propagating and evanescent electron states coexist inherently in this material , giving rise to these exotic properties . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> bilayer graphene is unique , since in most material systems in which fano resonance phenomena are manifested an external source that provides extended states is required . </S>",
    "<S> however , from a numerical standpoint , the presence of evanescent - divergent states in the eigenfunctions linear superposition representing the dirac spinors , leads to a numerical degradation ( the so called @xmath0d problem ) in the practical applications of the standard coefficient transfer matrix ( @xmath1 ) method used to study charge transport properties in bilayer graphen based multi - barrier systems . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a straightforward procedure based in the hybrid compliance - stiffness matrix method ( @xmath2 ) that can overcome this numerical degradation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that in contrast to standard matrix method , the proposed @xmath2 method is suitable to study the transmission and transport properties of electrons in gbg superlattice since it remains numerically stable regardless the size of the superlattice and the range of values taken by the input parameters : the energy and angle of the incident electrons , the barrier height and the thickness and number of barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the matrix determinant can be used as a test of the numerical accuracy in real calculations .    </S>",
