    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) , though not statistical mechanical theory , is available to simulate electrolyte solutions . compared to classic molecular simulations with empirical model force - fields ,",
    "aimd calculations are severely limited in space and time scales , by more than an order - of - magnitude in each .",
    "consequently , application of aimd is not feasible for edlcs at scales that are experimentally interesting .",
    "this calls for further theory to embed aimd methods in studies of edcls .",
    "change - of - scale consequences are a primitive goal of fundamental statistical mechanical theory . that basic perspective is explicit in the classic phase transition literature,@xcite and it has long been relevant to the theory of electrolyte solutions specifically.@xcite this paper organizes several basic results of the statistical mechanics of solutions to treat electrolyte solutions where space and time scales will otherwise prohibit direct aimd calculations .",
    "our results here suggest a role for aimd somewhat analogous to sub - grid modeling in computational fluid mechanics . nevertheless , the goals of the statistical thermodynamics of complex solutions are distinct , and we do not propose transfer of results here between those fields .",
    "our development here utilizes several theoretical results that are ``  both difficult and strongly established  '' @xcite we put burdensome technical results in appendices , and in this introduction give a fuller discussion of the line of reasoning .    the initial step in our development",
    "is the mcmillan - mayer ( mm ) theory@xcite _ integrating out _ of solvent degrees of freedom .",
    "mm theory is a pinnacle of coarse - graining for the statistical mechanics of solutions , all primitive models rest on it , and it achieves a vast conceptual simplification the theory of electrolyte solutions .",
    "no sacrifice of molecular realism is implied by mm theory . but",
    "cataloging the multi - body potentials required for a literal mm application is prohibitive.@xcite therefore , use of mm theory to construct a specific primitive model for a system of experimental interest has been limited.@xcite indeed , the mm theory is not generally suitable for specific molecular - scale implementation .    to address this we exploit _ quasi - chemical theory _ ( qct ) which is formally complete in its modern expression.@xcite qct evaluates solvation free energies by breaking them into contributions with clear physical meanings .",
    "one contribution is a _ packing _ contribution .",
    "this can be simple in the anticipated applications because the solvent is not involved specifically , and the ion concentrations are not prohibitively high . a second contribution",
    " the _ outer shell _ contribution  treats ion - ion interactions at long - range and it is expected on physical grounds that the necessary mm interactions should be simple then . that outer - shell contribution is studied below .    the final contribution",
    " the _ chemical _ contribution  treats ion - ion inner - shell neighbors .",
    "smaller spatial scales must be directly confronted and it is here that the sub - grid aimd activity comes into play .",
    "[ fig : qct ] shows a now - standard picture of this organization of the statistical thermodynamical problem .",
    "this discussion suggests that van  der  waals theory is a subset of the present qct approach .",
    "this is advantageous because van  der  waals theory is the basis of the theory of liquids viewed broadly.@xcite while paying an unavoidable price of significant computational effort , qct goes beyond van  der  waals theory in several ways . for example here , where ion - pairing is an essential part of the physical picture , associative phenomena are treated fully .",
    "furthermore , our qct implementation would routinely treat outer - shell interactions through gaussian order rather than the mean - field approach of classic van  der  waals theories .",
    "this is essential in the present applications in order to capture the physical effect of debye screening of ion correlations .",
    "it is an interesting physical point that the identification of _ packing _ and _ chemical _ contributions here is a consequence of a choice of conditioning event , in the present development the emptiness of the inner - shell .",
    "this has the advantages that the theory is a close relative of van der waals theory , and that the outer - shell contribution should be particularly simple to evaluate .",
    "but other choices of conditioning event are possible too.@xcite for example , the conditioning event might be the event that the occupancy of the inner - shell is the value most probably observed .",
    "this has the intuitive attraction of being close to simple observations .",
    "but it presents the challenge that the evaluation of the partition function for that case might be more difficult . in what follows ,",
    "our primary emphasis is to characterize the computational effort to evaluate the partition function associated with _",
    "outer - shell _ contribution that arises with the original suggestion for the conditioning event .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : btr ] records several theoretical specifics that are required for our argument .",
    "the appendix a gives an accessible derivation of the mm theory results used here ; appendices b and c present technical features of the potential distribution theory and quasi - chemical theory , respectively , required in the main text .",

    "if the species considered are ions in solution , then we need to characterize ion neighbors of each ion in solution , distinguished in turn .",
    "pairing of oppositely charged ions has been the subject of classic scientific history@xcite that can inform the present discussion .",
    "pairing of tetra - fluoroborate 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium in pentanol has recently been studied both experimentally and computationally.@xcite    pairing of tetra - ethylammonium tetra - fluoroborate in propylene carbonate is a helpful example.@xcite in that case , pairing is simple to observe for saturated solution conditions and formation of chains and rings of ions is consistent with the molecular - scale observations .",
    "we might consider an indicator function @xmath14 with the requirement that @xmath15 indicates _ no _ b ions are within an inner - shell stencil of a distinguished a ion .",
    "the simplest possibility , natural for compact molecular ions , is to identify a central atom in a and in b ions , and to set @xmath15 ( but zero otherwise ) , when those atoms of further apart than a designated distance @xmath16 .",
