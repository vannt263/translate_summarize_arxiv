    "the `` siteswap '' theory of juggling patterns was invented in the early - mid 80s by paul klimek of santa cruz , bruce tiemann and bengt magnusson at caltech , and mike day and colin wright in oxford . in 1988 , having had some time to digest this theory , jack boyce and i ( each also at caltech ) independently invented a directed graph of `` juggling states '' to study siteswaps .",
    "we recall this definition now .",
    "fix @xmath3 for the rest of the paper ; it is called the * number of balls*. ( of course one might want a theory in which @xmath0 varies , but we wo nt vary it in this paper . ) a * juggling state * @xmath4 is just a @xmath0-element subset of @xmath5 , but we will draw it as a semi - infinite word in @xmath6 and @xmath7 using only @xmath0 many @xmath6s , e.g. @xmath8 . we wo nt generally write any of the infinitely many @xmath7s after the last @xmath6 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath4 is as follows : if a juggler is making one throw each second , and we stop them mid - juggle and let the @xmath0 balls fall to the ground , @xmath4 records the sound `` wait , thump , thump , wait , wait , thump '' ( and thereafter , silence ) that the balls make . in the standard `` cascade '' pattern ( @xmath0 odd ) and",
    "asynchronous `` fountain '' pattern ( @xmath0 even ) , this state is always the * ground state * @xmath9 , but other patterns go through more interesting states",
    ".- ball `` shower '' ( juggling in a circle ) alternates between the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ]",
    "put a directed edge @xmath12 if @xmath13 ( meaning , containment of the @xmath6-locations ) .",
    "if the first letter of @xmath4 is @xmath6 , then there is one extra @xmath6 in @xmath14 not in @xmath4 , in some position @xmath15 ; call @xmath16 the * throw * and label the edge with it . if the first letter of @xmath4 is @xmath7 , the throw is conventionally taken to be @xmath2 ( even though it s not much of a throw ; the juggler just waits for one beat ) . if @xmath12 , then any two of @xmath17 determine the third .",
    "a closed walk in this digraph is called a * juggling pattern * and is determined by its sequence of throws , the * siteswap*. here is the ( excellent ) siteswap @xmath18 as a closed walk : @xmath19 perhaps the earliest nontrivial theorem about siteswaps is ron et al.s calculation that the number of patterns of length @xmath20 with at most @xmath0 balls is @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "ron and his coauthors have also counted cycles that start from a given state @xcite .",
    "the first book on the general subject is @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "was studied the finite subgraph in which only throws of height @xmath22 are allowed , giving @xmath23 states .",
    "this digraph for @xmath24 , with arrows reversed , is isomorphic to the one for @xmath25 : we reverse the length-@xmath20 states , and switch @xmath6s and @xmath7s .",
    "this remark serves as foreshadowing for the second paragraph below , and the paper .      in @xcite",
    "are studied markov chains of juggling states , in which the possible throws from a state are given probabilities .",
    "( sometimes probability zero , making them impossible ; e.g. @xcite puts a bound on the highest throw . )",
    "we now define a markov chain that follows the edges _ backwards _ , using a coin with @xmath26heads@xmath27 .",
    "* however , we will never write the arrows as reversed : @xmath28 will have a consistent meaning throughout the paper .",
    "* let @xmath4 be a juggling state .    1 .",
    "flip the coin at most @xmath0 times , or until it comes up tails .",
    "2 .   if the coin never comes up tails , attach @xmath7 to the front of @xmath4 .",
    "if the coin comes up tails on the @xmath29th flip , move the @xmath29th _ last _ @xmath6 in @xmath4 to the front , + leaving a @xmath7 in its place .",
    "example : @xmath30 , so @xmath31 and we flip at most three times . if the flips are    * tails : we get @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 . * heads , then tails : we get @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 . * heads , heads , tails : we get @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 . * heads , heads , heads : we get @xmath38 .",
    "note that the resulting juggling states are exactly those that point to @xmath4 in the digraph ; the @xmath6 that moves is the ball thrown ( if any ; in the all - heads case the `` throw '' is a @xmath2 ) .",
    "our main results in this paper are    * a calculation of the ( quite simple ) stationary distribution of this chain , * a motivation and solution of the chain from linear algebra considerations , and * a study of the typical states in the @xmath39 limit .",
    "the limit @xmath40 ( always tails ) is boring ; after @xmath0 throws we get to the ground state and stay there .",
    "the limit @xmath41 ( @xmath0 fixed ) has no stationary distribution . in  [ sec : stats ] we show the limit @xmath42 is well - behaved if we keep fixed the all - heads probability @xmath43 , which acts as a sort of temperature . specifically , we compute the typical ball density around position @xmath44 to be @xmath45 .",
    "the linear algebra itself suggests in  [ sec : richer ] a markov chain on ( the reverse of ) a richer digraph with distinguishable balls that can bump one another out of position ; we solve this one as well .",
    "( this digraph appeared first in @xcite , though we had been considering it already for a few years ; as far as we can tell our motivations for studying it are different than theirs . )",

    "it s easy to see that if @xmath233 are unhatted states , then @xmath28 in the digraph from  [ sec : richer ] iff there is a directed path in this digraph from @xmath67 to @xmath98 through only hatted states .      as twice before , we put probabilities on the reversed edges .",
    "if @xmath67 is an unhatted state , the only edge into it has a hat on the last number in @xmath67 . whereas if @xmath223 is @xmath67 with a hat at position @xmath2 , the only edge into @xmath223 comes from @xmath67 . in either case the unique edge gets probability @xmath88 .    in the remaining case , @xmath223 has a hat at position @xmath234 , and we must move the hat left one step . if the label to the left is smaller than the hatted label , then we move the hat left with probability @xmath88 and are done .",
    "but if that label is larger , then with probability @xmath235 , we move the label bearing the hat , not just the hat . from the state @xmath236 : @xmath237 ( do nt forget that the markov chain runs backwards along the arrows . )    again , we claim that if @xmath233 are unhatted states , and we start this markov chain at @xmath67 and stop when we next meet an unhatted state , the probability that it is @xmath98 is the same as that given by the markov chain from  [ sec : richer ] .",
