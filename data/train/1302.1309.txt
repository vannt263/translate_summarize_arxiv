    "the study of _ diffusion _ in nearly - integrable hamiltonian dynamical systems of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 are n - dimensional action - angle variables and @xmath0 is a small parameter , constitutes a central problem in hamiltonian dynamical systems theory , in view , in particular , of its multiple applications in physics and astronomy ( see @xcite@xcite for an introduction , the basic review paper @xcite , or @xcite@xcite",
    "@xcite for recent advanced reviews emphasizing various aspects of this subject ) .",
    "it is a well established result that , if @xmath7 , and @xmath8 satisfies appropriate convexity and analyticity conditions ( see section 2 below ) , two distinct regimes characterize the laws of diffusion as a function of @xmath0 : for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a threshold value , the onset of the so - called ` nekhoroshev regime ' takes place @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite . in this case",
    ", the nekhoroshev theorem provides an @xmath11 $ ] upper bound for the speed of diffusion .",
    "the exponent @xmath12 depends on the number of degrees of freedom @xmath13 , while its precise value in local domains of the action space depends also on the multiplicity of the resonance conditions holding in such domains ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism of diffusion caused by _ transition chains _ , as demonstrated in one special example by arnold @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , is conjectured to hold in more general systems of the form ( [ hamgen ] ) ( e.g. @xcite ; note , however , that no formal proof of this fact has been given to date ) .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath14 , the diffusion is driven mainly by the mechanism of _ resonance overlap _",
    "@xcite@xcite @xcite . in this case",
    ", one expects a power - law dependence of the speed of diffusion on @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ; a power law is also found in the case of the so - called ` fast arnold diffusion ' @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusion in weakly chaotic systems has been a subject also of extensive numerical studies over the last three decades ( some indicative references are @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "a detailed study , however , of the very slow diffusion characterizing the ` nekhoroshev regime ' has become possible only in recent years . in this respect ,",
    "we note in particular the series of instructive works @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , where , using the so - called fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ; see @xcite ) , a method was found to depict the resonant structure of the action space in models of three degrees of freedom , or 4d and 6d symplectic mappings being in the nekhoroshev regime @xcite . in @xcite , the mean - square spread in action space @xmath15 was measured as a function of the time @xmath16 for orbits along the chaotic border of a _ simply - resonant _ domain ( see section 2 for a precise definition ) .",
    "it was found that i ) the local character of diffusion is normal , i.e. @xmath17 , and ii ) the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 decreases with @xmath0 faster than a power law .",
    "the exponential fit @xmath19 was given in a subsequent study @xcite .",
    "the estimate obtained in @xcite , through interpolation over five orders of magnitude of the perturbation parameter , yields with with certainty the first digit of the exponent @xmath20 , but the errors in the interpolation make uncertain the second digit in both the above estimates . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath1 was measured as a function of the separatrix splitting @xmath21 of the asymptotic manifolds of simply unstable two - dimensional tori lying at the borders of simple resonances ( see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of @xmath21 itself was based on employing the fli .",
    "it was found that @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 in two resonances of increasing order respectively .",
    "finally , the laws of diffusion in systems violating one or more necessary conditions of the nekhoroshev theorem were investigated in @xcite@xcite , leading to a number of interesting results regarding the dynamical consequences of such violations .",
    "the motivation for the present study stems primarily from the results reported in refs @xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite , and it can be described as follows .",
    "the results obtained so far are very satisfactory from the numerical point of view .",
    "they require , however , computations involving large ensembles of orbits and integration times of the order of billions , or even trillions of periods . on the other hand , we can remark that , in principle , the analytical methods involved in the main theories of chaotic diffusion lend themselves also conveniently to getting quantitative predictions regarding the value of the diffusion coefficient , or the scaling laws of diffusion , in general , in the weakly chaotic regime . for such a goal , however , to be accomplished , it is required that one should be able to carry on expansions of certain quantities up to a very high order in the small parameter @xmath0 ( usually with the aid of a computer ) .",
    "this fact is explicit in nekhoroshev theory , where one needs to reach an expansion order high enough for the asymptotic behavior of the perturbation series to show up .",
    "this has been realized in studies seeking to determine the _ range _ ( in the small parameter value ) and/or the _ conditions of applicability _ of nekhoroshev theory , or , finally , the _ domain of practical stability _ for motions in simple physical systems or models inspired mainly from solar system dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "these studies notwithstanding , the question of central interest in the present paper , namely how to obtain relevant quantitative estimates of the _ local value of the diffusion coefficient d _ in resonant domains ( of various multiplicities ) of the action space via    _ high order expansions _ of perturbation theory , remains , to our knowledge , largely unexplored .    regarding now this last question , it should be noted that the formal analytical apparatus of nekhoroshev theory , entailing the construction of a _ normal form _ in local domains covering the action space of systems of the form ( [ hamgen ] ) , aims to transform the original hamiltonian into one in new canonical variables resuming the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , the normal form , corresponds to a simple dynamics , while @xmath27 , the remainder , induces a perturbation to this dynamics . the so - called ` geometric part ' of nekhoroshev the theorem ensures that , despite allowing in general for chaotic motions , the flow under a multiply - resonant normal form _ alone _ would imply perpetual confinement of all chaotic orbits in balls of radius @xmath28 in the action space .",
    "nevertheless , this picture is altered due to the effects of the remainder which eventually causes the orbits to diffuse away of their initial @xmath28 domain .",
    "now , via a sequence of hamiltonian normalization steps we find that there is an optimal order at which the size of the remainder becomes exponentially small in a power of @xmath29 .",
    "this , in turn , implies an exponentially small _ semi - analytic upper bound _ of the value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , such a bound turns usually to be very unrealistic , as it overestimates by a large factor the true value of @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , it underestimates the time of practical stability ) . we are thus led to conclude that , whereas the remainder @xmath27 constitutes a quantity of primary interest in quantitative applications of nekhoroshev theory , the precise relation between @xmath27 and @xmath1 is apparently very different from what upper bound estimates would suggest . instead , a detailed analysis of the _ effects of the remainder on dynamics _ appears to be necessary in order to formulate a more precise theory of the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath1 .    in the sequel , we present such an analysis in systems of three degrees of freedom .",
    "in this analysis , we still have to rely on an assumption for which numerical indications are available , namely that the local character of diffusion in sufficiently small domains of the action space is ` normal ' , that is , the mean square spread of the actions of the chaotic orbits grows linearly with time ( there are indications that _ global diffusion _ , which concerns ensembles or orbits diffusing in a substantial part of the arnold web over much longer timescales , could also be described as ` normal ' ( see @xcite ) ; however , the issue of the laws of global diffusion can only be hoped to tackle after the laws of local diffusion have been adequately understood ) . in the rest of our analysis , we proceed by expressing all quantities of interest in terms of the remainder function , which , in turn , is calculated in concrete examples by a well - defined algebraic procedure . finally , we estimate via this analysis how @xmath1 depends on the size @xmath2 of the remainder at the optimal normalization order .",
    "it should be noted that the idea that the stability properties of the orbits in nearly - integrable systems depend on the size of the optimal remainder is not new , but it is one permeating nearly all forms of canonical perturbation theory . the novel feature here , instead , is to use @xmath2 not as an upper bound for @xmath1 , but as a way to estimate @xmath1 via examining the relation between the two quantities as determined by independent numerical experiments .",
    "one main prediction is that this relation is altered according to the _ multiplicity of resonance conditions _ holding in the action domain of interest .",
    "more concretely , we predict that the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 scales with @xmath2 as a power - law @xmath30 in simply resonant domains , for some constant @xmath31 . a combination of theoretical arguments found in @xcite@xcite , together with quantitative estimates on the relation between the size of the so - called separatrix splitting ( see subsection 2.3.2 ) and the normal form remainder given in @xcite , suggest @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 in simply resonant domains .",
    "this agrees with the numerical results obtained in a previous study @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a computer - algebraic program was written in order to calculate the optimal normal form as well as the remainder function @xmath34 at the optimal mormalization order in a case of simple resonance , employing the same hamiltonian model as in @xcite .",
    "this operation involved computing about @xmath35 fourier coefficients , at a truncation order in fourier space as high as @xmath36 . comparing the computed size of @xmath2 versus available",
    "numerical data on @xmath1 from @xcite , the scaling @xmath37 was found by numerical fitting . in the present paper , after presenting some theoretical results , we make a similar numerical calculation as in @xcite but in the case of a double resonance . in order to reach the optimal normalization , we had to extend all normal form calculations up to the fourier order @xmath38 ( @xmath39 coefficients ) .",
    "we thus determined the size of the optimal remainder @xmath2 for many different values of the small parameter @xmath0 . in the same time",
    ", we computed the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 for the same values of @xmath0 by a purely numerical procedure involving runs of ensembles of chaotic orbits ( see section 3 ) .",
    "finally , we made two independent numerical comparisons of the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the latter yield the power laws @xmath40 is close to 2 in doubly resonant domains , albeit with a small noticeable difference even in this case , which probably requires a more precise theory to interpret .",
    "besides the above computation , our analysis using high order normal forms resulted in a relevant result regarding the possibility to visualize how the phenomenon of arnold diffusion proceeds locally , within a doubly - resonant domain , by materializing the computation of a convenient set of variables helping to this purpose , that were proposed in the work @xcite .",
    "we note that numerical evidence for arnold diffusion of orbits entering from simple to double resonances was presented in @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a detailed topological description of this phenomenon .",
    "the whole computation consists of : i ) computing a set of resonant canonical action - angle variables via a sequence of lie canonical transformations , ii ) taking a 2d poincar surface of section of the _ doubly - resonant normal form dynamics _ ( which represents a system of two degrees of freedom ) , and ( more importantly ) iii ) using the _ energy @xmath41 of the normal form _ as the third variable , showing the effect of arnold diffusion .",
    "according to theory , the value of @xmath41 changes exponentially slowly in time due to the effect of the remainder . in the sequel we refer to this phenomenon as ` drift ' , although in reality it means that a number of quantities can be characterized as undergoing random walk during the whole diffusion process . besides setting the timescale of diffusion",
    ", the drift can be viewed also as the source of a dynamical phenomenon , namely the communication between chaotic domains that would be otherwise isolated under the doubly - resonant normal form hamiltonian flow .",
    "we show in a true example the excursion of a chaotic orbit within the doubly - resonant domain as it appears in the above proposed set of variables .",
    "we thus identify a sequence of chaotic transitions of such an orbit from one resonant domain to another .",
    "in fact , in each transition the orbit bypasses the barriers imposed by normal form dynamics via a ` third dimension ' , i.e. the slowly drifting value of @xmath41 .",
    "we finally argue that , besides their practical utility , such illustrations are also suggestive of the geometric structure underlying the asymptotic manifolds of lower - dimensional tori filling the phase space in the domain of a double resonance .",
    "these manifolds are important , because , following the spirit of arnold s original work @xcite , it has been widely conjectured that their heteroclinic intersections constitute a primary cause of arnold diffusion . of course , proving this fact represents a well known important open problem of dynamical systems theory .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section 2 presents the theory , focusing on the normal form algorithm , multiply - resonant dynamics , effect of the remainder , and , finally , on the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we describe in some length all necessary theoretical steps in order to render the paper as self - contained as possible .",
    "section 3 then passes to the numerical results .",
    "we present i ) the results from the normal form computer - algebraic construction , ii ) the visualization of arnold diffusion using appropriate variables based on the normal form computation , iii ) the numerical calculation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 , and , finally iv ) the comparison of @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "section 4 summarizes the main conclusions of the present study .",
    "most statements made in subsections 2.1 and 2.2 below , regarding the properties of the hamiltonian models considered as well as the algorithm by which we perform hamiltonian normalization , are applicable to systems of an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom . in order , however , to be consistent with the rest of the paper , we use everywhere a notation referring to systems of three degrees of freedom . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of subsection 2.3 applies to the study of the diffusion in doubly or simply resonant domains . in systems of three degrees of freedom ,",
    "the latter represent the only possible multiplicities of a resonance condition , while in systems of more than three degrees of freedom there are also cases of intermediate resonance multiplicities between one and the maximal .",
    "the latter s study , nevertheless , is well beyond our present computational capacity , and thus it is left as an open problem .",
    "we consider three degrees of freedom systems of the form ( [ hamgen ] ) , where @xmath8 satisfies the following analyticity and convexity conditions :    \\i ) _ analyticity : _ @xmath8 is assumed to be an analytic function in a complexified domain of its arguments .",
    "namely , we assume that there is an open domain @xmath42 and a positive number @xmath43 such that for all points @xmath44 and all complex quantities @xmath45 satisfying the inequalities @xmath46 , the function @xmath47 admits a convergent taylor expansion @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the entries of the hessian matrix of @xmath47 at @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is a positive constant @xmath52 such that for all @xmath53 , @xmath54 admits an absolutely convergent fourier expansion @xmath55 in a domain where all three angles satisfy @xmath56 , @xmath57 . by the fourier theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this condition implies that the coefficients @xmath58 decay exponentially with the @xmath59modulus @xmath60 , that is , there is a positive constant @xmath61 such that the bound @xmath62 .",
    "we finally assume that all coefficients @xmath63 admit taylor expansions with respect to @xmath51 @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 are the entries of the hessian matrix of @xmath58 at @xmath51 ) , which are convergent in the same union of domains as for @xmath47 .",
    "\\ii ) _ convexity : _ for the hessian matrix @xmath66 , which is real symmetric , we assume a simple quasi - convexity condition , namely that for all @xmath67 either two of the ( real ) eigenvalues of @xmath66 have the same sign and one is equal to zero , or all three eigenvalues have the same sign . furthermore , we define two constants : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a label of only non - zero eigenvalues @xmath70 of @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath71 or @xmath72 if there are two or three non - zero eigenvalues respectively .    as will be discussed in detail in subsection 2.3 , the quasi - convexity condition is essential , since it introduces a confinement of the orbits for exponentially long times on a surface arising from the condition of preservation of the energy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now give some definitions allowing to characterize resonant dynamics .    a _ resonant manifold _ @xmath73 associated with a non - zero wavevector @xmath74 with co - prime integer components @xmath75 is the two - dimensional locus defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath67 be such that all three frequencies @xmath78 , @xmath79 are different from zero .",
    "we now distinguish the following three cases : + i ) _ non - resonance : _ no resonant manifold @xmath73 contains @xmath51 .",
    "\\ii ) _ simple resonance : _ one resonant manifold @xmath73 contains @xmath51 .",
    "\\iii ) _ double resonance : _ more than one resonant manifolds contain @xmath51 . in the latter case ,",
    "it is possible to choose two linearly independent vectors @xmath80 such that all resonant manifolds @xmath81 containing @xmath51 are labeled by vectors @xmath74 which are linear combinations of the chosen vectors @xmath80 with rational coefficients .",
    "the intersection of these manifolds forms a one - dimensional _ resonant junction_. a doubly - resonant point @xmath51 always corresponds to the intersection of a resonant junction with a constant energy surface @xmath82 .",
    "+ in the above definitions , resonant manifolds @xmath73 of all possible wavevectors @xmath74 have been considered .",
    "it is well known , however , that in normal form theory a natural truncation limit @xmath83 arises in fourier space ( see below ) .",
    "accounting for this possibility , we call a point @xmath67 i ) non - resonant , ii ) simply resonant , or iii ) doubly resonant _ with respect to a k  truncation _ , if the number of resonant manifolds @xmath73 with @xmath83 passing through @xmath51 are i ) zero , ii ) one and iii ) more than one respectively .    finally , it will be convenient to introduce a definition concerning _ open domains _ in @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a ball of radius @xmath86 around one point @xmath51 in @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath47 satisfies convexity conditions as assumed above , for @xmath86 small whatsoever the domain @xmath85 is crossed by a dense set of resonant manifolds @xmath73 . however , for any fixed value of the positive integer @xmath87 , only a finite subset of the manifolds @xmath73 satisfy @xmath83 .",
    "the domain @xmath85 is then called : i ) non - resonant , ii ) simply - resonant , and iii ) doubly - resonant with respect to the @xmath87truncation if @xmath51 is , respectively , non - resonant , simply - resonant or doubly - resonant , and no other resonant manifolds @xmath73 with @xmath83 cross @xmath85 except for the ones passing through @xmath51 .",
    "all our estimates on the speed of diffusion are based on an appropriate normal form construction . in this , we adopt the method exposed in detail in @xcite , which lends itself conveniently to i ) developing a computer - algebraic program , and ii ) deriving analytical estimates on the size of various quantities appearing in the course of hamiltonian normalization .",
    "the main elements of this method are : + _ expansion centers . _",
    "the action space can be covered by domains @xmath85 , centered around points @xmath51 which serve as expansion centers of both the original hamiltonian and the normal form .",
    "we choose the points @xmath51 to belong to the set of all doubly - resonant points of @xmath84 , denoted by @xmath88 , and by setting @xmath86 as of order @xmath28 .",
    "the covering is possible because @xmath88 is dense in @xmath84 .",
    "a normal form construction as done below is valid within one domain @xmath85 ( this is essentially the same starting point as in lochak s @xcite analytic construction leading to a proof of the nekhoroshev theorem ) .",
    "a crucial remark is that the characterization of dynamics within @xmath85 as non resonant , simply resonant , or doubly resonant depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this is because , as shown below , the optimal normal form truncation order @xmath89 in fourier space depends on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , for a given value of @xmath87 , the set @xmath88 can be decomposed in three disjoint sets @xmath90 , containing all non - resonant , simply resonant and doubly resonant points respectively with respect to the @xmath87truncation .",
    "thus , the characterization of resonant dynamics within @xmath85 depends on whether , according to the value of @xmath87 , @xmath51 belongs to @xmath91 , @xmath92 , or @xmath93 .",
    "+ _ resonant module : _ let @xmath51 be a point of @xmath88 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 two linearly independent vectors such that @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "more than one choices of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are possible . in the sequel",
    "we choose @xmath98 and @xmath99 so that @xmath100 is minimal .",
    "the vector @xmath101 defined by @xmath102 is parallel to the vector @xmath103 since @xmath104 for all @xmath74 satisfying @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 are not co - prime integers , we re - define @xmath109 by dividing the @xmath110 by their greatest common divisor .",
    "the set @xmath111 is hereafter called the resonant module associated with the point @xmath112 .",
    "the resonant module includes wavevectors @xmath74 whose respective trigonometric terms @xmath113 are to be retained in the normal form .",
    "+ _ action re - scaling : _ from now on we focus on the construction of the normal form in one specific domain @xmath85 .",
    "it has been mentioned already that it is convenient to choose @xmath86 as a quantity scaling proportionally to @xmath114 . the simplest way to accommodate such",
    "a choice is by introducing the following re - scaling of all action variables within @xmath85 : @xmath115 this re - scaling greatly simplifies the normal form algorithm , because it formally removes all terms besides linear in the actions from the kernel of the so - called homological equation ( see below , or @xcite for details ) by which the normalizing generating functions are determined .",
    "eq.([resc ] ) does not define a canonical transformation .",
    "however , the correct equations of motion in the variables @xmath116 are produced by the hamiltonian function @xmath117 , i.e. ( neglecting a constant ) @xmath118 where the first line in the above equation comes from the integrable part @xmath47 of the original hamiltonian ( eq.([h0exp ] ) ) , while the second line comes from the perturbation @xmath54 ( eq.([h1four ] ) ) given the series expansion of the fourier coefficients as in eq.([hkexp ] ) .",
    "+ _ book - keeping : _ we now split the hamiltonian ( [ hamexp2 ] ) in parts of different order of smallness , which are to be normalized step by step .",
    "the function ( [ hamexp2 ] ) contains terms of various orders in the small parameter @xmath114 .",
    "however , the presence of a second ` small parameter ' @xmath119 is implied in ( [ hamexp2 ] ) by the exponential decay of all fourier coefficients @xmath120 , @xmath65 , etc . , due to eq.([anal ] )",
    "( see @xcite pp.90 - 91 for a thorough exposition of the role of this small parameter in nekhoroshev theory ) .",
    "we take both parameters into account by introducing an integer @xmath121 such that @xmath122 , i.e. by setting : @xmath123~~.\\ ] ] using @xmath121 , the hamiltonian ( [ hamexp2 ] ) can be split in groups of practically the same order of smallness .",
    "this is realized by artificially introducing a ` book - keeping ' coefficient @xmath124 in front of each term in ( [ hamexp2 ] ) , whose numerical value is set equal to unity at the end of the calculation .",
    "furthermore , for a term of the form @xmath125 we set @xmath126+\\mu$ ] .    regarding the above ` book - keeping ' process it is worth noting the following : i ) this way of splitting the hamiltonian in different orders of smallness results in a finite number of terms appearing in every power of @xmath127 .",
    "ii ) this technique is suggested already by poincar @xcite and arnold @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dependence of @xmath121 on @xmath0 is weak , since it is logarithmic , so that an alternative choice to the ` ansatz ' ( [ kprime ] ) is to set @xmath128 . in fact , according to giorgilli @xcite this is an optimal choice .",
    "iii ) since , at every normalization order , we have a reduction of the analyticity domain , one could consider re - defining @xmath121 at every normalization step .",
    "however , this is hardly tractable from an algorithmic point of view . instead , keeping @xmath121 constant at all normalization orders",

    "let us recall that the purpose of the normalization is to introduce a sequence of canonical transformations @xmath145",
    "@xmath146 @xmath147 so that the hamiltonian expressed as a function of the new variables allows one to more easily identify the main features of dynamics .",
    "after @xmath148 normalization steps , the old variables @xmath149 are expressed in terms of the new variables @xmath150 , and the hamiltonian @xmath151 takes the form @xmath152 the terms @xmath153 and @xmath154 are called the _ normal form _ and the _ remainder _ respectively .",
    "the normal form is a finite expression which contains terms up to order @xmath148 in the book - keeping constant @xmath127 , while the remainder is a series containing terms of order @xmath155 and beyond .",
    "the mathematical structure of the normal form term @xmath156 is such as to imply an easily identifiable dynamics in the variables @xmath157 ( e.g. an oscillator or pendulum dynamics ) . on the other hand ,",

    "the local chaos around one resonance is isolated from the local chaos around the other resonances .",
    "in fact , the normal form dynamics induces the presence of rotational kam tori which , in this approximation ( @xmath276 ) , completely obstruct the communication among the resonances .",

    "this is shown in the left panel of fig.[fgdbleresmodel ] for an ellipse @xmath279 , with the corresponding phase portrait shown in the right back panel .",
    "we note in particular the ` merging ' of all three resonant domains one into the other , which produces a large connected chaotic domain surrounding all three island chains ( and many other smaller chains , not visible in this scale ) .",
    "the value of the critical energy @xmath280 marking the onset of large scale resonance overlap can be estimated as follows : each resonant strip intersects one fixed energy ellipse on one arc segment .",

    "doing so , computer memory limitations restrict all computed expansions to a maximum order @xmath403 in the book - keeping parameter @xmath127 , or maximum order @xmath404 in fourier space .",
    "in fact , for @xmath405 we perform at most 14 normalization steps , so that the remainder contains terms of at least three consecutive orders in @xmath127 , namely @xmath406 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "as explained below , this allows us to perform some numerical tests regarding the convergence of the remainder series when the optimal normalization order is as high as @xmath158=14 ( or @xmath409 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath410",
    "we allow for one more normalization step ( @xmath406 ) in order to get as close as possible to the optimal order , which , as shown below for @xmath411 is larger than 14 .",
    "thus , for the calculation of the corresponding remainder value at this order ( @xmath406 ) we necessarily have to rely on the sum of only two rather than three or more consecutive terms .    writing the truncated ( at order 17 ) remainder function as : @xmath412 where @xmath413 are the terms of order @xmath414 in the book - keeping parameter @xmath127 allows us to probe numerically the convergence of the remainder function within any chosen domain @xmath85 in action space .",
    "to this end , at any normalization order @xmath148 , let us consider a disk @xmath415 in the space of the transformed action variables ( we neglect the action @xmath416 which , in the particular case of the hamiltonian ( [ hamfr ] ) , is dummy , i.e. it does not appear in any higher order term of either the normal form or the remainder ) .",

    "the maximum value of @xmath43 for which the series @xmath428 converges absolutely sets the size of the doubly - resonant domain @xmath429 ( in non - scaled variables ) where the normal form calculations are valid . in practice , we are interested in the diffusion of orbits with initial conditions inside this domain",
    ". in particular , in subsection 3.2 we will consider orbits starting on the circle @xmath430 .",
    "all our numerical orbits are studied up to a time in which their distance from the center of the double resonance changes significantly less than @xmath431 ( see below ) .",
    "variations of this order at maximum are found when we measure @xmath43 either in the original canonical action variables or in the variables after the optimal canonical transformation .",
    "thus , for all the orbits we can set a safe outer boundary @xmath432 within which they are well confined .",

    "it is remarkable that the asymptotic tail laws for all @xmath148 appear to follow an exponential decay with the same constant @xmath446 , i.e. with nearly the same value as the constant appearing in the analyticity condition of the original hamiltonian ( cf .",
    "eq.([expdecay ] ) ) .",
    "this effect shows that , while in the usual proofs of the nekhoroshev theorem one requires a reduction of the analyticity domain at every normalization step , i.e. one considers bounds of the form @xmath447 with @xmath448 , in practice the dependence of the coefficients @xmath449 on @xmath439 is more complicated than a simple exponential decay law .",

    "( this is verified also by computing numerically a convergence criterion like dalembert s criterion ) .",
    "the lower and middle curves show now the same effect for the normalization orders @xmath442 and @xmath452 respectively .",
    "note that the three consecutive truncation orders @xmath463 and @xmath408 allowed for the computation of the remainder at the normalization order @xmath452 are essentially sufficient to demonstrate the convergence of the remainder .",
    "hence , @xmath464 represents a good numerical estimator of the value of the remainder series for normalization orders up to @xmath452 . however , the main effect to note is that the estimated remainder value @xmath465 found for @xmath452 is larger than the one for @xmath442 , implying that the _ optimal _ normalization order @xmath158 is below @xmath452 .",

    "the resonant structure in the action space ( around @xmath51 ) can be visualized by employing the method of the fli map as in @xcite .",
    "we recall that the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) is a numerical indicator of chaos , defined for one orbit by @xmath472 where @xmath473 is a deviation vector , i.e. in our case @xmath474 found after solving the variational equations of motion up to the time @xmath16 from some initial conditions @xmath475 .",
    "by properly choosing a threshold value @xmath476 , orbits with @xmath477 are characterized as regular , and those with @xmath478 as chaotic .",

    "this allows for illustrating the resonant structure in action space , as shown in fig.[fgdbleres ] , which is an fli map in an action domain including our chosen doubly - resonant point @xmath479 for three different values of @xmath0 . in all three panels , there are resonances projecting on @xmath381 as single yellow or orange thick lines , while other resonances project as strips with a green or blue interior zone delimited by pairs of nearly parallel yellow or red lines .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this difference is only due to the particular choice of surface of section ( @xmath480 , @xmath481 , similar to @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the yellow lines marking all resonances represent the intersection of the thin separatrix - like chaotic layers formed around each resonance with the chosen surface of section .",
    "this produces a pair of nearly parallel yellow or orange lines for any resonance ( of the form @xmath482 ) whose leading fourier coefficient @xmath63 of the resonant term @xmath113 in the original hamiltonian expansion has a negative real part , while it produces a single yellow or orange thick line if @xmath483 is positive . in the latter case , the domain of regular orbits inside the resonance has no projection on the chosen surface of section , while in the former case it projects as a strip of green or blue color .     of the hamiltonian [ hamfr ] for @xmath480 , @xmath484 , around the doubly - resonant point @xmath479 for ( a ) @xmath402 , ( b ) @xmath466 , ( c ) @xmath485 .",

    "similarly , the single yellow - red thick line going from bottom right to top left is the resonance @xmath492 , whose corresponding ( also basic ) wavevector is @xmath99 . we also clearly distinguish two resonances of order @xmath493 , namely @xmath494 ( blue ) , and @xmath495 ( green ) .",
    "many other higher order resonances cross the central doubly - resonant point @xmath479 , denoted hereafter by o , but they are not so visible in the scale of fig.[fgdbleres]a .    the resonant strips of all previous resonances join each other forming a domain of double resonance around o. the extent of this domain can be determined roughly by drawing concentric circles around the point o. such circles correspond to nearly constant normal form energy values , as can be seen by noting that , for the particular hamiltonian function ( [ hamfr ] ) , the coefficients @xmath496 of eq.([hamresn12 ] ) have the values @xmath497 @xmath498 , and @xmath499 . applying eqs.([z02],[ene0],[jr0 ] ) for the particular resonant wavevectors given by ( [ resvectors ] ) , the doubly - resonant normal form of the hamiltonian ( [ hamfr ] ) expressed in resonant variables takes the form @xmath500 where the @xmath501 terms are trigonometric polynomials of the resonant angles @xmath502 , @xmath503 , while @xmath504 is a constant which appears only in the numerical values of the quantity @xmath505 called , hereafter , the normal form energy ( @xmath41 differs from the quantity @xmath230 defined in eq.([eneprime ] ) only by the constant @xmath506 ) .",

    "since the angle @xmath222 is ignorable in the hamiltonian ( [ ene02fr ] ) , @xmath223 is an integral of the flow of @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , since for the particular choice of hamiltonian model ( [ hamfr ] ) the action @xmath416 is dummy , implying that @xmath416 can be assigned any arbitrary value without affecting the dynamical evolution of any other canonical variable , we can always choose the value of @xmath416 so that @xmath508",
    ". then , the normal form energy condition @xmath509 implies @xmath510 where @xmath43 is a @xmath511 quantity . transforming to the original non - scaled action variables we also find @xmath512 whereby",
    "@xmath513 is interpreted as the radius of a circle , around o , corresponding to a constant normal form energy condition .",
    "it follows that the set of all possible normal form energy values are represented on the @xmath381 plane as a set of concentric circles around o. three such circles are drawn in fig.[fgdbleres]a , corresponding to @xmath402 and @xmath514 ( outer circle ) , @xmath515 ( middle circle ) , and @xmath516 ( inner circle ) .",
    "their main difference concerns the degree of resonance overlapping in each case .",
    "namely , for a value of @xmath517 , corresponding to the outer circle @xmath514 , the main visible resonances of fig.([fgdbleres]a ) intersect the circle in some arcs only , while the remaining parts of the circle lie in the regular ( non - resonant ) domain . in the latter parts , the normal form dynamics alone would imply the existence of a set of kolmogorov - arnold - moser invariant tori of large measure . on the contrary , in the inner circle , corresponding to @xmath518 , all resonances essentially overlap , producing a strongly chaotic domain .",
    "the middle circle corresponds to @xmath519 , which is close to the critical energy below which resonance overlapping dominates the dynamics .",
    "the remaining panels of fig.[fgdbleres ] show what happens when @xmath0 is increased by a factor 5 ( @xmath466 , fig .",
    "[ fgdbleres]b ) , or 15 ( @xmath485 , fig .",
    "[ fgdbleres]c ) with respect to fig.[fgdbleres]a .",
    "a main feature to notice is that , by increasing @xmath0 , many more resonances ` show up ' in the fli map .",
    "furthermore , the size of all resonant domains grows proportionally to @xmath114 , as verified in fig.[fgdbleres ] , where by augmenting the scale in panels ( b ) and ( c ) by a factor @xmath520 and @xmath521 respectively with respect to panel ( a ) , the widths of all resonant strips passing through @xmath522 remain essentially unaltered in all three panels .",
    "thus , the only essential change is the increase of chaos as @xmath0 increases .",
    "namely , we see that the chaotic layers delimiting the borders of each resonance become thicker as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this also increases the resonance overlapping locally , close to the points of resonance crossings .     defined as in eqs.([restra ] ) for the hamiltonian ( [ hamfr ] ) , for the same surface of section and using the same color scale as in fig.([fgdbleres ] ) .",

    "[ fgresportrait]a , c ) , or when there is substantial resonance overlap ( @xmath524 , figs.[fgresportrait]b , d ) .",
    "the upper panels correspond to fli maps as in fig.([fgdbleres ] ) . here , however , instead of the action variables ( @xmath530 ) we use the resonant re - scaled actions @xmath237 , defined as in eq.([restra ] ) , where , for each point in the action space of the original variables we compute the values of the transformed actions @xmath531 , @xmath79 by the composition of the lie canonical transformations resulting from the computer - algebraic program calculating the optimal normal form @xmath26 .",
    "since the same program renders also the algebraic form of @xmath26 , we use this expression to derive the hamiltonian equations of motion of the normal form alone , namely @xmath532 , @xmath533 , @xmath534 , @xmath535 , @xmath536 , while we set @xmath537 . for each value of @xmath41 , we then compute _ numerical orbits under the normal form dynamics _ alone via the previous equations .",
    "finally we plot a convenient surface of section of the normal form flow , taken by the condition @xmath538 .",
    "these sections are shown in figs.[fgresportrait]c , d , for the normal form energy values @xmath529 and @xmath539 respectively .",
    "the corresponding circles , through eq.([eres ] ) , are shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , superposed to the color background yielding the fli map in the resonant action variables for @xmath528 .",
    "the main feature of this plot is the exact correspondence between the values of @xmath540 where each resonance intersects the circle corresponding to @xmath509 in panels ( a ) and ( c ) , and the projection of these values to thin chaotic layers delimiting the same resonance in the corresponding surface of section .",
    "in fact , inside each resonance we have regular orbits corresponding to islands of stability on the surface of section .",
    "furthermore , while at the normal form energy value @xmath529 there are many rotational kam tori separating these resonances , at the value @xmath524 these tori are destroyed and substantial resonance overlap takes place .",
    "this fact leads to the creation of a connected chaotic domain surrounding all main resonances in the surface of section of fig.[fgresportrait]d .",
    "this , in turn , implies that under the normal form dynamics alone no communication is allowed from one resonance to the other for the normal form energy value @xmath529 ( which in this approximation remains constant in time ) , while such communication is possible throughout the whole connected chaotic domain for @xmath524 .",
    "in fact , the phase portrait of fig.[fgresportrait]d renders visually clear that chaos is rather strong in this case .",
    "however , as emphasized in section 2 , this fact has no consequences regarding the possibility of long excursions in the action space , since all motions in this approximation would be bounded on circles like those of figs.[fgresportrait]a , b . on the contrary ,",
    "such excursions are only possible due to the effect of the remainder , which causes the chaotic orbits to slowly ` drift ' from circle to circle as the value of @xmath41 changes slowly in time .",

    "fig.[fgarnolddif]c , now , shows a 3d plot in the variables @xmath552 , visualizing the ` third dimension ' along which the arnold diffusion progresses for the same orbit . from this plot",
    "we can clearly see the effect of the remainder , which can be considered as a very slow modification of the normal form dynamics acting on a timescale of the order of @xmath574 periods .",
    "the normal form dynamics , on the other hand , describes well the motion over shorter timescales , of the order of @xmath575@xmath576 periods . in order to show the dynamical effects happening on both timescales , we adopt the following numerical procedure : taking 20 equidistant values of @xmath553 , @xmath554 in the interval @xmath555",
    ", we first find the times @xmath556 within the interval @xmath557 ( where the motion is , in general , in the inward direction ) when the normal form energy value @xmath546 of the numerical orbit approaches the closest possible to the values @xmath553 .",
    "then , for each @xmath558 , we set the momentary values of all canonical variables of the numerical orbit at the time @xmath556 as initial conditions via which we compute the corresponding values of all the new resonant canonical variables following the composition of the corresponding lie canonical transformations . with these values as initial conditions , we compute 1000 poincar consequents of the normal form flow alone on the same surface of section as defined in figs.[fgresportrait]c , d . the same procedure is repeated in the second interval @xmath559 , where the motion is in general in the outward direction .",
    "the whole set of poincar consequents ( points @xmath270 gathered in this way are plotted in the 2d sections of the parallelepiped of fig.[fgarnolddif]c , along with the variations of the value of the normal form energy @xmath546 ( sampled more frequently ) which are shown in the third dimension .",
    "the details of the filling process of the various resonant chaotic layers located in the doubly - resonant domain are now clearly seen . in particular",
    ", we note that the chaotic orbit fills the whole separatrix layer of the initial resonance @xmath494 in a timescale much shorter than the one required for substantial drift in the @xmath41 direction . after a transient ` back and forth ' motion around @xmath577 , the orbit then moves slowly towards the value @xmath524 , where all important resonances overlap . in the intermediate time interval ( red )",
    ", we clearly see the filling of the stochastic layers of both resonances @xmath495 and @xmath491 , while global transport is allowed by the normal form dynamics from one resonance to the other . as",
    ", however , the remainder effect causes a new motion of the orbit outwards ( i.e. towards higher values of @xmath41 ( green ) ) , the orbit is eventually captured at the resonance @xmath491 , and stays there until the end of the simulation at @xmath560 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the fact that the orbit moves in the outward direction at @xmath560 does not guarantee that there will be no further return inwards .",
    "in fact , we find that most orbits undergo several ` in - out ' cycles like the one described in fig.[fgarnolddif ] , before eventually abandoning the doubly - resonant domain . as an estimate , for @xmath528 we find that the number of cycles before a final exit from the doubly - resonant domain is of the order of 10 , while the total time required for this effect is of the order of @xmath578 to @xmath579 periods .",
    "furthermore , the probability of exit along one particular resonance decreases as the order of the resonance increases .",
    "this is expected , since the width of resonances scales with their order @xmath439 as @xmath580 , while the fast filling of the innermost chaotic domains where all the resonances overlap is nearly ergodic .    finally , we point out that a visualization of the diffusion process like in fig.[fgarnolddif]c clearly suggests that the diffusion is driven by the intersections of the asymptotic manifolds of lower - dimensional objects ( like hyperbolic 2d tori ) all along the path in which the diffusion takes place . however , locating such tori , and studying their manifolds is a task that can not be accomplished by the use of the birkhoff normal form as above . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter provides good initial conditions for a numerical search of such tori .",
    "this subject is proposed for future study .",
    "our final goal is to obtain numerical estimates of the value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 as well as its relation to the size @xmath2 of the optimal normal form remainder as @xmath0 is varied in the interval @xmath581 .    to this end",
    "we implement the following numerical procedure : for any fixed value of @xmath0 , using the information from the fli maps , we first select 100 initial conditions corresponding to on a circle defined as in eq.([eres12 ] ) , where the radius is chosen equal to @xmath582 for such a choice of @xmath43 , the corresponding circle lies inside the resonance overlap domain , ensuring that the short time dynamics is dominated by the doubly - resonant normal form",
    ". however , in longer times all these orbits exhibit weakly chaotic diffusion .",
    "the complete set of initial conditions for one orbit on the circle @xmath583 are found by solving simultaneously for @xmath584 and @xmath585 the equation of the circle ( eq.([eres ] ) ) as well as an equation for the initial angle @xmath586 $ ] , where , for each initial condition , @xmath587 is chosen by visual inspection so as to correspond to an initial condition in the domain of each one of the main overlapping resonances .     with @xmath430 , for ( a ) @xmath454 , ( b ) ) @xmath588 and ( c ) @xmath434 .",
    "the black points show the orbits consequents on the surface of section up to a time @xmath589 .",
    "all three orbits are diffusing outwards . the circle with radius @xmath590 is shown in pink . ]",
    "we then follow numerically these orbits for a time long enough so that the mean change of their radial distance from the center is large enough to allow for a reliable computation of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "let @xmath591 be the instantaneous value of the distance from the center for any such orbit .",
    "the quantity @xmath592 ^ 2 $ ] changes as an orbit slowly drifts from one circle to another .",
    "figure [ fgdifinout ] shows this effect for three orbits corresponding to the same initial angle @xmath587 but for three different values of @xmath0 , namely @xmath454 ( fig.[fgdifinout]a ) , @xmath588 ( fig.[fgdifinout]b ) , and @xmath434 ( fig.[fgdifinout]c ) .",
    "the orbits are shown by the black points on the section @xmath593 , @xmath480 , superposed as usually to the colored background of the fli map .",
    "the pink circles in each panel are the circles @xmath594 , where the orbits initial conditions lie .",
    "apart from an overall change of the size of the circle of initial conditions with @xmath0 , a simple visual comparison of the three panels suffices to conclude that they imply quite different diffusion rates of their depicted orbits . in all three panels , the orbits ( black points ) are shown up to a time @xmath589 , which is quite long compared to the time needed to fill the chaotic domain along the circle @xmath457 . however , when @xmath454 ( fig.[fgdifinout]a ) , the orbit s plot shows that the orbit exhibits no discernible transverse motion with respect to this circle , despite the fact that the orbit lies entirely within a rather strong chaotic domain ( yellow in the fli scale ) .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath0 is raised to @xmath588 ( fig.[fgdifinout]b ) , the orbit is observed to create a small ring around its initial circle , implying that the diffusion is visible in this timescale .",
    "increasing @xmath0 still further ( @xmath434 , fig.[fgdifinout]c ) , causes now a rather fast diffusion , which leads to the orbit following clearly a preferential ` exit resonance ' , where the diffusion continues essentially as in the simple resonance case ( subsection 2.3.2 ) .     and",

    "the comparison is even more straightforward in the variables @xmath223 computed by the transformed and by the original action variables . in the former , we can clearly see the drift phenomenon for both orbits , which results in a slow change of the value of @xmath223 ( which is an approximate integral ) at the fifth digit .",
    "in contrast , this phenomenon is completely hidden when @xmath223 is computed in the original variables , since the corresponding plot is dominated by oscillations of at least one order of magnitude larger amplitude than the drift effect .",

    "the dependence of @xmath158 on @xmath0 is found to be an inverse power - law with an exponent in agreement with theory .",

    "estimates on the value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 are quantified by considering a ` random walk ' model for the slow drift of the value of the normal form energy due to the remainder .",

    "<S> a detailed numerical study is presented of the slow diffusion ( arnold diffusion ) taking place around resonance crossings in nearly integrable hamiltonian systems of three degrees of freedom in the so - called ` nekhoroshev regime ' . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to construct estimates regarding the speed of diffusion based on the numerical values of a truncated form of the so - called remainder of a normalized hamiltonian function , and to compare them with the outcomes of direct numerical experiments using ensembles of orbits . in this comparison </S>",
    "<S> we examine , one by one , the main steps of the so - called analytic and geometric parts of the nekhoroshev theorem . </S>",
    "<S> thus : i ) we review and implement an algorithm @xcite for hamiltonian normalization in multiply resonant domains which is implemented as a computer program making calculations up to a high normalization order . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) we compute the dependence of the optimal normalization order on the small parameter @xmath0 in a specific model and compare the result with theoretical estimates on this dependence . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) we examine in detail the consequences of assuming simple convexity conditions for the unperturbed hamiltonian on the geometry of the resonances and on the phase space structure around resonance crossings . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) we discuss the dynamical mechanisms by which the remainder of the optimal hamiltonian normal form drives the diffusion process . through these steps </S>",
    "<S> , we are led to two main results : i ) we construct in our concrete example a convenient set of variables , proposed first by benettin and gallavotti @xcite , in which the phenomenon of arnold diffusion in doubly resonant domains can be clearly visualized . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) we determine , by numerical fitting of our data the dependence of the local diffusion coefficient @xmath1 on the size @xmath2 of the optimal remainder function , and we compare this with a heuristic argument based on the assumption of normal diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> we find a power law @xmath3 , where the constant @xmath4 has a small positive value depending also on the multiplicity of the resonance considered .    </S>",
