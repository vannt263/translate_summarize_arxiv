    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism thought to be operating at the fast shocks of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) is likely responsible for the galactic cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration up to the `` knee - region '' energies ( see e.g. @xcite ) and may even exceed @xmath0 ev as it was advocated by @xcite for the case of nuclei accelerated in an isolated young type iib snrs .",
    "the basic features of the dsa process have been revealed in the pioneering papers of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite where the high efficiency of the acceleration mechanism was shown .",
    "effects of nonlinear backreaction of the accelerated particles on the structure of the supersonic shock flow were discussed later by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the pressure of accelerated particles can modify the bulk plasma flow in the shock upstream and that may result in a substantial increase of the flow compression and flattening in the particle spectra at the maximal energies .",
    "magnetic field fluctuations in the shock vicinity may be highly amplified by instabilities driven by the cosmic ray current and cr - pressure gradient in the strong shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that is an important factor to determine the highest energies of particles accelerated by shocks .",
    "the maximum energy of accelerated particles strongly differs for different types of supernovae ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it depends on the circumstellar medium around the supernova progenitor star .",
    "moreover , core - collapsed supernovae produced by massive stars often occur in ob - star associations where the intense radiation of hot massive stars , powerful stellar winds and supernova shocks strongly modify the interstellar environment , producing large hot cavities of a few tens of parsec size , called superbubbles . for instance , the carina ob stars complex contains about 70 o - type stars and more than hundred b0-b3 stars confined in a region of about 40 pc size @xcite .",
    "recently , fermi telescope detected an extended cocoon - shape source of gamma - ray emission associated with a massive star - forming region cygnus ob2 @xcite .",
    "the detection indicates the presence of active particle acceleration processes in the association .",
    "cygnus ob2 contains over 50 o - type stars and hundreds of b - type stars @xcite .",
    "compact sources like binary massive stars ( with the stars separated by a few astronomical units ) may accelerate relativistic particles ( @xcite ) on a month time scale .",
    "collective emission of such binaries may contribute to the gamma - ray flux observed by fermi .",
    "however , if the detected gamma - ray emission is truly extended , it can be attributed to relativistic particles accelerated by multiple shocks in the superbubble , as modeled by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "multiple successive interactions of particles with large shocks and rarefactions of a superbubble scale size occur on the time scale of about 10@xmath1 years .    in the present paper we model a class of a few parsec size particle accelerators associated with collision of a young supernova shock with a fast stellar wind of a massive star .",
    "the modelled stage starts a few hundred years before the supernova shock collides with the wind termination shock as it is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] . at this stage",
    "the maximal energy particles accelerated via dsa at the snr shock reach the fast wind termination shock and are scattered back by magnetic fluctuations carried by the fast stellar wind .",
    "therefore , the high energy particles that have mean free path @xmath2 larger than the distance between the two shocks @xmath3 start to be accelerated by the converging fast flows .",
    "this is the most favorable circumstance for the efficient fermi acceleration .",
    "while the structure of the mhd flow in the vicinity of a supernova shell colliding with the stellar wind termination shock is rather complex , it is possible to consider a simplified model that captures the basic features of the acceleration process .",
    "when the magnetic field fluctuations are strong enough to provide the so - called bohm diffusion regime with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle momentum , @xmath6 is the particle gyroradius in the mean magnetic field and @xmath7 1 , the high energy particles bouncing between the converging flows are likely to have a spectrum harder than that produced at an individual shock and may contain a sizeable fraction of the total kinetic energy of the converging mhd flows .",
    "thus , we formulate a simplified nonlinear approach to account for the effect of the flow modification by the pressure of accelerated crs .",
    "we consider the system evolution stage when radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the two shocks are much larger than the distance @xmath3 justifying a local one - dimensional approach .    in   [ feb ]",
    "we generalize for the case of two shock flows the semi - analytical model originally developed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to account for nonlinear cr modification of a single stationary strong shock flow",
    ". a two shock flow can be stationary in the case of a supersonically moving star with a fast wind . in that case",
    "the bow shock and the termination shock are steady in the rest frame of the moving star . on the contrary in the case of a supernova shock approaching the stellar wind termination shock the system is non - steady . therefore to model the system we constructed in   [ time ] a simplified time dependent approach valid for the shocks with fast cr acceleration .",
    "if magnetic field amplification provides the efficient bohm diffusion resulting in fast cr acceleration , one can implement cr - pressure - modified profile of the instant local flow obtained in the semi - analytical solution into the time - dependent cr transport equation .",
    "consider a model describing a population of high energy cr particles with @xmath10 in a vicinity of two approaching shocks with @xmath11 .",
    "for simplicity and the sake of brevity we will obtain here the solution for the shocks with the same parameters ( velocity profile and hydrodynamic quantities ) but this model can be easily generalized .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we illustrate a simplified scheme of the local flow with two approaching shocks . at @xmath12",
    "there is the upstream region of the shock @xmath13 and at @xmath14 there is the upstream region of the shock @xmath15 .",
    "shock fronts are situated at the @xmath16 and @xmath17 positions and the cr free escape boundaries ( febs ) are at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the cr feb condition requires that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a stationary cr distribution function . to derive the distribution function at the shock in the case of the two colliding shock fronts",
