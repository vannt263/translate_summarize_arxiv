    "the transport of elongated particles or microorganisms by a confined flow is relevant to many industrial applications and natural phenomena .",
    "this is for instance the case in bioengineering or enhanced oil recovery processes or in the build - up and structuration of biofilms in flow channels .",
    "we are interested in the present work in the instabilities of the motion of single elongated particles ( here cylinders ) free to move in viscous flows .",
    "the characteristic dimensions of the particles are comparable to those of the section of the flow channels so that confinement influence very strongly their transport and the occurrence of instabilities .",
    "this study is therefore relevant for instance , to the transport of fibers or long bio - particles in micro - fluidic channels or in porous and fractured media .",
    "previous studies in such flow configurations dealt frequently with the prediction or measurement of the hydrodynamic forces on static cylinders submitted to a flow between parallel plates or in a rectangular channel  @xcite .",
    "investigations of moving cylinders in such geometries were often restricted to stable motions  @xcite ; studies of flow instabilities in these geometries dealt mostly with vortex shedding behind fixed cylinders between parallel walls  @xcite .",
    "finally , instabilities occurring during the sedimentation of different types of objects in a viscous fluid were mostly analysed when no confinement effects were present  @xcite .",
    "periodic fluttering - like motions have also been studied on plates falling in air , but also without considering the effect of confinement  @xcite .    regarding the present configuration , two previous papers reported experiments and @xmath10 numerical simulations of the motion of a tethered  @xcite or free @xcite horizontal cylinder of diameter @xmath0 inside a parallelepiped hele - shaw cell where a vertical poiseuille flow of velocity @xmath2 is established .",
    "transverse oscillations of the cylinder in the aperture @xmath4 of the cell are observed both when the cylinder is tethered and when it can move freely across as well as in the plane of the cell .",
    "moreover , in this latter case , the cylinder displays , in addition , oscillations of its rolling angle about its axis and of its vertical position at frequencies respectively equal to and twice that of the transverse oscillations .",
    "an important feature is that , in both cases , these oscillations have been observed at reynolds numbers @xmath13 as low as @xmath14 : this is well below the threshold value generally reported by other authors for vortex shedding in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "this suggests that one deals with a mechanism different from those associated to the destabilization of the wake of fixed bodies .",
    "the instability observed here can not appear if the cylinder is fixed : it involves likely a feedback effect originating in the variations of the pressure and viscous forces induced by the motion of the cylinder .    in these previous studies",
    "the flow was either exactly ( simulations )  @xcite or approximately ( experiments )  @xcite two dimensional in the whole cell : in the experiments , the length @xmath1 of the cylinder was indeed nearly equal to the width @xmath3 of the cell ( experiments ) and only cases in which the cylinder remained horizontal were studied .",
    "the present work studies instead the influence of the length @xmath1 ( @xmath15 ) on the instabilities ; it also deals both with oscillations modes transverse to the cell aperture and with fluttering modes in which the cylinder does not remain horizontal .    after identifying the different flow regimes ,",
    "one studies the influence of the ratio @xmath6 on the instability over the range @xmath16 : as @xmath6 becomes smaller , the influence of the bypass flow between the ends of the cylinder and the sides of the cell becomes larger .",

    "one studies finally the fluttering motion of the cylinder in the plane of the cell which appears at large values of @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 : the motion of the cylinder displays then periodic variations of the angle of the cylinder with respect to horizontal and oscillatory displacements parallel to its axis .",

    "the displacement of the cylinder is monitored by a digital camera viewing the hele shaw cell from the front : its resolution is @xmath40 pixels and the frame rate @xmath41 . in order to analyze the motion of the cylinder , its length is divided into @xmath42 parts : the two outside ones are painted in black while black staggered stripes parallel to the axis are painted on the central portions .",
    "processing digitally the images provides first the location of the ends of the cylinder by detecting the ends of the outer stripes : from these data one determines then the coordinates @xmath43 of the center of mass of the cylinder and its angle @xmath44 with respect to the horizontal . as observed previously  @xcite , oscillations of the cylinder transverse to the walls of the cell",

    "<S> the different types of instabilities of free cylinders ( diameter @xmath0 , length @xmath1 ) have been studied in a viscous flow ( velocity @xmath2 ) between parallel vertical walls of horizontal width @xmath3 at a distance @xmath4 : the influence of the confinement parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath5 increases , there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the axis with respect to the horizontal . </S>",
    "<S> the two types of oscillations may be superimposed in the transition domain . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath7 of the transverse oscillations is independent of the lateral confinement @xmath6 in the range : @xmath8 for a given cylinder velocity @xmath9 and increases only weakly with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are accounted for by assuming a @xmath10 local flow over the cylinder with a characteristic velocity independent of @xmath6 for a given @xmath9 value . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values of @xmath7 are also independent of the transverse confinement @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath11 of the fluttering motion is significantly lower than @xmath7 : @xmath11 is also nearly independent of the cylinder diameter and of the flow velocity but decreases significantly as @xmath6 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the fluttering instability is then rather a @xmath12 phenomenon involving the full length of the cylinder and the clearance between its ends and the side walls . </S>"
