    "producing numerical approximations , via monte carlo simulations , to the expected value of functionals involving stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) stopped at a boundary is pervasive in scientific computing .",
    "usually , the quantities of interest are the mean first passage time of a walker from that domain @xcite or the pointwise solution of a boundary value problem ( bvp ) @xcite . some relevant fields where it encounters application are : biology @xcite , barrier problems in finance @xcite , mixing of fluids @xcite and analysis of noisy dynamical systems @xcite  where the interest often lies on first exit times , as well as medical imaging , chemistry @xcite , design of integrated circuits @xcite , and high - performance supercomputing @xcite  more focused on the connection to bvps . it is well known that the convergence rate with respect to the timestep @xmath0 of the approximation to the expected value  the weak convergence rate of the numerical scheme  is only @xmath1 , unless specific measures to handle the interaction between the diffusion random path and the boundary are undertaken @xcite .",
    "this compares very unfavourably with the case of diffusions in free space , where even the most basic method  namely euler - maruyamas  has a weak order @xmath3 . in the last two decades",
    ", a number of weak schemes for bounded diffusions have been put forward seeking to raise the weak convergence rate to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to a scheme with @xmath6 as a `` higher - order scheme '' .",
    "( we will use both terms `` scheme '' and `` integrator '' interchangeably . )    in applications , such a low exponent as @xmath7 means that in order to bound the total error by a tolerance @xmath8 , a very small @xmath0 is needed , which leads to a cost @xmath9 @xcite and so to unpractically lengthy simulations if good accuracy is sought for .",
    "this exponent stems from the need to balance the statistical ( monte carlo ) error with the weak order of convergence of the integrator ( i.e. the bias ) .",
    "in fact , the exponent can be split as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the contribution of either factor .",
    "consequently , raising @xmath13 to @xmath14 means that the cost drops to @xmath15 . in order to reduce it further , a suitable variance reduction method ( tackling the @xmath16 in the exponent ) and/or a @xmath17",
    "are required .",
    "giles multilevel method @xcite is the algorithm of choice for variance reduction , and has truly revolutionized the field of stochastic simulation . in it , several versions of the same stochastic paths  solved at ever smaller values of @xmath0are combined into a telescopic estimator of the expected value in such a way that the rougher versions serve as control variates for the finer ones , thus reducing the overall variance .",
    "importantly , within the multilevel loop the trajectories are numerically integrated with a legacy scheme such as those considered in this article .",
    "the multilevel method was first extended to stopped diffusions in @xcite using the euler - maruyama scheme as integrator , achieving a simulation cost of @xmath18 .",
    "this has been recently reduced down to @xmath19 in @xcite , by improving the convergence rate of the variance to linear and replacing the euler - maruyama integrator by the gobet - menozzi one .",
    "the difficulty of combining multilevel with a given integrator lies in the analysis of the variance , which depends on the _ strong _ convergence properties of the integrator . in any case , the _ weak _ order of convergence of the multilevel estimator is that of the integrator inside it .",
    "moreover , the multilevel error estimate ( see @xcite ) also relies on that weak order being known in advance  as it is the case whenever the sde is to be solved to within a given tolerance @xmath8",
    ".    for unbounded diffusions , there exist superlinear weak integrators .",
    "moreover , talay - tubaro extrapolation can be used , also combined with multilevel . on the other hand , while there are no superlinear integrators for bounded sdes ( to the authors best knowledge ) , extrapolation could in principle still be used @xcite . as a related idea ,",
    "linear regression was used in @xcite to substantially reduce the bias of bounded sdes . but",
    "again , all those strategies critically depend on the prior knowledge of the integrator s order @xmath13 .    given the importance of this topic , it may be surprising that no systematic comparison of such higher - order schemes has been carried out before ( as far as we know ) .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "a second aim is to identify , and hopefully clarify , the specific implementation issues with each specific integrator .    for the sake of conciseness",
    ", this paper is restricted to autonomous bounded diffusions stopped at the boundary .",
    "( we recall that , with killed diffusions , one is interested in finding out whether or not the process has hit the boundary  typically , a barrier  within some time interval . on the other hand , with stopped diffusions ,",
    "the exact hitting point is relevant , too . ) in section ( [ s : representation ] ) , this problem will be explicitly connected with the pointwise solution of elliptic boundary value problems ( bvps ) with dirichlet boundary conditions ( bcs ) . in general , the schemes that we review here can very easily be adapted to time - dependent , bounded sdes ( related , in turn , to parabolic bvps with dirichlet bcs ) . on the other hand ,",
    "bounded sdes reflected on the boundary require the approximation of the local time on the reflecting boundary , for which a different machinery is required @xcite .",
    "( for the sake of completeness , we just point out that those sdes are related to bvps with neumann and robin bcs . )",
    "moreover , we have chosen to review only higher - order integrators which are of _ general purpose_. by this , we mean that they are not restricted , by construction , to particular regular geometries or sdes .",
    "for instance , the method of choice to solve laplace s equation with monte carlo is the walk on spheres @xcite , which takes full advantage of the isotropy of the diffusion . particularizing to convex polyhedric domains , the walk on rectangles algorithm @xcite is preferable , for it deals efficiently with corners .",
    "these two methods can be extended to slightly more complex sdes , such as those having gradient and potential terms with constant coefficients .",
    "other methods for isotropic sdes are : exponential timestepping @xcite , designed for parabolic boundaries ; and the adaptive method in @xcite , which may be the best option if they have localized features such as boundary singularities .",
    "finally , mair and his collaborators have developed an accurate technique for dealing with the boundaries based on `` randomization '' of the bcs @xcite , which has been successfully used in applications , like .",
    "randomization can also be applied to transmission bcs @xcite .",
    "most of the previous methods can be adapted to reflecting bcs .",
    "based on the general - purpose criterion , we have included the following integrators into the survey : brownian bridge @xcite , buchmann and petersen s @xcite , gobet and menozzi s , and two methods by milstein .",
    "the first three are based on the euler - maruyama method , which is also included as a reference . as a matter of fact",
    ", the method of buchmann and petersen is restricted to diagonal diffusions , but given its excellent performance with high - dimensional poisson s equations , we have included it nonetheless .    for stopped ( as well as for killed ) bounded diffusions , the reason for the lower weak rate of convergence compared to diffusions in free space is the ambiguity in determining the _ first _ intersection with a boundary of a random polygonal path  the numerical approximation to the diffusion under timestep @xmath0 .",
    "see figure [ i : figura1 ] ( left ) .",
    "the most natural way of approximating that first intersection is taking some point between the last iteration inside and the first interation outside .",
    "unfortunately , not only does this result in a weak rate @xmath20 , but also leads to a systematic _ overestimation _ of the mean first exit time . in order to fix both issues , missed excursions such as in figure [ i : figura1 ] ( left ) must be taken into account . in the literature ,",
    "three approaches have been proposed :    * compute the probability that an excursion took place during every discrete step inside and terminate accordingly ( used in the brownian bridge and in the related method by buchmann and petersen ) . *",
    "make up for the missed first exits by shrinking the domain ( boundary shift method by gobet and menozzi ) .",
    "* control the step length at every step in order to make sure that the trajectory either stays within the domain , or touches its boundary exactly at one known point ( methods of bounded increments by milstein ) .",
    "missed by the coarser time discretization between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "right : tangent ellipsoid with a given orientation .",
    "the absorption layer ( of width @xmath23 ) is highlighted ( see section [ ss : woe ] ) .",
    "]    in order to actually enjoy a higher order of convergence , the integrators need that the sde coefficients or the integration domain meet some regularity conditions , which applications often lack . on the other hand , it is interesting to check how the various higher - order methods fare precisely in that situation . therefore , we have made a point of including both kind of domains ( those very smooth and those with corners ) in our comparison .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : representation ] , the precise connection between autonomous sdes stopped at the boundary and linear elliptic bvps with dirichlet bcs is made .",
    "we have put together the common aspects to all of the integrators in section [ s : preliminaries ] .",
    "then , the five methods singled out in the introduction are reviewed in section [ s : integrators ] .",
    "the test problems are presented in section [ s : experiments ] , and section [ s : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
