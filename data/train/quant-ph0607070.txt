    "one of the key concepts in both classical and quantum information theory is the _ capacity of a channel_. that is , the maximal number of bits  or qubits  that can be transmitted reliably per use of the channel . in the classical world shannon s seminal coding theorem enables us to determine the capacity of every classical channel .",
    "however , for the coherent transmission of quantum information through a quantum channel no comparable coding theorem is known .    in this work",
    "we determine the _ quantum capacity _ for channels which arise from interactions between a system and an effectively small environment .",
    "physically , these channels could correspond to the dephasing of an electron spin in a quantum dot , the spontaneous emission in a two - level atom or the loss of a photon in an optical fiber .",
    "we will provide a capacity formula based on the _ coherent information _ for all cases where system and environment are qubits .",
    "this includes in particular all extremal qubit channels , i.e. , those into which any qubit channel can be decomposed . for larger systems we find a similar result if only the coupling to the environment is sufficiently small .",
    "note that the size of the environment which matters in this context is not the physical one , but the effective size given by a minimal representation of the channel .",
    "along the way we find instances of channels with larger environment to which the results can be extended .",
    "moreover , we show that additivity of the quantum capacity implies its convexity so that upper bounds on the quantum capacity of channels with unconstrained environment can be obtained from mixing channels with small environment",
    ".    we will start by introducing the basic tools and notions , then derive the capacity formula in the qubit case and finally treat systems of higher dimension .",
    "consider a quantum system characterized by a density operator @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "every quantum channel @xmath2 can be represented by a unitary coupling to an environment which is initially in a pure state @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "alternatively we can write any channel as @xmath6 where the _ kraus operators _ @xmath7 fulfill @xmath8 .",
    "the _ conjugate channel _",
    "$ ] is defined as a mapping from the system ( which is traced out in the end ) to the environment .",
    "its kraus operators are given by @xmath10 @xcite .    the _ quantum capacity _",
    "@xmath11 is the maximal asymptotically achievable rate at which we can reliably transmit quantum information  measured in number of qubits  through a channel ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "a major theoretical step was the proof of the _ capacity theorem _",
    "@xcite stating that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called _ coherent information _ and @xmath14 $ ] is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the evaluation of the expression in eq.([qreg ] ) is a daunting task .",
    "first , the regularization @xmath15 appears to be generally necessary since there are channels for which the maximized coherent information is non - additive @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath16 is in general not concave in @xmath0 allowing for a complex landscape of local maxima which are not global ones .",
    "we will show in the following that for the considered channels with small environment these two obstacles can , however , be avoided so that the calculation of @xmath11 becomes a feasible task .",
    "the main tool behind is the concept of _ degradability _ of a channel introduced by devetak and shor @xcite .",
    "a channel is called _ degradable _ if it can simulate its conjugate in the sense that there is another channel @xmath17 which composed with @xmath2 yields @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , we call it _",
    "anti - degradable _ if the conjugate @xmath19 is degradable .",
    "the importance of this property stems from the fact that the coherent information then becomes a conditional entropy @xcite which is in turn sub - additive and concave .",
    "in other words , for a set of degradable channels @xmath20 one has @xmath21 for which local maxima are already global ones . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath2 is anti - degradable then the no - cloning theorem implies @xmath22 .",
    "channels which are known to be ( anti-)degradable are lossy bosonic channels @xcite , channels with diagonal kraus operators @xcite and qubit amplitude damping channels @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss how to check whether a channel is ( anti-)degradable . to this end consider the generic case where @xmath2 is invertible .",
    "then degradability is equivalent to complete positivity of @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , anti - degradability is related to complete positivity of @xmath24 . to express this in a more convenient form we exploit jamiolkowski s operator - map duality @xcite which assigns a bipartite operator @xmath25 to each channel @xmath2 by sending half of a ( unnormalized ) maximally entangled state @xmath26 through @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , we can assign to each channel a _ transfer matrix _",
    "@xmath27 which is obtained via the involution @xmath28 .",
    "the advantage of these two representations is that complete positivity of @xmath2 reduces to @xmath29 and concatenating and inverting channels boils down to matrix multiplication and matrix inversion on the level of @xmath27 .",
    "hence , checking degradability becomes equivalent to verifying positivity of the eigenvalues of @xmath30^\\gamma\\geq 0\\;.\\ ] ] likewise , anti - degradability amounts to positivity of @xmath31 and if both @xmath32 then @xmath2 and @xmath33 are unitarily equivalent .",
    "we will now apply these tools to channels with small environment .",
    "consider qubit channels with a qubit environment , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "we will first show that every such channel is either degradable or anti - degradable , then derive a capacity formula and finally sketch the application of the result to arbitrary qubit channels .",
    "the latter will be based on a general convexity property for the quantum capacity .    to start with we utilize that two channels have the same capacity if they differ merely by unitaries acting on input and output .",
    "building equivalence classes in this way reduces the number of parameters to two ( @xmath35 ) and allows us ( following @xcite ) to represent every such channel by kraus operators in the normal form @xmath36 for @xmath37 this represents a _ dephasing channel _ @xcite and for @xmath38 an _ amplitude damping channel _ @xcite . as the set of invertible channels @xmath2 ( and conjugates @xmath19 ) is dense , it is sufficient to consider the invertible case ",
    "the general statement will then follow from continuity @xcite .",
    "we denote the spectra which we have to check according to eq.([degcond ] ) by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the reason for the two - dimensional null space will become clear below eq.([h ] ) . straight forward",
    "algebra shows that @xmath41 as @xmath17 and @xmath24 are trace preserving we have that @xmath42 so that in both cases at most one of the eigenvalues can be negative . together with eq.([lambdas ] ) this implies that _ either _ @xmath43 _ or _ @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the capacity @xmath11 is zero iff @xmath45 and given by the supremum of the coherent information otherwise . in order to evaluate the latter we note that the chosen representation in eq.([a2 ] ) has the property of being covariant w.r.t .",
    "a @xmath46 pauli rotation : @xmath47 together with eq.([j ] ) and the concavity of the coherent information for degradable channels this implies that @xmath48 hence , diagonal input states maximize the coherent information and joining pieces then yields the capacity formula ( see fig.1 ) in the region of non - zero capacity ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50}\\;h\\big(p \\cos^2\\alpha + ( 1-p ) \\sin^2\\beta\\big)\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\   - h\\big(p \\sin^2\\alpha + ( 1-p ) \\sin^2\\beta\\big)\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the binary entropy function .",
    "this extends the findings of @xcite to arbitrary qubit channels with two kraus operators .",
    "there are several ways of exploiting this result for qubit channels with unconstrained environment .",
    "first , for any composition @xmath52 of channels @xmath20 with known capacity we can make use of the bottleneck inequality @xmath53 .",
    "second , we can consider convex combinations @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , _ every _ qubit channel can be convexly decomposed into channels with @xmath56 , as it was proven in @xcite that every extremal qubit channel can be represented by kraus operators in the normal form of eq.([a2 ] ) . in order to apply this",
    "we need the following .",
    "the general behavior of the quantum capacity under mixing of channels is not known  a problem reminiscent of a long - standing question in the theory of entanglement distillation @xcite .",
    "however , one can easily show that additivity @xmath57 implies convexity @xmath58 . to see this we start from eq.([qreg ] )",
    "applied to a convex combination @xmath59 : @xmath60 where the inequality reflects convexity of the coherent information w.r.t .",
    "the channel and the last step follows from the additivity hypothesis together with the summation of the binomial series .",
    "note that the required additivity of @xmath61 on tensor powers is already implied by the simple additivity @xmath62 @xcite . since the quantum capacity is additive on degradable ( resp .",
    "anti - degradable ) channels , it is also convex on these sets .",
    "that is , if we decompose a qubit channel ( now with unconstrained environment ) into degradable extremal channels , we get a simple upper bound on its capacity by exploiting convexity together with eq.([qformula ] ) .",
    "moreover , if a channel admits a convex decomposition into extremal channels with zero capacity ( i.e. , anti - degradable ones ) , then it also has vanishing capacity .",
    "we will now investigate channels acting on higher dimensional quantum systems .",
    "our aim is to prove that a channel in any dimension is degradable if it arises from a sufficiently small coupling to a qubit environment .",
    "this will follow from a more general result on channels which we call _ twisted diagonal _ and for which @xmath63 .    consider a completely positive map @xmath64 acting on a @xmath1 dimensional system with a @xmath65 dimensional environment . we will call @xmath2 _ twisted diagonal _",
    "if there exist invertible matrices @xmath66 such that @xmath67 is diagonal with diagonal entries @xmath68 , @xmath69 and associated normalized vectors @xmath70 .",
    "related to these maps we introduce a hermitian @xmath71 matrix @xmath72 with matrix elements @xmath73_{kl}/\\langle\\psi_k|\\psi_l\\rangle$ ] and show that the positivity @xmath74 is equivalent to degradability of @xmath2 . to this end denote by @xmath75 the completely positive maps with one kraus operator @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "for degradability we have to check complete positivity of @xmath78 .",
    "this is , however , equivalent to @xmath79 being completely positive , where the twisted diagonal property now allows us to easily compute the inverse .",
    "the jamiolkowski operator @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath81 can then be derived in a straight forward way and has the form @xmath82 is a set of orthonormal vectors , @xmath72 and @xmath80 have the same non - zero spectrum . hence , @xmath83 iff @xmath2 is degradable . moreover , in the special case of diagonal channels for which @xmath84 we get @xmath85 recovering the result of @xcite that all diagonal channels are degradable .",
    "the next step in our argumentation is to show that _ all _ channels with @xmath56 are twisted diagonal .",
    "more precisely , the set of kraus operators @xmath86 for which there exist invertible matrices @xmath87 such that @xmath88 is diagonal , is dense . to see this consider the polar decomposition @xmath89 and choose @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this maps @xmath92 and @xmath93 so that we only have to choose @xmath94 such that it diagonalizes the remaining part .    for channels arising from coupling a @xmath1-dimensional system to a qubit environment we can thus resort to the degradability criterion @xmath83 . in order to complete the argumentation we note that @xmath85 for the ideal channel as well as for all unitary evolutions of the system .",
    "as @xmath72 is continuous under varying the channel , it will remain positive ( and the channel thus degradable ) for a sufficiently small coupling to a qubit environment .",
    "hence , for all these channels one can efficiently compute the quantum capacity .",
    "one might wonder how large this set of degradable channels is .",
    "clearly , for @xmath95 these are exactly half of the channels  the other half is anti - degradable .",
    "sampling channels according to the haar measure gives that 10% ( 1% ) of the channels remain degradable for @xmath96 .",
    "in summary we showed that the quantum capacity can be calculated for many channels arising from coupling a system to an effectively small environment .",
    "this in particular completes the picture in the case where both system and environment are qubits  analogous to the gaussian bosonic situation @xcite where both are characterized by a single mode .",
    "the results are based on the _ degradability _ of the considered channels .",
    "this property fails to be true in general for larger environment  even in the vicinity of the ideal channel @xcite .",
    "however , one can use the shown convexity property of the channel capacity ( or that of recently proposed assisted versions @xcite ) in order to derive upper bounds .",
