    "it has been mentioned already by gell - mann and pais @xcite that rigorous conservation of c parity should be expected only in the absence of external fields .",
    "indeed , ortho - positronium ( o - ps ) @xmath233=0 substate ( which may decay only via o - ps @xmath234 channels in vacuum ) obtains quantum admixture of para - ps ( @xmath25 ) state in the magnetic field .",
    "in such situation , ( @xmath22 ) bound state with @xmath235 quantum numbers can decay into @xmath236 pairs , which leads to experimentally observed @xcite `` magnetic field quenching '' of ortho - ps @xmath237 decays .",

    "for example , @xmath257 substate of @xmath258 meson ( decaying to @xmath259 channel in 82% of cases ) may disintegrate via much faster @xmath260 ( gluons ) channel in the magnetic field , which can shorten the lifetime of @xmath261 mesons considerably @xcite and also suppress the amount of @xmath262 decays .",
    "however , in this contribution we would like to discuss another consequence of the above mentioned quantum mixing phenomenon : in the magnetic field , para - positronium @xmath25 state acquires admixture of o - ps(@xmath263 substate .",
    "this is not very interesting in positronium case , because lifetime ratio @xmath264 results in very small influence @xcite of the magnetic field on para - ps decays ( possibility to decay via @xmath237 channel does not influence significantly quantum state which can decay via @xmath265 `` fast '' channel by default ) .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath11 and @xmath266 mesons , the ratio of lifetimes is opposite @xmath267 , which means that @xmath268 admixture of @xmath269 meson in @xmath270 superposition ( @xmath25 ) state introduces @xmath271 contamination from @xmath269 decays @xcite .",

    "this may occur only if `` g '' parity violation is significant ( @xmath279 , @xmath280 decays can not occur when g parity is conserved ) .",

    "it has been established that @xmath285 states of ortho - positronium acquire admixture from @xmath286 ( @xmath22 ) states ( these correspond to @xmath287 ) mesons in the case of charmonium ) .",
    "for example , eigenstate @xmath288 with @xmath289 quantum numbers of the hamiltonian containing the interaction term for external electric fields is @xmath290 where parameters @xmath291 depend on `` hyperfine '' energy splittings @xmath292 between @xmath293 and @xmath294 mesons .",
