    "absorption bands of h@xmath3o and ch@xmath1 dominate the ir spectra of dwarfs cooler than @xmath41400k and are a backbone of the t dwarf classification schemes defined by geballe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and burgasser et al .",
    "accurate and complete opacity data for these molecules are thus essential for modelling the atmospheres of t dwarfs . we have updated the phoenix model atmosphere code with a new methane list based on theoretical calculations with the spherical top data system ( stds ) ( wenger & champion 1998 ) . compared to our ames - cond models ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ) , with @xmath437000 ch@xmath1 lines from the hitran and geisa databases , this has added 1.2@xmath5 lines ( homeier et al .",
    "we have computed opacity sampling spectra in the limiting case of fully settled dust clouds as described in allard et al .",
    "the main difference in the line lists is a much larger set of faint lines , mostly due to a coverage in rotational quantum number extending up to @xmath2=40 , as compared to typically @xmath610 in the hitran and geisa data .",
    "we discuss the changes in these models on the case of the t4.5 dwarf sdss0207 + 00 observed by geballe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . as can be seen in the absorption feature around 2.2@xmath7 m ,",
    "rotational levels up to about @xmath2=30 need to be included to reproduce the band shape over its full width .",
    "less evident in the spectra is the dense background of faint lines at higher @xmath2 , which effectively closes any windows of small opacity throughout all of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "this results in a stronger redistribution of flux towards shorter wavelengths , and thus a brightening of the @xmath2 band of about 05 compared to an ames - cond model with the same parameters .",
    "we note that the colors can be `` fixed '' with lower log@xmath10 models in the ames - cond grid , but at the cost of an even worse spectral fit in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "we could significantly improve our synthetic ir spectra for t dwarfs with the new stds line list for methane .",
    "in addition , the new models produce a shift of emergent flux towards the @xmath2 band due to stronger blanketing , reproducing well the blue ir colors of t dwarfs . to clarify the exact role of the onset of ch@xmath1 in the rapid brightening in @xmath2 observed at the l - t transition ,",
    "a new set of models will be necessary that also provides a consistent treatment of the settling of the cloud layer below the photosphere expected to occur in about the same temperature range ( allard et al .",
