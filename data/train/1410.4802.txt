    "cancer dormancy , the phenomena that the tumor s volume or the number of tumor cells stays at a very low level for a certain period of time before the tumor begins to grow rapidly , has been an outstanding issue in cancer research for many years @xcite . currently , the mechanisms responsible for the `` switch '' from a dormant state to a rapid growth state for different tumors are not well understood , although it is well known that such a `` switch '' in secondary metastatic tumors can be triggered by the removal of the primary tumor .",
    "this could eventually lead to failure of tumor treatment and fatal outcomes for the patient .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive understanding of the `` switch '' from a dormant to a proliferative state is crucial to our fundamental understanding of cancer progression and recurrence and might lead to the development of novel treatments for cancer .",
    "dormancy has been observed in many types of cancer .",
    "this includes tumor dormancy before any metastases take place and the latency of cancer recurrence after therapy . in some cases of pancreatic cancer , the tumor can remain in a benign dormant state for about 20 years @xcite . during this time , it is undetectable by conventional clinical methods , and it is only afterwards that the tumor becomes highly malignant and grows aggressively with highly fatal outcomes after about a year . in the cases of breast and prostate cancer , it is reported that @xmath0-@xmath1 of patients will relapse years or decades later after the resection of the primary tumor @xcite .",
    "in addition , recurrence has been observed in brain tumors , which indicates the existence of a large number of micrometastases that are dormant in the presence of the primary tumor @xcite .",
    "extensive studies over years have revealed three major cancer dormancy mechanisms : cellular dormancy , angiogenic dormancy and immunosurveillance @xcite . on the cellular level",
    ", a tumor cell could be arrested at a certain stage of the cell cycle and unable to complete the cell division process successfully , resulting in a dormant solitary cell @xcite .",
    "on the cell population level , when the population does not gain enough ability to recruit blood vessels and promote neovascularization , the tumor can not obtain sufficient nutrients necessary for its proliferation and as a result , angiogenic dormancy occurs @xcite . on other hand",
    ", immunosurveillance operates when the immune system suppresses the proliferation of tumor cell population and leads to the dormancy of the tumor @xcite . figure [ fig_exp_img](a ) shows an image of tumor tissue surrounded by immune cells .",
    "figure [ fig_exp_img](b ) compares the morphology and vascular structure of dormant and fast - growing tumors .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of cancer dormancy and the `` switch '' from a dormant to a proliferative state still needs to be strengthened .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that efficient and accurate experimental or clinical approaches to track the states of individual cells in a dormant tumor _ in vivo _ throughout the entire dormancy period are still under development @xcite .",
    "given the current need for further understanding of dormancy , computational modeling provides a powerful means to probe various scenarios for the underlying mechanisms .",
    "specifically , modeling enables one to probe a variety of different dormancy scenarios by examining different combinations of mechanisms in order to see which ones provide possible explanations for experimental and clinical observations . over the past few decades",
    ", computational modeling has played an important role in the study of the progression of solid tumors @xcite ; a variety of models based on different mathematical schemes have been developed , including continuum models @xcite , discrete cell models @xcite and hybrid models @xcite .",
    "various models have been used to investigate cancer dormancy caused by cancer - immune interactions and other mechanisms , including ordinary differential equation - based models @xcite , stochastic differential equation - based models @xcite , models based on kinetic theory for active particles @xcite , and cellular automaton models @xcite .",
    "however , the aforementioned studies neither explicitly demonstrated how the dynamic process of active proliferation after a certain period of dormancy emerges from various microscopic mechanisms nor showed the associated growth dynamics of the `` switch '' phenomenon .",
    "therefore , predictive computational models that incorporate cellular - level microscopic mechanisms are needed to address these important issues .    in this paper , we generalize a two - dimensional ( 2d ) cellular automaton ( ca ) model that we have devised to study proliferative growth of avascular solid tumors @xcite in order to investigate tumor dormancy .",
    "our goal is to formulate a dynamical model in which the `` switch '' to a proliferative state spontaneously emerges by incorporating additional interactions between the tumor and the microenvironment , for example the effects of immune system , which were not included in our previous ca model .",
    "the new rules of our ca model induce a `` competition '' between the tumor s propensity to proliferate and the microenvironmental factors that suppress its growth .",
    "in our model , a fraction of the dormant cells undergo phenotypic transformations triggered by intracellular factors or external stimulus and acquire the ability to actively proliferate .",
    "subsequently , those microenvironmental factors act to suppress the growth of these transformed tumor cells either by killing some of these cells or turning these actively dividing proliferative cells back into dormant cells",
    ".    the `` competition '' between the tumor and the microenvironmental suppression factors either results in a `` stalemate '' for a period of time in which the tumor either eventually wins ( spontaneously emerges ) or is eradicated ; or it leads to a situation in which the tumor is eradicated before such a `` stalemate '' could ever develop .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the situations in which tumor growth involves a period of dormancy , we will henceforth focus on those situations in which a `` stalemate '' between the tumor and the microenvironmental suppression factors develops .",
    "our model demonstrates that a variety of parameters characterizing the tumor - host interactions may greatly alter the growth dynamics of the tumor .",
    "these parameters include the rate of phenotypic transformation , by which the tumor cells gain the ability to proliferate against those suppression factors , the suppression rate imposed by suppression factors on individual tumor cells , and the mechanical rigidity of the microenvironment .",
    "the growth dynamics influenced by these parameters include the existence of a dormant period in tumor s growth , the length of the dormant period ( if there exists one ) and the existence of a sudden `` switch '' to a highly proliferative state .",
    "we also demonstrate that if the number of actively dividing cells within the proliferative rim reaches a critical , yet low level , the tumor has a high probability to begin rapid proliferation .",
    "while we study a 2d ca model for simplicity in this paper , our model can be easily generalized to three dimensions ( 3d ) .",

    "we divide the two - dimensional square simulation box into different polygonal units ( i.e. , automaton cells ) .",
    "our model is coarse - grained , allowing us to grow the tumor from a very small size with a cross section of roughly 1000 real cells through to a fully developed tumor with a cross section consisting of @xmath3 cells .",
    "specifically , the innermost automaton cells represent roughly 100 real tumor cells or or a region of host microenvironment of similar size , while the outermost automaton cells represent roughly @xmath4 real tumor cells or a region of host microenvironment of similar size . to generate the automaton cells in the simulation box , we first fill the simulation box with non - overlapping circular disks ( or spheres in 3d ) using random - sequential - addition packing method @xcite until there is no void space left for additional circular disks ( or spheres in 3d ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used for generating the packing .",
    "then we divide the simulation box into polygons ( or polyhedra in 3d ) , each polygon ( or polyhedron in 3d ) associated with a particle center , such that any point within a polygon ( or polyhedron in 3d ) [ i.e. , a voronoi polygon ( or polyhedron in 3d ) ] is closer to its associated particle center than to any other particle centers . the resulting voronoi polygons ( or polyhedra in 3d )",
    "are referred to as automaton cells . in this paper , we focus on the two - dimensional case , but our model should be readily generalized to three dimensions .    the microenvironment surrounding a tumor is mainly composed of stroma cells and extracellular matrix ( ecm ) . in the current model , we explicitly take into account the effects of the ecm macromolecule density , ecm degradation by the proliferative cells , and the pressure built up due to the ecm deformation by tumor growth .",
    "the effects of the stroma cells are not explicitly considered in our current model .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to the regions of microenvironment as ecm - associated cells for simplicity .",
    "in addition , we consider the interactions between the tumor and the various suppression factors in the microenvironment , for example the immune system . since we consider development of primary tumor or local recurrences of micrometastases under microenvironmental suppression , invasive tumor growth is not a mechanism relevant for our purposes and hence is not included in our dormancy model .    in our model of noninvasive proliferative tumor growth",
    ", tumor cells can be in one of the three possible states : proliferative , quiescent or necrotic , depending on their nutrient supply .",
    "proliferative cells are tumor cells that have enough nutrients and possess the ability to divide . quiescent ( or arrested )",
    "cells are tumor cells that are alive , but do not have enough nutrient supply to support cell division .",
    "quiescent cells can eventually become inert , necrotic ( dead ) cells due to an insufficient nutrient supply . in this paper , we focus on avascular tumor growth and assume that there is no explicit angiogenesis during the growth process ( although this assumption can be relaxed ) . the nutrients available to tumor cells are those that diffuse into the tumor region through tumor edge .",
    "as the tumor grows , the amount of nutrient supply , which is proportional to the perimeter of the tumor interface ( or surface area of the tumor interface in 3d ) , can not meet the needs of all of the tumor cells . as a result ,",
    "quiescent and necrotic regions emerge near the center of the tumor .",
    "the state of a tumor cell is determined by its distance to the tumor edge ( i.e. , the source of nutrients ) .",
    "we assume that proliferative cells more than @xmath5 away from the tumor edge become quiescent and quiescent cells more than @xmath6 away from the tumor edge become necrotic ( see details below ) .    in this section",
    ", we will introduce our ca dormancy model , which modifies our previous basic ca models of tumor growth @xcite by introducing several additional parameters to incorporate the interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironmental suppression factors .",
    "this dynamical model is capable of producing situations in which a `` switch '' from a dormant state to a proliferative state spontaneously emerges .",
    "we now specify the cellular automaton rules used in our model for noninvasive proliferative tumor growth .",
    "each ecm - associated automaton cell is assigned a specific density @xmath7 , representing the density of the ecm molecules within the automaton cell .",
    "if a proliferative cell divides , its daughter cell occupies a nearby ecm - associated cell .",
    "the daughter cell pushes away or degrades the ecm within the ecm - associated cell it occupies .",
    "initially , a tumor is introduced by designating several automaton cells at the center of the growth permitting region as proliferative tumor cells .",
    "then time is discretized into units , with each time step representing one day . at each time step",
    ", the tumor grows according to the following cellular automaton rules .    *",
    "quiescent cells more than a certain distance @xmath8 from the tumor s edge are turned necrotic .",
    "the tumor s edge , which is assumed to be the source of nutrients , consists of all ecm - associated cells that border the tumor .",
    "the critical distance @xmath8 for quiescent cells to turn necrotic is computed as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the necrotic thickness controlled by nutritional needs , @xmath11 is the euclidean spatial dimension and @xmath12 is the distance between the geometric centroid @xmath13 of the tumor ( i.e. , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of cells in the tumor ) and the tumor edge cell that is closest to the quiescent cell under consideration . * proliferative cells more than a certain distance @xmath16 from the tumor s edge are turned quiescent .",
    "the critical distance @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the proliferative thickness controlled by nutritional needs , @xmath11 is the spatial dimension and @xmath12 is the distance between the geometric tumor centroid @xmath13 and the tumor edge cell that is closest to the proliferative cell under consideration . *",
    "the probability of division for a proliferative cell used in our model is @xmath20.\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the base probability of division linked to cell - doubling time , @xmath7 is the local ecm density , @xmath22 is a parameter taking into account the effect of pressure , @xmath23 is the ratio of current average ecm density over the initial density , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the length and width of local protrusion tips .      here , we specify the additional interaction rules between the tumor and the microenvironmental suppression factors beyond the aforementioned ones for noninvasive proliferative growth , which were not included in our previous ca models .",
    "we assume that there are two possible states of proliferative cells , dormant or actively dividing , depending on their interactions with the microenvironmental suppression factors .    *",
    "initially , we assume that all proliferative cells are kept in dormant states by the microenvironmental suppression factors , which means that they are not able to divide . * at each day , beyond the aforementioned ca rules for proliferative noninvasive growth , each dormant proliferative cell has a certain probability @xmath26 to change in their phenotypes due to intracellular factors or external stimulus .",
    "the cell with phenotype change gains different degrees of resistance to the suppression factors in the microenvironment , depending on the specific phenotype change the cell undergoes .",
    "for example , mutated leukaemic cells in acute myeloid leukaemia acquire resistance to cytotoxic t lymphocytes - mediated cell lysis , whose degree is related to the level of the cell s expression of b7-h1 or b7.1 @xcite . for simplicity , we divide the phenotypic changes into two different types : _ weak _ changes and _ strong _ changes with respect to their resistance to the suppression factors in the microenvironment ( i.e. their ability to actively proliferate ) .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to these phenotypic changes as `` transformations '' and the cells that undergo these changes as `` transformed '' cells for simplicity .",
    "strong - type `` transformed '' cells gain a larger competition advantage and thus have a greater ability to divide actively .",
    "the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fractions of weak - type `` transformations '' and strong - type `` transformations '' . henceforth , we set @xmath27 0.99 and @xmath28 0.01 . * at each subsequent day , the microenvironmental suppression factors will counteract the weak - type `` transformed '' and strong - type `` transformed '' cells with probabilities @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the suppression factors in the microenvironment will either kill the `` transformed '' cells or turn them back into dormant cells @xcite . * when the number of tumor cells reaches a certain threshold @xmath31 , strong reactions of the microenvironmental factors are triggered and those factors start to kill the `` transformed '' cells .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is introduced to ensure that the tumor is not completely removed by the microenvironmental suppression factors .",
    "note that the particular choice of @xmath31 barely has any effect on the simulation results within a relatively wide range of @xmath31 values .",
    "in this work @xmath31 is set to be 50 , a sufficiently small value that leads to biophysically realistic outcomes .",
    "as the tumor grows , the microenvironmental factors are weakened by the tumor , resulting in weaker suppression of the tumor cells @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the microenvironmental factors counteract the `` transformed '' cells , the fraction of the cells that are killed can be coupled with the growth rate of the tumor by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant characterizing the strength of the suppression factors in the microenvironment , @xmath34 is the daily area change of the tumor ( i.e. the growth rate of the tumor ) , and @xmath35 is the critical value of the tumor s growth rate . in this work , @xmath35 is chosen as half of the tumor s maximum growth rate under suppression , but our numerical tests have revealed that the simulation results are insensitive to the choice of @xmath35 as long as @xmath35 is smaller than the tumor s maximum growth rate . when the growth rate of the tumor reaches this critical value , the suppression factors become too weak to kill any actively dividing tumor cells and @xmath36 is set to be 0 @xcite . * due to the `` competition '' between the tumor and the suppression factors in the microenvironment , the ratio of the number of actively dividing proliferative cells over the total number of proliferative cells @xmath37 changes with time .",
    "the larger is this ratio @xmath37 , the larger is the amount of nutrients the tumor tissue consumes . as a result ,",

    "besides the aforementioned influences , our findings informed by clinical data might be able to provide further insights to novel early cancer detection and therapy .",
    "for example , a new cancer drug that suppresses the emission of cd47 by the tumor tissues , which helps the tumor cells evade attack by the immune system , has been discovered @xcite .",
    "it was shown via _ in vitro _",
    "experiments that this drug is able to kill a variety of cancer cell types .",
    "thus , an effective clinical application of this drug depends upon the ability to identify different tumor cell populations while they are dormant . our work may serve to provide insights to the application of this new drug as well by contributing to the development of new early detection methods .",
    "in addition , our work may shed light on why the immune system may not always be able to prevent tumor progression .",
    "specifically , our work shows that even if the immune system maintains its strength throughout the tumor growth process , there is still a high possibility that the immune system could eventually fail , which is to be contrasted with the simple explanations that it becomes weaker as the tumor develops @xcite .",
    "also , for a tumor of a specific type , we can extract the parameter values in our model by fitting our simulation results to the statistics of a real in - vitro or in - vivo tumor of this type .",
    "then we can utilize our model to explore optimal treatment strategies for the tumors of this specific type .",
    "in addition , once we determine the effects of a specific microenvironmental factor ( e.g. , specific integrins @xcite ) on the parameter values in our model , we could then study the effects of this microenvironmental factor on the tumor growth dynamics .",
    "our current ca dormancy model is still preliminary , and to achieve our ultimate goal of understanding cancer dormancy and progression , we need to develop robust models that incorporate appropriate cell - level tumor - host interactions that are informed by experiments .",
    "for example , by explicitly considering angiogenesis and using more realistic distribution of `` transformed '' tumor cells resistance to microenvironmental suppression factors ( currently we just divide the `` transformed '' cells into two types with respect to their resistance to microenvironmental suppression factors : _ weak _ and _ strong _ ) , our model might be able to yield more realistic results and improve our understanding of cancer dormancy and progression .",
    "also , the effects of tumor cell competition , cooperation and the microenvironmental changes caused by tumor cell activities could be incorporated to further strengthen our ca dormancy model @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that although we employ interaction rules based on a discrete cell model to describe `` competition '' between the tumor and the microenvironmental suppression factors , alternatives such as evolutionary game theory implemented by partial - differential equations are also available to address the interplay between the tumor and the microenvironment @xcite .",

    "<S> our new ca rules induce a natural `` competition '' between the tumor and tumor suppression factors in the microenvironment . </S>",
    "<S> this competition either results in a `` stalemate '' for a period of time in which the tumor either eventually wins ( spontaneously emerges ) or is eradicated ; or it leads to a situation in which the tumor is eradicated before such a `` stalemate '' could ever develop . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict that if the number of actively dividing cells within the proliferative rim of the tumor reaches a critical , yet low level , the dormant tumor has a high probability to resume rapid growth . </S>",
