    "the main aim of colliding heavy nuclei at relativistic energies is to create a hot and/or dense thermal phase of matter where the quarks and gluons are not confined inside hadrons but move within nuclear volume .",
    "such a phase of matter is called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the detection of qgp in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) at rhic and lhc energies is one of the most challenging jobs both for experimentalists and theorists working in this field primarily because of the extremely transient nature of the qgp .",
    "the qgp evolves dynamically in space and time due to high internal pressure , due to which the system cools and reverts to hadronic matter .",
    "the electromagnetically interacting particles , photons and dileptons  @xcite(see  @xcite for review ) are considered to be penetrating probes of the matter formed in the collisions of heavy ions at relativistic energies because ( i ) they are produced at each space - time point of the system and ( ii ) their mean - free paths are much larger than the system - size and hence bring the information of the production points very efficiently .",
    "the efficiency of photons for being considered as an competent probe of qgp largely depends on the ability to disentangle the photons produced from various stages of evolution of the system formed in hic .",
    "therefore , first we identify the possible sources of photons above those coming from the decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons etc , as provided by the data because photons from these decays are already eliminated and hence need not be considered in the present analysis .",
    "photons produced from the evolving matter under consideration are :    \\(i ) due to the initial hard collisions of the partons from the nucleons of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this contribution may be estimated by using the techniques of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and the data from pp collisions may be used to validate such calculations .",
    "the @xmath2 distributions of photons from proton+proton ( pp ) collisions at a given energy can be used as a benchmark for the hard contribution in hic .",
    "therefore , estimation of these contributions with minimal model dependence is important . in view of this , in the present analysis we estimate the hight @xmath2 contributions in hic by using the experimental data obtained in pp collisions  @xcite as described in section iii .",
    "( ii ) photons are also produced from the interactions of the _ ` yet - to - be equilibrated ' _",
    "partons i.e. from the time span between the collision point and the onset of thermalization . in case where the thermalization time scale is very small the contributions from this interval will be insignificant and hence can be neglected .",
    "\\(iii ) thermal photons originating from the interactions of the ( a ) quarks and gluons in the bath and ( b ) thermal hadrons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 etc ) .",
    "the estimation of the thermal contribution depends on the space - time evolution scenario that one considers . in case of a deconfinement phase transition , which seems to be plausible at rhic energies ( see  @xcite for a review ) , one assumes that qgp is formed initially .",
    "the equilibrated plasma then expands , cools , and reverts to hadronic matter and finally freezes out at a temperature , @xmath7 , called freeze - out temperature .",
    "evidently there will be thermal radiation from qgp as well as from the luminous hadronic fireball which has to be estimated as accurately as possible in order to have a reliable estimate of the initial temperature .",
    "the momentum distributions of photons ( and dileptons ) produced from a thermal system depend on the temperature ( @xmath8 ) of the source through the thermal phase space factors of the participants of the reactions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) spectra of photon reflects the temperature of the source . for an expanding system",
    "the situation is , however , far more complex .",
    "the thermal phase space factor changes - by several factors _",
    "e.g. _ the transverse kick received by low @xmath2 photons due to flow originating from the low temperature hadronic phase ( realized when @xmath9 ) populates the high @xmath2 part of the spectra  @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the intermediate or the high @xmath2 part of the spectra contains contributions from both qgp as well as hadrons .",
    "the photon spectra measured experimentally represents the space - time integrated yield from the matter that evolves from an initial hot and dense phase to a comparatively cooler and diluted phase of hadronic gas .",
    "therefore , the temperature extracted from such spectra will exhibit the average temperature of the system .",
    "the experimental data on the @xmath2 distributions of photons from various collision energies and colliding systems have been analyzed by using different kinds of models  @xcite mainly to extract the temperature of the hot phase formed after the collisions . in the present work",
    "the slope of the photon spectra has been used to estimate the enhancements of the effective degeneracy with increased multiplicity .",
    "the slope of dilepton spectra for different invariant mass windows have been used to extract the average radial flow velocity of the high temperature phase .    in the next section",
    "we very briefly describe the various mechanisms of photon and lepton pair productions .",
    "section ii is dedicated a compressed description of the space - time dynamics of the system .",
    "the results are presented in section iii and section iv is devoted to summary and discussions .      the emission of thermal photons and lepton pairs from qgp and thermal hadrons have been discussed in earlier works . in the present work we briefly outline various processes for the emissions and refer to the literature for the details .",
    "the rate of thermal photon production per unit space - time volume per unit four momentum volume is given by  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the imaginary part of the retarded photon self energy and @xmath12 is the thermal phase space distribution for bosons . for an expanding system ,",
    "the energy @xmath13 should replaced by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the four momentum and the hydrodynamic four velocity respectively .",
    "the hard thermal loop  @xcite approximations has been used by several authors  @xcite to evaluate the photon spectra originating from the interactions of thermal quarks and gluons .",
    "the complete calculation of emission rate of photons from qgp to order o@xmath17 has been done by resuming ladder diagrams in the effective theory  @xcite , which has been used in the present work .",
    "a set of hadronic reactions with all possible isospin combinations have been considered for the production of photons  @xcite from hadronic matter .",
    "the effect of hadronic dipole form factors has been taken into account in the present work as in  @xcite .",
    "the dominant source of the thermal dileptons from qgp is the @xmath18 annihilation  @xcite . for the low mass dilepton production from hm the decays of thermal light vector mesons namely @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath19",
    "have been considered .",
    "the change of spectral function of @xmath4 due to its interaction with @xmath20 ( see  @xcite for details ) and baryons  @xcite have been included in evaluation of lepton pairs from hm . for the spectral function @xmath5 the width at non - zero temperature is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and no medium effect has been considered for @xmath19 .",

    "the space time evolution of the system formed in pb+pb collisions at @xmath21 tev has been studied by using relativistic hydrodynamics with longitudinal boost invariance  @xcite and cylindrical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the system reaches the state of equilibrium at a time @xmath22 after the collision . the initial temperature , @xmath23 can be related to the measured hadronic multiplicity ( @xmath24 ) by the following relation for system undergoing isentropic expansion : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radius of colliding nuclei",

    "we have used @xmath40 and @xmath41 at @xmath422.76 tev .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the values of @xmath24 ( through @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] ) and hence the @xmath23 ( through @xmath24 in eq .  [ eq4 ] ) depend on the centrality of the collisions .",
    "the values of @xmath26 for a given centrality has been evaluated by using the relation - @xmath45 .",
    "we use the lattice qcd eos  @xcite for the qgp phase and hadronic resonance gas eos for the hadronic phase  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic freeze out temperature , @xmath46 mev is constrained by the @xmath2 spectra of hadrons",
    ". the ratios of various hadrons measured experimentally at different @xmath47 indicate that the system formed in heavy ion collisions chemically decouple at @xmath48 ) .",
    "therefore , the system remains out of chemical equilibrium from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "the deviation of the system from the chemical equilibrium is taken in to account by introducing chemical potential for each hadronic species  @xcite .",
    "with the increase in multiplicity for different collision energies . ]        the direct photon spectra from pb+pb collisions is measured at @xmath21 tev . however , no data at this collision energy is available for pp interactions .",
    "therefore , prompt photons from p+p collision at @xmath51 tev has been used to estimate the hard contributions for nuclear collisions at @xmath52 tev by using the scaling ( with @xmath53 ) procedure used in  @xcite . for the pb+pb collisions",
    "the result has been scaled up by the number of collisions at this energy ( this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as prompt photons ) .",
    "the high @xmath2 part of the data is reproduced by the prompt contributions reasonably well . at low @xmath2",
    "the hard contributions underestimate the data indicating the presence of a possible thermal source .",
    "the thermal photons with initial temperature @xmath54 mev along with the prompt contributions explain the data well ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , with the inclusion of non - zero chemical potentials for all hadronic species considered  @xcite(see also  @xcite ) .        ]",
    "it is well known that transverse momentum spectra of photons act as a thermometer of the interior of the plasma .",
    "the inverse slope of the thermal distribution is a measure of the average ( over evolution ) effective ( containing flow ) temperature of the system .",
    "we have extracted the average effective temperature ( @xmath55 ) from the thermal distributions of photons at different collision energies - _ i.e. _ for sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
    "fig  [ fig2 ] shows the variation of @xmath56 with multiplicity for different collision energies . to minimize the centrality dependence of the results",
    "the @xmath57 is normalized by @xmath38 .",
    "the results clearly indicate a significant rise in the average @xmath2 ( @xmath58 ) while going from sps to rhic to lhc .",
    "the values of @xmath56 for different collision energies are given in the table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "since photons are emitted from each space time point of the system , therefore , the measured slope of the @xmath2 spectra represents the average effective temperature of the system .",
    "the quantity , @xmath59 ) is proportional to the entropy density .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 , the average effective statistical degeneracy , a quantity which changes drastically if the colour degrees of freedoms deconfined _ i.e. _ if a phase transition takes place in the system .",
    "we find that the entropy density ( @xmath61 ) at lhc increases by almost @xmath62 compared to rhic and there is an enhancement of @xmath63 at rhic compared to sps .",
    "however , part of this increase is due to the increase in the temperature and part is due to increase in degeneracy . to estimate the increase in the degeneracy",
    "we normalize the quantity @xmath64 by @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we estimate @xmath66 from the analysis of the experimental data and found that there is a @xmath67 increase in this quantity from sps to rhic and @xmath68 increase from rhic to lhc .    we evaluate the invariant mass ( @xmath69 ) spectra , and the transverse mass ( @xmath70 ) spectra of lepton pairs with initial conditions , eos etc constrained by the measured photon spectra at @xmath21 tev .",
    "the emission processes from qgp and the hadronic phases are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , therefore , we do not repeat the details here to save space .",
    "the @xmath71 spectra is evaluated for different @xmath69 windows ( @xmath69 ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , with @xmath74 ) .",
    "the @xmath69 spectra displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates that by selecting @xmath72 and @xmath73 appropriately , one can extract the properties of qgp ( @xmath75 gev ) or hadronic system ( @xmath76 , @xmath4 mass ) .",
    "therefore , for example , the slope of the @xmath70 spectra ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) at @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 gev provide information about the average temperature and flow of the qgp and hadronic phases respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the slope of the @xmath70 spectra , @xmath79 for different @xmath69 windows has been plotted . to understand the effect of flow on the slope of the spectra we evaluate the spectra and",
    "hence estimate the slope by switching on and off the radial flow .",
    "the results with ( solid line ) and without ( dashed line ) flow are depicted in fig .",
    "the slope , @xmath79 with flow ( @xmath80 ) may be parametrized as @xmath81 .",
    "the difference in the slope due to non - zero @xmath82 and the observation of the dominance of the qgp phase at large @xmath69 help in estimating the radial flow of the qgp phase .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath83 for @xmath84 gev .",
    "a very small value of 0.065 is justified because the @xmath85 gev range correspond to very early time when flow is not fully developed .",
    "however , for @xmath86 gev we found @xmath87 where qgp phase contributions dominate , indicating the fact that the qgp formed at lhc collision conditions undergo significant radial flow .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath88 for the hadronic phase ( near the @xmath4 peak ) is 0.46",
    ". the value of @xmath88 in the hadronic phase at freeze - out will be more than 0.46 as this is the average value of the hadronic matter .",
    "the @xmath89 for @xmath90 gev where the qgp and the hadronic matter contribute almost equally ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the photon spectra measured by alice collaboration in pb+pb collisions at @xmath21 tev with a view of extracting the properties of thermal system formed in these collisions .",
    "the slope of the photon spectra have been compared with the previously measured spectra at super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies .",
    "the thermal lepton pair spectra from the pb+pb collision at lhc energy has been estimated with the same initial condition that is used to reproduce the thermal photon spectra at the same collision conditions .",
    "the increase in the effective statistical degeneracy at rhic and lhc relative to sps have been estimated from the slope of the photon spectra .",
    "the radial flow velocity of the qgp and hadronic phases have been assessed from the invariant mass and transverse momentum distributions of the lepton pairs . as the data from alice collaboration is well reproduced by the sources of photons described above , photons from other sources _",
    "e. g. _ due to jet - thermal parton interactions  @xcite and induced emissions by the hard partons due to multiple interactions in the qgp  @xcite are ignored in the present analysis .",
