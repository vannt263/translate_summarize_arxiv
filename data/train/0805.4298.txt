    "microcavity polaritons  @xcite are the quasi - particles which result from strong light - matter coupling in semiconductor microcavities .",
    "the light polariton mass means a weakly interacting dilute bose gas picture would imply a high transition temperature  @xcite and , even with more sophisticated methods  @xcite , the expected transition temperature is @xmath0 times higher than for atomic gases .",
    "while bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of atomic gases are now routinely studied , condensation of microcavity polaritons has been long sought  @xcite and only recently has a thermal equilibrium condensate accompanied by spontaneous coherence been realized in a cdte microcavity  @xcite . in the same structure",
    "the polarisation has been investigated@xcite , second order temporal coherence has been studied@xcite , and pinned vortices have been observed in the condensed phase  @xcite .",
    "spontaneous coherence of microcavity polaritons has been also recently investigated in gaas  @xcite , while there have been early reports on room temperature polariton lasing in a gan cavity  @xcite .",
    "microcavity polaritons are interacting particles in a disordered potential with internal structure and finite lifetime , which form a finite two - dimensional gas , so their condensation differs from that of ideal non - interacting three - dimensional ( 3d ) bosons for which bec was originally discussed .",
    "it is therefore crucial to establish these differences and the nature of polariton condensation . to this end ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare theoretical and experimental results for the phase diagram , and to discuss what they reveal about the nature of the polariton condensate .",
    "we discuss both complete thermal equilibrium phase diagrams , and also consider effects that may result from pumping and decay ( even when the polariton distribution is well thermalised ) . as a further way of illustrating the differences between the ideal 3d bose gas and microcavity polaritons , the condensate fraction as a function of pumping strength is presented ; this is compared qualitatively to a theoretical model including effects of pumping and decay .",
    "we experimentally evaluate the critical density for condensation at low cryostat temperatures in the range @xmath1k and for exciton - photon detunings in the range @xmath2 mev .",
    "these densities are compared with the predictions of a realistic microscopic model that accounts for the composite structure of microcavity polaritons , interactions enhanced by quantum well disorder and finite polariton lifetime .",
    "this comparison reveals two crucial aspects of the current realisation of polariton condensation in cdte : that it lies in the crossover between bec of weakly interacting bosons and the mean - field phase transition driven by interactions ; and that the excitonic disorder is important in the evaluation of the polariton - polariton interactions .",
    "the organisation of the remainder of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec : exper - determ - crit ] describes the experimental estimate of critical density , found by integrating the occupation .",
    "section  [ sec : theor - phase - diagr ] then introduces the theoretical models we consider , and in sec .",

    "[ fig : occup ] . above a threshold pump power , the ground state occupation grows exponentially , while the effective lp temperature , @xmath19 , ( extracted from the tail of the occupation ) does not change much .",
    "this macroscopic occupation of the ground state has been shown to be associated with macroscopic coherence across the spot size  @xcite , demonstrating polariton condensation . at threshold @xmath20k ; this is above @xmath21 because the polariton lifetime ( of @xmath22@xmath23ps ) is shorter than typical relaxation times ( although longer than their thermalization time  @xcite ) .",
    "the ground state occupation at threshold is , within a factor of two , measured to be one ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : occup ] this is rescaled to one .        the lp density at the threshold pump power",
    "can then be estimated by integrating the occupation to give the total density .",
    "the estimate found this way is represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : phas1 ] by blue stars .",
    "since the system is thermalized , by rescaling the occupation at @xmath24 to one , this density estimate is determined by the effective temperature only ; any variation at fixed temperature is due to changes to the lp density of states .",
    "this section discusses the theoretical modelling of the phase diagram , and further methods of estimating the experimentally observed critical density .",
    "the discussion here concerns the thermal equilibrium case ; possible effects of pumping and decay are discussed later in sec .",
    "[ sec : effects - pump - decay ] .",
    "the discussion will compare the use of two models ; the first  model  is a model of disorder localised saturable excitons coupled to propagating photons  @xcite . at low enough densities and temperatures ,",
    "the critical density given by model   will be dominated by long wavelength bosonic fluctuations  @xcite , and so the results of this model can be reproduced by modelling lower polaritons as a weakly interacting dilute bose gas  @xcite , which we shall call model .",
    "excitonic disorder can significantly modify the effective polariton interaction compared to the clean case . to take account of excitonic disorder in model",
    ", we choose the interaction strength for this model so as to match the low density limit of model  , in which excitonic disorder is explicitly considered .",
    "such matching is achieved by calculating the form of blueshift vs density in both models , and choosing the effective interaction strength for the bosonic model so they agree .",
    "this calculation of blueshift vs density also allows a second estimate of the experimentally found critical density , by measuring the blueshift observed at that density .      the first model , following refs .",
    ", starts from the single - particle exciton states ( numerically ) evaluated in a disordered quantum well , as explained further below .",
    "although being 2d , all such states are localised , the nature of the exciton states and their associated oscillator strength change substantially with the exciton energy  @xcite .",
    "the exciton states that couple most strongly to the cavity photons are those just below the band edge .",
    "although the exciton states are localised , polaritons consist of a superposition of many excitons  @xcite and so need not be localised  @xcite .",
    "polaritons in cdte are also localised by photonic disorder , associated with the spatial inhomogeneity observed in the pl above threshold .",
    "however , above threshold , coherence can be observed over a large length scale approaching the excitation spot size  @xcite , and so polaritons could not be localised on a shorter length scale .",
    "this gives an energy scale up to @xmath25mev@xmath26k , much smaller than the observed blue - shift ( due to interaction ) .",
    "this difference in energy scales suggests that localisation is a perturbation to a theory of interacting bosons , rather than vice versa ; we therefore neglect photonic disorder when finding the phase boundary .      in the many body hamiltonian ,",
    "we approximate the interactions between excitons by exclusion : each single - particle exciton state can only be occupied once .",
    "this approximation over - estimates the on - site interaction and neglects the inter - site interaction  in reality there is finite coulomb and exchange energy to multiply occupy the same single exciton states .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .  , this approximation is valid at low enough densities . this procedure yields model , @xmath27 the spin operators @xmath28 describe states @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponding respectively to the presence or absence of an exciton of energy @xmath31 .",
    "the operators @xmath32 describe confined photon modes of energy @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the bare electron mass ) . the quantisation area @xmath36 that appears in eq",
    ".   plays no role in any final answer , and is taken to infinity in all our calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian written in eq",
    ".   does not yet take account of spin of the exciton states or polarisation states of the light . to a first approximation ,",
    "the interaction between different spins is weak ; in such a limit each polarisation behaves separately , and one has independent copies of this model for each spin , thus introducing a degeneracy factor @xmath37 in the total density . beyond this limit ,",
    "opposite spin polarisations are weakly attractive , producing bound excitonic states ; the effect of such an interaction is discussed in appendix  [ sec : inter - betw - spins ] .      as in refs .  , the exciton energies @xmath38 and coupling strengths @xmath39 ( which lead to the inhomogeneous exciton linewidth ) are taken from numerical diagonalisation of exciton wavefunctions in a disorder potential  @xcite .",
    "these numerical calculations are described in detail in ref .",
    ", so we only briefly summarise the method here .",
    "we numerically solve the schrodinger equation in a disorder potential : @xmath40    \\phi_{\\alpha}({{\\mathbf r } } )    =    \\varepsilon_\\alpha \\phi_{\\alpha}({{\\mathbf r}})\\ ; .\\ ] ] we use the cdte exciton mass  @xcite @xmath41 , and a gaussian correlated exciton disorder . for disorder weaker than the exciton binding energy , the internal structure of the exciton smooths disorder on lengthscales shorter than the exciton bohr radius  @xcite @xmath42 ,",
    "so we can consider a gaussian noise correlated on a length scale @xmath43 : @xmath44 we take @xmath45 and so the only free parameter in this calculation is the strength @xmath46 of the disorder ; this was chosen to give an exciton linewidth that matches the observed cdte exciton linewidth ( @xmath47mev ) , leading to @xmath48mev .",
    "the exciton - photon coupling strength involves the overlap between the disorder localised exciton state , and the photon wavefunction .",
    "since the relevant photon momenta are small compared to the typical scales of the exciton wavefunction ( i.e. small compared to @xmath49 ) , we take this coupling strength at zero photon momentum , as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the disorder localised exciton state . to fix the overall scale of the couplings we use rabi splitting @xmath52 with the observed rabi splitting .",
    "thus , the complete set parameters defining model   are the exciton mass , the rabi splitting , the exciton linewidth , the exciton bohr radius and the photon mass .",
    "these parameters all have reasonably well established values , and are not used as fitting parameters .      at low densities and temperatures , the thermodynamics of model is dominated by long wavelength bosonic fluctuations@xcite , and so it gives the same predictions as an effective lp model  @xcite [ model ] : @xmath53 as before , in the absence of biexcitonic effects , the spin degree of freedom only contributes a factor @xmath37 to the density . such a model for the condensation of weakly interacting bosons",
    "is often studied in the context of excitons , and of atomic gases  @xcite . for polaritons ,",
    "model   has been considered  @xcite with the interaction strength @xmath54 taken from a combination of coulomb interaction and the nonlinearity of exciton - photon coupling  @xcite . however , excitonic disorder can significantly enhance polariton - polariton interactions  @xcite and make them larger than those in clean qws .",
    "in choosing the value of @xmath54 we wish to include these effects of disorder , which are described microscopically in model  .",
    "as mentioned above , the form of model   describes the relevant excitations of model   at low densities and temperatures , and so the physical predictions of these two models should match in this limit .",
    "hence , the effect of disorder on the interaction strength can be included by choosing the value of @xmath54 so as to make the results of model and model match at low densities and temperatures .",
    "following the relation between the two models as described above , the value of @xmath55 is chosen so that the blueshift vs density in the normal state calculated in both models will match . in the normal state of model  ,",
    "the lp blue - shift varies linearly with the density @xmath56 . in model",
    "the blue - shift depends on both temperature and disorder , but , in the low density normal state , it also varies approximately linearly ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : blue1 ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath55 so these gradients are the same . in both models ,",
    "once condensed , the lp branch locks to the chemical potential , and so the blue - shift traces the dependence of chemical potential on density , increasing more rapidly then linearly at first , before eventually saturating ( illustrated by the red @xmath57 symbols in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : blue1 ] ) .     symbols ) vs. mean - field density . the experimental lp linewidth ( black dashed ) and threshold ( found from the occupation data ) are also shown .",
    "measured blue - shifts at threshold can be translated to densities as explained in the text . ]",
    "the value found by this procedure is @xmath58 , implying a blue - shift of @xmath59mev at a density of @xmath60 ) .",
    "this effective interaction strength @xmath55 is roughly 10 times that found from coulomb and saturation effects in a clean system  @xcite .",
    "the relative size of inter - site coulomb and saturation effects can also be seen in the up energy shift with pump power : the coulomb term shifts both lp and up in the same direction , saturation effects lead to opposite shifts . experimental data in the on - line supplementary information of ref .",
    "show an up red - shift of magnitude comparable to the lp blue - shift , strongly suggesting that saturation effects dominate coulomb interactions .",
    "the calculation of blue shift as a function of density allows one to extract a second estimate of the lp density at threshold , by converting the experimentally observed blueshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blue1 ] , upper panel ) to the corresponding density .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : blue1 ] , the mean - field estimate of blue - shift differs according to whether one considers the condensed or uncondensed case . since fluctuations beyond the mean - field approximation delay the transition , the actual blue - shift at threshold should lie between the condensed and uncondensed mean - field estimates .",
    "thus , for a given observed blue shift , one can extract two estimates of the density that should bound the actual density .",
    "these two translations to density are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phas1 ] , as red upward triangles for the condensed calculation , and green downward triangles for the uncondensed case .",
    "the experimental estimate of the critical polariton density can be now compared to the theoretical phase diagram . from model  ,",
    "one may derive a mean - field phase diagram , for condensation of polaritons in the lowest energy state .",
    "the mean - field phase boundary@xcite comes from finding the mean - field estimate of density ( @xmath37 takes into account the degeneracy introduced by the excitonic spin ) : @xmath61\\ ; , \\ ] ] at the chemical potential @xmath62 which first satisfies the saddle - point equation ( which plays a role analogous to the self consistency condition or gross - pitaevskii equation for a weakly interacting dilute bose gas ) : @xmath63}{\\varepsilon - \\mu}\\ ; .\\ ] ] this mean - field boundary is shown as a black solid line in fig .  [",
    "fig : phas1 ] .    including fluctuation corrections to this mean - field transition , one recovers a smooth crossover from the mean - field limit at higher densities to a fluctuation dominated regime at low densities  @xcite ; in this fluctuation dominated regime , the results of model are equivalent to those of model .",
    "this crossover is at a temperature that is controlled by rabi splitting , and is of the order of one tenth of the rabi splitting . in 2d , for interacting bosons with a quadratic dispersion , the transition temperature to the superfluid state , the berezhinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt )  @xcite temperature , varies linearly with the density @xmath64 and is close to the quantum degeneracy temperature , @xmath65 .",
    "the results of model are not quite so simple as the dispersion is non - quadratic  @xcite .",
    "however , at ultra - low densities , the phase boundary of model   ( blue dotted - dashed line ) recovers a linear dependence of critical temperature on density ( black dashed line ) .",
    "the bkt transition discussed above describes an infinite two - dimensional system .",
    "the experimental system however contains photonic disorder , which might act as a trapping potential for polaritons . in a non - interacting harmonically trapped two - dimensional bose gas ,",
    "a transition exactly like that described by bose and einstein can exist due to the modification of density of states by the harmonic trap  @xcite .",
    "however , the polariton system is interacting , and it is not a - priori valid to ignore interactions ; the inclusion of interactions in an harmonically trapped system  @xcite can replace the bec transition of the non - interacting gas with a transition better described by bkt physics .",
    "the exact details of the critical behaviour in a trapped two - dimensional interacting system are delicate . as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : local - excit - model ] , for the parameters relevant in the current system , the effects of polariton trapping induced by the photonic disorder are weak compared to the polariton - polariton interaction strength .",
    "however our interest here is in the prediction of the phase boundary , we note that for the parameters relevant here simple estimates of the critical temperature for the bec of non - interacting trapped system do not differ significantly from those for the bkt transition .",
    "there is a quite separate question concerning coherence ( and condensate fraction ) in a two dimensional trapped system , which we discuss below in sec .",
    "[ sec : condensate - fraction ] .     and",
    "@xmath21 , with superimposed the estimates of density from the pl ( blue stars ) and from the blue - shift of lp ( red upper and green lower triangles ) . ]",
    "in fig .  [ fig : phas1 ] the experimental density is near the crossover between the low- and high - density parts of the theoretical phase boundary .",
    "the density estimated from the blue shift is slightly greater than that from integrating the occupation ; however without the effects of excitonic disorder , the density from the blueshift would be ten times higher .",
    "let us consider the possible systematic errors involved in estimating the density . in integrating occupation ,",
    "the sources of uncertainty are the normalisation ( discussed earlier ) , and the accuracy with which the critical pumping power has been determined .",
    "we may underestimate the experimental critical density if the nonlinear threshold we use is in fact associated with the diverging susceptibility on approaching the transition rather than with the condensation transition itself . as an upper bound on this source of uncertainty we note that the density when the linewidth reaches a minimum is between @xmath66 and @xmath23 times that at threshold . for the estimates from the blueshift ,",
    "the uncertainties here are harder to quantify .",
    "the exclusion interaction for excitons may overestimate blueshift , implying our estimated density is too low .",
    "alternatively , our calculation assumes a thermalised polariton distribution , whereas the influence of the exciton reservoir and hot carriers remains unclear within the present modelling , these might increase the blueshift , suggesting that our estimated density is too high .",
    "finally , the theoretical phase boundary as yet neglects dephasing ; it is this effect to which we next turn .",
    "as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : occup ] , and the discussion in ref .",
    ", the polariton distribution is thermalised .",
    "however a thermalised population distribution does not necessarily imply that one can neglect effects  @xcite of pumping and decay . to understand this distinction ,",
    "let us consider two dimensionless ratios that characterise non - equilibrium effects .",
    "one might estimate the effect of pumping and decay by considering the ratio of polariton lifetime to thermalization time ( e.g. , @xmath67 in the current experiment , @xmath68 in early atomic gas  @xcite becs ) .",
    "when this ratio is larger than one , the distribution will be thermalised .",
    "however , even with a thermal polariton distribution , pumping and decay cause a particle flux , introducing dephasing , which increases the critical density at a given temperature  @xcite .",
    "the importance of this dephasing can be estimated by comparing the homogeneous photon linewidth , lw@xmath69mev , to the temperature @xmath70mev .",
    "as these parameters are comparable , linewidths will have significant homogeneous contributions , and dephasing can affect the ability of the system to maintain a coherent state .    as an estimate of how such dephasing would modify critical density at a given temperature , fig .",
    "[ fig : noneq ] compares the phase boundaries found from calculations using model  , but with photon decay and injection of excitons  @xcite taken into account .",
    "these calculations introduce a flux of particles by allowing photons to decay and continually injecting new excitons to maintain a steady state .",
    "the departure from the closed system picture is controlled by two parameters , the photon decay rate @xmath71mev , and a pumping rate @xmath72 that describes coupling between the polariton system and the reservoir of high energy excitons .",
    "the value of @xmath72 is not clearly known , but is bounded . for @xmath73 one has a polariton linewidth larger than the bare photon linewidth ; for @xmath74 there is instability of the homogeneous condensate@xcite ; a range of @xmath72 bounded by these consideration is shown for illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : noneq ]  within these limits , the exact value of @xmath72 does not significantly shift the curves .",
    "although these calculations use model  , for tractability of the nonequilibrium calculations , a gaussian distribution of excitonic energies @xmath38 and a constant coupling @xmath75 , are used .",
    "the main effect of this replacement is that there is no simple relation between the units of density for this calculation and those in the previous figures , hence the arbitrary units in fig .",
    "[ fig : noneq ] .",
    "however , one may note that the form of the equilibrium boundary ( black ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : noneq ] is very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : phas1 ] , and one may thus estimate the size of shift associated with pumping and decay . dephasing shifts the phase boundary to higher densities ; this would reduce the distance between the predicted phase boundary and the critical density estimated from the blueshift .",

    "[ fig : condfrac ] ) with the theoretical quasi - condensate fraction ( evaluated at the mean - field level ) with and without pumping and decay ( fig .",
    "[ fig : noneq ] ) .",
    "although trapping negligably affects the phase boundary ( the properties of the phase boundary being dominated by interactions ) , trapping and finite size are important in allowing a non - zero condensate fraction@xcite .",
    "a quasi - condensate fraction can also be defined for an infinite two - dimensional system ; its definition follows from the behaviour of the off - diagonal one - particle density matrix @xmath79 . in three dimensions",
    "@xmath79 tends to a constant at long distances , which defines off - diagonal long - range order ; in two dimensions it instead decays as a power law .",
    "however , the power law decay is due to phase fluctuations , and by separating the effects of phase fluctuations from the quasi - condensate depletion due to density fluctuations  @xcite one may extract a quasi - condensate density . in a trapped two - dimensional system",
    "there can be a regime near the phase transition in which there is quasi - condensation ; however as temperature is reduced or density increased , coherence will rapidly extend over the entire system@xcite .",
    "thus , apart from a small region near the transition , coherence across the entire system is expected even when the phase transition itself is like the bkt transition .",
    "the experimental condensate fraction is determined from the occupancies illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : condfrac ] as follows : the occupancy shows a clear peak at low momentum ; the experimental estimate of condensate fraction comes from the fraction of polaritons found in this low momentum peak , i.e. the integrated density within the fwhm of the occupancy peak , see ref .   for further details .",
    "the theoretical mean - field estimate is the ratio of the coherent density , @xmath80 to the total ( mean - field ) density of polaritons  @xcite .",
    "there are of course complications in comparing the experimental condensate fraction of a trapped 2d bose gas@xcite to the theoretical mean - field condensate fraction ; however the comparison between the various mean - field estimates clearly shows that pumping and decay are responsible for a reduction of the quasi - condensate fraction .",
    "concluding , we have compared experimental and theoretical phase boundaries for condensation of cdte microcavity polaritons .",
    "the experimental data lie near the crossover between a regime where the transition can adequately be described by condensation of structureless bosons and a mean - field regime where instead the long - range nature of the polariton - polariton interaction determines the boundary .",
    "we were limited to temperatures near this crossover region : because of the short polariton lifetime , the polariton temperature is decoupled from that of the lattice .",
    "there are small differences between the various ways of estimating experimental density ; were one to neglect effects of disorder these differences would have been an order of magnitude larger . however , these estimates of experimental density lie close to the theoretical phase boundary , and considering the effects of pump and decay improves this agreement .",
