    "one - dimensional nanostructures have attracted much attention since they provide potential applications for nanoelectronics and nanophotonics @xcite .",
    "for example , zinc oxide nanorods with hexagonal cross - section can be applied as whispering gallery resonators , in which the coupling between the resonant modes and free excitons depends sensitively on the cross - sectional radius @xcite .",
    "growth of nanorods have been extensively reported thus far , yet there are few studies concentrating on the underlying atomistic mechanisms of growth , especially on the understanding and controlling the cross - sectional radius of nanorods from atomic point of view @xcite .",
    "it is known that surface kinetics plays an important role in determining the morphology and size of nanostructures @xcite .",
    "the deposited adatoms can either diffuse within the topmost layer and aggregate to form a new layer nucleus , or hop downward across the step edges and contribute to the lateral growth of the topmost layer . under a certain deposition condition",
    ", the kinetics - controlled competition between the growth in the normal direction to the substrate and the lateral growth is expected to determine the growth modes and morphologies @xcite .",
    "the surface kinetics can be described by intralayer and interlayer hopping rates of adatoms , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , where the prefactors @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the attempt rates which are approximately of the same value ; @xmath4 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath5 the temperature .",
    "the interlayer diffusion barrier ( @xmath6 ) is normally larger than the intralayer one ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the difference of these two values is denoted as @xmath8 , which is known as ehrlich - schwoebel barrier ( esb ) @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath9 increases with esb as @xmath10 .",
    "the esb is reported to increase with the step height and saturate in several atomic layers , with a value usually referred as three - dimensional ( 3d ) esb .",
    "the conventional esb is applicable for a monolayer step and is hereafter termed as two - dimensional ( 2d ) esb @xcite .    when esb is small enough to allow sufficient inter - layer diffusion ,",
    "layer - by - layer growth occurs , whereas larger esb leads to multilayer growth @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "islands initiate from each nucleus , which approach nanorods if the cross - sections remain the same along the longitudinal direction . the key point to select and control",
    "the nanorod growth is to understand how the radius of the cross - section varies when atomic layers add up under specific growth conditions .",
    "since there is a large difference between the 2d- and 3d- esbs , it is also crucial to identify the specific roles of 2d- and 3d - esbs in the nanorod growth .    in this paper",
    ", we study the influence of deposition rate and esb on the growth process of nanorods .",
    "a characteristic radius has been identified , which increases proportional to one fifth power of the ratio of the 2d - esb limited hopping rate of adatoms to the deposition rate .",
    "both the growth modes and the nanorod diameter can be selected by tuning this characteristic radius .",
    "we demonstrate that when the radius of the initial island is larger than the characteristic radius , the growth morphology evolves from a taper - like structure to a nanorod with radius equal to the characteristic radius .",
    "however , if the characteristic radius becomes larger than the radius of the initial island , by increasing the 2d - esb limited hopping rate or decreasing the deposition rate , nanorod morphology can be maintained during the growth , with a stable radius being limited by both the radius of the initial island and 3d - esb .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the characteristic radius are demonstrated with experimental observations of zno growth , and good consistency has been found .",
    "let us consider a nanostructure with thickness of @xmath11 atomic layers . for simplicity",
    ", the cross section is taken as circular .",
    "the radius of the @xmath12-th layer is denoted as @xmath13 , measured in terms of the surface cell parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the dimensionless area and perimeter are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .    assuming the growth units are deposited in the normal direction of the surface , at rate @xmath17 per surface cell of area @xmath18 .",
    "the number of adatom @xmath19 per surface cell is determined by the diffusion euqation , @xmath20 . by solving the diffusion equation ,",
    "the distribution of the number density of adatom can be obtained , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dimensionless number density of adatom at the edge of @xmath23 . before nucleation occurs on top of @xmath23 , a deposited adatom on @xmath24",
    "has no other choice but to hop across the step edges after a survival time of @xmath25 . at steady state ,",
    "the number of atoms leaving the surface per unit time , @xmath26 , is balanced by that of the atoms deposited on the surface per unit time , @xmath27 .",
    "it gives the number density of adatom on the boundary , @xmath28 the total number of adatom on @xmath23 can be obtained by integrating , @xmath29 the average survival time of an adatom is thus @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the time interval between subsequent deposition events on @xmath24 .",
    "in addition to @xmath32 and @xmath25 , another concerned time scale is the traversal time for an atom to visit all the sites of @xmath24 , @xmath33 .    as @xmath23 grows , the probability of nucleation on @xmath23 increases .",
    "once a new nucleus forms on @xmath23 , the number of atomic layers @xmath11 increases by one , which leads to the growth in the normal direction to the substrate .",
    "for the simplest case that a dimer is the smallest stable island , the nucleation rate on @xmath23 can be given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the probability that an atom is deposited during the presence of another atom on the surface , and @xmath36 is the encounter probability @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that with slow deposition the total number of adatoms is usually much less than unity , @xmath37 @xmath38 , which means that @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in typical island growth with large esb , @xmath9 is much larger than dimensionless @xmath40 , so the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) is much smaller than the second term , and the number density of adatom on @xmath23 is approximately uniform , @xmath41 . the total number of adatom becomes @xmath42 , which gives @xmath43 it indicates that @xmath44 when @xmath45 , and the encounter probability of two adatoms simultaneously present on the island @xmath46 is approximately unity .",
    "the nucleation rate therefore can be approximated as @xmath47 depending on the height of the steps across which the adatoms hop to the lower layer , 2d - esb or 3d - esb plays the role to influence the interlayer atomic diffusion , respectively .",
    "correspondingly subscripts @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be added to @xmath50 or @xmath51 in the context to show such a difference .",
    "for a buried layer , @xmath37 the atomic layer above which a second layer has formed , the condition @xmath44 means that an adatom can always be trapped by the ascending steps before getting chance to hop to the lower layer .",
    "the adatoms on @xmath23 before second - layer nucleation , however , has no other choice but to hop to @xmath52 .",
    "the lateral growth of the topmost layer @xmath23 is thus contributed by the atoms deposited on area @xmath52 , @xmath53 we assume for the moment that @xmath52 is large enough so that @xmath23 is always smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "the probability @xmath54 that a second layer has nucleated on @xmath23 , according to @xmath55 , increases with @xmath23 as the following , @xmath56 where @xmath57 can be regarded as the average number of nucleus on @xmath24 . substituting eqs .",

    "as @xmath63 is determined just by the 2d - esb and the growth conditions , such as the deposition rate and the growth temperature , it can be regarded as a characteristic radius of the growth system . in heterogeneous growth",
    ", it is known that the effect of the foreign substrate on surface kinetics properties depends strongly on the thickness of the grown layers .",
    "the interlayer hopping rate @xmath70 is therefore variable , especially in the first two layers .",

    "@xmath71 and @xmath63 are defined as the characteristic radius before and after changing the growth conditions respectively , @xmath73 and @xmath75 correspond to the radius of the topmost two layers at the moment that a nucleus forms on @xmath75 after changing the growth conditions .    two growth scenarios can be identified according to the way that the characteristic radius changes .",
    "the first scenario occurs when @xmath59 decreases from @xmath71 , @xmath37 , @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 , it is still larger than @xmath63 .",
    "thus the third layer forms atop when @xmath80 approaches @xmath81 .",

( [ eq : rn2d ] ) indicates that @xmath13 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath12 , until it approaches @xmath63 . correspondingly , the growth morphology changes from a tapered one to a nanorod in several transient layers , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "obviously this is merely a limiting case in which some strong screening effects exist so that the topmost layer dominates the deeper layers in capturing the deposit atoms @xcite .",
    "the opposite limiting case is that in which the growth units are equally deposited on the exposed area , thus the buried layers can also grow . in the latter case island growth",
    "leads to the well - known wedding - cake morphology @xcite .",
    "the realistic situation is that between these two cases , in which only some finite topmost layers are involved in capturing the deposit atoms as a result of a mediate screening effect . to illustrate the screening effect on the island growth , we consider that only the topmost finite @xmath84 layers keep growing laterally . the quantity @xmath85 , which is in the range of @xmath86 to @xmath87 ,",
    "can be taken as a measure of the _ screening strength_. we have carried out numerical calculations of the rate equations with different values of @xmath84 , the details of which will be reported elsewhere .",

    "the number of the transient layers is proportional to @xmath95 , with coefficient @xmath96 of the order of magnitude of @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore show that , under a certain screening strength , wedding - cake morphologies ( @xmath98 ) , tapered morphologies ( @xmath99 ) and nanorods ( @xmath100 ) can be observed successively during the island growth .",
    "it is thus clear that if the radius of the initial island @xmath76 , the structure finally approaches a nanorod with a tapered base beneath .",
    "the _ screening strength _ only influences the number of the transient layers of convergence , @xmath37 , the atomic layers of the tapered base .",
