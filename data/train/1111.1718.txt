    "the structural evolution of disc galaxies and its timescale remain as open questions nowadays . in fact",
    ", it is still not clear if the formation of bulges is mostly driven by external processes , such as interactions or mergers , or by the internal secular evolution due to inflow of gas from the galactic disc to the central regions , where it may trigger star formation .",
    "this second scenario implies a slow process that takes place when non - axysimmetric components ( particularly bars ) redistribute the angular momentum of the galaxy .",
    "given the large number of barred galaxies found in the local universe , and that the bar fraction remains significant till z@xmath11 , it seems that internal secular processes might actually be an important driver of the evolution in spirals .",
    "if this is the case , the resulting kinematical and morphological changes could also lead to an evolution along the hubble sequence from later to earlier types , as suggested by .",
    "it has been theoretically demonstrated that the flow of gas through a single bar stops before reaching the galactic centre ; however , a system of nested bars may efficiently transport the material to the nuclear regions , where it even would help to fuel nuclear activity .",
    "this idea was first proposed by @xcite , and resulted in an increasing interest in galaxies hosting two or more bars .",
    "double - barred galaxies are common objects in the local universe ; at least one third of barred galaxies show an additional inner bar and nested bars have been found till _",
    "_ z__@xmath10.15 @xcite .",
    "photometric studies have shown that the two bars are randomly oriented relative to each other , suggesting that they rotate independently , as predicted by numerical simulations @xcite and confirmed by observations @xcite . moreover",
    ", it seems there is no correlation between the presence of an inner bar and the hubble type of the host galaxy or its main bar properties .",
    "@xcite find that inner bars extend to @xmath112% of the outer bar size , and that have in general smaller ellipticities , but may be larger since the inner bar might be embedded in the light of the bulge .",
    "@xcite study the dynamics of double - barred objects and develop a simple formalism to study the orbits of their stars based on the _ loop _ concept .",
    "single bars are characterized by two fundamental frequencies ( one for the bar and one for the free oscillations ) , allowing the existence of closed and periodic orbits .",
    "in fact , two orbital families stand out for a single - barred potential : the _ x@xmath2 _ orbits , elongated along the bar major axis , and the _ x@xmath3 _",
    "orbits , perpendicular to it .",
    "a double - barred potential needs an additional frequency to be described , meaning that closed orbits are not possible .",
    "a loop is a family of orbits whose populating particles return to the same curve when the two bars recover the relative position between them , although each individual particle is not in its initial position .",
    "this means that only the global shape of the orbit is preserved .",
    "the challenge of building long - lived double bars led to many numerical simulations , most of them getting galaxies where the outer bar appears first , the gas flows along it and then it is captured by the _ x@xmath3 _ orbits of the main bar , subsequently forming the inner bar . in this scenario",
    "the dissipative component plays a major role .",
    "however , some authors get double - barred systems without such a dissipational process .",
    "this is the case of @xcite , who perform collisionless n - body simulations and obtain purely stellar inner bars .",
    "these inner bars form before the apparition of the outer bars .",
    "finally , @xcite generate for the first time a two bar system from a dark matter halo . in this case , both bars are gas - rich and transport material to the central regions , supporting the hypothesis of @xcite .    with these pieces of evidence ,",
    "it is clear that double - barred galaxies are the perfect benchmark to constrain the role of secular processes within galaxy nuclei .",
    "one way to proceed is to perform a detailed stellar population analysis of these systems : if double bars are playing a major role in galaxy evolution , this fact will be reflected in the properties ( star formation , age , and metallicity ) of the galaxy components ( bulge , inner bar , outer bar , and disc ) , resulting in a gradient of ages and metallicities between them .",
    "however , this is difficult to achieve due to the structural complexity of galaxies with nested bars , as illustrated by the photometric properties mentioned above . to date , there are few stellar population studies involving double bars , all of them being projects devoted to the analysis of samples of barred galaxies in general , which include only some double - barred objects .",
    "for this reason , these works focus only on the main bar and they do not account for the inner bar . this is the case in the set of papers by , , and @xcite , who study the stellar populations of bars and bulges . they find positive , negative , and even null metallicity gradients along the bars independently of the age distribution .",
    "the bulges hosted in barred galaxies tend to be more metal - rich than those in unbarred galaxies at a similar velocity dispersion .",
    "however , the implications of these results within evolutionary scenarios is still unclear .    other works study double - barred objects from a purely kinematical point of view . @xcite",
    "present the 2d stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps for a sample of four double - barred galaxies , based on observations with the sauron integral field spectrograph .",
    "the analysis of high quality velocity dispersion maps revealed two local minima , located exactly at the ends of the inner bar of each galaxy . by means of numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite conclude that these _ @xmath4-hollows _ appear because of the strong contrast between the velocity dispersions of the bulge and the inner bar .",
    "this result indicates that bars are dynamically cold components , with velocity dispersion values significantly lower than those of the hot , classical bulge .",
    "moreover , the @xmath4-hollows are the kinematical signature of the presence of an inner bar .    in this paper , we present the first detailed morphological , kinematical and stellar population analysis of the different structures that comprise a double - barred galaxy : bulge , inner bar and outer bar .",
    "we focus on the case of ngc357 .",
    "the work is organised as follows : in section [ sec : thegalaxy ] we list the relevant properties of ngc357 from the literature , while in section [ sec : obs ] we summarise the observations and the data reduction procedure .",
    "then , we describe the morphology and kinematical profiles in sections [ sec : mor ] and [ sec : kin ] , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : sp ] details the stellar population analysis , from the emission lines correction of the spectra to the detailed study of the bulge region and the comparison between structural components . a discussion of the implications of these results for the structure and possible formation scenarios of ngc357 can be found in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : con ] sets out the main conclusions of this work .",
    "ngc357 is classified as sb(r)0/a by @xcite and as sba by @xcite .",
    "this galaxy appears in the catalogue of double - barred galaxies of , who provides information about the properties of the main and the inner bar of ngc357 , based on the analysis of infrared images from the hubble space telescope .",
    "the two bars of ngc357 are almost perpendicular , with the inner one almost parallel to the major axis of the galaxy , as seen in figure [ fig : ima ] .",
    "we have specifically chosen this early - type spiral in order to avoid the presence of complex structural components and dust , which can make the stellar population analysis very tricky .",
    "the galaxy distance is 31.6 mpc , which corresponds to @xmath1150 pcarcsec@xmath5 .",
    "the relevant properties of ngc357 are shown in table [ tab : n357 ] .",

    "although some studies claim this galaxy is isolated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite finds it belongs to a group with at least six other members .",
    "however , it shows no signatures of interaction with its closer companions .",
    "ngc357 is classified as a liner @xcite .",
    "the structural properties of ngc357 have been studied photometrically by several authors . in this way , perform a photometric decomposition of an _ i_-band image of this galaxy along its outer bar major axis , getting the main photometric parameters of its structural components , namely bulge , outer bar and disc ; they do not take into account the inner bar since its contribution to the radial surface brightness along the main bar is negligible .",
    "their main conclusion is that the bulge of ngc357 follows the same fundamental plane than the ellipticals and other bulges of s0 galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of ngc357 were carried out with the 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) in la silla ( chile ) on 5 - 13 october 2002 . the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) was operated both in blue ( blmd ) and red medium - dispersion spectroscopic ( remd ) mode .",
    "the ntt mounted emmi in blmd using the grating no.3 blazed at 3800   with 1200 groovesmm@xmath5 in first order in combination with a 1.3 arcsec @xmath9 5.5 arcmin slit .",
    "the detector was the no.31 tektronix tk1024 eb ccd with @xmath10 pixels of @xmath11 @xmath12m@xmath13 .",
    "it yielded a wavelength coverage between about 3990   and 4440  with a reciprocal dispersion of 0.45  pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the spatial scale was 0.37 arcsecpixel@xmath5 .",
    "the instrumental resolution was 1.3  ( fwhm ) corresponding to @xmath14 km s@xmath5 .",
    "six spectra of 45 min each were taken aligning the slit with the major axis of the inner bar ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "two more spectra of 45 min each were obtained aligning the slit with the major axis of the outer bar ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "all the spectra were obtained using the guiding tv camera to center the slit on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the ntt mounted emmi in remd using the grating no.6 blazed at 5200   with 1200 grooves mm@xmath5 in first order .",
    "a 1.0 arcsec @xmath9 5.5 arcmin slit was adopted .",
    "the mosaiced mit / ll ccds no.62 and 63 with @xmath17 pixels of @xmath18 @xmath12m@xmath13 covered the wavelength range between about 4800  and 5460 .",
    "the on - chip @xmath19 pixel binning provided a reciprocal dispersion and spatial scale of 0.40  pixel@xmath5 and 0.332 arcsec pixel@xmath5 . the instrumental resolution was 1.6  ( fwhm ) corresponding to @xmath20 km s@xmath5 .",
    "after centering the slit on the galaxy nucleus , two spectra of 30 min each were obtained along the disc major axis ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the range of the seeing fwhm during the observing runs was 0.6 - 1.4 arcsec as measured by the eso differential image motion monitor .",
    "a comparison lamp exposure was obtained after each object integration to allow accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "quartz lamp and twilight sky flatfields were used to remove pixel - to - pixel variations and large - scale illumination patterns .",
    "several g and k stars and spectrophotometric standard stars were observed with the same set - up to serve as templates in measuring the stellar kinematics and in flux calibration , respectively .",
    "all the spectra were overscan and bias subtracted , flatfield corrected , corrected for bad pixels and columns , and wavelength calibrated using standard iraf routines . the cosmic ray removal is a critical step since any residual might affect the spectral lines measured to derive the properties of the stellar populations .",
    "it was performed with the reduceme package @xcite , that assures a careful and accurate inspection and interpolation of the spectra .",
    "we checked that the wavelength rebinning was done properly by computing the difference between the measured and predicted wavelengths @xcite for the brightest night - sky emission lines in the observed spectral ranges .",
    "the resulting accuracy in the wavelength calibration is better than 5 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the spectra taken along the same axis were co - added using the centre of the stellar continuum as reference .",
    "the contribution of the sky was determined from the outermost regions at the two edges of the resulting spectra , where the galaxy light was negligible , and then subtracted , giving a sky subtraction better than 1% .",
    "a one - dimensional sky - subtracted spectrum was obtained for each kinematical template star .",
    "the sky - subtracted spectra were flux calibrated using the observed spectrophotometric stars as a reference .",
    "neither extinction nor dust corrections were applied for the blue spectra since the wavelength coverage is short and we are not interested in colour measurements .    finally , the galaxy spectra were binned along the spatial direction in order to assure a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n hereafter ) of @xmath22 @xmath5 , sufficient to our kinematic analysis . such a minimum s /",
    "n is reached only in the outermost radial bins , it increases at smaller radii reaching a maximum s / n@xmath23 @xmath5 in the radial bin corresponding to the galaxy centre .",
    "the spatial binning procedure was carefully carried out in order to assure the separation of the different structural components of ngc357 ( i.e. , the bulge , inner , and outer bar ) .",
    "as a first approach to disentangling the morphology of ngc357 , we perform an ellipse fitting over a nicmos2 f160w image taken from the hubble legacy archive ( prog .",
    "7330 , pi john mulchaey ) .",
    "for this purpose we use the iraf task ellipse , which follows the procedure outlined by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mor ] shows the resulting profiles of ellipticity , @xmath24 , position angle , pa , and the fourth cosine fourier coefficient , @xmath25 . the presence of the bars causes two sharp changes in the ellipticity and pa parameters : one peak at @xmath13 arcsec related to the inner bar , and a discontinuity at @xmath125 arcsec due to the outer bar .",
    "these two values are in agreement with the bar lengths estimated by .",
    "the @xmath25 profile also shows two peaks at the locations of the two bars .",
    "@xmath25 is a measurement of the deviation of the isophotes from pure ellipses , so positive values correspond to discy isophotes whereas negative values to boxy isophotes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two bars of ngc357 present discy isophotes .    we get a maximum isophotal ellipticity of @xmath260.15 and @xmath270.4 for the inner and outer bars , respectively , and a pa@xmath140@xmath7 for the inner bar , pa@xmath1120@xmath7 for the outer bar , and pa@xmath115@xmath7 for the disc .",
    "these measurements are also consistent with the estimates of and .",
    "two different techniques were used to derive the velocity and velocity dispersion profiles of ngc357 : a cross - correlation in the fourier domain and a full spectrum fitting in wavelength space . the cross - correlation procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is as follows : among the observed velocity standards , we select those that are spectroscopically most similar to the galaxy . after correcting them to rest frame , we combine the stellar spectra to create an artificial velocity standard star spectrum that will be used as a template for the cross - correlation .",
    "this standard spectrum is then broadened to several velocity dispersions and the results are correlated with the original star , obtaining for each case a cross - correlation peak with its full width half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "thus , we create a calibration table that provides the fwhm we expect if a spectrum with a given velocity dispersion is cross - correlated with our stellar template , so we can get the dispersion of the galaxy spectra by correlating them with the star .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity is a direct product of the correlation since the template is at rest .    for the full spectrum",
    "fitting we have made use of the penalized pixel fitting ( hereafter ppxf ) routine developed by @xcite .",
    "the spectral regions which are potentially affected by emission lines are previously masked on each galaxy absorption spectrum , which is then fitted with a linear combination of a well - selected subsample of the single stellar population models ( hereafter ssps ) of @xcite , previously convolved with a line - of - sight velocity distribution ( hereafter losvd ) .",
    "this losvd is parametrized by an expansion in gauss - hermite functions @xcite ; since the s / n requirements for this procedure get more demanding as the order of the desired losvd moments increases , we decided to focus only on the velocity and velocity dispersion to avoid the loss of spatial resolution caused by a wider radial binning .",
    "the two methods used for deriving the kinematics of ngc357 are completely independent and even work in different parameter spaces . in order to enhance the differences between both techniques ,",
    "we explore two different ways that offer complementary advantages : whereas the ssps help to alleviate the template mismatch problem , the artificial template was obtained by stellar spectra , which were observed and reduced exactly in the same way as the galaxy spectra , thus minimizing the possibility of introducing instrumental effects .",
    "the results obtained from both methods are fully consistent , with differences smaller than the corresponding error bars .",
    "these differences range from few kms@xmath5 in the central regions to a maximum of 10 kms@xmath5 in the farthest observed radii .",
    "figure [ fig : kin ] shows the final line - of - sight velocity ( after subtracting the systemic velocity ) and velocity dispersion profiles obtained with ppxf along the major axis of the inner bar , outer bar , and disc .      the presence of the inner bar is clearly unveiled by the shape of the rotation curve ( figure [ fig : kin ] , left panels ) , that follows the same characteristic _",
    "s- _ or _ double - hump _ profile previously observed for inner bars by",
    ". this profile is characterized by an inner steep slope so the rotation reaches a local maximum , it slightly drops to a local minimum and then it raises again slowly further out . since the two bars of ngc357 are almost perpendicular , with the inner one almost parallel to the major axis of the galaxy , we can conclude that the double - hump profile in figure [ fig : kin ] is completely due to the presence of the inner bar .",
    "this kind of rotation curve was theoretically derived by @xcite and @xcite by means of n - body simulations of single - barred galaxies ; in this last work , the authors show that the double - hump structure is more enhanced in galaxies with strong bars seen end - on , whereas the effect is weakened for larger viewing angles or weaker bars .",
    "although the double - hump rotation curve is clearly visible in the case of the inner bar of ngc357 , suggesting the bar is strong , the maximum isophotal ellipticity is only @xmath280.15 , which indicates that it is actually a very weak bar .",
    "indeed , the maximum ellipticity of the isophotes in a bar region correlates well with the bar strength @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile along the inner bar shows three local minima : a central drop corresponding to the so - called _ @xmath4-drop _ of , and two symmetric decreases exactly at the edges of the bar ( @xmath294 arcsec ) that can be identified as the _ @xmath4-hollows _",
    "@xcite , known to be signatures of an inner bar .",
    "these hollows have an amplitude of @xmath120 kms@xmath5 , consistent with the findings of @xcite , who found amplitudes ranging from 10 to 40 kms@xmath5",
    ". further discussion on these features and their different origins is found in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "as expected , the velocity dispersion decreases outwards .",
    "the outer bar of ngc357 ( figure [ fig : kin ] , middle panels ) is almost perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy , which we assume to be the kinematical line of nodes .",
    "this means that the line - of - sight velocity values along the outer bar are expected to be very low , as it is shown in figure [ fig : kin ] .",
    "however , a clear kinematical decoupled profile appears in the central region .",
    "this structure rotates faster than its surroundings and extends @xmath302 arcsec , which corresponds to the radial region of the @xmath4-drop observed in the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "a closer inspection to the inner bar velocity profile reveals the same decoupling , since two steep humps appear inside the double - hump profile , exactly at @xmath302 arcsec .",
    "unfortunately , the low s / n level of the spectra along the direction of the outer bar of ngc357 only allows us to analyse the kinematics in the inner @xmath3010 arcsec , so we can not explore the whole main bar to see if other signatures , as for example the @xmath4-hollows or the double - hump profile , are present .",
    "the kinematics along the major axis of the disc is shown in figure [ fig : kin ] ( right panels ) . in this case",
    ", we find as expected the maximum line - of - sight velocity values and the same central signatures found for the other directions : the decoupling in the velocity profile and the @xmath4-drop . in section [ sec : dis ] we discuss the possible structures that might be causing these signatures .",
    "the aim of this stellar population analysis is to recover the relative ages , metallicities , and formation timescales of the different structural components of ngc357 : bulge , inner bar , and outer bar .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of the data , although very high , still is not sufficient to analyse the disc , which requires spectra taken with 10 m - class telescopes . to perform this detail study , we have summed up the individual spectra , previously corrected for their kinematics ( velocity and velocity dispersion ) , to reach the desired s / n within each structural component . for this purpose ,",
    "we only add those spectra corresponding to the regions where a given component is clearly dominating the total luminosity : the inner @xmath291 arcsec for the bulge , from @xmath292 arcsec to @xmath294 arcsec for the inner bar , and from @xmath294 arcsec to @xmath3015 arcsec ( limited in this case by s / n requirements ) for the outer bar .",
    "since the spectra along the major axes of the two bars and the disc always cover the central region , we have two spectra for the bulge in the blue and red spectral range , respectively .",
    "however , the bars were observed only in the blue spectral range .",
    "again , we have chosen two methods to analyse the stellar populations : the line - strength indices and a full spectrum - fitting approach . unlike using the lick / ids system ,",
    "we have chosen to perform our line - strength analysis on the system imposed by the kinematics of the galaxy , as done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the second approach , we use the cross - correlation technique employed by @xcite and @xcite .    in both cases , comparisons with stellar population synthesis models",
    "are needed ; as for the kinematics , we have used the empirical models of @xcite , built from the miles stellar library @xcite .",
    "these models have a wide wavelength coverage ( from 3525 to 7500  ) and a resolution of 2.5(fwhm ) , constant over the whole spectral range .",
    "the ionized gas present in the galaxy leads to emission lines that contaminate the spectrum and fill in the absorption lines .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to correct for this emission to get the properties of the stellar populations from the spectra . indeed ,",
    "if a proper separation of both contributions ( the stellar absorptions and gaseous emissions ) is not performed before the analysis , the measured ages will be artificially older . in our particular case",
    ", we need to clean up the three balmer lines included in our spectral range ( h@xmath31 , h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 ) , and the fe5015 and mgb indices , which can be affected by the [ oiii]4959,5007 and [ nii]5198,5200 lines , respectively .",
    "the common procedure for this correction is to mask the spectral region possibly contaminated by emission lines and fit the obtained spectrum with a set of stellar population models . for this purpose",
    "we use the ulyss package , which minimizes the @xmath34 between the observed spectrum and a model spectrum consisting of a linear combination of non - linear parameters ( age and metallicity ) , corrected for the kinematics and multiplied by a polynomial to avoid flux calibration problems .",
    "we subtract the ulyss best fit spectrum to the original one in order to get the residuals plus the contribution of the emission lines .",
    "we then approximate each emission line with a gaussian , considering only those features with an amplitude larger than three times the standard deviation of the residuals .",
    "given the sensitivity of the emission correction , we double - check it by repeating it with the gandalf package @xcite .",
    "the advantage of gandalf is that it fits simultaneously the stellar and the gaseous contributions , by including emission lines as gaussians in the set of stellar population models used as templates .",
    "although gandalf is also based on @xmath34 minimization , it differs from ulyss in that it fits the stellar contribution with a linear combination of models , while ulyss interpolates the grid of templates to look for the most appropriate single stellar population model .",
    "there are many details to take care of when fitting the full spectrum , such as the initial guesses and the number and range of the masked regions .",
    "for example , in the case of the blue spectra of ngc357 , we are forced to mask the cn band as we find evidences of its @xmath0-enhancement ( not included in the scaled - solar models of * ? ? ?",
    "when the amount of emission derived from the two routines is in agreement , we subtract it from the observed spectra and use the results for the analysis of the stellar populations .",
    "figure [ fig : emission ] presents an example of the fitting performed with ulyss for the bulge red spectrum because it shows h@xmath31 and [ oiii]5007 , which are the most prominent emission lines we observed .",
    "a set of suitable absorption line - strength indices are measured over the emission - cleaned spectra of the bulge , inner bar , and outer bar , as well as over the @xcite models . in order to compare the results of the three components , the galaxy spectra and the ssps",
    "are first degraded to their maximum resolution , given by the higher value of the velocity dispersion profile ( @xmath35180 kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "all the measurements are performed in the same system , i.e. , the one defined by the kinematics of the galaxy in a consistent way .",
    "we plot the values obtained for an age indicator versus those of a metallicity indicator for the ssp models , in order to obtain model grids such as those shown in figures [ fig : spbb ] and [ fig : spall ] .",
    "these grids are not perfectly orthogonal due to the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "the mean luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities of each structural component of ngc357 can then be derived by simply overplotting the observed indices on these grids .",
    "in particular , we computed all the lick indices included in our spectral range , following the definitions given by @xcite . note",
    "that although the index definitions are similar , our model measurements are not in the lick / ids resolution and ids instrumental system , but at constant @xmath4 and flux - calibration response curve .",
    "since the red pseudo - continuum of the fe4383 index falls partially out of our blue spectral range , we have defined a new fe4383@xmath36 index ( named after _ short red _ , see appendix [ sec : apfe ] for details ) .",
    "table [ tab : fe ] presents the definitions of the new fe4383@xmath36 and the original lick / ids fe4383 index .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     \\(1 ) classical bulge + inner disc + inner bar + outer bar + disc ; + ( 2 ) pseudobulge + inner bar + outer bar + disc .",
    "+      the second possibility for the structure of ngc357 is that there is no inner disc .",
    "if this is the case , the central kinematical decoupling and the @xmath4-drop have to be caused by the bulge itself , which therefore shows disc - like properties that indicate it is a pseudobulge rather than a classical one .",
    "this hypothesis is strongly supported by the srsic index @xcite measured for the bulge of ngc357 by ; they performed a photometric decomposition of an _",
    "i_-band image and obtained _ _",
    "n__=1.40@xmath290.08 , which is compatible with a pseudobulge .",
    "indeed , @xcite study a sample of 77 galaxies and find that @xmath190% of pseudobulges have _",
    "_ n__@xmath372 , whereas classical bulges have _ _ n__@xmath382 .    within this new context ,",
    "the @xmath4-drop is not actually a drop with respect to the higher velocity dispersion of the bulge , but the maximum velocity dispersion of the pseudobulge itself .",
    "of course , the pseudobulge presents a not so high velocity dispersion , since it is rotationally supported , and therefore it can be colder than the inner bar . in this case , the two peaks of the velocity dispersion values at either sides of the centre have to be understood as signatures of the relatively hotter inner bar where this component dominates the total luminosity .",
    "the @xmath4-hollows appear where the bar ends and the light of the pseudobulge is the main contribution to the total flux .",
    "the surrounding structure , i.e. , the outer bar , is also hotter than the outer parts of the pseudobulge and for that reason the velocity dispersion values increase again beyond the @xmath4-hollows .",
    "the characteristic velocity dispersions for each structure is indicated in table [ tab : sigmas ] .",
    "this scenario is completely different from that of the galaxies shown in @xcite .",
    "however , the main conclusion on the origin of the @xmath4-hollows remains as it is attributed to the contrast of velocity dispersions between components .",
    "this hypothesis also explains the results from the analysis of the morphology of ngc357 : the ellipticity profile acquires approximately the same value at either sides of the peak due to the inner bar , suggesting that the centre and the surrounding regions are dominated by the same structure .",
    "concerning the dynamical support of the bulge , we estimate @xmath390.23 and @xmath400.1 in the bulge region ; therefore , the bulge is consistent with an oblate spheroid flattened by rotation .",
    "nevertheless , the interpretration of the @xmath41 relation has to be done carefully , since a complex kinematical structure of the galaxy might conduct to misleading results , as it is shown in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the stellar populations of ngc357 is focused on three single regions : bulge , inner bar and outer bar .",
    "the striking result obtained in this work is that the bulge and inner bar show very similar stellar population properties , indicating that they were formed in the same process or , at least , from the same source of stars .",
    "moreover , the outer bar is also nearly coeval to the inner structures , although it presents a lower metallicity and a larger @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "this result points towards a faster assembly of the outer bar with respect to the bulge and inner bar .",
    "finally , we compare the bulge and outer bar of ngc357 with other bulges and main bars of single- and double - barred galaxies with similar central @xmath4 values , finding no significant differences among them .",
    "the results obtained here for ngc357 indicate that theories claiming that inner bars play a major role in the secular evolution might not be suitable for this galaxy .",
    "if inner bars were key to transport gas to the central regions and trigger star formation there , a gradient in age and metallicity from outer to inner structures would be expected , presenting a younger population in the galaxy centre .",
    "although our galaxy has gas content and probably some star formation is taking place in it , the stellar population analysis indicates that this is not the main mechanism driving the evolution of ngc357 .",
    "therefore , these results lead to the question on how ngc357 formed .",
    "numerical simulations have predicted different scenarios for the formation of nested bars systems , most of them requiring the presence of a dissipative component that is dynamically disturbed and generates the secondary bar . within this scenario ,",
    "the inner bar should be younger than the outer bar .",
    "however , the two bars of ngc357 have similar population properties , so they were formed at the same time or , most likely , the existing stars from the outer bar or the disc redistributed and shaped the inner structures . therefore , only those numerical works that do not need gas to generate the double - barred objects seem to be compatible with the observational evidences shown here for ngc357 .",
    "this is the case of the n - body simulations by @xcite , who use a disc and a rapidly rotating bulge ( like a pseudobulge ) to create a double - barred system . in these simulations ,",
    "the inner bar appears first , but this is probably a consequence of the initial presence of the pseudobulge : in the real universe , the outer bar most likely is formed first , so the pseudobulge would be generated from the gas flow along it .",
    "this scenario reinforces the hypothesis of the pseudobulge for the case of ngc357 , since the bulge rotation is an essential condition for generating the two bars within the @xcite gas - free framework .",
    "there is one possibility to reconcile the classical secular approach with the observational results for ngc357 , and this is to assume a very fast formation of the central components : immediately after the outer bar was created , the gas flowed along it , triggered a quick star formation and formed the inner bar and the bulge . within this scenario",
    ", the final ages of the three components would be very similar",
    ". the outer bar would be slightly older , but this is consistent with our results taking into account the error bars .",
    "in this scenario a positive metallicity gradient for the gas along the outer bar is required .",
    "although this fact might be somewhat striking , from a stellar ( not gaseous ) point of view there is evidence for such gradients .",
    "indeed , study a sample of 20 barred galaxies and find that some of them tend to become more metal - rich at the ends of the main bars .",
    "moreover , those objects have older mean ages and higher central velocity dispersions than the rest of the sample , which is in agreement with the properties found for ngc357 .",
    "unfortunately , the s / n ratio of our data is not enough to measure gradients along the main bar to check this possibility .",
    "we have performed for the first time a detailed analysis of the morphological , kinematical , and stellar population properties of a prototype double - barred early - type disc galaxy .",
    "we put special emphasis on the inner bar in order to constrain its role in the evolution of this galaxy . the observational strategy consisted in taking very deep long - slit spectra along the directions of the inner and outer bars and the major axis of the disc .",
    "the presence of the two bars is clearly revealed by the ellipticity and pa profiles , which show the usual sharp changes due to this kind of structure .",
    "moreover , the kinematical analysis also presents clear signatures due to the inner bar : the double - hump profile in the velocity and the @xmath4-hollows in the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "these hollows are due to the contrast between the velocity dispersion values of the inner bar and the central structure , that might be a classical bulge with a velocity dispersion higher than the inner bar , or a pseudobulge with a lower velocity dispersion than the bar .",
    "the relative contribution of the inner bar to the total flux also influences the size and depth of the @xmath4-hollows .",
    "it remains unclear if the @xmath4-hollows or other related features may appear for the case of the outer bar .",
    "unfortunately , the s / n of the main bar spectrum is not sufficient to explore the kinematics at its ends .",
    "the analysis of the kinematics of ngc357 also reveals a kinematically - decoupled structure rotating faster than its surroundings at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this signature matches in size with a central @xmath4-drop .",
    "ngc357 is the first observed galaxy in which a @xmath4-drop and the @xmath4-hollows coexist .",
    "this fact illustrates the differences between both signatures : whereas the former are just due to the presence of the inner bar , the latter is caused by an inner , colder structure .",
    "due to the different nature of both signatures , we want to stress that a double - barred galaxy might present a @xmath4-drop , the @xmath4-hollows , or both , as in this case .",
    "the structural composition of ngc357 has to account for all the observational evidences found in the analysis of the photometry and kinematics .",
    "the presence of the disc and the two bars is clear , but the central region turns out to be more difficult to disentangle .",
    "in fact , two possible scenarios are compatible with the results obtained in this work .",
    "the first possibility is that ngc357 hosts a classical , hot bulge together with an inner disc , which would be responsible of the decoupling in the velocity profile and the @xmath4-drop .",
    "the second scenario is that the bulge of ngc357 is , in fact , a cold pseudobulge , which is directly related to the kinematical central signatures .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the bulge and inner bar show similar stellar population properties ( age , metallicity and @xmath0-enhancement ) , whereas the outer bar has no significant difference in age but it is less metal - rich and more @xmath0-enhanced , indicating that it was assembled in shorter timescales than the inner structures .",
    "this result seems to discard for this galaxy the traditional secular evolution scenario , in which the star formation triggered by the gas flown along the outer structures is causing the formation of the central parts .",
    "therefore , ngc357 has been shaped by the redistribution of the existing stars , maybe in a _",
    "secular _ way in which stars from the disc form the inner components , or maybe in an initial _",
    "disc + pseudobulge _ framework so the inner bar is lately formed from the pseudobulge stars .",
    "this last scenario is backed by the numerical work of @xcite , who create double - barred systems from a pure stellar disc and pseudobulge . in this scenario , the fast rotation of",
    "the pseudobulge is the key element to generate bars without the gas contribution .",
    "an analysis such as the one presented in this work for a larger sample of double - barred galaxies is required to derive general and robust conclusions on the formation of these complex objects .",
    "fortunately , the striking results obtained for ngc357 are motivating and shed light on the importance of carefully studying double - barred galaxies , from the outer disc to the very central regions .",
