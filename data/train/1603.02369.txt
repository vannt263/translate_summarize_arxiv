    "graphene  @xcite has been one of the most actively studied research subjects in current condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "although its unique electronic property is characterized already in a single - particle level , namely , with the linear electronic energy dispersion , i.e. , the dirac cone dispersion , at the fermi energy ( @xmath1 )  @xcite , many - body effects on graphene have also attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "for example , tremendous efforts have been devoted on investigating whether a spin liquid state can exist in the half - filled hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite , one of the simplest models for graphene , and the nature of metal - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "the research has been also extended to graphene derived systems , e.g. , a series of hydrogenated graphene  @xcite . a first - principles calculation based on density functional theory ( dft )",
    "has predicted that the single - side hydrogenated graphene , called graphone , becomes a ferromagnetic ( fm ) semiconductor with a small indirect gap  @xcite .",
    "other dft based study has suggested that the single - side hydrogenated and fluorinated graphenes are both candidates for quantum spin liquid  @xcite .",
    "possible increase of the spin - orbit coupling due to the @xmath2 lattice distortion has been also discussed  @xcite .",
    "many - body effects on the hydrogenated graphene , however , have not been explored so far . on the one hand ,",
    "the isolated graphene , described by , e.g. , the single - band hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite , remains semi - metallic even when a moderate amount of electron interactions are introduced before the antiferromagnetic instability sets in  @xcite , and thus the correlation effect in semi - metallic phase is merely renormalization  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron correlation in the hydrogen atoms should be treated in a many - body way , as suggested in the heitler - london description for the chemical bonding of a hydrogen molecule  @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that many - body effects on hydrogen atoms in metal can induce a kondo - like effect and make a drastic correction in the single - particle excitation spectrum as compared with that obtained by dft calculations  @xcite .    here",
    ", we employ the variational cluster approximation ( vca )  @xcite and the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt )  @xcite to investigate many - body effects on graphone by considering a half - depleted periodic anderson model on the honeycomb lattice at half filling .",
    "we find that the ground state of this model is fm semi - metallic .",
    "the fm state is attributed to the instability of a flat band located at @xmath1 in the noninteracting limit and smoothly connected to the lieb - mattis type ferromagnetism .",
    "the liner spin wave analysis of an effective spin model for the periodic anderson model in the strong coupling limit finds that the spin wave excitations in the fm state exhibits the linear dispersion in momentum at zero temperature , while the spin wave dispersion becomes quadratic at finite temperatures , implying that the fm state is fragile against thermal fluctuations and can be stable only at zero temperature .",
    "our vca calculations indeed find that the finite temperature phase diagram is dominated by a paramagnetic ( pm ) state .",
    "most significantly , we find that massless dirac quasiparticles emerge at @xmath1 upon introducing the electron correlation in the pm phase .",
    "the dirac fermi velocity of the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles is found to be highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight at the fermi energy and increase monotonically with the electron correlation .",
    "we show that the emergence of the massless dirac quasiparticles is well captured by the simple hubbard - i approximation and can be understood as the result of the spectral weight redistribution involving a large energy scale of the electron correlation . by considering an effective hamiltonian for the quasiparticles",
    ", we discuss the chiral symmetry of the single - particle excitations in the pm phase within the hubbard - i approximation and argue that the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles are protected by the electron correlation .",
    "the massless dirac quasiparticles found here in the pm phase are therefore in sharp contrast to massless dirac dispersions generated by band engineering with breaking a crystalline symmetry , and represent the first example of the emergence of massless dirac quasiparticles induced by dynamical electron correlations .",

    "this is the first example of the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles due to dynamical electron correlations without breaking any spatial symmetry .",
    "third , let us briefly discuss the experimental implications of our results .",
    "we have studied the half - depleted periodic anderson model on the honeycomb lattice at half filling , which can be considered as the simplest model for the single - side hydrogenated graphene .",
    "recently , ray _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a ferromagnetism in a partially hydrogenated graphene on the graphite substrate .",
    "their observation of the ferromagnetism is consistent with our ground state calculations .",
    "although lieb s theorem can not directly applied to the periodic anderson model studied here , we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : pd ] and appendix  [ appsec : ed ] that the fm ground state found in our calculations is smoothly connected to the lieb - mattis type ferromagnetism .",
    "therefore , we attribute the ferromagnetism observed experimentally to the lieb - mattis type ferromagnetism .",
    "another possible experiment which is relevant to our calculations is a graphene sheet on transition metal substrates .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments for graphene deposited on ni(111 ) and co(0001 ) surfaces . in these systems ,",
    "the sublattice symmetry of graphene is apparently broken .",
    "this is because the carbon atoms on @xmath9 sublattice of the graphene sheet locate on top of the transition metal atoms of the substrate , whereas the carbon atoms on @xmath8 sublattice are placed on top of the interstitial sites of the transition metal atoms .",
    "therefore , the carbon @xmath321 orbitals on @xmath9 sublattice hybridize strongly with the transition metal @xmath322 orbitals , but the hybridization between the carbon atoms on @xmath8 sublattice and the transition metal atoms is rather weak . in spite of the broken sublattice symmetry , they have observed in their arpes experiments the linearly dispersing single - particle excitations with the dirac point about 2.8 ev below the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of the dirac point from the fermi energy might be understood simply as a consequence of the electron transfer from the substrate .",
    "since the most simplest model for these systems is the half - depleted periodic anderson model studied here , their observation can be understood as the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles induced by the electron correlation of transition metals .",
    "however , more detailed study is highly desired for quantitative comparison .",
    "using the vca and the cpt , we have studied the finite temperature phase diagram of the half - depleted periodic anderson model at half - filling for a model of graphone , i.e. , the single - side hydrogenated graphene .",
    "we have found that the ground state is fm as long as the electron correlation @xmath0 on the hydrogen impurity sites is finite .",
    "although the single - particle excitations with the same spin are gapped , the quasiparticle dispersions with the opposite spins touch at @xmath36 and @xmath37 points . therefore , this fm state is semi - metallic .",
    "we have discussed the relevance of lieb s theorem to the periodic anderson model , and shown , with the help of numerically exactly diagonalizing small clusters , that the fm ground state found here is smoothly connected to the lieb - mattis type ferromagnetism .",
    "we have also shown in the strong coupling limit that the fm state displays the linear spin wave dispersion at zero temperature , rather than the quadratic spin wave dispersion often observed in the fm state .",
    "this is simply because of the peculiar dirac like electron energy dispersion of the conduction band .",
    "however , we have found that the spin wave dispersion becomes quadratic at finite temperatures , thus implying that the fm state is stable only at zero temperature , consistent with mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "indeed , we have found using the vca that the fm state is fragile against thermal fluctuations , and the finite temperature phase diagram is dominated by the pm phase .",
    "more surprisingly , our cpt calculations have revealed that the massless dirac quasiparticles emerge at @xmath36 and @xmath37 points with the dirac points exactly at the fermi energy , once the electron correlation @xmath0 is introduced in the pm state .",
    "this should be contrasted with the quadratic quasiparticle dispersions in the fm phase .",
    "we have shown that the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles in the pm phase can be reproduced in the hubbard - i approximation . moreover",
    ", we have found that the formation of the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles is accompanied with the spectral weight redistribution of the single - particle excitations , involving a large energy scale of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we have found in both cpt and hubbard - i approximation that the single - particle spectral weight @xmath124 for @xmath9 orbital at the dirac point is proportional to the square of the dirac fermi velocity @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath323 , where @xmath113 is zero when @xmath93 and monotonically increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this universal relation expresses that the involvement of @xmath9 orbital in the low - energy excitations is essential for the formation of the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles . constructing the effective quasiparticle hamiltonian ,",
    "we have argued that the dirac cones with the point contacts at @xmath36 and @xmath37 points are protected by the electron correlation @xmath0 .",
    "our finding therefore represents the first example of the emergence of massless dirac quasiparticles induced by the electron correlation without breaking any spatial symmetry .",

    "<S> using the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) and the cluster perturbation theory , we study the finite temperature phase diagram of a half - depleted periodic anderson model on the honeycomb lattice at half filling for a model of graphone , i.e. , single - side hydrogenated graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of this model is found to be ferromagnetic ( fm ) semi - metal . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this fm state is attributed to the instability of a flat band located at the fermi energy in the noninteracting limit and is smoothly connected to the lieb - mattis type ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the spin wave dispersion in the fm state is linear in momentum at zero temperature but becomes quadratic at finite temperatures , implying that the fm state is fragile against thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our vca calculations find that the paramagnetic ( pm ) state dominates the finite temperature phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> more surprisingly , we find that massless dirac quasiparticles with the linear energy dispersion emerge at the fermi energy upon introducing the electron correlation @xmath0 at the impurity sites in the pm phase . the dirac fermi velocity is found to be highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight of the emergent massless dirac quasiparticles at the fermi energy and monotonically increases with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these unexpected massless dirac quasiparticles are also examined with the hubbard - i approximation and the origin is discussed in terms of the spectral weight redistribution involving a large energy scale of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> considering an effective quasiparticle hamiltonian which reproduces the single - particle excitations obtained by the hubbard - i approximation , we argue that the massless dirac quasiparticles are protected by the electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> our finding is therefore the first example of the emergence of massless dirac quasiparticles due to dynamical electron correlations without breaking any spatial symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental implications of our results for graphone as well as a graphene sheet on transition metal substrates are also briefly discussed . </S>"
