    "<S> it is shown that at hera energies @xmath0 production via the subprocess @xmath1 dominates over the resolved photon contribution via the photon - gluon fusion at @xmath2 gev / c and over the leading order direct photon - gluon fusion contribution at @xmath3 gev / c .    -2.0 </S>",

    "<S> previous calculations of @xmath0 photoproduction at large @xmath4 have included direct charmonium production via photon - gluon fusion using the colour singlet model in lo @xcite and nlo approximation @xcite , diffractive inelastic @xmath0 production @xcite , resolved photon contributions via subprocesses @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath0 production from @xmath7 quark decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine the diffractive - like contribution of the charm quark excitation in a photon to the @xmath0 photoproduction at large @xmath4 via partonic subprocess @xmath1 , where charm quarks in the initial state are generated by qcd evolution of the photon structure functions ( psf ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that at low @xmath8 the charm content of the photon is virtually nil , but at @xmath8 of order @xmath9 one has sufficient resolution to find charm quarks in photon . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in the processes of the @xmath0 photoproduction at large @xmath4 the relevant qcd scale @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation is partly the same as the approach used in ref.@xcite for description of the charm quark hadroproduction and based on the fact that both the central and diffractive components of charm production can be understood in the intrinsic charm structure function approach . </S>",
    "<S> recently we have presented the results of the calculations for contributions of the intrinsic charm in the proton to the @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of a photon structure function @xcite in the resolved - photon interaction at hera energy and beyond is also very interested @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually it is supposed that at high energy in the resolved - photon interaction the gluon content of a photon is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> howere , the heavy quark content of the photon is also an increasingly important subject of study @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we would like to show that in the @xmath0 photoproduction at lager @xmath4 via resolved - photon interaction the charm content of a photon is more important and it is may be studied experimentally using @xmath0 plus open charm associated photoproduction .    </S>",

    "<S> the measurable cross - section is obtained by folding the hard parton level cross - section with the respective parton densities : @xmath16 here : @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath0 rapidity , @xmath4 is the @xmath0 transverse momentum , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the gluon distribution function in a proton , at the scale @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the charm quark distribution function in a photon , @xmath26 is the square of a total energy of colliding particles in the @xmath27 center of mass reference frame . </S>",

    "<S> the charm content of a photon can be presented as the composition of a hadron  like psf and a point  like ( quark - gluon ) psf @xcite : @xmath28 in accordance with the vector - meson - dominance ( vmd ) model @xcite , the hadron  like @xmath13-quark psf is presented via the charm quark distribution function of @xmath29 meson : @xmath30 with @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the precise value of @xmath32 clearly has to be extracted from experiment . </S>",
    "<S> similar to ref.@xcite , where the photoproduction of charm hadrons in vmd model have been discussed , we used for @xmath33 the simple scaling parametrization , which takes into account c - quark mass effects : @xmath34    the @xmath13-quark point - like part of the psf can be calculated using perturbative approach . </S>",
    "<S> as it was shown in ref.@xcite , the distribution of a heavy quark with mass @xmath35 in the photon near the threshold ( @xmath36 ) should be calculated from the complete massive lowest order ( bethe - heitler ) cross section for @xmath37 process :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 + [ x^2+(1-x)^2 + 4rx(1 - 3x)-8r^2x^2]\\ln\\biggl(\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\biggr),\\ ] ] @xmath40    let us next consider the dynamical cutoff for the charm excitation processes . </S>",
    "<S> for the typical charm excitation diagram , the charm quark must receive sufficient transfer momentum , which is necessary to excite @xmath41 pair . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a minimum dynamical resolution @xmath42 for the momentum transfer @xmath43 of the @xmath1 subprocesses . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath44 , although the specification of the scale is uncertain by factors @xcite . the dependence of the our results from the choice of @xmath42 will be discussed later .    because of the relevant qcd scale @xmath8 is order of @xmath45 , we consider at first @xmath4 distribution of the @xmath0-mesons which are generated in @xmath27 collisions via charm excitation in the photon . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows our predictions for @xmath46s @xmath4-spectra at the energy @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 . as the same ref.@xcite we used in the calculation the next value of the dynamical cutoff @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that @xmath49quark psf contribution ( curves 2 and 3 in figs . 2 - 4 ) depends on @xmath50 only at low @xmath51 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> so the charm excitation mechanism ( point - like psf contribution ) dominates over the lo direct photon - gluon fusion at large transverse momentum @xmath3 gev / c and more bigger the contribution of the gluon psf at @xmath52 gev / c .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of the scaling variable @xmath53 as well as transverse momentum can be used for separation of the elastic ( @xmath54 gev / c ) and inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction events . in the fig .  3 the @xmath53-distributions for the @xmath0 photoproduction at @xmath47 gev and @xmath55 gev / c are shown . in this region of @xmath4 our calculation are independent on the value of @xmath42 . we see that at small @xmath56 the contribution of the @xmath49quark psf is equal to the direct photon - gluon fusion contribution . the contribution of the hadron - like part of the @xmath49quark psf , connected with the nonperturbative fluctuations @xmath57,dominates over the point - like @xmath49quark psf contribution at @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the gluon psf is very small at all @xmath59 .    in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 the results of calculation for the total cross section of the @xmath0 photoproduction at @xmath48 and @xmath55 gev / c versus @xmath60 are presented . the contribution of the subprocess @xmath1 , which is independent of the dynamical cutoff at large @xmath4 , rapidly grows beginning with @xmath61 gev and at @xmath47 gev one has @xmath62 for contribution of the point - like component and @xmath63 for contribution of the hadron - like component . at the energies @xmath64 gev the behaviour of the total cross sections both for the photon - gluon fusion as for the charm excitation diagrams </S>",
    "<S> are the same and to be conditioned by the gluon distribution function in the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the resolved photon interaction via subprocess @xmath65 in the total cross section at large @xmath4 is two order of magnitude smaller the contributions of the discussed above mechanisms .    </S>",
    "<S> note , that we do nt take into consideration so - called @xmath66-factor which is needed as usual for correct normalization of the leading order qcd predictions and experimental data . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we accurately predict only the relative contributions of the different @xmath0 production mechanism at large @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained that at high energies the total ( perturbative and nonperturbative ) contribution of the @xmath49quark psf in the @xmath29 photoproduction at @xmath67 gev / c may be 50 - 60% of the lo direct photon - gluon fusion contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated here only direct @xmath0 photoproduction cross section via different mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that in the resolved photon @xmath0 photoproduction at large @xmath4 via gluon - gluon fusion @xcite the two - step mechanism dominates : @xmath68 with decay @xmath69 where @xmath70 are p - wave charmonium states . </S>",
    "<S> that is why the calculation of the @xmath0 photoproduction via subproceses @xmath71 with @xmath69 is also very interesting . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to present the corresponding calculations in the forthcoming papers . </S>",
    "<S> the another important source of the @xmath0 with large @xmath4 in @xmath27 interactions may be so - called c - quark fragmentation into @xmath0 or @xmath70 which was discussed recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fragmentational contribution connected with the c - quark , which was born in a hard partonic interaction , may be separate experimentally from the contribution of the resolved photon interactions @xcite via subprocesses @xmath72 or @xmath73 which include as the fragmentational type @xmath0 production as the recombinational one . because of the fact that in the resolved photon interactions it has characteristic hadron jet in the direction of the initial photon beam .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussed here @xmath0 photoproduction mechanism via the charm quark excitation can be used also for prediction of the open charm production rates at high @xmath4 in @xmath27 collisions at hera energy and beyond @xcite .    </S>",
