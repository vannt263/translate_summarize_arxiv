    "cosmic string is one of the relic structures that are predicted to be produced in the course of symmetry breaking in the hot , early universe , whose discovery will probably be an important landmark for the high energy physics .",
    "the quest for cosmic strings has been conducted in two ways : statistical method and direct search for individual cosmic string . on the statistical side",
    ", many studies agreed that the contribution from cosmic strings to statistical observables such as the power spectrum is at most @xmath2 @xcite , reconfirming that cosmic strings played a minor role , if any , in making the universe .",
    "other workers have set upper limits on the cosmic string parameter @xmath3 @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we introduce a technique for estimating how strong a signal from cosmic strings has to be in order to be identified unequivocally .",
    "the detecting power of this technique is calibrated by applying it to simulated anisotropy maps based on reasonable modeling . in the last part of this letter",
    ", we apply this technique to the _ wmap _ 3 year w - band data set and analyze the implication of the results .",
    "a cosmic string can leave discrete temperature steps in a cmb anisotropy map due to the kaiser - stebbins effect @xcite , with the height of a step @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the universal background temperature of cmb .",
    "however , those step patterns are probably obscured by instrumental noises and other physical structures of anisotropies .",
    "decomposition of a cmb anisotropy sky map patch .",
    "a square patch is decomposed into the uniform background temperature ( @xmath7 ) + gaussian fluctuation ( @xmath8)+ discrete temperature step ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the number of pixels in a patch is @xmath10.,width=491 ]    we consider a square patch of the cmb anisotropy sky map that extends to a size of the horizon at the time of recombination so that the conic spacetime formed by a cosmic string can be in effect within the region .",
    "then another square patch of the cmb anisotropy sky map that contains a segment of moving cosmic string can be decomposed into three parts , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] : ( 1 ) the uniform background temperature ( @xmath7 ) , ( 2 ) the gaussian fluctuation ( variance @xmath11 ) , and ( 3 ) the discrete temperature step ( @xmath9 ) from a moving cosmic string .",
    "the uniform background temperature @xmath7 comes from superhorizon - scale primordial fluctuations .",
    "since we pick a horizon - sized region , the super - horizon fluctuations will appear to be a constant temperature shift for the whole patch .",
    "smaller scale ( sub - horizon ) fluctuations and instrumental noise add up incoherently to form a gaussian fluctuation with the variance @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are variances for fluctuations of primordial origin and instrumental noise , respectively . we introduce five parameters that characterize a square patch of a string - embedded sky map , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( blueshifted pixels / total pixels ) , and @xmath17 ( orientation of step ) .",
    "we concoct a simulated patch of the cmb anisotropy map by assigning arbitrary legitimate values to the parameters and adding the three components illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "to recover these parameters from the cmb anisotropy map where the step pattern is intermixed , we employ five observables @xmath18 that can be expressed in terms of @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the signal at the @xmath21th pixel and @xmath22 is the two - dimensional gridded position vector for the @xmath21th pixel defined in a square patch .",
    "evolution of errors of characteristic parameters as functions of @xmath15 with input values of parameters @xmath23 .",
    "_ left panels _ : @xmath24 pixels in a square . _",
    "middle panels _ : @xmath25 pixels .",
    "_ right panels _ : @xmath26 pixels . for each size of patch ,",
    "the number of simulations performed is 10,000 .",
    "the shaded regions indicate the ranges of @xmath15 for which the step feature in a patch is not obvious compared to its background fluctuation ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the result on @xmath28 is biased upward because the simulations with erroneous values of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) were not included in the statistics.,width=491 ]    in the absence of the background fluctuation ( @xmath30 ) , the following analytic expressions for the characteristic parameters return the exact input values : @xmath31 with the background fluctuation turned on , an observed characteristic parameter @xmath32 is expressed as an unbiased estimate @xmath33 plus a gaussian error @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 the errors ( @xmath37 ) present in the equations ( [ 11 ] ) are measures of how precisely the information on a temperature step screened by background fluctuation is recovered .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the behaviors of errors as functions of @xmath15 for three different pixel numbers for a patch .",
    "the standard deviation of the background fluctuation chosen here is the mean standard deviation of patches with angular radius @xmath38 ( the angular size of the horizon at the recombination for the @xmath39cdm model ) for the wmap 3 year w - band data set with the kp2 mask applied .",
    "the most pronounced feature of the graphs is that the error bars are wildly undulating for small @xmath15 compared to @xmath8 , with attenuating envelopes as @xmath15 increases .",
    "the algorithm works poorly for low @xmath15 compared to @xmath8 , such as the @xmath40 error on the orientation estimate .",
    ".[table1]simulation results at the critical values of @xmath15 above which @xmath41s are small enough and do not decrease any more . [ cols=\"^,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     even the breakdowns of the algorithm do happen in the shaded region , resulting in erroneous parameter values such as negative @xmath15 or @xmath16 not in the range between 0 and 1 .",
    "simulations with collapsed results are not included in the statistics shown in figure [ fig2 ] since those cases are evidently the ones with insufficiently strong signals against background fluctuation .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , we begin obtaining the computed parameters that are very close to the true values with acceptable errors ( dubbed the `` good '' results ) , and it allows us to recover the temperature step parameters faithfully .",
    "we also find from figure [ fig2 ] that a patch with more pixels works better with a faster attenuation of uncertainties .",
    "table [ table1 ] displays the performances of the algorithm for the values of @xmath15 at the borders , above which errors for the temperature step ( @xmath41 ) do not get any better .",
    "we use circular patches for _ wmap _ data analysis rather than square patches because of the computational advantage .",
    "algebraic expressions for the observables given in equations ( [ 6])-([10 ] ) work very well for circular patches with negligible numerical differences for the case of square patches . a square patch with @xmath26 pixels at the normal resolution of _ wmap _ w - band data",
    "covers nearly the same area as the circular region with angular radius @xmath38 .",
    "we performed a further detecting power test with @xmath26 pixels patches and found empirically that the relation between the critical value of @xmath15 , @xmath42 , above which `` good '' results start to come out , and @xmath8 is @xmath43 the different choices of input values for the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath7 showed no noticeable difference in the evolutions of errors .",
    "an observed cmb anisotropy map is an aggregate of various independent modes of perturbation ranging from tiny sub - horizon scales to super - horizon scales well beyond the correlation length .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , fluctuations with larger or smaller scales compared to the size of a test patch are neatly prescribed , but the intermediate scales whose wavelengths are comparable to the size of a test patch will appear to be continuous temperature tilts that also give plausible values of the step parameters .",
    "one drawback of this algorithm is that it does not distinguish between a discrete temperature step and a smooth temperature slope .",
    "however , this shortcoming can be easily fixed : if an apparent temperature step is detected at a spot on the map , we repeat the analysis with a half - sized patch at the same spot . if the structure is a continuous slope , then it would return half the value of @xmath28 than the previous result , while for the signal from a discrete step , the returned @xmath28 should stay the same within the error .",
    "we conducted the step signal search through the _ wmap _ 3 year w - band data set and found 193,160 unqualified signals against background fluctuation ( the constraint in eq .",
    "[ [ 12 ] ] is not applied ) , 129,049 qualified steps+tilts ( signals that meet the constraint eq . [",
    "[ 12 ] ] ; i.e. , @xmath44 ) , and 12,330 qualified discriminated steps .",
    "distributions of @xmath28 detected in _ wmap _ 3 year w - band data set .",
    "the number of step signals found are 193,160 unqualified signals ( _ dotted curve _ ) , 129,049 qualified steps+tilts ( _ dashed curve _ ) , and 12,330 qualified steps ( _ solid curve_).,width=264 ]    the @xmath28 value of qualified steps is in the range @xmath45 as the curves show in figure [ fig3 ] . patches with radius @xmath38 in the _ wmap _ 3 year w - band have a background fluctuation @xmath8 less than 176 @xmath46 in the kp2-mask - cleared region .",
    "this means , at the worst case , we can identify a step signal as low as @xmath47 with moderate errors .",
    "therefore , if there are cosmic string signals with @xmath48 and if they are located in the available region ( out of the galactic plane or the kp2 masked region ) , they would not be missed .",
    "thus , we can set an upper limit on the cosmic string signal @xmath49 where @xmath50 is arbitrary .",
    "thus , with @xmath51 @xcite , the upper limit of the cosmic string parameter @xmath3 can be estimated as @xmath52",
    "we have presented and tested a new technique to directly discover cosmic strings via the patterns they would produce in a cmb anisotropy map .",
    "we found that the minimum magnitude of the step signal that is required to be unequivocally identified is @xmath53 for the _ wmap _ 3 year w - band data set .",
    "this algorithm can be used to crop the reliable step signals from the cmb anisotropy data , and it will serve as the valuable ground work for future pattern searches with more refined data , such as further _",
