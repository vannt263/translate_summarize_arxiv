    "( @xmath5 m ) imaging data of the galactic centre were obtained .",
    "the wollaston prism mode of naco made it possible to simultaneously observe two orthogonal polarisation angles ( corresponding to the ordinary and the extraordinary beam of the prism respectively ) per image . in order to cover a sufficient number of polarimetric channels ,",
    "the observed angles were switched using a half - wave retarder plate .",
    "the images were obtained alternately covering the polarisation angles 0@xmath6 / 90@xmath6 and 45@xmath6 / 135@xmath6 respectively .",

    "8 bright and isolated stars in the field of view served as calibrator sources . as sgra * was confused with a weak star , s17 , at the observation epoch , this star s flux contribution of 2.5 mjy was subtracted from the flare data .",
    "as always two pairs of polarisation channels were observed alternately , for each source sets of four flux values ( for the four angles ) per time bin were obtained . in order to extract the polarimetric parameters  degree of polarisation @xmath7 , angle of polarisation @xmath8  from a given data set , this data set was first normalised by dividing all four values by their average . due to this , the average of the data set is set to 1 .",
    "the amplitude of variations _ around the average level _ due to polarised flux is limited to the range from 0 to 1 .",
    "as we use the convention that the degree of polarisation is the ratio of polarised flux vs. total flux , this amplitude corresponds to the degree of polarisation .",
    "we compute the polarised flux as the product of the degree of polarisation and the total source flux .",
    "one should note that throughout this article `` polarisation '' and `` polarimetry '' refer to _ linear _ polarisation .",
    "as described above , in each image source fluxes are calibrated by dividing the target source count rates by the count rates of calibration stars taken from the same image ( photometric calibration ) .",
    "this means that a possible average polarisation of the calibrator stars is erased . as indeed the stars of the observed galactic centre region show an average polarisation of 4% at an angle of 25@xmath6 due to foreground extinction by dust ( eckart et al .",
    "@xcite , ott et al .",
    "@xcite ) , this has to be corrected .",
    "this correction was done by multiplying the four flux values of a data set with the function    @xmath9    ( polarimetric calibration ) .",
    "the factor 2 in the argument of the sine is due to the convention that polarisation angles are limited to the range [ 0@xmath6 , 180@xmath6 ] .",
    "after this , each normalised data set was fit with a sine curve with a period of 180@xmath6 .",
    "this delivers the degree of polarisation ( the sine curve s amplitude ) and the angle of polarisation ( the sine curve s phase ) .    in our definition ,",
    "a polarisation angle of 0@xmath6 corresponds to a pointing to the north and the angle is counted east of north . in both the polarimetric calibration and the fitting , a global rotation of the polarisation vector with respect to the sky of @xmath11 was taken into account .",
    "this rotation was found using polarimetric naco wollaston data of the calibrator star irs21 obtained in july 2005 . comparing the parameters extracted from this data set with results found with different instruments and reported earlier ( 14% and 14@xmath6 ; eckart et al .",
    "@xcite , ott et al .",
    "@xcite ) leads to a rotation of @xmath12 .",
    "this rotation might be caused by a known shift ( the abovementioned @xmath11 ) in the zero position of the half - wave plate , although this shift is assumed to be corrected in the instrument setup ( n. ageorges , _ priv .",
    "_ ; naco hwp commissioning report ) .",
    "given the numerical agreement ( better than @xmath13 ) we believe that at least in this data set a correction was not applied .",

    "the connection between @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the one side and amplitude and phase of the flux data on the other side is obvious .",
    "this figure already indicates some evolution of the polarisation parameters with time ; details will be discussed below .",
    "data sets , for which the values were consistent with being identical within the errors ( corresponding to a @xmath14 in case of three degrees of freedom ) were not fit in order not to apply a systematically incorrect model .",
    "another effect to be taken into account was the bias caused by the non - zero errors of the flux values .",
    "bias can lead to a systematic overestimation of polarisation fraction and polarised flux especially in cases of low fluxes . in order to check this",
    ", we calculated @xmath7 and polarised flux using analytical expressions for the stokes parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corrected for the bias terms .",

    "as all deviations are zero within the quoted errors , the influence of bias can be safely neglected for the further discussion .",

    "the lightcurves are shown for each polarisation channel separately .",

    "all times mentioned here and elsewhere in this article are minutes after 00:00 ut of the observation day , the first data point obtained is located at @xmath19 min .    from these lightcurves",
    "one can see a strong and fast variability of the flare .",
    "especially interesting is its double peak , which shows flux variations in the order of 7 mjy or 40% within 10 minutes time .",
    "the two maxima of the double peak are separate in time by only 15 minutes . additionally , the different fluxes in the polarimetric channels point towards significant polarisation .",
    "this is demonstrated more directly in fig .",
    "[ photos ] , where the difference of two channels is mapped and compared to a sum image of the vicinity of sgra*. it is important to note that those differences in the polarimetric channels are not visible in the lightcurves of the comparison stars .",
    "this holds for both flux levels corresponding to the peaks of the flare ( s2 ) and for fluxes corresponding to the end of the flare ( s7 ) .    the amount of observed polarised flux from sgra * is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fluxes ] .",
    "the polarised flux shows two maxima at times 405 resp .",
    "420 reaching up to around 2 mjy ; these maxima correspond to the double peak in the lightcurves . during the entire flare",
    "the polarised flux is never lower than @xmath20.6 mjy .",
    "the evolution of the parameters degree and angle of polarisation is presented in fig .",
    "[ params ] .",
    "the degree of polarisation is about 15% at the beginning of the observation and increases after the second main maximum ( @xmath20 ) up to roughly 40% .",
    "this can be seen also in fig .",
    "[ channels ] , were two examples for the fluxes in the four polarimetric channels are given for time bins corresponding to the first peak ( @xmath21 ) resp .",
    "the end of the flare ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the increase is a direct consequence of the fact that the polarised flux level remains roughly constant while the overall flux is decreasing with time after the double peak .    inspecting fig .",
    "[ fluxes ] and [ params ] , it might not be obvious that for times @xmath23 the polarised flux is variable and the degree of polarisation is not . to check this , we computed the reduced @xmath24 for each data set using the assumption that the data do not vary with time .",
    "we find a @xmath25 for the polarised flux , whereas for the degree of polarisation we find @xmath26 .",
    "thus we conclude that indeed only the polarised flux varies for @xmath23 , whereas the degree of polarisation remains constant within the errors .",
    "the polarisation angle remains at a constant level around 80@xmath6 during the time of the double peak , i.e. @xmath27 . the first two data points indicate that the angle could have been even larger before the first peak ; but as this signal is only marginally significant ( 11.5@xmath28 ) , this is completely speculative .",
    "beginning at @xmath29 , @xmath8 swings by about 70@xmath6 within 15 minutes , reaching values down to @xmath210@xmath6 .",
    "this is ( within the errors ) close to the angle of the foreground polarisation ( @xmath225@xmath6 ) .    when discussing the angle of polarisation , one has to keep in mind possible calibration artefacts . as described in sect .",
    "2 , our data are calibrated so that an intrinsically unpolarised source shows a signal corresponding to @xmath30% and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore it is in general possible to observe a source composed of two superposed flux components , a polarised one , and a non - polarised one . as long as both components are significantly bright",
    ", one would measure the polarisation parameters of the polarised source flux .",
    "but when the polarised component fades away , the observed @xmath7 and @xmath8 would move towards the foreground level .",

    "thus we are confident that the description above is valid .",

    "covering times @xmath27 , the double peak occurs , the polarised flux changes rapidly and traces the overall emission , and both degree and angle of polarisation remain constant .    in the second phase ( @xmath20 ) the overall flare slowly fades away while the polarised flux remains on a roughly constant level , leading to an increase in the degree of polarisation .",
    "additionally the swing in polarisation angle occurs .    following the evolution of the flare with time , one has to note that it is highly dynamic on a typical time scale of 15 minutes , which expresses itself in all parameters : the overall flux ( double peak ) , polarised flux , polarisation angle , and degree of polarisation .",

    "for this reason , the shortest period ever measured ( @xmath63  min ; fig .",
    "[ substructure ] and table  [ flaretable ] ) sets a lower limit to the spin parameter @xmath64 of the bh : using @xmath65 ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , this leads to @xmath66 ( following bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the presence of this quasi - periodic sub - structure imposes serious limits on alternative emission scenarii .",
    "_ bow shock fronts _ caused by stars moving through the accretion disc material ( nayakshin et al .",
    "@xcite ) should not show such modulation .    in case of _ jet emission _",
    "( falcke & markoff @xcite , markoff et al .",
    "@xcite , yuan et al .",
    "@xcite ) such modulations would be imprinted on the jet if the jet nozzle was located in the accretion disc , orbiting the black hole .",
    "indeed , the jet model by falcke & markoff @xcite requires a nozzle with a radius of @xmath67 and a height of @xmath68 .",
    "this extension would be small enough to allow for the observed short - time variability .",
    "on the other hand , gillessen et al .",
    "@xcite analyse the cooling time scales of orbiting hot spots and find a limit on the extension of the emission region of 0.3  @xmath58 .",
    "as this would be one order of magnitude smaller than the size of the model jet nozzle , the emission in the _ early _ phases of a flare probably can not be explained by a `` pure '' jet emission model .",
    "this does not exclude the presence of a jet but makes it unlikely that a jet is responsible for a significant part of the observed nir emission .",
    "in the _ end _ or _ decay _ phase of a flare , when a substantial shearing and broadening of the emission region is expected from the hotspot model , a growing contribution from resp .",
    "evolution into a jet is thinkable ; we will pay attention to this again later .",
    "additionally , the observations also do not a priori exclude the possibility of spiral _ density waves _ propagating in the accretion disc .",
    "those oscillations have been discussed in the context of stellar black hole systems in order to explain high - frequency ( khz range ) qpos ( e.g. kato @xcite , ptri @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a rotating two - arm structure could double the orbital time scale and thus loose the constraints on the bh spin .",
    "but those structures are expected to have life times which are shorter than the time of a single orbital revolution ( schnittman et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; this does not agree with the observations of flares lasting for several orbital periods ( up to hours ) .",
    "our description might be somewhat challenged by x - ray observations for which quasi - periodicities as short as 5  min have been claimed ( aschenbach et al .",
    "@xcite , aschenbach @xcite ) . using the dynamical picture",
    "described above , such a short period would require a spin of about @xmath69 .",
    "indeed aschenbach et al .",
    "@xcite claim the detection of several , resonant frequencies in the same flares .",
    "they interpret this as a signature of oscillations in the accretion disc , leading to a spin of @xmath70 and a mass of @xmath71 ( aschenbach @xcite ) .",
    "however , blanger et al .",
    "@xcite find one periodicity of 22  min and no additional signals in the same data sets .",
    "they developed a rigorous statistical method that excludes other ( quasi-)periods being present to a statistically significant level in the data .",
    "this 22-min - period falls in the range of the periods observed in nir flares . from now on",
    ", we implicitly assume that the flare emission comes from matter orbiting the bh .",
    "the fact that the flare emission is polarised nicely confirms the synchrotron radiation nature of the emitted light .",
    "this was already suspected from the overall spectral energy distribution , nir and x - ray colour indices , and the occasional occurrence of simultaneous nir and x - ray flares ( zylka & mezger @xcite , zylka et al .",
    "@xcite , baganoff et al .",
    "@xcite , yuan et al .",
    "@xcite , liu et al .",
    "@xcite , eckart et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , the polarisation parameter curves ( figs .",
    "[ fluxes ] , [ params ] ) convey information about the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "the remarkable permanence of the polarisation parameters , in particular polarisation angle , across three nir flares observed over 2 years ( eckart et al .",
    "@xcite , this work ) indicates that the magnetic field geometry as well as the orbital plane remained the same for all three events .",
    "this shows that the flaring material has enough time to settle in the bh s equatorial plane before the occurrence of the flare , and speaks in favour of a somewhat permanent accretion disc experiencing energetic events rather than temporary structures building up randomly for each flare .      when comparing our data to the models by broderick & loeb @xcite , the non - detection of variations in the polarisation _",
    "angle _ during the peak phase strongly suggests that the accretion disc is seen ( within few degrees ) edge - on .",
    "the non - detection of variations in the polarisation _",
    "fraction _ also speaks for an edge - on view of the disc .",
    "this parameter is not exactly constant , but it would show only a short dip ( @xmath22  min ) that our time sampling would not allow detecting . additionally , the constancy of the polarisation fraction ( about 15% during the peak phase ) speaks against the picture of ( a ) a dominating , slow component of the lightcurves ( e.g. emission from the disc itself ) on top of which ( b ) the periodic signal due to a second component is seen .",
    "such a second component would be unlikely to be subject to the same magnetic field as the bright spot itself . on the contrary , the mechanism proposed by paumard et al",
    ". @xcite by which this slow component is due to shearing of the hotspot , evolving into a ring , fits this observational result well .",
    "there are basically two possible geometries for the magnetic field in the orbiting spot scenario : poloidal ( perpendicular to the orbital plane ) and toroidal ( tangential to the orbit ) .",
    "the poloidal field is more natural in the absence of matter or outside of the disc . on the other end , the field inside the disc is most likely frozen and dragged by the matter . due to shear",
    ", this naturally leads to a toroidal field ( de villiers et al .",
    "@xcite , broderick & loeb @xcite ) .",
    "a transition region above the disc and at its inner edge must exist , in which the magnetic field is somewhat disorganised .",
    "this explains the fairly low observed polarisation fraction ( @xmath215% ; in a perfectly organised field , the polarisation fraction of synchrotron emission is of order 75% , pacholczyk @xcite ) .",
    "the question remains which component of the field is dominant ; we will come back to this later .",
    "the decay part of the flare reported here ( sections 2 , 3 ) shows a dramatic change in both polarisation fraction ( from 15% to 40% ) and polarisation angle ( from 80@xmath6 to 10@xmath6 ) .",
    "it follows that the magnetic field seen by the electrons also changes dramatically .",
    "it becomes much more organised , leading to an increased polarisation fraction , and rotates by @xmath72 .",
    "there are two options to explain this change : either the field changes where the electrons are , or the electrons move to region with a different field geometry .",
    "we will explore both possibilities below .",
    "let us first assume the flaring material remains on the orbital plane : in this case , a change in the magnetic field could be due to the fact that the accretion disc vanishes , letting the magnetic field relax into its matter - less state , which is poloidal .",
    "this means that the field was mostly toroidal during the peak phase .",
    "the same conclusion is reached if the matter leaves the disc from its inner edge , falling onto the bh .",
    "the other possibility is that the material moves out of the accretion disc .",
    "since the flares are magnetically driven , it seems natural to assume that this matter would follow the field lines , perhaps into a jet . here",
    "again , the final magnetic field is likely poloidal , hence the initial field is toroidal .    in these two schemes ,",
    "the field is toroidal during the peak phase and poloidal during the decay phase .",
    "we now assume that this is the case .",
    "a toroidal field in the peak phase is yet another hint that the material has settled into a disc and been able to drag the field before the occurrence of the flare .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the galactic plane , which is located at @xmath73 , contains additional information .",
    "indeed the peak phase polarisation angle is roughly perpendicular to the galactic plane ( to within @xmath230 degrees ) , whereas the decay phase polarisation angle is mostly in the galactic plane ( to within @xmath210 degrees ) .",
    "we therefore see here an indication that the accretion disc of sgr  a * lies essentially in the plane of the galaxy , and that its spin axis is essentially aligned with that of the galaxy .",
    "but as long as there are no stricter constraints on the polarised nir emission from sgra * , it is possible that future observations revise this picture .      given together , we state that our data support the following model : sgra * is a fairly rapidly ( perhaps maximally ) rotating bh .",
    "its spin axis is essentially aligned with that of the galaxy .",
    "it is surrounded by a somewhat permanent accretion disc , with an inner edge close to the isco , in which the magnetic field is toroidal . outside of this disc ,",
    "the field is poloidal .",
    "occasionally , shear will bend the magnetic field so much that a magnetic reconnection is warranted .",
    "this is most likely to occur near the inner edge of the disc , where shear is most effective .",
    "the magnetic reconnection heats a fraction of the electrons to a hot temperature ( @xmath74 k ) .",
    "the region affected is localised , smaller than the contraint imposed by cooling - time arguments in gillessen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : @xmath75 .",
    "these electrons swirl in the toroidal magnetic field and emit synchrotron emission .",
    "the emitting region orbits the bh , giving raise to the periodic signal we observe .",
    "shear as well as magnetic forces make the region extend along the orbit .",
    "since it spans only a small range in distance from the bh , the shear is not extremely fast and allows the periodic signal to be discernable for several periods .",
    "nevertheless , within a few orbital periods , the entire isco glows in synchrotron emission , and this emission is responsible for the dominating , slow part of the lightcurves ( paumard et al .",
    "@xcite ) . after some time",
    ", the magnetic reconnection is over , removing the heating mechanism from the picture .",
    "the electron population cools down , and at the same time extend outside of the disc , perhaps into a jet .",
    "the dominating field then becomes poloidal .",
    "on may 31st , 2006 , we observed a @xmath0 band flare from sgra * which shows    * a high level of total flux , up to @xmath216  mjy ; * strong , variable polarisation , with @xmath7615 ... 40% ; * a polarisation angle between @xmath42 ( during the peak phase ) and @xmath77 ( in the decay phase ) , swinging within about 15 minutes ; * repeated sub - structure ( double peak in total and polarised flux ) on a time scale of 15  min .    using this as well as information gathered during the last years from radio , nir , and x - ray observations ,",
    "we see strong indication that the flare emission in sgra * is the synchrotron emission from material orbiting the bh .",
    "we also find indication that some of this material eventually makes it into a jet , reconciling the `` orbiting spot scenario '' tenants with the jet hypothesis literature ( markoff et al .",
    "@xcite , yuan et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we might have observed the first pieces of evidence that a smbh spin axis is aligned with that of its host galaxy .",
