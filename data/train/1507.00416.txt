    "in situ measurements of the magnetic , electric , and density fluctuations in the solar wind provide valuable information on nonlinear dynamics of a nearly collisionless astrophysical plasma . at large hydrodynamic scales ( corresponding to low frequencies in the measurements )",

    "such turbulence exhibits a break , which corresponds to the spatial scale broadly consistent with the plasma microscales such as the ion gyroradius or the ion inertial length .",
    "it has been proposed that the spectral break in the solar wind and other astrophysical plasmas can mark a transition from the non - dispersive alfvn modes to the dispersive kinetic - alfvn modes @xcite .",
    "a possibility of transition to whistler turbulence has also been considered @xcite , however , recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that whistler turbulence , if present at subpropton scales , contributes only a small fraction of fluctuations energy .",
    "a conclusion is then drawn that the spectral break occurs at the proton gyroscale .",
    "a recent work by @xcite tested this prediction by analyzing the solar wind intervals having very large and very small plasma beta , the ratio of the kinetic energy of the plasma particles to the magnetic energy . in particular , the intervals were selected with ion and electron plasma beta satisfying @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in the first case , the theory of oblique alfvnic turbulence predicts the break at the ion gyroscale , in the second one at the ion acoustic scale .",

    "this puzzling result may question the applicability of the theory of turbulent cascade to the solar wind plasma .",
    "we address this contradiction by inspecting the theory of alfvn turbulence in the limiting cases of large and small plasma beta .",
    "we consider various mechanisms that may be responsible for the spectral break , including the possibility that the major assumption of the standard theory , the obliquity of propagation , can break down in the case @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for the latter possibility is upscatter of the alfvnic fluctuations due to their interactions with the ion - acoustic modes and the fast modes that are weakly damped in a non - isothermal low - beta plasma .",
    "the afvnic turbulence then develops a non - oblique component @xmath3 , which is dissipated due to the ion cyclotron resonance at the ion inertial scale thus explaining the observed spectral break in this case .",
    "in what follows we will use the notation : @xmath4 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath5 is the thermal velocity associated with the particles of kind @xmath6 . for a plasma consisting of electrons and ions , the so - called ion - acoustic velocity can be defined , @xmath7 .",

    "<S> recent observations reveal that magnetic turbulence in the nearly colisionless solar wind plasma extends to scales smaller than the plasma microscales , such as ion gyroradius and ion inertial length . measured breaks in the spectra of magnetic and density fluctuations at high frequencies are thought to be related to the transition from large - scale hydromagnetic to small - scale kinetic turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the scales of such transitions and the responsible physical mechanisms are not well understood however . in the present work we emphasize the crucial role of the plasma parameters in the transition to kinetic turbulence , such as the ion and electron plasma beta , the electron to ion temperature ratio , the degree of obliquity of turbulent fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose an explanation for the spectral breaks reported in recent observations . </S>"
