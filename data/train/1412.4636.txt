    "observationally , this effect was detected , e.g. , toward the protoplanetary disk around v380 ori @xcite , where the oh p4.5 line profile is asymmetric .",
    "the origin of this asymmetry is most likely the stellar companion of v380 ori which perturbs the gas motion in the inner disk .        in the case of hd 100546",

    "the fwhm of the convolution is given by the actual size of the target in the spatial direction of the spectrum ( table  [ tab : log ] ) : this corresponds to 017 for the spectra taken with the 02 slit ( pa = 26@xmath2 and 10@xmath2 ) and 065 in the case of the 04 slit ( pa = 90@xmath2 ) .",
    "the synthetic line profiles are created by filtering the convolved disk images with the corresponding slit width and position angle .",
    "the effect of a slit misalignment , is reproduced by an offset between the slit and the stellar position , in the direction perpendicular to the slit pa .",
    "the sign convention for the offset is the same as in @xcite .",
    "finally , the synthetic line profiles are convolved with the corresponding spectral resolution : 3.5  and 5.3  for the 02 and 04 slit width , respectively ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : offset ] shows the synthetic spectra for different offsets in the cases of pa=10@xmath2 and pa=90@xmath2 : the offset produces an asymmetry in the line profile , and the flux ratio between the blue- and red- shifted component of the oh line increases with the offset . for a given offset ,",
    "the asymmetry is more pronounced in the narrow slit spectrum .",
    "this is due to the different size of the psf .",
    "the spectra are normalized although the offset induces slit losses which results in a fainter line flux as the offset increases .",
    "a small offset ( between -004 and -006 ) is enough to reproduce the observed profile at pa=10@xmath2 , while a larger offset ( between -016 and -020 ) is needed for the pa=@xmath4 spectrum .",
    "the analysis presented here demonstrates that the asymmetric profile of the oh ro - vibrational lines are consistent with an offset between the slit and the stellar position .",
    "our interpretation is that the spectra which are mostly affected by the slit mis - alignment are the pa=10@xmath2 and pa=90@xmath2 ( both crires and phoenix ) .",
    "the pa=26@xmath2 spectrum shows indeed no clear evidence of asymmetry in the line profile which appears instead top- flat as we would expect in the case of keplerian rotation .",
    "moreover , in the same spectrum the line is much stronger ( almost double , table  [ tab : log ] ) than in the other spectra .",
    "this finding suggest that the pa=10@xmath2 and pa=90@xmath2 spectra can be affected by slit losses which is a natural consequence of the slit mis - alignment .",
    "the small offsets estimated in the previous section produce negligible or no change of the continuum flux but considerable variation of the oh line velocity profile .      if the asymmetric profile of the oh line is due to an offset of the slit , this must be caused by the source itself as it is observed with two different instruments ( crires and phoenix ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that the misalignment of the slit is caused by a non homogenous illumination : we infer that this is due to the finite size of the disk inner wall at @xmath74au from the star . because of the disk inclination ( @xmath75 ) the inner wall at 10 - 14au produces an asymmetric image in the sky ( see figure  [ fig : disk ] ) .",
    "interestingly , deviation from axis - symmetric emission is detected in mid - infrared interferometric observations @xcite .",
    "given the higher intensity of the disk wall over the stellar photosphere at wavelength @xmath76 , the peak of the continuum intensity at these wavelengths does not coincide with the stellar position .",
    "since the telescope pointing is automatically adjusted toward the peak of the emission in the k@xmath77 band in the slit viewer camera , this can affect the centering of the target inside the slit , inducing an offset between the center of the slit and the stellar position .",
    "the misalignment of the slit should be maximum when the slit pa is parallel to the disk major axis ( @xmath78 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it should be minimized when the slit is oriented along the disk minor axis .",
    "this is consistent with the different offset measured in the pa=@xmath4 and pa = @xmath73 spectra and with the symmetric profile seen in the pa=@xmath79 ( closer to the disk minor axis ) spectrum .",
    "the slit position angles at the three epochs are also shown .",
    "the dashed region shows the side of the disk which appears brighter in polarized light from @xcite and @xcite.,width=340 ]    our interpretation is supported by the polarimetric differential imaging ( pdi ) of hd 100546 performed by @xcite and @xcite : the authors detect a brightness asymmetry in polarized light with the north - east part ( far side ) of the disk being brighter than the southern - west one ( near side ) .",
    "the azimuthal directions of this asymmetry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] .",
    "we further note that our interpretation is in good agreement with near - infrared interferometric observations @xcite : the k - band vlti/ amber visibility at short baselines can only be fitted by a model which includes spatially extended emission , consistent with the disk inner wall at @xmath80au @xcite .",
    "there are other possible scenarios that can induce a slit offset : any bright source ( brighter than the star in the k - band ) within @xmath10 02 from the star could induce a mis - alignment of the slit during the acquisition of the spectrum .",
    "one possibility is a stellar companion , there are however no detections of any bright companion within 02 to date . another possibility is inhomogeneous dust continuum emission from the disk .",
    "recent polarimetric observations by @xcite rule out the presence of a disk hole at pa=@xmath81 claimed by @xcite while they detect two bright spots at pa@xmath82 and pa@xmath83 with the latter being brighter than the first one .",
    "we warn however that the spots seen in polarized light do not necessarily imply the existence of bright spots in the total ( unpolarized ) k - band flux .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are instead consistent with the overall geometry of the disk where the north - east side ( brighter in scattered light ) is facing toward us .",
    "@xcite suggest that the inner disk of hd 100546 is eccentric and the oh distribution is not homogeneous : the authors propose a scenario in which a massive ( unseen ) planet perturbs the gas dynamics at the distance of the disk inner wall .",
    "@xcite further support this scenario based on the non - variability of the oh line profiles : the oh spectra presented by @xcite are both taken with the same slit pa ( = 90@xmath2 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : phoenix ] however , the pa=@xmath4 spectra ( crires and phoenix ) do show a slightly different line profile , which can not be due to disk eccentricity .",
    "moreover , the pa=10@xmath2 and pa=26@xmath2 spectra show drastic variation in line profile and equivalent width .",
    "@xcite assume an eccentricity of 0.18 ( @xmath240.11 ) to explain the asymmetry of the oh lines .",

    "based on the data collected here and on the performed analysis , the asymmetric profile of the oh ro - vibrational lines toward hd 100546 are consistent with a misalignment of the slit of the order of @xmath85 .",
    "we argue that the misalignment results from the finite size of the disk inner wall at @xmath86au from the star ( @xmath87 at a distance of 97pc ) .",
    "thus there is no need to invoke a highly eccentric gas disk , as was done by @xcite , to explain the asymmetric line profile in hd 100546 .",

    "<S> no oh emission is detected within a radius of @xmath3au from the star : the line emitting region is similar in size and extent to that of the co ro - vibrational lines . in the other two epochs ( march 2013 and april 2014 , pa=@xmath4 and 10@xmath2 , respectively ) the oh lines appear asymmetric and fainter compared to april 2012 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the origin of these line asymmetries which were taken by previous authors as evidence for tidal interaction between an ( unseen ) massive planet and the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed asymmetries can be fully explained by a misalignment of the slit of order 004 - 020 with respect to the stellar position . </S>",
    "<S> the disk is spatially resolved and the slit misalignment is likely caused by the extended dust emission which is brighter than the stellar photosphere at near - infrared wavelengths which is the wavelength used for the pointing . </S>",
    "<S> this can cause the photo - center of hd 100546 to be mis - aligned with the stellar position at near - infrared wavelengths . </S>"
