    "the hot x - ray emitting gas of elliptical galaxies represents an important interface between galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( perhaps even the _ primary _ interface ) .",
    "the x - ray halos of ellipticals carry with them two fundamental mysteries :    * their x - ray luminosities are lower than that expected from an extrapolation of the cluster x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath1 ) relation ( e.g. matsushita et  al . 2000 ) . * their x - ray metallicities are lower than that of the mean stellar iron abundance ( the so - called `` iron discrepancy '' - e.g. arimoto et  al .",
    "1997 - a `` discrepancy '' in the sense that the halo gas metallicity was expected to exceed that of the stars , since it should bear the pollution of the enrichment from earlier generation of stars - enrichment byproducts that were not locked up into subsequent stellar generations ) .",
    "conversely , the optical properties of ellipticals appear less contentious ! the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) and fundamental plane provide strong constraints for any elliptical galaxy formation paradigm .",
    "we present here our preliminary work aimed ultimately at the construction of successful self - consistent optical @xmath2 x - ray cosmological chemodynamical simulations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "in our simulations , the dynamics of collisionless dark matter and stars is calculated using a gravitational tree n - body code , and the gas component is modeled using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "we calculate radiative cooling , star formation , chemical enrichment , and supernovae ( sne ) feedback , self - consistently , and take into account both type  ia and type  ii sne .",
    "we assume that sne feedback is released as thermal energy .",
    "details of the code are presented in kawata ( 2001 ) and kawata & gibson ( 2003 , in prep ) .",
    "we have carried out a series of high - resolution simulations within the adopted standard @xmath3cdm cosmology ( @xmath4=0.3 , @xmath5=0.7 , @xmath6=0.019@xmath7 , @xmath8=0.7 , and @xmath9=0.9 ) .",
    "gas dynamics and star formation are included only within the relevant high - resolution region ( @xmath1012  mpc at @xmath11=0 ) ; the surrounding low - resolution region ( @xmath1043  mpc ) contributes to the high - resolution region only through gravity .",
    "the mass of individual gas particles in the high - resolution region was @xmath12  @xmath13 .",
    "we next identified an appropriate elliptical galaxy analog in the high - resolution region , which acts as the focus for this preliminary study .",
    "the total virial mass of this target galaxy is @xmath14  @xmath15 , similar in size to that of ngc  4472 , a bright elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "the target galaxy is relatively isolated , with only a few low - mass satellites remaining at @xmath11=0 .",
    "figure [ evol - fig ] shows the morphological evolution of dark matter in the simulation volume , and the evolution of the stellar component in a 200  kpc region centred on the target galaxy .",
    "the galaxy forms through conventional hierarchical clustering between redshifts @xmath11=3 and @xmath11=1 ; the morphology has not changed dramatically since @xmath11=1 .",
    "three different radiative cooling and sne feedback models were considered : model  a is an adiabatic model ( i.e. no cooling ) ; model  b includes cooling and weak feedback ; model  c mimics model  b , but incorporates stronger feedback ( 100 times larger thermal energy per supernova ) .    for all the models , we examine both the resulting x - ray _ and _ optical properties , comparing them quantitatively with observation .",
    "the gas particles in our simulations carry with them knowledge of the density , temperature , and abundances of various heavy elements in their immediate vicinity . using the xspec vmekal plasma model",
    ", we derive the x - ray spectra for each gas particle , and synthesize them within the assumed aperture ( r@xmath1020  kpc ) .",
    "we next generate `` fake '' spectra with the response function of xmm epn detector , assuming an exposure time ( 40  ks ) and target galaxy distance ( 17  mpc ) .",
    "finally , our xpsec fitting provides the x - ray weighted temperatures and abundances of various elements .",
    "conversely , the simulated star particles each carry their own age and metallicity `` tag '' , which enables us to generate an optical - to - near infrared spectral energy distribution for the target galaxy , when combined with our population synthesis code adopting simple stellar populations of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ lxt - fig ] shows the predicted @xmath16 relation for the three models at @xmath11=0 ; crosses with error bars represent the observational data from matsushita et  al .",
    "the adiabatic model ( model  a ) appears incompatible with the data due to its excessive luminosity and low temperature .",
    "the inclusion of radiative cooling leads to lower luminosities and higher temperatures - as a result , models with cooling ( models b and c ) are ( roughly ) consistent with the @xmath16 relation of the observed elliptical galaxies .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with the analysis of muanwong et  al .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ lxt - fig ] shows the effect of cooling more clearly . in the gas density versus temperature diagrams",
    ", the region above than the line corresponds to a parameter space in which the cooling time is shorter than the hubble time .",
    "cooling ensures the gas within this region is cold ( ie .",
    "non x - ray emitting ) , and of low density and high temperature , ensuring that ultimately radiative cooling drives the observed @xmath16 relation .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ lxfecmr - fig ] compares the x - ray weighted iron abundance of our simulations with the observational data of matsushita et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) . as the adiabatic model ( by construction )",
    "does not form any stars ( not having any cooling ! ) , we show the results only for models  b and c. both these models show lower gas - phase iron abundance , compared to their stellar abundance , consistent with the low iron abundances observed in the x - ray emitting gas of ellipticals .",
    "we find that a large fraction of iron ejected from stars is locked into future generation of stars .",
    "stars preferentially enrich the gas in the central region , where cooling is efficient ( right panel of figure  [ lxt - fig ] ) .",
    "the enriched gas can then cool easily and be incorporated into future generations of stars .",
    "consequently , the hot gaseous halo has not been enriched efficiently , leading to a lower x - ray weighted iron abundance .    in summary ,",
    "our radiative cooling models explain the two x - ray `` mysteries '' alluded to in section  1 .",
    "having said that , any successful scenario must also explain the optical properties of the underlying stellar component . to this end",
    ", we examined the position of our simulated target galaxy in the observed coma cluster cmr ( bower et  al .",
    "we can see immediately that the colours of the resulting stellar components of both models  b and c are inconsistent with the data ( being too blue ) .",
    "this inconsistency can be traced to an excessive population of young and intermediate age stars ( @xmath178  gyr ) which form from successively cooled gas , regardless of the strength of sne feedback .",
    "if the contribution of these young stars was ignored , the resulting colours would match the observed cmr .",
    "therefore , one exotic ( if somewhat _",
    "ad hoc _ ) solution is to `` hide '' these younger stars within a bottom - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) such that they can not be seen today even if they did exist ( e.g. fabian et  al .",
    "1982 ; mathews & brighenti 1999 ) .",
    "another ( more plausible ) possibility is that extra heating sources , such as intermittent agn activity , suppress star formation at low redshift . before suggesting this is the true solution though ,",
    "we must re - examine the predicted x - ray properties of the simulation end - products after introducing these additional heating sources ; we will be pursuing this comparison in a future paper .",
    "our cosmological chemodynamical code makes it possible to undertake quantitative comparisons between numerical simulations and observational data in both the x - ray and optical regime with minimal assumptions .",
    "we find that radiative cooling is required to explain the observed x - ray luminosity , temperature , and metallicity of elliptical galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting cooled gas also leads to unavoidable overproduction of young and intermediate age stellar populations , at odds with the observational constraints .",
    "although a bottom - heavy imf is one solution for this problem , extra heating by intermittent agn activity seems to be more plausible ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 2002 ) ; recent observations are consistent with this latter picture ( e.g. churazov et  al . 2001 ) .",
