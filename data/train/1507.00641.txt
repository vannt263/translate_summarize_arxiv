    "we consider in this paper numerical computation of highly oscillatory integrals defined on a bounded interval whose integrands have the form @xmath0 , where the wave number @xmath1 is large , the amplitude function @xmath2 may have weak singularities , and the oscillator @xmath3 has stationary points of certain order .",
    "computing highly oscillatory integrals is of importance in wide application areas ranging from quantum chemistry , computerized tomography , electrodynamics and fluid mechanics . for a large wave number @xmath1 , the integrands oscillate rapidly and cancel themselves over most of the range .",
    "cancelation dose not occur in the neighborhoods of critical points of the integrand ( the endpoints of the integration domain and the stationary points of the oscillator ) .",
    "efficiency of a quadrature of highly oscillatory integrals depends on the behavior of functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 near the critical points .",
    "traditional methods for evaluating oscillatory integrals become expensive when the wave number @xmath1 is large , since the number of the evaluations of the integrand used grows linearly with the wave number @xmath1 in order to obtain certain order of accuracy .",
    "the calculation of the integrals is widely perceived as a _",
    "issue . calculating oscillatory integrals",
    "requires special effort .",
    "the interest in the highly oscillatory integrals has led to much progress in developing numerical quadrature formulas for computing these integrals . in the literature , there are mainly four classes of methods for the computation : asymptotic methods , filon - type methods , levin - type methods and numerical steepest descent methods .",
    "the basis for convergence analysis of these quadrature rules is the asymptotic expansion of the oscillatory integral , an asymptotic expansion in negative powers of the wave number @xmath1 .",
    "the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion may be derived from integration by parts @xcite for the case when the oscillator has no stationary point . for the case when the oscillator has stationary points ,",
    "the main tool is the method of stationary phase @xcite . for a fixed wave number",
    ", the convergence order of the asymptotic method is rather low . to overcome this weakness ,",
    "the filon - type methods @xcite were proposed , which replace the amplitude function @xmath2 by a suitable interpolating function . in many situations",
    "the convergence order of the filon - type methods is significantly higher than that of the asymptotic methods",
    ". a thorough qualitative understanding of these methods and the analysis of their convergence order may be found in @xcite for the univariate case and in @xcite for the multivariate case . in these methods ,",
    "interpolation at the chebyshev points ensures convergence @xcite .",
    "a drawback of the filon - type methods is that they require to compute the moments , which themselves are oscillatory integrals . for the cases having nonlinear oscillators , it is not always possible to compute the moments exactly . in @xcite ,",
    "the moment - free filon - type methods were developed .",
    "an entirely different approach without computing the moments is the levin collocation method @xcite .",
    "the levin - type methods @xcite reduce computation of the oscillatory integral to a simple problem of finding the antiderivative @xmath4 of the integrand , where @xmath4 satisfies the differential equation @xmath5 .",
    "the filon - type methods and the levin - type methods with polynomials bases are identical for the cases having the linear oscillator but not for the cases having the nonlinear oscillator @xcite .",
    "numerical steepest descent methods @xcite for removing the oscillation converts the real integration interval into a path in the complex plane , with a standard quadrature method used to calculate the resulting complex integral .",
    "although many methods were proposed for computing oscillatory integrals in the literatures , there are still a big room for improving their approximation accuracy and computational efficiency . the filon - type and",
    "levin - type methods require interpolating the derivatives of the amplitude @xmath2 at critical points in order to achieve a higher convergence order .",
    "even though computing derivatives can be avoided by allowing the interpolation points to approach the critical points as the wave number increases for the formula proposed in @xcite , the moments can not always be explicitly computed . in particular",
    ", certain special functions were used for calculating the oscillatory integrals in the case when @xmath2 has singularities and @xmath3 has stationary points .",
    "the formulas proposed in @xcite do not require computing the special functions and the moments of these formulas can be computed exactly , at the expenses of computing the inverse of the oscillator , which takes up much computing time .",
    "numerical steepest descent methods also require computing the inverse of the oscillator or high order derivatives of the integrand @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop efficient composite quadrature rules for computing highly oscillatory integrals with singularities and stationary points .",
    "the methods to be described in this paper require neither computing the moments of the integrand , inverting the oscillator , nor calculating the derivatives of @xmath2 and those of @xmath6 .",
    "the main idea used here is to divide the integration interval into subintervals according to the wave number @xmath1 and the singularity of the integrand . to avoid using the special functions , we first split the integration interval into the subintervals according to the singularity of @xmath2 and the stationary points of @xmath3 such that the integrand on the subintervals either has a weak singularity but no oscillation , or has oscillation but no singularity or stationary point .",
    "the weakly singular integrals are calculated by the classical quadratures using graded points @xcite . to avoid using the derivatives of @xmath2 and those of @xmath6 and avoid computing the inverse of the oscillator , we design a composite quadrature formulas using a partition of the subinterval formed according to the wave number @xmath1 and the property of the oscillator @xmath3 for the oscillatory integrals .",
    "these formulas can improve the approximation accuracy effectively , since the convergence order of the formulas computing the oscillatory integrals with smooth integrand and without stationary point may be increased by adding more internal interpolation nodes .",
    "specifically , we develop two classes of composite moment - free quadrature formulas for the highly oscillatory integrals . class one uses a fixed number of quadrature nodes in each subinterval and has a polynomial order of convergence .",
    "this class of formulas are stable and easy to implement .",
    "class two uses variate numbers of quadrature nodes in the subintervals and achieves an exponential order of convergence .",
    "convergence order of this class of formulas is higher than that of the first class .",
    "the quadrature formulas proposed in this paper have the following advantages . comparing with the existing formulas ,",
    "the proposed formulas need not computing the inverse of the nonlinear oscillator , or utilizing the incomplete gamma function @xcite for the oscillator with stationary points .",
    "these formulas not only reduce the computational complexity , but also enhance the approximation accuracy . the approximation accuracy of these formulas is higher than that of the existing formulas for the case when the oscillator integral has stationary points and the oscillator is not easy to invert .    we organize this paper in seven sections . in section 2 , we present an improved moment - free filon - type method for the oscillatory integrals developed in @xcite . in section 3 , we design a partition of the integration interval and propose composite moment - free filon - type methods for the oscillatory integrals with smoothing integrand and without a stationary point . in sections 4 and 5 , we develop the composite moment - free quadratures defined on a mesh according to the wave number @xmath1 and the properties of the integrand for the oscillatory integrals with both singularities and stationary points .",
    "the formulas proposed in section 4 have a polynomial order of convergence , and those in section 5 have an exponential order of convergence .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section 6 to confirm the theoretical estimates on the accuracy of the proposed formulas .",
    "moreover , we compare the numerical performance of the proposed formulas with that of those recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 7 .",
